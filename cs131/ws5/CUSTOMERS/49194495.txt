After I started reading Cain, specifically Double Indemnity, I decided that I should brush up on good ole' American detective novels.  Chandler, no doubt, is considered to amongst the Pantheon of American detective writers. <br /> <br />The Big Sleep is the first novel by Cain.  I admire the gritty Los Angeles of the 1930s that Cain presents.  His main character, Marlowe, is a  tough yet sarcastic detective whose off to solve a blackmail problem for a certain wealthy family.  Marlowe then gets involved with Murder, more blackmail, organized crime, and more. <br /> <br />There are quite a few good things about this novel.  The way he describes Los Angeles is both pertinent to the novel, and fun to read by itself.  The snappy one liners and tough guy attitude both presents a noir type image for Marlowe, while allowing for humor.  The characters, though outlandish, are indeed interesting and add to depth of the novel. <br /> <br />There were some problems that I just couldn't get past though.  First and foremost is the lack of continuity and fluidity.  Chandler places a lot of emphasis on descriptions of buildings and atmosphere.  While adding to the novel in some aspects, it bogs down the reader in many other aspects.  It's also a pretty hard to follow book for today's reader.  I'm not sure if it's his unique writing style that hasn't quite been developed, if the reader expected something different in the 30s, the language and colloquialisms have changed, or a combination of all of the above.  Often times I found myself re-reading a few paragraphs and still being a bit confused about the exact situation. <br /> <br />Finally, the book just kind of gets out there.  It goes from blackmail to some murder with pornographers, to nude photographs, and casinos and such.  With the fluidity and difficulty in reading this book, it magnified the lack of realism and outlandishness that I wouldn't really expect from a realistic detective novel. <br /> <br />All in all, I admire the book, but I can't really say I enjoyed it.	2005-07-16

I was told that his writing style matures and is easier to follow and grasp in later books.  And yes, that is true in his second book. <br /> <br />Farewell My Lovely is a novel about a hard nosed L.A. detective name Phillip Marlowe.  Marlowe is the master and snappy one liners and sarcasm.  Chandler brings Marlowe to the L.A. area and delves him into the world of 1940s noir crime, with excellent description and tons of ambiance befitting the genre. <br /> <br />At first, Marlowe encounters a murder by near accident, and without giving away the plot, he is entwined in a much deeper scandal with many different type of characters throughout the area, from a curious woman, to psychics, corrupt cops, organized crime leaders, and crooked sanitariums.   <br /> <br />Near the end, the book become a little harder to follow, and the plot turns and twists become a little too much, but all in all, it's a great detective novel.	2005-07-16

Readable, with plenty of examples, it explains everything and provides almost the all required information needed to start programming for Series 40 (and Series 60) phones - assuming you only know Java. <br /> <br />I read this out of pure curiosity, and I must say, I learned all that I needed and much more.  It taught everything from internet connectivity, automated building, testing, compiling, and security from secure minded applications to fun 2D games.  It's really an amazing book that probably combines a lot of different random white papers from various different perspectives and presents in a complete, comprehensive and clear manner.  The examples are informative, representative of real world applications, and are easy to follow. <br /> <br />I found some things to be needlessly verbose, and I wish there were better summaries of objects and inheritance between the required classes, but all in all, it easily provides the foundation needed to create, debug, and test almost any J2ME mobile phone application around.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.	2005-06-23

In this really short book (115 pages), Cain describes how Huff, an insurance agent, teams up with a women to kill the women's husband and collect the insurance money.  Being the man who sold the insurance policy, he designs an elaborate and almost fool proof murder in order to collect the money and get with the woman.  Obviously, things don't quite as planned. <br /> <br />This book is well written, compact, immensely readable.  Full of intrigue, suspense, it's both smart and fun.  The only problem I found was that I finished too quickly.  This was suppose to be a weekend read and I finished it Saturday afternoon. <br /> <br />All in all, it's the ultimate Noir book.  The book emphasis the planning of the murder and double crossing that accompanies it.  I would say you should read this right away.	2005-05-15

This usually results in a muddled, incomprehensible mess.  Not in this case.  He successfully pulls off the greatest act of intrigue ever, by intentionally leaving the reader as clueless as the main character. <br /> <br />The main character is brought to Washington under false pretenses to discover that his weekend party with three other couple may be a meeting of some Omega agents.  The only problem is, no one knows who is and who isn't part of Omega.  Now the main character has got to lead a double life, protect his family against Omega, figure out who are his true friends, and worry about the CIA protection.  <br /> <br />While the middle of the book feels kind of jumbled, and beginning of the book is slightly dull, the book is immensely readable and fun.  Definitely not an action packed book (not until the end at least), Ludlum instead brings the low-key mundane trivialities of life into a new light.  Does a particular sentence reveal something about his or her loyalties, does weary a gaudy piece of jewelry mean your connected with an organization?  Finding out the truth behind everything becomes harder and more alluring than ever. <br /> <br />All in all, I would recommend this quick page turner.	2005-05-15

This book is called Origins of the Crash.  I would think that this would be an all encompassing book describing both the irrationality of all aspects of the stock bubble that burst, relying on firm statistics, polls and the such.  However, instead, this book concentrates on just a few corporations and a few select people, and is just left to the reader to extrapolate this to the entire market.  While I don't disagree with the actions of a few select people or corporations helped precipitate the decline in stocks, I didn't see how that explained everything, and I see this book as an incomplete exercise. <br /> <br />While the title is huge misnomer, the explanation of corruption, cronyism, false beliefs, lack of credibility and accountability is very well done.  He talks about how CEO pay and their pay structure are not aligned with shareholder value.  He goes into how the SEC was very lax during this time.  He spends a brief amount of time on the conflict of interests between investment houses and corporations (and the media's role).  He then delves into the internet fallacies that many saw as gospel in the late nineties.  He finally ends with a detailed explanation of the problems of Enron/Anderson and Worldcom. <br /> <br />While detailed and mostly readable (though dry at some points), there was also a sense of smugness and a condescension that I felt hurt his credibility. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a decent, yet incomplete read.	2005-05-02

If there is one word to describe this book, it's wow.  This book is intriguing, eye-opening, exciting, touching, and mesmerizing.  One of the best books I've ever read. <br /> <br />Billy McQueen, ATF agent, joins the Mongols outlaw motorcycle gang as Billy St. Jean, giving up his personal life, living in certain danger, and even fighting ATF bureaucracy in order to prosecute the toughest and dangerous motorcycle gang around (the only gang to humble the Hell's Angels).   <br /> <br />This has all the qualities and excitement of any action movie.  What separates this from a movie is that this was all real.  The sacrifices this man made are amazing. <br /> <br />He details the pain of initiation, the side stepping of the issue of drug taking, the constant harassment of the police, the constant threat of being outed, and climbing the ladder of the Mongol hierarchy.  He delves the life of Mongol outlaw, the surprisingly strict Mongol organizational structure, the violent crimes they initiate, their history, their significance, their rituals. <br /> <br />He transforms the reader, as he explains his own transformation, to a full-fledged Mongol officer.  He shows the extremely volatile, yet sometimes sympathetic nature of being in a motorcycle gang.  He both explains the dichotomy of people who both love Mongol Billy St. Jean, but would not hesitate to kill ATF agent Billy McQueen.  He personally tells of the bonds he formed with some of the members.  One could tell the pain he experienced in prosecuting his fellow gang-members at the end of the book. <br /> <br />This is truly one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read - one I could not put down.	2005-05-02

I guess this book was recently re-released, because for the longest time, it was the only Elvis Cole novel that I couldn't find in any book store.  Well, now that it's out, it a pretty standard Elvis Cole novel.  And that's fine by me. <br /> <br />Without giving too much away, a rich and famous man is accused of murdering his wife.  He's hired by the defense to look for dirt on the women who arrived at the crime scene, and investigate other materials.  Elvis has his doubts on some of his leads, and he uses his investigative clues and his partner, Joe Pike, to figure it all out. <br /> <br />Though it gets somewhat outlandish in the end, this book provides a good mixture of intrigue, detective work, back-stabbing and more.  As usual, it's a fun fluid read, and I recommend it.	2005-05-01

Jose Canseco obviously wrote this book to cash in on his last few moments of fame.  That's fine.  Ostracized by baseball, he partially wrote this book as revenge.  Fine by me.    Most people either bought this book because of this, or have refused to buy this book because of it.  Once people get past their initial excitement or hang-ups, they'll find a pretty good read nonetheless. <br /> <br />This is honest, sometimes amusing, and a good page turner.  Jose Canseco fully admits his mistakes in terms of steroids.  He spends a considerable amount of time talking about how he used steroids, how he helped others, and even though he's entirely wrong, which even he admitted later on, he does explain the supposed benefits of steroids.   <br /> <br />The best part is to hear someone's interpretation of baseball.  Whether you agree or not, he does bring up some interesting topics.  He asks why did the Rangers (and owner George W. Bush) trade for a well known steroid abuser?  He explains the complex and possibly corrupt relationship between umpires and players.  He talks about players cheating on their wives.  He explains the media and how it props up certain players. <br /> <br />He also explains the details of his personal life.  Though standard fair, it's still pretty interesting.  It's about his experience growing up, his ex-wife, his cars, his daughter, etc.  The Madonna chapter was quite surprising because of how, well, dull, it all was. <br /> <br />The one thing that hurts his credibility in the book is the constant self-victimization he perpetuates.  You get the feeling that he thinks everyone is after him.  After reading this, you feel that Canseco honestly believes that Major league baseball, the Florida police, the media, and the umpires are in some OJ type conspiracy to get Jose Canseco. <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoyed reading it.  It's a short yet fluid read.  I found it insightful, amusing, and interesting.  Though I don't entirely agree or believe everything he writes, it's influence on baseball is undeniable.	2005-05-01

I fully admit my grammatical failings.  I admit it, I'm just not that good.  So, I figured that I could polish up on my weakness by reading this book.  Did it help?  Yes, and  no.  It did provide a lot of common problems and it did clarify when to use many words (e.g. I versus me, them versus they), and unlike many other books that take dry reference materials and tranform them into readable books, it has a good glossary!  The first few chapter provided a lot of good info and was suprisingly fluid. <br /> <br />After the first few chapters, the book gets really, well, boring.  About 30 pages are devoted to words that are often mistaken for one another.  Many of them I already knew, and I just trudged through word after word.  It kind of felt like the I was reading a dictionary. <br /> <br />I also found that tenses and verbs could have been expanded on.  She also tends to look at a sentence on a micro scale, which particular word is wrong or which particular sentence is right or wrong.  I was hoping for at least some attempt at a macro approach towards sentence structure. <br /> <br />She also delves into punctuation, which is great for reference.  She, however, then delves into cliches and e-mail problems.  These two chapters sort of felt added on and really didn't teach me much. <br /> <br />All in all, it's decent.  It's full of good information, and for what it's about, it's pretty reasonable to read from cover to cover.	2005-02-18

Well, I'll be the first to admit that I could care less about punctuation.  If the author ever read this review, she'd probably have multiple heart attacks because of my use of punctuation.  In other words, I don't care.  So, why did this book entertain me?  Well, because, I never knew that punctuation was really that important.    Though some of the humor is not that humurous, Truss gives us a unique, eye-opening, and amusing view of someone who is a hardcore punctuation stickler.  She fully admits her obsessiveness and presents her point of view in an interesting way.  She points out common errors in the present day, in her own life, and in history.  For a subject this dry, she more than makes up for it with her fluid writing style.    Not only does she explain common problems, she also gives rules and usages for all types of punctation.  It is very interesting and informative.  However, much of it was simplified, so it can't really be used as reference book.    All in all, everyone should read it.  No, it didn't change my life, but it does make me pause and consider the proper use of punctuation.  It does lift away the fog of mystery that surrounds colons, semi-colons, parantheses, etc.  If a book makes you look at reading the written word a little differently, then it's done it's job.	2005-02-18

My dad use to work for Ford in the late seventies, so he bought Fords well into the early eighties.  So, as a kid growing up the eighties, all I saw was my dad trying to fix the Fords in the late eighties.  I actually thought that a car breaking down every few months was actually normal.  Needless to say, I own a Toyota now.  So this book intrigued me.  How could a company that my father was proud of revive itself to something that I might consider purchasing a product from? <br /> <br />Well, this book describes Bill Ford's life and the life of the Ford Motor company.  To address the negatives first, while mostly honest, he tends to overestimate how bad things have gotten in the nineties while and overestimates how good Ford is in the present day and in the not so recent past.  He gives the impression that Ford's quality issues and their financial problems were recent problems that are totally resolved.  He makes Bill Ford look like a super genius who fixed everything in his first few year. <br /> <br />Now to point out the good.  This book is part history lesson, part biography, part financial, part business book all mixed into one.  Magee actually goes into depth with not just mere anecdotes and Bill Ford's life story, but gets into numbers and processes.  He talks about management styles, he talks about strategies.  He delves into design and the competition.  More importantly, he brings a lot of relevant and pertinent information in a fluid, quick manner that doesn't bog down the reader. <br /> <br />I will definitely read more books from this author, and for anyone interested in the automotive industry, or anyone interested in large corporations, this book is a must read.	2005-01-14

Living in California, I  sense the extreme hypocrisy amongst many of the state's residents.  This is a state with a large population from out of state yet has a tendency to be isolationist at times.  A place that votes largely liberal, yet only a few years ago passed the extremely controversial and conservative Prop. 187.  A place that is expensive to live, yet relies on low-paid  illegal immigrants to shoulder much of the low end jobs.  This is what Boyle brings out in this book; a book about two simple couples living on the outskirts of Los Angeles. <br /> <br />Boyle describes a typical yuppie upper-middle class couple who moved to the outskirts to avoid urban living.  The typical \\"White Flight\\" family.  He describes an incident where the man from this couple runs his car into the an illegal immigrant, his exact counterpart.  While the white couple has everything and lives a very posh yet uneventful live, the illegal immigrant and his wife exist on the opposite end of the spectrum, living in extreme poverty and hardship.  Boyle does a wonderful job of splicing those two different ways of life together to further show the economic and class divide without explicit political pandering.  He also manages to show the transformation of well off individual who is open minded to a man who is borderline racist. <br /> <br />While good, the main problem is that the two extremes are overdone.  Without going into details, the hardships on the illegal immigrant couple are so increasingly sad and horrendous that it borders on ridiculous and moves to the realm unbelievable.  On the other end of the spectrum, the white couple's \\"problems\\" are so vain that reading about them is pure drudgery at times.  For example, he goes into much detail, pages and pages, about a wall being built.  If he toned down the dullness on one end, and the horrors on the other, the credibility and believability would become vastly apparent. <br /> <br />All in all it's a decent book, but could have beenmuch better.	2005-01-14

This was my first Christopher Moore book, and may be my last.  This book started off good enough, I liked the people, their situation, and the interactions between each one.  It started off as a good, somewhat humorous tale about whaling research.  Funny, amusing - pretty much what I hoped for. <br /> <br />Then all of sudden, the plot went out there.  The second half of the book was a giant, \\"what the heck is this?\\".  From whaling research in Hawaii, it switches to a story about whale boy hybrids, giant Goos controlling the seas,  and Amelia Earhart.  It just was too out there to be interesting or funny.	2004-12-20

Phil Jackson decided to go against convention and publish his journal despite the fact that it betrays his players and the Lakers.  Sounds juicy, right?  Well, not really.  This is not a book about the players, not about basketball strategy, it's just a journal.  Pretty much it.  Even though the motivation for writing this book is deceitful and slimy, it's probably it's main selling point. <br /> <br />It's worth noting that press gives the impression that it's all about Kobe and Shaq.  That is far from the truth.  It's about Phil Jackson in his last season with the Lakers.  He talks about the team, the management, the games, the travel, etc.  Kobe and Shaq are in there, but they don't dominate like it appears they would. <br /> <br />I was disappointed in it for a couple of reasons.  First off, the book is journal, so it's day by day account with a few anecdotal stories. Topics are just glanced over on random pages.  There is no hard hitting facts about one person, nor deep seated basketball strategy.  No real depth at all.  On one page, he'll describe a conversation with Kobe, then talk about traveling to a different city, then in the next page he'll talk about his girlfriend.  Also, he really doesn't say anything new.  He explains that Shaq and Kobe have animosity towards one another.  No, really?  Shaq has free throw problems.  Shocking!  Gary Payton had trouble adjusting to the Triangle Offense.  I would have never guessed!  Lakers aren't really motivated in the regular season.  You're kidding?   A chapter devoted to each of his topics would have brought structure, depth, and a lot more substance.  Phil just grazes some of the most important topics (though he does do a fine job explaining his relationship with Bryant). <br /> <br />The good part is that the book is quick and fluid.  It's also interesting to hear Phil Jackson confirm most of the rumors about the Lakers.  He does go into relationships with his players, particularly Kobe, along with management, and his coaches.  His views on referees and his perspective on management are interesting and deserve to be highlighted as well.  Some interesting stuff that was quite educational, especially near the end. <br /> <br />All in all, even though interesting, Phil Jackson doesn't produce anything close to  the hype surrounding this book.  Wait till paperback or borrow it from a friend.	2004-11-19

If you were to write a book about a 400 page book on the Riemann Hypothesis, about what page would you describe why that particular problem is important?  Page 5, 10?  Well, Derbeyshire weaves in and out of tangents and refuses to get to the point until after 320 pages.  While it is obvious he knows what he's talking about, the author does not move to a single point. <br /> <br />He alternates between the history and the mathematics of the Riemann hypothesis chapter by chapter.  The history is fun and interesting, but it was hard to see what he was talking about because he never seemed to explain the title of the book, \\"Prime obsession:  Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics\\".  Why is the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics?  Why is it called Prime obsession when on the surface it looks the formula has nothing to do with prime numbers?  He only tells you near the end, giving no context to most of the book. <br /> <br />He utterly fails at the mathematics part.  For example, he'll start to get somewhere, but will end up with phrase, \\"let's first look at...\\".  And he'll explain in annoying detail the most basic, ninth grade mathematics instead of finishing his initial thought.  For example, he is about to explain the Zeta function and it seems like he is about to tell you about it, but then suddenly bores you with power rules.  You know, the stuff you learned eighth grade.  a to X times a to the Y equals a to the (X + Y).  He'll bore you with this stuff.  This would be fine, if he prefaced every chapter with \\"if you know this, then skip to...\\", but he doesn't, so you're stuck sifting through the most basic information to get what you need.  Truly annoying. <br /> <br />If you do decide to read this (I hope you don't), and have actually completed high school and some college mathematics, then you should skip all odd chapters, with the following exceptions (pages 43-47, 75-81, 100-105, 216-218, 233-237, 302-310, 327-349).  There you go,I saved you immense time and effort.  Does this mean that nearly half the book is useless?  Yes, useless and tedious.	2004-11-08

Lahiri writes some amazingly well written short stories documenting short periods of angst or troubles for a select few.  In a matter of a few pages, she expertly and discretely develops a character. <br /> <br />There are many great things about these stories.  First off, though she talks about Indian and Indian American experiences, she successfully avoids the generic traps that have haunted Indian/Western literature and cinema.  She doesn't delve into the tired cliché of how a western Indian can balance traditional and western norms, but instead concentrates on the personal and human conflicts that are universal to all.  She pays particular attention to young married couples and relationships. <br /> <br />The only problem I had with this book is that it's too well written for a depressing set of short stories.  What I mean is that most of the stories are realistic, depressing and convincing at that.  Many stories are so realistic that they somehow hit close to home.  Near the end I was dreading reading the stories because I knew something would happen to the main characters (spoiler - near the end, there is at least happy ending). <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great book for fans of literature.	2004-10-07

The last two current Dune trilogies are much more beach novels than the hardcore philosophical based science fiction of Frank Herbert's Dune.  This is fine by me, and I think once you can get over it and accept it for something completely different, then you can enjoy it (note - I understand people who can't read it - I love Asimov's Foundation series, but I can't stand the prequels).    So, assuming that you've read the other two novels in the Butlerian Jihad series, then you'll get what you expected out of this finale. <br /> <br />First off, the main problem is the structure of the book.  Each chapter is something like four pages and each one deals with a different subplot.  Fine - except for the fact that the story will be built up, then you won't hear anything about that story for another thirty pages.  By the time you get back to that part of story, you really don't care anymore. <br /> <br />This is made worse by the fact that pages 250-500 are really dull as you have to wait for the inevitable conclusion by dealing with random people or plots that you really can't care about. <br /> <br />The book suffers from some horrible structure and waiting that just makes it a pain to read. <br /> <br />There are also some problems with whole Robots torturing people or arguing with each other, along with other things that just make no sense. <br /> <br />Now for the good stuff (skip this paragraph if you want to avoid possible spoilers).  You get the final battles that you wanted.  You get to see the beginning of Atriedes - Harkonnen feud.  You get the first Space Guild Navigator.  You get to witness the start of Bene Gesserit.  You get to see that start of the Suk doctors.  You get the beginning of the Corrino dynasty.  You get to see the first Mentat.  All in all, this is what I wanted all along.  You've heard about these topics from the original Dune novels, and it's really satisfying to know the origins.  I guess the only problem I had with it was that everything was wrapped up too conveniently. <br /> <br />Also, the writing style of the authors is fluid and interesting, and if they could have just structured it better, would have made for a book that would have been impossible to put down. <br /> <br />So, if you want to know more about the Dune elements and don't have the \\"this is not Frank Herbert\\" hang ups, this is your book.	2004-09-29

It describes a broken detective named Carol Starkey and how she works on a case to find a national bomber.<br /><br />Without going into details, it's a fun, fast paced book with a smart plot.  Crais successfully weaves characters into a single case involving a mysterious and intelligent bomber.  The main character, Starkey is a fallible officer who has to battle more than a few problems along with the bomber case, and is shown to be both smart, dumb, rigid, uncaring, and determined.  For a typical supermarket thriller, she is surprisingly complex.<br /><br />The only unfortunate thing about this book is that Crais ends it with a predictable and cliched ending that just makes you shake your head.<br /><br />All in all, it's just a good read.	2004-09-27

Though taking pop culture references and tying those to societal behavior is nothing new, Klosterman sometimes intelligently places real and intense thoughts about subjects that weren't meant to be dissected socially.  He goes into how the Sims, Saved by the Bell, the 80s Lakers-Celtics rivalry all represent or influence society in one form or another.  This book contains 18 disjointed, unrelated chapters explaining Klosterman's view of random popular culture phenomenons.    The good part about this book is that at some points it's smart and hilarious at the same time.  Klosterman's view on Soccer and why neither he nor America will ever accept is worth the price of the book alone.  The first half of the book is far superior in that you'll find yourself laughing at loud (like I did on a plane).  If you had part of your life influenced by random and useless things like toys or television shows when you were a kid, then this sort of sheds light on how minute items can influence anyone.    There are two bad parts about this book though.  Since he devotes a chapter to a random idea based on an aspect of culture, you'd be somewhat interested in that aspect.  He went on a giant tirade about how classical country music is better than modern Nashville country music.  Not only did I not care about that genre of music, I was unaware of the division of classical and modern country, nor did I really want to know about such a division.  The worst part of this book is that he does a lot of useless explaining of random facts in detail that really aren't intriguing, funny or interesting, and doesn't incorporate these long winded details to anything noteworthy.  In the chapter where he describes religious fanatics, he gives a boring and long summary of a religious movie for almost no reason.  The second half of the book is really chalked full of such useless information and provides nothing interesting, funny or thought provoking at all.    By the way, there is hardly any mention of Sex, Drugs, or even Cocoa Puffs in this book.    All in all, it's interesting and unique, but the latter chapters were so dull that it left a dull taste in my mouth.  There were some great chapters, but the inconsistency just makes it an average book at best.	2004-09-27

A cop, who is haunted by a botched hostage negotiation leaves the force to work in a small town only to be dragged back into a hostage negotiation.  That is what this whole book is about. <br /> <br />It starts out well enough, with a few criminals going into a house and holding the family as hostage in order to beat out a murder charge.  While not a bad novel, the sentence structure and fluidity tend to be terse and sometimes out of place.  Crais also starts adding random complications that sort of pull the book away from the unlikely but possible to the almost absurd. <br /> <br />It's a decent book, but Crais has done so much better.	2004-08-26

While not a superb novel, there is really nothing wrong with it.  Sometimes drags a bit, sometimes exciting, it's a good book nonetheless. <br /> <br />Basically, a young girl enters Elvis's office and asks him to find her father.  What happens is a typical hairy situation with a lot of twists and turns.  Though it is quite unrealistic at the end, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to continue reading about Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike.	2004-08-20

Elvis's goal is to find the child, all the while working with tight lipped partner, the LA cops, his girlfriend's ex husband, and many other goons and low-lifes. <br /> <br />While not a literary masterpiece, this book is a fun page turner.  The action and fluidity is constant, the plot is well conceived, and the stand-offs between Elvis and everyone else keeps things interesting.  Though the plot is pretty standard, the unraveling of the plot is magnificent.  Crais could have turned the book into a sappy kid story, but instead concentrated on the kidnapping hunt. <br /> <br />This is a great page turning read.  One of those books where before you know, you've reached the end.	2004-08-08

In his latter law books, Grisham tends to ignore this in order to bring some sentimental or over the top cliched plot along.  When he avoids this, however, is when his writing really shines. <br /> <br />Bleachers has nothing to do with law, but it is about an old faded Quarterback returning for the funeral of a beloved, well respected, yet somewhat unknown small town football coaching celebrity.  The coach, who is dead before the book really begins, and the town itself, are the real stars of this novel.  People of different generations and different ideals come together to honor a man who epitomized this small town and it's extreme love of football.  Throughout the Quarterback's visit, we see varying states of nostalgia, remorse, joy, regret about the town as a whole and many of its characters.  We also uncover the details of the coach's history, troubles, low points and high points.  <br /> <br />Grisham truly does an admiral job portraying a small Texas town in just a few days.  He expertly weaves a funeral of one man into an all-encompassing, yet compassionate and believable, story that ranks up there with his best works.  Grisham will bring you to small town Texas, and at many points, you won't be able to put it down.	2004-08-07

This book has the feel of two different novels pasted together.  The first half is very intriguing, where Elvis has to search for a Television star's biological parents.  Elvis searches Louisiana and comes up with even more mysteries and secrets, making it interesting and a page turner.  I almost felt the anxiety and the hot muggy air when I read the first half. <br /> <br />Then, all of a sudden, a horrible travesty of a book breaks out.  Suddenly, Elvis somehow becomes involved in multi mob-boss fighting and immigration issues involving government stings, racial tensions from long ago, and horribly over-sentimental goals.  The fluidity of the book is lost.  The motivations and character involvement's are convoluted at best.  Compared to the first half of the book, the second half is pure garbage. <br /> <br />Crais took a good book and sabotaged it.	2004-08-07

Hope is gone until he learns that he can tame the tiger and hopefully survive long enough to reach land.  Without getting into much detail and spoiling the story, his journey is harrowing, scary, inventive, sometimes disgusting, but thoroughly captivating. <br /> <br />This would make it a good book, but the ending provides a fascinating twist that requires the reader to re-think all the events in the novel, making it great.  The preface (which I read last, as you should probably do as well), explains how this novel came about which is almost as interesting as the novel itself. <br /> <br />All in all, a great, thought provoking, inspiring novel.	2004-08-06

This book says it's a study guide for the Linux+ certification.  Well, yes and no.  It does explain the concepts of Linux, it does give a brief description of the test and has a CD that contains two sample tests.  However, that's where the study guide ends.  It's really a beginner's guide to Linux as opposed to a study guide.<br />This book is very verbose in that it uses a lots of paragraphs as opposed to tables, lists, and definition.  It's a good thorough read, but a terrible, terrible reference book.  Designed for the absolute beginner, it's not for people who played with Linux and are trying to get certified.  The first half of the book is extremely basic where it takes about 10 minutes of reading for anything particular concept to become apparent.  The latter half is more advanced and informative, but without simple tables and references, much of the information is lost in the needless rambling.<br />The worst parts are the review sections.  The summaries at the end of the chapter are really lacking.  So while concepts are explained well, the details (e.g. where are the system logs, how to alter the init level scripts) are hidden within chapters.<br />The practice tests are good, but the difficulty between the end of chapter tests and the practice tests are huge.<br />A study guide needs to be full of facts, easily searchable, concise, and contain a lot of information.  This book only fulfills the latter requirement.	2004-07-19

Is there financial analysis that can lead to increasing market gains?  Is it all random?  If it is random, why is everyone trying to beat the system and get better returns?  If there are inefficiencies, why haven't they haven't been exploited yet?<br />He goes into such topics as the psychology of losses, the analysis of risk, the diversification of portfolios, and how it all relates to strategies, probabilities, and many mathematical topics.  He often interjects how he went against common mathematical theories by personally sticking with his WorldCom stock during it's huge crash.<br />It's hard to explain or give a synopsis of this book because it really doesn't have a concrete point, nor does it really have anything that really stands out.  It's a bunch of somewhat interesting mathematical concepts that either loosely or strongly correlate to the stock market.<br />All in all, it's a decent easy read, but nothing eye-opening or memorable.	2004-06-15

Despite the blatant fear mongering title, this book actually uses sound reasoning, statistics and facts to prove a point that houses are overvalued.  <br />Talbott gets into the increasing housing costs for individuals, especially the recent spike that economically doesn't make sense.  He goes through the range of reasons, from the low interest rates, the stock market abandonment, to the increasing amounts of leverage.  He then explains how those prices are out of range historically.  <br />The most impressive and eye opening part was the thorough and precise explanation of the inefficiency of the housing market.  He goes through the irrationality of the current home owners, mortgage insurance companies, the bankruptcy system, and tells how the structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac encourages increasingly risky and extended loans while shutting out healthy competition.<br />The only disappointment was the fact that I was not convinced of a crash.  He did an excellent job of showing the overpriced market, but gave no reason why a correction would be sudden or dramatic, as opposed to a gradual leveling off in a few years.<br />All in all, it's an informative and worthwhile read.	2004-06-15

Kezner describes not only the overthrow concocted by CIA, but the previous events of early Iranian history, British colonialism, corrupt oil deals, and the future ramifications of the overthrow.<br />This book is a very concise history book.  Out of the 200 pages, only about fifty concern the actual overthrow.  It's much less a description of the overthrow than a sociological and psychological description and analysis of how the revolution occurred and whether it was a viable option to combat communism, or just an excuse to exploit a small country.  <br />All in all, it's a very concise, informative, insightful read which strangely mirrors many of today's current events.  I highly recommend this.	2004-06-01

Since I didn't read any reviews previously, and the cover never mentioned it's &quot;fun&quot; nature, I was in for a horrible does of stupidity as I expected a serious horror book.  It's basically a giant chase scene that gradually becomes so absurd and random that I can't see how anyone could enjoy it.<br />The book starts off simply enough, with Chucky type rag doll attacking and chasing the main character, Tommy.  Though somewhat off the wall, I've seen much worse.  However, Tommy runs into a waitress during the chase, and they both start avoiding the doll.  This is where it goes rapidly downhill.  What starts with a simple hunt by the doll ends up some with weird stuff like alien dogs supplying supernatural powers, communicating to the dead through a radio, and old Vietnamese curses producing ghosts that can't enter a house, but can kill indiscriminately.<br />Just plain dumb.

In fact, it's basically a description of the author meeting a few people and talking about a few things, all loosely based on the fact that high culture and low brow have merged into one.<br />What I expected was the convergence of such two different types of cultures to be explained in a thought provoking, interesting manner.  A smart sociological conscience book.  Instead, I basically got John Seabrook's random and pointless observations.  He describes the change not by numbers, graphs, professional opinions, numerous sources, but instead just merely points a few random examples, like his closet, the movement of his office from one building to another, how he met a kid guitarist.  Absolutely nothing eye opening, noteworthy, interesting, or concrete.   <br />This is the equivalent of me talking about the culture and history of Hawaii by showing slides of my vacation.

It is definitely typical of later Grisham.  Predictable, short, but readable.  <br />Grisham describes the life of a young man who moves to the south and buys a small county newspaper.  The first part deals with a trial of a gruesome murder.  The second part deals with a mysterious killer (though who the real killer is insultingly obvious).  Along with it, Grisham uses this story to weave in other stories about racial integration,  southern style, and families.<br />There is nothing wrong with this book except for the fact that it tries to be all in one and doesn't go into any great depth.  Is it a thriller, a social commentary piece, or a law book?  It tries to be all three and the result is very ho hum.<br />Definitely better than \\"The Street Lawyer\\" or \\"King of Torts\\".  Doesn't reach the heights of \\"The Chamber\\" or \\"A Painted House.\\"<br />It's a decent read, but very mundane.	2004-02-25

In this book, Lawrence Taylor goes into his life of drugs, fast cars, lots of woman, and tons of money.  He describes his life, but with not so much detail.  In fact, a chunck of his book are actually quotes from other people intermingled within his text.  The book is about 250 pages long with a large font.  I bought so it would last me a while, but I started reading it at noon, and finished it before dinner.<br />The third person quotes are what really got to me.  A portion of the quotes are self promoting, and other quotes just repeat what LT described in the previous paragraph.  They hardly provided any insight into LT, but ruined the flow and continuity of the book in general.<br />The lack of detail is also apparent.  There are many references to how fast he was and how he revolutionized the game, but he provides no expansion of this.  No information on how fast he ran, or how much he can bench press, or what types of plays he helped revolutionize.  In terms of a football book, it's virtually non-existent.  He doesn't go into much detail on other parts of the books as well.  He describes a lot of parties, bar hopping, fast driving, and throws a few general stories in there, but with only a few exception, nothing specific to hold on to.<br />Another bad part of this book is that in the end, he tries to evoke sympathy to which no one really can't.<BR>This brings it back to his life story.  The most admirable aspect of the book is that he is very honest with himself.  He knew cocaine destroyed him, and sometimes goes into some depressing stories.  He knew he was lazy sometimes, but he still played hard.<br />All in all, it's short, but extremely readable.  It's more of an outline than a full fledged expose, but it's honest and somewhat shocking nonetheless.	2004-02-02

He doesn't subscribe to conventional wisdom of beginning, climax, conclusion, etc.  He concentrates on characters, issues and dialogue.  This book, however, didn't seem to satisfy me.  Though this novel is short, he delves into a serious subject of whether artists are responsible for society, themselves, or art itself.<br />Roth describes how Nathan Zuckerman, a promising new author, meets and stays with one of his idols in American literature.  The conversation seems to lag, and gets to the point in a roundabout and unreal way.  Roth then presents a flashback of how Zuckerman had to sacrifice his family relationship for the sake of publishing one story concerning his family and Jewish heritage.  Then things took  a turn for the worse, when Roth incorporates a wild personal narrative of Anne Frank surviving the holocaust, while refusing to reveal herself.<br />It is intriguing look into responsibility of an artist, but it's way of presenting the issues is almost laughable.  While I admire Roth and especially the Human Stain, I can't say I found this one up to par.	2004-02-02

Roth writes a sort of superfluous, wordy way to get the plot moving.  While at first it seems like an attempt to fill pages with useless descriptions, it's actually an in-depth portrayal into a person's history, their characteristics, and their mental state.<br />Roth describes the life of Coleman Silk, a college dean who was forced to resign because he used the word \\"Spooks\\", a word though normally harmless but could be construed as a racial slur.  Through the eyes of a friend and author, Silk starts a relationship with a broken down woman half his age after this incident.  What this amounts to is an interesting dichotomy between the two lovers.  Later, through Roth's insights, there characteristics and psyche are portrayed more similar than different.  The way Roth describes and unfolds this relationship is a great joy.<br />Roth, unfortunately, delves in Coleman Silk's past life too much at what amounts to a typical oppressed person, black and white story.  For about one third of the Book, Coleman Silk's past is described in what is nothing more than a boring epilogue.<br />There is also the story of a the woman's ex husband.  Even though it is pretty obvious and self evident overall as he is an enraged Vietnam Veteran, the part where he has to venture into a Chinese restaurant and overcome his hatred for East Asians is both intense and impressive.<br />While the characteristics are sometimes gripping, there are without a doubt unreal.  I can't imagine some of the characters in this book, especially the young French professor, to be taken seriously.<br />Not a typical plot driven novel, this book is well worth the read though.	2004-01-16

He delves into what people thought were the magical panacea's to growth, first machine investment, then education, then infrastructure, then aid, then debt relief, and so on.  He then refutes each and every one of the suggested solutions.<br />Easterly worked at the World Bank, so he knows what he's talking about.  Even though not biting or cynical, he doesn't sugar coat anything.  His first few chapters are dry and repetitive in the way that he explains how investing alone will not allow poorer countries to catch up.   The following chapters do tend to flow better, though the repetitiveness still remains.   It felt like he was switching back and forth, writing to a general audience on some chapters, writing like a educational thesis on a few chapters.  Sometimes he'd make a convincing argument to something, but the actual point won't come until much later.<br />Easterly, takes all the myths that most economists believed, and squashes them.  Even though he uses anecdotal evidence, he backs up all his points with solid statistics, giving much credibility.  It is clearly evident that Easterly has taken fifty years of attempted economic growth incentives, and explained what went wrong in a concise manner.<br />To me, there were some glaring omissions.  He never explains why a few countries' economies actually did catch up.  He also doesn't bring cultural aspects into the realm.  He doesn't refute or accept work ethic differences.  Is a country's historical and cultural identity and work ethic influential to it's growth?  That is a question that I would have loved to find out.<br />To those who take interest in these types of economic quandaries, this book is right up your alley.  Not altogether readable, it is very informative and well researched.	2004-01-07

The author's language is fluid and readable, not like a boring, stuffy textbook.  He discusses everything from trade, inflation, fed rates, and the role of government.  Sometimes informative, this book assumes hardly any economic knowledge from the reader, so it's really a beginner's book to economics.  Anyone who took a simple economics course would probably not need to read big chunks of this.<br />Even though simplistic, it is a quick and fun read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor.

The name is sort of a misnomer though.  It should be called \\"Media of Fear\\".  Nonetheless, it reinforces what I've felt all along, that the media and news are not out to report what's informative and worthy, but what is sexy - and that is fear.  Even though this was written before 9/11, this is even more poignant now.<br />Glassner explains how the media ignores statistics and common sense in order to fill the airwaves and the printed word with scare tactics.  He explains how the media, influenced by political groups and human interest stories, ignore the big picture and focus on anecdotal evidence in order to sell their fear.   He provides many examples of this, from airplane crashes to vaccines, and explains how these unfounded fears come about.  He carefully uses both concrete evidence and statistics to prove the media wrong, and explains why and how the media choose to report the way they do.<br />Unfortunately, for people like me who already agree with him, it doesn't provide much new information.  Also, when he talks of the media, he talks of the supply side.  He rarely mentions the demand side.  Why is such media is actually being watched, and why are consumers falling for this, hook, line, and sinker?<br />Finally, the writing style is not altogether fluid.  It's hard to describe, but it's not a real page turner.<br />All in all, it's a good book.  It'll either confirm what you already know, or be an eye opener.	2003-11-29

John Gardner depicts Grendel and not the epitome of evil, but a complicated creature that is both humanistic and animal with both internal and external struggles.  He takes a simple creature from a classic piece of literature and adds depth and substance.<br />What I didn't enjoy was Gardner's writing style.  He uses perhaps the most annoying literary device ever conceived.  In order to reflect a character's unfocused views, he writes in an unfocused haphazard manor.  The exact same thing that made Ford Maddux Ford's, \\"A Good Soldier\\", and any James Joyce novel practically unreadable.  <br />This book is a short story about Grendel's interaction with man, observing all along, sometimes wanting to be included, sometimes disgusted with them.  He is intrigued by their wars, violence, relationships, there Gods, their music, and many of the people.  He switches from a primal beast to a philosophical man in a figurative sense.  He interacts with his mother, human singers, human hunters, and even a dragon to counteract the lesser human comparative aspect.  This helps shape his deep, yet somewhat different points of view.<br />Unfortunately, if told in a straightforward story, this would be interesting, fun, and thought provoking.  Instead, Gardner mixes normal first person narrative with incongruous poetry all sprinkled with random philosophical ramblings all with an non-fluid sentence structure, causing any reader to re-read many confusing pages.<br />I would pass on this book.  The idea is interesting, but this book is no page turner, as the execution is terrible.	2003-11-29

I was one of those that really enjoyed the first prequel of the original series but was disappointed with the second book of the original prequel series.  This book, the second book of the Butlerian Jihad, is slightly disappointing, but the latter half of the book is where it shines.<br />The first 400 pages, nothing happens.  Nope, nothing, nada.  Every other page either paraphrases the Eramus killing Serena's baby, and the other page describes how people react to the killing of the baby.  By page 200, I almost gave up.  The only reason why I continued was that I've read all the other Dune books, and I just couldn't stop.  It was beyond tedious, beyond repetitive.  I guess they got paid by the page or something.<br />Only at about page 400 (it's a 700-page book) does the action pick up.  Fortunately, the plot moves swiftly and in interesting directions.  This is where I regained my interest, and I now look forward to third book.  Without giving too much away, there are battles, a few surprises, interesting action, great plot twists, and some character changes.<br />Unfortunately, the only thing that spoiled the last 300 pages was the fact that almost everyone or everything was black and white, either unbelievably great, or truly evil.  This is lack of depth was almost insulting.<br />All in all, it was decent.  With proper editing, it could have been as good as the first book of the series.	2003-11-15

This book is less of a sociological study but more of a rant.  While some points are valid, I could not help but think the authors just have grudges against certain things.  In the latter half of this book, statistics, surveys and valid studies dominate, making it informative, but the beginning is littered with gripes and anecdotal evidence which I feel hurts the credibility of the whole book.<br />The books deals with how American society is on a consuming rampage that is controlling our lives.  Somehow, though, they concentrate of  the extremes, insert wild exaggerations, and seem oblivious to the fact that the two major factors that take away the most money are taxes and housing.  What little meaning they attach to a house is meaningless rants again McMansions, and somehow support the hypocrisy of cheaper housing and more open space.<br />Yes, they bring up some valid points.  The environmental information they provide is excellent and an eye-opener.  The advertising section was also informative and made think a little harder.<br />All in all, it's good, but in the end it made me that the only way to satisfy the authors of this book would be for everyone to go back in time and become Yeoman farmers, in a magical world where land is cheap and plentiful and government is an efficient system that can solve all of societies woes.  It ain't going to happen.	2003-09-28

While informative, she tends to ignore problems of housing, education, and taxes and concentrates on single or couples and there problems.<br />This book is very good in that she does her research and she does it well.  Unlike the book, \\"Affluenza\\", she doesn't resort to deriding people, but instead gives informed and statistically valid opinions.  She tends to know who to place the blame on, the consumer's themselves.<br />She describes an accurate portrayal of \\"keeping up the Jones\\", and how that is now a skewed view in which results in a constant race against debt and time.  She also goes into shopping therapy and the sub-conscious need for status and style.  <br />All in all, it works for some people.  This is great knowledge for empty-nesters or people living in cheaper parts of the country with no family.  Most of the information is useless to families, as expensive clothes and new cars probably pale in comparison to housing costs.  To me, that makes this book incomplete, and the title misleading, as her \\"solutions\\" don't even address the average American family.	2003-09-28
US	49194495	R1OQKHPSCDNKMD	0679602860	655554658	Don Quixote de La Mancha (Modern Library)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A tale of insanity at it's finest.	Don Quixote is a classic piece of literature.  If someone could produce a more up to date, vernacular translation, it would rival any comedy made today.  This is a story about one man caught up in so many chivalry books that he becomes insane and starts traveling through Spain acting as a heroic knight while fighting made up villains and monsters.  By his side is his gullible yet loyal servant Sancho.<br />It's nice to know that during the Renaissance period such humor existed.  The first part of the book deals with him traveling throughout and mixing up inns for castles, random people as kings or knights, and a random woman as his unrequited love for which all of the world must know.  It's a tragic comedy where one man's insanity and futility provide worry for a few, concern for others, and great entertainment for most of the characters.<br />What's interesting is the \\"twist\\" in the middle that leads to the second part, where after one man wrote a book about Don Quixote's wild adventures, a rich family, upon seeing the actual man who was in the book, decide to play along in probably the cruelest hoax in history.  Claiming there Duke and Duchess, and promising the most absurd things.  One of which was giving Sancho an actual province to rule over.<br />The one thing that irked me about this book was that even though it needs to be translated for English readers, no translator has yet made the book as fluid or readable as it deserves to be.<br />All in all, it's a good book, but hopefully a general author, and not some stuffy scholar, could translate it what it should be - a really funny and tragic story.	2003-09-28

This small, expensive book provided little new knowledge on this subject.<br />He goes into details that don't really shed much light on the subject.  He spends a significant portion of the book describing the origins of High Fructose Corn Syrup.  While interesting, the history is pretty much irrelevant now that it's already here.  He spends another chunk of this book describing government studies and then criticizing them.  Of course, does the American really base their decisions on the studies mentioned - I don't think so.<br />The rest of his depiction of Fat America just concentrates on the supply side of calories.  He really doesn't delve into the personal choices that affects one's eating.  <br />Basically, this book is small, but that's just means there is really no new information in there.  Just read Fast Food Nation, and you'll get a lot more than this.	2003-09-28

This time, however, he splices this shorter book into three different, partially related topics.  One is about marijuana, the other is about migrant farm workers, and the last part is about the porn industry.<br />All three sections explain the history, the social injustices, and the current state of those particular topics.  With three different section, Schlosser fails to go in depth into some of the major issues.  While not a flaw in itself, sometimes the information could have been more statistical or insightful.<br />The first section is the best.  He describes the continuing and perhaps fruitless effort of America's political system to stop the spread of weed.  Though mostly anecdotal, he does open eyes to the unequal and baffling judicial and legislative steps to stop this so called problem.<br />The second part of the book mainly concerns migrant strawberry workers from Mexico.  Though informative,  I think he fails to reveal why such a system continues to thrive.  While describing their living conditions, there is little mention of  the Not in my Backyard movement,, and no mention of California's proposition 13.  When he discusses there working conditions, he fails to fully explain the proposed guest worker program, nor does he provide statistics that could shed some more light on the subject.<br />The last part, about the porn industry, is terrible.  While most of the book is dedicated to high level issues and concerns, he basis this story on a porn distributor's legal dilemma in painfully boring detail.  It seems like Schlosser really was obsessed with someone who wasn't that interesting.  Schlosser goes into agonizing details - like literally giving the life story of the guy who eventually examined the porn distributor's taxes.<br />This book is a quick read, but this leaves the impression of quick book of unrelated information tied together in order to capitalize on the buzz of the author's previous book.	2003-08-16

I thought that this would deal with more the generalized view of Wall Street.   However, it really concentrates on the lives of traders.<br />Lewis does shed some light on Wall Street trading in general, including a good description of mortgage trading and junk bond trading.  However, this book sort of throws it into the mix.  I wasn't sure what Lewis was trying to do.  Sometimes it felt like a history book, sometimes a biography, sometimes an economics lesson, sometimes a comedy.  It felt haphazard and lacked direction, and with the writing style presented, it lacked a certain amount of fluidity.<br />It was fun to learn the different people in Wall Street.  From the obese, abusive traders,  the short sighted and greedy executives, the brown nosers, to the \\"back row\\" trainees.  It's basically a fun little description of office life at Solomon Brothers in the eighties, not an exciting expose on the finance industry as the cover would like you to believe.	2003-08-16

Though I would consider its predecessor slightly better, but this book is definitely worth the time and money for a long book (relative to the previous books in the series).<br />The book sees Harry Potter grow into an even a better magician, not only battling the dark lord, but also gossip, girls, and any other thing a fifteen year old has to deal with.<br />With the exception of the last 150 pages, the book flies by.

I thought it would be an extreme left wing rant about the current state of society.  In some respects, I was right.  At first, I thought, oh no.  The author decided to show a bleak view of society by the amount of fast food restaurants  there are.  He painted a picture of some ideal restaurants being overtaken by huge fast corporations.  Uhm, I lived in a place where many fast food places were pretty much banned, and let me tell you, the food was inconsistent, the service rude, the places unclean, and the menu extremely overpriced.  So, I initially thought this book was going to fall apart.<br />Then the author started to shift away from his sociological gripes and starts detailing the history and workings of fast food.  Intriguing, and fact filled, this section seemed to make up for the his leftist tint.  He chronicled the life of a farmer, a land owner, the major food corporations.  He provided an interesting view of the integration and exploitation between their workings and interactions.  His countless examples of money influencing the politicians also adds to the book.<br />He then moves onto the working conditions of employees at meat packing facilities.  Though relying mostly on just a few examples, he convincingly paints the meat industry as corporate monsters who would sacrifice illegal aliens, towns, and the health of even school children to make an extra buck.<br />Finally, in the afterward, he goes into mad cow disease, with a scary and scathing view of the food industry view on this that will make anyone second guess what they put into there mouth.<br />Unfortunately, he never convinced me that fast food places like McDonalds were bad.  In fact, he sort of compliments Jack in the Box when it comes to food safety.  However, his picture of where meat come from is eye opening and slightly horrifying, and is the real strength of this book.	2003-07-27

To anyone who has wondered why Oakland GM Billy Beane seems to perform miracles, or more importantly, anyone who truly values statistics and logic over Sportscenter highlights, this book is for you.  To anyone who thinks the regular season shows true talent, while the playoffs are a crapshoot, this book is for you.<br />This book chronicles the Oakland A's in three aspects -  Billy Beane's own personal history and style, his scientific and more accurate view on recruiting and trading, and the lives of a few A's players themselves.   He also delves into the history and explanation of Sabrmatrics, the relatively new and better way of looking at baseball statistics.<br />Billy Beane's philosophy is based on high base percentage, good pitching statistics, and disregards speed, power, arm-strength, or any other characteristic that the typical recruits look for.  While other teams only concentrates on potential and tools, Billy exploits this inefficiency and year after years constructs a great baseball team.  Instead of game, he approaches it as if it was market, and reacts accordingly.  Lewis does a great job expanding on this and paints Billy Beane as a man who can think outside the box.<br />The most intriguing part is when Lewis chronicles the A's draft.   He follows them through this ordeal, and details the strategy of drafting and signing those players.<br />After reading this quick book, I can now say I'm Billy Beane fan.  I  cannot help but respect Billy Beane and the other statisticians that have revolutionized baseball.  With all the insight and thought presented, it has helped me appreciate baseball as truly the greatest sport of them all.	2003-07-27

Work on your business, instead of working for your business.  Plan and organize as if the business was a franchise prototype, to be run by anyone.  He talks about strategies, from organization, to managerial, to systems.  He emphasizes long term and precise planning.  He emphasizes research and separate task appropriation.  All good ideas that should be implemented, but nothing revolutionary or nothing that doesn't include good common sense.<br />However, realizing that he can't sell a pamphlet, he decides to write a book with wishy washy philosophical nonsense accompanied with dialogue between him and a supposed entrepreneurial.  Since he uses exact quotes, and the language style of the entrepreneurial is exactly the same as his own, it's got to be fake.  Almost insultingly so.  I find it hard to believe that he taped and transcribed every meeting with \\"Sarah\\", a women who has an amazing knack of asking the most perfect and opportune questions in the same tone and style as the author. <br />The philosophical rants that he goes on is repetitive, dull, and often unnecessary.  He just goes on and on.

Throughout the book, the neighbors, the townspeople, an escaped convict and are all suspects.<br />While not a large book, the Hound of the Baskervilles does trudge along at some points.  The someone antiquated language aside, it does delve into more detail and much more build up than a typical Holmes' short story does.  So while in a short story, the mystery would be solved in minutes, in this book, the mystery takes a while to come forth.  For example, in the beginning there is a mysterious person in a stagecoach following the heir.  The mystery is only solved at the end, but with all the other events that took place, the reader has already lost interest in that particular person.  I personally forgot about it, thus it did not intrigue me at all.<br />Also, in much of this book, Holmes is not even present.  The wit and mystery are substituted with settings and descriptions instead, not Doyle's strongest points.<br />While a classic mystery which is still good, it can come out as somewhat unsatisfying.	2003-06-25

It chronicles the lives, the company, the gaming industry, and the impact of these two young computer geniuses.  It's a quick, fluid read that is not only entertaining, but is awe inspiring as well.<br />This is a fascinating book on many fronts.  It describes how two kids got into games from the early childhoods, describes their fascination with computers in general, and their dreams.  It goes from a tale of two kids with ideas, to their technological innovations, to business start, to their monumental growth, and finally to their fallout.  It sheds light not only independent game programming, but of the type of people who develop and play these first person shooters like Doom.<br />Not only is this a biography, or a game book, it's also sort of the &quot;startup.com&quot; of the gaming world.  With a good mixture of business, gaming, with unique and individual characters,  it indirectly describes the world of gaming companies and what it takes to make a good, and bad, company.<br />While a good book for all, it's a must for anyone who loves games or is into software development.	2003-05-21

Enron's greed and financial scandals, along with the rise and fall, are interesting in itself.  This book, though it does explain the fall and is easily readable, isn't intriguing enough to capture the reader's attention.  In fact, more than half is a description of how Enron came to be and what there business model is.  A chunk of the book is just photocopied evidence pasted in the appendix.  Only a minute section describes the scandal and accounting frauds.<br />The author loves anologies.  He devotes pages to baseball card trading, and then sort of compares it to Enron's business.  While these analogies help with understanding the business model, it's often over-simplified with a glaring lack of details.  What I found was a lack of hard numbers and statistics which meant I couldn't put the failings into perspective.  Also, the first half of the book where he details Enron, he seems to be praising their business, then hand wavingly, he points to a few corrupted examples.  It almost appears that the author thinks Enron would still be a powerhouse if it wasn't for a few specific incidents.<br />As a book, it gets the job done.  It shows the errors of Enron in a way that any non financial person could understand.  It does tend to oversimplify, and it's glaring lack of numbers and details hurt it in the end.	2003-05-21

Riccardo Orizio decides to find seven of these dictators ,interview them,  find out what they have been up to, and what they feel about there reign.<br />Each dictator takes a chapter, and the readers learns about their past, their feelings, and their own view of themselves, which proves extremely fascinating.  In each chapter, Riccardo details his ordeals on reaching these fallen dictators, a short history of what they did, and what they are currently up to.  Riccardo does a great job of simultaneously making fun of and humanizing these individuals.  He also provides insight into there current lives, from Idi Amin's sons, one of whom played basketball in Boston College, the other being a military terrorist being help by Idi himself, to Slobadon Milosevic's wife, who plays the role of a tortured, loyal wife.<br />I think the main problem of this book is that it is too addictive.  It's a short book, so while I intended to have this book last me a week, I couldn't put in down.  I bought at noon, and I finished before dinner.  One complaint might be that the interviews and background information  are not thorough.  While true, I think that by leaving out the text book information, he was able to immerse the reader with the dictator's lives and provide great fluidity.<br />All in all, it's a great idea that proves too addictive to put down.	2003-05-21

This is one of those books that you read, and after you're finished, you're not sure if you liked it or not.  It wasn't great, but there is nothing really wrong with it.  It wasn't boring, it didn't drag on, but it also didn't captivate you.<br />A detective is working on a case similar to those annoying rich girl missing girl cases that randomly appears everywhere.  This book explores this Scottish case, along with some internal police politics, and the lives of a few detectives.  Intermingling clues concerning dolls, autopsies, and an Internet game all come together to help solve the mystery.<br />As with any mystery, the main part is the ending, and even though not terrible, it is pretty contrived and non-climatic.	2003-05-03

Hit number 29 in fact.  This time it's a bit strange.  He knows the intended victim from childhood, the guy who hired him has a vendetta against him, he's got people following him, and he's not quite sure if the guy deserves what he's getting.<br />The book boils down to whether in the end, the victim gets killed, or Joey gets shafted.  In order to describe how he kills someone, he describes the events leading to, during, and after the job has been done.  While hitting is a great story, the preparation involved, along with the needless and pointless details is not.<br />Joey seems to describe his days at the track, his arguments with his wife, how he hates one guy, how numbers are run.  Seemingly sidetracked, he sometimes forgets he's hitting a guy and describes the tedious day to day movements of his own life.  When he does go back to the hit, the mystery of the victim is fragmented and hardly fluid.  <br />While interesting in the beginning, towards the later half it gets pretty monotonous, as if delaying the ending in order to fill a few more pages.<br />What saves it is that is a true story, and does provide insight to the methodical way a hit is accomplished, along with a description of a life of a New York criminal.	2003-05-02

I use to laugh at the fact that there was a World Series of Poker, and laugh even more because it was televised. After this book, I have to admit I was wrong to do so.<br />In this book, Andy Bellin describes every facet of poker. From how it is played, to where it is played, to whom plays it, and how it is won. He describes his own stories, those of professional poker players and of poker addicts. He details how to win, and how skill and guile are used to make serious money.<br />To anyone who rarely or casually plays poker, this is an eye-opener. For example, he concentrates on Texas Hold Em', which he explains is the only game poker players take seriously. He goes through the history, nomenclature, the way the odds work, and how it takes years and years of practice and money loss in order to succeed. I for one didn't know how much math and observational skill it took to win. I always thought it was mostly luck.<br />So, when I flip to ESPN2, I'll just have to stick to making fun of Soccer and Curling. Any book that can make me respect poker players is a darn good book indeed.	2003-05-02

This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books.  It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television.  As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl.  A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.  <br />However, the book goes downhill from there.  We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government.  Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window.  Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books.  He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking.  The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do.  This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.<br />He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking.  This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.<br />For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you.  While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way.	2003-03-21

John Grisham can weave a great story, but sometimes he just feels like regurgitating the same tired formula.  An underdog, poor lawyer goes through some life changing thing, fights off some highly paid unstoppable law office, struggles a bit, but in the end finds out true happiness.  This book isn't really that different from the rest.  While not as obvious or black and white as The Street Lawyer, it definitely doesn't compare to the Rainmaker, the Chamber, or his non-law books like a Painted House or Skipping Chirstmas.<br />This time the young lawyer is a young district attorney who stumbles onto a case where he meets a mysterious man who leads him into a mass tort litigation.  After leaving his girlfriend of many years, he quickly becomes entangled in the rich mega lawyer lifestyle of mass tort firms.  He changes from a man who cares little about money to a money hungry lawyer who has a trophy wife and plane.<br />Of course, anyone can predict how the whole thing would end, so there is no big surprise.  Grisham continues his predictable formula once again.  Though not really bad, it's nothing great.  At times enlightening, it's mostly made so anyone can quickly breeze through it.  As usual, Grisham remains fluid and doesn't get sidetracked or bogged down in annoying or useless details.<br />A decent book, but a somewhat bad one for Grisham.	2003-03-10

I saw this at a bookstore, read the first chapter, and decided that this book was going to be great.  However, to my horror, the first chapter has hardly anything to do with the rest of the book.   It's becomes quite apparent that Cantor didn't want to write about the plague, but wanted to write about a few isolated characters during that time.  The publishers could not have cared less about some friar or some random land holder from the middle ages, so he disguised this book as a book about something interesting.<br />I'm not sure Cantor had any intention other than to relay some random, useless research into a loose collection.  This book lacks readability, cohesion, and fluidity.  In this small book, he devotes almost a fifth of it to a one useless young princess who dies.  He describes her life, her relatives, her travels and on and on.   He goes into every detail about her life, except he forgets that no one cares.  This book should be about the plague, not about some random midevil life.  He pulls nearly the same stuff with other random people that really don't shed any light about the plague.  He intermittingly and hapharzadly throws in some stuff to tie things together.<br />About only a quarter of the book is about the plague, and most of it lacks statistics or scientific merit.  The only reason this book is not truly, truly awful is that some of the reading is informative, especially about the origins of the plague and other diseases in the mortality chute in the Nile region, and the possibility of anthrax contributing to the death count.<br />All in all, this book is almost worthless.  Just ignore the title and the summary on the cover, as it is a total fabrication.	2003-03-10

It's basically how a group of MIT students combine together and take millions from major Casinos.  Using team play, sound probability, expert training, and skill, they do the impossible and create havoc for the Casinos, and later themselves.<br />This book describes it all, and yes, it's better than any made up story a fiction writer could produce.  Mezrich describes how Kevin Lewis became involved in what later became a lifestyle of glamor, big money, and even woman.  Kevin goes from a geeky swimmer at MIT to a big player winning big money.<br />Mezrich knows how to weave the story.  First he discusses the introduction, then the frightening orientation.  He delves into the mathematics, the strategy, and how the teammates fit into what character roles.  He shows how intricate the team aspect of blackjack works, and how they capitilized on it.  Both seedy and genious, it sheds a whole new life on blackjack and casino gambling.<br />After that, he then starts showing how Casinos work, especially how they treat you when you're a big player versus when you're a card counter.  Without giving too much away, this story not only deals with the winning, but also with the repercussions.  Mezrich brings into the lifestyle, not only with the glamor, but also the suspense and terror that accompanies it.<br />This books is one of those few books that you cannot put down.  It's a great story and most importunely, a great eye-opener.  To top it off, it's all true.<br />No one who reads this will be able to gamble the same way again.  No exaggeration.  Just pick up this book.  I bet you can't put it down (terrible pun intended).	2003-03-10

The thought of miniaturizing one's self and going into a body in order to save it seemed lame and contrived.  Because of this,  I avoided this book for the longest time.  Finally, I gave in and gave it a chance.   It was worth it.<br />The book has some flaws.  The flow of the book is not very fluid.  It's somewhat abrupt and I was forced to re-read a few paragraphs, especially in the beginning.  Even though the level of detail is great, it sometimes became too much and I was bogged down with a cell structure instead of concentrating on the action.<br />That said, the rest of the book is amazing.  Asimov does a great job explaining how miniaturization works, and develops an interesting scenario involving wars, weapons, spies, and scientists in which such a procedure was neccesary under a specific time frame.  The characters themselves are not truly developed, but instead are used to focus and contribute to the action.  A major plus indeed.<br />Asimov seems to weave a story where the human body turns out to be a major battlefield.  A place where blood flow causes havoc and where white blood cells are monsters.  He transports the reader into a new dimension where the mundane suddenly becomes catostrophic.  With this, and his knowledge of the human body, he make a great action and suspense novel.<br />This is a short read and gets to the point.  Asimov wanted to write a great tale involving action and biology, and it is well done.	2003-03-10

In this book, Barbara Ehrenreich decides to perform an experiment where she will cast off her diplomas and journalistic experience and get a job as a low skill worker in a series of places.  She actually chooses to be a Waitress, a House-Cleaner, and then a Wal-Mart employee.  She will only live off what she earns, and will not tell anyone about her book until the very end.<br />While noble and somewhat insightful, she tries desperately to insight pity and utterly fails.  She tries the typical black and white approach of showing the corporate or owner class exploiting the workers.  She provides plenty of examples of her poor treatment, but doesn't provide much insight.<br />Her criticisms are one-sided.  She rarely blames her coworkers, or even herself.  She complains that the drug tests are unfair and that it prevented her from landing a job.  Well, gee, maybe she shouldn't have taken drugs?  She feels sorry for a fellow waitress at a local restaurant, but doesn't really mention that it's her fault for not going to another restaurant that could treat her better.  She talks with a co-worker who quit college because of a lack of funds.  She doesn't mention that whether or not he even tried for financial aid, which, believe me, is definitely available for low-income independent students.<br />One of the worst flaws of the book is that she only experiences the first few months of a job, and doesn't really research the long-term ramifications.  I know for a fact that many low skilled jobs offer large pay raises, medical insurance, and even 401(K)s after a few years of work.  She conveniently ignores that.  She even ignores all pretense of a book and starts trying to unionize Wal-Mart employees.<br />This book is not all bad.  When you're finally accustomed to the whining, it actually provides a lot of information.  It's cleanly written and flows smoothly.  I do admire the fact that this book was made, I admire the effort, and I think it's a book that should have been written.<br />Of course, in an ironic twist, since this book is in trade paperback form, it's largely unaffordable to the people she worked with in the book.	2003-01-30

It was interesting to see how the character's grew and what each one has accomplished.<br />One of my major complaints about the Belgarion series was that plot was only worth 2 to 3 books, and was stretched to 5 books.  This series is only worth about half a book, but it's stretched out to 5 agonizingly long and boring books.<br />This book is probably the best of the bunch, not because it's really better, but because you haven't got sick of the series yet.<br />In this book, Garion is a King, but his son is kidnapped by a some mysterious person leading them to another prophecy that slowly becomes unraveled.

While a good idea, it seemed like every force in the neighborhood didn't want him to skip Christmas.<br />It's filled with light humor and good observations.  On a deeper note, it deals with conformity in a society.  Both work and are enjoyable.<br />As usual, Grisham is fluid and writes a good tale.  His non-law books are the best, not because he can't make a good legal thriller, but that he's a much better storyteller instead.<br />Unfortunately, he adds a little plot twist in the middle of the book, resulting in a cheesy, happily ever after ending that didn't fit with the book.<br />At less than 200 pages, this book is a quick read, but perhaps not the best value.	2003-01-30

About ten pages out of the 400 or so pages further the plot along, and that's about it.<br />It's boring, dull, and should not have been written.	2003-01-30

Unfortunately, Crichton decided to spend half the book building a mystery that is answered on the front sleeve of the book.  The mystery falls flat, as the main character thinks his wife is cheating. Of course, that is not true, but it takes Crichton a heck of lot of time to get to the point.  His \\"insights\\" into Silicon Valley are pretty much an extrapolation of stereotypes.  <br />About 140 pages into it, he finally starts the darn book as the main character gets to Nevada.  It's a finally action packed, fluid, and fun, despite the fact that it feels like a blatant [take] of the movie Tremors.  But hey, it was a good movie.  Just replace worms with nano-particles, and you've got the same thing.<br />Then, in the ending, it gets truly surreal with the typical hack ending.  The last twenty pages are pretty much a yawner.<br />His classic fluidity, and the 100 pages of action are what makes this book somewhat enjoyable.  <BR> <BR>Without a doubt, one of his worst books.  Timeline and now this.  It seems like Crichton's career is just about winding down.  Maybe he and Tom Clancy can move in with other Al Gore, MC Hammer, Michael Jordan, and other has beens.	2002-12-14

I'll be straight about it.  I think the Xbox is a joke.  It has only survived this long because of Microsoft's deep pockets and commitment to monopolistic behavior.  It's pretty certain that if the Xbox ever dominates the gaming industry, all the progress we've seen from gaming would come to a grinding halt.  For example, what's the difference between Windows 95 and Me, IE 2.0 and IE 6.0, Office 95 and 2000?  You see my point.<br />Now that I've got my technological, economic, and philosophical rant out of the way, on to the book.  The bad part of this book is that at some points, it's almost an advertisement for the Xbox.  The other parts, however, are great.  Takahashi gives unprecedented access to the creation of the Xbox.  Not just technically, but in terms of finances, company wide politics, relationships with vendors, and a look into the people who developed it.<br />Granted, this in not much a video console book as much as it is a business incubation study.  That's what is really pleasing about it.  It just happened to be that a video game console is one of the more interesting products to develop.<br />This is well written, the language is fluid, and it's all encompassing.  It goes from how one man made a terrible game, then combined with a few other friends to make a console.  It goes through its battle within Microsoft, from finding a good economic model, to fighting off the WebTV department.  It then delves into supplier issues, game development issues.  It ends up with the marketing and development of the game console itself.  All the while probing the lives and histories of people involved.<br />The only other problem besides the pro Xbox feel was that chronologically, Takahashi tends to skip around a bit, resulting in confusion as certain points.<br />Other than that, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.	2002-11-27

I liked this book because it was a page-turner.  I hated this book because it really wasn't funny or interesting or intriguing.  It's not a bad book, just a book worthy of Tom Arnold's semi-celebrity.<br />First off, it's small, quick, and fluid and very readable.  That's always a huge plus.  Also, a few of the stories are fun, like the parking war with the Seinfield cast.  <br />Here's the bad.  Tom likes to discuss his views and family, friendship, and how to live life.  Of all the people in the world, why would I want to know Tom Arnold's opinion on this topic?  Also, many of his stories and family problems are just not interesting.  He speaks in general terms, instead of getting into funny specific stories.  Finally, it dawned on me that his life is just not interesting, and it shows.<br />It's a good page-turner, occasionally funny, but not something I could recommend to everyone.	2002-11-27

Landsburg explains simple concepts through the eyes of an economist with blinders on.  It's an interesting read where pages seem to fly by.  For an educational book, it flows as freely as a novel, and is incredibly gripping for something about economics.  He presents different scenarios, from the price of popcorn to government debt, and shows how a true economist would view each situation in small bite sized chapters.  It's both refreshing, and at some points, eye-opening.<br />One problem is that he tends to simplify everything way too much.  It's hard to relate what he says to the real world when many of the details are gone.  For example, when explaining national debt, he talks about the lending rate, and the rate of return to being exactly the same.  He doesn't explain what would happen if they were different.<br />Another problem I had is the lack of continuity.  He seems to switch from one topic to another without any direction.  Sometimes, the types of arguments were repeated from one hundred pages ago, while the previous page had nothing to do with the current page.  With about 30 or so seemingly random arguments and situations present, it's hard to place it all into any lesson or theme.<br />Finally, and most importantly, Landsburg seems to take out his aggressions and displays some mean spirited rants in the latter part of the book.  I felt that it incredibly hurt his credibility.  When someone starts debasing someone else's opinion vehemently and atrociously, it gives the impressions of fanaticism rather than cool-headed thinking.  He seems to enjoy criticizing every line of particular papers and making the writer feel like an idiot.  He even goes so far as to reprinting a letter he wrote to his daughter's kindergarten teacher espousing the horrors of environmentalism and how the teacher is indoctrinating his daughter into it.<br />I would recommend this book as good, fun, quick read.As an educational piece, it needs to be more organized and more levelheaded.	2002-11-18

US	49194495	R3RXFVF1YEUTLT	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	3	6	10	N	N	Overhyped	This overtly philosophical novel is about Howard Roarke.  This book describes the career of a fiercely independent architect, who exemplifies Ayn Rand's objectivism.  His career is juxtaposed with a colleague from college, Peter Keating, and is intertwined with other characters, including a unique woman named Dominique, a successful businessman name Wynand, and a famous \\"intellectual\\", Tooley.<br />Rand thoroughly describes each individual's concept of humanity throughout the book.  This is strength, and a flaw.  The dialogues are very, very contrived, and at points insulting to the reader's intelligence.  Keating and Roarke's rivalry was thoroughly enjoyable.  To see such those two in tandem, though extremely overt, was stimulating.  The inclusion of other characters, especially Dominique, bored me to death.  Even though she provides a sort of bridge between two the two rival philosophies, her intrusion into the story is convoluted and serves little purpose than to occupy pages.<br />This book contains a great message.  It's almost hard to find anyone who doesn't relate to Howard Roarke's character.  It's lack of subtlety, its super preachy and continuous dialogues, annoying other characters, all deter it from making it an enjoyable read.  I found myself glued to some pages, while trudging through others.  It's best to describe this as an essay containing fictional characters, rather than a classic novel.<br />Some people say that this book changed their life.  Fair enough, but all the philosophy and messages are presented throughout simple economic principles, historical affairs, and common sense.  The only true insight I gained from this was the definition of objectivism.  Not worth 700 pages of only mildly interesting reading.<br />Would I recommend this book?  Probably, it's not that bad, and you can decide for yourself.	2002-11-13

He writes an interesting novel with some uninteresting people.  He starts off with Danny, a man who fortunately or unfortunately inherits two houses.  A fire by his friend leaves him with only one house, and eventually a multitude of friends finds themselves staying with him.<br />I'd like to consider Danny and his friends the original slackers, the pre-cursors to Beavis and Butt-Head.  The sole purpose of Danny and his friends' life is to drink wine and leave all their cares behind.  They go through, talk about, or hear about all sorts of little adventures.  Some of these adventures revolve around getting drunk, some are more serious, and some are even more hilarious.<br />Through this series of time, Danny and his friends foster friendship and camaraderie, and even at points seem to develop a conscience.  Heartwarming, funny, and in the end, tragic, this is a decent novel.<br />Unfortunately, this novel just didn't have the pace of which a good book should.  Also, the characters, with the exception of the ending and of the Pirate, didn't elicit much emotion, sympathy, or intrigue.  In the end, this book is about those characters, and could have delivered more.<br />I would marginally recommend this tale about some poor paisanos in a poor area called Tortilla flat.  Though not captivating, it is interesting and original.	2002-11-13

Though not finished by any means, this book is completely below his standards.  This is a book about a renascence pope during the and his three most beloved children.<br />For a book in a different time and place, it does little to provide a general feel for the scenery and situation.  For a book with interesting characters, it does little to make us feel sympathy or hatred towards them.  For a book about war, sex, betrayal, deceit, it's very tame and very boring.<br />The book starts of badly.  It basically describes the Rodrigo Borgias family in a sort of adult \\"See spot run\\" way.  He doesn't delve into stories or personal insights, but just blandly describes facts as is.  The middle is even worse, where Puzo seems almost infatuated with an incestual relationship that unfortunately lasts for the entire book.<br />The book gets better in the latter half.  Finally, a plot of some sorts starts to develop, and character development comes to fruition.  Unfortunately, it still falls very short from being interesting.  The \\"battles\\" are really not anything, the family deceit is really just grazed upon, and the setting is passed by as if it was nothing.  Couple this with the fact that he added characters or reference to people like Michaeveli, Michaelangelo, and Da Vinci made it seem like he was reaching for something that wasn't there.<br />I'd pass on this book.  I prefer to remember Puzo for the Godfather or The Fortunate Pilgrim.	2002-11-13

There are many people who describe the original Dune series as a great work of art and literature, and should not be altered at all.  I am not one of those.  I found the latter books of the series to be some of the worst books I have ever read.  I actually found the prequels to be entertaining as well.<br />One main problem I had with the three prequels written previously was that they really shouldn't have been written.  Though I enjoyed them, they had that profit-taking tinge to it.  This series, however, needed to be written.  Throughout the whole series, there were constant, constant references to the Butlerian Jihad.  This jihad seemed to define a big chunk of the Dune, and for me, was a constant source of wonder.<br />This book starts off this new series by describing the beginning of an epic war between robots and humans.  Not only does it help define this struggle, the elements of the dune series begin to develop.  The origins of Mentats, Bene Gessarit, Spice, Fremen, Wormriding, the animosity between Harkonnen and Artriedes, and what happened to Earth, are all started here.  It's a great way to understand and appreciate the original Dune.<br />This book revolves around Xavier Harkonnen and Serena Butler.  In an interesting and likeable twist, Harkonnen is considered a great hero, and serves humanity, while Vorian Artriedes starts off as evil person bent on destroying humanity.  This books describes and chronicles three different sets of planets.  The computer controlled planets, the aligned planets fighting them, and the unalighned planets of humans.  This describes the origins of the computer \\"Evermind\\" that controls the robot planets, and the cymeks (human brains, robotic bodies) who work under it.  It then starts off with battles.  Though the dialogue between robots and other robots is a bit weird, and the start of the revolution is a bit contrived, it still does not take away from the action filled and very informative nature of this book.<br />I wouldhighly recommend this book to anyone who felt cheated with Frank Herbert's last four Dune novels and his philosophical rants, and wanted to return to the world of Dune.  This books if fun and a true page-turner.	2002-11-13

This books starts off sort of convoluted.  I wasn't sure where it was going.  Was it a history of wrestling, or about Vince McMahon?  Though he throws in some pre 1980 history.  It's very incomplete.  He tosses in names, some organizations, but does not provide attendance figures or the economics of wrestling, or the amount of fans.  It's sort of half completed chronicle that leaves one more confused.<br />The second half is much better.  He starts describing the WWF as it turned national, and really concentrated on its war with WCW, politicians, scandals, and its own wrestlers.  It includes facts, people, attendance, ratings, and financial information.  He vividly paints a picture of Vince McMahon, and his company, that neither bashes him nor glorifies him.<br />He goes into details about wrestlers, about the scandals, about negotiations.  He successfully presents the family, the business, the personal, the political, and the economic stories that the WWF produced in the nineties.  From a shady hodgepodge of investments, to national prominence, to almost complete destruction, and finally to a billion dollar corporation.  He goes into the Monday night Raw - Nitro wars, the story of Hulk Hogan's fall from greatness, the Owen Hart debacle, and the last, controversial WWF match of Brett \\"The Hitman\\" Hart.<br />This appears as more of a history book than an opinion about a man.  It does not preach or defend, but instead tells interesting tales and presents all the facts.  At the end of the book, one could get a complete picture of the WWF.  I would highly recommend this book.	2002-11-08

The only way to find out the truth for myself was to read one of his books.  Being the naturally lazy man that I am, I grabbed the smallest book of his I could find.  Little did I know that this book was a fairy tale, and not something that would rouse Islamic fundamentalists.<br />Anyway, I already purchased it and decided to read it anyway.  At first, I saw that Rushdie had a great imagination and could weave a great story.  <br />This book is about Hauron, a boy living in a glum city where his dad is a prime storyteller.  He travels to a far away city, only discover that a Water Genie has stopped his dad's faucet to the sea of stories.  In order to help his father, he travels to the Sea of Stories and engages in a war to save the sea, and his father, while meeting interesting characters and seeing interesting sights.<br />The book starts off well, with Rushdie's almost poetic use of language.  The book, however, slowly digresses.  Not that Rushdie's work disintegrates, but as the fairy tale progresses, with even more characters, and even more anomalies, it gets pretty dull after a while.  The ability to shock or dazzle the reader is weened away until it becomes a chore to finish the book.  <br />I would say that this book is good for a change of pace, and at only 200 pages, won't take too long to read, but I could only marginally recommend it.	2002-11-08

The survival of two Americans on a foreign tropical island is truly fascinating, and is gripping.  The story itself is a great piece of non-fiction.  Definitely movie making material.  Unfortunately, the author couldn't convey this excitement in the most efficient way.<br />His language tends not to be fluid.  He goes into details that are unnecessary and sometimes boring.

Before I was to set to embark upon a long secluded road trip, I decided to check out the public library's audio book section.  I saw Queen of the Damned and thought that if they made a movie about it, it must be somewhat enjoyable.  I should have known why no one watched the movie.<br />Maybe because the audio book was abridged, but this book made no sense whatsoever.  First, some guy is walking about, then some woman talks about her family, then some funky dreams occur, some queen kills a lot of religious males for some apparent reason, then ancient Egyptian cannibals are brought in to the mix, then the same queen dies.  Apparently, Queen Akasha destroyed a village of people eaters, except two twins during ancient Egyptian times.  The Queen comes back, gets mad a lot, and faces the same twins in the final battle.  That's pretty much it.<br />I saw the Interview with a Vampire, I thought that this might capture some of the essence.  Not even close.  Avoid this like the plague.	2002-08-27

Then he describes how the simple magnet in water was discovered, and how it evolved it what it is today.

Aczel has a way of making the most mundane really interesting.  He wrote one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read in Fermat's Last Theorem.  With this book, he continues his combination of a math book with the movement, clarity, and pace of a novel.  The unfortunate part about this book is that no matter how good Aczel tries, the subject of infinity is not as interesting.<br />This is a chronicle with some mathematicians' obsession with, and the history of, the concept of infinity.  First, he goes into the ancient origins of infinity, from Pythagoras to the discovery of irrational numbers, to the Jewish sect that dealt with infinity.  Then he explains Galileo, Bolzano, and others' perspectives and expansion of infinity, including set theory.<br />The most important part deals with George Cantor, a man who expanded upon, and ultimately went insane trying to figure out infinity.  He details his steps towards madness, and his views on set theory, it's axioms, and the concept of order of infinity.<br />Unfortunately, though told brilliantly told, doesn't capture the interest that Fermat's Last Theorem elicited.  The concept of infinity, and it's order, is not that interesting a subject, as it lacks a practical purpose, and is not a problem that many have dealt with, educational or otherwise.<br />Overall though, it's a very good book, and I highly recommend it.	2002-08-27

Grisham, who is one of my favorite authors, spews out this terrible book for no reason.  In a contrived, boring, unbelievable story, Grisham goes through the motions in this long, drowned out novel.  <br />A young boy, from a poor trailer family, tries to intervene in a suicide, only to be caught in a web of secrets concerning the missing body of a Senator.  With the mob, FBI, and an old boring lawyer, the very young boy, who Grisham portrays as the smartest, most cunning person ever for some odd reason, has to endure a lot of annoying stuff in order to get to an ending that everyone, but Grisham, knew was going to happen.  <br />A poor boy finds out a secret that puts his life in danger from the mob.  Sounds like the perfect solution would be the witness protection program?  Guess what, that is the ending.  Of course, for some reason Grisham goes about in the most roundabout, superfluous way.  There was no story here.  <br />This book is pointless, boring, repetitive, and the young kid, who Grisham accidentally blessed with a superhuman intelligence and an amazing ability to annoy, absolutely kills it.  <br />I have no idea what Grisham was thinking when he was writing this book.

You already knows who wins.<br />This book switches back and forth from a lousy story to a wanna-be soft porn and should be avoided.  Maybe the unabridged book is better, but I could not see how.<br />I would not recommend this book.	2002-08-20

I can't wait for Jayson Williams' to describe his prison sentence, from his takes on soap on a rope, to prison food; it will be a laugh riot.<br />Seriously, this book provides insight to Williams' personal and professional life, along with life in the NBA.  This book is full of one to two page stories concerning a wide range of stories, from truly touching, to laugh out loud.<br />One story describes how he was about to kill the murderer of his two sisters, only to let him go.  Another story tells how he was so drunk, he woke in Phoenix thinking that he was in New York after a bomb blast.  When meeting the GM of the Suns for the first time, he asked if he could call his Mom to see if she was alright, in which afterwards he was promptly traded.<br />This book is full of very interesting tales that turn this into a great page-turner.  This is truly one of the greatest sports books of all time.  He doesn't glorify or vilify anyone, he just tells it how it is.<br />If he comes out with another book, I'll be the first one to pick it up at the store.  You can drive, while I'll take shotgun (get it?).<br />This is the ultimate book for anyone who likes sports.	2002-08-20

One man meant to only bomb a building, but instead kills two innocent children and destroys another life.  Thirty years later, one of the bombers in sitting on death row, a former Klan activist, waiting to die when his unknown grandson appears as a lawyer in hopes to rescue him.<br />Grisham does another excellent job describing a story, with great mastery and fluidity, of one man's last ditch effort to save his grandfather from death.  Even though his emphasis on law is profound, he delves into deeper issues such as family, the question of the death penalty, and other emotional issues that one does see in other Grisham novels (with the exception of A Painted House).<br />What's really fascinating is that nothing in this book is not black and white.  For each issue he brings up, there are good and bad points - each issue is a gray area.  He describes the horrors of death row, but then juxtaposes it with the deaths of the two youngsters.  Instead of making the main character purely good or evil, he mixes it a bit.  Sometimes you wish the inmate would fry, sometimes you feel he's innocent.  <br />Another good point about the book is that it's not a farfetched story, like the Street Lawyer or the Firm, it's a book that could be confused with a documentary.  He doesn't revolve action or plot twists, but instead relies on the psychological aspects of all sides of a death sentence.  <br />The only bad point, of which Grisham tends to do a lot, is he is repetitive.  Many, many parts were repeated over and over again.  This 700-page book could have been reduced to 500-page book without any loss of detail.  Pages 200 to 400 just dragged on and on and on.  The last 150 pages, though nothing exciting happens, is really intense and emotional, and is what makes this book.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone.  It's a slight departure for Grisham, as he delves into more psychological elements, but it works well.	2002-07-17

Pablo Escobar, through humble roots, managed to become the most feared and powerful man in Colombia through his notorious drug business.  This book documents the efforts of the U.S. and Colombian governments to capture Pablo, and Pablo's efforts to evade and subdue those forces.  A truly marvelous book that documents the greatest criminal investigation ever.<br />I would have normally never considered reading a book like this.  I tend to find non-fiction dry and uninteresting.  This was the exact opposite of what I expected.  Written by the same author of Black Hawk Down (which I consider the best war movie ever), he expertly weaves a great tale, dealing with the micro and macro events in this interesting saga.<br />This is a true page-turner and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  To further continue raving about the book, I would have to give away details, and that wouldn't do this book any justice.	2002-07-17

What turns out to be a mere curiosity turns into a full-scale invasion.  Told from the story of one man, who survived this whole ordeal, this story reveals the Martians, the attempts to subdue the Martians, and the reaction of the human species.<br />What is most marvelous about this book is that it was written in 1898, but with only a few minor modifications, you could have said it was written in 2002.  The language is suprisingly modern, the plot is still as interesting as ever, and the human aspects of this book still resonate today.<br />What impressed me about this book is that the events unfold through the eyes of one man.  We, the readers, uncover the mysteries and horrors of the aliens as he does.  We get to see the large the curious onlookers, the scared masses, the insane lonely man, the giant tripod machines scrounging around looking to kill, and the battles between human and alien.  We feel his terror and awe as any man would during that crisis.  This book isn't a timepiece, it isn't a love story, it concentrates on action, mystery, and suspense.<br />It's a classic tale that Hollywood and other writers have borrowed upon time and time again.  Unfortunately, none of the copies could stand up to this original.<br />I would highly recommend this book, if just to see how an 1898 action book could entertain anyone today.	2002-07-17

The only problem is that quantum theory, space-time curvatures, virtual/real antiparticles/particles, wave/particle duality, the anthropic principles, ¼, ½, 1, 2 spin particles, relativity, quantum chromodynamics and other such topics cannot all be explained in a few pages each.  Even it were, these new teachings could not easily be used to further construct more elaborate theory without more in-depth knowledge anyway.<br />This book is not an easy read, but it is a page-turner.  Sometimes you'll find yourself re-reading a paragraph, and sometimes you'll be forced to skip an explanation and take Hawking's assumption at face value.<br />His explanation of the macro universe is easily followable, but when delves into quantum theory, the book loose much of it's momentum.  He tends to assume quite a bit about the reader's knowledge.  For example, he constantly refers to virtual particles, yet he never explains what exactly those are.  For most readers, college physics was years ago, or might not have even been taken.<br />I was able to pick up most of the paragraphs, but unfortunately I wasn't able to piece them together cohesively.  At some points he digresses into black holes, then wormholes, then quantum theory, or other topics that don't quite fit at the moment.  Understandably, each topic is required, but Hawking does a relatively poor job wrapping everything up in a nice little package for each chapter.<br />Though sometimes frustrating, it is an eye opener and an interesting topic.  I wished it went deeper into history, and provided a primer for the most basic theories he uses.  I would recommend this to anyone who just studied advanced physics as a way to broaden and appreciate what they just learned.	2002-07-17

Good thing, because without it, this book would be lousy.  You pretty much can predict the rest of this book from page 50, and the cliches are endless.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is a good, lazy day read.  It starts off well enough, like most Grisham novels, with a bit of action.  A homeless man takes a law office hostage.  He is later shot, but one of the hostages wonders why such a homeless man would target this office.  What it turns out is that the homeless man was evicted from a slum by the same law office he works for.  Through lies and deception, the law firm was indirectly responsible for his homelessness.<br />Later, this overworked, yuppy lawyer goes to the homeless guy's community service lawyer, becomes enthralled with helping the poor man, becomes an idealist, unshackles himself from money, and on and on.  Just fill in the other cliches you'd find in tons of other stories and that's this book<br />No real surprises, and the ending is pretty obvious.  The characters are either really good, or really evil, with no gray areas.  You know the good guy wins, and the main character is going to help the little guy, so it's kind of pointless.  But it's Grisham, so you'll be entertained.	2002-07-17

I would have thought the only way to make a Math book interesting would be to have it be a pop up book where the Numbers would start attacking you or something.  Let's face it, math blows bit time.  This makes Aczel's work even more amazing.    <br />This relatively small book reads even quicker than its size.  I completed it in one day - a weekday, with a full day of work no less.  Akzel's turns the proof of a 300-year-old equation into a great work of literature.  He goes through the proof in a unique way, by describing the history of each part of the proof chronologically.  He give mathematical history lessons stretching from Babylonian times to the present day in a way that any layman can understand.<br />Even if you have no interest in numbers or equations, this book will fascinate you.  It helps me understand why professors devote their whole lives to mathematics.  Heck, it even got me a little interested in Math as well (of course I snapped out of once the Simpsons came on).<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone.	2002-07-17

She explains the cost, and details it with smidgen of statistics and a lot of one-person stories.  Though one sided, it does do an excellent job of telling her point of view.<br />She details the effects fanatic pace of the average white collar worker, the invasion of the professional life into the private life, the effects of layoffs, the slow erosion of benefits, and the complete absence of job security.  She incorporates great stories about companies, certain people, CEOs, and certain ideas.<br />This book is a fluid page-turner and puts most other non-fiction books to shame.  It's an easy read that captures and fascinates you.<br />The main flaw in the book is \\"evil corporation\\" and victimization idea, and how CEOs are just in for stock market increases.  She doesn't blame the stockholders, which are often pensions and mutual funds, for supporting such short-sided CEOs.  She gives the impressions that layoffs are all bad, and that they should be avoided totally, despite the health of the company and economy.  Most importantly, she places no guilt on the employees who continue to endure the continuously demanding pressures of their job.  Instead of quitting, they abide by their job in order to pay for their current lifestyle, despite the increasing workload and disappearing benefits.  It's not the corporation's fault that there is a huge mortgage or car payments, it's purely on the employees end there.	2002-07-17

Someone lent me the Harry Potter DVD, and I must admit I was impressed, so I decided to pick up this book.  After reading it, I must say it's not that bad after all.<br />I can see why Harry Potter series is as popular as it is.  It's an imaginative tale of magic and fun, throw in a magic school, interesting teachers, monsters, ghosts, and good old school yard camaraderie and rivalries, and anyone can see the appeal.  I wish these books were released ten years earlier so I would have enjoyed it more.<br />Harry Potter continues another school year with the same gang of characters, except right before school, he receives a hilarious but ominous warning about dyeing this year.  What turns out is that a monster is loose at Hogwarts, causing havoc and fear for all.  Harry and his friends must solve the mystery of the monster, who let the monster out, and how to stop it.<br />I wish there were more dialogue and more action, as description after description could get tedious sometimes, especially for the young.  However, it is still a good book, and I might continue reading the rest of the series.	2002-07-17

I've lived in the Bay Area for 7 years now, and I never thought of it as anything but and urban and suburban mesh.  I wanted to start hiking, but I felt that I needed to travel to national parks far away to enjoy it.  I was really mistaken.  This book is beyond amazing.<br />I'm not going to say this is the bible of hiking, but whenever I open it, a beacon of light shines upon it and the air is filled with cathedral like chanting.<br />I was totally unaware of the natural beauty and ambience that was located locally.  Some of these places described are amazing.  I went on all the strenuous hikes described in this book, and I enjoyed each one.  From redwoods, to waterfalls, to beaches, to mountain vistas, it's all there.  <br />The author provides ratings, directions, description, difficulty, approximate times, pricing, and weather information for each hike.  If it weren't for these descriptions, I would never have seen the huge redwoods in the peninsula or the amazing beach and postcard views at Point Reyes.  <br />There are only a few minor flaws in this book.  The strenuous hikes are pretty easy for anyone is shape, and only take about 3/4ths the time suggested.  The directions are sometimes a bit bare, but I never was really lost so it's not too much of a problem.<br />If you want to enjoy the outdoors, no matter what fitness level, get this book.  It's everything you need to have many nice enjoyable day hikes.	2002-05-08

The main problem I have is that for most of the book is that hardly anything happens.  This book neither captivates you with a plot, develops any characters, or immerses you in a setting.  <br />Basically, a man gets hypnotized and starts reading peoples minds and predicting the future.  He sees a ghost, reads a neighbor's mind, has an encounter with a baby sitter, and fights with his wife.  That's the first ninety percent of the book.  Matheson probably realized that nothing happened, so he threw in some hackneyed plot twist to add some excitement.  Needless to say, it doesn't work.<br />Another problem I had with this book is the flow and language structure.  He likes throwing brief tidbits of conversation, which annoyed me to death.  Many times I had to re-read paragraphs due to the fact that he omitted context and who said it.<br />Ignore all those people who say that this delves into great psychological terror.  Nope, it deals with a boring man with a boring gift living a boring place.  Silence of the Lambs this ain't.  What makes a good book?  Not being able to put it down.  What makes a bad book?  Not being able to pick it up.  This book is boring and tedious - the only reason why I finished it is because I actually spent my hard earned money on it.	2002-04-15

It's more like a description of an acid trip than anything else.  A university professor, recovering from malaria, is fired for a controversial paper deriding idols and artifacts of certain gods.  Apparently, this angers some spirits, and after seemingly losing a few hours of his life and his hat, he descends (literally) into a world of weird characters and doors and life forces involving his wife and best friend.<br />It's hard not to give away the plot, because the plot is only revealed in the end.  It's basically a few huge extremely strange events in one book.  <br />Even though the imagery is very good for this short, Hubbard's language is a little terse and antiquated to make it a quick read.  Though overall pretty interesting, I would not recommend this, as I wouldn't know what to classify it as.	2002-04-01

Grisham mixes up his usual law with a bit of prison and politics to create a neat little intertwined novel.  Definitely not one of his best, but it is entertaining nonetheless.  <br />The book starts with a series of three prisoners as judges jail house courtroom.  It's later discovered that these three judges are part of an elaborate scheme to swindle millions from unsuspecting victims.  While in DC, the CIA head is concocting a scheme to hand the presidency to a relatively unknown house member.  What ensues is a neat dichotomy of small time crime and big time government caught up in each other's corruption.<br />This book is entertaining, especially the details of the election process.  Grisham incorporates his impressive story telling ability to further improve it.  It does have its flaws though.  Mainly, none of the characters really evoke any sympathy, so it's hard to stay attached to the story.  Also, unlike many of his other books, the story doesn't transport the reader to the setting.  It's more like the story occurs passively.<br />I would recommend this book, especially to Grisham fans, even though it's basically an average Grisham book.	2002-04-01

This first book in the Elvis Cole series is a better than average book.  It's a quick small read (I read it in a day).   Elvis, with his biting sarcasm, and Joe Pike, the mysterious non-nonsense detective are introduced.  While not as intriguing or captivating as Crais's latest book, L.A. Requiem, this is not bad at all.<br />Crais's love of conflicting characters starts off with Elvis working with a timid woman looking for her son and husband.  The plot is further enhanced with the introduction of her forceful and diametrically opposed friend.  The plot sifts through the seedy and strange back lots of Hollywood and develops into an interesting mystery.  More than a who done, it's all a why was this done, and what to do next type mystery.  It involves a good mixture of action, suspense, and character development, despite the constant descriptions of unrelated items that seem to slow the book down<br />This book is good little mystery/action book and would be a good bet for a lazy Sunday.	2002-02-18

Little did I know that this book had nothing to do with the law.  It took me a good two hundred pages to figure it out.  The biggest surprise was the fact that this book was the best book I read from him.  Grisham proves his worth as a storyteller by providing the simplest story of all - a seven-year-old farm boy's autumn.<br />While Grisham's greatest strength is his knack for telling a good story, his law novels often go beyond the usual and norm to present an almost unlikely scenario.  This book simply relies on the accounts of a boy whose life is extraordinary by being almost ordinary.  And Grisham pulls this off very well.<br />A boy, living with his parents and grandparents, deals with a typical farmer's struggle - picking season.  The family deals with debt, Mexican and hillbilly laborers, townspeople, neighbors, secret affairs, and even a murder.  Grisham expertly depicts  the simple life of the farmer intermingled with the complexities of rural survival.  From the murder of a brutish laborer, to the kid's first glimpse of television, the book's range from action to touching.  <br />A simple book by a great storyteller, I recommend this book to all.	2002-02-18

Despite being written over one hundred years ago, Wells presents a tale chilling and relevant to this day.  A great story in it's own right, it delves deeper into human technological and biology conflicts that have only intensified in recent years.  With the onset of cloning, gene therapy, and genetic modifications, the issues spark debate to this day.<br />It starts off with Pendrick, shipwrecked, eventually arriving on the Island of Dr. Mareau and discovering strange beasts.  These strange beasts were not natural though, but instead modified animals made up to look and act like humans.  Without giving away the plot, the book then moves into action, while moving into such themes as insanity, animals versus humans, and the existence and treatment of god.<br />This book works as a simple fun filled novel with intrigue, suspense and action.  It's strange to have a book of such magnitude provide so much simple enjoyment.  Even without the deep literary and social meanings, this book stands out by itself.  The only flaw is the somewhat antiquated language.<br />Of course, as a sort of added bonus, the insights and issues brought up provide a great addition.  Such a book could easily be debated in literary and scientific circles.  If such a book was used in my English classes, as opposed to such crud and Faulkner and Jane Austin, I might have actually enjoyed class.<br />The Island of Dr. Maruea is the best mixture of plot and intellectual enjoyment I read since Animal Farm.	2002-02-18

Instead of a well thought out novel, Crais spends needless time on pointless details and intermingles random sarcastic thoughts that only seem to slow down the book to a crawl.<br />The book starts off well with Elvis in charge of finding a priceless Japanese book.  Then the book just moves to the absurd, with a flashy nightclub, family incest, and a strange cult spliced together to form some sore of plot.  The worst part is the detail that takes away from the weak plot.  A prime example is a four-page interlude where Crais describes a man drinking coffee and how a room is arranged.  Worst of all, the coffee and the room mean absolutely nothing to the book.  Approximately ten percent of the book is devoted to what the detectives eat.<br />Crais tries to save this book with sarcasm.  Of course when every other page contains a supposedly witty remark, the lines get tired and old after a while.<br />Unless you plan to read all the Elvis Cole novels, it'd be best to skip this one.	2002-02-18

A simple thing like disliking a man's story later tears his life apart.  Such a simple constrained life blew up like a high-pressure balloon. <br />While not a story with action or a plot, it is a literary device that portrays the upper-middle class life at that time.  It's a nice timepiece and gives the reader a sense of living that life.  A typical small Depression era American town with a country club and speak easy.  <br />It's a suprisingly quick and easy read, with a good description of life, and an opening for social interests.

Through his mysterious girlfriend and wit, he continually bribes and cajoles jury consultants on both sides.<br />Unfortunately, I just gave away half the plot right there.  Grisham takes over two hundred pages to explain that.  However, this is John Grisham, so the pages do tend to turn quickly.<br />If you're looking for a good Grisham book, I'd suggest The Rainmaker or A Painted House.	2002-02-18

It encapsulates all that should be a good technical book.  It's easy to read, easy to follow, contains lots of useful information, and doesn't bog down the reader with useless specifications or incredibly obtuse details.  <br />From the view of a security newbie, this book provides an all-encompassing view of hacking and counteracting it.  The book starts out with a simple introduction to various system and network technologies, and then details the ways to hack into, and then prevent hacking into these technologies.  The book takes a great view in each chapter.  First it explains the evil hacker's view and how they could exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  Then it follows it up with how to shore everything up and prevent such hacking.<br />This book also goes into the tools, websites, and methods to hack and to counter hack, providing an invaluable reference without annoying the reader with too much information.  Include this with its remarkable readability, and I would say this should be required reading for anyone administrating networks or writing software applications.<br />In short, I could not imagine a better security book around.	2002-02-18

He's in debt because his girlfriend dumped him right after buying her expensive jewelry, while facing the one of the worst Lawyer job markets around, and he just got evicted.  This no luck kid finds the case of a lifetime.<br />Grisham expertly weaves a story about this young lawyer during a crucial time of his life.  Through chance, he joins up with a sleazy law firm, finds and rescues a helpless girl, and takes on a large corporation.  It's a touching story that really makes you root for the main character.  The book is easy and fun read, and like any Grisham novel, the pages fly by. <br />The book is not perfect however.  The ending is predictable and corny, and the hard luck story gets old after a while.  <br />I suggest this book to anyone that wants a good read.  I would not recommend the movie though, as it doesn't capture any of the essence.	2002-02-18

What's left is a hectic aftermath where the family is suing, and the search for the missing sole heir takes a recovering alcoholic to the depths of the Amazon rainforest.  A nice location piece, with action, vivid descriptions, and the usual mixture of Grisham law, is a good read.<br />Grisham mixes in his great mix of characters, a great description of the Amazon and a removed Native American Brazilian tribe, and the intricacies of inheritance laws.  While the plot moves quickly, there's not much to capture the attention.  The reader shares no sympathies with any of the characters, and some characters are too one sided.   At some points, the descriptions get a little dull and overwhelming, especially concerning the family and their lawyers.  <br />I'd like this book, but somehow it was unsatisfying.  It's got the classic Grisham story telling substance, but it's too long for such a simple plot.	2002-02-18

Only Crichton could construct this novel.  Taking a perfectly plausible idea, and turning it into an action and information packed page-turner.<br />Its apparent Crichton has two things going for him - he can write fluidity, and he can write informatively.  He brings the user to world of aviation without confusing or boring the reader.  More importantly, he can do it while incorporating it into excitement and intrigue of the plot.  This is classic Crichton.<br />This is a great, though non-typical mystery. It's not a who done it, but why it happened mystery.  This book is not all great however.  It is, after all, a book revolving around the aftermath of an airplane crash in an aviation company.  The ending is a little unsatisfying, the main character evokes no feeling, and the aggressiveness of the Unions is not too believable.<br />It's a very good book, but it's not in the class of Sphere or The Great Train Robbery.	2001-09-19

A hideous man, Mr. Hyde, suddenly appears out of nowhere and seems to befriend a likable Dr. Jekyl.  Mr. Hyde lives in his residence and enigmatically stays there for long periods of a time.  Only later on does his friends and acquaintances find out that Dr. Jekyl is Mr. Hyde.<br />This novella is an engrossing tale of a divided man.  This mystery, though already known, is a great tale worthy of being a classic.  For a book written over a hundred years ago, it's suprisingly readable, mysterious in the beginning, and exciting at the end.  Even the different narratives hightens this tale.<br />I recommend this book.  It's a good, short mystery.	2001-09-19

A marvel of engineering and deceiving politics is planned in order to bring it to the United States.  An unanticipated psycho sea captain and the mysterious structure of the meteorite itself poses the greatest danger.<br />This book is filled with predictable and boring characters, from the rebel hero who thinks outside the box, to the rich eccentric man who causes a lot of trouble. It also is plagued with a plot that just doesn't unfold quickly enough.  Don't get me wrong, it is a somewhat interesting read though.  The planning of the meteorite lifting, the engineering team, and the final sea chase is worth the price of the book, but that's about it.<br />This book is very reminiscent of Michael Crichton's Sphere, but comes no where close to that level of excitement.  It lacks the suspense and the action level that a book like this should have.  A classic example is the ship they take to pick up the meteorite.  The writer spends more time describing the internals of the ship, then of the dramatic ship chase at the end (sorry about spoiling that).  <br />It's not a great read, but not a bad read either.	2001-09-19

A man goes into surgery to correct his psychotic rage, but the surgery takes a turn for the worse.  He escapes and terrorizes everyone.  In this small book, Crichton spends entirely too much time describing the medical procedures, the hospital politics, and the doctors themselves, while little time on the action or suspense.<br />Usually, Crichton incorporates background and scientific information to further the plot and intrigue and suspense.  Unfortunately, this book is more about the hospital than about the plot.  The plot itself doesn't even contain an engrossing manhunt or chase that one would expect with an escaped maniac.<br />It's not all bad.  It is very much readable, and like most Crichton books, it's fluid and enjoyable.<br />I'd suggest other Crichton books first, but overall, I would half heatedly recommend this.	2001-09-19

As a writer settles back to his hometown to write a novel, a mysterious antique store opens up with some odd owners.  From then on, the vampire situation appears.<br />A small town infested with the living undead is a great premise, but the story just doesn't live up.  Instead of a terrifying takeover and escape story, the book appears almost comical.  Basically, in a period of a few days, a few men try to rescue the town, but do a downright miserable job.  The ending is very disappointing, the characters are not enduring, the language sentence structure is too terse, it's too many pages, and the plot, to put in the vernacular - just sucks.<br />This book is more reminiscent to a bad B-movie.  It tries to scare, but the only frightening part was that fact that other people find it scary.	2001-09-19

The original Phantom of the Opera was a book about a sinister monster that terrorized an Opera and the love of his life. It was thrilling and theatrical at the same time, and a classic. This book is neither.<br />Basically, the Phantom escapes death and becomes a millionaire in Manhattan. He anonymously builds an Opera House and persuades his former love to come back to perform. Then he tries to seduce the girl once again.<br />The book is mostly a description of Erik's and his former lover's life. The thrills and the mystery are all gone. This book is barely a shell of its predecessor, and I don't recommend it all.	2001-09-19

If you think it is, you're just strange.  Anyways, someone gave this book to me because he didn't need it anymore, and learned that I setting up a server for stress testing.  Not being an expert in capacity planning, this provided a good introduction to what some of the expectations were to setting up a server environment.<br />This book is not too readable; it lacks fluidity, and is sometimes repetitive.  Of course, what would anyone expect from this type of book?  One gripe I have with this book is that it's a little too skewed towards to overall management, as opposed to more technical aspects.  For example, it concentrates on how to file a problem ticket more than monitoring network statistics.  <br />This book gives a good idea on how the process works to set up a plan and how to monitor parts of the system.   It doesn't delve to deep into commands, specific examples, and goes in too deep for some parts (like disk capacity), but not too deep into other parts (like memory).<br />It's worth reading, it's a good overview, and it's a template for the few who need to set-up the system.  It won't help as technical reference, or help you once you're in front of the computer however.	2001-09-19

Through the novel, he tries to find meaning and takes a spur of the moment trip to New Orleans with a girl named Kate. Though it deals with an issue that concerns us all at one point of our life - the absence of purpose, it does it in a way that is too unreadable to really enjoy Percy's vision.<br />Though I liked the message, I felt that the plot, if you want to call it a plot, didn't move. Granted, Percy is not trying to tell a story but portray a critical point of one man's life, the novel doesn't grab the reader's attention. It's not a light read, and this is a real disservice because it deals with a concern that many more people could relate to.	2001-09-19

I got a great kick about how he made 101 jokes about how big one certain body part was.  <br />The second part is not the best part, but it sheds some light on who Drew Carey is, and what the show is all about.  It's not the highlight of the book, but even Drew Carey grudgingly admits he didn't want to put it in but felt obliged to.<br />The third part is suprisingly good.  He writes about 4 short stories that, though not humorous, are interesting.  It's classic blue collar literature.  &quot;Tackling Jim Brown&quot; should by all means be considered a classic.<br />Check out the book, and you can show why Drew Carey has a highly rated show and is a great stand up comic.	2001-09-19

He describes an incident concerning an English school teacher, a local Muslim doctor, and two English woman.  He tries, and the keyword here is &quot;tries&quot;, to show the racial and cultural tensions between the English rulers and the Indian locals.  <br />The way the people are presented in this book is a joke.  The main character, Aziz, is laughable.  He's unbelievably subservient.  Also, the portrayal of Hindus is almost clownlike, and the English are presented as extreme snobs.  Forester's India should not be taken as a true representation of India at all.<br />The first half is barely readable.  The language is not too fluid, and the action is slow.  One of my main gripes is that Forester interludes a lot dialog without referring to who is speaking.  It's quite disconcerting.  The second half is much better.  It concentrates on a trial, and the aftermath on friendship.  I was able to read this half in one sitting.<br />The story itself is enjoyable.  The aspects of justice, prejudice and friendship penetrates this novels story in every way.  If this book was about some anonymous countrymen in an anonymous country, this would be well worth the price.<br />I recommend this book, but as a story, and not as a cultural portrayal.	2001-09-19

Sit down with it for a few days, and afterwards, you should know a great deal about MySQL.  It covers everything in a very presentable fashion, and is pretty darn fluid.  Something rare in technical books.  In fact, this is probably the best book out there for MySQL.  <br />Unfortunately, when it comes time for implementation, some parts are really bare.  The normalization chapter is pretty short and cryptic, though it provides a good introduction to the subject.  When it comes to looking up specifics, the warm fuzzy feeling from reading the book slowly melts away.  Trying to look up specifics becomes a real hassle (e.g. creating relations between tables), and it doesn't go into great detail on more complex issues (e.g. installing MySQL).<br />This is a great introductory book.  It's a nice read, and the language is good.  This is not, however, a good reference manual.  Despite that, I would still highly recommend this book.	2001-05-08

Crighton does a wonderful job transporting the reader to the 1800s London.  The descriptions and the detail are flat out amazing.  At some points, it seemed like Crighton himself lived in London during that time.  Though immersed in tremendous detail, it so skillfully done that it does not bog down the reader.  From the making of safes, to burial procedures, to the slums, and to escaping the most unpenetrable prison, the reader is bombarded with mesmerizing detail.  In my opinion, this is the most captivating book ever written.<br />The detail alone would be worth twice the price of the book.  The language, though initially confusing with bits of 1800 English, adds to the effect.  Crighton yet again uses one of his main strengths - fluidity, to heighten this reading experience.  <br />Finally, the plot itself is downright brilliant.  A high class, educated man performs the most brilliant preparations for a mighty bank robbery.  This book chronicles what the man does.  The chapters where he plans out the taking of the keys is some of the most inventive writing ever.<br />This book has great language, superb detail, and an exciting, captivating, intriguing plot.  I would recommend this to book to anyone and everyone.	2001-05-08

The quest for the orb's climatic finish finally occurs in this book.  Garion and everyone else in the group finally battle for the orb.  In a dramatic battle, the orb is taken, and all seems well.  This is the first half of the book, and it was a dousy.<br />The second half of the book, however, is dull and tedious.  No real adventure occurs.  It's merely a read about the management and ruling of the world, and about the princess's feelings.  Nothing more than that.  The series takes a dramatic turn downhill after the orb is taken, and it is by far the worst part of the series.  It's tedious and dull at this point.<br />Edding has the usual stuff going for him - his language - the characters - the development of the prophecy - and the characters.  The arguments between the slave women and the Ulgo are hilarious and witty.  Though probably the worst book in the series, it is still not too bad.	2001-05-08

This book, while not overtly outrageous, it shows scenes of the eccentric life of a few fringe people in Hollywood.  <br />Throughout this book, unique characters are introduced and their lives are showed in the most interesting ways.  From a lonely man who takes in a woman, to the woman who ruthlessly takes advantage of him, to the woman's father, who tirelessly wants to entertain.  A mix of failures, this book portrays a truer Hollywood, where success and glamour are very limited, but where mental diversity is everywhere.<br />While it does do a good job of showing people and situations, the sentence structure is not too fluid.  Sometimes a paragraph or two may have to be re-read.  Also, this book does not have much cohesiveness to it.  With no plot, and no central theme, the book drifts from one scene to the next.  Because of this, it's very hard to be captivated.  By all means, this is not a page-turner.<br />For those interested in books about people, I would recommend this book.  For those looking for insight or story, I would suggest passing up this book.	2001-05-08

To those who remember Al Bundy from the show Married with Children, this book would seem very similar.  Mr. Biswas, from a poor family, is rushed into a marriage that he wasn't prepared for, is at the mercy of his in-laws, has a low paying career, and is stuck with a wife that hates his guts.<br />Mr. Biswas is presented as a loser whose one goal of finding a place of his own.  Without giving too much away, this book follows the simple struggle of Mr. Biswas's life.  It presents a fascinating view of Trinidad and Indian families within.  From crowded Indian houses, to sugarcane fields, to villages, to crowded buses, to resorts, the reader gets a great glimpse of life on the Island.  The reader also gets to follow the life of this man as he struggles in his marriage, his career, with sanity, and the search for his house.  Throughout his life, he lives in crowded and squalid residences, and wishes to live independently from it all.  Thus the name of the book.<br />The one flaw of this book is the monotony.  Mr. Biswas did not live an exciting life, and Naipul forces the reader to look into his most mundane activities.  This readability of this book greatly declines as the book nears the end.<br />Tedious at some points, this book does a great job bringing Mr. Biswas's perspective to the reader.  I would recommend this book to those with some time and patience.	2001-05-08

Eddings takes us through more travels as the group meets more interesting characters.  Though this book consists of more travelling, the meeting of a religiously fanatic Ulgo and an ultra innocent boy named Errand who carries the orb is fascinating.  Eddings has a way of introducing and interesting people, and he does it again.<br />The language is great - the fluidity is still there.  The action sequences are great as well.  The only problem I have this book is the monotony.  The group travels, and after finishing one trail, just starts up another one.  It?s safe to assume that no one in the group is going to die, so the many minor side battles and towns they visit just become meaningless.

Crichton also is known for his brand of science, making the impossible scientifically plausible.  That is what makes the first half of the book great.<br />The second half, however, is just a formulaic middle age adventure.  It's pretty boring, and full of holes.  Basically, the whole plot is this: A greedy corporation makes a time travel machine, and a professor secretly goes back to the Middle Ages.  Once this is found out, the corporation sends a group of graduate students back in time to rescue him.  They gain the king's favor, kill a whole bunch of people, and barely make it back in time.<br />Why did they go back to the Middle Ages, when they could have just gone back to the time right before the professor entered the time machine to stop him?  I'll never figure it out.  How did the graduate students each become super human killing machines?  Got me guessing.  How can they go back in time, kill and alter so many people, and have the present be the exact same?  I wonder how.<br />The second half of the book is an insult to common sense.  Heck, time travel ruined the Star Trek movies, the Superman movies, why not ruin Crichton's series of books as well?<br />Basically, a quick, fun read, with a darn stupid plot.	2001-05-08

Wow, I've never tried to read a book that was so unreadable.  Lowry must have taken great pains to make this book as annoying as possible.  There is no fluidity, the action and drama is convoluted, and there is no cohesiveness to the entire story.<br />I'll be honest.  I could not finish the book.  This is the only review I've written where I did not read the entire novel.  I, however, felt that 100 pages were 90 pages too much.  <br />This is the type of book that turns off casual readers to classic literature.  Only the most fanatical English majors could enjoy reading this book.  It's a shame that this particular book is highly regarded, because it takes away from real works of literature that everyone should enjoy.<br />I would only recommend this book to English professors, and only a few of my worst enemies.	2001-04-30

However, it does tend to be a book where a group of people travels, and that's it.  They travel a road, find some enemies and either kill them or outwit them.  Three hundred pages of this turns out to be monotonous at times.<br />The story is still overall very captivating.  The innocent farm boy, Garion, starts to learn of his powers, his inner being, and his epic mission as he encounters new beings and goes through many different adventures.

The plot is wonderfully done, as the story unfolds itself slowly, adding to the mystery surrounding the boy.  <br />Because of this, I vowed to read every other book in this five part series.  I would recommend this book to anyone.	2001-04-30

I shouldn't even say read, I should say experienced.  What an unbelievable action book!  I cannot praise this book highly enough.  The only complaint that I have against this book is that I ruined my Monday, as I stayed up late on Sunday to finish it.<br />What starts off as an underwater search turns into a harrowing tale of mystery, then action, then suspense, and then psychology.  Without giving much away, the story revolves around a team researching a strange artifact, and things start going wrong.  But why are things going wrong?  Who's responsible?  What's the motivation?  Throughout the book, as the action unfolds, the mysteries and the actions get weirder and more intriguing.  It's a true page-turner.<br />In fact, it's so good, I refuse to see the movie.  No director on Earth could present this book on film as well as it presents itself on paper.  Another adaptation of this book, no matter how good, would only damper my experience.<br />It's so good, I became an instant Crichton fan, and bought as many books of his as I could.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-04-23

It was my first and only musical, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.  I came upon this book in the classics section of a bookstore, and lacking any reading material at the moment, I bought it on a whim.  While the first fifty pages gave a false sense of an artsy motif, the rest of the book proved to be the quintessential horror book.<br />How Andrew Lloyd Webber could make a musical out of a character so wicked, so amazingly brilliant and sinister is beyond me.  It?s like a remake of Dracula where he goes on stage and starts break-dancing.  It just doesn?t work.<br />Despite the somewhat antiquated language (early 20th century, lots of passive sentences), the portrayal of the Opera Ghost is fantastic.  The phantom is gradually exposed as to what he really is as the book progresses, ending in a dramatic rescue sequence.  This book is like a combination of the Pit and the Pendulum and Dracula.  Haunting, entertaining, and fast paced, it?s a shame that this book is more famous for its stage production than for its horror and imagination.<br />If you?re looking for a complement to the musical, pass on this book.  If you?re looking for a great horror and suspense novel, then I definitely recommend this book.	2001-04-23

This book deals with a doctor connected to a death through an illegal abortion.  A small portion of this book deals with why abortions should be legal, and why there should be pity towards the doctors that perform illegal abortions.  Of course, in today?s time, abortions are legal and the point becomes deadened quite a bit.<br />In this book a doctor is accused of killing a woman through an abortion.  Another doctor tries to clear his friend by investigating the case thoroughly.  Without giving too much away, this book details how the doctor investigates the woman and her well connected family through interviews, spying, medical records, and autopsies.<br />While it is a good mystery novel, Crichton doesn?t deliver his normal brilliance.  Unlike the Great Train Robbery, the reader is not totally immersed in the setting.  Unlike Sphere, the reader doesn?t get trapped in the suspense and mystery of the situation.<br />A good, quick, and mildly exciting read, it?s out of date and not up to the extremely high standards that I expect from Michael Crichton.	2001-04-23

While the finally apocalyptic battle between Garion and Torak is exciting, the end of it is somewhat cheesy.  The worst part of the book is the useless fluff written in order to extend the ending into a full-fledged novel.  <br />Going into the fifth book, the reader knows that Garion and Torak will fight an epic battle.  What the reader shouldn?t have to do is drudge through the micro-management of an army travelling, nor read about how a queen runs a country that has nothing to do with the story anymore.  Unfortunately, that?s half the book.  Most of the rest of the book is Garion, Silk, and Belgarad travelling.  Like usual, they travel, almost face capture or death, and escape.  The same sort of thing that happened in the last four books.  It seems like Eddings really wanted to extend this series to five books no matter how useless the material was.<br />Other than that, Eddings does retain his readability, and his imagination is as good as ever.  I recommend this book, however, as it tidies up the prophecy nicely.	2001-04-23

It doesn?t have much to do with the mob, crime, casinos, or gangsters, and it doesn?t have killings, executions, or any other street warfare.  Heck, it doesn?t even have a plot.  Instead, it?s about a family living in New York, and how the mother has learned to survive and raise a family alone.<br />Sounds boring, right?  Wrong.  This could actually be Puzo?s finest work.  From the family?s struggles through poverty and near poverty, to the fights of mother and daughter, to the disobedience of one son, and the suicide of another other, this book is a touching chronicle.  <br />Though not a novel you would expect from Puzo, it?s definitely his most poignant work, and shows that he can live past his Godfather typecast.	2001-01-22

The struggle of the human body and mind to cope with the most difficult of situations.  The adventure, the conflict, the suspense are almost unparalleled in modern fiction.  The only flaw in this book is the fact that it's also somewhat unreadable at other points.<br />First off, nothing of true significance happens in the first 100 pages.  That's one third of the book totally wasted.  A description of an advertising agency, a description of archery, and other such descriptions just disrupt the true meaning of the novel.  Secondly, this book is not one of the most fluid books around.  It's true that this book is fairly modern, but the pages don't turn like a Puzo or Clavell novel.<br />However, once the reader trudges through the first one hundred pages and becomes accustomed to the Dickey's non fluid style, the books becomes a gem.  Without giving away much of the plot, this rest of the book mostly chronicles two days of man's adventure when a simple canoeing trip goes terribly wrong.  <br />The sense of danger, action, suspense is all mixed in with moral dilemmas that make this one of the best adventures in literature.  Dickey turns a simple situation into a complex web of lies, of death, and consequences.  From the matter of climbing a rock face, to lying to cops, Dickey seems to thrust the reader into the problems of the main character.<br />If Dickey trimmed the first 100 pages down to 10, this would be one of the greatest books I?ve ever read.	2001-01-22

This book is story of two books - one of great fluidity, great sequences, -the other one of no plot, little action, and very little intrigue.  Mario Puzo is always a great read, and when reading his works, pages just seem to fly by.  The unfortunate thing is that this book is 500 pages (more like 800 because of the small font) of nothing.<br />There really is no plot.  It basically chronicles a man named John Merlyn for a few years, as he visits or works in Las Vegas, then New York, and then Los Angeles.  Another Puzo novel, the Fortunate Pilgrim, also really doesn?t have a plot, but the characters and description are so interesting, it captivates the reader.  This book has none of that.  The characters are not appealing, a little unreal, and are not really covered in great depth.<br />Also, the book gets repetitive after a while.  Puzo feels the need to describe the same emotions of the some character over and over again in only slightly different situations.  <br />Of the few books I've read of Puzo, this is by far the worst.	2001-01-22

If you are the type of person that enjoys pondering every aspect, every page, and every word - this could be right up your alley.  If, however, you enjoy reading for the sake of reading, skip this book.  <br />It's almost as if Joyce took pains to confuse and annoy the reader.  Though filled with good chunks of reading, the sentence structure is very awkward, and the progression of the book is disjoint and puzzling at times.  Joyce will capture you with some aspect of the main character's childhood, and then switch to an extremely boring dialogue about philosophy.<br />I truly understand what Joyce was trying to convey, and is the reason why it's two stars.  The themes of religion, politics, sex, and money all come in to play, and affect the main character as he moves from childhood, to adolescence, then to his teen years.  If this message was delivered in an easier package, I might have really enjoyed this book.<br />Basically, if I were to write in the same style as Joyce, I would be fired from my job right on the spot.	2001-01-01

I loved the first book, House Artriedes, and expected nothing less.  However, this book did not meet my expectations.<br />The one main flaw was the structure of this book.  Each chapter was about 5 pages long.  There were also quite a few sub plots interweaving.  For many chapters, it took about 4 pages to get the introduction, then one page of concrete storyline, and then a new chapter started describing a different sub plot.  It was hard to get into the rhythm of reading this book when there was no rhythm to begin with.  After about twenty pages of this, I start to lose interest.  It took me forever to trudge through this book.<br />Another thing was that since each subplot was so spread out, a good chunk of material was wasted repeating the same descriptions over and over again.  Though roughly the same size as the House Atriedes, I felt that only about half the action and plot development took place.<br />Finally, it's worth noting that this book is a novel, and not a philosophy lesson like some Dune?s latest books.  If you want a good read, with action, great characters, and a moving plot, read the prequels.  If you want to continue with the philosophical mutterings of Frank Herbert, don't.	2001-01-01

I'm not truly a wrestling fan, but my friends recommended this book to me, so I decided to give it a shot.  Honestly, it was pretty darn good.  Granted, it's not going to win the Pulitzer, but it's got to be one of the most original and well-written biographies I've ever read.  <br />This book chronicles one of the most unique individuals in wrestling's history.  He wasn't the best athlete and he wasn't the best looking guy either.  He only had to things going for him - his persistence and his uncanny ability of take punishment.<br />Not only does it describe Foley's wrestling career, it delves deeply in his family and personal life, and describes the profession that is wrestling from a unique and accurate view.  Often, the audience only sees wrestling as entertainment, but Foley exposes it as a full-fledged business, with employees and decisions, with economic implications for each show.<br />What is most memorable about this book is Foley's descriptions of some of his most gruesome matches.  From getting slammed into razor wire and explosives, to tearing off half his ear, he captured my interest and instilled in me some respect for professional wrestlers.<br />The one complaint I have is that Foley kept describing match after match.  This paperback is over 700 pages long, and it could have been cut somewhat.  At about pages 300-500, the book becomes tedious and almost repetitve as he describes numerous wrestling contests that really didn't differ from other ones he describes. <br />Wrestling fans will love it to death, and non-wrestling will not be disappointed.	2001-01-01

Sam Spade, the archetype tough guy with street smarts, tries to solve the mysterious death of his partner, finds out the truth behind the constant lies of a beautiful woman, deals with the police breathing down his neck, and deals with some vile criminals.<br />This book grabs you with intrigue and one plot twist after another.  New characters, new leads and new ideas are all constantly introduced.  Is the innocent looking girl the most evil of them all, or was it the cheating wife?  Could the main character himself be a murderer?  What was the mysterious package?  Questions that lead to riddles that lead to more questions.  It's hard not to get caught up in this book.<br />Though the book doesn't really delve deep into any character, and the fluidity of his writing may cause you to re-read a paragraph or two, this book is a short, solid, mystery that should definitely be read.	2000-11-16

Orwell describes a Negative Utopia, one which Big Brother watches your every move, any inkling of dislike towards the party can get you killed, and even confessions of one's own children can send you to labor camps.<br />The first half paints a scary picture as one man tries to cope with everyday life in this suffocating hell.  There are telescreens constantly watching you, people totally dedicated to revising the past to suit the Party, spies out to snitch on you.  The main character, through his mundane everyday ordeal, breaks the mold and does something dangerous - buys and writes into a diary.  The overall feeling is a common but classic one - one man tries to break out of a confining society.  He describes the mood of the world that any man can relate to, being an individual in a world where individuality is not welcome.<br />The second half is the weaker half.  It turns from a subtle message to an openly overt message.  Instead of the concentrating on one man's perspective, Orwell bombards the reader with mock history and rhetoric, and a last minute confession by the Party itself.  That last minute confessions reminds me of how in any badly written movie, the villain suddenly explains his motives and his actions to the hero before he's about to kill him.  And like those movies, the motivation is overblown and totally unreal.<br />This book was enjoyable, and the writing was smooth and fluid.  The lack of dialogue and action sort of took away from the enjoyment, but not too much.  I would recommend this book, but I still think Animal Farm is far superior.	2000-11-16

Conrad, based on his own experiences, describes Africa as an educated European would at the beginning of the century.  <br />Unfortunately, it tends to portray Africans as savages, but it also shows the follies of Europeans dealing with them as if they were savages.  If this book were written in today's time, it would probably be considered racist.  Fortunately, that was not the intent.  It actually portrayed the Europeans as racists, elitists, and greedy.  It's an evenhanded book in its portrayals, but both sides are not treated kindly<br />The main point of this book is not a description of Africans, or Europeans, but of how the actually placement of one's self could affect someone's mind.  All throughout the book, Marlowe, the main character, wishes to meet up with the legendary Kurtz.  When he finally meets him, he discovers the insanity that a place like this could have on someone of such high stature as Kurtz.  It's highly reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.<br />Besides the unfortunate portrayal of Africans, the biggest grudge I have against this book is its language.  It takes about 50 pages to get the feel of his writing, but this book is only 96 pages long.<br />Though the language is rough, I would recommend this book.  Conrad describes the jungle unlike any author I can think of.	2000-11-16

I've finally found a book that does.<br />Knowing nothing about this book, I wanted to start this small classic and finish up in a few days.  Less than two hours later I wrapped this book up with my mouth wide open.  I could not believe how good a book could be.<br />Basically this book captures the flaws of communism and capitalism in a fantastic fairy tale about one farm rebellion and it's aftermath.

Pardon the clich&eacute;, but it works on all levels.<br />Basically, read this book.	2000-10-12

When trudging through the last three books of the Dune series, the only thing that I wished for was the end the of all this philisophical mumbo jumbo.  What about the action, character development, and the whole new world presented to us in the first Dune book?  Well, this book is everything I wished for and more.<br />Initially, I was a little weary of this book because it was prequel.  I later found out that this book exemplifies what a prequel should be.  All those great characters, groups, and kingdoms from Dune are in here.  It's a great novel in and of itself, but it re-energized my interest in the Dune series as well.<br />This book is very, very, fluid; unlike Frank Herbert's writing style.  Also, it's just bursting with action, interesting characters, and very interesting plots and sub-plots.  The story of Duncan Idaho is worth the hardcover price alone!<br />If you have read Dune, I highly recommend this book.  If you've read the whole series, you MUST read this book.	2000-10-12

In all fairness, I only got through half the book, but that's because if I continued, I would have wasted my time and tried my patience.  This book is incomprehensible, convoluted, and just plain horrible.<br />The major problem is that this books gets worse and worse by each chapter.  This is because a chapter requires that you know what happened in the previous chapter.  Since this book starts off pretty bad, it gradually turns into a foreign language by chapter 7.<br />Another problem is that the author also has no fluidity.  Compound this with the fact that this book is technical book, it makes reading one page a major chore.<br />Finally, the examples are just plain bad.  First, it requires the reader to be very familiar with Visual C++.  That's not all bad, but the examples presented rely on information that was badly presented, hardly presented, or not presented yet.  Also, the examples' explanations barely explain what the code does.<br />If you're like me, a programmer that was curious about OpenGL, avoid this book.  It's needless to say that my interest in OpenGL dwindled to nothing after trying to read this.	2000-09-25

Because the editor could have eliminated the first 700 pages of this 1028 page book, and it could have been a pretty darn good book. Since 70 percent of the book was useless, I feel that I should have only paid approximately 30 percent of the purchase price.  So Tom, feel free to wire me the money as soon as you can, with interest of course.<br />Anyways, besides wasting hours of my time, this book is borderline racist.  Clancy often compares the Chinese to Klingons, and is littered with the word Chink.  Even though these references somewhat fit in context, it could have been left out without hurting this book.<br />Another reason that why I didn't like this book was that in some aspects, it was too unreal.  Do Russians constantly talk about World War II in every other conversation?  Is every single Chinese cop and soldier a complete idiot?  <br />Finally, this book annoyed me.  Clancy switches between people, and refers to them in the stupidest ways.  It took me some time to realize that Jack Ryan, the President, was also code-named POTUS (President of the United States).  Also, there were numerous references to former Clancy books.  If you haven't read some of his other books, you could be like me and wonder if you've missed something.  Also, he loves into to go to technical details about weapons or software that just detract from the story.  I'm so sick of seeing military weapon names: AWACS, F-22s, any letter-any number, etc.  I found myself thinking that I'm reading a manual.  Basically, this books lacks fluidity and readability.<br />If you like a good story with interesting characters and international flavor, I suggest reading a James Clavell novel instead.	2000-09-25

It is as easy to read as any novel, explains everything neatly  and concisely, and provides excellent examples.<br />This covers what a mail  server does and how it works, but really concentrates on mail client-server  interaction.  It goes into SMTP, ESMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP, and vCard format.   The examples are clear and concise, and it includes actual code in Perl  and Java.  This provides the reader with excellent, platform independent  ways to do what they need to do.<br />The writing style is excellent.  One of  the most fluid technical books I've ever read.  In fact, all I needed was  one Sunday to read the book from front to back.<br />The code provided is  superb.  It's easy to use, easy to understand, and aides in the learning  process.  For me, the code is invaluable.  It has personally saved me  countless hours of work.<br />Finally, this book doesn't delve in tremendous  detail.  It tells the reader how to program for e-mail, but doesn't go into  the RFC's as much as many people would like it to.  I think, however, that  this is a real strength.  Many technical books bog the reader down with  irrelevant information.  This books avoids this, but still gives the user  information on how to retrieve any additional information if  needed.<br />Though there are not many e-mail programming books out there,  this is by far the best one.

It gives an excellent picture of the future, while  also presenting a great murder mystery.  From pedestrian highways, planet  colonies, robot-human conflict, to over-population, the future is presented  in a way that relates to modern society and modern problems.  This gives  the reader a greater understanding of the setting compared to most other  books.<br />The mystery itself is also very intriguing.  Who killed the  Spacer?  Would the human looking robot be accepted by his partner?  What  were the political ramifications of this murder?  All these problems become  apparent throughout this book, and makes the book even more interesting as  you read along.<br />I highly recommend this book, as it is one Asimov's  finest.	2000-09-10

Included are  the mysteriousness of the mob and their family values, and the ruthlessness  of Hollywood, which makes this book a fun weekend read.<br />The one weakness  is that the plot is lacking.  The main conflict between the two cousins  only comes to light near the end of the book.  Though the side plots are  interesting, the combination of it all makes it a weak overall story at  best.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book as one of those books to  read on a lazy day right next to the pool or on the beach.	2000-09-09

Well, like many who thought about buying this book, I watched Silence of the Lambs and read Hannibal.  Great movie, great book.  So, I decided to  check this book out.  Big mistake.<br />There's not really anything good about  this book.  This book is extremely outdated, really slow, and not very  fluid.<br />It's amazing how a couple of decades could improve someone's  writing style.  Black Sunday, in terms or readability, is not up to par  with many of the other books I have read.  Normally, I wouldn't comment on  this, but at some points it almost gave me a headache.  Maybe I was having  a bad week, but many sentances were very terse.  I'm not an English  professor, but let me give you an example.  Harris, describing a character  seeing a blimp up close for the first time: &quot;It was big.  Fasil was  reminded of his first view of an aircraft carrier.&quot;  Why didn't he say  something like, &quot;It's size reminded Fasil of the first aircraft  carrier he saw.&quot;?  Maybe I'm some type of picky freak, but when every  other sentance is written with extra small words (e.g. of, his, was, an),  and there are a lot of passive sentances, it kind of gets on your  nerves.<br />Adding to that is the lack of action and very little dialogue.  I  was reading about half as many pages per sitting as I usually do because of  this.  Except for the last twenty pages, the rest of the book could have  been condensed into about 50 pages.  Except for the details of Lander, the  book is full of boring side stories about peripheral characters and  annoying little details.  I personally never cared about how a helicopter  hoists roof parts or how a blimp works, but you'll learn it if you read  this.<br />Finally, this book is sort of outdated.  You can't fault Harris for  this, but it's worth noting.  Though it doesn't really show up in the book  (thankfully), the general plot (Middle Eastern terrorists trying to blow  something up) sort of prays on the fears of the zenophobic middle American.   It's a simple formula which I've seen many times, and has been done many  times.<br />So, if you're looking for another thrilling Hanibal Lector type  novel, it would be best to pass on this one.	2000-09-04

Random Threats from an Unarmed American	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A great left-wing political and social comedy	Most readers, like myself, probably don't share all of Michael Moore's  political beliefs.  This book is definitely left wing, but still will  appeal to almost anyone.  It crosses political lines by relying on one  thing that will be accepted by all: humor.<br />Moore attacks a wide group of  companies, issues, and people, but not maliciously, but more humorously.   Don't let that fool you though, his attacks are not light hearted.  He goes  after GM, Robert Dornan, Germany, and both political parties in a manner  that is shocking by its humor and its truthfulness.<br />Moore doesn't claim  to be a great writer, but his writing style reflects the way is - common,  and easy to understand.  This makes this book not only funny, but very  readable as well.<br />Though pretty short, it's hilarious, original, and even  provides some humorous pictures, mock trading cards, and mock articles.   Check this book out and you'll most likely enjoy it, no matter what your  political affiliation is.	2000-09-04

But  hey, at that time I found Who's the Boss interesting.  Now that I've  matured, and reread this book 10 years later, I realize that this book is a  true epic battle between courage of a man, and the forces of nature and  age.<br />Hemingway's greatest work, this 120 page novella can be easily read  in a single sitting.  In fact, it's more of a challenge to put it down than  to keep reading.<br />On the surface, this book is very touching and exciting  - a man struggling to win over great odds.  On a deeper level, it's a  representation of human courage, survival, and instinct in its greatest  form.  It is a true multi-dimensional book.<br />In other words, this is  greatest novella ever written.	2000-09-04

This book, which finally sums up what should have been  summed up in Speaker for the Dead (two books prior), does not capture the  imagination or hold the reader's attention as well as the first book in the  series.  In fact, this book, along with Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide  actually does a great disservice to Ender's Game. <br />The book is not too  bad though. It finally solves the riddles of the four species (Jane,  Piggies, Desaloda, and the Buggers), and moves along at a much better pace  than the two previous books.  Though the ending is relatively weak, at  least the reader won't have to endure more conflicts and problems that Card  seems to add on almost page by page.  It also tends to stray away from  family, philosophical, and religious rants and goes back to the story at  hand.<br />If you've read the three previous books, you should definitely  finish the series and pick up this book.  However, if you're just starting  out, start with Ender's Game, and end right there.	2000-09-04
US	49194495	R39YQ19U1BZ2GT	0684803356	896923	For Whom the Bell Tolls	Books	2	7	15	N	N	A long repetitive novel about a cave	I've read two other previous books by Hemingway.  Feel free to read those  reviews as well.  In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway  describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between  and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin).  In  another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful  portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences.   Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.<br />This  book, however, does nothing of the sort.  Excluding a side story that  concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and  provides little insight.  The majority of this 450 page book takes place in  one cave and provides very little substance.  Personally, no picture was  painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning  came from this book.<br />I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation  about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight,  unreal romance.  An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the  book would have not missed a beat.<br />If you're a casual reader like myself,  stick with other Hemingway works.	2000-09-04

It'll chew up your whole day because you won't be able to  put it down, but it'll be worth it.<br />It's basically about an adopted son  who takes the place of a murdered Don, and takes it upon himself to get  revenge against the murderers and save the Don's business.  Granted, the  plot is vary formuliac, but it still grips the reader like very few  books.<br />This book is not a literary masterpiece, but that really is a  blessing in disguise.  Puzo does a great job by not detracting from the  plot.  He doesn't concentrate on settings or development, but instead puts  all his effort in to telling a great story.<br />It's a great way to spend a  free day, and a fitting way to end Puzo's career.	2000-08-07

I was one of those guys that hated English class,  and believed Cliff Notes were a great substitute for the real deal.  That's  why it's out of character for me to recommend this book.<br />If anyone has  read my other reviews, I love plot, action, fluidity, and dialogue.  This  book is the exact opposite, but yet I loved it.  It takes about 50 pages to  get used to Hemingway's style (this is the first I've ever read any of his  books), but once accustomed to it, the amount of detail is  fantastic.<br />This book makes reader feel like they're in Pamplona, in the  bullfights, at the parties, and drinking the wines.  It's amazing.   Hemingway paints a picture of Spain that can not be matched.  The Spanish  tourism board should hand this book out instead of a standard  brochure.<br />Though the language style is a bit terse, and the plot is  almost non-existent, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2000-08-07

This book is a great journal of a marginal player for an expansion  baseball team.  It has got great stories, great gossip, emotional ups and  downs, and is an insightful read.<br />I, being so young (meaning desensitized  by today's culture), I found nothing truly shocking.  Though it must have  been pretty ground shaking in 1970, it's tamer than I thought it would  be.<br />It's a good book and granted it was the start of the trend that  exposes athletes and heroes and mere humans, but if it was released today,  most people would not have given it a second thought.	2000-08-07

I'm the type of guy that can't stand many literary classics.  I'm sorry, but I read a book for entertainment, not for metephors, meaning or symbolism.  This is why it seems strange that I highly recommend this  book.<br />This book chronicles the life of immigrants from Lithuania who  settle in Chicago in hopes of obtaining the American Dream.  The way  Sinclair describes the hardships of this family, it almost feels like  you're the one who's suffering.  Though depressing, the amount of detail  engulfs the reader.<br />Though the book is famous for exposing the meat  packing industry's unsanitary conditions, it really is just a minor part of  this book.  The worker's rights, the racism, the corruption, and the  poverty is what this book is all about.  Though I'm a firm believer of Adam  Smith and his invisible hand, half way through the book, I was searching  for the local Socialist recruiter.  Well, not really, but it will open  anyone's mind.<br />Except for the end, where it was just pure Socialist  propoganda, this book is fantastic.	2000-07-09
US	49194495	R3DCVU88IYDBWP	0812509250	4976316	Xenocide: Volume Three of the Ender Quintet	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A little better than the second book in this series.	Though the beginning looked like a continuation of Orson Scott Card's philisophical writings disguised as a novel, this book progress to a pretty  good book.  Though not as well done as Ender's Game, it's still intelligent  and well thought out.<br />Though Card continues his thoughts about religion,  family, and morality, much to the reader's chagrin, he finally moves back  to more action, plot, and fluidity.<br />This book deals with who has the  right to survice, something Speaker for the Dead failed to draw the reader  to.  There is no good or bad presented in this book, but instead it's a  battle of interpertation for what is right for humanity and the universe.   <br />One of the only real flaws of this book are the impossible ending, and  Card's reliance and constant explanation of his own psuedo-science.  A good  science fiction book must be believable at least.	2000-07-09

Like most people, after reading Ender's game, I rushed to get the next  book of this series.  Unfortunately this book does not do it's predecessor  justice.  I guess Orson Scott Card took a page out of the Dune series.  He  wrote a great initial book, and with that, trapped his readers into reading  his philisophical writings.<br />While the first book was outstanding with  plenty of action, humanity and supsense, this second book concentrated on  family, religion, and philosophy.  There were times when this book dragged  on and on with annoying side stories about a certain religous sect or a  family squable.<br />The book does start out well, and tries to present many  questions after the discovery of a new intelligent species: the piggies.   But before any of the questions could be answered, Card bulldozes the  reader with family and religous stories and philosopies that the reader  will probably never care about, thus separating the reader from the main  story line for many pages.<br />This book could have been condensed  considerably, but Card probably wanted to stretch this series out to a few  more books.  Financially, who could have blamed him?<br />Also note that this  is not a typical sequel in that it's not a direct continuation.  The action  occurs three thousand years later, and with a few additions and  alterations, it could have stood alone and not have been related to Ender's  Game at all.      <br />This book does end nicely, and through the fluff there  is an intelligent, well thought out plot.  However, don't expect to flip  through this book as quickly and as excitingly as Ender's Game.	2000-07-09

No need to go into real details here, as mostly everybody has sung the praises of this book time and time again.  Though it involves an alien war and space battles, this should not be classified as just a Sci-Fi  novel.  This book basically goes through Ender's very unique upbringing and  schooling, and how it fits with the future of mankind.  This should be read  by everyone, not just hard core science fiction readers.<br />I enjoyed every  aspect of this book, from the intriguing side story of Ender's brother and  sister, the struggle of Ender trying to survive in cruel conditions for a  child, to the alien civilization that threatens humanity's existence.  I  hate to sound cliched, but this book works on so many levels.	2000-07-09
