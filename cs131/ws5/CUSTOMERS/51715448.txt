The translation used (Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition) that allows me to read all 73 books of the Catholic Bible.<br /><br />2. The format (short opening quote from a Saint, Old Testament reading followed by New Testament reading) that allows each day's reading to be accomplished in just about 20 minutes.<br /><br />3. I also like the fact that it is just the Bible text itself without notes or commentary. Just straight forward and uncomplicated...which I think is what is needed for this type of devotional...other types of Bibles have thier place for thier purposes.<br /><br />There are blocks that you can check-mark to keep track of the days you have read if you choose to use them. Each day I've read leaves me feeling closer to God and gives me food for thought as I continue my day. An excellent resource for catholics who want to read the Bible in it's entirety as part of thier devotional practices...	2005-05-22
US	51715448	R135Q6JPEC8NOP	0898709504	238794611	Will Catholics Be Left Behind: A Critique of the Rapture and Today's Prophecy Preachers (Modern Apologetics Library)	Books	5	59	64	N	N	I was left reassured...	With so many people around me reading the \\"Left Behind\\" series, I wanted to find out what the Catholic understanding of the \\"Rapture\\" is. This book delivers in spades...<br />Mr. Olson begins with describing what the &quot;Rapture&quot; is as it is presented in the \\"Left Behind\\" books. Then he elaborates on the different kinds of dispensationalists, pre, post and a millennialism, as well as the differences between pre, post, and mid tribulationist.<br />He goes on to explore each of these and their logical (or illogical) conclusions. He traces the history of each train of thought and presents the historical Catholic position and response to these ideas, even outlining how a Catholic could be said to agree with different parts of each of the positions simultaneously yet not agreeing with any one position as it is understood by the predominately \\"fundamentalist\\" preachers who espouse them.<br />What I like about this book is the clarity in which he describes the Catholic understanding of eschatology and where that understanding comes from. Unfortunately I believe very few \\"joe-six-pack in the pew\\" Catholics understand the differences and for that reason I believe anyone (non-Catholics included) who has read the \\"Left Behind\\" series would benefit greatly from this well researched, even handed approach to other points of view.	2003-12-22

An engaging history lesson of both the Mexican-American War and the Anti-Catholic/Immigrant prejudice of Nativists and West Pointers who would later be made famous by the American Civil War. This is as much a story of persecution by bigoted officers as it is an Order of Battle for the conflict. All the major battles of the war are covered with maps and detailed first hand accounts of what happened.<br /> Well-educated and brilliant officers were of differing opinions about the legitimacy of the war, the treatment of German and Irish Catholics, and the tactics used on the field. It was surprising to me to read the correspondence of figures such as Grant, Lee, Sherman, Taylor, Scott, Bragg, and a host of others, illuminating their personal feelings on both sides of those issues and how the experience of the war changed the sentiments and conduct of many of those same officers. This would be reflected in the Civil War some 20 years later.<br />An intriguing example of the use of &quot;flying batteries&quot; as an innovative use of Artillery showed one of the reasons an outnumbered, and arguably out classed, military was able to defeat an enemy on foreign soil so far away from home.<br />The story revolves around the main character, the leader of the \\"San Patricos\\" and as a counterpoint, an established Irishman settled in the country and the Army. They both faced the same insults and persecutions, and the same offers and temptations to change sides and ironically, both men end up being promoted from enlisted men to commissioned officers in the two opposing armies.<br />I imagined at first that this would be a story of a man's internal conflict of having to choose loyalty to church over country; though a powerful theme of the book, this was not so much the case. The stronger case was made that the largest desertion rate in the history of the US Army occurred at a time when because of their nationality and religion, men were treated as less deserving of respect and dignity resulting in harsher treatment than \\"native born Americans\\". Punishments for identical infractions were much more degrading and humiliating for \\"foreigners\\" than for \\"Americans\\" in the same unit. A lesson in the effects of fair and equal treatment could not be stronger given to the American Army and indeed this did change. The disturbing part of this history is the undeniable cover up by first the Army and then the Government of the United States for over 120 years. This book should be on the required professional development reading list for Officers and NCOs alike.<br />Mr. Stevens writing puts emotion and personality to the characters and events described by using copious amounts of official Courts-Martial transcripts, Government Archives records of Great Britain, Ireland, Mexico, and the United States. In addition he draws from the personal diaries, journals, and letters, of the men and women involved. He also cites official war correspondence from the officers of both sides, and newspaper articles of the day.y resulting in harsher treatment than \\"native born Americans\\".

Mr. Crocker's writing style is easy to read yet highly literate. His story telling is exciting and fast paced. This book almost reads as an action/adventure novel rather than a textbook. The factual basis of his writing is thoroughly annotated in the bibliography (which could pass as a book in it's own right). I sensed the emotional highs and lows of the Church as I followed her through the journey of the past two thousand years. In the end though, I would not have been so inclined to use the title &quot;Triumph&quot;. Although he shows with great detail, reason and wit, the success of the Western World through the support and sacrifice of the Church, he equally illuminates how the Church was and continues to be reviled by her enemies in spite of the wondrous good she has done for mankind in preserving Classical Civilization. Once a beacon of light for the nations, uniting struggling states under the banner of Christ only to have those same sons of the Church rebel and break away. In the collective consciousness of man a profound example of the way to salvation, rejected by modern man as antiquated, repressive, superstitious, and out of touch with science and individual rights. Yes, Mr. Crocker glosses over some of the truly abhorrent abuses and scandals of the Church but not to the point of denying them or reducing their importance to history. He makes even more poignant the refusal of man to follow Christ instead of his own predilections. He shows the continuous thread of the wisdom of Christ's Church and her ability to predict the outcome of man's insistence on pursuit of self-interest.	2003-12-17

A refreshing analysis of current affairs in the Church. Written with brevity, clarity, and honesty. Not pandering to the &quot;politicized&quot; conservative or liberal &quot;factions&quot; of special interest groups within or outside the Church, he sets the picture in the framework of orthodox theology. He writes in simple language to express the complexity of the current crisis, avoiding &quot;knee jerk&quot; solutions. Time and again throughout the book he returns to the &quot;bottom line&quot;: a return to fidelity is the only real reform to be made.<br />He charges both the laity and the episcopate to not &quot;shy away&quot; from their responsibility...that includes teaching and living the fullness of Truth found in the classic Catholic Tradition.<br />If one looks at the Church as an &quot;Administration&quot; a &quot;Corporation&quot; or even a &quot;Denomination&quot;, then one has missed the essential truth of what the Church is, Who a Priest is, and the relationship of the faithful to each other and Christ through the Church. Mr. Weigel demonstrates the differences succinctly and incisively.<br />Yes, every Bishop, Cardinal and Priest should read this book as well as Seminary and Catholic University Rectors and Faculty. A very timely and thoughtful look at what can be done to &quot;re-form&quot; the Church if &quot;we&quot; only have the &quot;courage&quot; to try. Only the &quot;Truth&quot; will set us free.<br />To Quote his opening: &quot;For all those who will contribute to the genuinely Catholic reform of the Church in the United States. You know who you are.  Be not afraid.&quot;	2002-11-10

The first chapter opens with a Bishop explaining that the present crisis of a Priest shortage is a man made desire to abolish the traditional celibate all male Priesthood. Therefore, all men who are orthodox and stick to the official teachings of the Church are actually screened out by those in a position of power and influence in the deciding of who goes to seminary and who does not. Many of these vocations teams are led by liberal nuns who seek to bring about change from within.<br />Chapter Two concentrates on instances of outright dissent and contempt of many \\"mid-level\\" church officials, ordained and lay, that \\"screen\\" out potential candidates to the Priesthood who they fear may be too \\"rigid\\" and \\"immature\\" sexually because they do not support the ordination of women and they support the Church's views about homosexuality.<br />Chapter Three outlines the \\"The Gatekeeper Phenomenon\\". This pertains mainly to the teams of formation directors and Psychoanalysts employed by many Dioceses to ferret out abnormal behaviors and attitudes that may be detrimental to being a pastor of souls. Interestingly enough, many of the psychiatrists and psychologists are not supportive of church teachings and even label some candidates as \\"dysfunctional\\" and \\"immature\\" for holding on to traditional Church teachings.<br />Chapter Four addresses the Gay Subculture within the Clergy, Seminaries, and colleges. This chapter I found morally repulsive. If just 10% of the stories related are true, wow. What a sick and disgusting situation some of these seminaries face. It definitely reveals a homosexual agenda being promoted within the church. By those who are responsible for nurturing and forming new Priests. Absolutely incredible.<br />Chapter Five discusses Heterodoxy. This actually appears to me to be more dangerous than the homosexual problem as the gay subculture is just one part of the larger problem of dissent among our own.<br />Chapter Eleven goes back to explain more how the \\"Self-Fulfilling Prophecy\\" of the death of the Male Celibate Priesthood actually created an Artificial Priest Shortage.<br />The final Chapter Thirteen is perhaps the best for me because by the time I got to it I was exhausted from anguish. But, this chapter gives us hope that the ills of the past have been identified and certain remedies are in place, if not altogether accepted and implemented by all Dioceses in the United States.lf-Fulfilling Prophecy\\" of the death of the Male Celibate Priesthood actually created an Artificial Priest Shortage.<br />The final Chapter Thirteen is perhaps the best for me because by the time I got to it I was exhausted from anguish.

Kwashnak of Aug. 29th, 2001.<br />The book is an eye opening historical tour de force of Christian-Jewish relations. Had that been the real purpose of a tome this size, it would be required reading. I was disappointed to find the real purpose of the author's writing in the final section of the book. After revealing the good, the bad, and the very ugly history (that I believe every Christian should become better acquainted with), he then proceeds to outline his vision of what should be addressed in a &quot;Vatican III&quot;. He thinly vales his agenda in the name of anti-Semitism but, he enumerates all of the well known agenda items of a liberal-feminist theological ideal. I would rate this book with 5 stars had he been more genuine in his approach to healing the tragic scares of our relations with our &quot;older brothers in faith&quot;.	2001-09-03

Here are some of my comments about the portrayal of &quot;orthodox&quot; Catholic thought.<br />1) page#3, Chart#1: Good, second statement in the Block about Revelation is not  necessary in the presentation of &quot;orthodox&quot; catholic doctrine. We  simply call these people what they are, DISSENTERS. See Vatican II document  on Divine Revelation.  Last sentence at bottom of page about Mary can be  misleading to those unfamiliar with authentic Marian Dogma. See definition  of &quot;mediatrix&quot; in catholic pocket dictionary.<br />2) page#11,  chart#1: Good presentation of Liberation Theology,  Statement about RC  theologians in Latin America,(last sentence top block)should be stricken.  a) only a very few tried this  b) Pope John Paul II Squashed this  heresy in the early 80's  (See A&amp;E's biography of JPII)<br />3)  page#124(?)&amp;125(?), chart#80: O.K. but not quite correct, WE DO NOT  BELIEVE THAT CHRIST IS RE-SACRIFICED AT EACH MASS!  See  definition of &quot;Mass&quot; in Pocket Dictionary and the Catechism.  Participants column incorrect. Laity may recieve the Eucharistic Lord under  both &quot;species&quot;: Body and Precious Blood. (I do every  Sunday.)  There was a period when the Laity were restricted but that had to do with a  discipline imposed for health and abuse reasons rather than a Doctrinal  mandate. However, we teach that HE is truely and  completely present in  both &quot;species&quot;. See 1983 &quot;Code of Cannon Law&quot;.<br />I was  pleased to see in the Bibliography on page 144 that he does  make use of  Ludwig Ott's &quot;FUNDAMENTALS OF CATHOLIC DOGMA&quot;.
