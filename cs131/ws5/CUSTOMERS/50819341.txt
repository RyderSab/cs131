Two points made by two survivors. One: If it is for advanced civilization we strive then what can be said  about the Nazis?  The German country and government during that period was  one of the most advanced that the planet had ever experienced, yet it was  also the most barbaric. Lo that comment was made in ignorence.  Historically, every century is filled with Nazi-like governents that when  in a situation where they cannot be held accountable- let their whims run  amuck. (All in the name of fear, some god, patriotism or nationalism.)  And  two: nothing in the human experience, or the way humans react is going to  improve until there is a fundemantal change in the way man has been  created. This book may make you think, it may make you angry, but the point  is, even if you went through what these people went through: You may learn  something, but it won't be lasting; nothing's going to change. The book has  some tough messages.	2000-07-07

With a few interesting side trips.  Terrene Poppa comes across as a journalist on a quest, but the ending is preordained and the life--drugs-ect.-- (the  focus of his book) repititious.  Pablo Acosta (drug lord) comes from humble  beginnings and rises to power with violence and violence.  A lot of people  get killed, then more people get killed, and everybody is smuggling or  taking drugs and then Pablo gets killed.  The Mexican government in  corrupt, as are an assortment of Amercan agents, but the two groups play  the game, bad guys and good guys.  What the book lacks is the first person  power when something is written by somebody who actually experienced the  life.  Poppa is telling this tale from the outside, and while that suffices  it leaves the reader with a hazy vision of what really was happening.   Amazon thinks my reviews are partial and unfair.  They're probably right,  I'm too much of a critic.  If though you are interested in the subject  (drugs, mexico, trailer park violence) you can read this book.  It's not  bad, just didn't go the distance.  I think.	2000-06-26

I've never read any of Ellroy's books but I liked the movie LA Confidential.  I had seen a program featuring Ellroy and didn't think much of him...but he can write. In this book there is a huge  amount of violence/action, but so..so repetitious. And there are no good  guys. Really. I kept putting it down, picking it up, putting it down...  It's not horrible, but there's really nothing to reccomend it.	2000-06-15

America is a mystery.  But he worked on a coffee plantation from 1896-1906 and had set his eyes on cutting rubber to make some money. Going up the Amazon in a steam boat he finally arrived at the  mouth of the Xapuri and hooks up with seven men to cut rubber on contract.   A month longer up the river, in a canoe, with a guide, finds the group on  the banks of the Rio Acre trying to hack out a piece of jungle to make a  home. They cut rubber trees, bleeding them, as a fever begans to decimate  their ranks.  In two months Yungjohann is alone having buried all his  compadres. He struggles on, fighting animals and disease--He would find 18  foot boas sleepng on his chest when he awoke in the morning, which screemed  like cats when he moved...But did he make money?  No.  his supplies cost  him more than he made.  He went out again for eight months, with new men,  who also died. For ten years he perseverd in the wilds of the Amazon.  The  men he met, what he learned in the jungle and camps makes for reading found  in no other book.  This is the man's diary. IT'S TOO SHORT!	2000-06-13

A FORM OF SLAVERY THAT WAS PRACTICED IN THE UNITED STATES  THOUGH NEVER EXPOSED.  ROBERT GREW UP UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES REMINISCENT OF  ANTEBELLUM TIMES AND THE TWISTS AND TURNS HE HAD TO ADAPT TO WERE  EXTRAORDINARY.  WHAT THIS MAN WENT THROUGH AND OVERCAME INSPIRES GREAT  HOPE. THAT HE ROSE TO BE, WHAT HE BECAME: A MAN WITH FEET OF STONE, IS A  WONDERFUL, YET LITTLE KNOWN STORY.  I'M PROUD THAT THIS MAN WAS A PART OF  THE HUMAN RACE.  TREMENDOUS ACTION, DRAMA AND INSIGHT.	1999-12-13

IF YOU READ FIVE PAGES YOU'RE HOOKED. REALLY CUTS TO THE CHASE AND DESCRIBES THE LIFE, TIMES AND AGENDAS  OF THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THAT ERA. 2-3 THOUSAND YEARS AGO.  HISTORY  BEING WHAT IT IS, NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT THEY READ IN BOOKS  ANYHOW, AND YOU HAVE TO TRUST THE AUTHOR, VAN LOON'S OBSERVATIONS ARE  SCHOLARLY AND HUMANIST YET HE DOESN'T PREACH TO THE READER. FUN BOOK TO  READ AS IS IT'S CLOSE COMPANION &quot;TOLERANCE&quot; BY THE SAME AUTHOR.	1999-12-13

WHEN IT BLOWS I FEEL IT AND MUST OBEY.  AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I TRY NOT TO THINK AND SIMPLY FOLLOW MY INSTINCTS.&quot;  ACTUALLY, HE ALWAYS TRIED TO  TAKE THE PATH THAT HELD THE PROMISE OF BEING MORE FUN AND LESS RESTRICTIVE  TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE, (NOT EXACTLY A CRIME) IN PLACES WHERE WHITE MEN  GENERALLY HAD THE UPPER HAND AND LORDED IT OVER THE LOCALS. - HIS TRAVELS  AND PERSONAL ADVENTURES BEGINNING AS A FORRESTER IN AFRICA, SO. AMERICA;  WITH SIDE TRIPS TO OTHER LANDS...MEXICO, EUROPE AND THE HINDU KUSH IN  AFGHANISTAN.  NOT A DEEP STORY.  THE DON IS RATHER PROUD OF HIMSELF.  HE  WAS INVOLVED IN MANY ENDEAVORS AND WAS ALWAYS TOO BUSY AND SELF-INDULGENT  TO HAVE A FAMILY, I THINK THAT ALWAYS BOTHERED HIM; THOUGH HE ALWAYS HAD  TIME TO LIVE WITH WHATEVER WOMAN WAS AROUND. GREAT FIRST PERSON STORY.	1999-12-13
