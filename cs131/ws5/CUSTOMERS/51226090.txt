What caught me eye about this book was the reviews... and it mentioned the Trial of Job is an intriguing, modern-day adaption on the biblical Book of Job. Well you know that review is what drew me in. This is Chitwoods first novel; and what a surprise. This story kept me coming back each day trying to finish it. It has courtroom shenanigans and unscrupulous lawyers and heart wrenching spirtual dilemmas. The Trial of Job has it all. This book will make a good book club selection. This drama weaves a drama so realistic and rich in detail... you will think that you are reading from the front pages of todays's newspaper. If you have the chance to get any book this year, you should get this one; even if you have to order it from your favorite book store or online<br />I must say some of the top 500 reviewers of Amazon missed this one. To tell you the truth, I almost did also. I can only hope and wait for the next one. Readers you want be disappointed in this great find.<br />TRIPP	2001-12-03

Its part survival story, part chase, part romance and part medical thriller. But it all works really well. Kier is a Tilok Native American veterinary doctor who mixes mordern medicine and more traditional remedies and as a result is very popular in the local community. Basically a peaceful guy who is forced to turn to violence in order to deal with a character called Tillman. Everyone chases everbody through the woods, but this chase is not boring at all. Conveniently Tillman is a world class hunter. Once the action starts the book becomes a real page turner. Most readers will be captivated by the story. This is one read that is good at anytime.

All I will say is&#8230; this book keeps you guessing all the way until the last page. Some of you know of Finder&#8217;s works and know how good he is, but for those of you who do not&#8230; then there is no time to waste. Mr. Finder&#8217;s work, and he only has written 4 books, are becoming hard to find. This book was first published a while ago and reissued. My good reader you must not hesitate, and you must rely on my good faith as a reviewer that this guy is good&#8230; real good. I have ordered his first thriller, The Moscow Club, from old book dealers on the web. There are even rumors that Mr. Finder has a new thriller upcoming, but I have no knowledge of this. There are many people waiting for a Finder thriller, including me.<br />I recommend all of Mr. Finder&#8217;s work; ZERO HOUR, HIGH CRIMES. Also, when you see his books, buy it. You will be surprised at how good Joseph Finder&#8217;s books are. Please be assured that these books will be some of your best reading at anytime.

His wife is mad as heck at  him, and he can not figure out why. Then things gets worse. His retired author wants to make a comback in a new genre. The sweet young asistant down the hall is starting to look good to Jonathan. And someboy is sending an anonymous manuscript to him with the manuscript... which seems to resembles his life.

I did not give this a rating of a 5, because it dragged in some spots. This book has a powerful protagonist who rejects any notion that he is crippled. The audience will not pity Lincoln because they will admire his intelligence and fortitude. The Empty Chair contain a fast moving polt and a wonderfully developed cast of heroes and villians. The romance between teacher and pupil is beautiful and a realistic truimph of the human spirit. But what really knocks me out about this book is the author always have you wanting this story never to end. I must tell you that Deaver has a gift that many authors do not have. He is truly the best suspense/thriller writer around.<br />This is a good story folks...go out and pick up; you want be disappointed. Oh yeah...do not forget to click a YES for this review.

The TRIAL delves into the life of a 56-year old attorney appointed to defend a young man accused of murder. The Trial is happening on two fronts: in the courtroom and in the heart of the defense counsel, Kent McClain. This book has humor, romance, intrigue, and spirtual truth. I would say the Trial has writing styles of such authors as Grisham and Baldacci. Whitlow's two books stands out among anyone in fiction today. I cannot wait for more titles from him. I also recommend TWO great stories for readers, which are The Great Divide by T.Davis Bunn and Stone Ponies by Tom Willard<br />Thanks for a helpful yes on this review.<br />TRIPP	2001-04-16

In this fourth book, Willard takes on the horror of the Vietnam war. The story seems to be more edgey. The edge in this story is probably because Willard is a highly decorated paratrooper. The characters comes off as real people. And because TW has witness war firsthand, it really shows in the writing. TW deals with issues peculiar to blacks in the military with insight and compassion. This is a history lesson told in an adventurous, dramatic and sometimes a funny way. TW next book deals with a member of the Sharp family in Desert Storm.  Those of you who have not read the Sabre Chronicle need to check out this great story for the first time. I recommend you start from the first book named Buffalo Soldier, then The Sable Doughboys and later the Wings of Honor. This story will not disappoint; guaranteed !!!!	2001-03-20

I would also say for those of you who are lawyers, this story may make for some,good and interesting reading. There are some big issues in this new political thriller, such as abortion, the right to privacy, the politics of scandal, special interest groups and etc. What really follows here,is a constructed effort to debate on late term abortion in the courts and the political arena. This story is a thinking person's novel with total concentration here. The story starts out fast and ends up a struggle to finish. I was told that Degree of Guilt by RNP was a better read. You will be hooked on his writing style, but this story was not enough for a rating of 4 to 5.  But a 3 rating is good enough for me to give one of RNP older books a try.<br />Tripp	2001-03-09

The author was interviewed and it was thought by some in the literary world that this book was autobiograpical. He used his name in it and has insisted the story is fiction.

The bottom line is the book was just like Book #7 far slower but The Mark (#8) has it moments. I wish the story would have moved a little faster. The authors have a gold mine, but they are pushing it a little to make 12 Book Series. These last two installments, #7 and #8, seems to run out of gas. Do not get me wrong,I was among the first to buy this installment, and I do enjoy the series, but these books are gripping because of the suspense, not always because of a great writing ability or plot. On the other hand,I must also say, Jenkins and Lahaye, that, there has not been alothappening in all of these 381 pages. Suspense with cliffhangers and character development should be explored for the next installment. The character named Annie for instance could have been expanded in her development, but it was not. I will certainly read the nextinstallment, but give me something for those next 381...plus pages.	2000-12-06

I will be the first to say I did not read it right away and I waited until now. I read 100 pages the first day I picked it up. It is that good. And you know I am not a fast reader. I found this in the Christian Fiction Section of my favorite bookstore. I read the back cover and I was sold. You should not be fool by the label of the book being christian fiction, because this story read like any Grisham book; maybe a better read than Grisham. The story is about Renny Jacbson expecting to recieve a fat inheritance, but becomes surprise that it does not happen. This sounds like The Testament from Grisham, but I assure it is not. In fact Jacobson recieves a special list of names holding an investment company which involves him. When Jacobson meet the members of the list and discovers the staggerring value of his father's mysterious bequest, he must decide to.... I can't give it away but the first 100 ask you to turn faster. Again I assure you this is a winner and the suspense is enough to keep you glued to your easy chair until you finished. Don't let Christian Fiction stop you on this one.

I struggle with the reading of this book; my interest wandered. Maybe two books a year for the Left Behind Series publishers was a little much. Too much money for the publisher to consider going slow, I guess. Most authors can only get out a book once a year. It was my greatest fear the authors would get sloppy. In the last few installment to come, they should look at the quality of the story instead of the quantity to put in the stores. Let this review give you this caution; it was not a knock out this time like the others in the series. I will continue with the series until the end.

At one time about 2/3 way through the book I thought I had the answer to the puzzle, but J.P. proved me wrong. I suggest you go out and buy the book before his new Alex Cross book comes out, Roses Are Red. James Patterson so far has referred to the other Alex Cross books in each new story, so beware.

As soon as you seem to have it all figured out, JP throws you a curve. It is drama at it best that will grab you and won't let you go until the end.

This is strictly action on a higher James Bond level with the roughness of Pitt from Clive Cussler. If you like adventure with the familar ending, go and get Dubrul.

They were two snipers in the Russian  Army out the get the Headmaster Sniper in the German Army in World War II.  The story is based on some true fact of this war.

You might say it has romance, violence, and technology. But the story has too many subpolts for the average reader to follow through until the end. A good reader or a  constant reader would probably enjoy this type of writing. I found this  story somewhat difficult to follow with all its characters. Each chapter  jumps back and forth among the story line. It make a good story a slow  story in my opinion. In J.D. first book, Vulcan's Forge, the villian was  Ivan Kerikov. <br />I am here to tell ya, Kerikov is back in this installment  in Alaska. Kerikov joins forces with a renegade Arab oil minister to  control the supply of oil. The Main character as we know, Phillip Mercer,  saves the day and again get the girl, Aggie Johnson. Kerikov's fate  was......well I can't tell ya here. I recommend this book, even if I say  its a difficult read, you must read it for yourself. This is pure adventure  like the famous Dirk Pitt character in Cussler's novels. <br />Overall with  its difficult writing style flaws, I give it a 4 1/2 to 5 stars.

This book was recommened years ago to me and other soldiers by a the Post Cdr, Thomas A Schwartz. He recommended this book as required reading by all his officers and noncommissioned officers. At the time, on or about 1994, I  did try to obtain a copy of this book and I did find an old copy. I found  it a difficult book to read. I truly did not understand the value of the  words written. You know, I put it down after about 200 pages and I would  have trashed it, but I didn't. When I became a First Sergeant in the Army,  I remembered this novel and I thought it would help in my leadership style  as well as show me things I should not do; and I gave it a second try.  Anyway, the general said it help him, but could I apply it to me as noncom.  I did get pass 200 pages but I did not finish this giant book. The story  revolves around the respect for a soldier and how they should be treated.  This is a great idea for civilians to read also. The story conveys the idea  that all soldiers and people must be informed by talking to them, showing  some sensitivity to their needs, and providing some predictablity. The  story cause me to think about how leaders are in the military. My book was  lifted by a low life  and I was glad to see it in reprint in HC. I will  make this remarkable novel, its engrossing story, and the sheer excitment  and a overwhelming account of the 20th Century War a part of my personal  library.  Oh, by the way I did finish the book this time and I must say,  difficult read or not, you, the reader should not pass this huge story up.

A friend of mine recommended his newest book Atlantis or this one and I picked this one. CC is a great adventure writer. The book is suspense  driven. I read this book in 2 days flat. It is a record for me. Don't pass  this blockbuster up if you are a fans of adventure. Dirk is the classic  hero who gets the girl in the end. My friend also recommended Du Brul's  Charon's Landing. Don't forget a YES or NO Helpful to the review and check  out my other reviews; you won't be sorry. A great story is only a click  away.<br />Great fun in reading this book I hope Atlantis is just as good.	2000-06-28

If you like bio/high tech thrillers, then this book is good as it gets. I have put Mount Dragon in my home library. DP and LC always provide  the best in a good suspense story. I think you will not be  disappointed.<br />Enough said here and enjoy. Their next novel is THE ICE  LIMIT; it comes out July 2000. I read a preview chapter on their DP &amp;  LC web site. Its going to be a good one !	2000-06-09

If you are tired of Mack Bolan and the others, try Cliff Garnett&quot;s new series out for awhile. This first book is very well-written, ingeniously polted,  fast-paced and credible; The TALON Forced is an elite special force with  personnel from all branches of the armed services. They used the latest in  cutting-edge technology and firepower. There stealth camoflauge is ......  ,well, let me just say this, get the book to find out, or just to  comprehend this one. Talon Force never lets up until the last page. This is  a good one. <br />Come back next time for my next review on my review page.  MELTDOWN IS NUMBER #2 IN THE SERIES. You should look for it.

Brooke Stephens has written a book which is a presentfromheaven. I bought this book... some time ago; what asteal. Anyhow, I thought it was like the Suzie Orman's book, but once I started to read this book, I notice there was something different here. It was a simple day to day plan for personal growth as well as personal finance. The financial guide is not a get rich book but the book is for those of us who truly do not understand finance. BS book could also help the knowlegeable finance manager out there. I must tell you this, I have read only 100 pages and I already must say it is worth 10 stars. This book has drove me to pencil in notes in the margins. The booksellers have not given this book a top spot in their stores, and I must say, I wonder WHY. Good people, please, do not pass up this book if you are interested in making your finances better. Wow, enough said here, but do not forget to come back and check out my next review.<br />Personal Finance Books are no sure thing for riches, but this BOOK is not just good, but VERY GOOD !	2000-05-24

Cussler is still tops in adventure stories, but DuBrul does shine through here. The story does capture the reader's attention from the word go. I beleive DuBrul does have  a future in writing. The main character is Phllip Mercer, a geologist, who  got the skills to fight villians, the brain of a detective, and a body to  hold liquor. Oh, by the way, he seems to be able to get the girl in the end  as most heroes do. One of the lines in the book is when Mercer is talking  to a damsel in distress is, &quot;WHAT'S YOUR NAME... SHE ASK MERCER. MOST  DAMSELS CALL ME LANCE A. LOT, BUT YOU CAN CALL ME MERCER. MERCER SMILED AND  THE GIRL REWARDED MERCER WITH ONE OF HER SMILES RIGHT BACK!  Good times for  Mercer at the end of the story. In most stories of adventure the villian is  always captured, but in VF, the villian is ........ I can't give it away,  but go get the book. The second novel, featuring Mercer, is Charon's  Landing. Come back next month for my next review.<br />On this being Dubrul's  first time out,I was impressed. Charon's Landing has my dollar	2000-05-11

I understand his previous books are also very good. I decided that I would not read this story until the movie came out on video. To my surprise, I should have  started this exciting thriller right away. J.D. hooks the reader on every  chapter. I would surely go out and buy the next Lincoln Rhyme's novel by  this gifted writer. This whodunit novel give no clues until the end. The  buildup of events keeps you reading well into the night; so beware if you  have to go to work. The person in this story who commited all the crimes  was ....... well let me say you will be surprised just as I was. The next  Lincoln Rhyme's novel out is THE COFFEN DANCER and J.Deaver,s third  installment on the Lincoln Rhyme saga will be THE EMPTY CHAIR. If you like  mystery you will love Jeffery Deaver. Readers of good suspense and mystery  will want to take a good look at this book.<br />The last comment on this is  &quot;A GREAT MYSTERY STORY ! &quot;	2000-04-24

I struggled with the first 180 pages, and I had to let it fly to the trash can. I guess some people loved it. It was not worth it in my opinion. I would say that when the first  book, of an author, does not come out in hard back first, the publisher  does not have confidence in the product. I may say, at first, this book was  moving along. It kept my interest all the way up to page 133. The main  character, Ashley, the team leader, was doing very well. Then all of a  sudden, JR made the adventure go deep underground. It dragged, and dragged.  Weak characters blew it for this book. I understand JR next book will be  EXCAVATION; due out JULY 2000. I will not look for this book guys. His new  one will have to drop in my lap at the book store.<br />Last words to you is,  &quot; borrow SUB from your buddy,&quot;.	2000-04-09

I get the feeling Mr Grisham is trying to branch out in other the directions in this story. What a grand idea for the character to show a more human face. The main charcter  look for the daughter of a recently died Troy Phelan; a self-made  billionaire. But get this, the daugther does not want her  money. She  chooses to give her life to God and walk away from the mordern world and  .... You got to read it for yourself. This is a remarkable adventure. Score  another one for JG.  This is a sure 6 or 7 stars if possible. I wonder will  the recently book release, The Brethren, be this good. In my book the  PARTNER by JG is as good as the TESTAMENT.

A year ago or so, I visted AMAZON for bestsellers in other parts of the world and found Left Behind. And so far I have bought each installment of the story one by one. The U.S. mainstream was not on board then, but the  mainstream started to take notice. I guess huge sales in the Christian  Bookstores and request for the books in the mainstream stores got this  money making story alot of attention in 1999. This story is based on the  Bible story of Revelation. It is Jenkins and Lahaye who make this story  come alive for all groups of people. You should not missed the next  installment. And if you consider reading the books, I recommend YOU begin  with LEFT BEHIND. The books, in my opinion, are not stand alone stories. IF  you want to read a super good story, DON&quot;T MISS the LEFT BEHIND  SERIES. These guys had a brilliant idea to bring this story to the public  through the novel art of fact and fiction; and I say BRAVO. My hope would  be that the authors don't get sloppy, but maintain good story quality.<br />A  SUPER STORY FOR ALL TIME !	2000-03-03

But after seeing the movie, you will want to read the book; trust me. The movie left out so much. N.S. has a real touch for making the reader feel warm and fuzzy. Women will love  this novel better than men, I think. HEY,GO FIGURE! Overall the book was  not bad, but this book is the only Sparks book for now. My dollars go for  Action-and-adventure.

But my luck was with me and I found it at the local library in the new arrival section; so I checked it out. I found this book to be a quick  paced read, but not fast  paced. I would say for an author who is a Colonel it was steady reading and  I wanted to always get to the next chapter. The Colonel  would alway try to  leave a slight cliff-hanger at the end of each chapter. You do not have to  be military man or woman to enjoy this book. You will love it. If people do  not pick this book up, you will be sorry ! . SO GO OUT AND GET IT, DON'  WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK. THIS BOOK OF FICTION IS A GOOD BEGINING FOR THE  COLONEL.

I thought this was a good idea for a book from the back cover write up. But once I started reading this stuff, it got tiresome quick.Do not be confused, it is a tough read. Too much bouncing  around when the main character talks. Too much explaining. I am thinking,  why don't the author move this along. For a total of 264 page HC, I thought  I would finish this in a hurry, but instead I put it down. I would say to  all who thinks about buying this, you take your own risk !  My copy of this  book goes to the book traders for something more interesting to my taste.  Your money is better spent on the paperback or something good.	1999-11-20
