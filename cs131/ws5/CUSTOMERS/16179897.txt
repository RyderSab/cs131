I am sure that I am going to get a lot of negative votes for my poor review but I just can not believe that I read the same book that other people rated 5 stars.<br /><br />If I could give this book 0 stars I would.  This book was so bad, the wrting so juvenille that I could not get past page 54.<br /><br />Usually no matter how bad the book I usually finish reading it  but not this one.<br /><br />The dialogue was pitiful.  Here's an example, Jason meets a woman in a restaurant.  After some meaningless small talk he asks her does she want to dance?  Huh!!!! He told her that he uses the word dance for many different things.  What he was asking was would she like to have lunch with him.  Again all can say is huh???  Next his exwife comes in.  She wants him back.  He tells her that he can't talk right now because in a minute he will have tears running down his face and how back when he received the divorce papers he was so distraught that he fell to the floor and nearly passed out. Not exactly in idea of a sexy cop.<br /><br />If none of what I wrote makes makes sense its because the writer story didn't make much sense.  I just kept thinking that real people do not speak in such a bizzare mannar.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.  I also agree with anohter reviewer that the constant designer name dropping was very annoying.	2005-06-22
US	16179897	R1VE2F372LR2S7	158314482X	681025874	After The Storm	Books	4	11	11	N	Y	Sometimes the end can become the beginning	Jessi has been  married to Derrick for 10 years and is the mother of twin boys.  For most of her marriage she has had doubts about Derricks fidelity but never had solid proof or rather she refused to look for solid proof.  One morning she hs a feeeling that something bad is going to happen.  When she hears that Hurrrican Lily is going to hit her town she believes that it is the cause for her uneasy.  She was wrong.  She goes to her husbans business and catches him with his new employee.  Her world is changed forever.  Making matters worse is her mother.  A woman who has never in Jessi's 33 years been supportive of anything in her life and is quick to assume that Jessi is once again at fault.<br /><br />Luckly for Jessi shs has the love and loyality of two dear friends; Karen and Regina.  They never judge her and have her back.  A unique all girl vacation and some serious soul searching and the support of her friends allows Jessi to move on with her life and win back her much battered self-esteem.<br /><br />I liked the story but I didn't love it.  The biggest problem that I had with the story was that it was too short. Ms.  Bell wrote very short chapers and tended to skip over blocks of time; sometimes by several months.  I would have liked to read more about Jessi's coping with her separation and spend more time with her boys.  The affect of the separation on the boys was never mentioned.  I think that it should have been.  Ohe day the twins are living in their own home with two parents and the next thing they know their parents are not together and don't even speak each other.<br /><br />What earned this story 4 stars was that Jessi's journey to emotional and financial suscess didn't revolve a man.<br /><br />She didn't need to have a new man in her life to rediscover her self worth.	2005-06-19

Ms. McKayhan wrote a story that was wonderfully written.  This is the kind of story that I love to read.  The characters were interesting and well written.  I liked that their story was told in the first person. Each woman had her story to tell but the main story was one of real sista friendship.<br /><br />On the surface Reece had it all, a good job as a lawyer and a sucessful fiance.  However, she can't or won't commit to a wedding date.  She knows that she should be happy.  Many women wolud love to have the life that she has.  So why isn't she happy?

I rarly give a book a 5 star rating but without a doubt this was one of the best books that I've ever read.  I look forward to more from Ms. McKayhan.	2005-06-12
US	16179897	R26028AUFQX3LP	0440206251	665653781	Tempted	Books	1	21	36	N	Y	Too vulgar for me..... and poorly written....	I read romance and some erotic but this was neither.  The language was crude and just plain nasty.  When I read romance I do not want to read about gential piercings, ivory sex toys and constant near rapes of various women.  I especially do not want to read about brutal sex scenes between the hero and heroine. The sex scenes were not hot or erotic to me they were just crude and nasty.  When did Ram and Tina have time to fall in love?  Was it during his never ending insults and harsh treatment of Tina or was it during her ploting against him?  I didn't not like Ram or Tina they were not in any way shape or form endearing or likable chacters.  I didn't care about what happended to them.  If they both fell off a cliff I would say good riddence!  The story was poorly written. It reminded me of a story that couldn't make it on the big screen and went straight to video.  Also when I read romance I don't want to read about the hero having rough sex with the heroine because he thought she was loose and was mad that she didn't get hot for him because after all he was a wh*%emaster or some such garbage.  There was nothing hot or erotic or romantic about this story.  This is the first book that I felt the urge to toss in the trash.	2005-06-02

I am big fan of paranormal romance; especially vampire romance novels.  I couldn't wait to start this book.  Maybe if I had not just finsihed Night Play by Sherrilyn Kenyon I might have rated the book 4 stars but on the heels of such a fantastic story the flaws in my Demon's Kiss were too obivious.<br /><br />I will not summarize the story others have already done a good of out lining the plot.  I did like that Simons killing wasn't sugar coated and that he wanted to be human again.  I liked Isabel a little.  She wasn't as interesting as I like heroines to be.  However, I know that this was part of the story.  Her father kept her ignorant about the mysteries of the catacombs and the scrolls hidden within them.  Simone and Isabel had a medium chemistry.  I think that it was circumstances that drew them together rather that genuine attraction.  I mean Isabel had never had any contact with men other than peasants.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the story was the anitclimatic ending.  I can't really go into details without revealing too much of the story.  I will say that half way through the story it really picked up and I started to enjoy it.  The mystery of the druid's writings and Isabels role in Simons quest was really orginal.<br />But then after all this build up about her role in Simons quest and her bravey in saving Simone life, she ended up being the helpless victim.  Maybe Ms. Blue next novel will continue the story of Isabel and Simon.  There is definitly a link between Simon and Tristan Dumaine the vampire of her next story.	2005-04-21

Ambers family dramas were off the hook!  Her mother Paula was crazy and as the book progressed she moved from a selfish skank to a cruel child abuser.  This part of the book was fantastic.  You could really feel for Amber and wonder how any woman could be so heartless towards her children.  Amber suffered more than her older sister and baby Renee.<br /><br />Instead of keeping focused on Amber and her family Ms. Bellamy kept swiching chapter by chapter to other characters.  This is were I have the biggest complaint.  The book jacket description is very misleading.  Amber has little to no contact with Shelia the mother of four, Reba the mother of six or Lucy the college grad single.  There was never any interaction between Amber and these women.  It was if Ms. Bellamy was telling several different stories at once and there was no real connection or realistic link between the stories.<br /><br />The book would have been excellent if Ms. Bellamy would have stayed focus on Ambers family.  In particular Renee's dad Horace.  He was a character that deserved so much more time.  Instead too much of the story was spent on Sheila's live in help Lenora, her part time baby sitter Pam; Horaces baby sitter Emily and her relationship with Jared; Lucy's wirlwind romance with Kevin and so on and so on and so on........All these other people were destracting.<br /><br />However, Ms. Bellamy is a talented writer and I will give her future works a chance.	2005-04-11

So far I've only given two books a five star rating.  One was a romance novel.  Something Wonderful was delightful! I won't summarize the story because others have already done a great job of it already. I will just tell you how much I enjoyed this book.  I loved Michael!  He was a perfect hero.  He didn't meet the typical romance hero requirements. He wasn't rich, arrogant, or English noblity. Nor was he a \\"noble crook\\" forced into a life of sin because of an unfair society.<br /><br />Michael was unique and to me the perfect hero because he was so real.  He cared about his family, neighbors, friends, animals and strangers.  Whatever he had he was willing to share.<br /><br />I also liked Timona.  She was also atypical.  She was a heiress but she accepted being rich as a part of who she was.  She was open, honest, and smart.  I liked that she didn't try to play mind games with the hero.<br /><br />Their attraction to each other was loving and passionate.  They had fantastic chemistry both physically and mentally.  I liked how they really talked and shared who they were.<br /><br />The story wasn't loaded down with mind games and other love interests.  It was simply a powerful love story of two lovable characters.<br />Sensuality rating 3 out of 5.	2005-04-10

I loved the first three and rated them all 4 stars.  The Chase will be the first book that I've rated three stars.<br />The story of Seonaid and Blake lacked the humor and passion that I've come to expect from one of her novels. The Chase basically lived up to its title.  Blake spent most of the novel chasing Seonaid over Scotland.  Blake didn't want to marry her and it took him 8 long years and an order from the king of England to finally make him collect his bride.  She was 24 and he could have married when she was 16.  Only when he got around to it she was gone and that's when The Chase began.  I did like Seonaids unconvential upbringing.  She was raised like a son.  She could handle a sword and take care of herself.<br /><br />Overall, the book was just okay.  I just think the story wasn't very interesting and I kept expecting more chemistry and get to know you moments between Blake and Seonaid.<br />Sensaulity rating 3 out of 5.	2005-04-10

In realilty she has been out of work for a year and can't pay her bills.  Oh yeah on top of that she hasn't had a date in a year.<br /><br />Enter Maxwell Ferguson a self made millionaire who really keeps his finger in all his money making pies.  He is the repo man and tried to take Dariens car.  She does what she does best to save her ride.  She runs her game on him and it works.  Not only does she get to keep her car but gets a new job nad a chance to do things right.<br /><br />The job is in Georgia her home state and where her three older and jealous sisters live. It is also where Max runs his family business and his family lives.<br /><br />For Darien this is a new beginning and she plans to take full advantage of it the right way.<br />Max is attracted to Darine but really only had honorable intentions towards her.  They have fantastic chemistry together and some steamy love scenes.<br /><br />I really liked this book and the only thing I didn't like was Max's sister.  I may not be from the South but pleezze! Max he was the oldest and if it wasn't for him none of siblings would be sucessful and rich. Doreetha couldn't have been more that 33 or 34 but the way she tried to run Max and everyone else you would think she was the grandmother, aunt or eldest sister by 10 or more years.  The scene in the kitchen when Darien made a pie and wanted to help with Sunday dinner was annoying.  Also the way the reat of the family always had to add thier two cents was<br />more story time taken away from Darien and Max.<br /><br />However, other than annoying family members it was a fun and sexy read.	2005-04-04

This was my first Mary Balogh novel and it will be my last.<br />The idea was interesting.  Kit plans to woo and wed Lauren who he has never met because he needs a proper bride to spite his father who wants him to marry a woman that was once engaged to his brother.  This plot was quickly revealed and then Lauren hatches her own idea.  In exchange for a summer to remember Lauren will pose as his intended and help repair his relationship with his remaining brother and his parents.  I liked Kit he was an interesting hero but I did not like Lauren.  She had been describe throghout the book as boring, poper and a true lady.  Well at the end of the book she was still a boring poper lady.  There was no logical reason why she kept refusing to marry Kit and her constant refusals were so annoying.  The only difference being that now she had had a couple of mild adventures and some boring sex.  They lacked chemistry; that connections that makes a romance couple really click.  There was no sparke or sizzle and I jsut didn't get how they or why they fell in love.  They only reason I could see was that they were the hero and heroine and that's what they were suspose to do.<br /><br />In addition, the story was so drawn out and long.  I was just plain bored.  There were too many other characters and too much time was spent naming names and family ties.  I kept think what's the point! I also think that this book was used too much to introduce the characters for her Slightly series.  From what I read of the characters I will am not even Slightly interested.<br />Sexuality rating 2.5 out of 5.	2005-03-30

While the are eluding the men who want to capture and or kill her Nigel helps Gisele heal the emotional wounds that her cruel husband had inflicted on her.<br /><br />Gisele had suffered but her sprit was still strong.  She was smart and brave. She suffered greatly but I think that it made her an even more endearing heroine.<br /><br />Nigel was brave, smart and a true hero.  Although he questioned his motives for helping Gisele(I won't give his worries away) He was always honorable towards Gisele and constanly risked his life to save her.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more of the Highland series.<br /><br />Sensuality rating 3.5 out of 5.	2005-03-27

Always is the second book that I have read and like the first it is a winner.<br /><br />Always has it all an engaging couple with fantastic chemistry.<br /><br />A believilbe mystery and interesting secondary characters makes for a very entertaining read.<br /><br />Always begins with King Henry ordering a resently unengaged knight named Aric to marry his illegitimate daughter or die.  Rosamunde is a convent raised girl ready to take the veil.  Wishing to make her father happy she agrees to marry an total stranger.  The marriage is consumated in a very fuuny scene comes up a few more times through out the book.  All I will say is that Rosamunde spent alot of time around animals and had just one sexual position stuck in her head.<br /><br />There were some sad moments but more than enough comedy to make me laugh again and again.<br /><br />The love between Aric and Rosamunde is what romance novels are all about.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Sensuality rating 4.5 out of 5.	2005-03-27

It took me a few days to finsih it.  I usually read a good story in 1-2 days.<br /><br />The story wasn't poorly written but it lacked that magic that One Moonlite Night had.

Although it is set in India I believe that women of all enthic and religious backgrounds can relate in some way to Akhila.  The roles of women and the expectations of family and culture on a womans purpose in life is beautifully explored in rich and touching detail.  Akhila is 45 and has always been a dutiful eldest daughter.  Her wants and needs have alsways taken second to a family who never appreciated her sacrifices.<br /><br />Finally after years spent living by the rules and expecations of her family and culture Akhila decides to do something for herself regardless of what anyone else thinks.  This is the beginnning of a journey of self discovery and life altering changes.<br /><br />On the train Akhila meets four other women in the all women sleeping car; the Ladies Coupe. These women share thier life stories including the love and the heartaches.<br /><br />I won't go into details about each womens story because I do not want to spoil the story.  However, each womans story was just as touching as Akhilas.<br /><br />This book asks the question that women no matter where they are from have been faced with at one point in their lives.  Can a womans life be complete without a man and children?<br /><br />For Akhila's answer you have to read the book.	2005-03-13

In fact I started this book several months ago and just couldn't get past how much of a jerk Ross. I was bored this weekend and I had nothing to read and decided to give this book another try. I still could not finish it.  I made it through about 100 pages but the interaction between Ross and Tessa just didn't work for me.  Ross was overbearing and cruel and he justified his behavior because it was for her safety and he had her grandfathers approval.  Tessa was young but she had the right to know that she was in danger.  Instead Tessa was treated like a simple minded child.<br /><br />I prefer romance novels where the heroines are not teenagers and the heros are not jerks.  Arrogance in a hero of a romance novel is expected but Ross was just to much for me.  If you like romance mixed with a mystery try Amanda Quick's Mistress.	2005-03-07

When I read mysteries I never try to guess who did it.  I prefer to just enjoy the unfolding story.  However, I figured out who did it without even trying.

Ms. Alers has attempted to combine a romance with suspense and on some levels she succeeds and on others she fails.<br /><br />She seems to follow the same formula in all three books.  All three heros were tall and rich and  over the top handsome.  All three heroines were tall, exotic and beautiful. No one character stood out.  Every hero and heroine were interchangible.<br /><br />In my opinion Vows was the best of the three novels.  The chemistry between Joshua and Vanessa was believable.  The plot was also interesting.  It was connected to Hidden Agenda but was written much better.<br /><br />Hidden Agenda was poorly written.  I kept thinking was Ms. Alers must have had a very short deadline because this story is really bad. The dialogue was really really bad. I felt i was reading a very bad soap opera script. The story had potential but it was poorly written.  Matt's mission was never explained and the short scenes that involved Eves exhusband was just bizarre.  She is his exwife and the mother of his son but kept referring to her as if she were a stranger. Matt and Eve lacked chemistry and I just didn't see how they could have possibly fallen in love.<br /><br />Hideaway was also boring with a predictable ending.  Parris and Martin just were not interesting to me.<br /><br />Hideaway  1 star<br />Hidden Agenda  1 star<br />Vows  4 stars<br /><br />Vows is the only reason why I rated the book 3 stars.	2005-02-21

This is my second book after Always and Forever and it can not compare.<br /><br />I liked that Loreli was smart and independent and wealthly.  I also liked that she wasn't spinister virgin, a young virgin or someone who had never enjoyed sex until she met the hero of the book.  However, for the life of me can't see what she saw in Jake.  He was one of the most boring lack luster heros I've ever read about.<br /><br />In addition,  the story was just boring.

Unfortunately, The Taming of Jessi Rose in comparsion isn't half as good. Griffin and Jessi lacked chemistry.  There was no magic.  Jessi's problem over shadowed thier romance.  They didn't even really have time to fall in love.<br /><br />I did like that Jessi was strong and brave and didn't allow all she had suffered to break her spirit.  Which is why I gave the book 3 stars instead of two.<br />Sensuality rating 3 out of 5.	2005-02-19

I bought this book based on the good reviews.  I enjoyed thie beginning very much.  Lydia was a great herione.  She had all the qualities that I like in a heroine.  She was smart, brave and independent.  I didn't really like Vere that much.  He was so overdone that I really couldn't warm up to him at all.  I know he suffered a lot of personal tradgey but he needed to get over it already.<br /><br />In the beginning the verbal foreplay between Lydia and Vere was great.  When the finally did have sex, the scenes were disappointing.  They didn't have any of the passion that I expected and they were pretty boring.<br /><br />At about page 252 this book seemed never ending.  It dragged and dragged and Ms. Chase added in my opinion an unnecessary plot twist.  Also the constant references to to her previous books was annoying.<br />Sensuality rating 2 out of 5.	2005-02-16

I took this book with me on my fight to Mexico to pass the time.  I couldn't even get half way through the book.  It was the most boring book that I have ever read in my life.  The beginning was very promising.  However, after about the first 100 pages this book was about as interesting as watching grass grow or paint dry.  If you want to read it for yourself please save your money and check it out from the library.	2004-12-12
US	16179897	RAX22INGWP8ZY	0380786095	26917620	One Moonlit Night	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A Truly Romantic Story	This is one of my favorite romance novels to date.  This was the first Samantha James book that I have read and it will not be my last!  Olivia and Dominic were well developed as indivduals and together they had fantastic chemistry.  I dislike weak female heroines and really dislike overbearing male heros.  Olivia had a quite strenght and it showed in her ability to live a hopeful life after suffering so much sorrow.  Dominic being 1/2 gypsy and treated so cruelly by his father and society desperately wanted love even though he didn't know it until he met Olivia. Minor intrigues added to the story as well as Olivias sister Emily's romance with Andre didn't distract from the main story.<br />The love scenes between Dominic and Olivia had just the right amount of romance and sensuality.  Sizzle without being crude.<br /><br />This book is a keeper for my library.<br />Sensuality rating 4 out of 5	2004-11-25

I dislike jelly fish women and overly aggressive chip on my shoulder heros.<br />Yes it is understandable that Remmington would want revenge on the man he thinks killed his family.  However, using the mans daughter to get revenge has not only been done to death but is also not the mind set that I personnally look for in a hero.<br /><br />I also had trouble understanding why Elenor feel in love with Remmington.  What exactly did he do other than kiss her a couple of times before she fell in love with him.  There was no getting to know you momments and he spent way too much timing ploting revenge or telling her what she is or is not going to do.<br /><br />Oeverall the lack of charcter development and and lack of chemistry between Elenor and Remmington made this book seem never ending.<br />Sensuality rating 3 out of 5.	2004-11-25
US	16179897	R3TT7M8HEW58AY	0156027348	376354325	Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls	Books	4	17	19	N	N	An important read	This book brought back so many unpleasant memories of my own middle and high school years.  I could relate to so many of the girls stories about exclusion and betrayal by trusted grilfriends.  I found myself shaking my head and saying that Ms. Simmons was right on target on many points.  For anyone who has a daughter, I think that this book would be an important part of their library. I also like that Ms. Simmons spoke to girls from many ethnic and economic backgrounds and not just middle and upper class girls from the suburbs.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-24
US	16179897	R18SV90GOC2Q24	097243772X	818085619	Oath of Challenge - Conquering Kate	Books	3	12	13	N	Y	Very erotic but.....	This is only the second erotic novel that I have read.  I was an avid romance reader a few years back.  I've just started reading romance again and order this book for a spicery read.  The sex scenes were vivid and detailed without being lewed.  I am not interested in threesomes or same sex or public sex which this book didn't have.  The chemistry between Kate and Tair was hot but the overall story was just so so.  Maybe I needed to read the first book in the series because the book needed more that just good sex in my opinion.  This scene was set on another world but the reader was never given a good look at this other world.  Kate never met other people or explored her new \\"home\\" .  There were not details about the planet or Tairs work or culture other than details about merging and linking.<br /><br />I think that I will stick to traditional romance because I like a good story as well as good sex.	2004-11-23
US	16179897	R3LPR9JY7T0NDB	0553563343	755856344	Breath of Magic	Books	1	6	19	N	N	This book makes my top 10 worst romance list	I will never buy anything by this author again.  Maybe I might give her another chance if I come across her book at the library but I doubt it.  I didn't like Aran and I hated Tristan.  Aran was so boring and Tristan was a jerk.  Unlike Beyond the Highland Mist (which was excellent)  too much time was wasted on other suplots of the story.  For example Tristan's hatred of his mother.  His resentment of being abandoned and on and on and on.  There was no chemisry between the two of them at all so the sex scene was exactly what I expected.  Boring ZZZZZZ!<br />I bought this book because of all the 4&5 star ratings but...everyone has different tastes.  I just could not see how this book rated 4 or 5 stars.<br />Also to racist getto scene when Tristan \\"resues\\" Aran from Harlem<br />I could have done without.	2004-11-07
US	16179897	R3SY6SW5GOCWC2	1573227161	950636517	Caucasia: A Novel	Books	2	9	27	N	N	Run of the mill biracial theme	Other reviewers have used words like powerful and enlightening.<br />I respectfully disagree.  The character development of every chaacter was weak.  Birdies parents were so one dimensional.  Ms.  Senna seemed to think that there history was unimportant to the story.  For a white woman and a black man to marry in the 60's the was radical and possilby life threatening yet she didn't think it was important enough to really explore other than a paragraph or two.  Did her mom marry a black man to hurt her mother??  Did her father marry a white woman as part of his long term social expermiment??  Or did they really once upon a time love each other??  We never learned what Birdies mom was doing in her basement.<br />We had nothing prove that she was involved in a social and politcal relovution. Was it as serious as her mom  made it out to be or was she just being paranoid? More imporantly why did her parents breakup and separate the girls?? Was it really because the FBI was after thier mom or was thier father tired of his biracial family experiment?? These were some unanswered questions that Ms. Senna did not bother to explore.<br />Instead of really exploring to complex world of a biracial family Ms.  Senna spent way too much time on Birdie and her time passing a white.  \\"Jesses\\" involvement with Nick was so pointless and and waste of time.  Instead of Nicholas and Mona Ms. Senna should have developed a relationship between Samantha and Jesse.  Of course Samantha knew that Jesse was passing. Many people of color can tell when someone is passing.  Why Ms. Senna wasted this wonderful opportunity for these two girls talk and explore how they coped in an all white town will always remain a mystery to me.<br />There were also some sterotyping that I found very weak and annoying.  For example this obsession that Ms. Senna had with lotion.  Just becasue Samantha was raised by a white family meant that she had never heard of lotion?? Just like Birdie and Cole never used lotion until they when to school.  She made it sound like lotion was well guarded secret by the Black community. Also was they Samantha and Stuart were portrayed.  They were written as two people who tried too hard to ignore that they were black and were willing to accept slights and racist jokes to be accepted.  Maybe that was one way to cope but not the only way.  Finally the book took way too long to get ultimately nowhere. It took me three long months to finish this book and it was not worth the effort.  If you want to read a \\"powerful\\" and \\"enlightening\\"  book please read Ladies Coupe by Anita Nair.	2004-11-07
US	16179897	RSFFGZ7ZPXSTC	0964894238	565906782	The Forever Kiss	Books	3	8	10	N	Y	Good but not great	I am became a fan of Angela Knight after reading Kissing the Hunter and Roarke's Prisoner from the Secrets volumes.  I ordered this book with high hopes but was a little disappointed. I think that Valerie and \\"Cowboy\\" had great sexual chemistry but little else.  They had this connection through thier dreams but to me it wasn't enough.  Other than a hero and lover from her dreams Valerie really didn't know Cade.  When they did meet there was no time relationship development.  They were forced together by the vampire who was responsible for the death of her parents.  Ms. Knight writes hot sex scenes and the plot was good.  I just expected more character development from a longer novel.	2004-11-06

The problems began within the first pages.  Ms. Joy must be a big Star Wars fan.  The chacter names, their weapons(a light saber???),  the Yoda knock off!!! Give me a break!!! If that wasn't bad enough Deana was an unbelievible chacter.  First is her reaction to finding a strange man in her livng room.  She doesn't freak out too much and when she finds out that he is from another plant what does she do??  She takes him on vacation with her because according to Lorgin he can't leave her side. Totally unbelievible!!! Lorgin is a jerk and I didn't like him one bit.  He was quick to anger and constantly used sex to control Deana.  If she step out of line and questioned him he became angry and had sex with her.  I dislike weak female chacters who can be controlled by sex. On the rare occassions that Deena did act like she had a brain. All Lorgin had to do was strip her and have sex and that has the end of that. This was my first Dara Joy book and unless I can read another free at the library it will be my last.<br /><br />Also this magical quest that Lorgin was on was never really explained and the ending was very anticlimatic.	2004-11-06
