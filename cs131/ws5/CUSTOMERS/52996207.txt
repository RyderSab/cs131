He is also progenitor of ordinary language philosophy and ordinary common sense. The sensible world is restored as a first principle; something that cannot be proven, but all must concede exists. And all perception is veridical. The Inquiry captures all the nuances of the five senses as we ordinarily have come to know them. Ditto, reason, which is the focus of the first Essay. Yes, reason can lead one into infinite regress, especially when it comes to causes and effects, but we necessarily rely on some element of reason (conception, imagination, judgment) to give us bearings in the world. The final Essay is on morality. It is the least interesting, if only because Reid appeals to the \\"Author of our being\\" to establish first principles of right and wrong. Even so, humans are endowed naturally with a moral sense so that many of the appeals to God could just as easily be appeals to our endowment by human nature. But the number of his first principles is inordinate.<br /><br />One of the problems with Reid's entire approach is the number of his first principles. I stopped counting after forty. Somehow that many first principles defeats the whole notion of first principle. Even if I agree with Reid that Descartes' starting point, the thinking self, is the wrong first principle, at least Descartes starts with one first principle and deduces others. Likewise, Berkeley and Hume, one to an idealist conclusion, one to a sceptical conclusion. Reid's approach is manifestly opposite. Since he insists so much of what we are consists of numerous first principles, soon the whole notion of \\"first principle\\" loses its meaning. In a sense, to save the rest of ordinary language and common sense philosophy, he must abuse the ordinary notion of \\"first principle.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, there needs to be a better balance. Surely, that man is sentient can itself be a first principle, and that man is a rational animal can be another, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.other, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.	2005-10-12

It's highly accessible and covers a lot of territory, more than any other introduction I've encountered. It's only drawback is its superficiality, as it doesn't fully cover probability, mathematical calculus, boolean logic, decision trees, or theorems and proofs..<br /><br />The book begins with the uses of language, fallacies, arguments in ordinary language, Venn Diagrams, and then proceeds to symbolic logic, Aristotlean and a cursory overview of predicate calculus, quantification, science and hypothesis, analogy and probability (especially Mill's four rules of causal inference), and concludes with logic and the law (as a practical example of the application of logic).<br /><br />This book would make an excellent text for an introduction to philosophical logic and arguments. There are definitely superior books that deal with each of the above subjects individually, but none that I know that covers such broad terrain in a short amount of space. As more and more colleges and universities mandate some course in critical thinking, I cannot think of a better text for an introductory overview. If this is the text, take the course.

I don't accept Descartes' starting point, so I find the entailments confused and incoherent. But if one does accept Descartes' starting point, then the two extremes must be heeded. If for no other reason than observing the absurdity of either man's conclusions, it is valuable to read both entailments. But in their confused process, both men bring certain salient features to light.<br /><br />Hume accepts Descartes starting point, making it his own. But to Descartes method, he adds Pyrrhonist scepticism: That all reason leads to infinite regress, and that all sensations (or impressions) can not be trusted.<br /><br />Hume begins with the conclusion that all sense perception is either an impression or idea. Even memory and imagination, two other faculties of the mind, are conflated into these two species of perceptions, as impressions. Their difference is one of degree (vivacity), not of kind. Hence, Hume is the author of what is known as the \\"Copy Principle.\\" Instead of unmediated, direct perception through the ordinary senses, all perception is mediated by the imagination into impressions and ideas. From this follows certain resemblances, contiguity, and causal associations between impressions or ideas, and from this association we develop a sense of self. But even the notion of causality here is one of implied inference, not of actual inductive reason. Hume denies there is any real causality that can be known, although we operate \\"as if\\" we infer cause from effect. Even probability is reduced to a mere association of ideas and/or impressions; because neither reason (which always leads to infinite regress) or senses (which can always be deceived) can actually be true. The Enquiry also treats of miracles and the testimony of others derisively; but don't we rely on the testimony of others who claim the earth is round rather than flat, just as we rely on others who testify to miracles in a byegone era? After all, few of us have direct experience with a spherical earth (Popper makes this observation).<br /><br />Hume's method incorporates five kinds of scepticism: (i) methodological, (ii) conceptual, (ii) nomological, (iv) explanatory, and (v) reductive empiricism. His commitment to scepticism is not without some capitulation. While he denies absolute causality and inductive inference and probability in an actual senses, he relies on them for practical purposes. One can't remain a pyrrhonist for long; some elements of reason and some degree of confidence in impressions is necessary for ordinary life. But if one starts with Descartes' starting point, extreme scepticism is a necessary entailment. Which, after seeing Hume deny so much intuition, is it really worth starting with Descartes' scepticism? Answering that question is what makes Hume interesting.testimony of others derisively; but don't we rely on the testimony of others who claim the earth is round rather than flat, just as we rely on others who testify to miracles in a byegone era?

The dangerous idea is natural selection by adaptation, a random force of nature in selecting the fittest to survive. The book is ubiquitously cited in almost all books written after it, because of its thoroughness, elegance, sophistication, and accessibility.<br /><br />It would be impossible to summarize this enormous, urbane, and encyclopedic book. Briefly, Part One rehearses some of Darwin's key elements, and gives biological as well as non-biological justifications for these key Darwinian concepts. Stunningly, these covert \\"other\\" reasons are absolutely superfluous; Darwinism does not need them, but Dennett provides them \\"as if\\" they actually mattered. Highly persuasive. Part Two develops Darwin's thoughts against the intransigent, most notably religionists and other so-called evolutionists who won't take Darwinism the entire way. Darwin has proven himself smarter than some of his devotees, and Dennett shows us how and why. Part Three examines Darwinian thinking outside the realm of biology, such as Darwinian consciousness, linguistics, mimesis, etc. The last Part was the least interesting, only because E. O. Wilson's \\"Consilience\\" has subsequently given a clearer and more rational case than does Dennett.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written, and some parts are extremely philosophical, rather than biological, in nature. Dennett relies on numerous thought experiments, which are a tool of philosophy that may alienate some readers. Still, these thought experiments provide additional support for Darwinian thinking, not just in biology, but as E. O. Wilson argues in his \\"Consilience,\\" in all human endeavors.<br /><br />This is NOT the book to begin an enquiry into evolution or Darwinian thinking, rather it should be near the end. Just when you think (i) Darwinism doesn't quite succeed, or (ii) Darwin is entirely too successful, Dennett brings out implications that convict the convinced and convert the marginal. A challenging and provocative read. Recommended to all, but especially philosophers and biologists.ly too successful, Dennett brings out implications that convict the convinced and convert the marginal.

The fact that humans have a past, present, and future consciousness makes them alert to many other possibilities of the imagination. Enter Rollo May and his existential psychology, which is a blend of existentialist philosophy, psychology, and literature. Together, they make us aware of what it is to be truly human.<br /><br />This is not a self-help book, although no reader will go away disappointed. This is a book about integration of our deepest needs, coupled with our unique human biology, that makes us unique among all of earth's habitants. It is a focused look at what we must do to live life optimally by stripping away many of our attachments. These attachments often become security blankets that in turn become a source of alienation from fundamental choices we all must make. Once discarded, and opting for freedom and responsibility, we can live our own autonomous lives.<br /><br />There are few prescriptions per se. Rather, this is an examination of a life lived well. In May's paradigm, the challenge is to force our inner being to a higher awareness of self-consciousness. He shows us how. I read this book 20 years ago, and reread it recently. It is still fresh and invigorating. It's easy to read, and really quite insightful. If you're unacquainted with May, this is a good place to begin. A delight to read	2005-10-07

America. His mellifluous writing and lucid exposition have earned him the wide respect that he deserves.<br /><br />\\"The Beautiful Room is Empty\\" is a sequel to his earlier \\"A Boy's Own Story,\\" the evolving process of coming-out gay in the Sixties. The first novel scouts the adolescent years; this novel covers early adulthood. Much has changed in the way that people come-out today, versus the time when being gay was stigmatized by everybody. Curing homosexuality was seen as viable by both the queer himself and by the anti-queer establishment. Fortunately, while coming-out may still be a demanding process, it is far less traumatic than a few score ago, because of these earlier pioneers.<br /><br />In an almost plotless chronicle of coming-out, the focus is on the author's first-person's introspection of dealing with himself and the gay world as it was then. The ways in which people connected were far more convoluted, clandestine, and often illegal. It wasn't much of a life, until the Stonewall riots liberated gays from their false imprisonment. It not only opened new avenues by which to meet and socialize, but it also rejected the premise that gays should be neither heard nor seen. The toll these older restrictions had on men and women must have been truly appalling, causing much externalized homophobia to turn inward.<br /><br />To see how far the GLBT community has come in the past 40 years is itself a witness to these earlier pioneers. We owe it to them to hear their story, especially when it's this well-told.	2005-09-30

At the turn of the 20th C. William James took Hume's empiricism and applied it to psychology, and devised the first scientific theory of empirical psychology that included emotions (cf., Freud and Jung, for example, and \\"depth\\" psychology). Since then, neuroscience has retreated from these catholic notions into the strictly computational (cognitive) aspects of brain function. Ledoux lays out a plan to rehabilitate cognitive science by restoring the older idiom that includes emotions.<br /><br />This is an extremely elementary and superficial book; therefore it might serve as a good introduction to brain science in general. Sadly, it spends way too much time rehearsing psychology's failures before alighting onto the rehabilitation. Over 30% of the works cited in the first hundred pages are over 50 years old (as is much of the bibliography). Of course, emotions weren't part of the curriculum back then, so this rehearsal of  history only serves to show just how neglected one of psychology's most salient features has been. I suspect it has merit for the naive reader, but it was extremely boring and tedious to anyone with much sense of what's been going on in the past 10-15 years. Fortunately, Ledoux offers the reader a glimpse of what's to follow on pp. 16-20. If this material is old hat, bypass this book. If this material is new, this book may be of interest to you.<br /><br />But, before buying this book, peruse Daniel Goldman's \\"Emotional Intelligence.\\" Despite being over ten years old, and despite the error of locating all emotions in the amygdala, it's otherwise a much more endearing and provocative work than Ledoux's (issued about the same time). Another interesting and provocative book is Victor Johnston's \\"Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions.\\" At least Johnston's theory of consciousness is novel, and his handling of emotions is much more on target. If you want a philosophical perspective, I heartily recommend Martha Nussbaum's \\"Upheavals of Thought\\" and/or \\"Therapy of Desire\\" or Ronald DeSouza's \\"Rationality of Emotions.\\" All of these illuminating works explore emotions from a historical perspective, dating back to the Golden Age of Greece. In light of these other fine books, Ledoux's cannot be recommended.on's \\"Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions.\\" At least Johnston's theory of consciousness is novel, and his handling of emotions is much more on target.

This grouping of essays, some previously published, here first published together, is an eyeful and earful to behold. If you don't already know, Dawkins is a committed Darwinist, but not a social Darwinist. Most of these essays help prove these two features are not contradictions. I find Dawkins at his best in these limited formats; they stir the spirit and excite the mind, without any pretense at an overarching scheme, except Darwinism.

It starts off on an inspirational note, but then devolves into variegated ruminations. Much of the territory covered in the first-two chapters presupposes much antecedent information that naive readers may find baffling or confusing. He also takes a dismissive, rather than explanatory, attitude toward vitalism in the third chapter. I agree that vitalism is no longer viable, but this needs demonstration, not just derision. His chapter on Design answers the critics, except for one critical point: How did the difference sexes evolve, which to me is the truest difficulty, not the evolution of the eyes (see Matt Ridley's \\"Red Queen\\" for the answer). The fourth chapter, concerning nature's utility, is the least interesting. Dawkins spends way too much time on population genetics rather than answer directly the question that Aristotle posed: What is it for? Since Aristotle, natural philosophy has been concerned with material, formal, efficient, and final causes, although all but efficient causality has fallen by the wayside in modernity, except for Creationists. For them, a residue of final causality still exists, What is something for, or what is its function? This is an intelligible question when asked of human production and artefacts, but quite useless when asked of nature, unless one gives Dawkins' pithy response: DNA replication. But it doesn't take a whole chapter to answer the question that forthrightly. This is Dawkins' most patronizing and unflattering work; he's always tendentious, but capable of much better.	2005-09-27

This is a most articulate and descriptive analysis of Hume's thought in context of those who preceded him and detractors who have followed. Garrett is a first-rate apologist, not of the philosopher, but of the cognitive psychologist, David Hume. From the outset, Garrett regards Hume's significant contributions to cognitive psychology as first rate and unparalleled in history. What Garrett shows on this interpretation is that Hume uses the philosophical method to explicate his cognitive psychology.<br /><br />Garrett first contextualizes Hume in the empirical school of philosophy vis-a-vis the rationalists; experience sola is normative, everything else speculation. But Hume's philosophy is less pronounced than his psychology, which dominates all his thought. Hume intends not to speculate, but observe, and make generalizations about his observations in regards to human understanding, passions, and sentiments - i.e., human nature. Seen in this light, many of the irreconcilable problems philosophers have raised concerning Hume seem to dissipate, and a new appreciation for his cognitive insights become more pronounced.<br /><br />Garrett's heuristic approach is very Thomistic in tenor and form. Similar to Aquinas, he posits Hume's theories in a brief synopsis, outlines the controversies it has provoked, provides a logical framework to provide answers, and then answers the critics. The first chapter, in addition to a historical context, also established the essential frameworks that Hume works within: (1) Imagination vs. Intellect; (2) the Copy Principle; (3) Evidentiary Inferences; (4) the Five Kinds of Empiricism; (5) the Separability Principle; (6) the Philosophical Method of Cognitive Psychology; and (7) Reason vs. Induction. The remainder of the book examines Hume's central tenets in light of the foregoing: (i) The definitions of `cause;' (ii) liberty and necessity; (iii) on miracles; (iv) personal identity; (v) moral evaluation; and (vi) skepticism and commitment.<br /><br />Unlike Norman Kemp Smith's excellent, but slightly outdated, \\"Philosophy of David Hume,\\" written near the middle of the 20th C., Garrett tackles both religion and moral commitment after his exegesis of Hume's epistemology - in the same order as found in Hume's \\"Treatise on Human Nature.\\" Also unlike Smith, Garrett goes beyond the THN to examine all of Hume's work, where he finds considerable consistency of mind and approach. Also unlike Smith, Garrett is far more deferential to Hume; this book is definitely a defense against the critics. That's not to say Garrett is unabashed in his favoritism; he acknowledges some of Hume's shortcomings. But where possible, Garrett, using the paradigm of cognitive psychology, defends Hume in an intelligent, concise, and elegant manner. I recommend both, starting first with Smith; but if access is limited to only one, let it be Garrett's.miracles; (iv) personal identity; (v) moral evaluation; and (vi) skepticism and commitment. <br /> <br />Unlike Norman Kemp Smith's excellent, but slightly outdated, \\"Philosophy of David Hume,\\" written near the middle of the 20th C., Garrett tackles both religion and moral commitment after his exegesis of Hume's epistemology - in the same order as found in Hume's \\"Treatise on Human Nature.\\" Also unlike Smith, Garrett goes beyond the THN to examine all of Hume's work, where he finds considerable consistency of mind and approach.

The book introduces \\"evolutionary medicine\\" to help the reader make informed choices about his or her own health. No one who wants to live a long, healthy life can afford to ignore the important insights gleaned from evolution in this book. What worked when we were hunter-gatherers on the African savannas no longer works in modern society, and the changes in our modern environments have caused Homo sapiens to adapt poorly.<br /><br />One of the key evolutionary concepts is an entity's adaptation to its environment: When all the body's organs and systems are operating optimally under the ideal evolutionary environments, both internally and externally, our bodies are concordant. When our bodies are out of sync with either environment, they begin to fail, and our bodies become discordant. The former is homeostasis and health, the latter is disease and dysfunction.<br /><br />After a very short introduction to the essential Darwinian concepts, excellently and easily recapitulated, the author turns to the seventeen stages of human evolutionary development, beginning with prokaryotes as stage one and ending with Homo sapiens as stage seventeen millions of years later, and describing all the intermediary stages in between. Although not difficult, it's the only place where the reader might become pensive, if not impatient, thinking the author is off course. But the key to understanding the rest of the book depends on understanding the material presented in Chapter Two. Here are some of the insights in columnar outline:<br /><br />LEVEL OF EVOLUTION, ADAPTIVE FAILURE,  CONSEQUENCE<br /><br />Pre-life, Environmental poisons, Birth defects<br /><br />Single cell, Viral infection, Cold/Flu/HIV<br /><br />Morula (sponge-like), Cellular stress, Cancer<br /><br />Chordate, Physical stress, Back pain<br /><br />Fish, Excess dietary salt, Heart disease<br /><br />Amphibian, Tobacco smoke, Lung disease<br /><br />Lower primate, Excess dietary sugar, Diabetes mellitus<br /><br />Higher primate, Vitamin C deficiency, Scurvy<br /><br />Ape, Excess dietary protein, Gout<br /><br />Homo sapiens, Reduced dietary variety, Allergies<br /><br />This is a partial list. Each of the seventeen stages co-exist in humans; this complexity is both to our advantage, and can be our downfall. Understanding how each stage of evolution works within us unlocks a wealth of information.<br /><br />Obviously, the emphasis is on prevention, not treatment, although there are constructive, non-medical, non-surgical options discussed. Some of the ideas are extremely valuable and helpful, others are highly speculative and dubious. For example, one particularly difficult concept advocated by Boaz is a return to a Paleo Diet that is high in animal products (especially gamey meats), while avoiding indigestible beans, grains, and dairy. It might be the \\"ideal\\" diet, but it's an impossible one to follow, and even more difficult to find. Still, the insights can help guide one to nutrition from an evolutionary perspective. The chapter on our musculoskeletal system was by far my favorite; I suffer from many of the system's dysfunctions, and now realize why. I knew it was a failure to adapt, but exactly how was new to me.<br /><br />Nearly every anatomical and physiological system is evaluated in evolutionary terms. I'd run out of space just outlining them. Suffice it to say, this is not the only book on evolutionary medicine. This new field is literally exploding. Certainly an excellent alternative is Randolph Nesse's and George Williams' \\"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine.\\" Both are equally competent and informative, the only difference is a matter of style and approach. Take a look at both books and find the one that suits your temperament best. I truly enjoyed both. Ignoreeither to your health's detriment.ment.	2005-09-18

Prior to modern science, the only book of science that stands out from the others is \\"On the Nature of Things,\\" a synthesis of empirical theory and Epicurean thought that anticipates scientific materialism by more than 18 centuries. Lucretius is the first author to introduce the notion of \\"atom\\" into the lexicon; it laid dormant for centuries. He's the first person to anticipate nature as an empirical, rather than metaphysical, construct. Again, his ideas laid dormant for centuries. He's also, after Diogenes Laeterus, the major proponent of the Epicurean philosophy, which is enjoying a minor renaissance after being mislabeled hedonistic. For Lucretius, there either is matter or void; no intermediaries exist. Likewise, there either is life or death, no preexistence or afterlife. Again, it took centuries for his novel scientific constructions to take hold once again. The Church did its best to suppress Lucretius, and it wasn't until the Renaissance that he again attained wide readership.<br /><br />This translation from the Latin is unparalleled.<br /><br />Anyone and everyone interested in the history of science, Western intellectual history, and the non-hedonistic Epicurean way of life will find the rich material here both interesting and enriching. Lucretius is the only major thinker of antiquity to have a profound influence in the modern age, and his rediscovery after centuries of neglect is enlightening. Enjoy.	2005-09-17

But if one wants an English translation opposite the Latin original, it's certainly the reference work that many scholars prefer.<br /><br />For the rest of us, the English Dominican Fathers' translation of the early 20thC. is very, very good indeed. It's single virtue is that the same translation of words is used consistently throughout, even if the particular choice of words might not strike 21stC. readers in quite the same way. Some of the language is beginning to show its wear and tear, but once one is in the mindset, the reading is exceptionally clear.<br /><br />For those new to Aquinas, his methodology may strike some readers as odd. It's really a simple, yet elegant, system. First, Aquinas poses a question to be answered. Then he gives a variety of answers from others in the past. When you see, \\"but I reply,\\" then you know you're getting to nugget of Aquinas' gems. After his reply, he responds to each of the previous author's opinions, stating why or how they are in any way deficient.<br /><br />Several features become instantly obvious. Aquinas had an encyclopedic mind and a good knowledge of Patristic and Aristotlean thought. Whenever possible, his answers are an a priori synthesis of the best Patristics and the best of Aristotle. These five, dense volumes in this edition illustrate the majestic scope of his enterprise. (His Summa Contra Gentiles is very similar.) There isn't really a subject or vantage that Aquinas doesn't cover. All his Summas are really magisterial (in the non-ecclesiastical sense). Lastly, Aquinas' command of the syllogism is unparalleled in human history. This is at once both its strength and its weakness. Strength in the sense of deductive logic, weakness in the sense of inductive logic. I'm convinced one can use the syllogism to argue just about anything, and if Aquinas is an example, he's an example of this mastery.<br /><br />The critical question every reader must answer for himself is whether such an enterprise amounts to very much. Yes, Aquinas literally speaks volumes, but about what? Angels dancing on the head of a pin? I don't mean to detract from his keen arguments for the existence of God, his hermeutical theory (I, 1, 10), or his natural law theory. But at some point one has to ask is all this really relevant to our lives? Much of it still speaks to us today, but much of it is nothing more than armchair speculation.<br /><br />If one starts with the wrong theory of nature (Aristotle's), weeds out the weakest of the Patristics, confines one's self to the syllogism, and sets out to explain everything under the sun (that's not the center of the solar system), then the modern reader is going to find Aquinas, despite his bravura, is often impotent. Even his (not Suarez's) natural law theory is highly tendentious by confusing \\"is\\" for \\"ought\\" (the naturalistic fallacy). And if one follows Aquinas' logic, then the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is wrong on all points.<br /><br />So what's the value of Aquinas for today's reader? I can no longer answer that important question. I can point to Aquinas' encyclopedic mind, his illustrative use of the syllogism, and cite his potency for nearly six centuries.

Both these books will be of immense help.r />The critical question every reader must answer for himself is whether such an enterprise amounts to very much. Yes, Aquinas literally speaks volumes, but about what? Angels dancing on the head of a pin? I don't mean to detract from his keen arguments for the existence of God, his hermeutical theory (I, 1, 10), or his natural law theory. But at some point one has to ask is all this really relevant to our lives? Much of it still speaks to us today, but much of it is nothing more than armchair speculation. <br /> <br />If one starts with the wrong theory of nature (Aristotle's), weeds out the weakest of the Patristics, confines one's self to the syllogism, and sets out to explain everything under the sun (that's not the center of the solar system), then the modern reader is going to find Aquinas, despite his bravura, is often impotent. Even his (not Suarez's) natural law theory is highly tendentious by confusing \\"is\\" for \\"ought\\" (the naturalistic fallacy). And if one follows Aquinas' logic, then the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is wrong on all points. <br /> <br />So what's the value of Aquinas for today's reader? I can no longer answer that important question. I can point to Aquinas' encyclopedic mind, his illustrative use of the syllogism, and cite his potency for nearly six centuries. In the end, though, he no longer seems relevant, and in spite of his magisterial accomplishment, one needs to ask: To what end? So before buying the whole set, pick up an Aquinas \\"reader\\" to see if he still speaks to you. If he does, then splurge on this wonderful set. <br /> <br />Lastly, every master benefits from secondary sources, and an excellent companion to Aquinas' Summa in Paul Glenn's \\"Tour of the Summa.\\" It simply distills Aquinas' nuggets.

He's the first modern empirical psychologist who anticipates William James by a century. He's also the first modern philosopher to extol experience alone as paramount to understanding human behavior as the first in the long line of Pragmatic philosophers. He's also the first modern philosopher to employ exclusively the scientific method of Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton as paradigmatic. He's the second (after Francis Hutcheson) to instantiate a naturalist and intuitionist ethic known as benevolent or sentimentalist theory. And besides which, he's one of the few major philosophers who is accessible to the general public.<br /><br />But as accessible as Hume is, it's always helpful to have a reliable commentary to bring out the subtle nuances of a particular philosopher. Thus was A. E. Taylor to Plato, J. H. Randall to Aristotle, Brian Davies to Thomas Aquinas, and Norman Kemp Smith to David Hume. Written in the first-third of the 20thC., this artful and insightful commentary on Hume's basic writings, especially of Hume's \\"Treatise on Human Nature,\\" is indispensable. Long out of print, Macmillan has corrected the deficit and reissued this important study that covers the antecedents, writings, and subsequent influence of David Hume.<br /><br />Kemp's thesis is that one cannot understand Hume's project without first understanding Hume's moral epistemology and the ascendent influence of Hutcheson in forming it. Ironically, Hume's moral epistemology isn't made manifest until Part III of his youthful \\"Treatise,\\" after dealing first with cognition and second the passions. Hume's method is entirely pragmatic in that experience alone, as opposed to a priori speculation, or even induction, is the sole means of understanding human cognition, belief, passions, and morals. Kemp also illustrates Hume's extreme method to avoid both dogmatism and skepticism, the two horns of the philosophers' dilemma that produce a quixotic approach that is uniquely Hume's. Consequently, Kemp's interpretation of Hume comes across as less an empricist and more rigorously a populizer of the \\"vulgar\\" in a non-philosophical sense. The only substantive subject Kemp omits is Hume's criticism of religion as superstition, but this omission is somewhat obvious and trivial in light of its natural consequence of Hume's overall experientialist, non-ratiocinative project.<br /><br />Kemp's style, clarity, and incisiveness match his subject's. He spent thirty years pondering David Hume's thought and writings, and it wasn't until his insight about Hume's moral epistemology that everything came together for him as a coherent whole. And as tendentious as Kemp's thesis is, it's fully documented and carefully executed, so that even the skeptic must concede Kemp's invaluable contribution. Still, the omission concerning the \\"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\\" is lamentable, if only because it is of particular importance to Hume's experientialist project. An excellent alternative and complementary commentary, \\"Cognition and Commitment: Hume's Philosophy,\\" by Dan Garrett is a more current, and a very different, approach. Both are very highly recommended.uently, Kemp's interpretation of Hume comes across as less an empricist and more rigorously a populizer of the \\"vulgar\\" in a non-philosophical sense.

At the turn of the 20th C. William James took Hume's empiricism and applied it to psychology, and devised the first scientific theory of empirical psychology that included emotions (cf., Freud and Jung, for example, and \\"depth\\" psychology). Since then, neuroscience has retreated from these catholic notions into the strictly computational (cognitive) aspects of brain function. LeDoux lays out a plan to rehabilitate cognitive science by restoring the older idiom that includes emotions.<br /><br />This is an extremely elementary and superficial book; therefore it might serve as a good introduction to brain science in general. Sadly, it spends way too much time rehearsing psychology's failures before alighting onto the rehabilitation. Over 30% of the works cited in the first hundred pages are over 50 years old (as is much of the bibliography). Of course, emotions weren't part of the curriculum back then, so this rehearsal of  history only serves to show just how neglected one of psychology's most salient features has been. I suspect it has merit for the naive reader, but it was extremely boring and tedious to anyone with much sense of what's been going on in the past 10-15 years. Fortunately, LeDoux offers the reader a glimpse of what's to follow on pp. 16-20. If this material is old hat, bypass this book. If this material is new, this book may be of interest to you.<br /><br />But, before buying this book, peruse Daniel Goldman's \\"Emotional Intelligence.\\" Despite being over ten years old, and despite the error of locating all emotions in the amydala, it's otherwise a much more endearing and provocative work than LeDoux's (issued about the same time). Another interesting and provocative book is Victor Johnston's \\"Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions.\\" At least Johnston's theory of consciousness is novel, and his handling of emotions is much more on target. If you want a philosophical perspective, I heartily recommend Martha Nussbaum's \\"Upheavals of Thought\\" and/or \\"Therapy of Desire.\\" Both these illuminating works explore emotions from a historical perspective, dating back to the Golden Age of Greece. In light of these other fine books, LeDoux's cannot be recommended.n's \\"Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions.\\" At least Johnston's theory of consciousness is novel, and his handling of emotions is much more on target.

Indeed, it one of its singular strengths, but this excellent overview may not be for beginners.<br /><br />We are in the midst of the second-most important paradigm shift in history (heliocentrism being the first), and most of us only have an inkling of it. It began in 1959 with Darwin's \\"Origin of the Species\\" followed by \\"Descent of Man.\\" Because (1) its theories - plural - undermined some of our most precious traditions, (2) time was required to harness incontrovertible proof, and (3) biblical fundamentalism has assaulted it from every angle, the paradigm shift itself has been a gradual process (itself an evolutionary fact). But now that genetics, embryology, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, etc. have repeatedly demonstrated the fact of evolution, opposition and resistance is worse than useless and futile, it's counter-productive.<br /><br />But, what is evolution (aka, Darwinism, Modern Synthesis)? Most us know it is about gradual development of the immense diversity of \\"life,\\" speciation, survival of the fittest, natural selection, adaptedness, struggle for existence, and similar themes. All of which is true, but all of which is far from all that is true. Evolution requires rethinking and new language, not just adding new ideas to our knowledge base, but in many cases replacing archaic language and ideas. \\"Essences\\" must be replaced by \\"populations,\\" the Great Chain of Being is incoherent as well as untrue, ditto the scala naturae, teleology and orthogenesis, \\"higher\\" versus \\"lower\\" animals, \\"complexity\\" as superior to \\"simplicity,\\" differences in kind (mostly in degree), etc. plus an entirely different language to describe the biosphere, e.g., genotype, phenotype, demes, niches, allopatric, sympatric, genetic \\"flow\\" versus \\"drift,\\" etc. Both language and the thoughts it represents have shifted.<br /><br />Many writers of popular science, most notably Matt Ridley, have done a great job in making evolution and its implications accessible to a wide audience. Because of these achievements, Mayr's book becomes all the more necessary and indispensable: We need a scientist's textbook for laity that provides acquaintance with the language science itself uses (with a necessary glossary provided) to explain biological phenomena and their relation to evolution in one of the most significant paradigm shifts in human history. Moreover, evolution's implications need to be stressed without ambiguity and without an ulterior agenda. Finally, because so many sub-disciplines of biology were needed in the 80 years after Darwin to cohere the architecture from biology, embryology, genetics, molecular biology, paleontology, etc. few books encompass them all. Mayr's does, pointing out past errors and identifying unresolved issues and tenative hypotheses (these are on the margins, not of the fact itself).<br /><br />This basic knowledge is not only necessary to understand evolution, but is needed to evaluate sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, Darwinian psychiatry, Darwinian literary theory, the revised concept of a \\"human nature,\\" why the practice of medicine is shifting to a Darwinian orientation, why so much Western intellectual speculation, tradition, and metaphysics is now detritus, etc. It's senseless and wasteful to argue with anti-evolutionists, just as it is senseless and useless to argue with the Flat-Earth Society. The anti-evolutionists' cavils merely distract in order to divert the dialogue, while Darwinian evolution goes beyond the obvious fact of evolution; and with its insights uproots, refocuses, and reorients us in many other significant ways, so that the seemingly-intractable problems of racism, sexism, homophobia, environmental hazards, utopian schemes, useless and wasteful \\"health\\" schemes, etc. can be approached honesty and candidly from fact, not from myth or Armageddon.<br /><br />The strengths are its unrelenting scientific language, cohering the sub-disciplines and outside disciplines into one interdisciplinary, but primarily biological, explanation of evolution with exacting specificity. (The Glossary is both necessary and helpful.) It delineates the known from the consensus to the tentative. It suggests only a few of the wider implications, and creative and imaginative readers will add others. But just as important, the facts of evolution do not merely \\"add\\" to our knowledge, they change some our cherished conceptual inheritances, and require we rethink in a different mode. The spectacular ability to do all this in a single volume makes it indispensible as the paradigm shift continues.<br /><br />Highly recommended.es into one interdisciplinary, but primarily biological, explanation of evolution with exacting specificity.

I've read more than half-a-dozen of his well-written, incisive, and provocative books with great pleasure, and go out of my was to capture his frequent appraisals of culture today. I expected no less from this massive tome. After all, this is supposed to be a cultural and intellectual history of the past five-hundred years of Western civilization. But it's a major disappointment. I dove in and read half the book in less than a week. It's taken me two more years to finish it. It didn't take long for the figures, dates, features, ideas, and places to run together into a collage of abstract impressions.<br /><br />No one person merits more than three pages, and often many characters are disposed in a matter of paragraphs. The people Barzun finds significant don't seem to dovetail into my cast of illustrative characters. Shakespeare is dispensed with stunning aloofness. The most famous philosopher of this period, David Hume, garners all of three paragraphs. The only insight I recall is the impact that the railroad has drastically changing Homo sapiens' entire relationship to its environment (with other massively mobile artefacts along the way). We are no longer masters in such a mechanized world.<br /><br />I think this project was doomed by its nature. It mirrors an oversized catalogue more than a story about life. Some characters on the stage of human history have had significantly more influence than others, and comparatively few of them have been French, contrary to Barzun's Francophilia. Certainly Descartes and Napoleon, maybe Berlioz and Comte, but Fourier and Fontenelle? These \\"secondary\\" characters may merit passing mention, but trying to give them equal footing with the masters seems to under appreciate the real movers-and-shakers of history. The British are by far under-represented. Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest minds of all time, is scattered haphazardly in passing; there isn't even a focused pericope.<br /><br />Still, I confess my admiration for Barzun's encyclopedic mind. I just wish he had been more focused on some of the major figures of our not-so-distant past, and less preoccupied with lesser figures. Not Barzun's best work.I confess my admiration for Barzun's encyclopedic mind.

White has mastered the English language in an artful, florid, and elegant manner exceeding the great Nabokov himself. This novel, my first, but by no means last, to read, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story about an upper-crust, well-educated, youth in the years of his gay discovery. Common to many a gay youth, a distant, unapproving father, a surrogate, unengaged step-mother, and a self-absorbed, fickle mother are found emotionally wanting. Coming of age with hormones raging, sexual exploration searches for an outlet of its expression. Attracted to his own gender, he finds satisfaction, but remains conflicted. White soughs the seeds and watches the growth of almost every gay man's deepest yearnings. It's a soft, yet vibrant tale. Poetic, yet visceral. Masterful writing. Highly recommended.	2005-09-11

The syntax is frequently poor. E.g., \\"It was Clairaut who also correctly predicted the return of Haley's comet in 1759.\\" What happened in 1759? Clairaut's prediction or the return of Haley's comet? Words are frequently introduced early and explained later. Maybe most people in Great Britain know what a \\"parallax\\" is, but it is used five times before it's defined. Fortunately, an adequate, but by no means expansive, glossary is available. Many sentential structures are opaque, like \\"if the situation could exist, the work done on a particle in a closed curve would not be zero.\\" Antecedently, curves aren't even mentioned, nor are particles. Whence this expression about conservation of energy? This text causes a lot of similar kinds of confusion; many passages had to be reread several times to get its sense. (It can be done, but it's extremely time-consuming and highly annoying.) Mathematical formulas are introduced pages before their explanations (if one is even given). Reading science can be fun, but this book was absolutely no fun at all. I've read scores of science books, but none was as convoluted and contorted as this one. Even when one perseveres, one is disappointed by the thesis. Pass.	2005-09-07

It encourages middle-aged gay men to reassess their lives, overcome \\"the youth fetish, body fascism, and ageism of the gay male world,\\" and to live whole and fruitful lives. While many of the ideas and suggestions are platitudinous pop-psychology, like the ubiquitous solutions of \\"change of attitude,\\" the author manages to pose many insightful questions that operate even outside his own paradigm of a rebel, anarchist, and activist. Those who fit this paradigm may find even more to gravitate to than I did. Similarly, I'm not sure how most readers will respond to the author's repeated claims of both internalized and externalized homophobic victimization; obviously, queer-bashing continues unabated by the religious right and the likes of Matthew Shepard's murderers, and maybe many of us still retain too many self-censors, some of which are healthy, others not so. If so, Kooden has many ideas to help overcome them. It's a contentious, but central, point, that middle-aged gay men are still fighting to overcome more and more \\"closets,\\" especially in the fight against ageism.<br /><br />I agree generally that there is something distinctive and unique about \\"gay\\" sensibilities, and we should foster the fulfillment of these distinctive sensibilities. I'd only add \\"within the bounds of public decency\\" and \\"as an individual, not some prototype, determines.\\" He also has the reader do a lot of mental fantasizing and questioning of assumptions, through a kind of internal Socratic dialogue, which I think is a useful re-engineering and self-examination technique. As Socrates demonstrated, life improves with question-asking, not by question-begging. Those who have read my praise for Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" will find many similar techniques employed here.<br /><br />The book's eight chapters focus on body-image, hedonism, play/work, relationships, \\"true self-esteem,\\" creating one's own value system, spirituality, and letting go -- each through the prism of having \\"come out.\\" Each is stimulating in its own right, and all have something positive to contribute to one's overall self-image as he enters middle age. I found the chapter on spirituality by far the least interesting, only because, for me, at least, there's no \\"there.\\" But even an atheist can appreciate his comments.<br /><br />Despite being a pleasure to read, I have three main criticisms: (1) The author suggests a new fantasized model of the ideal gay-male at mid-life instead of the old (no pun intended), asexual, unattractive, lonely, out-of-shape, gay stereotype. I confess, if one must resort to stereotypes, his is infinitely more appealing. But why resort to any stereotype at all? Frankly, I'm tired of monolithic stereotypes of any kind. Besides, isn't it hypocritical to beg for \\"diversity\\" on one hand, but insist upon \\"homogeneity,\\" on the other? (2) Kooden's over-arching theme is that gays should not operate by non-gay rules; instead gays should make their own rules as they go along. But what if everyone universalized this maxim, including militant homophobes? Then what? And while Kooden addresses the pressure to conform, such pressures within the gay community are often greater than those outside it. Beg to differ with gay \\"orthodoxy,\\" and you'll be called a \\"Nazi\\" and have something thrown at you. So much for individuality. (3) Finally, there's no insight from, and in fact several conflicts with, evolutionary psychology, which I found disappointing. For example, EP recognizes \\"youthfulness\\" as a biologically-inherited disposition for reproductive or sexual fitness. How does this scientific fact fit his new-gay-middle-aged-man model?

The novel consists of two parts: (1) rapprochement of two heart-broken, former lovers, (2) and a wild escapade they mutually take. Each is a seamless whole, so methinks this was originally two shorter stories that were later woven together. Given the very short time-frame, the plot is nominal, and has almost farcical feel to it. Necessarily, the dialogue, which carries the novel, is crisp and energetic.<br /><br />If the reader likes stereotypes of gay men, this novel will probably appeal: There's plenty of rage, sex, rage, momentary suspense, rage, camp, rage, drugs, rage, music, rage, movies, and even Derrida -- and did I mention rage? These are some mighty angry dudes. And apparently the only men these angry men find attractive are \\"blonds with honey hair.\\" They are almost as ubiquitous as the rage and the word \\"kitsch.\\" There's plenty of that too. The ending, well, let's say it does not end; it's left in the air.<br /><br />I hate to disagree with the dominant opinion, but I could barely get past the first-half of the \\"kitsch,\\" and, the second-half was only slightly more interesting, because it's so bizarre. The dialogue, of course, cuts in the author's favor (he's excellent), but I simply couldn't muster up all the ire and madness that this author tries to evoke. Yes, I've lived through the Age of AIDS, and it isn't pretty. Yes, like so many others, I continue to see friends and loves die, but I've never been THIS angry.<br /><br />After all, anyone familiar with evolutionary biology could have predicted a viral or bacterial attack though sex of some kind. It's in nature, for gawd's sake. Unfortunately, it was a damn sneaky virus that operates like none that has preceded or followed it, just like evolutionary theory predicted it would (see, Matt Ridley's \\"Red Queen\\"). Even though it's shown itself to be gender-neutral, maybe, just maybe, raw promiscuity caused it to spread so far, so wide, and so quick. So let's acknowledge some responsibility. I know this doesn't go over well with the author's ultra-left orthodoxy, and maybe that's why I could not generate his level of angst and retribution.<br /><br />While I have no tolerance for intolerance of the religious reich and the ultra-right wing, this kind of warmongering gets all of us nowhere.

It's about the influences of evolution on evolving understanding of a scientific human nature, especially how sexual differences evolved in various species. Surprisingly, 45% of Americans still disbelieve evolution, despite the theory and facts being supported by an overwhelming preponderance of evidence. This book, the author admits, will be of no interest to them.<br /><br />To everyone else, this book is a large window onto how evolution helps form a new, scientific understanding of human nature. It's the thesis of the book. \\"This book is an inquiry into the nature of that human nature. Its theme is that it is impossible to understand human nature without understanding how it evolved, and it is impossible to understand how it evolved without understanding how human sexuality evolved. For the central theme of our evolution has been sexual\\" (p. 4).<br /><br />The author himself best summarizes the first-half of the book: \\"Human beings are a product of evolution as much as any slime mold [and myriads of other plants and animals], and the evolution of the last two decades in the way scientists now think about evolution has immense implications for mankind as well. . . .evolution is most about reproduction of the fittest than survival of the fittest [the latter is not Darwin's, but Spencer's, coinage]; every creature on earth is the product of a series of historical battles between parasites and hosts, between genes and other genes, between members of the same species, between members of one gender in competition for members of the other gender. Those battles include psychological ones to manipulate and exploit other members of the species; they are never won, for success in one generation only ensures that the foes of the next generation are fitter to fight harder. Life is a Sisyphean race, run faster toward a finish line that is merely the start of another race\\" (p. 174). Most of these features involve non-humans as a way of understanding all of biological nature, not just human nature.<br /><br />The second-half is almost entirely devoted to humans, and it is certainly the most interesting and compelling. Some readers may get a little impatient with several of the earlier chapters dealing with microorganisms and ethology, but many of the necessary and salient points to be inferred and observed in human nature depend on this analysis. My strong suggestion is to persevere. You'll be richly rewarded.<br /><br />So what is a \\"Red Queen?\\" It's the theory of adaptation, or more specifically the adaptation of mutation to mutation that runs throughout all of life like a treadmill more than a like stair-climber. No sooner does A adapt to its environment, then B itself must adapt to A.

The second-half is almost entirely devoted to humans, and it is certainly the most interesting and compelling. Some readers may get a little impatient with several of the earlier chapters dealing with microorganisms and ethology, but many of the necessary and salient points to be inferred and observed in human nature depend on this analysis. My strong suggestion is to persevere. You'll be richly rewarded.    So what is a \\"Red Queen?\\" It's the theory of adaptation, or more specifically the adaptation of mutation to mutation that runs throughout all of life like a treadmill more than a like stair-climber. No sooner does A adapt to its environment, then B itself must adapt to A. In order for A to survive, it must evolve to A' and thus B must then evolve to B', and so on and so on, in an endless mode of adaptationism. It is precisely this theme that permeates all of this very interesting and provocative book. Highly recommended.	2005-08-31

I know that they've caused our test scores in science to drop precipitously, but I had no idea of their broader agenda. I thought innocently that most biblical fundamentalist sought refuge in their science-denying religion, because it comforted them. I no longer hold such an innocuous view.<br /><br />Maybe some \\"born-again\\" believers, I thought, were politically extreme, but they didn't really represent a threat to our country anything like the neo-Marxists and the ultra-Far-Left did. I am no longer so naive. The religious right has a theocratic agenda that should scare the devil back into all our lives. Under the umbrella of \\"doing God's will,\\" they intend to subvert our basic understanding of fairness, equality, and freedom into an agenda that would reconstitute the 318 biblical laws into our national fabric.<br /><br />What's even more distressing is how politically savy they've become. At least the neo-Marxists have been thoroughly discredited, except for academia perhaps. These people are infiltrating our school boards, city councils, the Congress, and now the White House with an agenda that would scare the Founding Fathers. Read this informative book, and I'll guarantee it that you'll be a tad freightened yourself. Not a book for the feint of heart.	2005-08-22

Ten years later, all but a few articles are still engaging. All of the authors take a \\"contrarian\\" point of view from the \\"normative\\" neo-Marxist, ultra-far-left, and counterculture stereotype of gays and lesbians. Some authors are conservatives, others libertarian, and still others Republicans and Democrats. Among them are Jonathan Rauch, Paul Vernell, Andrew Sullivan, and Bruce Brawer.<br /><br />They all malign the Left's hegemony of the unsuccessful efforts to secure equal, not \\"special,\\" rights for all Americans. They also question the \\"queer\\" counterculture that dares not assimilate. They also traduce the unfettered stereotypes often used to label all gays and lesbians by the Left's ultra-orthodoxy. These contributions overcome the myth that all gays and lesbians are of a monolithic kind or type -- e.g., in your face activists, drag queens, or leather-outfitted. Yes, the MSM, and even the gay press, like to flout the counterculture's flamboyance, but these authors argue that a significant portion of the gay and lesbian masses want nothing more than to live honest, fulfilling, and happy lives in much the same way that heterosexuals do.<br /><br />Essays include arguments against political correctness, for assimilation, and for inclusive marriage. There is much to cavil over, but the issues are more pressing today than ever. Both gays and straights can benefit from these reasoned, articulate, and intelligent essays.	2005-08-21

Dialogue and narrative are pretty evenly paced, and the storyline keeps the reader modestly engaged. Is it enthralling? By no means. Are there surprises? Only who really did it at the very end, otherwise everything is pretty perfunctory and matter of fact. We know the defendant didn't do it, and the suspicion cast on a third party is too obvious from the beginning to be the real culprit at the end.<br /><br />The storyline is simple: A separated defense lawyer, who has had a liaison with his former boss's wife, decides against a conflict of interest to defend her against charges that she murdered her husband. The rest is pretty much the ins and outs of the trial - and a few diversionary, inconsequential motifs about another client and the attorney's embittered wife. All in all, a fairly ho-hum read. I even considered ditching the whole enterprise about midway, but am glad I persevered. Will I read another Martini? Only the other one I bought at the same time, but I otherwise wouldn't bother.	2005-08-19

If one has only one book to read on morality and ethics, I cannot recommend a better book than Wilson's \\"The Moral Sense.\\" It's the first and, to my knowledge, the only, book that is a thoroughly modern, naturalistic, and intuitionist theory of ethics to date. The book begins with the challenge facing modern readers: Do we accept the total relativism of Rorty and other pragmatic academics who argue there is no moral sense whatsoever, or do we accept the polar opposite that only revealed religion or Kant's and Benthan's absolutist maxims give us a moral sense?<br /><br />According to Wilson, both extremes are to be avoided by conciliating the theory of moral sentiments advanced by David Hume, Francis Hutcheson, and especially Adam Smith in the 18th century with the theory of evolution advanced by Charles Darwin a century later. Wilson arrives at a thoroughly modern conception of human nature and what it means to have a natural moral sense without prescriptive religion or deontological maxims to guide us. It is a wonderfully entertaining and highly thought provoking book to read on what can sometimes be a dull subject.<br /><br />Obviously, modern moral developments have not all been positive. As Wilson observes, we've come to our senses about equality, fairness, and empathy towards others, but we may have left behind self-control and duty to others. I think he's absolutely on target. Unless and until we recognize that morality is not divinely-instituted, but rather empirically established by who we are by nature, and yes a Darwinian nature, then our moral sense will be always miss its target. All four: (1) Fairness, (2) empathy, (3) self-control, and (4) duty must operate concurrently for our morality to be balanced. Wilson's diagnosis of modernity is that they are imbalanced: We've largely omitted self-control and duty from our moral sense and become a tad bit self-absorbed (although recent developments may suggest otherwise).<br /><br />The first-third of the book rehearses the theory of moral sentiments and the applicable theory from evolution to establish the four \\"impulses\\" or \\"intuitions\\" of morality: Fairness, empathy, self-control, and duty. Notice these are universal, naturally-endowed impulses, not religious or philosophical maxims or prescriptions. We \\"intuit\\" these concepts, and from their application with our experience of family, friends, and society, we develop character. This interaction thusly develops a \\"conscience\\" to guide us. This is the substance of the second-third of the book. The last-third of the book explains how conscience (i.e., habituated character) forms affiliations, rights, and responsibilities. Here the author's adds his insights and applies them to a few case examples.<br /><br />The book is not flawless, but it is the most comprehensive, modern, and naturalistic book on ethics to appear in a single volume. That's a mighty claim, but I think it holds despite my criticism. I have two: (a) Wilson tends to be disorganized to the point of distraction; key concepts almost become ancillary. It's a problem of organization that could have been avoided by a matter of style. (b) The second criticism is a kind of sloppiness occurs in the final section: Besides trying to \\"humanize\\" his theory excessively, many of his personal reflections are too time-bound to be perennially relevant. These flaws would not be so egregious if the third section kept to a simple summary of key concepts; but instead of a simple summary Wilson addles between a summary and ruminations. Because the third section is perhaps the most expansive, these criticisms are all the more glaring.<br /><br />For these reasons, I think the reader would be well-served to precede this book with Matt Ridley's \\"The Origins of Virtue,\\" even though they cover some of the same territory. Ridley is a much more disciplined and focused author, whereas Wilson has a more expansive and developed sense of a intuitionist morality.If one can't read both - and if the reader is careful to focus on the key concepts rather than the supporting evidence and ancillary reflections - then this book is the one to get. Extreme relativism and extreme religiosity are no longer necessarily appropriate for an intuitional moral disposition. Moral balance, based on the four intuitions, are sufficient and necessary for a virtuous life.der is careful to focus on the key concepts rather than the supporting evidence and ancillary reflections - then this book is the one to get.

Finally, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurochemistry return as the hallmarks of the theory, bolstered by a high amount of \\"Neural Darwinism,\\" in order, \\"to formulate a specific hypothesis about the kinds of neural processes that can account for the fundamental integrative and informative properties of conscious experience.\\" The theory, known as \\"neuronal group selection\\" is a completely naturalist, wholly scientific, empirically-sated theory of consciousness. (Some knowledge of statistics will help, but is not necessary, for some middle chapters.)<br /><br />Rejected is Pinker's computational model of the brain (\\"How the Mind Words\\"). Gone are Damasio's dysfunctional subjects as counter-illustrations of the normative (\\"Descartes' Error\\" et alia). Gone too is Johnston's entirely solipsistic theory of mind (\\"Why We Feel\\"). Also ignored are the philosophical speculation and armchair conjectures one encounters in Chalmer's \\"The Conscious Mind,\\" Dennett's \\"Consciousness Explained,\\" and Penrose's \\"Shadows of the Mind.\\"<br /><br />Instead, Edleman and Tononi in \\"The Universe of Consciousness\\" respond to philosopher John Searle's demand for a strictly functional and biological account of consciousness (see, Searle's \\"Rediscovery of Mind\\" and \\"Mystery of Consciousness\\"). Among the some of the enigmas rejected is the representational theory of memory; in its stead is an associative and creative replicational theory of memory, which is dynamic and reacting to its environment always anew. If one learns anything from this book, it is that consciousness is not a state(s) of mind, but a complex, dynamic, and integrative neural process.<br /><br />This fascinating, detective-like examination of consciousness is not for the casual reader; this is a demanding and rigorous read: Concepts like perceptual categorization, memory reactivation, concepts, values, etc. that depend on a wholly Darwinian sense of developmental selection, experimental selection, and \\"reentry\\" (\\"the process of ongoing and recursive signaling between separate brain maps along massively parallel anatomical connections\\"), all combine with detailed neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurochemistry in order to substantiate the theory. The theory requires one's complete, but undivided, attention. It's a difficult subject, but masterful job.<br /><br />While the book is both exciting and a challenge, I admire the authors' ability to tackle a difficult task without complicating it with arcane, elliptic, or meandering conversation (cf., Pinker). This is an exciting, engaging, but very serious, book on a theory of consciousness. Where difficult concepts and biologies require, analogies are provided. Indubitably, \\"Universe of Consciousness\\" is the best written, empirical, biological, and conceptual account of consciousness I've read, and I've read more than a few. My only criticism, since it's warranted, is stylistic: The dense content could be helped by less-dense sentential structures.

The operative word here is \\"functional\\" and how we ordinarily apply truth-telling to the world we find ourselves in. Truth-telling is both normative and operative. Instead of philosophically dry truth values, Williams raises the question of \\"values of truth,\\" like sincerity and accuracy. Most of the book resides in describing ancillary aspects of this fictive state, as a running commentary on relativism in general, the importance of true-statements, and Rorty's pragmatic relativism in particular. Except for myopic humanities programs, the prevailing academic winds are no longer blasting behind William's opponents, so many of his arguments are dated and under-inflated. It's a very poignant exercise, but one that seems more tangential to the central theme than head-on polemics like Ellis' \\"Against Deconstruction,\\" Kripke's \\"Naming and Necessity,\\" Searle's \\"Social Construction,\\" and Hirsch's \\"Validity of Interpretation.\\" Primarily for philosophy students and libraries.	2005-08-05

I am rather surprised that Oxford University agreed to put its imprint on this volume as an \\"Oxford Reader.\\" The selections from pivotal ethicists, e.g., Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Bentham, and Sidgwick are ridiculously lowly, inconsequential, or scattered, so \\"coherence\\" is lost. Their minor pericopes omit their critical and vital insights; all their important ideas are egregiously overlooked. E.g., Aristotle's doctrine of the mean, eudaimonia, Kant's doctrine of Kingdom of Ends, Categorical Imperative, are just some of the major omissions. Natural law theory doesn't mention the name of Aquinas. The selections that support an evolutionary orientation are a little bit better. The selection from Hume on benevolence is marginal. The essays by Ayer and Wittgenstein are great, but not enough to justify this book. I can't imagine what this book is good for. It certainly fails as an introduction to ethics. It also fails as a current controversy in ethics. It might be used as an intermediate ethics course for some of the pericopes. To say this book is a disappointment is an understatement.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Singer is a utilitarian. I don't know how anyone in the 21st C. can use utilitarianism as an \\"ethic\\" much less as a system of \\"morality.\\" Scheffler, Williams, Nozick, et alia should have put this nonsense to rest, as Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, and even Hitler were great utilitarians, which is precisely the point. But that aside, I think it skews his editorial judgments as well. For ethics, Aristotle, for morality, Kant, and for benevolence, Smith and Hume. Otherwise, leave the utilitarian calculus for tyrants.	2005-08-04

Jonathan Rauch and Andrew Sullivan have written pro-gay marriage books, but unlike Wolfson's book, they approach the issue from ancillary perspectives (for example, how it will tame the flames of promiscuity among gay men). Whether these ancillary arguments are persuasive or not really does not matter, because they are not the core of the matter.<br /><br />Wolfson alone accurately makes equal access to marriage for ALL people a civil rights issue, and that is exactly where it belongs. Whether or not it curbs the promiscuity impulses among gays or not is largely irrelevant. If that happens, fine, but if not, so what?<br /><br />The Fourteenth Amendment and the Declaration of Independence are not heterosexually-specific, but universally-specific. All of us are entitled to the \\"pursuit of happiness,\\" no matter our color, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation.<br /><br />Mutatis mutandis, the same is true for equal protection under the law. People may continue to discriminate against minorities, but at least they cannot do so under the color of law. Denying a minority its right to marriage also discriminates, but when it does so, it does so with the color of law. That's wrong.<br /><br />All people are entitled to the same rights or they aren't. Denying any segment of the population this right because of their difference from the majority is simply unconstitutional and UnAmerican. Canada, Spain, Belgium, and Holland have righted the wrong.

The book's purpose is to include functional evolutionary explanations into ordinary medicine, a project that is only slowly coming to be. The key to unlocking so many mysteries behind so many diseases is to look beyond proximate causes and look instead for functional, often evolutionary, causes of disease and dysfunction. This requirement demands that we don't stop at signs and symptoms of disease, but that we understand how the disease disrupts the function of organisms. Only by a functional understanding of disease, which requires an evolutionary perspective, can we both prevent and treat disease more quickly, accurately, and thoroughly.<br /><br />The classic case is fever. Hopefully, we all know that most fevers are generally good for us (to a degree), namely that it is the body's own defense mechanism to raise the body's temperature to help kill pathogens. Some fevers, obviously, need to be treated with aspirin, but by doing so, you may actually prolong the disease. If we understand that fevers play a vital evolutionary role in helping us ward off pathogens, we'll not want to reduce a fever unless absolutely necessary (e.g., very high temperatures). Our body's own immune system is a marvel of evolution at work; and we need to learn to work with it, not work around it, much less against it. Certainly we ought not be taking antibiotics for viral infections, yet patients demand it, and doctors give in. There are health consequences to this slipshod type of medicine.<br /><br />If we understand, similarly, that being biped is relatively recent in our evolutionary history, and we understand how our visceral girdle is designed for quadrupeds, not bipeds, then the fact that so many of us get back pain should not come as a surprise. And, the more sedentary and unexercised this girdle becomes, the more prone to back disorders (e.g., herniated discs) we become. Part of the evolutionary scheme of things is preventative as well as curative, so rigorous exercise of our midriff girdle will do much to prevent back disorders resulting from flabby girdles. By taking the evolutionary function into account, we are better able to prevent as well as treat most disorders.<br /><br />These are just two examples of a plethora of diseases that, when given their functional aetiology, give a fuller account of what steps are necessary to keep us healthy and which steps are necessary to treat illnesses. The authors maintain that we must get to the true, real, and functional cause of most disorders before we have a real grasp of disease itself, thereby opening the door to both conventional and evolutionary prevention and treatment. I can't possibly do justice to the depth and breadth of this very important work. While I believe it should be in every doctor's library (like \\"Darwinian Psychiatry\\" should be in every psychiatrist's library), it is also one book most health consumers need to understand. Some parts are challenging reading, but it's worth it.<br /><br />I do have several criticisms. First, the book is not the finest in scientific writing for the layperson. Many doubly compound sentences (and subjects) would have been better developed with a shorter, simpler sentential writing style. Second, no footnotes; there are notes at the end of the text, and no bibliography. Third, the organization and presentation in the first part of the book could be better, with implications made explicit.

Rauch is a leading author and contributor to numerous magazines, including the prestigious \\"National Journal.\\" He is often identified as a \\"libertarian\\" and less often as a \\"conservative.\\" I consider Rauch to be one of the leading writers, gay or straight, in America today.<br /><br />This book is an appeal primarily to heterosexual conservatives to accept gay marriage, because it will tame gay promiscuity in favor of long-term relationships that benefit not only gays, but society as a whole, giving gays stable and safe environments. I did not find the case compelling.<br /><br />Why do people marry? The usual reasons are: (1) procreation, (2) mutual care, (3) love, and (4) benefits, although not always in this order. Rauch's argument centers on (2). Yet, obviously, each of these things, except (4), can be done without the benefit of marriage, so except for (4), these are NOT the reasons people marry.<br /><br />People marry because of (4) and (4) primarily. Only from the ontology of (3)  will come (1), (2), and (4) derivatively. This is the only logical reason people marry. I wish Rauch had made this argument, but he focuses instead on (2).<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, the case for gays marrying is simply a matter of justice, fairness, and equality under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. That's the long and short of it. All other considerations are ancillary. All but (4) are available to gays already; so all they want is (4) the benefits that attend to legalized marriage.<br /><br />Maybe this book will appeal to its target audience (conservative heterosexuals), but I thought it missed its mark.	2005-08-02

As I read through the consequences of all the tinkering government has done to our \\"mixed\\" economy, I grew increasingly alarmed at governmental intervention in every domain of our lives, both private and economic. As Hazlitt demonstrates in chapter after chapter, too little attention is paid to the long-term consequences of economic and political decisions. Over and over again, special interests get their way over the common good. When government steals from the taxpayer to reward special interests, the consequences are more like dominos than a straight win-lose transaction. It's time we all took long-term consequences into consideration before more damage is done.<br /><br />Take for example the \\"energy\\" bill that, as I write, passed Congress. With more than $10B in \\"financial incentives,\\" \\"tax breaks,\\" and \\"direct subsidies\\" to oil producers, all this measure does is (1) further increase our dependence on oil, (2) continue our reliance on foreign imports, and (3) further delay the time when alternative fuels are used to replace polluting gases into the environment. What's temporarily good for the oil companies is not good for the rest of us over the long haul. So, this \\"energy bill\\" will take $10B out of taxpayers' pockets and line the oil companies pockets so that the cost of gasoline will go down. Does this make sense? We pay either way, obviously.<br /><br />Take another example: Rent control. I live in a city that has had it for over 20 years. Not one new apartment complex has been built in all those years. Not one! In addition to rent control, the city has imposed a moratorium on houses over three-storeys tall. While population is exploding, housing is scarce and affordable only to the extraordinarily wealthy. Meanwhile, I pay half the rent my neighbor next door pays, but I couldn't afford to \\"move up\\" because there are no new apartments to choose from! They also are occupied by \\"sitters\\" under rent control. The poor have already moved out, and now there's an exodus of the middle class. San Francisco is only for those under rent control or the very wealthy who can afford million-dollar homes. All because of two policies meant to help the public: (1) Rent control, and (2) building moratoria.<br /><br />Capitalism, obviously, is not a perfect system, but it certainly is the best system compared to the alternatives. Hazlitt, while showing the deficiencies of the alternatives, does not address some of the crucial problems with capitalism itself. Take for example wealth. The rich capitalist can afford to take risks, while the middle class can't afford much risk at all, and the poor are lucky to survive. How does one break out of  the vicious circle of haves and have nots? Otherwise, the rich stay rich, the poor stays poor, and everyone remains financially the same. Only venture capitalists, who already have the money, can offer those who don't some chance of improving their lot. Is this the only way to get ahead?<br /><br />Even with questions like these unanswered, this is an important book and a critical read for every citizen. We all need to think \\"ahead\\" and not just think provincially. We must think of the \\"domino\\" consequences of all our temporary fixes. They usually beget more problems than they solve. Hazlitt tackles them all: Public works, taxation, foreign aid and \\"credit,\\" bureaucracy, spread-the-work schemes, the export-import disputes, tariffs, pricing parity, saving obsolete industries, ignoring the pricing system, stabilizing commodities, minimum wage, inflation, and others.

We all need to think \\"ahead\\" and not just think provincially. We must think of the \\"domino\\" consequences of all our temporary fixes. They usually beget more problems than they solve. Hazlitt tackles them all: Public works, taxation, foreign aid and \\"credit,\\" bureaucracy, spread-the-work schemes, the export-import disputes, tariffs, pricing parity, saving obsolete industries, ignoring the pricing system, stabilizing commodities, minimum wage, inflation, and others. All under 200 easy-to-read pages. Highly recommended.	2005-07-30

But none of them compares to the insights given in this book: An anthropological point of view based on a synthesis of field research, evolutionary psychology, and evolutionary biology. The author uses the methodology known as reverse engineering. The book is truly revolutionary in its approach and truly magnificent in its insight.<br /><br />There is much information about evolutionary psychology and biology, most of it coming in the second-third of the book, and very little of it redundant (kin selection and reciprocal altruism do rear their usual heads). The first-third of the book, however, is devoted entirely to a new anthropological approach of religion based on the Modern Synthesis. The author pleasantly surprised me by starting with anthropological concepts first, giving his conclusions second, followed by his hypotheses and their evidence. He admits to reversing the usual and customary order, but what a pleasant surprise not to have to wade through more of the same evolutionary concepts to get at the book's core insights.<br /><br />Those core insights are in the first-two chapters. They are: (1) Ontological Categories, (2) Inference Systems, and (3) Violation Tags. With these three concepts, Boyer is able to explain all religious experiences and phenomena from all walks of life - from the animist beliefs in Africa to Christendom in Europe, with almost every other religion in between. My only complaint is that evidence from Christianity is thin, whereas evidence from Fang religion seems over-dominant. But everything that applies to the one also applies to the other, so maybe the author deliberately chose to minimize Christian concepts (familiar to most of the West) in favor of African, South American, and Indochina religions (where concepts, rather than prejudice, might shine).<br /><br />I'll try to do justice to these three keen insights. We come into this world with certain Ontological Categories (templates) that help us Infer anew with each experience (not unlike Aristotle's and Kant's Categories of earlier times). He cites only a few Ontological Categories, such as PERSON, ANIMAL, PLANT, etc. With each new experience, the mind's inference systems \\"tack on\\" one of these templates of pregiven understanding to synthesize old-with-new experience. This insight, of course, is not new to Steven Pinker readers, but it is presented in a refreshingly vibrant, concise, and new manner, and without Pinker's computational model of consciousness. Ontological Categories are contrary to the \\"blank slate\\" or tabula rasa of old; rather they, or something like them, are innate genetic dispositions.<br /><br />How and where religion acts on human experience is by its \\"Violation Tags.\\" Such \\"tags\\" violate our normal experience with hybridization: Experiences are partially rooted in natural phenomena and partially rooted in unnatural or contrarian phenomena so that they become mythical or \\"supernatural,\\" where just enough novelty is created to allow belief in the unusual, but not too much bauble to cast aspersions on the whole artifice. A certain intuitionism is involved, inferring that these tags cause us to accept overlapping Ontological Categories. The rise of these simultaneous concepts give us most of our religion.<br /><br />Boyer cites numerous examples, but I'll use one with which I am most familiar: \\"virgin\\" and \\"birth.\\" We have ontological categories of psychological inferences of what it means to be a virgin and what it means to give birth, but religious phenomena are exactly those experiences where our Ontological Categories are Violated by Tags of our Inference Systems just enough to create a supernatural experience (e.g., demigods; disembodied spirits; part human, part animal phenomena; etc.). We can only accept the notion of a Virgin Birth, for example, because it is a violation tagged ontoour pregiven, ontological categories (virgin, birth) and violated only within bounds of our psychological inference systems: Something we can conceive and therefore are able to adapt into our lives without being so preposterous as to be totally incoherent. Such things almost always violate the laws of nature, but that's precisely what these religious phenomena intend to do. That's why they're \\"supernatural.\\"<br /><br />After this tour d' force for an introduction, Boyer returns to familiar evolutionary concepts but in a wholly new psychological or anthropological perspective. Phenomena like \\"beliefs,\\" \\"ritual,\\" \\"death,\\" \\"spirits,\\" \\"doctrine,\\" etc. are explained in the context of being ontological categories distorted ever so slightly by out psychological inferences with violational tags to create the supernatural. We all do it, some more than others, some with more sophistication than others. Why we do it still remains a mystery, but that we do it no longer is.

It is a complicated affair, definitely not for beginners.<br /><br />It begins easily enough, placing the locus of practical reasoning in the emotions rather than in ratiocination. The Dionysian and Apollonian dichotomy persist throughout the book. But the chapters take a contorted twist around a variety of subjects (theory of language, modal logic, theory of mind, prisoner's dilemma, choice theory, etc.) before once again resuming in Chapter Seven to the focus adumbrated in Chapter One. Those interested in a highly Anglo-American analysis will not want to miss these intervening chapters; those less inclined may omit chapters 3-6 without detriment.<br /><br />I came to the book already disposed to sentimentalist ethics, and I come away all the more convinced. But if one is not already familiar with Hume's and Smith's theories, not to mention Aristotle, Kant, and at least Mill, one will feel a definite disadvantage. Everything needed for Blackburn's arguments are fully entailed, but not in the nice, crisp, lean fashion I like. He's too chatty and redundant for my tastes. Indeed, the book could easily be reduced by half, making a more coherent case.<br /><br />One of the clear deficits of the book is Blackburn's failure to distinguish how \\"utility\\" plays an important role in Hume's account, but is deliberately denied in Smith's account. I think there is much for fruitful discussion on this distinction that goes entirely unnoticed. Besides the mentors, there are plenty of devotees: Wittgenstein, Ryle, Koorsgard, Rorty, Hare, Moore, Ramsey, Sidgwick, et alia. And, besides choice theory, sociobiology makes an appearance (where Dawkins gets scored). All in all, in interesting, but hardly, provocative work.	2005-07-22

He's obviously familiar with his subject matter, but he lacks the clarity and lucidity these other authors have. Still, his prose is better than average, and most readers with a college-level education should be able to follow his narration. For those who prefer, his NOVA program on PBS (available on DVD) was far more coherent and clearer than his book.<br /><br />The first few chapters are devoted to the classical dilemma posed by the incongruity of quantum mechanics and Einstein's theories of relativity. The former describes the microscopic world, whereas the latter describes the macroscopic world, but the two cannot be used to describe the other. Gravity has no place in quantum mechanics. This quandary is the raison d'etre of this book.<br /><br />After the first chapters rehearsing classical physics, the remainder of the book is devoted to solving this quandary: Superstring theory, the unobserved, indirectly postulated existence of one-dimensional loop strings are posited as the most fundamental building blocks of the entire universe - the cosmos as well as under the microscope. Yes, once it was the atom, then the proton and electron, then the neutron, then the graviton, then the muon, quarks, etc. Now it is the superstring.<br /><br />Let me (and the author) be clear: The postulation of superstring theory is just that, a theory. No evidence exists for their existence, only indirect implications based on experiments and mathematical equations. This is similar, yet distinct, from the postulation of black holes. At least black holes can be inferred from indirect empirical evidence, and from the fact that only lighted objects are visible, together with the behavior of nearby cosmic activity. Superstings are even a greater stretch. No one has seen, or is likely ever to see, these \\"strings.\\" That doesn't mean they don't exist, but it doesn't mean that they do either. That \\"stings\\" have never been seen, nor have predicted any outcome, the two hallmarks of science, should all give us pause.<br /><br />But, if one posits the existence of these ubiquitous unseen superstrings, then Euler's mathematical equations (rediscovered 200 years later by Venezlano) seem to comport with something like the superstrings' existence. And, viola, put Euler's mathematical equation together with the postulation of one-dimensional vibrating strings (rather than particles) as the smallest, most fundamental unit of creation and one can overcome the problem between quantum mechanics and gravity. But at what price?<br /><br />There's only one problem: With string theory, has physics ceased being a science and reached over into metaphysics? Euler's equation rescues string theory from total metaphysical speculation, but Greene et alia's insistence on positing something unseeable as foundational of all matter and energy isn't without it's own set of metaphysical suppositions. Some might not find this problematic, because string theory finally does provide a unified theory of everything. Yet, somehow the question arises.<br /><br />The author admits that the theory is still in its nascent stages and needs further support. By reading (or watching) Greene's hypotheses, one will at least be on the frontiers of modern physics.an that they do either.

As a self-help book, I found other self-help books to be clearly superior: E.g., Albert Ellis' \\"A Guide to Rational Living,\\" and Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\"<br /><br />Burns' book is good, but these two other books are substantially better. According to CBT and REBT (which is a variant of CBT), our pattern of thinking often leads us into depressive moods and high anxiety. Retooling our thinking process does much to alleviate moods and reduce anxiety. Obviously, endogenous depression still requires medication, but many people who experience exogenous depression are apparently able to avoid all medication with the help from these books. For that reason alone, these books are goldmines.<br /><br />Our destructive thinking, whether or not one is depressed or anxious, often leads us into blind alleys and self-destructive behavior. Burns', Cohen's, and Ellis' books make great strides in helping one overcome the destructive thought processes by helping one think more critically. By shining light on our thinking process and how to think critically, many people's depression and anxiety are significantly assauged.<br /><br />What these the Cohen and Ellis books lack, Burns appropriately provides: Probably the best general information on antidepressant and antianxiety medications in print. If you are on, or are considering, antidepressant or antianxiety medications, Burns' book is one of the best lay resources available.<br /><br />Surprisingly, many physicians who prescribe these medications lack the basic information that Burns fortunately provides. He distinguishes between SSRIs, TCAs, MAOs, etc. (Don't worry if you don't know these acronyms. Burns explains them thoroughly, and just as importantly, provides profiles of their side effects.) No naive patient of antidepressants ought overlook this very helpful book.this very helpful book.	2005-07-18

More suppositions exist than theories, and those suppositions are based on highly dubious inferences. Damasio has obviously thought long and hard about his dysfunctional patients, and the fact that he wants to ground consciousness and emotions in neurobiology (as opposed to computers) gave me optimism and a tinge of excitement. Unfortunately, obfuscation prevailed.<br /><br />Extrapolating hypotheses based on brain deficits and damage is one among many inductive means of substantiating theory. The problem, of course, is that exceptionalism usually doesn't define, it may, and I underscore may, posit evidence to support a hypothesis. But it is only one means of support. Just because the street is wet doesn't mean it just rained; someone could have watered the area with a sprinkler. It's this kind of reasoning that is most troublesome with Damasio's theories. By supposing that someone who lacks X must be caused because someone sustained Y doesn't entail that non-Y illustrates Z. Just because someone who suffered damage to frontal cortex lobe can't emote hate doesn't necessarily entail that the wholesome frontal cortex lobe is responsible for all emotions of hate. A correlation may or may not exist, but taking abnormal cases to instantiate normal cases is a spurious kind of inductive reasoning that permeates Damasio's \\"The Feeling of What Happens.\\"<br /><br />This kind of thinking leads to all kinds of problems. Because of curious abnormal instances, Damasio posits a need for three levels of emotion: primary, secondary, and background emotions. These distinction appear necessary because Damasio can detect in the laboratory of human psychological dysfunctions continue to operate in the presence of other human normal physiological functions. A correlation may or may not exist, but are abnormal cases instantiations of normal ones? Does the fact that certain physiological processes continue to operate in the absence of psychological ones indicate that the same qualitative emotion exists, but only on a different level? Either emotions exist in some sort of normal fashion, or otherwise produce examples from normal cases to substantiate theories of why a tripartite set of emotions is necessary. Why posit three levels of emotive activity, when one will clearly work (the scientific notion of parsimony)?<br /><br />This same example can be leveled against Damasio's three levels of self and consciousness because of a disorder known as associative agnosia. So instead of positing consciousness as consciousness, Damasio posits the Proto-Self, Core Self, and Autobiographical Self which doubles for core consciousness and extended consciousness after the proto-consciousness. Whether all three levels of consciousness and self are really necessary depends on two things: (1) On Damasio's injured or ill patients as counter-examples of what normative existence entails, and (2) whether such an architecture serves to explain and predict what science ordinarily sets out to establish.<br /><br />Let's just look at what Damasio's Proto-Self is intended to do. It is \\"a coherent collection of neural patterns which map, moment by moment, the state of the physical structure of the organism in its many dimensions\\" (p. 154). But by \\"neural patterns\\" he means only the \\"trigeminal nerve, the vagus complex, and the area postrema\\" (p. 155). Excluded are the \\"inferotemporal cortices, namely areas 20, 21, part of 37, 36, and 38\\" (p. 157). Let's take the obvious. What in the hell is Damasio describing? Maybe a neurochemist or neurobiologist knows what he's talking about, but I sure couldn't follow it. Second, we are told that it's not to be confused with homunculus. That's a relief. But whatever the Proto-Self is, \\"we are not conscious of the proto-self\\" (p. 174). So if we're not conscious of something nonconscious,how does it play a role in consciousness? By its physiological, not psychological, underpinnings?<br /><br />Besides confusion, incoherence egregiously pervades the narrative beginning with Chapter Six. I became a bit suspicious of all the distinct levels of emoting, thinking, selves, etc, very early on, but I wanted to give Damasio an opportunity to explains his polysemous biological brain. But by Chapter Six, the book figuratively fell apart for me. By then clarity lapsed into ambiguity, polysemy lapsed into confusion, and the \\"Feeling of What Happens\\" lost all its interest. Sadly, not recommended.<br /><br />Postscript: A 2006 New Yorker article describes hemispherectomies, the removal of entire halves of the brain. The practice is widely used in different conditions, usually involving seizures. The remarkable (and totally anti-Damasio) thing is that these people not only survive these radical surgeries, they usually resume ordinary day-to-day functions. According to Damasio's exceptionalism, the return to \\"normalcy\\" should not or cannnot happen. If the \\"location\\" of brain function is X, the removal X removes the corresponding function, according to Damasio, and thus that part of the brain cannot allow \\"extremities\\" to function. Removing entire halves of brains seems pretty radical and that surgurical \\"victims\\" survive is itself incredible, that they resume \\"normal\\" functions blows Damasio's entire hypothesis of particular brain functions out of the water.

Just look at the number of books on the market that portend to do this task, and it becomes obvious that not all authors succeed in their efforts. Some manuals attempt to teach by rules, others by persuasion, and still others by example. This book takes all three approaches and illustrates that the art of stylistic writing is a matter of know-how. Unlike most books in the field, I find this one generally successful.<br /><br />The book's method is heuristic. It begins with causes of bad writing, and progresses to clarity, cohesion, emphasis, coherence, concision, length, and elegance. Each principle is given a bad examples compared to a good one. Direct, subject-verb-object writing is extolled, and certain anathemas of other texts are approved under the right circumstances. While I disagree with one its principles: That it is acceptable to begin a sentence with \\"There\\" and \\"It,\\" these are minor quibbles in an otherwise strongly argued case.<br /><br />Strunk & White's \\"Elements of Style\\" now has a major competitor, and this book is it. Whether one writes in fiction or non-fiction, the principles and examples given throughout this book are to be commended. I know of one author, a philosopher, who took these principles to heart. What once was ambiguous and contorted writing is now lucid, clear, and vivid. If this book can make this kind of progress, I certainly recommend it to all writers.<br /><br />While on the subject of good writing, I also recommend Corbett's \\"Classical Rhetoric\\" for those authors who want to write convincing arguments. One on style, the other on substance. While William's book on style will make prose more readable, Corbett's book will make it more intelligible.	2005-07-12

In that book and in other similar books since (e.g., Johnston's \\"Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions,\\" 1999), evolutionary biologists have shown that the adaptative function of emotions is to get us moving very quickly without having to rationalize or think about imminent perils as we had to do in our earlier hunter-gather society. In 1995, Daniel Goleman in his pioneering book \\"Emotional Intelligence\\" brought many of these evolutionary and scientific ideas to the attention of modern readers, advocating much greater attention be paid to developing healthy emotions in all of us, beginning in grade school and in the home. Now, Goleman returns in a book that highlights a symposia consisting of philosophers, psychologists, doctors, and the Dali Lama to see what insights Eastern thought in general, and Tibetan Buddhism in particular, might glean for us. The effort, while noble, has very little to recommend it.<br /><br />Most of the book tangentially describes the goings on of the symposium itself; hardly electrifying knowledge! The rest of the book tries to correlate (where possible) Eastern Buddhist thought about emotions with the modern Western scientific paradigm. Often, this is no more than using Tibetan language for English terms. The neo-Darwinian prototype is occasionally raised, but never fully addressed. Then, in a systematic fashion, the emotions, affects, afflictions, emotional balance, etc., are described in a metaphysical context of how the Dali Lama and other lamas regard Western insights. Some spiritualists, transcendentalists, Eastern philosophers, and religionists may find the Dali Lama's comments insightful, but I found them bordering on the naive and over simplistic. Don't we already know (in the West, at least) that some emotions are healthy while others are simply inappropriate? It doesn't require new semantics in old wineskins to show us what we already know.<br /><br />There's no question that some of the emotions we've developed over epochs of evolution no longer serve our modern-day purposes (although this isn't even explored). Further, there's no question that some people have either excessive or deficient emotions that could benefit from a reappraisal and some reeducation. For example, while anger in some people may precipitate compassion for the injured or harmed (a good effect), others blow off steam with weapons, familial abuse, and inappropriate agitation (bad effect). So, what's new about this insight? Nothing. Goleman does devote a chapter to writing about \\"schooling\\" the good effects from bad, but I found the reeducation slender and lanky (e.g., \\"our secular goal should be to support a healthy emotional immune system\\"). The analogy and metaphor are quaint, but not very descriptive or prescriptive of the reeducation program.<br /><br />Emotions, according to most scientists as opposed to the doctrinaire religionists, are generally regarded as a normal and healthy part of our intrinsic human nature (see Johnston, supra., Pinker, \\"How the Mind Works,\\" Wright, \\"The Moral Animal,\\" Ridley, \\"Origins of Virtue,\\" Sober & Wilson, \\"Unto Others,\\" et alia). For those who suffer from inappropriate emotions, and obviously many people do, there are excellent self-help books (e.g., Cohen, \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" Ellis, \\"A Guide to Rational Living,\\" Nussbaum, \\"Therapy of Desire,\\" Burns, \\"Feeling Good,\\" et alia).

He deliberately tackles six classical ideas and gives reasons for their importance. For the non-specialist, these six essays may provoke interesting discussion and dialectic, or perhaps starting points for further inquiry.<br /><br />Such topics as beauty, truth, justice, etc. often have been lost in philosophy for the narrower, Anglo-American analysis of propositional logic. That doesn't means Adler's ideas are useless or less interesting, but they aren't the type of topics one encounters in most academic philosophy departments, for good or ill.<br /><br />Of all Adler's books, this is far my least favorite. It concerns itself with essences, something that has given way to Wittgenstein's \\"family of resemblances.\\" Talking about \\"essences\\" is antediluvian, unless, like Adler, you're an Aristotlean. Reading about such abstract concepts -- the six great ideas, is rather like talking about \\"red\\" with someone. There's not much one can really do or say about \\"red,\\" except to point out examples. I'm afraid that Adler has boxed himself into a corner by pursuing such absract concepts like \\"liberty\\" as if it were any different than \\"red.\\"<br /><br />It's not that I oppose Adler's good intentions; I really wish his kind of philosophy was more visible, tackling some of these important concepts in an intellectually rigorous manner. But ambiguity raises its ugly head, and the student of philosophy is left bereft of very important philosophical concepts.<br /><br />Tackling enormous concepts without intellectual rigor seems rather useless and pointless. Thus, two stars for effort, but really no stars for success. Yet, if one really wants a place to start his or her inquiry, this little book may be of singular importance.	2005-07-07

It was written about the same time as David Hume's and Francis Hutchinson's theories of moral sentiments (theory of benevolence) in the 18th century, departing from the ancient ethical paradigms of a priori ethics and reaching instead toward an empirical, a posteriori ethics for modernity. Rather than deducing first principles from the philosopher's armchair, Smith's account begins with experience, habit, and custom based on nature's disposition of mankind's moral constitution. Therefore, it is a wholly modern theory, and in many ways anticipates Darwinism and evolutionary biology (EB).<br /><br />Smith's ethical account is grounded entirely in observation. Nature, custom, habit, and experience teach us its principles, which comports with both our internal judgments and our external evaluations. By our imagination, we place ourselves as if we are the other person, conceiving ourselves as if we were that person. Our emotions well up with an \\"analogous emotion\\" of the other, vicariously experiencing the other's pleasures and pain, his gratitude and resentment, becoming sympathetic to the other's plight as though it were our own. Love and gratitude are agreeable sensations, while hatred and resentment are disagreeable passions. Our sympathy for the other is measured like that of \\"an impartial spectator\\" who we become by viewing another's motives and actions by our own in accordance with our own sense of propriety, moral sense (duty), and benevolence, by \\"bringing the case home to ourselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"Every faculty in one man is the measure by which he judges of the like faculty in another. I judge of your sight by my sight, of your ear by my ear, of your reason by my reason, of your resentment by my resentment, of your love by my love\\" (I.i.3.10). \\"We approve of another mans judgment, not as something useful, but as right, as accurate, as agreeable to truth and reality\\" (I,i.4.4). Conscious of another person's situation generates sympathy in ourselves, and the correspondence with one another, is \\"sufficient for the harmony of society\\" (I.i.4.6). \\"To feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature . . . .as to love our neighbor as we love ourselves is the great law of Christianity . . . . as our neighbor is capable of loving us\\" (I.i.5.5).<br /><br />Based upon these primary motives of gratitude and resentment (foreshadowing Trivers' and Hamilton's reciprocal altruism in EB) leads to an analysis of grief and joy, anger and love, suffering and enjoyments, distress and relief, envy and magnanimity, and all the other binary emotional relations. To each emotion we attach a \\"proportionable recompense\\" for merit and demerit, reward and punishment. A sympathetic imagination or indignation naturally boils up in the breast of the impartial spectator.<br /><br />While beneficence is always a free act, we do have duties given us by nature in order to be just. Justice, writes Smith, is a negative virtue and only hinders us from harming our neighbor through retaliation or punishment \\"to safeguard of justice and the security of innocence.\\" Even though we are primarily motivated by self-love, we imagine an impartial spectator to humble the arrogance of self-love to avoid hurting one's neighbor.<br /><br />Smith makes clear that \\"man, who subsist only in society, was fitted by nature to that situation for which he was made,\\" and that is to act reciprocally. For ill inflicted unjustly on another, we naturally seek retaliation; for the good afforded from love, we reciprocate the affection. After all, \\"society cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another\\" (II.ii.3.3). This occurs \\"for the purpose of advancing the two great purposes of nature, the support of the individual, and the propagation of the species\\" (II.ii.3.5). When it comes to society, justice is more important than beneficence, because, while society can live without beneficence, it cannot survive without justice. Nature, and society through habit and custom, implant conscience in the human breast, and every injustice, therefore, alarms man. Conversely, Smith observes, \\"mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent\\" (II.ii.3.7).<br /><br />Like Hume before him, Smith locates the causes of pain and pleasure as being behind the primary motivations of the two chief emotions: For Hume they are love and hatred, for Smith they are gratitude and resentment. To measure the propriety and duty of one's own actions, \\"we must become the impartial spectators of our character and conduct\\" (III.2.2). Man is naturally endowed to live in society with a desire to please others and avoid offending others, and it is our duty to impartially evaluate ourselves at least as stringently, if not more, than we evaluate others. Nature has made man the immediate Judge of mankind, ever making proper comparisons between our own interests and those of other people. We judge ourselves best when act as if we stand in a place with eyes of a third person. \\"It is reason, principle, conscience, the inhabitant of the breast, the man within, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct\\" (III.3.5). Of course, our own disciplined, self-command, coupled with constancy and firmness, makes our interior and exterior comparisons and resemblances fair and equitable.<br /><br />Smith's TMS covers much territory also covered by Hume, but from a different angle, and with a different regard for \\"utility\\" in a theory of benevolence. Both theories are thoroughly modern, and readers familiar with EB will find that Smith better anticipates many of EB's themes, i.e., reciprocal altruism, kin selection, etc. Smith's perception of man as he will become described by Darwin is uncanny. Although Hume's account begins with first principles of observation, and heuristically builds upon empirical foundations, Smith's observation begins with the more mundane and ordinary and refines toward first principles. Even though they are in agreement on most matters, it's intellectually interesting to take note of their differences (e.g., utility).

He writes with the layperson in mind, as if philosophy mattered to the laity, and it does!<br /><br />Adler is not a \\"professional\\" philosopher, but that doesn't make his contribution any less worthy. Indeed, because of its accessibility and wide terrain, this is an engaging dialectic for most of the prominent philosophers from Plato to Nietzsche, One ought to keep in mind, however, that Adler at his death was a Thomist, and was an Aristotlean when he wrote this short volume. Expect, therefore, the criticisms of the philosophers chosen, e.g., Descartes, Locke, Hume, et alia, are skewered because they don't toe the Aristotlean party line. Despite his bias, Adler is fair in his criticisms.<br /><br />Lamentably for Adler and his students, modern philosophy has made significant leaps since this book was written. Take the positive assertion that Locke's tabula rasa is right. Well, modern evolutionary biology, psychology, and congnitive science have disproved the tabula rasa theory. So, Aristotle, Aquinas, and Locke's \\"blank slate\\" notion no longer is true; defending it against the wealth of scientific experience opposing it isn't even a feature of this book.<br /><br />So, who's this book for? Any beginning student of philosophy can benefit from Adler's reformation of some arcane, philosophical arguments in the language of the layman -- e.g., ordinary language. If one wants to know the fundamental flaws of the Empricists, for example, Adler adumbrates them. But before taking Adler's criticisms too seriously, be sure to compare them to current scientific thinking.	2005-07-07

(false)<br /><br />Even the non-logician can detect the fallacy of this argument. The premises do not lead to the conclusion. But even the premises are highly-charged ad hominems, rather than factually true.<br /><br />The book begins with \\"a\\" definition of \\"epicureanism,\\" but Epicurus was no epicurean in the odd, polemical definition Wiker gives. The age-old misconception that Epicurus was a hedonist has been debunked by numerous philosophers (e.g., Nussbaum, \\"Therapy of Desire,\\" Princeton). Indeed Epicurus is not even quoted for his real views; his biographer Diogenes Laertius is substituted in his stead. Worse yet, all the claims attributed to \\"epicureanism\\" are straw man claims. For example, Wiker writes (not quoting Epicurus, but just asserting): \\"Epicurus's second reason for advocating asceticism [is] a rather peculiar one. The greatest pleasure, he claimed, was the absence of pain.\\" Peculiar? What's so peculiar about the maxim to avoid pain? Nothing at all. It's straw man claims like this that permeate the book.<br /><br />The second premise: That Lucretius is a scientific materialist commits the fallacy of anachronism; scientific materialism was not even in existence until two centuries ago, so how could Lucretius, living 18 centuries ago, be something that didn't exist in his lifetime? If Lucretious were alive today, would he have been a scientific materialist? Perhaps, but to posit an anachronism as fact is a fallacy.<br /><br />The third premise is tautologically true. So what? Scientific materialism (or naturalism -- a word Wiker avoids) is a sound, empirical, biological theory. Just because it ranks up there with quantum mechanics as scientific theory doesn't make it the boggyman Wiker wants it to be.<br /><br />But the conclusion doesn't follow from a single true premise, and doesn't follow as a matter of logical form either.<br /><br />Besides being illogical, Wiker is being disingenuous. You see, this book is an attempt to discredit Darwinism by trying to show it leads to immoral consequences, namely hedonism. How is a scientific theory, in itself, either moral or immoral? Obviously, scientific theories are neither moral nor immoral. As R. Nesse and G. Williams in \\"Why We Get Sick\\" write: \\"Darwinism gives no moral guidelines how we should live\\" (p. 12). But, if Wiker can misconstrue Darwinism and Epicurus enough, he thinks he'll succeed in banishing Darwinism to the dustbin of history. Wiker's periphrastic polemic may appeal to biblical literalists who advocate creationism, but it repeatedly makes intellectual error after error doing so.<br /><br />There are, in fact, several ethical theories that can account for Darwinism (virtue, deontology, utilitarianism), but there is one theory known as benevolence that Wiker targets. It was a theory advocated by David Hume, Adam Smith, and Francis Hutcheson a century before Darwin, and it comports with the empiricism of science. Indeed, Wiker is aware of it, but gives a deviously deformed account of Hume's theory by taking the quotes and statements out of context throughout Chapter 8.(the half quotes, multiple ellipses, and no footnotes are a dead give away). Smith is only mentioned once in passing, and Hutcheson is altogether ignored. Is that giving benevolence a benevolent interpretation?<br /><br />Ironically, Adam Smith uses the Golden Rule as a key theme of his moral theory, if only Wiker had read Adam Smith's \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments.\\" But Wiker and company are so frightened of Darwinism that they'll commit any travesty, including illogical form, fallacy after fallacy, false premises, out-of-context quotes, and intellectual dishonesty to portray Darwinism in the worst possible light. Is that the principleof charity? I think not.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention the Is/Ought Fallacy? Just because we \\"value\\" something (i.e., hedonism, or pleasure) does not make it a \\"natural fact,\\" and a natural fact does not constitute an inherent value. Hedonism is self-evident: Pursue pleasure, avoid pain. But that axiom is only part of the theory, and Epicurus was an ascetic by our standards, which Wiker has not a clue.<br /><br />Obviously, this seriously flawed book is a intellectual travesty and cannot be recommended.se we \\"value\\" something (i.e., hedonism, or pleasure) does not make it a \\"natural fact,\\" and a natural fact does not constitute an inherent value.

What we see is probably different from what we expect.<br /><br />First, it's important to distinguish \\"homosexuality\\" from its practice in antiquity to what it is today. In Greek culture several centuries before Christ, homosexuality as we know it today did not exist, except in Sparta. While Dover does not make this as explicit as he could, one cannot read the extensive material Dover covers without forming this conclusion. In Greek antiquity, the relationships were more oriented toward man-boy relations rather than man-man relations. Identifying these man-boy relations as \\"homosexual\\" is certainly tendentious, at best.<br /><br />Second, the \\"mentoring\\" that older men functioned for their younger devotees in exchange for the devotee's sexual favors is in stark contrast to anything \\"homosexual\\" in our own age. Indeed, today we more likely to lock the older man up in prison for paedophilia, rather than extol him for his service of introducing younger boys to upper Greek society. The cultural context of Athens is anything but homosexual, but truly something else.<br /><br />Third, the ubiquity of the man-boy pattern (primarily around Athens) as opposed to the man-man pattern (primarily around Sparta) illustrates another distinguishing form of \\"homosexuality\\" in antiquity. The historian must go where the artefacts are, and the artefacts are not from Sparta, but from Athens, where the man-boy paradigm prevailed. The book's title might have been more appropriately been retitled \\"Athen's Paedophilia\\" rather than \\"Greek Homosexuality.\\"<br /><br />Dover's account is both exhaustive and replete. His historian's viewpoint reports the facts and artefacts dispassionately as his discipline allows, but it might seem to many a bit too confining now that other histories have subsequently appeared. (For an excellent history of homosexuality over the ages, I heartily recommend Crompton's \\"Homosexuality & Civilization\\" by Harvard University Press.)<br /><br />If one's purpose is a limited understanding of sexual mores as it was practice in Athen's antiquity, then this book certainly achieves that goal. However, this book really isn't a \\"gay\\" or true \\"homosexual\\" history at all. It's only by a stretch of definition that man-boy sexual and social enculturation in Greek antiquity really reflects any \\"homosexuality.\\" If this limited scope is your interest, then this is really the best book of its kind. But if your interest is more broadly \\"homosexual,\\" then Crompton's book is the one to turn to.too confining now that other histories have subsequently appeared.

They state psychiatry is in disarray, with numerous theories and postulates, but no guiding theory upon which to form a model grounded in science. To rescue psychiatry from this abyss, they recommend that Darwinism be used as the new model that not only grounds theory in fact, but provides a clearer correlate between functional diagnosis (signs and symptoms) and suitable treatment (e.g., psychotropics and/or counseling). Does their new paradigm succeed? I'm convinced.<br /><br />The book is short, a mere 270 pages. It's not intended as an introduction to psychiatry; in fact it presumes a significant acquaintance with most psychiatric concepts. The book intends that these given concepts be reexamined in light of Darwin's theory. Such concepts discussed in this context are: natural selection, adaptation, function, ultimate causation, individual fitness, self-interest, reciprocal altruism, proximate mechanisms, development, traits, learning, culture, and history strategies. The authors' approach is centered in a functional analysis of behavior that gives causal hypotheses and provides from assumptions that conditions will be more meaningfully classified and their contributing factors more rapidly identified (p. 81). Outward behavior gives events that are usually terms of separate genetic, physiological, and psychological mechanisms turn out to be subparts of infrastructures that contribute to specific functions (p. 92).<br /><br />They state categorically: \\"Evolutionary models of mental conditions differ from psychiatry's model in a number of ways. Most critically, they are based on a theory of behavior that includes ultimate causes, biological motivations-goals, sexual selection, infrastructures, trait and trait variation, and the social environment. Proximate even6ts, such as genetic mistakes, predispositions, adverse environments, psychosocial stress, wrong or inadequate learning, dysfunctional physiological systems, and intrapsychic conflicts are sometimes, but not always, part of the explanation. Viewed this way, many conditions turn out to be minimally adaptive; some turn out to be adaptive, and some features of conditions represent attempts to act adaptively\\" (p. 149). The first half of the book explores these concepts in general, while the second half explores individual conditions such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, dysthymia, etc.<br /><br />For example, \\"behavioral states, traits, and events are that (1) others' behavior initiates infrastructural activities that have physiological, psychological, and behavioral consequences; (2) interaction sequences can be viewed as functional units; (3) typical interaction sequences are often consequences of compromised infrastructures; and (4) inferences about infrastructure functionality can be made through the observation of behavior and its function\\" (p. 98). It's Number 3 that distinguishes this text from others in psychiatry. When the authors discuss moods, for example, they understand them as the failure to accurately process emotion-terminating feedback information optimally or functionally. The (in)ability of the species to adapt to its environment is key to understanding its (dys)function.<br /><br />Two caveats. (1) This book must be read in sequential chapters, as each chapter builds upon the former. Moreover, the technique the authors use is heuristic, which builds their theory from the ground up. The authors find the methodology in DSM-IV unsuited for their purposes, and so begin with different first principles. Thus, in order to understand mood disorders, depression, and anxiety, one must first understand the Darwinian concepts of kin selection, reciprocity, survival, and reproduction presented under Theory of Personality. So, don't expect to go to the chapter on Depression and understand it solo.<br /><br />Second, (2) while this book is written for and by professionals in the psychiatric field, its benefits and accessibility apply to all in the mental health professions. I have neither a degree in the field nor am I acquainted with some of the theories, disorders, and treatments discussed, but I found the authors' arguments and case histories easy to follow. Indeed, their lucid clarity, heuristic approach, and polished style make their theories stand out vibrantly. I also appreciated its concision. And, unlike so many other works under the appellation of evolutionary psychology, this text actually uses mental conditions to explicate its Darwinian precepts. I have a much clearer idea of what depression is and what kinds of intervention are best suited to treat it from an evolutionary perspective.

Yes, the authors are poor writers (poor-to-bad punctuation, spelling, and run-ons abound); there's no question that the authors did not consult a style manual before writing some tortuous sentential structures. Even some key scientist's names are misspelled. But despite these obvious flaws, the authors explain evolutionary biology quite thoroughly, even if, or rather because, it is meant as a textbook.<br /><br />But taking some of the chapter and section highlights, look what's covered under one set of binding:<br /><br />Chapter One: The Roots of Evolutionary Psychology<br />--Darwin's Theory<br />--The Modern Synthesis<br />--Behavior as a Function of Evolution<br /><br />Chapter Two: From Big Bang to Big Brain<br />--Life in the Universe<br />--The Beginning<br />--Vertebrate Life<br />--Hominid Evolution (Africa, Bipedalism, & First Humans)<br /><br />Chapter Three:; Encephalization and the Emergence of Mind<br />--The rive Movers in Hominid Encephaization (Machiavellian Intelligence, Ice Ages, Ballistic Hunting, Language, & Intraspecific Competition<br />--The Modular Brain<br />--The Modular Mind (Fear Learning, Social Reasoning, Gender Differences<br /><br />Chapter Four: Language<br />--The Nature of Language (Animal Communication, Animal Language Studies, & Feral Children)<br />--Language Acquisition (Developmental Stages, Critical Periods)<br />--Language Evolution (Universals, Ancient Origins, Conceptual Domains)<br /><br />Chapter Five: Mating and Reproduction<br />--Sexual Selection (Sex Differences, Mate Slection Criteria)<br />--Aesthetics of Attraction (Symmetry, Waist-Hip Ratio, Masculine Ideal, Feminine Ideal)<br />--Human Pheronomes (Menstrual Synchronicity, Major Histocaptibility Complex Preferences, Male Pheromones, Female Pheromones)<br />--Jealousy and Mate-Guarding<br />--Sperm Wars<br />--Sexual Orientation<br />--Pair-bonding Strategies (Limerence and Long-term Pair Bonding)<br /><br />Chapter Six: Ontogeny<br />--Prenatal Development<br />--Postnatal Development (A Priori Mind, Parent-Infant Conflicts, Incest Avoidance, Evolved Contingency Mechanisms, Optimizing Cognitive Potential, Adaptive Function of Menopause)<br /><br />Chapter Seven: Social Order and Disorder<br />--Dominance Hierarchies (Affiliation and Aggression & Biochemical Status of Mood Disorders)<br />--Evolution of Compassion (Kin Selection, Reciprocal Altruism, & Universal Morality and Ethics)<br /><br />Chapter Eight: Personality and Psychopathology<br />--Early Personality Theorists<br />--Contemporary Personality Theories (Case-Study, Trait, and Factor Analysis)<br />--The Three-Factor Model<br />--The Five-Factor Model<br />--Evolutionary Theory of Personality (Adaptive Significance & Phylogeny and Ontogeny of Personality)<br />--Personality and Abnormal Behavior (Axis I and Axis II Disorders)<br /><br />Chapter Nine: The Creative Impulse<br />--Tool Use (In Nonhumans, Hominid Archeology, Tool-use as a Selective Force, Hominid Cognitive Ability)<br />--Aesthetic Manipulation (Pleistocene Art, Adaptive Art)<br />--Consciousness and the Symbolic Universe<br /><br />Chapter Ten: Ancient Mammal in a Brave New World<br />--Mismatch Theory<br />--Stree: Then and Now<br />--Mental Health<br />--Indoctrination, Nationalism, & War<br />--Psychoparmacology (Substance Abuse & Pharmacology)<br />--The New Eugencis: Genetic Engineering<br /><br />As one can see, almost every conceivable topic of evolutionary and psychological importance is covered in a single volume of about 250 pages. Admittedly, some features are not as well covered as I might have liked. For example: The distinction between altruism and reciprocal altruism is conflated, and the subsection on stress hormones identifies not a one. But these quibbles are minor compared to the magisterial accomplishment of having all these features in one, consolidated volume. And other than E. O. Wilson, this is the first volume I'veencountered where sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective is addressed, even if it's in paltry terms. Nothing is more counterintuitive to evolutionary biology than the persistence of homosexuality. The authors explanation may fail, but at least they don't avoid it.<br /><br />And unlike some modern populizers of evolutionary biology and psychology, this book gives the facts and nothing but the facts. People used to other populizers' (Pinker for example) invasive and extemporaneous inputs might be bored by the lack of mindless interruptions, but I appreciated the straight-forwardness of this volume. As one who looks critically at evolutionary biology to explain human behavior, I appreciate this direct and unconvoluted approach.

I'm delighted to find that Ayer (one of the original Vienna Circle members and a progenitor of the logical positivist movement) isn't entirely enthralled with LW either, and for many of the same reasons. Besides being cryptic and disorganized, Wittgenstein is often opaque, ambivalent, and subject to much confusion and misinterpretation.<br /><br />Ayer in this short work uses the principle of charity in always giving LW the benefit of doubt. When polysemy occurs, which it often does with Wittgenstein, Ayer always chooses the most favorable interpretation. Even given this advantage, it is often the case that LW's arguments, even when understood in the most favorable light, are just simply counter intuitive, or they're illogical. or they make a categorical mistake (to borrow a phrase from Gilbert Ryle).<br /><br />That's not to say that Ayer is not a little cryptic himself (his writing skills are notoriously poor). Many of his propositions have to be reread in order to understand the context and meaning of his propositions. But this complaint aside, Ayer takes on LW on a number of fronts: Often it's just a matter of the examples LW uses; otherwise it is a frontal attack on private language, the way language works, how the mind functions, the problem with following a rule, the picture theory of language, etc.<br /><br />Ayer's discourse is civil, recognizing that Wittgenstein, despite  all his faults, is enormously important for understanding the linguistic turn that all the humanities took in the 20th century. But the complexity of LW's arguments, which David Stern claims repeatedly are reductio ad absurdum, still go against our basic intuitions. It does, after all, make sense to talk about a private language in several senses (although I confess LW is using it in a special sense).

Let's face it: \\"The Philosophical Investigations\\" and \\"Tractatus\\" are not the easist reads -- even for the professional. Stern compares and contrasts Wittgensteins early and later thought, honing in on how his later thought reversed some of his earlier thinking. And, unlike so many other Wittgenstein interpreters, Stern has researched the philosopher's massive, and oftentimes confusing, unpublished notebooks, manuscripts, typescripts, and diaries, in addition to the usual published primary texts, to present a coherent, logical, and detailed analysis of Wittgenstein's thought. Stern is to be congratulated for his polished, clear, and unambiguous writing, a feat not often accomplished by philosophers. Highly recommended for both novices and scholars.	2005-06-20

He succeeds masterfully. Indeed, Ridley's \\"The Origin of Virtue\\" succeeds in a way that Robert Wright's \\"The Moral Animal\\" fails. Whereas Wright focuses only on the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary biology and molecular genetics, Ridley incorporates both and adds ethology, comparative psychology, sociology, politics, economics, game theory, and paleontology. Wright's scope is myopic, whereas Ridley's scope is expansive. The outcomes could not be more radically different.<br /><br />I dismissed Wright's book - not because it failed to explain Darwinism (it does so very well)  - but because it failed to provide any moral insight from the Modern Synthesis. Ridley does not make this mistake: He takes homo sapiens as we are, both one with Nature, yet tellingly distinct and unique as a social and rational species. Ridley does this by using a broader armamentarium from which to analyze the origins of human virtue. Consequently, Ridley accomplishes far more than Wright in half the space and time..<br /><br />Ridley's territory is too sophisticated and nuanced to be summarized into several single propositions. But he leaves no stone unturned, examining a plethora of human dynamics, i.e., the innate characteristics with which we are born, the usual pattern of development after our birth, and what is factual about the real, rather than the metaphysical, world. Suffice it to say that reciprocal altruism, kin selection, unit cohesion, symbiotic collaboration, ostracism, imitation, contextualism, emotion, trade, personal property, and mutual trust all dovetail along with reason to produce a distinctive human reality.<br /><br />While homo sapiens may be grounded in nature and motivated by self-interest, accepting these facts does not condemn us to a Hobbesian state of affairs. As Ridley poignantly observes, individual and collective interests break apart only when we are coercively removed from our finer instincts. We are not a blank slate, after all, but born and nurtured to do remarkably virtuous things. Ridley advocates no particular ethical theory, but shows what a theory must provide in order for it to be commensurate with our being human and to be compatible with our original innate predispositions. Wright [supra.] advocates a utilitarian ethic, not because of some intrinsic feature of utilitarianism, but, well, just because. It's no surprise then that the ethical theory Ridley most respects is the theory of moral sentiments espoused by David Hume, Adam Smith, and Francis Hutcheson in the eighteenth century. The link could not be more obvious: The theory of moral sentiments reflects on our empirical selves and how we are disposed to act towards others based on our own self-interests with benevolence.<br /><br />Just because humans are genetically, physically, and biologically predisposed to act one way rather than another doesn't make such a predisposition ethically normative. Ridley avoids the naturalistic fallacy. His interdisciplinary account is intellectually and emotionally satisfying, because it draws on a plurality of disciplines to sort out our ethical origins and intuitions. Even though one does not get a complete ethical, political, or economic theory from Ridley, the implications are clear. For a fuller explication of his ideas, the reader will need to consult David Hume's \\"Treatise on Human Nature,\\" Part III, or his \\"Enquiry into the Principles of Morals;\\" or Adam Smith's \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments;\\" or else Francis Hutchinson's numerous ethical essays. The political and economic implications of Ridley's account favors the writings of F.A. Hayek's \\"Constitution of Liberty,\\" and other classical liberals.<br /><br />At least Ridley opens the door between the Modern Synthesis and ethical, political, and economic theories. Hedoes not have an overriding agenda (as in the Sociobiology debates), but clearly and articulately examines human nature from manifold perspectives - all grounded in empirical evidence. The result if refreshingly honest and candid; now it's up to us to decide what to do with this evidence.

Sadly, those who would benefit the most are the very people who decry the MS in its entirety -- the Creationists. Alas, that's everyone's problem. As E. O.

This is a historian's view of ethical thought since the time of Darwin. It recapitulates the undramatic evolution of ethical thought, primarily utilitarianism, in the light of evolution theory. It contains not an iota of original ethical thought, and the thought most akin to evolutionary theory, altruism and reciprocal altruism, is barely acknowledged. What is seriously missing: Hume, Smith, and Hutchinson (Francis, not Woods) and their very similar theories of moral sentiments, despite their point-on-point relevance to altruism and reciprocal altruism.<br /><br />I'll be the first to acknowledge that evolutionary theory presents new ways of looking at moral problems. Moreover, I'll concede that Social Darwinist misused evolutionary theory to advance their fascist regimes in times past -- and maybe we're still vulnerable. But moral philosophers have not been hibernating; they've been looking for an appropriate paradigm to fit the Modern Synthesis. Where are their accounts? Nowhere in this book!<br /><br />Some older moral philosophers, e.g., Spencer, Huxley, Sidgwick, and Green, have unsuccessfully tried to incorporate old ethics in the new bag of wine. Robert Wright in \\"The Moral Animal\\" faced a similar dilemma (the two books were released at the same time), and Wright was found wanting. But at least Wright tried to envision a new paradigm. Farber concludes that maybe evolutionary theory isn't so great after all, because it leaves us morally bereft. What?<br /><br />Maybe I am too much of an optimist not to believe that new problems can be solved. It just takes a little intuition and a more expansive notion of history. And I know many people are scared by the shadow of eugenics and other Darwinian misappropriations, but fatalism is not the answer. Had Farber only gone a little farther back in history, just a century, he could have found a nice fit between moral theorists and evolutionary theorists. On the most important parallel in human history, Farber is asleep. Not recommended.sleep. Not recommended.	2005-06-18
US	52996207	RD7VOLDTE3A4B	0393318486	218150245	How the Mind Works	Books	3	46	55	N	Y	How the Mind Acts, NOT How it Works	Pinker's \\"How the Mind Works\\" is an interdisciplinary tome, relying on linguistics, computer science, philosophy, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, history, and evolutionary biology. It is supposed to be a strict Darwinian account of how the mind works. Does it succeed?<br /><br />Yes and no. On the level of explicating mental functions and psychological behavior along a computational theory of the mind, I believe the book fails. By explicating behaviors from a Darwinian perspective, the book generally succeeds. The Modern Synthesis (the combination of Darwin's theory of evolution and Malthus' theory of genetics) has no fiercer advocate than Steven Pinker, although he can be sloppy about it sometimes (for example, calling Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness [EEA] as ancestral history, when the two are not synonymous). Still, his explication of human dynamics from intelligence to emotion to sociability onto religion from the new paradigm of the Modern Synthesis is literally encyclopedic. This last point is also both a positive and a negative; oftentimes Pinker's claims are obscured by all the tangential information he loads onto them, such as experiment after experiment, jokes, television programs and movies, lyrics, personal experiences, and a host of other qualia.<br /><br />Disagreeably, Pinker's believes in the computational theory of mind. Pinker is known as a \\"Strong Artificial Intelligence\\" (SAI) advocate. He frequently oscillates between the \\"mind is a computer\\" and the \\"mind is like a computer.\\" While clearly not identifying the human mind as computers, he believes the two things, computers and minds, do exactly the same thing: They both \\"compute.\\" Well, that's partially true, and partially false.<br /><br />He draws on a number of other SAI examples to illustrate how and why the modern computer is an excellent tool for exegesis of his computational theory of the mind. I have no problem with using the computer to explicate things, but when Pinker claims the mind and the computer are doing the same thing, I have a problem. To use my own analogy: Language has both a syntactical and semantic content; the two can be divorced from each other for analysis, but both are required to produce real ordinary language. What the computational method illustrates is that the mind is akin to language's syntax, but showing parallel construction doesn't illustrate the mind's understanding of meaning (e.g., semantics). While an association exists between mind and computer, it is at very most a Weak AI analogy, not a SAI correspondence.<br /><br />Another example is Pinker's rejection of connectionism or associationism, which he derisively calls \\"connectoplasm.\\" First, he sets up a straw-man argument by claiming the British Empiricists identified two features of connectionism: (1) resemblance and (2) contiguity. But Pinker fails to include the third feature (3) causality. Causality is a critical feature of connectionism, whether or not you accept connectionism's application to how the mind works. After ten pages of counter-examples, all the reader knows is (i) Pinker sets up a false dichotomy, and (ii) then gives no reasons, just counter-examples, of why connectionism fails. I agree with Pinker that connectionism as he's constructed it cannot do all the work Pinker or I want it to do, but then don't set up false dichotomies, and then furthermore fail to explain how the counter-examples demonstrate a failure.<br /><br />A final example is Pinker's examination of \\"consciousness,\\" something which is arguably either existent or not. It may just be a hangover from Cartesian dualism, a category without substance (see, Dennett, \\"Consciousness Explained\\"). Although Pinker can neither describe nor explain it, he wants to hold onto it for reasons he says will be apparent at the end of the book. While I kept waiting, I was also kept wanting. Consciousness is something we ascribe to our mental state of affairs, but Pinker offers no resolutionas to why or how come. From Pinker's point of view, I can see no reason to hold onto it (although I still do).<br /><br />For all the strengths of the book, especially issues concerning reciprocal altruism, emotions, and religion, the overall argument is too diffused to make too much of what is arbitrarily dismissed. These are just a few of the many defects that pervade the book. Too many out-of-hand dismissals of contrary theories do NOT make Pinker into a forcible advocate of HIS point of view. Other  annoyances are his lack of Notes -  no ordinary footnotes or endnotes, just notes. And of these, most are too broad to serve any useful purpose other than to avoid plagiarism. There is no Glossary (which, given his change of nomenclature, would have been useful), and the index at it stands is primarily name-oriented, not subject-oriented.<br /><br />Despite these critical reservations, and despite a number of other books that avoid his mistakes. I still think Pinker is worth reading. It's one thing to think that one has an explanation to \\"describe how\\" the mind works, it's another thing to think that one can simply \\"describe why\\" the mind works like it does - at least from a Darwinian perspective. Description is not exactly causal (see, supra.), and the problem of causality resurfaces throughout the book. While I agree that \\"regressive-engineering\\" is a useful model for describing human behavior, it is not as exclusive or as exhaustive as Pinker seems to think.resolution as to why or how come.

I admit that Chalmers presents some interesting ideas, but the conclusions based on his premises just don't make sense. He's forced to conclude both the untenable: (1) dualist framework and (2) functional framework, hypostazed, that, while being true to his logic, results in absurd conclusions (like panpsychism and inanimate objects are information processing things, including a consciousness). But the most troubling aspect of his argument is that it explains nothing. Obviously, there must be a causal relationship between neurobiology and various states of consciousness. That's been the problem since the problem of the mind resurfaced some twenty years ago, and Chalmers offers nothing but illogical premises that lead to valid, if not preposterous, conclusions. He explains nothing of how the biological-physical account of the brain causes consciousness, or vice versa. In fact, there is no causality explained at all, just descriptions of various hypotheses that seem to suggest functional organization \\"gives rise\\" to consciousness. But, it simply doesn't. And what about his \\"dualism?\\" I thought most philosophers were on the same page with scientific materialists in rejecting the mind/body distinction and all other dualisms. I admit that sometimes we have \\"deep-level\\" and \\"shallow-level\\" explanations, that differ epistemically, from one another, but they are ontologically at least consistent in a monist explanation of how things on the micro- and macro-level work. There's no discussion of this at all! All Chalmers does is marry computational functionalism with property dualism, and this is supposed to be a theory of consciousness? Is the mind really nothing more than identical to computers and how they function? If so, why can we have \\"pain,\\" whereas they don't. And, how come we can be \\"depressed,\\" \\"elated,\\" \\"conceptualize,\\" etc., and they cannot? Is the computer paradigm really suitable for \\"grounding\\" human consciousness? I think not.<br /><br />I won't detail all the problems I had with Chalmers account, other than reiterate that there is something important missing (consult Searle's \\"The Mystery of Consciousness\\" for elaboration). But beyond his strange ideas (implied panpsychism, \\"conscious\\" inanimate objects, etc.), he really is not a very good expositor of his own ideas. It takes him 40 pages to explain \\"supervenience,\\" which another author did in a paragraph. I think this convoluted prose occurs anytime an author follows the logical rigor that Chalmers does to the absurd conclusions he reaches. He's definitely logical, but the absurd conclusions based on faulty premises HAD to lead him into this corner. Sorry, there's nothing about this book that I can recommend.

His contention that \\"consciousnes\\" is observable along a two-fold structure is substantively true: (1) from the scientific materialist point of view of the independently verifiable third-person perspective, and (2) from the immaterialist point of view of the unverifiable first-person perspective of things like \\"pain.\\" But unlike most other contemporary theories of consciousness, Searle's it's not either/or, but and/both, and almost no one else is taking note of this. Those philosophers that are, are coming up with preposterous theories along the way. Searle wants to reposition them back into the life science of neurobiology, not their arcane logic, bogus epistemology, or reductivist materialism.<br /><br />Let's begin with the obvious. Both perspectives are \\"verifiable\\" from the first-person point of view: We all know and agree that the first-person experience of pain, the notions of governments, the rules of inference, and other subjective \\"qualia\\" occurs (\\"qualia\\" is just a marker for individual conscious experiences). While we can and do measure some mental phenomena by (1) their third-party reports, such as someone carrying an umbrella likely thinks it's going to rain, we have trouble when we come (2) to first-person sort of qualia, e.g., what it is like to feel \\"pain,\\" what one means by the phrase \\"good government,\\" who is the \\"best painter,\\" what I mean by \\"red\\" house, I feel depressed, etc.<br /><br />According to the scientific materialist, \\"only\\" those third-party reports qualify scientifically. You know the scientific paradigm: Only that which is verifiable and not falsified is true. That's fine, except what does one do when the \\"activity\\" that people report is going on in that amorphous, first-person, thing called \\"consciousness?\\" Do we deny that people have it, such \\"pain,\\" that we don't have a conception of the \\"best government,\\" that we don't know what they mean when they say \\"I feel depressed,\\" etc.? Well, according to Searle, one has to accept this consequence if the current theories of consciousness are on track. According to the current paradigms, all first-person reportage is spurious or nonsense or (in the case of Dennett) non-existent.<br /><br />Searle's defense of \\"naive naturalism\\" is a defense of all our basic intuitions. Per Searle, most of what has been written recently is contrary to these intuitions, and Searle exposes them all. It's not a pretty picture in how Searle portrays others, and they evidently have not taken to kindly to it. But it is a defense of what we think to be basically true. Upended are a myriad of characters, some lightly, some not so lightly. Besides Dennett, there's Chalmers, Penrose, and Churchland. Searle may be tactically off to the wrong start, but he's definitely on the right track. There is definitely something wrong with postulations that \\"consciousness\\" does not even exist (Dennett), or that if it does exist (Chalmers), it does so in some extreme form that doesn't even mirror want we know to be true. It's either too scientistic or too dualistic, but whatever the method, it's on the wrong foot.<br /><br />Searle's intuitions are certainly right, even if his modus operandi has begotten him ill-will (esp. Penrose). For those wholly unfamiliar with \\"consciousness\\" as Searle minimally conceives it, consult his \\"Rediscovery of the Mind.\\" Even without that prefatory work, his arguments in this book still have cogent force and conviction. Searle's conception of what it is minimally to have \\"consciousness\\" may be off track \\"here and there,\\" but his basic intuitions are obviously and instinctively on track.<br /><br />For the sake of science, the understanding of the mind, and of what constitutes and explains \\"consciousness,\\" I hope all Searle's detractors take this neurobiological polemic to heart. Searle is right to argue that methodology doesn't outweigh reality, and whatever the methodology for the study of consciousness, let's hope philosophers get in line behind neurobiologists, who, along with psychologists, know that \\"intrinsically first-person ontology\\" exists when it comes to consciousness -- even if scientifically, it doesn't fit the paradigm. It might not fit the classical materialist paradigm, but things like \\"life\\" and \\"consciousness\\" just don't. Densely, but articulately and cogently, argued. Highly recommended.hope philosophers get in line behind neurobiologists, who, along with psychologists, know that \\"intrinsically first-person ontology\\" exists when it comes to consciousness -- even if scientifically, it doesn't fit the paradigm.

I had tried to access philosophy of mind through David Chalmers and Roger Penrose to no avail. Talk about arcane and inane philosophy! Then, I decided I might try something \\"lighter.\\" What a difference Searle's dense, but clear, ideas make! This book is a great place to begin (or end) one's enquiring into the philosophy of mind, and a treasure trove of so much that is intuitive. So much in the field of conscious is counterintuitive that it is refreshing to read someone who subscribes to one's intuitive beliefs.<br /><br />First, like most philosophically-minded individuals, I like to think philosophy of the mind is not so arcane and inaccessible that we ordinary individuals can't get it, e.g., Penrose, Chalmers, et al. At least Searle treats the reader like educated adults without unnecessary obfuscation. Don't misunderstand me: This is dense reading, and hardly a sentence passes without something important being claimed. But, rather than being unintelligible, it is wholly intelligible. For example, Chalmers tries to explain supervenience over 40 pages, Searle explains in one paragraph. Not simple, but clear and unadulterated exposition.<br /><br />Second, some other readers must have omitted the Preface and First Chapter. This book is intentionally polemical; Searle makes it clear from the outset. He adamantly opposes some of the philosophical and psychological paradigms currently in cognitive science, and he addresses those problems in the first few chapters (and throughout the book). He opposes dualism and materialism of all sorts and admits that he is a \\"naive naturalist,\\" whatever that is. His arguments are often contentious, as he admits up front. But as tendentious as he is -- there's a lot riding on the premises and conclusions of others, so in the end he has to highly contentious. Fortunately, he's also persuasive.<br /><br />Third, as a \\"naive materialist,\\" Searle argues that the simultaneous firing of neurons and existent mental states (hence the phenomenon \\"consciousness\\" is irreducible to anything further) are causally interchangeable, because they are the same phenomenon. Ergo, consciousness is not epiphenomenally, nor occurrently, nor simultaneously, but epistemically, empirically, and ontologically foundational (each a different property of the same phenomenon). This is an important, and liberating, concept, forcefully argued throughout the book. What's inimical about all the other concepts Searle fights is their use of the homunuclus fallacy and their anthropomorphizing of physical processes.<br /><br />Fourth, he make the claim for a number of other intuitive, contra counterintuitive, claims. For example, the \\"unconscious\\" just does not make any sense. It almost seems like a contradiction, and according to Searle it is. As Gertrude Stein once said, \\"There's no there, there.\\" Again, I've always thought this to be linguistically intuitive, now he makes a broad-based argument against its existence even morphologically (and several more things like \\"universal grammar\\" \\"binary intelligence,\\" etc.).<br /><br />Finally, I believe this book is necessary reading by all interested in consciousness and the mind. Even if one doesn't agree with his arguments and their conclusions, it's highly important to know and understand them. And because Searle is so accessible, he's a refreshing, indeed cogent, alternative to some of the myopic, convoluted, and constipated thinking going on in the field.al states (hence the phenomenon \\"consciousness\\" is irreducible to anything further) are causally interchangeable, because they are the same phenomenon.

Wright is an excllent author; \\"The Moral Animal\\" is on par with his \\"NonZero\\" and his excellent essays in \\"The Atlantic\\" and \\"The New Republic.\\" He is a master in the authorial class.<br /><br />But this book is a bust and failure. After more than three-hundred pages of reiterating Darwin's theory of evolution (superbly, I might add), and complementing the original with subsequent developments (brought out better in his book \\"NonZero,\\"), this book actually \\"deals\\" with the \\"moral\\" aspect of animals in a matter of a few dozen pages. That's all!<br /><br />After explaining evolutionary biology in exhaustive terms, (much as he does again in \\"NonZero\\"), Wright concludes that morality is NOT a part of the evolutionary scheme of things. Moreover, since we are \\"physically,\\" \\"biologically,\\" and \\"genetically\\" determined, there isn't much point to being moral other than it might help our ability to aid Darwinian \\"reciprocal altruism.\\" In other words, it may not help being moral, but it certainly doesn't hurt. That's encouraging!<br /><br />Then by fiat he announces his preference for utilitarian ethics (\\"rule\\" or \\"act\\" utilitarianism, it doesn't matter), even though some of the best-known utilitarians, e.g., Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, etc., might not be its best advocates. No kidding! So why choose utilitarianism? Apparently because Charles Darwin and J. S. Mill, besides being cotemporaries, were good friends, and it's just as good a system as any, and as far as ethical systems go, it's no better or worse than any other. The point is just to be \\"nice\\" to one another for the same reason that it might mirror reciprocal altruism.<br /><br />Thus, after an excellent exegesis of Darwin's theory, spanning more than 300 pages, we come to the title of the book, to find out that (1) evolutionary theory does not support any reason for humans being moral animals, (2) besides, we are \\"determined\\" in all sorts of ways anyway, (3) so the best we can do under the circumstances is acknowledge that \\"determinism\\" and \\"reciprocal altruism\\" are biological and genetic facts, (4) yet, being \\"nice\\" to other people \\"may be\\" a way of aiding reciprocal altruism, (5) so being nice to each other is certainly not harmful, and might even aid reciprocal altruism (although this is probably defeasible by our biological fatalism), (6) so why not choose an ethical system as \\"modern\\" as Darwin himself, (7) which is to say \\"utilitarianism,\\" (8) despite the fact that some of the most famous and ingenious utilitarians have used it for nefarious purposes.<br /><br />Seriously: This is the book's thesis. There's no discussion of why utilitarianism is to be preferred over virtue, denotic, Stoic, or sympathy ethics; or why \\"act\\" rather than \\"rule\\" utilitarianism is to be preferred, or that it matters anyway in the face of \\"determinism.\\" In fact, other theories of morality aren't even mentioned. The best humans can hope for is that some ethics is probably more helpful than none, or at the very least, ethics, while maybe not helpful, certainly isn't harmful. In any event, humans are NOT moral animals (in the biological sense, at least), and while it seems that being \\"nice\\" is often helpful in a generic sort of way, it is, according to nonzero game theory, probably a win-win thing to do.<br /><br />Obviously, I cannot recommend this book for any reason, not even for its excellent exegesis of Darwinianism. His \\"NonZero\\" is just as good, and has a much better thesis (that evolution is directional in simplicity evolving toward complexity).

Using archeology, paleaeontology, human history in broad scopes, game theory's zero-sum and nonzero-sum outcomes, kin versus individual selection, Richard Dawkin's memes from his book \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" and a posteriori logic, Wright tackles the issue directly, concisely, forcefully, and elegantly.<br /><br />His answer to the question, in contradistinction to his Marxist antagonists like Gould (See the sociological critique \\"Defenders of the Truth\\" by Ullica Segerstrale for sociobiology's reprecussion in academia), is that the evidence points unquestionably to the nonzero sumness outcomes of organisms to develop from the simplest to more complex organisms, implying at least a \\"directional\\" undercurrent in sociobiology rather than simple \\"random\\" effects that his nemeses posit. This conclusion inevitably suggests the subsidiary question whether evolution is teleological -- that is, directed to some ostensive purpose or goal (which he rejects, but not without empathy for those who find oppositely). On his principal argument and the evidence he evinces for it, however, Wright is consistent, coherent, logical, and persuasive.<br /><br />Three caveats: (1) his notion that natural selection's directionality from simplicity to complexity seems to suggest \\"progress\\" towards some higher purpose leads Wright to argument unconincingly for a one-world government about midway; (2) Wright, as masterful though he be with the facts and prose, is not a scientist and does not hold himself out to be; but he amply draws from primary and secondary sources to support all the evidence necessary to make his directionality of natural selection very compelling. (3) All evolutionary scientists insist that natural selection is entirely random, so this theory, plausible as it might seem, is contrary to science.<br /><br />One annoyance: This highly documented work is supported with a peculiar \\"note\\" system that is simultaneously confusing and awkward. The ubiquitous \\"dagger\\" instead of individual endnotes or footnotes is highly aggravating.<br /><br />Finally, one has to ask, Is Wright's thesis really important to an understanding of ourselves, and if so, how? I found his directionality thesis of natural selection both compelling and important in that there is \\"progress\\" in a very generic sense, but did not find Wright's politial and economic \\"solutions\\" interposed midway supported by any evidence, but was sort of an ad hoc notion from his own political biases (see his articles in the New Republic magazine and elsewhere). I actually found the opposite conclusions to be supported by the supposition that biodiversity to be the impetus behind natural selection's constantly undergoing improvements and balancing of traits.<br /><br />\\"NonZero\\" is an important, well-written, and scientifically supported case for natural selection's inherent directionality from simplest to the more complex organisms. Being at the top of the evolutionary pyramid in terms of complexity, homo sapiens needs to find ways to use this increasing complexity to its own advantage. I assume that a more reflective, less ad hoc intrusion midway, will be forthcoming to \\"demonstrate,\\" if Wright can, that one-world government is a solution to some of our predicaments. The same evidence actually seems to support the opposite conclusion.

This book is more or less in the first category. This is a page-turning type of mystery, that gets more repulsive (story, that is) as it progresses towards its climactic, repugnant, and bizarre ending. As mystery plots go, this is one of the best.<br /><br />But Wilson's authorial qualities are a bit on the formulaic side; everytime the set changes, we get a modicum of a description almost as afterthoughts to let us know what the environment or the person looks like. They are at most perfunctory, sometimes unnecessary, and always formulaic interpolations that bog the novel down. If Wilson had a figurative flair, this might not be so bothersome, but Wilson's description of people, places, and things are almost always an afterthought interposed to make the person, place, or thing more than two-dimensional; but they're never really helpful. The story is pretty much linear, and the characters are individuals we could care less if we ever were to meet.<br /><br />Despite the oftentimes platitidunious writing, this novel is one of the best contrived mysteries I've read, and certainly one of the most bizarre. Even if the characters are nothing more than hastily-described placecards and too abstruse to really care about after 200 pages, the interesting plot keeps the reader thoroughly engaged. So the deficiencies in writing and character development are more than ofset by the controverted (and controversial), economical, yet wholly credible plot.<br /><br />Despite these serious flaws, recommended.	2005-05-20

Because of this \\"hard wiring\\" as one commentator observes, the strict methodology of science has just recently began to branch out of its \\"models\\" of uniformity and embraced diversity. Meanwhile, the diversity of human creativity, especially as it applies to the arts, has avoided at all costs any semblance of having a \\"model\\" by which to judge the universal appeals of so much diversity. It's time that the creative arts started taking a look for \\"models\\" into serious view as it evaluates themselves. I think this is a reasonable and defensible thesis against solipsism.<br /><br />The argument is not an either/or dysjunction, but an and/both conjunction. Science has discovered a number of theories which serve to explain the universe as we know it. It strives to find the common ground on which to evaluate the world as we have come to know it. Conversely, the creative arts and the humanities have avoided, to the extreme, any effort for artists to \\"conform\\" to similar models found in nature and described by science. Barrow thinks it is time to reverse this odd peculiarity.<br /><br />After all, when we evaluate painting or music, for example, we see that certain patterns emerge which give each endeavor a backbone for acceptance or rejection. The archetonics of harmonic cords and pictoral perspectivism require that certain creative arts fulfill these a priori demands, otherwise we regard such works as \\"distorted\\" or even worse \\"contorted.\\" This result is not arbitrary, but developed over years of knowing that representational art must be \\"three dimensional,\\" not two, and that in music a chord is composed of certain harmonic notes that please the natural disposition of the ear both aesthetically and physiologically.<br /><br />Barrow illustrates these patterns of proportionality, perspectivism, chordal harmonies, etc., in light that they shed on the acceptability or rejection of certain \\"given\\" patterns innate in life. His thesis that the creative arts ought at least entertain the association of these innate given patterns in their evaluation as \\"works of art,\\" just as science has decreed that the universe itself operates on the principles of certain immutable laws. I found his argument persausive, as one who is endeared more towards the artistic endeavors more than to the scientific ones. Thus, not all that passes itself off a \\"art\\" ought to be evaluated on the basis of its diversity, but also on the basis of its conformity to certain aesthetic criteria that are found in nature itself. Thus, many of those artistic endeavors that are meant to shock the observer by their discordance and lack of proportionality are incongruent with certain immutable aesthetic judgments based on nature's inherent designs. Ergo, the creative arts may have a certain degree of freedom to create outside the boundaries of our natural dispositions, but for the most part they must play within certain rules enough of the time in order to constitute pleasing versus unpleasant art. How much of a jump there is between \\"good\\" versus \\"bad\\" art from these immutable rules is at least partially determined by objective criteria. The question becomes, How much?<br /><br />As one who is a \\"conservative\\" aesthete, I find Barrow's argument more than persuasive. I'm not sure just how conformable a work of art must be to the innate rules of nature before it passes from acceptable to unacceptable. But now that I know there are indeed such naturally innate rules, I am much better able to evaluate, as well as articulate, the creative arts on a more expansive, yet nonetheless \\"natural\\" criteria. Barrow's book is an engaging and worthwhile polemic.yet nonetheless \\"natural\\" criteria. Barrow's book is an engaging and worthwhile polemic.	2005-05-17

From geology, to astronomy, to evolution, to chemistry, to biochemistry, to anthropology, to gentics, to ecology, and points in between, Bryson covers a lot of territory without bogging the narrative down with the arcane and obscure. Clarity, not obfuscation, is his aim, and he masterfully achieves it. Not that some postulations are not without problems, it's just that he's able to illustrate the problems of certain scientific ideas and their concomitant problems in a most lucid, intelligent, and mostly rigorous manner. Occasionally he adds zest to his enterprise by use of puns, humor, and wit, sometimes bordering on the flippant, but he carefully confines his comic observations within the larger scope of precision. He combines both the history (read: Development) and the current postulations in such a way that neither one or the other intrudes, but exemplifies the points he's making. The true gem of this book is keeping the scientific perspective anthropomorphic; after all, it is only humans who can observe and remark on the masterworks of the universe and publish their observations and theories from an entirely humanistic reserve. Another gem is his ability to make scientific data not only interesting, but relevant to issues confronting this species known as homo sapiens, without resorting to polemic or the soapbox. Making science relevant and useful to the average layman is quite a task, and he does it with aplomb and without banter. The only presumptions Bryson makes is that the reader is at least familiar with junior high school scientific notions.<br /><br />This book is a highly entertaining, informative, and useful overview of the world of science since the 17th century. Where controversy still exists, he's careful to draw out the nuances, without becoming bogged down in every detail. For the reader looking for a pleasant examination of all things scientific at the beginning of the 21st century, I cannot imagine a better, more thoughtful, and balanced book to cover such vast matters within a reasonably easy-to-understand scope. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that sometimes his personal story supplants his over-arching theme, which can be read either as personally engaging or slightly annoying, depending on one's disposition to such things. Except for this possible flaw, the book is very highly recommended.leasant examination of all things scientific at the beginning of the 21st century, I cannot imagine a better, more thoughtful, and balanced book to cover such vast matters within a reasonably easy-to-understand scope.

You'll be pleasantly, elegantly, coherently, and intelligibly guided through the breakthrough in chemical and physical science. And you'll also become more aware of this century's greatest scientific challenge: How to unify two contrary, maybe even contradictory, theories about how the world works -- quantum theory and relativity theory. The former works well on the microscopic level, while the later works well on the macroscopic level, but the two are at odds when \\"combined.\\" How could this be?<br /><br />There's no real answer -- not yet, but not for lack of engaging effort. You'll encounter everything from quarks to quasars to black holes and dead stars (are they the same?) to relativity to the anthropic principle, the three paradigms of time -- from Copernicus to Penrose and from Newton to Einstein. Intensely condensed and easily digestible, \\"A Brief History of Time\\" is a remarkable achievement and a joy to read. It's a review of all \\"must-know\\" physics and chemistry that will update the literate person of today in very accessible, easy-to-read, yet dense writing.<br /><br />The remarkable thing about this tour d'force is that, after all the efforts from Sir Francis Bacon to today to expunge metaphysics from the scientific blackboard, metaphysics have reintered through the mathematics' back door. One has to ask one's self whether or not invisible strings are keeping with \\"scientific\\" explanations for things that go bump in the night? Is it really science to \\"posit\\" theories based wholly on unseen, mathematically-derivative possibility? Has science crossed its own threshold?<br /><br />However the reader decides a question like this, one is ably armed to discuss it head on after reading this fine book. I am by no means a \\"scientific\\" person, but this wonderful overview offers enough armamentaria to think about the physical sciences intelligently. For that, and for Hawking's incredible clarity, this book is worthy of it continued long-term success.ical sciences intelligently.

I had read his \\"Flight of Aquavit,\\" hardly memorable, but nonetheless enjoyable. Thinking his earlier novel,  \\"Amuse Bouche,\\" would be equally entertaining, I dove in.<br /><br />The dedication page is the book's highlight. It's all downhill from there. While an engaging author, if not a bit too flippant, he knows how to direct a scene -- maybe excessively. Here we have only three basic scenes, three abrupt diversions, and a lot of conversational clutter. The little mystery that there is, is whether Bidulka tried to write three different novels, or decided to combine three incomplete thoughts into one. The narrative, while clear and attractive, often comes to abrupt end, only to restart again in another vein. It doesn't take a mindreader to figure out who will be dead (well before the five chapters later) and who will be the culprit (if you have any intuition at all).<br /><br />While the writing is engaging, the story is not. If you like to read campy phatic communication for its own sake, you'll tolerate this novel's other disappointments, but if you know of invited guests that overstay their welcome -- and simply refuse to call it a night, then you'll know the feeling one has by novel's end.

The novel is taut, dynamic, playful, sarcastic, sardonic, and well-written. The editing is the only thing to mar this otherwise stellar mystery, and an abrupt conclusion to the case could have been slightly prolonged to enhance its overall enjoyment. But don't let these quibbles deny you the pleasure of reading one of the best sleuthing fictions, gay or straight, in print. It's quickly read in an afternoon, and one can relish in the delight that it reads quickly -- almost too quickly, but things and momentum develop concomitantly on every page.

The authors approach the subject of human altruism and the biological advantages of multilevel (group) selection vis-a-vis human egoism, hedonism, anti-functionalism, and individual functionalism from an interdisciplinary, but primarily evolutionary, approach.<br /><br />The first half of the book deals with biology, genetics, and anthropology that provide the empirical grounds and logical inferences for believing that multi-level functionalism (groups and stratification) as opposed to individual-only and anti-functionalism evolved through natural selection by rewarding the fittest group selection, social norms, group adaptation, and cultural evolution, just as it rewards the fittest individual. Ergo, just as natural selection favors the fittest individuals, so it favors those individuals who cooperate in the traits of the fittest groups that survive over many generations.<br /><br />The second section of the book takes the multi-level functionalism and altruism of the first half and evaluates arguments for and against it from psychological, motivational, and philosophical perspectives. While largely armchair speculation (due to lack of empirical studies confined to products of evolution rather than the actual process of evolution), the authors conclude again that natural selection again favors the fittest group, multi-level functionalism, and altruism over egoism, hedonism, selfishness, and individual selection only.<br /><br />The authors' evidence and arguments are elegant, persuasive, and rigorous, but as the authors admit, much of the arguments are speculative, as no large scale studies have been done to prove or disprove their theses, because the whole subject had been largely abandoned for decades. Still, the cogent and coherent arguments make a convincing case for the rehabilitation of group-altruistic natural selection that is every bit as effectual as individual-selfish natural selection, just as Darwin presciently observed in the \\"Descent of Man.\\" The conclusion is that mankind is naturally disposed by evolution to work altruistically in groups and that certain groups adapt to their environment better than others increases the significance of natural selection of the group as well as the individual. What the authors prove is that we can no longer ignore group dynamics in the evolutionary process. Altruism benefits both the individual and the group in natural selection.

Degler's book is a historical account of - not a philosophical, sociological, or psychological argument for - the rise and fall of \\"social Darwinism.\\"<br /><br />He begins with an important historical demarcation at the beginning of the 19th century between Spencerism (Herbert Spencer), Lamarckism (Jean Baptiste Lamarck), and Darwinism (Charles Darwin). What we call \\"social Darwinism\\" today is not derived from Darwin himself (although one might infer it from his \\"Descent of Man\\"), but is actually Spencerism. Spencer, not Darwin, is the one that asserted man is entirely biologically determined. In the nature/nurture dichotomy after the appearance of \\"Descent of Man,\\" nature is the sole determinate of human nature.<br /><br />Degler then proceeds for about 200 pages to describe the various reactions against all three of the above forms of evolution as it applies to human beings, starting with the provocative and virulent challenges from anthropology, particularly by Franz Boaz, then onto sociology, and finally onto psychology. All three of these social sciences denied that evolution in any of the above forms contributed to the makeup of homo sapiens. In what becomes a highly repetitive and often tedious account, Degler excavates a minefield of writers from all the social sciences at the end of the 19th century to the mid-20th century to attack all aspects of biologically acquired or inherited characteristics in mankind invoked by evolution. Almost all of these attacks start from the \\"liberal\\" conclusion first, viz., that man is the product of his environment only, and then proceed to provide \\"empirical\\" evidence and premises for the conclusion that supports intelligence, sexism, racism, feeblemindedness, and the like are all the consequence of society, culture, and the environment, not the result of any biological, much less evolutionary, determinate.  Even the notion of \\"instinct\\" is practically annihilated. By 1950, the infamous B. F. Skinner had announced that all human behavior was nothing more than a conditioned response to external stimuli - and nothing more. Thus, during this period of the nature/nurture dispute, despite the variety of approaches in the social sciences, nurture alone was deemed the sole determinate of human nature.<br /><br />By the end of part two, Degler covers more than fifty years of cultural relativism in the social sciences in manifold detail. By the 1950s, attitudes slowly began to change with two concurrent events: (1) The revitalization of genetics and ethology in the field of psychology, and (2) the publication of three major books: Nikolaus Tinbergen's \\"Study of Instinct\\" (1951), Konrad Lorenz's \\"On Aggression\\" (1966), and E. O. Wilson's \\"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis\\" (1975). Instinct was resurrected, and the social sciences could no longer ignore the biological encroachment of genetics and instinct on every living species, including man..The incest taboo is but one example that exists both among non-human and human animals. Aggression is another. The flight/fright response is yet another. Dominance/submissiveness, reproductive success, kin inclusiveness, survival of the fittest, etc., are all based on the Darwinian principles of evolution that have shown themselves \\"predictive\\" and \\"probable\\" (as opposed to absolute and necessary) inherited characteristics. Such characteristics are mere probabilities, based on genetic inheritances over hundreds, if not thousands and millions, of years. How they actually interact with each individual in the human species is, of course, a matter of adaptation of the species to the environment; hence, there is not the Spencerian inevitability that \\"social Darwinists\\" speak of.<br /><br />This book is a treasure trove of historical developments (or lack thereof) of Darwinism in the fields of biology, genetics, anthropology, psychology, and sociology, especially as it pertains to the first-half of the 20th century. It also clears up several ambiguities and misplaced attributions. Overall, though, it can be tedious and repetitive by restating the same principles from myriads of different social scientists. But it is a heuristic device that leads to the triumph of sociobiology as an essential tool in all the sciences, both natural and social. For all of its historical antecedents, it does lack a contemporary balance in how sociobiology is infiltrating our understanding of human nature today. Therefore, be prepared to continue reading a book like E. O.

There are no \\"innate\\" ideas, nor logically a priori knowledge, only sense impressions that arise out of direct experience of the five senses and concomitant sense ideas that arise in the imagination. The imagination (i.e., mind) then makes associations. From these various sense impressions and ideas, the imagination commingles the ideas with inferences from resemblance, contiguity, and causality. Examples: The imagination relates one sense impression and its concomitant sense idea with another when they share similar characteristics or resemble one another, such as in shape, height, weight, distance, proportion, color, etc. The imagination associates one sense impression and its concomitant sense idea with another when they are in close contiguity, such as proximity in time, place, situation, connection, succession, etc. Lastly, the imagination associates one sense impression and its concomitant sense idea with another when there appears to be some cause and effect, for example when one turns on a wall switch, and a light appears, or one turns a key in an ignition, and a car starts, or other causal inferences. Only from the sense ideas and impressions, commingled with the imagination's inferences of resemblance, contiguity, and causality, can any opinion or belief or knowledge be known. The difference between an opinion, belief, or knowledge is only one of degree, namely, how strong, convincingly, and lively (Hume uses the word \\"vivacity\\") the senses, their ideas, and the inferences work themselves out in the imagination. Generally, knowledge is reserved only for the strongest of degrees of inference, such as those verifiable and not refutable by inferential (cf., deductive) logic or experimentation; all else is either opinion or belief. But no knowledge, no matter how often repeated and examined inductively, is absolute; all knowledge, like opinion and belief, is contingent. For \\"absolute\\" knowledge once held the earth to be flat, to be the center of the universe, and non-rotating. Even Einstein's Theory of Relativity had to be revised by a Special Theory of Relativity. We still don't understand how the universe can be \\"full\\" and still \\"expanding,\\" yet both are true (so far!). Only knowledge, belief, and opinion derived from the senses, their ideas, and imaginative inferences have merit; all other \\"imaginations,\\" such as the deductive existence of a \\"God\\" or Supreme Being, absolute morals, or correct emotions, are merely speculative imaginations, and ultimately all such speculation leads to nothing more than myth or superstition, false dogmas, and irrational beliefs.<br /><br />The passions, better known as either sensations or emotions, are derived from sense experience as well and are derived from the other sense impressions and sense ideas. Sensations are those experiences that arise within the imagination itself, based on something the body itself produces, such as hunger, pain, thirst, pleasure, and uneasiness. Emotions are those experiences that arise from the sensations and sense impressions and their concomitant sense ideas. The four principle emotions are: (1) Pride, and its opposite (2) Humility; (3) Love, and its opposite (4) Hatred. Pride and Love are desirable, whereas Humility and Hatred are undesirable. All other emotions are derived from, or are in one degree or another, always reducible to these four. Beauty, for example, is the love of something well-figured and loved for its own sake, while ugliness is something disfigured or ill-figured and hated. Anger is a form of hatred, while happiness is a form of either Pride or Love or both. Jealousy is a form of hatred (of another), while compassion is a form of Love. All emotions, when considered in their origins, have these four emotions as their foundation; it's all a matter of degree and kind.<br /><br />There is no absolute morality; no moral principle can be deductively arrived at (except to be pure speculation). Morals can only be inferred from the two principles of (1) maximize pleasure and (2) avoid pain. These principles are natural inclinations of the body itself, not derived from logic or reason (i.e., speculation), but by verifiable experimentation, inferred from experience itself, especially the emotions of pride, humility, love, and hatred. We like to be loved, we despise to be hated, so we do those things that maximize these natural inclinations, because we want pleasure and to avoid pain, and they alone are what count as \\"moral.\\" All virtue is that which brings us pleasure; all vice is that which brings us pain. For example, we are just to one another, not because we ought to be, but because we desire that being just toward others will merit other's affection, whereas being unjust will cause others to avoid us; the first is pleasurable, the latter is painful. We respect each other's property because it brings us mutual pleasure to enjoy the fruits of our own labor, whereas it causes us pain to have our property taken from us. The origin of government is from the experience where doing things socially imparts pleasure, whereas doing things in isolation causes pain. No one is an island, is true. Warding off an enemy as an individual forces the individual to bear all the weight, thus causing pain. Fighting the enemy together fosters our mutual interests (i.e., pleasure), and allows all to participate in the fruits of individual endeavors. We benefit from mutual cooperation, which good government ought to foster, whereas we lose and experience pain when we try to fight all battles by our own selves. There really is benefit in \\"numbers,\\" to having more people in favor of the things we collectively sponsor and work hard for, and are opposed to those things that oppress. Showing how \\"each person benefits by collective effort\\" is how to operate good government; showing \\"how each person loses by individual effort alone\\" is another good reason for government.

As delightful as the movie is, the book is even better, because we are able to get into the thoughts of the characters and the mind-set near the turn of the 20th century. At first, I did not like Forster's writing style; it's almost too economical, occasionally cryptic. Many times the prepositional referent isn't altogether clear, creating unnecessary ambiguity. Moreover, a lot of the jargon is particular to second-decade England, not to current U.S readers. But as the story picks up momentum, the economy of style turns almost poetic, and the linguistic particularities fade, making this novel into a real page-turner.<br /><br />The story and the characters are highly realistic, even by today's standards (though written in 1914). There's the common issue of the conflict with \\"coming-out\\" gay vis-a-vis the desire to be \\"normal,\\" which as Forster concludes, is essentially one and the same, regardless of nature's impulses. While to be gay is ultimately to be normal, it is not without its social and personal prejudices and misunderstandings, particularly at the time this book was written. Likewise, Forster demonstrates that gay people can (and most often do) lead quite normal, happy, even transforming lives, despite these difficulties. This is what gives the novel its joy.<br /><br />Above all, this is a typical story of the vicissitudes of love, the only difference being that it involves three men (and several secondary women). One man (Clive), while thoroughly enjoying his same-sex love, ultimately represses it to make himself socially acceptable, politically viable, and personally miserable. Another man (Maurice), initially thinks he has to do likewise, but he cannot suppress the insuppressible, and finally does the inevitable and heeds his nature's call. The third man (Alec) discovers his unique love, and while initially angry that his love isn't immediately reciprocated, comes to love the man who really does love him after all. In many ways, this is the ultimate \\"homosexual\\" novel, but in many other ways, it is also the universal romantic novel.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious love story, Forster weaves in various themes and ideas of the times (that are still with us). For the perspicuity in incorporating these themes and how they relate to being a human being first, and being gay second, Forster makes for a most satisfying reflection and examination of perennial issues. Not only is the single most important emotion, love, addressed in all its complexities, but so are certain theological, psychological, philosophical, business, and political nuances addressed. The whole enterprise is exceptionally satisfying. A novel worth anyone's time.love him after all.

His major and last contribution is his \\"Enquiry,\\" which was written late in his life; the other is Part III of his \\"Treatise on Human Nature,\\" which was written much earlier in life. The two treatments are very different, and of the two, I much prefer the latter, as it is \\"demonstrated\\" a posteriori that man has a \\"natural inclincation\\" to maximize pleasure and to avoid pain. Besed on this natural inclination, humans endeavor to do those things that produce happiness, pride, joy, etc., because it maximizes pleasure, whereas humans endeavor to avoid those things that produce uneasiness, disturbances, misery, etc., because those things produce pain. From this a posteriori of natural inclinations, Hume explores the reasons why some things count as virtures (because they maximize pleasure), while some things count as vices (because they produce pain).<br /><br />His \\"Enquiry,\\" however, takes an altogether different approach, one based on the sentiments of utility and beneficence. Here humans do things that maximize their usefulness to themselves and to society that concomitantly bring beneficence. Those sentiments that are distinguished in natural language such as dexterity, perserverance, chastity, endurance, honesty, etc., count as virtues because they are \\"useful,\\" while those that produce in natural language such things as sloth, lethargy, dishonesty, misery, etc., count as vice because they are \\"not useful.\\" Our language itself is the measure of their untility.<br /><br />The two theories, juxtaposed, are not at odds with each other, but definitely have distinctively different aetiologies. What I prefer about the \\"Treatise\\" is that one can infer the logical necessity of \\"natural inclinations\\" (dare I say \\"instinct\\") to maximize pleasure and avoid pain. This seems indisputably true empirically. Morals are indeed an a posteriori part of the human constitution. All the virtues and vices derived from this single principle have a solid foundation in human nature itself. Conversely, to merely posit that virtues and vices are merely sentiments according to their \\"utility\\" is less grounded in the person's natural inclinations, and is something one observes about human behavior in general.<br /><br />Which approach will the reader prefer? That's difficult to determine, which is a good reason to read both the \\"Treatise\\" and the \\"Enquiry.\\" As I already mentioned, they are not at odds with each other, they just have different starting points. Personally, the approach in the \\"Treatise\\" appeals because it starts with a intrinsic feature of what it is to be human, i.e., it seems to have a stronger foundation and logically inferred consequences from observances. Yet, the approach in the \\"Enquiry\\" is more vivacious, but is less grounded, because it is merely posits observances of ephemeral conditions that continually change from time to time and from culture to culture. If one wants to affirm that morals do have a solid foundation in human nature, you'll probably prefer the \\"Treatise,\\" but if one wants to affirm that morals are merely \\"preferences\\" built into our natural language that differ from culture to culture and from time to time, you'll probably prefer the \\"Enquiry.\\" Either way, however, they take us away from pie-in-the-sky metaphysical speculations!undation in human nature itself.

Newman is without doubt the most elegant, eloquent, and persuasive argument yet for the belief in God by any Christian philosopher. Despite its 19th-century origins, it remains one of the most modern of Christian philosophies yet. Gone are all references to Aristotle and Aquinas and their antediluvian methodologies of a priori logic to \\"prove\\" the existence of God and why it is supposedly \\"rational\\" to believe in such a God.<br /><br />In its stead, Newman uses the Humean methodology of a posteriori inferences that lead one to believe that the \\"uneasiness\\" one feels (another Humean concept) about certain disturbances of the mind/soul that are attributable to the indwelling, or natural inclination, of the \\"conscience.\\" From this natural inclination (again Hume) and by rational inference (Hume again), Newman posits step by step, and from different angles, that it is only a natural logical inference to assent to the belief in God. But it is the a posteriori experience of \\"conscience,\\" not some a priori \\"proof,\\" that leads the way.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the rigorous prelude of the first-two chapters; they give considerable detail to the methodology Newman intends to use, which again is empirically oriented, not a priori logically deduced. The reading after that is a breeze, containing absolute wonderment at the level of perspicuity, rhetorical advantage, and logical nuances that infer God's existence from natural inclinations. It was, and remains, a revolutionary approach, and is a worthy work to include in any Christian's library.	2005-03-18

And that's the point; Rand is an armchair speculative, grounding the support of her arguments from an Aristotlean, a priori-type logic that can \\"prove\\" just about anything. The greatest Aristotlean of them all, Thomas Aquinas, could prove or disprove just about anything and everything from the same logical method, and come up with all sorts of differing conclusions. Aquinas wrote his \\"Summa Theologica\\" using nothing but deductive logic, and upon close scrutiny, one ultimately has to ask: Is this really a reasonable (cf, rational) enterprise after all?<br /><br />Using deductive logic, which Rand extols, can be helpful, but rarely leads to any \\"facts.\\" It's merely speculation, and after a while, one has to ask if this whole methodology has any merit to it at all. Those committed to \\"strong reasons\\" will always speculate why their dogmas are superior to another's. But after a while, one begins to see that such a priori speculations are just that: An over-reliance on deductive logic to create a preference for one myth over another. The problem is that they are all myths, or false dogmas, or irrational conclusions based on spurious premises (even though the conclusions may be \\"valid,\\" they aren't \\"sound\\").<br /><br />For those tired of reading endless rational speculations based on nothing more than armchair a priori deductions, and becoming confused rather than enlightened about human affairs, a good antedote to all these mythologizers is reading 18th-century empiricist philosopher David Hume's \\"Treatise on Human Nature.\\" First, he proves that there are no a apriori foundations for genuine knowledge (opinion or belief).  All knowledge is a posteriori, that is inferred inductively from sense experience and the imagination's inferential patterns of resemblance, contiguity, and causality. Second, he shows that sensations and emotions are empirical, not a priori, and that they contribute just as much to our \\"knowledge\\" as does verification and non-falsibility. Lastly, he demonstrates that morals and the knowledge of them are based not on some pie-in-the-sky theory, but on the basic human inclination (shall we dare say \\"instinct\\") to maximize pleasure and avoid pain. For those who are tired of endless speculative metaphysical and highly rational (in the sense of overly a priori premises and conclusions) dogmas and myths, Hume is a great antedote.<br /><br />Since Rand is no different from her progenitors Aristotle and Aquinas, whether you \\"choose\\" to buy into her armchair epistemology will depend on whether or not you've had enough of overly-deductive reason, outdated metaphysics, and irrational dogmas and myths. If you think she has the \\"answers,\\" try out Hume's antedote to see that she might be just another in a long list of mythologizers.our \\"knowledge\\" as does verification and non-falsibility.

Rand is ever the hyper-rationalist, believing that all problems can be solved by using humankind's unique endowment of \\"reason.\\" After all, didn't Boethius claim mankind is the superior species, because \\"man is a rational animal?\\" Rand certainly agrees with Boethius' apotheosis of reason.<br /><br />But, what KIND of reason? There are at least TWO types of reason: (1) hyper-reason based on a priori, deductive, syllogistic logic, and (2) ordinary reason, based on a posteriori, experiential, inferential logic. (There is a third kind of reason, called mathematical propositional calculus, that is a blend of the two, while heavily favoring the latter.)<br /><br />Rand is certainly in the first camp, and that's her problem. Almost anything can be deduced syllogistically as Aristotle and Aquinas amply demonstrate. Pick up either author's tomes on how the world \\"is,\\" and you'll quickly find out they were consistently wrong. They both started from one or more false premises, that lead to false conclusions. More importantly, people, no matter how \\"rational\\" they may appear, do not used deductive, a priori logic as consistently as Rand would suggest, much less like. It's not in our nature. The very few that do are \\"hyper-rationalists,\\" and they are more annoying than satisfying.<br /><br />Most people, if they use logic at all, use the SECOND kind, and this is the kind that is based on experience, on inferences drawn from direct experience with the senses. It is the development of this kind of reason that has led to the most ambitious outcomes in the history of mankind. But this reason admits up front that nothing is certain, all knowledge and morals are contingent, and that there are no eternal truths. This is the logic Rand deplores. Not because it isn't the most appropriate, but because everything is contingent -- there are no \\"objective\\" or \\"absolute\\" conclusions. Rand cannot assert her dogmas under this kind of logic. Only \\"hyper-rationality\\" of the FIRST kind will allow her to do that!<br /><br />Most philosophers and scientists have minimized or abandoned the first kind of logic for all the myths, false dogmas, and irrational conclusions that ensue from it. Read Aristotle or Aquinas to see just how wrong they are on practically everything, yet these are the two best paradigms of the first kind of reason. Rand is one of the last holdouts for this kind of irrational logic. That is why the \\"objectivist\\" project is doomed from the start; it merely changes the \\"old\\" dogmas for \\"new\\" ones, \\"old\\" myths for \\"new\\" ones. That is why here project is doomed from the start, and why reading her \\"new\\" claptrap is no better than reading the \\"old\\" ones.

Let me state from the outset that I believe capitalism is the best of all economic systems, but that doesn't mean I close my eyes to its deficiencies, of which there are plenty. Rand merely totes the capitalist party line without any critical eye to some of its inherent problems. Even master-capitalists Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek are not blinded by their fondness for capitalism the way that Rand is. Capitalism, and its concomitant minimal governmental intrusion, are to be commended, but in the way that critically evaluates both its virtues and vices, and Worldcom is just the most recent case of its vices. At least Ludwig von Mises and Friederich von Hayek recognize its vices, and, while acknowledging them, still demonstrate why capitalism is the superior system -- giving copious reasons and examples of why this is true. They also detail the vices of its antagonist, socialism, in a way that seems to elude Rand. Read these other important writers for a thorough examination of capitalism, not Rand's dogmatist's appeal based on hyper-rationality.	2005-03-15

Some are obviously no longer in print, while others merely duplicate existing material. This compendium of Ellis' thought is perhaps the most exhaustive, one-volume set available, and for that reason alone, this book is to be recommended above all others. It contains all the essentials to a guide to well-being using REBT.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts: Part I is about Sex, Love, and Marriage and deals with such diverse subjects as vaginal vs. clitoral orgasm, sex fascism and censorship, intercourse in all its flavors, unhealthy love and its causes and treatments, sex-love: its adventure and contribution to personality growth, the nature of disturbed marital interation (e.g., jealousy, extramarital affairs, distrust, etc.), and why Dr. Ellis became interested in such issues. Many of these essays are over 50-years old, and yet are every bit as vibrant and informative today as when first written. Some issues may at first cause consternation, such as the advocacy of adolescent masturbation and premarital sex, while other essays contain a sort of \\"eureka!\\" value at how we are our own most destructive individuals in our most committed relationships. Those who thought the Sixties brought sexual liberation will be impressed with just how advanced Ellis' thought was a decade or two earlier. His liberating attitudes towards sexuality in general, and \\"mishaps\\" in particular, are well worth the book alone.<br /><br />Part II concerns REBT in practice: The theory behind rational psychotherapy, the value of being human, techniques for disputing irrational beliefs and the human ego, the use of REBT imagery, achieving self-actualization, and how to use REBT to cope with disability. For those unfamiliar with the A-B-Cs of REBT, Ellis takes the reader on a step-by-step analysis of the process of coping with irrational behavior. \\"A\\" stands for actuating event, \\"B\\" stands for rational and irrational beliefs, and \\"C\\" stands for consequences. In life, we encounter actuating events that emote either (a) a rational or (b) an irrational belief, which then develop their consequence. Ellis gives examples of such events, both rational and irrational beliefs, and the consequence when one belief rather than other is chosen. The idea, of course, is to choose rational over irrational beliefs (the single most important locus of why we can or can't handle certain situations) to produce the healthiest consequence. This is the Core of REBT.<br /><br />Part III concerns rational living in an irrational society. I don't know of any of the other 55-or-so books that deal with this subject so explicitly. Topics include Labor-Management relations, the \\"Objectivist\\" view of self-esteem, a case against religiosity, application of REBT to an emotional education, REBT as a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy, addictive behaviors and personality disorders, and how to incorporate REBT in one's psychotherapeutic practice. Included in these topics are the conformity or non-conformity and the indivduality of the individual, self-awareness, acceptance of ambiguity and uncertainty, tolerance of self and others, acceptance of humans and their \\"animality,\\" commitments and intrinsic enjoyment, creativity and originality, social interest and ethical trust, self-direction, flexibility and the scientific outlook, unconditional self-acceptance, risk-taking and experimentation, the joys of hedonism, and work and practice. This is only a partial list of the topics covered. But each topic alone, not to mention the collation of all of them together, go the great distance in helping one's self adapt to, and be adept at, life's vicissitues. Many of the externals we cannot change, or can only change minimally, but how we react to them can wholly be changed, and that is what REBT claims to do best.<br /><br />Most chapters build on preceding chapters, so the temptation to read \\"ahead\\" is discouraged.

At our first lecture, Briggs excoriated Adele Davis, the Sixties' food guru, and his former student. Ever since, I've viewed \\"counter theories\\" with a more suspicious eye. This book is a perfect example of why.<br /><br />Ms. Appleton is a Ph.D., but no scientist.  What are her qualifications to debunk the proven germ-theory of disease? None. She's merely speculating about something nonscientific armchair Ph.D.s have no expertise in. If you really want a scientific account of \\"Why We Get Sick,\\" read a book by that name by authors Randolph Nesse and George Williams (M.D. and Ph.D. respectively). They not only prove the germ theory of disease, but give evolutionary reasons for it. Don't buy this nonsense that doesn't even reach the level of \\"junk science,\\" because there is no science here. This book is quackery, plain and simple.<br /><br />Certainly, not all illnesses are because of, nor exacerbated by, food intolerances. Such panacea descriptions have been debunked over and over, and still people crave to blame disease and disorders on \\"food intolerances,\\" and food \\"allergies,\\" and other such nonsense. Indeed, I think she'd be hard-pressed to find any such association between food and disease, much less any disease, except for metabolic disorders. Before long, she'll ascribe even HIV and cancer as the result of food intolerance!<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; good nutrition and healthy diets do promote healthy outcomes, but so do microorganisms produce illnesses and disorders far more than mere any food will. Conversely, we know that people who exercise daily and eat four healthy meals a day come down with a plethora of disorders and diseases that have nothing whatsoever to do with food.<br /><br />We do know that diets high in fat, salt, and sugar are not healthy, but this doesn't excuse the \\"leap\\" to \\"food intolerances\\" as the cause of things like lymphadentiis,viseral abscesses, septic shock, staphyloccocus, streptococcus, pneumeococcus, Anthrax, Cholera, Meliodosis, Tuberculosis, systemic Fungal, Rickettsial, Chlamydial, Viral, and Parasitic infections, much less immunological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic and bilary, endoctrine, hematological, musculoskeletal, muscular, neurological, psychiatric, genitourinary, and dermatological disorders, to name a few.<br /><br />This book is total and unadulterated nonsense that is just another gimmick in the world of conspiracies. Yes, we really do want to believe that disease is all because of the food we eat, because that's something we think we can control. To a limited extent, the maxim, \\"you are what you eat\\" is apropro. But to make outlandish claims that have no biological, chemical, or physical bases in fact is spurious from the get go. Don't waste your precious money on these panhandlers.

Prior to 1995, I don't know of any book addressed to the layperson that explicated these matters as well as he did with the information he had at his disposal. That said, I had many problems with Goleman's exposition. First, it is not altogether certain nor important, as he insists, that the brain's amygdala is the locus of all emotions, a highly disputatious claim. Secondly, he never quite comes to define what an emotion is other than a \\"feeling,\\" which is hardly revelatory or insightful. Are they cognitive judgments of value, or are they something the amygdala emotes separate and distinct from ratiocination, or are they the passions separate from ratiocination (which seems to be the case)? By comparison, Martha Nussbaum in \\"Upheavals of Thought\\" is far more explicative of what an emotion is, how it develops, and each emotion functions - both healthily and destructively.<br /><br />He does, however, explain a variety of emotions function and how they help a person either function or dysfunction in both their personal and social domains, and for this alone, the book is helpful. His project is (1) to make the reader self-aware of his emotions; (2) help the reader understand what it means to be engulfed by them; (3) accepting of emotions, especially those that reward the self and others. This strategy is part of his \\"know thyself\\"and is fundamental to his project of developing emotional intelligence. He also makes the reader aware that too much attention has been spent on ratiocinative development at the expense of emotional development; whereas they ought to go hand in hand. He cites a number of very good and helpful examples.<br /><br />Subjects covered (but by no means exhaustive) include impulse control, the cost of misattunement, passionate versus indifference, empathy, represssion, and other emotional factors that either facilitate or debilitate the individual in leading healthy lives. In many instances, he shows the reader why one emotions can be destructive, while another instance on how \\"reprogramming\\" the mind can make the emotions beneficial rather than destructive. Given that other books on the market are either more exhaustive and/or more directly helpful, I can't recommend this book other than for its perusal value.

Self-Control Through the Power of Reason	Books	5	37	41	N	Y	Excellent REBT Therapy for Neurosis and Depression	The field of psychology is in disarray. What began in the late nineteenth-century as an exploration into the dynamics of the mind (i.e., psyche) and human behavior has been torn asunder by the variant \\"schools\\" of psycho-dynamics. After years of psychoanalysis, more people found \\"relief\\" in Wayne Dyer's \\"Your Erogenous Zones\\" than benefitted from twenty years of Freudian or Jungian psychoanalysis. With the advent of TCAs and SSRIs, even more people found relief in a little pill than in two centuries of talk therapy. What we know or don't know about psychiatry and psychology is more baffling now than ever will. For whatever it is worth, the human psyche is more evasive than tangible, and I'm not sure more damage than good has been done under its various mentors.<br /><br />I have come to believe that three aspects of human behavior are unquestionable: (1) What we learned as children plays a more significant role in human dynamics than we'll ever know; (2) no matter what era one lives in, there's always a degree of alienation, anger, and angst; and (3) that certain chemical imbalances in the brain play an important, if not vital, role in how we adapt to life in general, and to change in particular. Treatment of neurosis and affective disorders usually requires that we adapt better than we have, and \\"traditional\\" psychoanalysis has been found seriously wanting. That having been said, I want to evaluate two books outside that domain and within the domain of \\"self help\\" that appear to be of enormous benefit. They are: (i) Albert Ellis' and Robert Harper's \\"A Guide to Rational Living, and (ii) Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\"<br /><br />Both books are in the domain of Cognitive, or Rational-Emotive, Behavioral Therapy. The more I've studied the historical, intellectual, and hermeneutic influences from the Hellenistic Period, the more I am convinced that the cognitive \\"therapy of desire\\" and the cognitive \\"treatment of upheavals of thought\\" play a significant role in how we adapt to our daily lives than anything approaching Freud or Jung will ever do. Simply by changing our attitudes, reactions, and plights against our most basic emotions, the more we are adept at, and adapt to, leading more successful, healthy, and balanced lives. Both \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" and \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" are in this latter venue. Both books are invaluable in teaching the reader how to overcome obstacles in one's life in a way that is both realistic and therapeutic.<br /><br />The first misconception to get over is that the passions (i.e., emotions) are somehow separate and distinct from our ratiocinative faculties of the mind. Both cognitive and evolutionary psychology have demonstrated, without argument, that the two function occur within the same mental framework (cf., Daniel Goleman's \\"Emotional Intelligence,\\" which locates all emotions in the amygdala). The second misconception to overcome is that emotions, qua emotions, are generally unhealthy, e.g., the Stoics. Take one example: The fright/flight response is an evolutionary response to fear that all of us animals, including human ones, have for self-preservation. This emotion, like many others, are key to our survival. As Martha Nussbaum argues cogently, even love and compassion are survival-oriented emotions (see her \\"Upheavals of Thought.\\").<br /><br />Most debilitating emotions arise because we have not taught ourselves how to think/emote rationally. Both books argue and attempt to treat this. The difference between the two is that \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" is less adept at how to change our rational control over our emotions, while \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" explicates the process in considerable detail. Either book is better than nothing, but clearly the later gives explicit directions on how to overcome irrational thinking. Aristotle (yes, him) distinguished between theoretical and practical reasoning over two millennia ago, and his assessment has not been devalued over time. In practical reasoning - the reasoning that determines how we act either ethically or emotionally, one begins with a universal premise, then supplying a particular premise, and then coming up with a conclusion or action. For example: \\"Do good, avoid evil\\" is a universal premise; than add the particular premise: \\"If I am good to John, he'll be good to me.\\" In this case the universal premise is probably correct, but the particular premise is fallacious. Just because I love John does not mean he'll love me. When John fails to be good to you, the usual response is something like, \\"he hates me,\\" \\"because he hates me, I am no good,\\" \\"you idiot, I did my best, and you didn't reciprocate,\\" etc. Sometimes, it's because of a faulty universal premise: \\"If I'm good, others should be good.\\"In either case, both universal and particular premises are irrational. First, no one is wholly good, and secondly, even if one believes himself good, doesn't mean someone else is.<br /><br />Both books illustrate the fallacies of such arguments. And, once one sees the fallacy of this kind of argument, the more one feels anger, frustration, and depression dissipate. I personally think, \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" brings out these fallacies more clearly, but both books touch on the same irrational beliefs that lead to the same irrational emotions. Whether it is the universal premise or the particular premise, or both, that cause our fallacies and lead us into emotional grief, it is, after all, our faulty thinking that leads us to disappointment, anger, frustration, depression, etc.. Learning how to detect and correct such premises is what both books are about. \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" tends to be more attractive to those who are more \\"rational\\" about their thinking process, whereas \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" tends to more attractive to those who are more emotive. Both books will get you to the desired end. And either book will \\"get you there\\" for less than one-fifth the price of a single psychoanalysis. And, for those seriously depressed, another book worth considering is \\"Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,\\" which also uses CBT to alleviate much distress. I wasn't impressed with it as I was the other two. But whatever you do, invest in at least one of these books; unhealthy emotions and depression are not necessary, as each shows.r time.

Nussbaum's focus, however, is not all the philosophical concepts touched upon during this enormous stretch of time, but with human flourishing (i.e., eudaimonia) and the important ethical insights of this period. Using the medical paradigm that the philosophers themselves used, she approaches Aristotle, the Epicureans, the Skeptics, and finally the Stoics conception of the good life well lived. Each of these philosophical schools attempted to \\"treat\\" the disorders of the mind (i.e., psyche), particularly the emotions and how they divert the soul from health to disease.<br /><br />She begins with Plato's and Aristotle's belief that the emotions are a \\"part\\" of the soul, separate and distinct from the ratiocinative part. Plato thought all emotions needed to be controlled by reason (the charioteer and the two steeds), while Aristotle thought the emotions, distinct from the appetites and reason, need to find the golden mean through the process of using the intellect to control the passions from excess or deficiency. The Epicureans, on the other hand, make no such distinction, arguing instead that all emotions are flawed if they don't have the right premises (usually the \\"universal\\" premise) of practical thinking. Change the universal premise, usually by rote memory of rules of inference, and the emotions are tamed. The Skeptics took the approach that all passionate and deliberative thought was premised on false premises; citing Sextus Empiricus and his extreme Pyrrhonism, she illustrates how their resistance to all forms of dogmatism, e.g., certainty about the truth in any form, was a ruse. (I think Nussbaum could have explored the Skeptics more thoroughly than she does.) The Skeptics insisted that no two people perceive the same thing in the same way; even emotional responses were entirely unique and based upon the \\"belief\\" that something was true, when in fact, no belief is true. Their approach was simply to \\"suspend\\" all judgments altogether, thereby not being committed to one way of thinking or another.<br /><br />The Stoics, on the other hand, alight onto something Nussbaum finds both intriguing and true. The emotions are not a separate faculty of the soul, but the same faculty involved in ratiocination. Emotions are nothing more than \\"internal\\" cognitive reactions to external stimuli. Treatment of the soul, for the Stoics, was apathy (i.e., ataraxia): Don't let the soul (i.e., mind) become \\"disturbed\\" by external factors. By simply extirpating emotive reactions, the Stoic \\"therapy\\" involves the complete the annihilation of the emotions altogether. External (cf., internal) conditions are simply a matter of fate or whim, neither within nor without one's control. Why get exercised over them? It only begets anger, frustration, and depression. Only our internal reaction to them are controllable. The only way to deal with our reactions is to ignore or repress them, or else they will take control over the self -- and almost always for the worse. Anger, fear, frustration, anxiety, love,pity,compassion,grandiosity, our finitude, etc., do not come form the outside; they are emotions that cognitively react to outside events beyond the self's control. But what good do they serve? None. They only make one react to things that are outside the agent's control. The tonic: Overcome them through extirpation, and thus lead a calm, dispassionate, and equipoised life.<br /><br />Nussbaum's erudite, sophisticated, and elegant evaluation of these schools of thought ought to engender the person of the twenty-first century into \\"current\\" modalities for the treatment of mental disorders. In the \\"Therapy of Desire\\" she lays the intellectual and historical foundations of current cognitive modalities. (This she explores in greater detail into her sequel\\"Upheavals of Thought.\\") But, by confining ourselves to this rich intellectual, hermeneutic, and \\"medical\\" history of the Hellenistic period, we can already anticipate the use of both Epicurean and Stoic thought in Cognitive Behavior and Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapies, and how successful both paradigms have become. (For example, see Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" and Albert Ellis' \\"A Guide to Rational Living.\\") Nussbaum not only weaves a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive understanding of Hellenistic thought, she provides the ancient, and yet contemporary, underpinnings of modern cognitive psychology. Her book is rich in quotes from both periods, and is an excellent introduction into why the ancient Greek/Roman philosophers still speak to us today.sequel \\"Upheavals of Thought.\\") But, by confining ourselves to this rich intellectual, hermeneutic, and \\"medical\\" history of the Hellenistic period, we can already anticipate the use of both Epicurean and Stoic thought in Cognitive Behavior and Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapies, and how successful both paradigms have become.

First, the fact that the novel involves a thirteen year old discovering his gay tendencies for the first time, while obviously overt, do not limit this novel to the gay interests only. What is craftily recorded in a plurality of ways involves all the typical emotions, reactions, distances, frustrations and alienation that a typical adolescent experiences, and is, I suspect, universally experienced, whether one is gay or straight. Second, Soehnlein is adept at conveying both healthy and unhealthy emotional responses by parents, family, friends, antagonists, and fantasies that carry themselves well into adulthood. Exposing these emotions for what they are, whether good and bad, is often helpful to one coming to terms with those emotions that often stigmatize one's life well beyond adolescence. Nearly the whole spectrum of emotions is raised at one point or another, allowing the reader not only empathy, but also compassion, for the predicaments that all of the characters find themselves situated. Third, Soehnlein craftily weaves into the novel a variety of human dynamics that are true of the world that all of us, to some extent or another, find ourselves in. \\"The World of Normal Boys\\" successfully depicts the vagaries of experience and the varieties of people we encounter, whether as a child, a friend, a parent, or beloved. Displaying these types of individuals and their capacity to help and harm us makes the novel insightful and provocative - making not only for interesting reading, but self-examination at the same time. Finally, I could not determine who this book is designed for, as it seems to be too sophisticated for a pre-adolescent audience, but not especially literate for an adult audience. It's kind of in between - a sort of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type of novel. Certainly, an adult who has a troubled youth could find this novel especially insightful. Also, older adolescents may find much to relate to as they process their experiences toward adulthood. Finally, because of its overt gay themes, those individuals who have had difficulty coming out, coming to terms, and coming of age with their special sexuality will find solidarity with the main character. Being different at an earlier age often stigmatizes one for the rest of his life; this novel demonstrates that being unique or different actually adds color and zest to the pluralism of life.

Both books are invaluable in teaching the reader how to overcome obstacles in one's life in a way that is both realistic and therapeutic.<br /><br />The first misconception to get over is that the passions (i.e., emotions) are somehow separate and distinct from our ratiocinative faculties of the mind. Both cognitive and evolutionary psychology have demonstrated, without argument, that the two function occur within the same mental framework (cf., Daniel Goleman's \\"Emotional Intelligence,\\" which locates all emotions in the amygdala). The second misconception to overcome is that emotions, qua emotions, are generally unhealthy, e.g., the Stoics. Take one example: The fright/flight response is an evolutionary response to fear that all of us animals, including human ones, have for self-preservation. This emotion, like many others, are key to our survival. As Martha Nussbaum argues cogently, even love and compassion are survival-oriented emotions (see her \\"Upheavals of Thought.\\").<br /><br />Most debilitating emotions arise because we have not taught ourselves how to think/emote rationally. Both books argue and attempt to treat this. The difference between the two is that \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" is less adept at how to change our rational control over our emotions, while \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" explicates the process in considerable detail. Either book is better than nothing, but clearly the later gives explicit directions on how to overcome irrational thinking. Aristotle (yes, him) distinguished between theoretical and practical reasoning over two millennia ago, and his assessment has not been devalued over time. In practical reasoning - the reasoning that determines how we act either ethically or emotionally, one begins with a universal premise, then supplying a particular premise, and then coming up with a conclusion or action. For example: \\"Do good, avoid evil\\" is a universal premise; than add the particular premise: \\"If I am good to John, he'll be good to me.\\" In this case the universal premise is probably correct, but the particular premise is fallacious. Just because I love John does not mean he'll love me. When John fails to be good to you, the usual response is something like, \\"he hates me,\\" \\"because he hates me, I am no good,\\" \\"you idiot, I did my best, and you didn't reciprocate,\\" etc. Sometimes, it's because of a faulty universal premise: \\"If I'm good, others should be good.\\"In either case, both universal and particular premises are irrational. First, no one is wholly good, and secondly, even if one believes himself good, doesn't mean someone else is.<br /><br />Both books illustrate the fallacies of such arguments. And, once one sees the fallacy of this kind of argument, the more one feels anger, frustration, and depression dissipate. I personally think, \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" brings out these fallacies more clearly, but both books touch on the same irrational beliefs that lead to the same irrational emotions. Whether it is the universal premise or the particular premise, or both, that cause our fallacies and lead us into emotional grief, it is, after all, our faulty thinking that leads us to disappointment, anger, frustration, depression, etc.. Learning how to detect and correct such premises is what both books are about. \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" tends to be more attractive to those who are more \\"rational\\" about their thinking process, whereas \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" tends to more attractive to those who are more emotive. Both books will get you to the desired end. And either book will \\"get you there\\" for less than one-fifth the price of a single psychoanalysis. And, for those seriously depressed, another book worth considering is \\"Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,\\" which also uses CBT to alleviate much distress. I wasn't impressed with it as I was the other two. But whatever you do, invest in at least one of these books; unhealthy emotions and depression are not necessary, as each shows.valued over time.

Approaching them primarily from a philosophical perspective, particularly a neo-Stoic view, of what the emotions are, how they function cognitively, and what problems they cause and purposes they serve, Nussbaum incorporates animal behavioralism, evolutionary psychology, philosophical paradoxes, and the humanities' expression of the emotions to (1) evaluate how they both serve and disserve the individual, and (2) how which emotions are appropriate for the person to function well in society.<br /><br />She begins with the Stoic's account of the emotions, how emotions are cognitive judgment of value and neither appetitive nor a separate function of the passions (sui generis), and challenges the Stoic raison d'etre to extirpate all of them from life. She believes the Stoic view is too severe, which she became cognizant of during the death of, and the grief over, her mother. The Stoic extirpation (i.e., apathy) of the emotions may satisfy one's personal life in some limited sense, but at the expense of perverting one's personal commitments and one's social and civic life. She then proceeds to show how one's individual development, starting from infancy and advancing through adulthood, serve and disserve the individual personally and socially, arguing that emotions are appropriate to given situations in life. Her principal concern is to not extirpate the emotions, but how one ought to develop them as intrinsically given, especially the emotions of love and compassion, so that they contribute to human flourishing (i.e., eudaimonia) in a very dynamic way. Love, properly ordered, is one such emotion (cognitive judgment of value) that involves our most intimate and personal commitments and projects, while compassion (also a cognitive judgment of value) is another essential emotion to the order of our political, economic, and social commitments and projects.<br /><br />Then, in a most interdisciplinary fashion, she takes the historical development of the emotions through their hermeneutic history. Using the arts, philosophy, theology, music, economics, and literature, she explores the historical development and refinement of emotions, particularly of love and compassion, as expressed and developed in such figures as Plato, Spinoza, Augustine, Dante, Adam Smith, Mahler, Bronte, Proust, and Joyce among others. Each figure contributes either positively or negatively to our ultimate understanding of how the emotions figure into our cognitive judgment of values for human flourishing in both our personal and civic lives.<br /><br />This book is a rich, invigorating, multifaceted, and very satisfying exploration into a very critical aspect of the human behavior, particularly the emotions of love and compassion, in order to harness these judgments of value for our ultimate happiness (again, eduaimonia). The book's 700 pages are by no means exhaustive, which she frequently restates, nor tightly as argued as it could be. The problem, and there is one, is that the book flows much more like a lecture (which it originally was), and less like highly-disciplined argument. The argument is unquestionably made, it is simply not as concise, precise, nor as rigorous as I would have liked. There are too many extraneous diversions that distract us from her central arguments. A good editor and clearer and more ostensive articulation of her arguments would certainly be welcome in a revised edition.erdisciplinary fashion, she takes the historical development of the emotions through their hermeneutic history.

This book is a real toud d'force, covering literature, philosophy, history, and artefacts throughout the ages. Crompton is at complete odds with Boswell's two tomes on homosexuality, clearly laying the blame for most homophobia on the doorsteps of Christianity. Not until Augustine of Hippo, Clement of Alexandria, and John Chrysostom does homosexuality become a perversion that is meeted with some harsh, even lethal, opposition -- all because of the Story of Sodom and Gommorah, which ironically has nothing to do with homosexuality, but which the early Church Fathers decided was the lynchpin of God's wrath toward the unrighteous homosexual -- indeed, not just the homosexual, but any society that countenanced it. The Catholic Inquisition was matched only by the Protestant Reformation in its zeal to liquidate any form of same-sex love by a misreading of the Sodom story, and by a single verse from Leviticus -- a Code which most Christians reject or ignore categorically, yet from a single verse comes some of the most perverse reprisals against the gay community.<br /><br />Crompton's book is more like a textbook of all things homosexual prior to the 20th century than it is a thesis about a particular worldview of homosexuality. Homosexuals in almost all societies have enjoyed some of the most insightful and keen minds, beginning with ancient Greece and persisting throughout the modern era. But for all the accomplishments of gay men and women, the gay person has always been at the forefront of progroms to purge society of God's ire. Gays have always been blamed for anything that has gone wrong in almost every society -- except in ancient Greece, where same sex love facilitated military heroism. Retracing same-sex love from the \\"Iliad\\" through Plutarch, one sees a tolerant attitude convert to antipathy in the writings of the Christian Church Fathers -- almost always citing Leviticus 20:13, and starting with the adoption of the Christian faith as the national religion of medieval Rome in A.D. 390.<br /><br />There have been many an outstanding book on the topic of homosexuality, including John Boswell's two tomes, Dover's \\"Greek Homosexuality,\\" and David Greenberg's \\"The Construction of Homosexuality.\\" But none of these other works compares in eloqution, spectrum, or detail of Crompton's excellent survey. This is a book for every gay person's and historican's library; an exellent reference point for many of the people who have borne reproach for same-sex affinity; and a world view largely of Christianity's hostility. For all its wealth of information and eloquence, this book is highly recommended.me sex love facilitated military heroism.

Hunt weaves a good story, one that is relaxed and attenuated by a meandering plot, one that ultimately satisfies only superficially. One can read the notes from above for information about the plot if they are interested, and it is a good story as far as a story can go. But it isn't much of a \\"mystery\\" -- even in the end. There's no point in guessing who the culprit is, because there isn't enough information on which to base any speculation.

And, for being written in the first-person, it is convincingly told. It's about gay life (or a gay person) in the gay mecca of New Orleans. He's a go-go dancer who becomes an unwilling sleuth and catalyst to uncover a plot to destroy Sin City. He has visions through which the Goddess tells him advance events (really!). And so, a story that starts with the dancer and a trick ends up involving the FBI, the Religious Reich, pot head parents, a friend's killing, and a house burning.<br />The story is often redundant, with the litany \\"tight ass, smooth legs, and muscularly toned chest\\" added twice a page or so for good measure. Those expecting a steamy sex scene will be sorely disappointed. The plot is exceedingly thin, and the bulk of it is told in fewer than twenty pages.

Suddenly, as the trial progresses, another Doll Case-like murder is uncovered, but the Doll Case suspect is supposedly already dead. How can the murderer be dead if the cases continue to arise?<br />The novel is heavily laced with court proceedings about the widow's revenge, Harry's love affair with the widow of the man he kills in \\"The Black Echo,\\" and Harry's conviction that the Hollywood police have a copycat murderer (instead of not having caught the right guy the first time).<br />These two subplots, and primary plot, should have made this one of the better novels, and according to the reviews, most readers liked the latticed effect. I thought it too divisionary. The subplots are necessary, but could have been severely cut to keep the main story in focus.

The plot is very well constructed, with revelations evenly paced throughout. The characters are more than placecards to hold their positions for the novel to unfold.

Parts VI, VII, and VIII (about 100-200 pages, depending on edition) especially could be radically reduced with a finer sheen. The story sort of drags to bring in some characters that have only incidental merit to the overall plot.<br />As a Californian, I knew many of the acronyms and numerical titles for PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), 405 (San Diego Freeway), 10 (Santa Monica Freeway), but Connelly uses these shorthand equivalents in a way that might make the distant reader feel confused. He's given to using these initials in the text (such as O.M. for Old Man), that's rather offputting.<br />Overall recommended.	2004-06-15

It was a real struggle to overcome this obstacle, as one really wants this book to be a page turner, but the style prevents it.<br />This is my first, but by no means my last, Bosch-series novel.

Successful new genes alter the epigegentic rules of populations. The alter epigenetic rules change the direction and effectiveness of the channels of cultural acquisition.\\"<br />The social sciences should study genetic populations not individuals, because universal behavior is that which is most persistent and relevant to human behavior. Individual variants, while interesting in themselves, must be variants of universal human behavior in order to be fully understood and known in their relative context. Our knowledge, therefore, is limited to universals, not specifics.<br />The imaginative arts starts with the real world genetics, claims Wilson, and builds upon it with coherent metaphors that give art and science their vibrance. The creative impulse is the flip side of science that must build itself up with archetypes, themes, and symbols that inspire relaxation and reinforce science's advancements.<br />Religion is a hold over from centuries of man's evolution, in that, in the wild pre-man had to worry about being killed as well as killing other species. This holdover of genetic dominance and subordination finds its expression in the fear of some mythical beast, in this case of god. Our evolutionary hardwire leads individuals to substitute the myth that some supernatural being exists, even though the logical and positivistic basis for such a dominant being are now rationally debunked.<br />The book is articulate, provocative, and covers a wide spectrum of ideas, but I didn't find all the arguments particularly persuasive. I thought the argument on the arts more of a meditation on archetypes than an argument of universal knowledge through genetics. The social sciences too was seemingly lame; knowledge as that limited to universals is a throw back to Aristotle. and seems to limit the daunting variety of humankind. The most successful was the religion and ethics; one can easily be ethical without a supreme being handing out punishment and rewards, and belief in god gets people nowhere but false comfort.

In this analysis, Newman contributes his own understanding to the debate and decides Luther not only got it wrong, he got it wrong on all points.<br />One of his excellent tactics is to take the evangelical view on its own basis, the Bible alone, and he demonstrates from the psalmists, prophets, apostles, and evangelists that the &quot;justification&quot;  and &quot;righteousness&quot; are used interchangeably throughout salvation history. The bottom line is that we are all called to righteousness , and our justification is a Pauline spin on how we achieve this righteousness. Not by faith alone, as most Protestants claim, but by our total obedience to the Law made manifest in the Gospel and epistles, which means by the works of our faith.<br />To simplify Newman's elegant and eloquent argument, being justified is being righteous, and being righteous is being in  a state of grace that is imprinted in our very being -- not imputed onto us, as Luther advocates . God has given us the faith necessary to believe and the grace to act upon it. The more we abide in obedience to God's will for us, the more our justification (righteousness) becomes our sanctification (blessedness).  Newman obviously takes the catholic view of salvation, wherein the one who is saved is justified, the one justified is made righteous, the one made righteous is sanctified, and the one sanctified enteres into blessedness.<br />This book is for all students studying the question of the Justification by Faith, especially by faith &quot;alone.&quot; Newman is a seminal thinker who has been highly influential in raising the issue within the Latin Church, and did much to help reconcile the differences between Lutheran and Catholic doctrine.

It is tremendously suspenseful and carefully crafted. This is must reading for those who have lost faith with fiction.<br /><br />There are several errors, though: A double noun gets a singular verb, Sunday School is erroneously imputed to Roman Catholics, misunderstanding of the immaculate conception for the virgin birth, the difference between the resurrection of Jesus and his ascension, and a helicopter that races up without our knowing what happened to it -- minor annoyances considering the otherwise painful attention to detail.<br /><br />Readers looking for prosaic style of a James, Nabokov, McCarthy, etc., will not find it here. The syntax is simple and the semantics should be discernable to anyone with a ninth grade education. While the writing is not erudite, the subject matter often is. When the novel stumbles on a subject that the general reader might not know, Brown provides a definition. The story is flawed by being uneven; much too much detail is spent on the minutae of clues, and little effort goes into the furtherance of the plot. After spending 400 pages of chasing one clue after another, it would have been nice to have more detail spent on plot development.

I understand that this book was meant to be less intimidating to the novice and intermdiate investor alike, and he doesn't disappoint with accessible articulation and a witty style that should appeal to every reader.<br />The two chapters on asset allocation, the ~one~ thing the investor is able to control, and the one thing which directly rewards the investor, doesn't explain the \\"frontiers\\" and why four assets or ten is best for the individual investor. The efficient frontier in layman's terms would have been especially helpful. On the other hand, dauntless pages were dedicated to diminishing returns (DR), which  were clearly adumbrated for their importance.<br />Then Bernstein concentrates on Vanguard investment opportunities, with only brief reference to ETFs (exchange traded funds). Vanguard is to be commended for bringing index-investing to the fore, but Vanguard's steep minimums and stiff penalties are impediments for the smaller investor and are downright subversive to the investor who does not believe in a \\"buy-and-hold\\" theory of investing. Many ETFs are more asset specific and can be had without excess cost through a discount broker. I wish Bernstein had discussed the merits and demerits of \\"buy-and-hold\\" as opposed to, say the Fabian and other methods of entering and exiting the market on certain MDAs (moving daily averages).<br />I found Bernstein's lack of mention of mid cap stocks throughout the book puzzling. None of the hypothetical asset allocations in the book have any room for mid caps, which can enhance performance and reduce risk. For Bernstein, there are only large and small market capitalization - no middle capitalization. Also, foreign funds and ETFs of foreign assets (such as EFA for MSCI-EAFE index) are considered important, but get only passing and ambiguous comments. The graphs and tables are helpful for the most part, but many are out of date, and some lacked a marked differentiation in plotting more than one overlap, which made for challenging deciphering.<br />The writing is effusive and accessible, making it a good introductory book and a refresher for bulls and bears alike. Overall, I found the book to be a tad bit too garrulous, but easy to read and informative . My cavils and criticisms aside, this book is truly one of the best books on investment in print.red important, but get only passing and ambiguous comments.

Why do we consider ourselves lucky if voters think they are participating in a democracy when 40% of all incumbents don't even have a challenger? In campaigns where two candidates offer a choice, only 20% of the extreme sides are really enthused about the two choices, while the 60% in between hold their noses and vote for the lesser of two they dislike. Then, in the winner takes all system, any candidate who wins by 50.1% wins the entire election, disenfranchising the 49.9% who voted for the candidate who didn't win. Whether the loser was close or a distant second, all who voted for her lose everything. Is this really a democracy if only a majority are represented, but the minority (more often a close second) are left empty handed? Is it any wonder that fewer and fewer people believe they have a choice or that their vote really counts? Third parties, which rarely capture more than 20%, become \\"spoilers,\\" not viable choices in our winner take all system. Ross Periot and Ralph Nader, candidates of recent memory who got less than twenty percent, caused the preferred candidate to lose to the worst of two evils, because voting for them was a \\"wasted\\" on a candidate who could not win. Doesn't this system seem absurd?<br />According to Amy and other political theorists, our archaic and arcane system is altogether the wrong way to go about elections. Instead of winner take all (and minority lose all), Amy and others are advocates of proportional representation. Briefly, this system allocates a slate of candidates who only win what they actually win; if they win 51.0% then they only get 60% of the seats available, and the other party gets 40% of the seats available. If third parties run candidates and amass 20% of the vote, they then get 20% of the seats available. In other words, every vote counts and everyone is represented. When government goes about its business, each candidate or party proportionately represents the vote it got in the prior election. Every vote counts, and even those candidates who lose by a hair still have substantial representation in the chambers of the legislative bodies. This system is not novel. Indeed it is the preferred system in Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, with only the U.S. and Great Britain being holdouts for the archaic winner takes all vote.<br />Amy's scholarly, but easy-to-read, book is a goldmine and blue print of an alternative systems where every vote counts. Indeed, there are cities in the United States that already use proportional voting as the means of electing their candidates. And, Amy spends the better part of his book explaining the different means of achieving political enfranchisement used here and abroad through proportional representation. I cannot think of a more important book on the topic of electoral reform, what it entails, and what it provides in a critical, and indeed, essential manner. If I vote for a distant third party that only garners 10% of the vote, at least I'll know that my vote wasn't wasted and that I'll have one person who actually represents me in our democratic republic. Mutatis mutandis, if I vote for a candidate who only gets 42% of the vote, I won't be disenfranchised, but will have 40% representation. And likewise, if a candidate wins by more than 50%, I can take comfort that the majority will get the highest number of representatives without leaving the \\"losers\\" getting nothing. I strongly urge this urgent book upon all who are discontent with our winner take all system. It's coherent and concise presentation makes the reading easy, and its content makes its subject matter desperately needed.rds, every vote counts and everyone is represented.

This is an extraordinarily well-written and energetic tome of small frame but great stature. Scruton, the Enblish conservative that he is, explains why conservatism is not a theory to be applied but a doctrine to be worked out. The dogmatics of conservatism, a phrase he uses, is that all of us are by nature social beings before we are individuals; indeed, our own individualsim is discovered only in confrontation with the &quot;other&quot;. This social animal, known as man, has accured many rites, rituals, ceremonies, institutions, and habits that indoctrinate him before he even gets going. Of course, humans are free to modify and change these institutions, but it is alway thus -- modification and change of existent institutions, ceremonies, and the like. The conservative wants to preserve those rites, ceremonies, and institutions that have been tested by time, not for the sake of preservation, but for the sake of their timeless success.<br />With the Sixties, all these assumptions were turned on their head; everything was challenged, and much that was good and noble was like the proverbial baby thrown out with the bath water. For conservatives, it is sufficient to demonstrate that these instutions, tradtions, and histories worked; the fact that they worked is dogmatic, not theoretical or possible, but true and sure. Naturally, some of the assumptions and instutitions at the time of the Sixties were in need of reform, but for the most part, these reforms have begotten us worst institutions than preceded them.<br />Some of the subjects of which Scruton addresses are authority and allegiance, constitution and state, law and liberty, property, alienated labor, autonomous institutions, and the Establishment. He addresses all the familiar gripes by the Far Left in an intelligent and able manner. By the book's end, I couldn't tell whether Scruton was a &quot;conservative&quot; or what these days goes by &quot;communitarian.&quot; In many ways, the notions overlap, and those wanting a thorough-going understanding of either &quot;concept&quot; will enjoy reading this short, but fulsome, book.e wanting a thorough-going understanding of either &quot;concept&quot; will enjoy reading this short, but fulsome, book.	2003-06-03

The demise of the USSR, the retrenchment from state ownership in Great Britain, Sweden, and elsewhere, and the failure of socialism to establish fair value and actual prices all lead most of these authors to this inevitable and obvious conclusion.<br />Suppose: Instead of a grand program of State ownership of production, why don't we try individual ownershp through cooperatives, employee-owned corporations, and the like? Ever heard of United and Transworld Airlines? Both followed this model right into bankruptcy. How about Ben and Jerry's ice cream; perhaps the model has to be super-small inorder for the the concept to work?<br />These are the primary and reasonable arguments made repeatedly in this well-writen, but no longer timely, book. The problems with socialism are so gargantuan that no socialistic scheme will ever work. One only has to read Hayek's prescient &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot; to see all the reasons why this is so unfold. Besides, &quot;market socialism,&quot; as one author admits, is a contradiction, or an oxymoron if you wish, which is being forced into some scheme because the larger and older scheme didn't, and in fact cannot, work.<br />I admire the authors' attempts to fight the many problems with capitalism, such as worker alienation, slave wages, job insecurity, and the like. But the answer to these time-tested problems don't seem to be any form of socialism that this book unsuccessfully addresses.<br />That said, don't stop trying, but the schemes outlined in this book, many of which have been tried and failed since its publication, are passe.	2003-06-02

Its focus is largely virtue ethics, but embraces a wide wraith of different ethical systems to satisfy the broadest of tastes. The authors take \\"vrtue\\" in its widest senses and comments on them from various traditions, especially Aristotle, Kant, and Mill who occupy center stage. The book also includes chapters on the virtues of Hume, moral psychology, communitarian, emotivist, and feminist perspectives, along with other modern issues. It is a commentary (rather than a didactic) on a broad spectrum ethical theories, their strengths and weaknesses, and develops and enhances some of the nuances that have not received wide audiences. Among its contributors are Roger Crisp (also editor), John Cuttingham, Brad Hooker, Terence Irwin, Michael Slote, Gabriele Taylor, and David Wiggins.<br />Books like this are very pleasing to read, inasmuch as it does not war with each others' opinion and comments, but revises and extends the original sources in ways that are relevant to the contemporary reader. Although a presumption of basic ethical theories will reduce readership, those familiar with these theories will find these essays tremendously interesting and informative. I came away from the book not believing in any single ethical theory, but developing an appreciation for the virtue of almost all of them (utilitarianism will always be hard for me to swallow when applied individually), divergent as they may be. There seems to be a place at both the table of discussion and at the table of our lives for a pluralistic use of ethical theories, ancient and modern.<br />The writing is exceptionally clear and concise, rarely bordering on the obtuse or exceptionally abstract. Any person interested in ethics will prize this book in his/her collection.	2003-05-08

This book is a compilation of Aristotlean and Christian metaphysics that extols the power of the triune powers of spirit, soul, and body. Sound familiar? If you've studied Aristotle and/or Plotinus, you'll find much that is familiar, whilst incorporating Christian revelation. If you need a metaphysic to order your own life in some spiritual manner, this book will probably be of immense benefit to you.<br />Since the days of Wittgenstein, philosophy has moved away from this kind of metaphysics. Rather than construct elaborate (or simple) gothic edifaces by which to understand the world in which we live, Wittgenstein and others have done their level best to deconstruct metaphysics as presented here. After one becomes accustomed to life without superstructures in which to pigeonhole life events and experiences, books like this seem like a throwback to ancient times when &quot;how many angels dance on the head of a needle&quot; are important.<br />For those who need such labyrinthine superstructures, this book is about as good as it gets. It provides a superstructure by which to understand the world and one's place in it. I found myself often attracted to such ideas, only to be reminded that such structures are merely artifaces that serve to answer life's big questions with theory rather than hard core science.<br />For example, Jesus' resurrection wasn't a true resurrection, but a dissembling of his body on this &quot;plane of existence&quot; to another &quot;plane of existence.&quot; But where is this &quot;other&quot; plane of existence, how many of them are there, and why does Jesus get there and the rest don't, why did the disciples see it for a time, and then not? Another example is the claim that God wants us to be happy and healthy and not suffer in this life, yet the God of the Christian Bible is a Suffering God (remember the Cross?). Isaiah speaks of God's &quot;suffering servant.&quot; This quandry is never resolved.<br />The book incorporates Eastern as well as Western (including Emersonian) thought in a way that makes them synergistic. This feat makes the book worth reading, even if one doesn't like metaphysics. Wittgenstein is famous for having said he preferred the &quot;world as he found it.&quot; If one has adopted this motto for his worldview, this book breaks all those rules. After 45 years of trying to make religion fit my experience, and then trying to make experience fit my religion, I decided to adopt Wittgenstein's motto -- and consequently, find books like this just another attempt to reconcile the irreconcileable.esolved.<br />The book incorporates Eastern as well as Western (including Emersonian) thought in a way that makes them synergistic.

The ideal book would include propositional as well as predicate calculus. This book does both. The other features of this marvelous little book are equally satisfying. The self tutorial is done heuristically, so that each step builds upon the last.

O. Wilson is progenitor).<br />The book is deftly, wittily, and elegantly written with great confidence and assuredness. The first half of the book introduces the reader to the promising field of evolutionary psychology, which, for the first time, promises to ground psychology on science rather than ideology. The book rings the death knell to Freud, Jung, pop-psychology, and other pie-in-the-sky notions that have mascaraded as a \\"human science.\\"<br />The second half of the book addresses four of the most focal concerns of human nature: Aggression, sex, altruism, and religion, on the basis of sociobiology theory. The emergence of this endeavor begins with genes, evolution, and human enculturation, not with theories about infantilism, phallocentrism, and neuroticism. The topics are sufficiently covered in enough detail to keep the reader's interest and sustain the arguments, but with the intent of being introductory and accessible rather than sallying into the esoteric and academic.<br />The consequence is a wholly different orientation toward what is meant by \\"human nature.\\" The concept is no longer the stuff of speculative metaphysics by armchair philosophers and psychologists, but a true science evolving out of the science of evolutionary theory and genetics. The implications are not quasi-scientific, but truly scientific. Humans do indeed have a \\"nature,\\" and it is based on nature, not in the imaginations of wishful thinkers.<br />No one, not already exposed to sociobiology, will finish reading this book unaffected for the better. Wilson, the author of \\"Sociobiology,\\" \\"Consilience,\\" \\"The Future of Life,\\" and other enjoyable works, will find a plethora of other authors and books flooding the market with scientific insights into man's true \\"human nature,\\" including \\"The Adaptive Mind,\\" \\"The Moral Animal,\\" \\"Non-Zero,\\" and \\"Unto Others.\\"d,\\" \\"The Moral Animal,\\" \\"Non-Zero,\\" and \\"Unto Others.\\"	2002-06-11

Each chapter is about five pages, two columns each, of dense thought expressed throughout the ages -- from Plato through James, from Homer through Tolstoy, from Copernicus through Einstein -- highlighting the best that ever has been imagined or thought.<br />The author synthesizes the great and important ideas arising over the eras, taking no sides, but expositing the different and divergent ideas these great thinkers committed to writing for posterity's benefit. It's like reading the whole library of the Great Books of Western Civilization in a thematic, rather than, serialized, manner.<br />I've grown accustomed to reading a chapter a day, and then rereading these chapters as ideas pop up in other contexts. In these chapters I find such disparate sages as Jane Austin, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Aquinas, Descartes, Aristotle, Darwin, and everyone else who has something to contribute. This tome is truly encyclopeadic and catholic in scope and reference.<br />If I had the time and the means, I would read these original sources for myself and develop a card catalogue of the massive resources for the mere pleasure of knowledge for its own sake. But as time doesn't permit such a rigorous endeavor, I find Adler's synthesis to be the next best thing.<br />This book will be a great resource for the whole family, especially adults and adolescents just beginning their studies. It will be of great value to those of college-level, where many students are bereft of these great ideas, cast aside for more &quot;politically correct&quot; authors and ideas. This book is a suitable bromide against the myopia of modernity and its tendencies toward nihilism. Above all, it is the best that has ever been thought or said.hat has ever been thought or said.	2002-06-11

It begins with clarification of the kind of Darwinism the authors appeal to, so that everyone is on the same page, and considers the general psychological foundations of Darwinism on culture.<br />The book then moves on to discuss cognitive adaptations for social exchange, citing human and non-human examples. The book also includes the evolutionary psychology of mating and sex, examining preferences for mate selection and competition, mechanisms for sexual attraction, and the evolutionary use of women as chattel (something any Old Testament and Quran reader can relate to).<br />A significant portion of the book is devoted to parental care and children, examining how pregnancy sickness, patterns between twins, maternal-infant vocalizations, and child play in the form of chasing each other are all evolutionary mechanisms that continue to be featured.<br />Steven Pinker adds an essay on natural language and natural selection; Roger Shepard contributes an essay on the man's perceptual adaptation to the natural world; both of which demonstrate the interconnectedness between perception, language, and adaptation.<br />The book concludes with some of its most esoteric issues: environmental aesthetics, intrapsychic processes, and the theoretical implications of culural phenomena.<br />The whole book, while not necessarily over-academic, is ultimately dense reading. Most of the concepts and conceptualizations require mental work to apprehend, while the statistics and empirical evidence are clearly described. While drawing from many disparate areas of evolutionary biology, all the essays find their ultimate significance in how the mind, in particular, has adapted to environmental forces. A demanding, but facinating, read.	2002-06-10

I've used the two-part reading and prayerful meditation assigned for each day with the Liturgy of the Hours to great avail. Even though some of the reflections and meditations no longer correspond to the scriptural readings assigned by Lectionary after Vatican II (this applies only to Sunday lections), the reflections are wholly self-contained and no less relevant.

It covers all aspects of theism vs. atheism from every angle known (and some not very well known). It's divided into three major parts: Part I deals with reason versus all the other systems of belief and opinion, showing that man's better part is to stick with reason, in particular epistemological belief and metaphysical realities (after all, even theologians admit man is a rational animal); Part II deals with reason versus faith, where faith is used by theists as a raison d'etre for being deliberately irrational. Here one finds all the arguments theists use to privilege faith over reason, and Smith's rebuttal to each one of them is simple as it is direct. Here, the argument wanders a little far afield unnecessarily into extreme skepticism, but given that skepticism is often a theist's most powerful tool to make special pleadings for theism, such a venture may be useful to some readers. The sections on in this section on arguments from Authority, Voluntarism, and Revelation are especially incisive. Part III deals with all the usual philosophical arguments for the existence of god (ontological and cosmological), and why each argument ultimately fails. This is the least interesting section, because it is the most overwrought topic of the book, focusing clearly and adroitly on theism so-called proofs of god's existence (too many have rehearsed this material elsewhere and before). But to Smith's credit, he is sufficiently discursive without belaboring the points. If one hasn't encountered these so-called proofs before, I cannot imagine a better introduction to this standard faire.<br />This book is expansive, exhaustive, and exceedingly well-written. The author presumes no previous knowledge of philosophy by the reader, and explicates all necessary philosophical, psychological, and theological concepts with exceptional ease and simplicity (I wish philosophers as a rule were as lucid as Smith). Smith uses and cites an exceptionally broad number of scholars, religious and not, Protestant and Catholic, to demonstrate both sides of the arguments. He addresses primarily Christians, assuming the arguments against this most complex of religions will serve all theism. He is careful to distinguish between the nuances typically Protestant (liberal and evangelical) and typically Catholic -- which is a secondary benefit to understanding the significance of their intellectual and historical differences, even if the differences don't matter in the final analysis. The writing is impeccably simple, clear, and concise -- and only occasionally a little redundant.

Since then, my attitudes toward the book have changed. I still find Spong useful in showing that the book we know as the Bible is a collation of stories meant to point to a superhuman experience. This is both its strength and weakness.<br />The Bible is indeed a collation of different stories, some, indeed many, of which contradict each other. They don't contradict each other as to *material* matters, but as to \\"details\\" that simply cannot be reconciled. That two authors see the same events from two different perspectives that will yield two different stories is not unusual. In fact, it would be unusual if they materially and in detail agreed in every detail. It doesn't make the stories wrong, it just makes the idolatry of either story an injustice to the whole enterprise. To take these stories and freeze them literally is to make the stories, not the events, idolatry. On this point, Spong is right on.<br />That there a pluralism of interpretations does not defeat the meaning of the Bible's basic stories, rather it just defeats their literalism. Catherine of Siena wrote a millenium ago that the Bible must be understood in the manner in which it was written: SPIRITUALLY, not literally. To literalize the text is to idolatrize it. On this, St. Catherine and Spong agree. But St. Catherine has a deeper understanding of Scripture than Spong does.<br />According to the medieval maxim, scripture is first understood \\"literally\\" in the sense that the story is a tale that is coherent and meets with experience, then it is met spiritually, first morally, then allegorically, and finally, anagogically. The literal understanding is necessary to the ultimate anagogical understanding, but the literal gives way to the spiritual once our understanding of a text matures and grows.<br />Spong makes no mention of this medieval approach, and it makes for a serious flaw. For him it is either/or, not both/and. Either it is literal (which is ridiculous), therefore it is all a fable, is Spong's approach. St. Catherine's approach, which I find much more suitable to the reading of all texts, is that we encounter a text literally, and then we search its facial values for spiritual meaning and understanding. Both agree that being stuck in the literal mode does damage to our understanding, but Spong wants to dispense with any semblance of truth in the writings, while Catherine wants to capture the truths the various spokes of the wheel lead to.<br />Both agree that fundamentalism is idolatry, and anyone who extols the messenger over the Messenger is guilty of idolatry. The Bible is the \\"m\\" messenger, while God is the \\"M\\" Messenger. The messenger reaches us most primitively on the literal level, while we meet the Messenger most supremely at the anagogical level.

St. Catherine's approach, which I find much more suitable to the reading of all texts, is that we encounter a text literally, and then we search its facial values for spiritual meaning and understanding. Both agree that being stuck in the literal mode does damage to our understanding, but Spong wants to dispense with any semblance of truth in the writings, while Catherine wants to capture the truths the various spokes of the wheel lead to.<br />Both agree that fundamentalism is idolatry, and anyone who extols the messenger over the Messenger is guilty of idolatry. The Bible is the \\"m\\" messenger, while God is the \\"M\\" Messenger. The messenger reaches us most primitively on the literal level, while we meet the Messenger most supremely at the anagogical level.

There are myriads of commentaries, but none like this! This book elaborates at length on the short gospel narratives of the birth of Jesus, and how the NT authors had woven OT material into those narratives. It elaborates on the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary: not as some wench who did as God told her, but as the first disciple of Christ to say Yes to the call of God; not merely a mother to Christ, but the Mother of the people of God by her fiat. For those who already believe, and even for those who don't, it elaborates why the incarnation is such an awesome historial event, not only in human history, but in salvation history.<br />Fr. Brown writes with erudition, and, while his audience is scholarly, even novices can read these gems with considerable ease. I initially intended to read the book straight through, but the density and intensity of the material suggested that a more devotional, gradual read would be more beneficial. I admit this is hard to do, because once embarked, these insights propel one to read as much as one can as fast as one can. However you decide to read it, I cannot think of a better introduction, as well as advanced scholarship, that will not leave one unchanged.	2002-04-10

Yet, these features still require the reader to be already familiar with ethics, meta-ethics, metaphysics, and natural law. This book is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates; it's not directed toward a general readership. For a simpler, more straight-forward account cf, Finnis, &quot;Natural Law and Natural Rights,&quot; (OUP, 1982).<br />George defends the neo-Thomistic view of natural law as refined by Messrs. Grisez, Finnis, and Boyle. This is not an uncontroversial stance. The core of the book is Chapter III, where the Grisez, Finnis, and Boyle version of natural law that George intends to defend is given. The book is rigorous and examines natural-law theory from variegated angles and various detractors, making close reading of dense argument necessary. The early chapters presuppose knowledge of natural law theory; thus, neophytes may profitably read Chapter III first. Chapter II is reserved for those already versed in natural law theory and want a examination of meta-ethics nuances.<br />I didn't like the way the naturalistic fallacy is handled (more &quot;sidelined&quot;), as if it is a minor point to a major premise. But George's defense of natural law theory avoids the fallacy (norms derived from facts) by using the Grisez, Finnis, and Boyle model, and succeeds in staying clear of metaphysical foundations. This caveat aside, I know of no better, one-volume, exhaustive, and sustained argument for  natural law theory. It's dizzying reading, and even if inevitably unconvincing, generally worthwhile.	2002-04-07

These promises allude to precursors of natural law in its many variegated forms, some of which are not really \\"natural law\\" principles at all. Most of the discussion is about how some contemporary Thomists and neo-Thomists have approached the issue, but the reader cannot follow the subtle nuances of this discussion without knowing the meaning of natural law at the outset. The exposition of a reconsidered natural law follows this meandering, often uninteresting, introduction. In another confusion, the author discusses the impact of Moore's naturalistic fallacy on natural law before he describes what Aquinas' \\"natural law\\" is. So, over a hundred pages are heuristically inverted, leaving the reader to ponder future promises and anticipate an argument before he knows even the meanings of the terms of the argument drawn. If I did not already possess knowledge of Aquinas' natural law theory, these pages would have been meaningless; as it is, I found the points they may have been trying to make arcane, discursive, and near solipsistic.<br />Lisska insists upon ten fundamental principles necessary to serve the function of adopting Aquinas' natural law theory. Four of these principles require we accept \\"essences,\\" a medieval concept wholly foreign in modern philosophy. A fifth principle requires \\"truth\\" as a correspondence theory between mind and things (see, Searle, \\"Construction of Social Reality\\" for why this is no longer so). The other principles insist that (6) metaphysics of morals is possible, (7) that reason takes precedence over the affective will, &amp;c. In other words, one has to adopt the medieval, which is to say the Aristotlean, metaphysical schema in order for a \\"modern reconstruction\\" of Aquinas' natural law to succeed. Lisska writes, \\"In Aquinas's ontology, the dispositional paradigm holds only for temporal essences\\" (87), and again, \\"Divine commands must be in accord with the rational demands of the eternal law\\" (ibid), but it is precisely those very preconditions that makes Aquinas' natural law inimical to contemporary philosophy in the first place. I don't \\"see\\" what Lisska means by an \\"analytical reconstruction.\\" His writing is the most circumlocutious writing on Thomistic natural law as one can find; it would be better to assimilate it from the source: \\"Summa Theologica,\\" I-II, q. 90-97, esp. q. 94.<br />Finally, by page 107, we attain Lisska's definition of the natural law: &quot;Because the end itself determines the well-functioning of the human person. The disposition has, as a part of its very nature, a tendency towards a specific end. This end, when realized, contributes to the well-being of the individual. This is the crux of natural law theory. Nature has `determined', as it were, the ends which lead to the well-being of the individuals of the natural kind.&quot; From this nexus, the rest is downhill, as Lisska then evaluates how different scholastic and neo-scholastic philosophers of this past century have adapted this explication into their working-definitions. It's a tremendous bore, not at all enlightening, and of relative useless speculation on its applicability today. If it weren't for Robert George's excellent work in the field, I would have tossed natural law theory out the window. The book is that bad.<br />I routinely buy from Oxford University Press based on their unparalleled quality of authors and editors. How this travesty passed its high editorial standards is deeply puzzling.

While Swinburne goes back to Anselm and Aquinas, this book considers mostly post-1500 theodicy, still covering the ontological argument from Descartes' and a posteriori arguments from Hume.  The full spectrum of the arguments for and against God are here, including Kant, Newman, Kierkegaard, James, Phillips, Leslie, Kung, et alia.<br />First, a brief exposition of a philosopher's argument is surveyed, followed by an analysis of where the philosopher's strengths and weaknesses lie. There is even a section on the most notorious of all arguments against the existence of God: the existence of evil. In the final analysis, Mackie believes theism is itself a mircle, hence the title. Overall, this book makes a significant contribution to beginning philosophy students who want a rigorous examination of the crucial questions of God's existence and non-existence. The writing is clear, generally concise, exceptionally well-constructed, and only occasionally labyrinthine.	2002-04-04

I stuck with it, and found I wasn't rewarded. The book's premise is that there are objective philosophical reasons, and upon this premise, one has to consider the validity of doing history the &quot;old&quot; way, rather than submit to historicism. After struggling with the text, I cannot admit I am persuaded by this book, and, in fact, think it naive in light of recent scholarship in both philosophy and history.

I think we are indebted to his research assistant for the clarity of locution and punctuation -- two areas where Searle can be vulnerable. This book also uses many concepts discussed at length in two of his other books: \\"Speech Acts\\" and \\"Intentionality.\\" Having read these two other books, while definitely helpful, is not necessary, as Searle is kind enough to describe his meanings and references as he goes along. And he goes along at quite a rapid clip. This is, moreover, one of those books one cannot afford to skip a sentence without serious impairment of further understanding.<br /><br />With these caveats in mind, I highly recommend this tour of Searle's defense of naive realism in modern analytic terms. He is highly analytic, and builds quite a fortress that he is pained to defend against criticisms of circularity.  Nowhere is this charge more appropriate than in his defense of language as simultaneously being an \\"institutional\\" and \\"brute\\" fact. Each reader will have to decide whether or not he succeeds, but, if he has failed, it is not for a lack of effort.<br /><br />Of all Searle's books, this is the one I enjoyed the most. Searle is an excellent analytic philosopher, but a grammarian he's not. His lack of grammatical discipline usually interferes with his philosophizing and frequently plagues his other works, but is completely remedied in this book. It's not an \\"elegant\\" work, by any means, but it is clear, concise, and comprehensible. His arguments are thoroughly explained, developed, and explored, so that even a novice could follow his impeccable logic. And, there are an abundance of arguments, new linguistic devices, and formulations and reformulation of his ideas to sustain his central motif: Objective reality is objectively real.<br /><br />This is a great display of analytic thoroughness, coupled with a generous amplification of his ideas.

Those looking for a book to help formulate and construct an argument, idea, or story will NOT find it here. This book, by the author's admission, presupposes an existent text that needs rewriting...  For authors wanting to make their existent manuscripts more alive and active, Williams' book makes a nice complement.<br />The author observes that his book is meant to help the writer \\"rewrite\\" what is already written with the aid of numerous amorphous rules. Such things as writing in the present tense and in active form are pervasively recommended. The use of clauses, including restrictive and non-restrictive clauses, helps the author amend, clarify, and refine. All these admonitions are generally useful. Indeed, many of his suggestions may help writers overcome \\"writer's block,\\" and get the story underway. Whenever I encounter a mental block, I have found this book useful in penetrating the veil of confusion and obfuscation.<br />But Williams' approach to grammar and syntax is often flippant. While his advice to avoid nominalizations is to be approved, some kinds of writing simply cannot avoid it without diminuition of either the argument or the author or both. Another striking example of Williams' problem is the use of commas in serializations: Strunk and White, together with every dictionary containing a section on the use of commas, recommends the use of a comma after a serial of elements and before the conjunction; Williams thinks this rule unnecessary. The ultimate comma is optional. Like so many of Williams' opinions, rules are merely options, left to the author's discretion in their use. BUNK! Grammatical and syntactical devices, like rewriting, go to the very heart of clarity and elegance. The breach of protocols (with his examples by great writers) does not give license to every future writer to do likewise. Good grammar and syntax are every bit as important to clarity and grace, as are Williams' insistence to write actively and avoid the passive.illiams' insistence to write actively and avoid the passive.	2002-03-14

Newman asserts that the &quot;magisterium&quot; (although he doesn't use the word) comes into existence through pastoral consultation of the faithful. Newman shows that many times the Church held views it later discarded, because those views were ultimately disavowed by the faithful.

But that much one could ascertain from the title.<br />What the title does not reveal is how penetrating Berlin's analyses of the myriad subjects he comments on. His prose is exemplary, and his style endearing. Many learned people think Lionel Trilling, Erich Auerbach, Jacques Barzun, etc., are the men of letters for the 20th century reader. As enjoyable as many of these and other authors of the 20th century have been, I am amazed at how infrequently Berlin is listed among them. Yet, his mind is keener, his prose more mellifluous, and his ideas more interesting than almost anyone else of his Age.<br />Berlin is not a difficult read, but he is a challenging one. His weave of ideas and his elaborate critiques will require attention, but give him your attention, and he'll reward you plenteously. He is a genuine philosopher who deals with issues of the common man, not the nuances of linguistics; he is concerned with freedom, the life well-lived, and ideas that are important (not just fasionable).

This book, however, takes on special significance. Not only is it well-written, displaying the craft of the novelist as it matured in the mid-nineteeth century, but like many of his fellow Russians, he captures the imagination, themes, ideas, and sensibilities of presence that make Turgenev a twentieth-century joy to read.<br />This alone is sufficient warrant to read the book. But, there's equally important social reasons to read it. Turgenev is to the novel what Nietzsche is to philosophy, and that they were cotemporaneous is no mistake. &quot;Fathers and Children&quot; is a novel about nihilism, despair, and raw will to power in a vein too similar to Nietzsche to be ignored.<br />What makes Turgenev singularly important is his writing one of the truly &quot;post-modern&quot; novels as far as his themes go, but writing within the classical tradition of a well-developed plot, story, characters, ideas, and psychology. In many ways, Turgenew anticipates Freud, Kierkegaard, Joyce, and Eliot, while retaining the style of Hawthorne, Austin, and de Balzac. It's a wonderful synthesis -- a masterful story with critically important ideas and themes.	2002-03-01

He undertook to write a compendium of Aristotlean philosophy, Christian theological tradition, and a comprehensive survey of all knowledge up to the thirteenth century. That masterpiece is the \\"Summa Theologica,\\" which is available in English in either five, densely typed volumes (English Fathers) or in the sixty-volume Blackfriars edition for Oxford.<br />Tying to tackle such a wealth of information on one's own, most likely the only way short of catholic university in which to do so, is a hard nut to crack. Aquinas writes in a style very different from today's writers. While his work is very systematic, its breadth and depth can sometime cause one to lose their way. What did he say? is often a rejoinder by modern readers.<br />This is where Fr. Glenn's \\"Tour of the Summa\\" becomes a Godsend. In a single volume, Fr. Glenn condenses the \\"nugget\\" of each chapter and question in the multi-volume work into a sentence of two -- sometimes, when necessary, into lengthier paragraphs. Stripped from the original is the \\"pro\\" and \\"con\\" arguments that Aquinas uses to introduce and conclude each of his arguments. Instead, Fr. Glenn focuses entirely on the position Aquinas took that is central to each question.<br />With this book side-by-side to the complete Summa, the reader will not get lost in the forest for the trees. The Tour gives the reader the core thesis, while allowing the reader to develop the thesis-antithesis parts and the argument itself on his own. So Glenn is not doing the work for the reader by explicating each question and answer, but rather is nudging the reader to stay on track with core ideas while exploring the argument and the thesis-antithesis for himself.<br />Despite its age and antiquity, the Summa Theologica still speaks to those who devote time, energy, and effort into the endeavor. There is no comparable book in all of history, and for that reason, it remains a \\"Great Book of Western Civilization.\\" But to tackle such an encyclopedic work without the aid of Glenn's \\"Tour\\" is needlessly adding to the difficulty. This is one of those books one reads over a lifetime, and thanks to Fr. Glenn, one can do so without fear of getting lost.and effort into the endeavor.

As a resource document, it is without parallel after the Documents of Vatican II.<br />The documents of Vatican II are a clearer, wider, and more spiritual exposition of what the Church today believes. But sometimes, with so many mixed messages from pulpit and revisionists, the Documents of Vatican II can present difficulties to those uncertain of core beliefs.<br />That's where this book comes in. This book is systematic theology at its best. It posits the dogmas of the Church in a clear and unequivocal manner, and then goes about supplying the historical foundations for these dogmas. These foundations include ecumenical councils as well as writings of the saints. If a certain proposition is &quot;de fide,&quot; it is of unquestioned belief. But there are other propositions that are not &quot;de fide,&quot; that are provided to sharpen the core deposit from speculative ideas.<br />I refer to this book often when I come across propositions I find either doubtful or equivocal. Not only does it provide the clear and unadulterated truths of the catholic faith, but it provides the raison d'etre for those truths, making it a wealth of clear exposition of why catholics believe what they believe.	2002-02-25

As a master of prose, if, for no other reason, he deserves wide readership.<br />But, alas, Newman is first and foremost a theologian. Now this may cast aspersions on him to a larger audience, but at considerable distress to all concerned. He wrote as both an Anglican and a Roman Catholic (most of these sermons were written while he was a priest in the Church of England). Most of the sermons were delivered while he served as priest at Oxford. There he had a demanding audience, who wouldn't sit still for such simple ejaculations, such as, &quot;the Bible says so.&quot;<br />Newman revered Holy Scripture, but he saw it through a prism of manifold colors and applications. It was above all else a book of spiritual perfection, dense and more complex than often acknowledged, and he set forth to elucidate many passages with his incisive prose. Some of these sermons address the Christian liturgical year; others address some spiritual issue of the day or of perennial value. But in any event, his use of scripture is devoutly and reverential, even a tad dogmatic, but never in the evangelical sense. For Newman, the Word was a catalyst to self-discovery and illumination, not some sword to cut believer from infidel.<br />This book is large, and fortunately will take a good deal of time to read. Each sermon is about four pages, which makes for relatively-short meditations upon ideas catholic and universal. While Scripture forms his benchmark, his methodology is atypically in the English Empiricist school. He doesn't pontificate as though an authority, but examines like a scientist; he's heuristic, and we share in his discoveries. And his method allows him to reach the largest possible audience, knowing, as he did, that he was fighting both modernism and scepticism that ravaged the Church of England at the time, and continues to this day.<br />His method prevents sentimentality, although he is immensely sensitive and spiritual. He appeals to reason, the one thing that distinguishes man from beasts, and he does so with such eloquent prose that the reading alone is itself a delight. His insights have made him the &quot;Father&quot; of Vatican II, and many of his ideas can be found in documents of the Council. He doesn't seem to have a personal agenda, just an unabashed search for revealed truth as it is applied by reason. At times, his Victorian Age comes through loudly and clearly, but even so, his temperament is not one of self-righteousness, but of universal holiness. He's mediating the search for truth and holiness, not making it his own.<br />Roman and Anglican Catholics will be pleased with the results. Curious non-Christians will find Newman to be more than capable exegete, a rigorous and deft rhetorician, and a charming voice in a wasteland of mediocrity.prevents sentimentality, although he is immensely sensitive and spiritual.

In today's lexicon, his liberalism is closer to libertarianism, although I caution readers not to dismiss this book if they dismiss the political movement.<br />What von Mises intends to show in easy to read eloquent prose is that capitalism and democracy are natural complements to a free society. Betwixt the two, prosperity and freedom of choice have been maximized beyond all other systems, and the general well-being benefits all, even those on the lowest economic rung. This is not a comprehensive exegesis of economics that one will find in von Mises' \\"Human Action.\\" Rather, it is a general survey of the dominant themes that are given their fuller voice in his more detailed analysis. Thus, this book is an excellent introduction to democratic economics in general and to capitalism in particular.<br />What makes the book particularly engaging is its polemical tone. It is not a polemic, but it never loses sight of its opponents, and frequently takes socialism and critics of capitalism to task for their anxiety over the merits of being free.<br />After a brief introduction that is thoroughly engaging, von Mises covers four broad themes: (1) The foundations of liberalism and its policies; (2) liberalism's economic policies; (3) implications of liberalism in foreign policy; and (4) how liberalism is manifested in the political process. It's in the last section that he deals with doctrinaire liberalism and why, short of necessary regulations, the market must be free if man is to be free. Von Mises is unapologetically extreme in his views, and those of us who have come to expect an interventionist economic system will see why a \\"well-regulated\\" market economy has shortcomings. Alas, however, von Mises does not address the circumstances surrounding deceit, fraud, and other malfeasance (which is the book's only shortcoming).<br />The \\"liberal\\" of today will also learn a great deal about himself. Von Mises explores the reasons for socialism's popularity and staying power, despite its predeliction towards despotism, totalitarianism, and ineptitude. Socialism has no rational basis for existence, but it does have a very strong psychological dynamic that von Mises admits (and frankly doesn't discuss enough in this book).<br />After reading this short volume, readers will likely want to investigate these ideas further. Von Mises was a prolific author, and tackles many issues in any number of his works. Certainly, \\"Socialism\\" and \\"Human Action\\" are two of his major works that may find interest. Furthermore, one of von Mises' pupils was Frederick Hayek, one of the preeminent thinkers of the twentieth century.<br />If you want a concise, short, and eloquent introduction to classical liberalism, I can think of no better book to serve this function. Eschew some of the latter-day libertarians, and read from the foundational author of our times.circumstances surrounding deceit, fraud, and other malfeasance (which is the book's only shortcoming).<br />The \\"liberal\\" of today will also learn a great deal about himself.

There are rules, such as, &quot;'that' introduces essential clauses[,] while 'which' introduces non-essential clauses.&quot; Nobody in the English language uses phrases like 'essential' and 'non-essential' phrases. Notions like 'restrictive' and 'non-restrictive' clauses are wholly absent, replaced by the author's own clever, but largely private, jargon. Many of the rules are given without explaining the reason for English use in a certain way. Some of the rules seem so obvious as to be silly: &quot;Use concrete rather than vague language.&quot; The rules for the use of 'effect' versus 'affect' are almost unintelligible. For example, &quot;If none of the above [rules] fit, use 'affect.'&quot; The two words have different uses that are clear to delineate, so why the abstraction by exclusion? Or, how about the rule, &quot;Use commas to set off expressions that interrupt the folow of the sentence,&quot; which is used instead of a 'parenthetic phrase', which would have much more meaning. It's this avoidance of the classical language of grammar that is perhaps most annoying, but there are plenty of omissions that are equally affecting. Much attention is spent on the distinction between whomever and whoever (words not commonly used, and the reasons given are not all that clear). Even some illustrations are wrong. One example is: &quot;I expect five hundred dollars ($500),&quot; wherein the phrase &quot;five-hundred&quot; should be hypenated. When it comes to punctuation, no mention is made of brackets within parenthesis.<br />With these many grievances, it is simply not possible to rate this grammar book highly. There are simply too many problems with grammatical rules, examples used as illustrations that are wrong, too many punctuation rules omitted, and absolutely nothing on style (as in &quot;Elements of Style&quot; by Funk and White). If someone wants a more detailed &quot;Elements of Style&quot; that concerns only grammar, I recommend the use of Blanche Ellsworth's &quot;English Simplified,&quot; Fifth Edition (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row).more detailed &quot;Elements of Style&quot; that concerns only grammar, I recommend the use of Blanche Ellsworth's &quot;English Simplified,&quot; Fifth Edition (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row).	2001-09-20

This is a particularly difficult anomaly, because the author is the progenitor of the theory. If he cannot articulate the theory well, how does he expect others to use its principles to good effect? I tired of it several times, and finally discontinued reading it. Glasser doesnt even begin to explain the theory until chapter four - after three lengthy, insignificant, and meandering chapters. When he finally gets to describing the theory, he doesnt articulate any of its principles, only examples of some of its applications. Now, it is often desirable to show the use of principles by example, but not at the expense of not citing principles of how to use what the examples intend to portray. The theory is simply this: One always can make choices that fit the best available opportunities and desires, even when there is overt conflict and avoidance. Take this principle and apply it to every level of ones life. If these statements are accurate, they should have been clearly enunciated early in the book. Most of the book is fluff of how to apply this principle in a variety of different ways. Its how he gets from a single page to the books redundant and verbose 340 pages.	2001-08-26

J. Ayer, G. E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, one has to place Russell in the foreground as the philosophers' philosopher. He writes with clarity and lucidity. His concerns are largely logical and epistemological. And this book centers around his principal concerns.<br />I doubt that Russell would write this same book today, but I also doubt that he would fundamentally alter the positions he takes, if he were writing today. There is something neat, eloquent, and elegant about his epistemological premises that make this work (well beyond its 17th printing and more than eighty years old) such a venerable treasure trove. Could his positions be better articulated? Yes, but not by much. Would he delve more deeply into logic? Almost certainly. And he does, in other books written during his lifetime.<br />This book is really for the novice. My only complaint is that the novice will probably remain lost if his readings did not encompass more logic and criticism of rational and empirical epistemology. What makes Russell a true \\"modern\\" in contemporary philosophy is his bridge to resolving both the rationalist and empiricist schools of thought. One not knowing these dichotomies might find Russell's resolution difficult to follow. Elsewhere in the book, Russell identifies \\"three\\" rules of thought, when these rules are no longer considered all that are extent. Generally, there are seven, sometimes nine, taught in most symbolic logic courses, and this discrepancy may needlessly cause confusion. So while the book is written for the novice, it bears re-reading after covering other contemporary writers.<br />Russell and the others mentioned above are often associated with logical atomism, either directly or indirectly. Reading Russell or Ayer gives the student the best opportunity to do philosophy whilst learning it first hand. Both are explicit writers with Ayer perhaps having the upper hand. But, as with any philosophical school, such as logical atomism, there is always a counter reaction, and A. L. Austin's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is just such a reproach. Russell, like Ayer, uses the construct of \\"sense data\\" to explain the theory of knowledge; Austin and Gilbert Ryle redress both author's use of such \\"metaphysical\\" interpolations, which makes for an interesting contrast. Any reader of Russell or Ayer should counterbalance his reading with Austin's work.<br />\\"The Problems of Philosophy\\" is not without gaps that may leave the reader puzzled by the omissions. Perhaps they weren't as obvious when Russell wrote this book, but they are clearer now in hindsight. An egregious omission is the absence of anything to do with ethics or moral theory. Since ethics is one of the few domains particular to philosophy alone, this omission is particularly troublesome in a book of this name.

I suspect he is trying so hard to be anglo-analytic in his approach that he forgot that art touches the heart as well as the mind. Wollheim focuses entirely on the mind, and the mind games that ensue do little to enlighten one's understanding of art and its objects, what and why they do what they, and why they're important. This book was used in a course I had with Wollheim as a lecturer; both could not have been more boring and banal. The book was widely resold as many students didn't bother to read it, or began to read it and gave up. The consensus was nearly unanimous in irrelevance to the artist especially, and no less irrelevant to the philosophy students.	2001-08-12

Thomism doesn't have a philosophy of the &quot;aesthetic,' a notion wholly alien to the medieval mind. So Eco has to kind of create such a notion from a plethora of Thomas' writings. Fortunately, Eco does stay on track, even if he creates and follows tangents widely, by staying focused on the contribution ART (vis-a-vis &quot;aesthetics&quot;) offers to modern sensibility.<br />Frankly, if one wants a better understanding of Medieval attitudes toward art, Emile Male's &quot;Gothic&quot; is incomparable. Male's work is a tour d'force and a &quot;must&quot; for anyone seriously interested in medieval art.<br />Even Jacques Maritain's &quot;Art and Scholasticism&quot; does a better job of presenting Thomistic views on art and beauty. The same can be said of Josef Pieper, who has written many books on art and the scholastic mind.<br />Eco, who made a name for inviting deconstruction into the Italian worldview, is better skilled at directing his attentions to that field than the medieval notions, concepts, and theories of art and beauty. If one wants a more concolidated assessment of the &quot;philosophical&quot; underpinnings of scholasticism's attitude toward art, simply read Aristotle. The scholastic view isn't much different, except that it is differently deployed in a manner consistent with Male's &quot;Gothic.&quot;<br />This book bored me.	2001-08-12

Built upon the foundations of de Saussure, semiotics is taken to its ultimate scam, namely that the plurality of readings and dangling verbs and nouns make stable meanings impossible.<br />But alas, Kripke and others have shown that nouns and verbs do have stable meanings, that the logic of deconstruction degrades into its own circularity, and that differences in meanings does not mean there are no shared meanings. What's rude about this book and others like it is that it cannot just say this, but has to create neologism and syntatical abuse after abuse to hint at this thesis (otherwise, the simple declaration of what it is would undermine its very theoretical basis).<br />But, don't be fooled or lulled into silly syntax and semantics that is more giddy and goofey than substantive and think the inpenetrable language therefore substantiates its &quot;non-claims.&quot; The skeptic, which is a core constituency of this kind of book, will always find ways not to agree with others, but that doesn't mean there isn't shared knowledge, much less that language is so unstable as to have any shared meaning.<br />In a nutshell, this is verbose nonsense.

As a method, however, structuralism seems far more serious and articulate than its successor.<br />This is the best overview of structuralism ever. I initially found it in the library, and after reading it thoroughly, determined it was a book necessary for my own library. I found it compelling on a number of fronts, from figurative fiction to solipsistic fiction, and on most other fronts as well.<br />Sadly, most English departments have &quot;moved on&quot; to deconstruction, having abandoned structuralism to the dust heap of analysis. All the work of de Saussure, Barthes, and others have simply been deposed. Still, there's more merit in this one book than all the books written on deconstruction.<br />The reader is asked to examine texts in a peculiar way that serves both atemporality as well as temporality.

Newman wrote four magisterial works (not including his large body of sermons) of which this Essay is one of the most important and influential. It is perhaps the most accessible of J.H.N.'s works, and the most significant.<br />The problem that Newman wants to resolve is how can Christian doctrine develop, if, as is commonly believed, Jesus embodied all revelation, once and for all. Another way of attacking the same problem is to determine how certain doctrines not stated in an overt manner in the Bible (e.g., purgatory) can be shown to be a licit and legitimate development based on scriptural integrity. Newman doesn't hold the view that the Bible itself is the only form of revelation, but he does hold the view that subsequent development of doctrine cannot repudiate biblical statements. Broadly and coherently developed, Newman shows that development of  Christian doctrine under certain restrictions is both necessary and fundamental to the Christian dispensation.<br />Where Newman is less convincing is with more recent papal doctrines like the immaculate conception and the assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary. While these latter two doctrines have different aetiologies, one clearly developed in a manner consistent with scripture while the other is plainly contradictory. The Assumption (or else, Dormition, Glorification, etc.) of Mary has very ancient traditions and is the manifestation of the doctrine of our own glorification on the Last Great Day. Conversely, the immaculate conception was determined by Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor and preeminent theologian of the church, to be inconsistent with the sacred deposit once and forever revealed and directly contradicted by scripture.<br />What do these two doctrines have to do with Newman's book? Newman wants to insist the doctrine continues to &quot;evolve&quot; or &quot;develop,&quot; but that this growth, be be licit and legitimate, must be consistent with the initial sacred deposit once received, and that this development must grow organically out of that which the Church has inherited and must not be a novation or innovation. The doctrine of Papal primacy has likewise remained consistent with some form of belief from the Church's earliest beliefs, but the notion of papal &quot;supremacy&quot; is of recent origin and not consistent with scripture or church history. Both papal supremacy and the immaculate conception are at odds with the Church's earliest positions, was repudiated in the Middle Ages, and is contrary to Scripture's insistence.<br />So Newman's task is a difficult one. He wants to defend the Roman tradition, but the Roman tradition, especially as it embarked on the nineteenth century, created a few novations that and innovations it heretofore had repudiated. Newman, I think, succeeds in walking this fine line of showing how the sacred deposit fully and for all time singularly received does develop over time by the synthesis of episcopal collegiality, consensus fidelium, sacred scripture, and venerable tradition. Newman's hermeneutic allows for the Spirit to breathe multiple understandings of the same ostensible dogma in such a way as to be said to &quot;grow,&quot; but it remains consistent with the original deposit through the four-fold synthesis through which the Holy Spirit operates.<br />Where a chasm occurs is with doctrinal novations, such as the immaculate conception and papal supremacy. The dogma of the immaculate conception is not only INCONSISTENT and INCOHERENT, it is also CONTRARY, to the received tradtions; likewise, the magisterial belief in the primacy of the Petrine See having been remade into the supremacy of Papal infallibility. In all candor, it is Newman who remains consistent, while the Church that has breached its historical deposit.<br />Newman, except for these two important exceptions, shows how development of doctrine is not only consistent, but necessary, over time. To keep the Church static in one solitary interpretation or understanding is to deny the Church's variety of charisms.

I can see easily why it was chosen. It is written with academic rigor based in the social sciences but often reads like a self-help book. In a critical way, it is both. As a textbook, it reads with vigor and analycity of the behavioral sciences and analytic philosophy, and as a self-help book, it reads like a serious, intelligent discussion of the scientific bases for meanings in one's life.<br />The book is clearly interdisciplinary, and is suitable for college-level coursework in the fields of philosophy, pyschology, and sociology. The author begins by forming four existential criteria for evaluating the meanings of life (note the plurality): (1) Purpose, (2) Value, (3) Efficacy (or Control), and (4) Self Worth. Based on these logical and practical foundations, Baumeister analyzes a plethora of life events and enculturation: Work, Family, Religion, Sex, Love, Happiness, Death, and many varients on these central themes. The book's singular achievement is the revelation or apotheosis of the &quot;self&quot; as a modern predicament vis-a-vis its historical antecedents.<br />It succeeds in formulating a high-level of discussion without ambiguity or confusion; it is remarkable for its clarity. The average page contains about seven references to other authorities that provide simultaneously the careful research that has been undertaken to provide this comprehensive overview, while offering the student/reader the resources to pursue additional tangents on their own. The bibliography is better than average, omitting some significant contributors I would have liked to have seen interwoven into the over-arching examination. My largest reservation to recommendation of this book is the total absence of evolutionary consideration from any of the various venues. The absence of instinct and environment mar the book seriously.<br />This book should appeal to almost anyone who has an above-average intelligence, the ability to think critically, and an interest in rational discourse concerning the meanings we import and export in our lives. This book is not only designed for academia and the above-average cognocenti, but for businesses and other organizations to understand the dynamics and praxeology in today's culture vis-a-vis our inheritance. As one who read it for pleasure, I found myself taking copious notes and underlining numerous passages.

There is no better single source of doing philosophy via the logical positivism method than by reading this book. It's really two books in one. The Introduction is a rather thorough reply to his critics of the book's original lengthier substance, and if nothing else is read, the Introduction provides an excellent example of what logical positivism is, why it is regarded highly or poorly depending on the reader, and why some people think this kind of analysis defeats the whole purpose of philosophy. The book does try to end metaphysics as we know it, but in the course of establishing new principles (i.e., verifiability), it itself becomes indefensible against the accusation of itself relying on its own premises to prove its own conclusions (a charge Ayer coyly ignores), otherwise known as circularity.<br />The fact that many Anglo-American philosophers still do philosophy in this manner -- after Ayer's style -- is reason alone to study this book thoroughly. It is concisely written, clear and unambiguious (if not a tad bit too analytical), and exemplary of Anglo-American style of doing philosophy. I don't think too many philosophers subscribe to its own circular metaphysics, but many, if not most, current philosophers adopt its principles as a &quot;method&quot; -- something which Ayer later (in &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;) claims was his aim all along.<br />What is disappointing to me, at least in the body of Ayer's works read thus far, is his failure to address &quot;verifiability&quot; in light of Popper's &quot;falsification&quot; doctrine. What exactly constitutes &quot;verifiability&quot; or empirical truth? And, how does the verification of empirical truth differ from the &quot;empirical falsification&quot; of Popper? Perhaps Ayer addresses this problem somewhere, but I've not found it. It would be an interesting problem to see solved.	2001-08-03

He even succeed in grand poetry (Pale Fire), so one would think that his literal translation of Oneigin would be a welcome publication. It's not. First, Nabokov strips Onegin of all poetics, which he admits is his intent. He believes the poem is better understood from a transliteral (almost interlinear) reading than from a poetic reconstruction. This attempt may please, and I stress &quot;may,&quot; those who, unfamiliar with Russian, and who want such a bland diet of lackluster prose. But there are so many excellent translations of Onegin that are beautiful and captivating in themselves, I'm not sure there's much need for such a literal, word-for-word, transcription. Perhaps this book belongs on the shelf along with other translations of Onegin, but it's not one I'll return to in the near future.	2001-07-27

Written shortly after WWI, there are occasional references to people and things no longer on the modern radar scope. And, as philosophical writing goes, Russell is better than most in constructing intelligible sentences and paragraphs that don't require repeated reading to understand.<br />This book is about life. Russell uses his analytic empiricism to discuss typically pop-psychological issues: Boredom, Excitement, Envy, Sin, Persecution, Public Opinion, Zest, etc. But his approach, dated back in time, is refreshingly new and helpful in the present. Indeed, Russell shows himself redolent in wisdom, the true aim of philosophy, and tackles issues that are at the core of what constitutes happiness and its opposites.<br />Because Russell appeals to his empirical views analytically arrived, there is a sense of wonderment and awe at such simple solutions to difficult problems in modern life. These solutions aren't dressed in pop-ism, but in a perennial philosophy that takes wisdom, not pop-up tapes of life, seriously.<br />The Atlantic Monthly claimed this book to be a &quot;primer of self-regeneration . . . a most excellent book.&quot; This praise is not unwarranted, and given that commonsense is the center of the whole enterprise, its wisdom will endure not only when it was written in the 1920s, but today, and tomorrow.	2001-07-19

Unlike its predecessor, the Great Books of Western Civilization, this compendium broadens its horizons to include Eastern literature as well as Western.<br />There's no question that many of the books recommended one read over the course of one's lifetime are truly meritorious, but there have crept in a few books which are interesting only because they appeal to a non-Western reader. Fair enough, but it tends to reduce the important works of civilization to a lower common denominator. Also, there are some serious omissions, as most of the attention is devoted to &quot;literature,&quot; and not to works in philosophy, praxelogy, axiology, social and scientific history, and political, economic, and scientific breakthroughs.<br />If one desires a list of the great books in all fields of endeavor, this is NOT the book. Too many books are omitted for that kind of enterprise. Indeed, looking at the Great Books website will provide a better list of books that really deserve our attention, and make our devotion to reading them perennially valuable. However, if literature is one's only interest, then this can be a helpful overview.	2001-07-19

It's an exceedingly masterful task that is richly rewarding, if only slightly frustrating because of his poor syntactical structures.<br />Analytic philosophy is often difficult enough, and this book is of average difficulty, but when an author does not write clearly with near-run-on sentences, myandering and labyrinthine syntax, and in less than necessary obtuseness, it is a drawback. This is my only complaint.<br />Part of the problem is the author's, part reader's. Searle is going against the analytic grain by expositing a theory of mind that is at once novel and distinctive, clearing up confusions and ambiguities along the way. But these new ideas and the direction of fit they present are exciting and facinating, even if the presentation is less than perfect.<br />It's hard to imagine modern-day analytic philosophers going out on a limb with actual theory (they tend toward the criticism of others), so that it is refreshing that someone of Mr. Searle's reputation and caliber takes a stab at presenting a coherent theory of mind in new dress and ambiance: Naive realism.<br />This isn't the first book of Searle's I'd recommend. That honor goes to \\"Mind, Language, and Society,\\" his short, but densely argued, and clearer exposition, of several ideas (some of which he adumbrates from this volume). If you like what you read in THAT book, this book will further delight you.<br />What's so agreeable about Searle, if not his syntax, is his willingness to posit a coherent theory of mind in the traditional vein but in entirely new clothing. It's refreshing to see a modern philosopher actually doing philosophy, not critiquing the philosophy of others. Searle would probably have advanced his cause by having someone else tidy up his presentation, as this drawback reduces the splendor of the overall book.	2001-07-11

These two essential features arise from a synergy of episcopal collegiality, consensus of the faithful, venerable tradition, and only then sacred scripture. Only those Christians who have perverted Christianity by extolling the Bible above the other three features are ensnared in its web. And, within this web, the Bible can be made to represent all sorts of contrary positions. This book takes the Bible in this preverse context and then argues that the Bible can be made to represent a point of view that is gay-friendly.<br />But the Bible makes clear in both Old and New Testaments that homosexuality is not to be approved of. The Levitical Code of Holiness and the Prologue of Paul's Letter to the Romans are unmistakable indictments against homosexuality, even if Christians are no longer bound by the Levitical Code of Holiness, and even if Paul's Prologue is actually a larger piece on his repudiation of idolatry. For these reasons, we can argue that the Bible is less hostile than one might suspect, but it is nevertheless hostile.<br />But even reaching this state of awareness doesn't do much to resolve the other features that go toward a Christian's understanding of homosexuality. Mitigating the anti-gay rhetoric of the Bible doesn't obviate the perennial teaching of the Christian community (i.e., Church) through its bishops, consensus of the faithful, and venerable tradition that homosexuality does not fit into God's ordained plan of salvation. In this context, re-interpreting the Bible to fit a gay-friendly agenda still pits homosexuality against other, more visceral opposition.<br />We do see some mainline Protestant Churches re-examining their own ecclesiastical stances; we've seen liberal Judaism do likewise; but Catholics and others have always disapproved of homosexuality based on &quot;evidence&quot; other than the Bible. For them, the issue of homosexuality does not &quot;fit&quot; the natural order, which in turn is a part of the divine order, and the presupposed teleology of &quot;human nature.&quot; It is this tradition that has been, and continues to be, the most poigant argument against homosexuality (even if it can be changed).<br />I give the book 3 stars for its gay-friendly reinterpretation of biblical passages, which it does fairly well; however, given the larger scope of Christian tradition based upon episcopal collegiality, consensus of the faithful, and venerable tradition, this book doesn't begin to scratch the surface that other books, like John Boswell's, have.natural order, which in turn is a part of the divine order, and the presupposed teleology of &quot;human nature.&quot; It is this tradition that has been, and continues to be, the most poigant argument against homosexuality (even if it can be changed).<br />I give the book 3 stars for its gay-friendly reinterpretation of biblical passages, which it does fairly well; however, given the larger scope of Christian tradition based upon episcopal collegiality, consensus of the faithful, and venerable tradition, this book doesn't begin to scratch the surface that other books, like John Boswell's, have.	2001-07-08

There aren't many books that can make this kind of claim. First, it is written so that the average person can understand it on first reading without intensive study. This isn't a grandiose claim, given that so much of early psychology is now an integral feature of social institutions.<br />Secondly, it is largely purged of some of Jung's more outrageous and nonsensical ideas, like his &quot;collective unconscious.&quot; The scope of the book is limited primarily to the effect and use of symbols in everyday life, particularly as it affects dreams.<br />Third, everyone dreams, and after reading this book, the reader will have a great tool by which to analyze many of these dreams. Those who try to interpret their dreams literally (like reading the Bible literally) discover they have missed the point. The dreams of the subsconscious are symbolic images that need to be thoroughly interpreted in light of specific symbols and the meaning of these symbols -- and not the dream narrative itself.<br />Finally, mankind is defined by its being a rational animal with linguistic capacity. Language itself is both audible and visual signs and symbols of the mind. The very words we use to describe life's events are often chosen for their symbolic capacity, which can lead to an imprisonment of the mind or its liberation from man and his symbols.	2001-07-08

The author wants to resurrect the ideas of antique republicanism that he argues existed until the advent of classical and modern liberalism two centuries ago.<br />The book is bifurcated into a general theory that is extremely verbose, repetitious, and belabored. His tool is analytical philosophy, whereupon he takes each facet of antique republicanism and compares it to today's liberalism (classical and welfarist). I found this section could be easily skimmed without loss of the author's essential ideas and without becoming an albatross around the reader's neck. He claims that traditional republicanism held &quot;dominion,&quot; not &quot;Freedom&quot; as the republican ideal. Pettit thinks we've chosen the latter over the former to our own detriment. The republican ideal is to escape all forms of domination by others, and imperium by the government, rather than the liberal ideal of escaping all interference by others.<br />The second section deals with how the republican ideal could ideally be implemented. This part of the book seems particularly cursory. To no surprise after a lengthy adumbration, socialism is the answer to the master/slave relationships built upon liberal ideals. Modern capitalism is too laden with employer dominion and other forms of enslavement that Petit thinks are the core reasons for today's whims and caprice of one's power over others. Only socialism removes the arbitrary whims of the owner/renter, management/laborer, and other forms of boss/servant. The goal here is to eliminate all forms of &quot;arbitariness,&quot; which is a noble goal, and that makes man insecure and enslaved by that insecurity.<br />But Petit's prescription also calls for a major constitutional and social re-education in HIS form of government, with proper roles and division of powers, so that government itself doesn't move beyond mere domination on the individual toward imperium. He also extols the rule of law, which must be uniform and applicable to all (no special interest or special exemptions). Petit believes division of powers distributes power into too many hands and prevents government itself from becoming the great Dominion itself. He recognizes the tacit problem of bureaucracies in exercising its dominion over the &quot;lesser man,&quot; but thinks altruism and mind control will ultimately win out in his utopian resolutions.<br />There are all sorts of problems with this exposition. Besides the early tedium and ubiquitous redundancies, the author fails to deal with the dominion of State bureaucracies, individual power plays even within democratic republics, and the servitude that can occur when the State is in control of most civil life. Hayek, who also is strongly opposed to arbitrariness as a social evil, does much better than Pettit in constructing a social reality that is free of government imperium. In fact, Pettit seems to ignore Hayek's contributions to this important concept, failing to address that whenever the government takes, it rarely returns. Pettit believes that everyone will be &quot;educated&quot; by government to be civil, and from their civility, develop a non-dominion society that is carefully managed to avoid it from becoming its own imperium. Tell that to the Soviet Socialist Republics.<br />There are some interesting ideas, not the least of which, is the republican ideal of avoiding insecurity and capriciousness. But it seems that Pettit's State wants to do the ubiquitous work of free peoples, such that it too easily will turn into the very extremes of interference and imperium that is repugnant to the very values he extols. It would be nice to eliminate insecurity andarbitrariness from social life, but at what cost? In Pettit's mind, a the loss of freedom in exchange for liberty is an &quot;entitlement&quot; that republicanism is all about (sound curious? It is.)arbitrariness from social life, but at what cost?

Written with uncanny clarity, humor, and seriousness, the book tackles a host of situations and circumstances with a no-nonsense, clear-headed, and right-minded approach. One might quibble with one or two things, but overall, I've not encountered such a refreshing examination of the &quot;gay&quot; lifestyle and its orientation toward making sincere and secure commitments. It's breezy in style, hence there is little condenscension about some more significant issues (esp. when it comes to HIV and all its consequences). Had it attempted to answer every piccadilo, however, it wouldn't be as fun, entertaining, or as overall informative as it turned out to be. This book is an excellent resource for all gay men, offering provocative (and almost always true) observations about being gay (something most of us have not been taught). It is especially provocative and useful for those serious about making commitments.	2001-02-14

From this angle, the book is an interesting read of different religious views that have helped humans live an interesting, meaningful, and ethical lives. But &quot;philosophy&quot; is not really involved except incidentally. There is no use of logical clarity, no evaluation of arguments, no use of the philosphical method, nor much of any tools that philosophers normally apply. Indeed, none of the usual philosophical issues are to be found: Epistemology, metaphysics, theories of language, ethics, mind, and anthropology. But, as a digest of religious views, it does a nice job of harmonizing religious &quot;truths&quot; across a wide spectrum of religious thought, from Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Hindu thinkers. But the consequence of this &quot;harmonization&quot; is reductionism of different religious structures into an over-simplified, under-stated worldview and cosmology. So, even under the rubric of &quot;theodicy,&quot; the book fails its philosophical foundations.	2001-01-31

Then came Wittengenstein and the only person Wittgenstein believed truly understood his work, Gilbert Ryle (Elizabeth Anscombe should also be considered, but only Ryle is mentioned by name.) Ryle's most successful and enduring book is &quot;Concept of Mind,&quot; which does much if not all of debunking nearly all philosophy from Descartes to date with wit, style, and grace. &quot;Dilemmas&quot; is a different sort of book, and in my opinion, the more enjoyable of the two. First, it's considerably shorter. Second, it goes to the heart of dilemmas that have perplexed agile and senile minds for centuries. It takes into consideration about five seemingly irresolvable problems and demonstrates how these dilemmas are neither a dilemma nor even challenging dilemmas.<br />It what is clearly one of the best books on &quot;deconstructing&quot; problems that are artificial and mind games, and demonstrating how using language in its ordinary, not extraordinary, ways, Ryle shows how many philosophical problems are nothing of the sort. They are problems of language, not true problems of substance. Anyone who asks a stupid question will get a stupid answer, but Ryle goes beyond this platitude. He takes several very perplexing issues that have haunted philosophy from its nascent stages and debunks them through the use of &quot;ordinary language.&quot; No linguistic acrobatics of the existentialist ilk, no grand metaphysics of the Scholastic ilk, no analytical positivism according to the Austrian ilk -- all of which have lead nowhere, but, instead, a refreshing reexamination of the dilemmas themselves, and clear-headed, simply examined, ordinary explanation of things in an ordinary way.<br />This ingenious little book is not a tome of how the world looks, but is what philosophers call &quot;techne&quot;, or &quot;art,&quot; of how to dissolve problems that do not exist. Ryle doesn't ask and answer every question posed since the beginning of the world; rather, he takes a few isolated, but well-worked problems, and artfully and clearly shows how these &quot;problems&quot; aren't problems at all. They are confusions originating in linguistic abuse. Using five examples, he assumes that the reader can take with him the technique and apply it to other irrestible problems that really don't exist at all.

This petard hoisted on those desparately seeking an answer should be tossed in with all the other &quot;self-help&quot; suppositions that have no foundation in fact. It's rather silly to treat something that's so rare that even people with AIDS and HIV don't get! Sure, these poor souls are infected with candidia, but none are &quot;invaded&quot; in the intestines, except a rare few at the terminal stages of AIDS. Why, then, would so many women be at risk for something that the most immuno-suppressed people on the planet are not at risk? If just one scientific evidence had been cited, this nostrum might have some interest. But building a hypothesis on anecdotal herbal-craft, sending women who have serious illnesses in the wrong direction, borders on malpractice. So don't waste your money, much more importantly your time, on a hypothesis made of spun honey, written for no other ostensible purpose than to lear women into a false secuity about a disorder that doesn't exist.	2001-01-18

But, these writers' prejudices about incidental matters (e.g., homosexuality) tend to throw the authors off subject into temperamental tangents of irritating, often infuriating, polemics. Indeed, this tendency among these so-called conservative illuminati make them seem borish, immature, and wildly inflammatory about all the wrong things. Rather than lead us to appreciate the &quot;best&quot; in human history, after the excellence of Matthew Arnold, they tend to approach the matter by eloquent straw man sophistry. It makes them appear collectively as myopic narcisists, whose only worldview is what they hate. I hate &quot;jello,&quot; but what relevance does jello have with the excellence of a Berlioz composition? About as much as homosexuality has to the excellence of John Maynard Keynes' economics. Shooting the tree and getting lost in the forest is not a good sign for any critic; yet, nearly all are &quot;victims&quot; of this polemic. For individuals who despise victimhood, they fail to see their essays are filled with it; what they write often begets the very thing they profess to deplore. As articulate as these essays are, they are not very well-written. If looking to the past opens doors to the future, then reading Allen Tate, Isaiah Berlin, and Aldous Huxley are much better road maps to great ideas and fine literature, and much better critics than most of these amateurs.	2001-01-12

The coordination of the Gospel reading with the Old Testament lection is subordinated to an OT lectio-continuo, for those Protestants who prefer to preach on the OT rather than preach the Gospel. This is so harmful to modern hermenuetics and exegesis. The Gospel, which is central in the Roman Lectionary, becomes just another reading in the RCL. All efforts by Episcopalians toward a &quot;Season of Epiphany&quot; is moot. Immediately after Baptism Sunday, the &quot;Season of the Year&quot; begins until Lent, completely undermining the excursus of the liturgical seasons to expound on the economy of salvation. But by far the most detrimental decision to favor Protestants was the decision to de-couple the OT from the Gospel reading. An option is provided as an alternative, and the Episltes have no coordination at all. So the preacher is free, indeed compelled, to preach on one of the three lections, rather than using the insights of all three lections to form a Gospel proclamation. Given the advances of the Roman Lectionary, and given the chance to make real improvements by coordinating more of the readings, this revision is a throw-back to uncoordinated readings, and the apotheosis of the OT over the Gospel.	2001-01-05

It's a contorted read that breathes platitude after platitude, but does more to demonstrate how to write obscurely than with clarity. At first, I thought the book was a satire, deliberatly using ambiguity, the absence of punctuation, and the lack of clarity to make its points. But, that's clearly not the case. The authors seriously believe they are about making &quot;truth&quot; clearer, but then fail to make a single argument to support any of its propositions. This is one of the worst books on style and clarity I've seen. Not only is it superficial, but its grammatical and syntactical mistakes are glaring. Do the authors know anything of punctuation?

This is a textbook, not a leisurely &quot;how to&quot; book on how to write more creatively. The author is clearly oriented towards the classical rhetorical styles of ancient Greece and Rome, resurrected in the Renaissance, and largely a lost art after the Victorians. Despite the textbook orientation, it is a book the unschooled student of rhetoric can pick up and &quot;study.&quot; I emphasize &quot;study.&quot; One cannot breeze through this book. And, while many of the issues addressed apply to both writing and speaking, clearly this is a rhetorician's skillbook, not a grammarian's. The book is divided into three parts: Part I develops a strategy for speaking/writing as a cohesive whole; Part II develops the modes of argumentation, particularly the syllogism; and Part III, perhaps the least important in today's universe of knowledge, develops the tropes particular to rhetoric. There are better books on each of these three parts, but no book that incorporates all three any better. Take notes. Study. And you'll be richly rewarded.	2000-12-28

It's not only a treasure of Hayek's finest theses, but an excellent overview of human relations, the raison d'etre for a constitutional system, the importance of the rule of law, the radical notion of the separation of powers, and why the free market, while not flawless, remains the best economic system in the allocation, conservation, and efficiency of resources.<br />Hayek is often appropriated by Libertarians as one of them, but I find this claim unpersuasive. Hayek is a Republican in the sense of Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Goldwater, and hardly a disciple of Libertarian reductionism to a single rule that is inherently circular and contradictory! I know Libertarianism, and Hayek is no Libertarian.<br />He is, however, an excellent proponent of positive and negative freedoms within a rule-based society, wherein the rule of law is not the Rule by Laws. He finds all forms of anarchy, arbitrariness, and single powers inherently bent against the truest sense of freedom. Freedom itself is not an absolute law, as in the case of being the means rather than the end, but that a world of spontaneous associations under the rule of law and contract is the most liberating of all constitutions.<br />Anyone who enjoys philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and social psychology will be immediately attracted to this author and this particular book. It is copiously endnoted to substantiate numerous positions taken, but the quotes are so eloquently woven into the prose that they barely stand out as &quot;quotes.&quot; As with other books by Hayek, this is very accessible to most college-level educated citizens, and even those who have a fervent interest in the subject matters without the paper to prove it.<br />This profound book is not a startling provocation, but a reasoned exposition. He nutures each subject and sentence with clarity and grace, and yet, despite his obvious erudition, he constantly engages the reader. I found that this book was one of those &quot;life-changing&quot; reads, not because of some extraordinary insight, but because of its ordinary insight. Concerns and matters that occupy our minds are addressed in an impeccible order, without being redundant nor tart nor extra-phenomenal. Rather, it's a kind of &quot;eureka&quot; one experiences when all the right and usual information is presented in the right and usual manner, but takes us one step beyond to see how this view actually comports with our most basic instincts.<br />Finally, the author addresses a very broad audience with a plethora of subjects, each taking on a coherent whole, while artfully crafted within a network that seems obvious upon reading, but less artfully crafted without it. This is a book you'll not only read with zeal, but return to often, no matter what your stripes.s obvious erudition, he constantly engages the reader.

There is simply  no other book in the English language that is more comprehensive (the  number of pages is an obvious give away) nor more helpful. As a lover of  language, I frequently examine other such books, and always find that they  come up short against this exhaustive resource. What makes this particular  reference so valuable is that it recognizes each word usually has more than  one meaning, and when it gives a synonym, it is by meaning, not simply by  word. Moreover, the reference gives various examples when a word is used as  an adjective or adverb, and either as a noun or a verb. It's this breadth  and depth that makes this particular synonym finder so extraordinarily  superior to the competition. My only lament is that it doesn't include  antonymns, but then the book would probably be too large and too  cumbersome. As it stands now, the words are clearly displayed, and the  synonyms - in all their variety - are abundant.	2000-09-12

It's not a part of the Western Canon for nothing! It's a seminal work  (autobiography) in a seminal field (Patristics)worth reading regardless of  religious orientation, including none. What makes THIS particular version  so exciting is that it is eminently readable and still quite stylized.  Chadwick's eloquent translation caputes not only Augustine's ideas and  thoughts, but equally important, his rhetorical skills. This alone  justifies the purchase of this work. The philosophical nuances that,  ironically, have entered twentieth-century thought again are very clearly  articulated in Chadwick's translation. Other translations are likely to  obfusicate what Chadwick elucidates. Read this great work by a great  translator. I am confident you'll return to it again and again (even if you  disagree with the Doctor).	2000-08-30

This is an awkward translation, brought about I believe  because the translator tried to be more cryptic than necessary, more brutal  than desirable, and more enigmatic than the story already is. For those  wanting a more accessible, readable Beowulf, I heartily recommend Kevin  Crossley-Holland's wonderful translation and introductory notes, published  by Phoebe Phillips Editions (London). Crossley-Holland's book also has the  advantages of being a well-crafted book, expansively bringing to life the  poetry of a legend from the classics of the medieval world. Finally, while  I cannot endorse Seamus Heaney's translation, at least his efforts revive  an interest in this anonymous medieval work, which deserves much wider  readership, and although not included among the &quot;great books of  western civilization&quot; canon, seems indespensible to understanding that  tradition.	2000-08-06

Adler was deemed not a professional philosopher and was thus summarily dismissed.  Moreover, he argued cogently for a return to what in philosophical parlance  is know as &quot;naive realism,&quot; but all the chic thinkers then, and  now, debunk such a world view as archaic and not very interesting. It  didn't help, perhaps, that Adler repeatedly appealed to Aristotle and  Aquinas to justify his positions - whether these sages have something to  contribute or not.<br />Now comes John Searle, a very professional philosopher  and a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of  California, Berkeley. He's written a great many books, some of which have  been standards in the field of language and psychology throughout the  world. He's Oxford trained and is widely respected. And, like Adler, he has  a few philosophical mistakes he'd like to clear up. And does so incisively  against those who attack the external world, mind, consciousness,  intentionality, society, and language with clarity, elegance, style, and  wit. Unlike Adler, he applies the Anglo-American style of analytic  philosophy, the most rigorous intellectual approach, but one doesn't need  to know logic to understand the force of his compelling arguments.<br />In  many ways, this is Searle's best book. Not because it is a detailed  examination of every philosophical nuance, but because he brutally  demythologizes idealism and all attending -isms that have no foundation, no  raison d'etre, no excuse, other than the &quot;will to power&quot; to force  _their_ reality onto others. In 161 short pages he turns many philosophical  &quot;puzzles&quot; into enigmas of someone else's making, not perplexities  we have to live with.  It's a refreshing and enjoyable read. I only hope  time will bear the fruit of Searle's views on ethics, one field in which he  has been curiously silent.usly silent.	2000-06-14

With the reductio ad absurdum of post-modernism, Kripke restores the  viability and stability of naive realism by fixing the referent in  linguistic activity. It's a brilliant move, and one that has withstood the  antagonists with suave and elegant argument. What Kripke has done is  completely undermine the whole post-modernist project, which, at its core,  attempts to deconstruct every semblance of reality. By using the very same  tools, namely language, Kripke shows how the post-modernists have failed,  and why they have.<br />Intellectual skepticism is a healthy attitude for any  critical thinker, but this very-well written argument on the necessity of  naming that establishes and stabilizes our world around us is a must for  all students of philosophy, and for all disiciplines that believe  &quot;differance&quot; makes all the difference. Kripke shows that it does  not.	2000-06-04

Unfortunately, this book is filled with arrogance -- the assumption that the Jesus of Nazareth the world has worshipped for two millennia needs to  be rediscovered. Rather than trying to conjecture what could'a been, why  not profess what is: Jesus Christ is Lord. The fact that an Anglican bishop  doesn't believe the Church's teachings in nothing new, but then to feign  naivete and claim to have found some new heuristic is just a tad too silly.  Bp. Spong has been looking in all the wrong places, and has come up with a  Jesus that wouldn't be worth most our time.	2000-05-29

This is not a commentary by some johnny-come-lately, nor a revisionist approach to Christianity. This is the best synthesis of how the early  Christians understood not only Scripture, but Christianity itself. Whether  one is Catholic or Protestant, all the doctrinal issues of the Reformation  and Counter-Reformation are moot. Here, every early Christian who reflected  on the Sacred Word has a say. What one discovers (if it weren't already  self-evident) is that Scripture itself is a pluralistic undertaking. The  idea of using Scripture as a two-edged sword is joyfully not to be found. A  plurality of meanings comes alive, all of which are viable, some more  meaningful &quot;now&quot; perhaps than &quot;later,&quot; but ever open to  further insight and understanding. Those who want a book to support their  pre-understanding will not enjoy this book or this series. Rather, those  who have come to understand that Scripture is a tool of the Church and a  gift of the Holy Spirit, ever alive and anew to each and every age, will  find nuances and ideas never thought before. It doesn't invalidate one's  predisposition; it just opens the Holy Book to the immensity within it and  outside of it. Therefore, it is for &quot;spiritual&quot; people, not for  &quot;dogmatic&quot; people. Oh, there's plenty of &quot;orthodoxy&quot; in  these pages, but the truth is seen symphonically, not as a solo instrument.  Any Christian who ever hoped that an ancient commentary and lectio divina  could come together, and haven't found it: Look no farther. This is it!	2000-05-23

To recapture what criticism meant before the novel, but useless ideas of structuralism, post-structuralism,  deconstruction, post-modernism, et alia, Matthew Arnold is about as good a  place to begin.

Arnold is like encountering hermeneutics by having  first visited Thomas Aquinas, or having studied democracy by having first  studied Hobbes. Arnold is a seminal thinker, crtic, and student of the arts  and society. He belongs in criticism's lexicon well before de Saussure,  Derrida, Lacan, at alia.	1999-09-07

This bifurcated question lies at the core of this excellent classic. The assumption that all choice is rational, that rationality choses freedom apriori, and freedom is its own intrinsic good has been the foundation of  contemporary economics and liberal political theory for more than a  century? This book challenges this and other assumptions, demonstrating  that the true human &quot;need&quot; is not for freedom in itself, but  instrumentally, so that our choices to bring about the right mixture of  stimulation in our lives is balanced by an appropriate dose of comfort. Too  much stimulation produces pain, too much comfort produces boredom, the  excess of which lies outside the &quot;mean.&quot;<br />This book goes beyond  challenging our most basic presumptions; it argues coherently, cohesively,  and cogently that the summa bonum of human life is not merely choice, but  the right choices that balance our conflicting desires for something  &quot;new&quot; with our desire for &quot;stability.&quot; Most theories  gravitate toward one extreme or the other; Scitovsky demonstrates the  Aristotlean &quot;mean.&quot;<br />Sadly, this book is only available in  hardback at and is very pricey.

The message does not flow, but spurts and starts in a  jarring manner.<br />Pieper has many salient points to make, all of which  should be used in dialogue with Veblen's &quot;Theory of the Leisure  Class.&quot; It's not that they are the same wavelength, but the  differences are telling all the same.<br />This isn't a book I'd buy (but I  did), but get through a library. It's not a book florid with gems of  wisdom.	1999-06-02

Deconstruction is simply untenable, and Ellis simply elucidates this. His arguments are clear, concise, and  often redundant, but then this is the obverse of deconstruction, so it may  need repeating. There are other challenges to deconstruction that Ellis  does not make, challenges more in line with the philosophy of language and  mind (e.g., Kripke, Searle, Ryle, et alia) that are more decisive, but also  more complex. This simple tome, however, has enough to get one started, and  if the deconstruction bug is still not eradicated, there are other  compelling arguments elsewhere to bolster some of the gaps.	1999-03-28

This key text is supplemented with numerous boxes for caveats, and  punctuated with plenteous graphs to explicate the material presented.  Sometimes, the technical information gets short-shrift, and many of the  statements already belie the book's age. Even so, no investor should  proceed with confidence until this book is thoroughly read, digested, and  implemented.	1999-03-27
