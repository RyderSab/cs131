As one reviewer said \\"The entire work has no beginning nor end. It is one long drawn-out middle.\\" It just wallows around- an incoherent word jumble. If there is a story line I really couldn't find it. <br /> <br />Aside from the dreadful editing job (if anyone actually edited it), a 12 year old child could not possibly have written the narrative. All in all, the whole thing is just too affected, precious and twee for words. Besides the chronological errors, misspelled words, etc. Just plain bad. Of course, I find the Richard Jury books to be much the same. <br /> <br />Save both your money and time. Don't bother.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-15
US	49493269	R2NYU5TNCY27H2	1597220043	142764139	Dead as a Doornail	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent!	I have read all the books in this series and loved every one. I particularly like the way the character of Sookie Stackhouse matures and becomes increasingly self confident and self reliant in each book. And the books get better with each one. I don't need sex scenes in a book to enjoy it, and quite frankly, that's one reason I only read about 20 pages of one Anita Blake book-then never read another. That particular series is an insult to intelligence. I read for enjoyable characterizations, wit, and charm. <br /> <br />Of all the things Ms. Harris does well, one of the best is her ability to evoke the character of a small Southern town and its inhabitants (\\"Grabbit Kwik\\", \\"Descendents of the Glorious Dead\\", the pharmacy that is also a card shop and a UPS drop off, etc). She has a wonderful, slightly sardonic sense of humour and is investing Sookie with the same quality-I love it! <br /> <br />I grew up in a small Southern town where my family has lived for 300 years-Ms. Harris captures the flavour of a town and its citizens incredibly well, and this, I think, is what makes her books so wonderful...	2005-09-03

The entire thing-the plot, the characters and yes, the historical accuracy, are very tired.  Frankly, I quit reading about half way (no mystery introduced and I was tired of wading through labored prose) and just glanced at the ending, which was pretty silly and far fetched.	2005-02-05
US	49493269	RE38GW7IEU6H6	0312997701	641031887	Earth Colors	Books	2	5	9	N	N	Very negative	This is not a good book. I also am a woman geologist (hydrogeologist)and I am increasingly offended by the whiny, bitter, unsympathetic portrayal of a prototagonist (if that word can be used)who seems unable to pull herself together enough to finish a degree and get and hold a job. Besides these twin destroyers, Em also has unending relationship problems with the men in her life. <br /> <br />Finally, the basic premise is silly. Since other reviewers have outlined the plot, I'll just say that the idea that someone would get a totally unqualified geologist (as opposed to, say, an art historian, curator, or someone else who deals with art for a living)to authenticate a painting is rediculous.  <br /> <br />I found this to be a very negative,pessimistic book. Such a contrast to \\"Bone Hunter\\", which is a delight to read.	2004-12-08

What a mistake. I am not amused by either junior high humour or violence against women. I found this to be a dreadul book with a sophomoric plot and a degrading, violent, abusive view of women. I did not finish it and will never read another book by this author. I stongly suggest no one else do so, either.	2003-07-21

I just can't keep up with who all these many, many characters are and how they interact with whom. As a result, I have found the best way to read these books-just pick a story line (I picked Stronghand and the Eika) and skip everything except text pertaining to that storyline. Otherwise, the plot (if there is a central one, which I doubt)just sprawls and spreads, much like a coffee stain on a paper towel. In fact, I would have given this book (and the series) one star if it weren't for the originality of the Eika. Ms. Elliott deserves two stars for that.	2003-07-01

I have to admit, I read only the first 50 pages or so, then skimmed it to see how it ended. Predictably. I love Ms. Rowland's attention to detail and portrayal of life in 17th century Japan, but I have problems accepting characters acting totally out of the cultural norm of the times. The plot itself is silly and the character Reiko increasingly has  become a contemptorary action figure with Nancy Drew overtones. If I really enjoyed Xena, I'd watch reruns on TV.	2003-06-23

Ms. Weir embarks on a mission to \\"prove\\" Mary innocent of Darnley's death. I don't think anyone has ever suggested that she physically took part in the crime, but Ms Weir fails to make the case that she lacked complicity in the affair. I simply do not believe that Mary, brought up in the dissolute court of Henry II of France, was as naive as Ms Weir implies. Furthermore, Mary's later passion for, and complicity in, an extensive series of failed plots against Elizabeth of England belies this stand. The guilt or innocence of the Darnley plot rests-as it always seems to- on the evidence provided by the Casket Letters. About halfway through this discussion is where I gave up. Ms. Weir makes a case here, but neither convinces nor provides new interpretations of old, existing evidence. Finally, I have enjoyed tremendously every other one of Ms. Weir's Tudor biographies- she should stick with those rather than attempt a \\"scholarly\\" defense.	2003-06-10

I have read Mr. West's qualifications and indeed, he is a very qualified and very literate author. However, this is a  bizarrely awful book. Maybe something happens in it and maybe there's a plot somewhere, but I couldn't find it. It reminded me of one of those stream of consciousness books (a style I detest)crossed with some strange form of science fiction. It just didn't make any sense. I couldn't finish it-just read about 50 pages in the beginning &amp; skimmed a few in the middle and at the end. This was a library copy, so I had no fiscal outlay and am very glad of that. I gave it two stars because of Mr West's knowledge of the period and obvious literacy (otherwise, a negative if there was one), but don't waste your time.	2003-06-02

That said, I am an enormous fan of Paul Doherty, but not of this particular series. His more recent series with Alexander is far, far better. There are just too many historical inaccuracies and too much license taken with actual historical facts. Miriam (the detective) is a dreary, drab, unbelievable little squab of a character (Jews at the court of Philip? Female at that? I doubt it!!).<br />However, Paul Doherty is a wonderful writer and I would give everything else I have read by him a 4.5 or 5.	2003-04-10

Ms. George does, however, succeed in portraying Henry VIII-one of the most fascinating men to ever live-as a one dimensional soap opera figure.

The series started out splendidly, but the modernization of the characters (particularly the Nancy Drewization of Bener) leaves a great deal to be desired. The reason I read historical mysteries is to immerse myself in a culture that is as alien to contemporary life as any Star Trek episode. I also would give it a 3.5 were that possible-it's better than a 3, but doesn't deserve a 4. Ms. Robinson, please return to the cultural norms of 1300 B.C!!	2002-10-29

The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius.	2002-09-26

JMR is impressively knowledgeable about Roman military/history and presents it in an excellent alternate history.  <br />I agree with the reviewer from Knoxville- I wish there had been a little more humanitty in the characters, but assume that will come with the succeeding books (I can't wait!!) The character Marcus Scipio reminds me of Decius (SPQR series) minus the tongue in cheek humour and the awareness of human imperfection.<br />All in all, Mr. Maddox brings to life a world dead two and a half milennia and invests the characters with so much humanity that we feel a connection to Scipio and Norbanus as well as the centurions and the \\"boys\\".<br />Excellent!!	2002-09-07
