An excellent telling of not only Rogers St. Frances raid, but of the events around it. <br /> <br />As always the fog of war is the most interesting part of the story.  Amherst got much credit for taking Ticondaroga after the first attack failed, but in fact the French had withdrawn the bulk of their forces.  Thus the place names in my area of Massachusetts. <br /> <br />The book relies on both written records and oral tradition of Indians to tell the tale.  It also does an excellent job of giving the side of the Indians without whitewashing them.  Men are much more interesting when you treat them as men, not as absolute saints or sinners. <br /> <br />Very solid book, worth your money.	2005-09-04

If you've ever heard him on the radio you will notice that the tone of the book is the same as the tone of his voice.   <br /> <br />This book explores the magical season of the sox, but doesn't focuse so much on the magic as the trial and tribulations that got the sox there.  The fact that the focus is not on the games that every sox fan has already memorized and instead on the background makes it a better book. <br /> <br />The players , the front offce are treated as people and their foibles rather than on the images.  His handling of the Nomar trade is excellent.  He rightly declares the trade the pivitol moment of the season and produces the stats to back it up. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if it is a vital addition to your Baseball or Red Sox library, but it will be a welcome one.	2005-08-21

With the exception of his \\"American Pioneer\\" list which includes such people as Jessie Jackson, Gloria Steinem and Sheldon Hackeny (who is Sheldon Hackeny?  Read on.) Goldberg doesn't go into deep details about the people on his list.    One thing that he DOES do is name many names (such as the above mentioned Hackney of Penn) that most people never heard of.  The ripples of their labors hurt us all but their names are known to only a few.    That is the biggest plus to the book, which perhaps deserves an extra half star, but I not so sure.  It as I say is more of a book of lists fun book, but frankly most of the people in here I find tiresome already so I don't need more of them, still at 30% off it was worth it for the free shpping of THE CUBE AND THE CATHEDRAL.

It was good, interesting and informative but it wasn't all consuming.  In small doses it was just the right taste. <br /> <br />The relevance of the book becomes plain as he points out that once France was defeated utterly it was the presence of the Royal Navy run by an ethical society that kept the peace.  It was when the Navy allowed itself to be rivaled (by the Germans) or restricted by treaty (in the 20's) that gave the green light for dictators to feel free to rise.

As a northerner who grew up with a bias against the south (although my ancestors came here 100 years I identify as Sicilian rather than Yankee)it was particularly good and fairly true.   <br /> <br />The Pre-US history of the people is a page turner as it establishes the culture and beliefs of the race (yes I said race) <br /> <br />The story of the people to the civil war is also great but I think he looks at Jackson with rose colored eyes concerning the American Indian.  (yes I said Indian; any person born in American is a native American)I believe Jackson looked at the American Indian as a conquered race, a worthy foe but a conquered one, thus he was willing to respect a defeated Red Stick, take in a young lad to raise but saw no compunction in ignoring their Supreme court victory.  To him they were a conquered race and had no standing.  (Marshall has made his ruling let him enforce it.) This would be more in keeping with the story he is telling.  Of course any historian who defines Jackson simply by his relationship with American Indians isn't worth his salt, they would be the type to would define Jefferson only as a slave holder.  Jackson's impact on the country past and present is huge and deserves all the attention Webb gives it. <br /> <br />The brick wall he hits is the civil war and its aftermath.  His brave and worthy ancestors followed the wrong captains, brave and leading from the front, noble, but wrong.  They followed the very people who put them down.  It didn't have to be so.  Every southern state except South Carolina provided regiments to the Union and the Great Captains who led the Union to victory were just as worthy (and just as Scots-Irish!).  The attempt to divorce slavery from the war is as laughable as the modern liberal attempt to divorce the war on terror from Iraq.  His pooh poohing of the Emancipation Proclamation forgets Lincoln primary reason for fighting the war UNION.  Of course the people understood what it would mean in the end. <br /> <br />On reconstruction he makes some good points but neglects the fact that of COURSE the North owned everything.  The South spent its wealth on its cause and was devastated.  How could the north NOT own everything?  He is correct about the manipulation and revenge but after a war so bloody it was inevitable particularly with a conquered foe that didn't believe itself conquered!  He is correct about the mistakes but I don't see how it could have turned out any other way. <br /> <br />Once the war is past the book grows stronger again, WWI & WWII and the FDR sections are great.  He seems to miss that his Grandfather was the perfection of the Scots-Irishman.  He was loyal to the great captains but was unwilling to follow what he knew was wrong and paid the price for it.  He was the definition of a great Captain and it speaks poorly of his fellows that they didn't follow. <br /> <br />His final chapters are excellent history and commentary on America.  I conclude that the descendents of those would have manipulated his ancestors are the elites desperately clutching power, but being thwarted by the independent clans (united by the internet).  What is ironic is that the same weakness that led to their downfall, the cliquish following of the great captain is the weakness of the left who's great captains such as Moore, Dean and Jackson are not so great or so brave. <br /> <br />His overall thesis is correct.  The Scots Irish values that have entered American culture (Values that we Sicilians already had I might add) are a great strength of America and we as Americans are blessed to have it and obliged to understand it.  Thanks to Mr. Webb's book, we can. <br />	2005-01-22

I was less excited after reading it.  Although it contained a lot of good information I considered it uneven.  It is a question of the thesis of the book, that America's relationship with France is disastrous, I would say it has been: for French prestige that is. <br /> <br />Now if the thesis was solely:  \\"It is a myth that the relationship with France is based upon friendship and that the idea of France is an ally of America is false.\\"  Then this book would be quite correct. However, much like Hitchens' book THE TRIAL OF HENRY KISSINGER it delivers the minor message while not proving the major one. <br /> <br />Early on the book it points to the French use of Indians in attacks on settlements.  It is true that the American Indian in war was a savage and ruthless foe but the same encouragement and aid for those attacks were by the British during and after the American Revolution.  This was not a uniquely \\"Gallic\\" form of war. <br /> <br />From there it tells of the weakness of the French republics, the horror of the French Terror, the barbarity of the revolutions that followed, and the dishonorable methods used from the XYZ affair to Napoleon III and beyond.  It's accurate, some might be new to people who don't know French history and it is good reading. <br /> <br />The book's failure is showing how this was directed at America in particular.  From what I read and saw the French used these methods with ALL the nations they dealt with (and still do).  If you follow the thread from Deerfield to Iraq what you find is France promoting its own overriding desire for international relevance without regard for anything else.  It is a tale of nationalistic narcissism.  <br /> <br />This book makes a VERY solid case that over hundreds of years France has reached the point where nationalistic narcissism eclipses the goal of French survival (read Islamic fundamentalism) but that's not what the book is supposed to be about.<br /> <br />On the other hand consider this:  France's wars in the New World led to British settlement west of the Appalachians, hardened Americans for the coming war with England (James Webb might say they were hardened already but that's my next review.) <br />and led to American independence.  The XYZ wars led to American privateering on a grand scale while being a training ground for such American heroes as Bainbridge foreshadowing 1812.  Napoleon's maneuverings kept the British too busy to check our westward expansion, led to the Louisiana Purchase and incredible British defeats in the North by Perry and MacDonough and by Jackson in the south.  Her maneuvers in the Civil war did little to help the south, while her retreat in Mexico strengthened the North.  Her dependence on the US in WWI made us stronger and her defeat in WWII made us the greatest power in the world where we remain.  The amazing thing isn't France's nationalistic-narcissism.  It is the left's decision to buy into it! <br /> <br />The conclusion is clear: France's nationalistic narcissism is hazardous to its health and ours.  This is the true story of the book and it is told well.  A better title would be \\"Our impotent rival the story of France's disastrous rivalry with America.\\"	2005-01-13

It is very interesting to see her trying to make ends particularly with a drinking husband blowing her dough.   <br /> <br />Once of her strengths was the fact that she saw herself as a worker and not in the way that celebs today see themself.  Looking at things in that light a lot of the book makes plenty of sense. <br /> <br />I was bothered by her words about Che who frankly was a murderous bastard.  I suspect his Irish grandmother and the fact that being Irish she knew  of the violence of revolution and either was unaware of this history or excused it at the time because of the Irish violence that was glorified to some degree in her youth.  Of course one tends to give people they know a pass and I think that is what she did here. <br /> <br />A very worthwhile book, an easy read.	2005-01-09

You mean people fall for this book?	A friend who converted from Roman Catholicsm gave me this book hoping to help \\"save\\" me from the church I left.  <br /> <br />  I was visiting his house and read the first chapter while there.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  I have since been re-reading each chapter and sending him rebuttals. <br /> <br />  The author seems to wish to subsitiute the infallibility of the Pope with the infalibility of his own interpetation of scripture, and from the text many weak Catholics are falling for it.  He talks of Satan's plan to use the Church yet his misses Satan's actual plan, I quote from my rebuttal to Chapt 4: <br /> <br />\\"The basic plan is simple:  First divide the church, (the initial reformation) then divide the dividers.  This is why there are thousands of different denominations. They are copies of copies of copies each one losing a bit of the truth along the way.  Think of it this way:  Luther said in the initial break that there are only two sacraments (Baptism & Communion), Your denomination only recognizes Baptism although it may not call it a sacrament.  The Jehovah's Witnesses don't recognize the divinity of Christ and so it goes.  This is how some protestant churches have reached the point where married gay clergy is a point of discussion instead of a settled known sin.\\" <br /> <br />C.S. Lewis warned of this:  <br /> <br />\\"You will say that these are very small sins...remember, the only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy. It does not matter how small the sins are, provided that their cumulative effect is to edge the man away from the Light and out into the Nothing.\\" (screwtape letters chapt 12) <br /> <br />Maybe Mr. McCarthy doesn't understand what he is doing when he attacks the Church but he sure isn't going to convert any but the very ignorant or very guilt ridden looking to blame the church for their sins.

The fact that a book like Michelle Malkin's IN DEFENSE OF INTERNMENT even has to be written is a great example of the loss of collective memory that is common in a democratic society. <br /> <br />As many people have ignored or forgotten the attacks of 9/11 and what we believed afterwards so has an entire society re-written history to forget what the situation and the stakes were during World War II after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br />Malkin cures us of this loss by going through MAGIC and relevant events to first show that the internment could easily be justified by the situation on the ground, she then segues into the present showing how our historical re-write done for reasons of political correctness puts the nation at risk. <br /> <br />Unfortunately instead of debating the ideas Ms. Malkin has been blasted as a racist bigot.  I recall on a call in appearance one caller (myself) who actually read the book and had a question concerning it. <br /> <br />The suppression and re-writing of history used to be a cause that liberals such as I once considered myself would scream loudly against as it usually done by totalitarian societies.  Unfortunately it is now a standard tactic of the left as the response to this book shows. <br /> <br />Malkin supports her thesis by so much documentation that it seems to burry the book itself.  I would have preferred more argument and a larger book but I'm not the publisher. <br /> <br />An excellent counter to the arguments made against, hopefully it will start a civil debate on an issue vital to the survival of the country.	2004-10-11

Every indication shows every interview shows people doing what was needed to survive.  Its kind of sad to read of people debasing themselves to get by. <br /> <br />The war itself was even more unreal, I can't consider what goes through the author's mind while listening to the drivel he is told by the people in charge. <br /> <br />The most interesting part is the post war bit and the Iraqi character.  There are two things here to consider: <br /> <br />1.  Iraqi's had spent decades adapting themselves to live under Saddam.  Many actually were able to live quite well.  They knew what was expected and acted accordingly.  When that was gone many just couldn't cope.  Instead of death coming from one known source, it could come from many at any time.  This will be a real test of the character of Iraq and its ability to become a free society. <br /> <br />2.  As a person of Siclian origin I recognize the way these people think.  It is like thinking of the Mafia.  You fear it as it can kill you, you respect it because their way of thinking is how you are taught, and even admire it because it is a power that is from your own race, it is that combination that kept and keeps many from \\"rating\\" out the mob.  This is the same thing that keeps many people from helping us in Iraq.  It is a love/hate relationship. <br /> <br />  As the attackers concentrate on their fellow Iraqis (such as today's murder of children) this might change, it is one of the reasons why the mob doesn't tend to strike in its own neighborhoods. <br /> <br />A fine read	2004-09-30

My opinion has not changed, the all or nothing reviews of this book seem to support that idea. <br /> <br />Unlike Mr. Wilson's book this one will likely have merit long after this election since frankly I believe the book; and more importantly Mr. Kerry's (and the media's including Amazon's) reaction to it has made the difference in the election.   <br /> <br />The idea that Mr. Kerry was not prepared to defend himself and used tactics that said, \\"go away\\" instead of \\"bring it on\\" said more about the candidate and his judgment than a book about events from 30 years ago. <br /> <br />A few items in the book such as Christmas in Cambodia have stuck, however, I always believed that when one attempts to challenge what was already accepted for years the burden (see NOT OUT OF AFRICA) must be on those attempting the re-write.  Although I support President Bush I think if there is a doubt on some of these issues we must give Mr. Kerry the benefit of it. <br /> <br />Because of the impact of this book it will be worth owning as one of the most important events of the election of 2004.  I would suggest people more interested in history than in the election itself to check it out in December when passions have cooled. <br /> <br />Finally I think Amazon's policy is stated wrong.  If the argument was due to the volume of responses it would not be cost effective to cover this under its normal terms I think people could have accepted it.  Unfortunately using the argument made a double standard is created.  I think said double standard concerning this book vs. other election year tomes is a disgrace.	2004-09-05

The UN objected saying it did not give the OK for the US to take these materials out of Iraq.<br />-----------------------<br />The lesson here is not so much about this book and its author's veracity.  The lesson instead would be to wait for events and history to confirm stuff like this before running out and buying a partisan book in an election year.

It is a story of rising above one's place in the world, above one's prejudices and finally above one's political affiliation to get where he needs to be.<br />The story itself however is more compelling than the message that the party has basically become a secular religion.  This in itself is not surprising as the shared moral values of the country for right or wrong disappeared when the shared source of said morals was removed from secular society in the late 50's and early 60's.<br />His epiphany that the Democratic Party no longer stands for what it once was is only shocking in its lateness.  This is something that I discovered back in '92 (leaving the party at that time) but he can be forgiven for the tardiness of this discovery since he has been high in the ranks for so long that he missed the forest from the trees.<br />I don't think this is a timeless book it is relevant now but will likely not stand the test of time.  I would recommend it only as a story of Miller's life	2004-06-30

It presents that life superimposed on a series of values and beliefs that steered him.  <br />Peggy Noonan's Ronald Reagan could not do other than what he did because his character and his religion compelled him into the directions he took.  One can debate if they were the correct directions but that is in my opinion a correct statement.<br />The book is a tad messanic.  I would subimt that the author does not just write that President Reagan believed God spared him and pushed him into the direction he went, I must conclude that he believes this to be the case herself.  The author is a practicing Catholic and such a belief is not so odd for such a person but it is quite a contention to make in the year 2004.<br />In terms of her God thesis I haven't made up my mind yet on it but having lived in the cold war era, the fall of the Soviet Union seemed quite miracle to me.  No less than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in a June 7th 2004 statement referred to the late President as a man of Greatness and who am I to argue with him.<br />Buy the book	2004-06-21

The introduction of Inazuma and the story of Noodles are the high point of this book.  The introduction of priest Sanshobo will also lead to important tales in the future.<br />That being said there is nothing particular to distinguish this volume from the others that jumps out at you.  This was a transitional period in the comic and the stories reflect it, but it is the reason why I call it standard quality fare.  The quality is high but that is the standard I have expected and recieved from Mr. Sakai for decades.<br />However this fare is deceptive as this will set up the Grasscutter stories to follow.<br />Buy it.	2004-05-27

Unlike the first volue Frank Schaeffer's FAITH OF OUR SONS is about the people who wait with baited breath for news of their loved ones who are doing the dirty, but necessary work in this war.<br />It is an excellent volume and a statement on our times.  The anxiety felt by the Schaeffer family is the same as millions of Americans have felt over the 228 years of our history (and before).  <br />What differs is the curse and blessing of the modern world.  Instant news leads to instant worry, E-mail and cell phones lead to instant relief and support via the e-mails shared between the families of those who wait.<br />What also differs is the disconnect of most of us have from this situation.  Mr. Schaeffer in unable to hide his contempt for those who are indifferent to the freedom that his son helps provide and their distruct of the military.  This contempt seems to be driven at himself for sharing that view at one time and it amplifies his anger.<br />This adds passion to the book although if like me you never served you might get the feeling you've let someone else do work that was yours.  It's not a good feeling but it is healthy.<br />Required reading.	2004-05-27

A concise review of the left's history of apology for, support of, or just plain ignoring tyrniry during the Cold War.<br />For anyone who was a news junkie as a youth (particularly one who was a Scoop Jackson Dem like myself at the time) Nothing in this book will be much of a surprise.  I remember it all and stand amazed as people talk about what they said in the past as if there was no such thing as video tape.<br />I would suggest that is was this very willingness to excuse evil and unwillingness to admit that perhaps the willingness to trust the USSR over US was wrong that resulted in may people like myself going to the other side politically.  Charen writes a readible book which should be added to every library, particularly to places like the Holocost Musuem to show how &quot;never again&quot; can have caviats if one is not carefull.<br />Buy and read:<br />By an odd coincidence today on C-SPAN there was a call in question asking &quot;Is America the greatest country in the world.&quot;  Much to my delight both people on the left and right call in to say yes and for many of the same reasons.<br />Perhaps there is hope for my old party after all.	2004-05-21

Pitt /Duquesne and its use in the French and Indian war.<br />Using written reports from both side and a familarity with the ground O'Meara does a fine job making a vivid picture of the English, French and the Indians (yes I said Indians) in between.   You see all three sides in this quest for the control of the waterways vying for position and when possible using each other.<br />This book was written in the mid 60's and the total lack of political correctness shows to the joy of the reader.  It is a pleasure to see an author willing to call the roasting alive of a prisoner what it was , savage!  That this is a parallel to some reporting of events to day make it even more relevent.<br />One final note.  The truth of the Fog of war is illustrated as both side seemed to have no true idea of what they were facing and were released from their ignorance only when events or luck overtook them.  This is a truth of war that never ends.<br />Very much worth adding to your home library.	2004-05-10

The USS Essex travels to the South sea's to raid the distant whaling grounds of England during the war of 1812.  The book covers the situation leading to the decision, the trip around the horn, the dealings with the various governments there and the natives and its eventual end in battle.<br />The best parts of the tale are the dealing with south sea natives, they tell an unknown story about diplomacy and force in an unfamilar culture some of who's lessions are useful today.<br />The story suffers from the decision to cut off the story after the final battle not giving more conclusion of the characters in play except for the ESSEX itself.<br />For those unfamilar with the tale it will be a good read, for all other the account is passable.	2004-05-05

The world of a young man going through the training that makes a US Marine a US Marine and his father trying to make sense of the new world that has been in front of his face all of his life but unnoticed on his part.<br />In terms of interest John's story is of more interest since it is a world I don't know, we see how a marine is made and how he copes with all that is expected of him.  The great revelation is the purpose for all of the many things demanded of him that seem useless but have a purpose (such as shouting since a battlefield is a world of loud noise etc...)<br />I regret to say I most related to the father Frank's story.  I never served (although my father did in the 2nd World War)  Reading his story filled me with sympathy and respect for him and contempt for two :  The first being all those who treated his son's decistion as an error at best or a betrayal at worst.  The second batch of contempt however was reserved for me.  I didn't serve and am now past the age.  I look at what Frank's son is doing and find myself questioning why he is doing my job.  Its a not pleasant mirror and puts one own life in sharp relief, making one's own problems seem small and unimportant.<br />This book was finished on Sept 10 2001.

At the time I had never heard of Chris Hitchens and doubted his motives.  <br />I now am very familar with him and his opinions and looking at this book a 2nd time come to the following conclusions:<br />Hitchens has as always written an honest book as in my review of many years past I don't dispute the facts he details<br />Hitchens is not convinced of a vast Vatican conspericy as I thought he is instead the classic anti-theist.  He has no use for religion and his conclusions of Mother Teresa stem from that.<br />The Basic arguement of the book is Mother Teresa is no saint because she is more interested in Catholic doctrine and belief then the care of the poor and furthermore put those doctrines ahead of her mission.  He is quite correct.<br />However he forgets that #1  without that belief none of the good done by her and the sisters would have been done, and #2.  As a believing and devout Catholic if she put the work ahead of her belief then she would be sinning.  This is not only biblical (He who loves mother or Father more than me is not worthy of me) but best addressed in Lewis's SCREWTAPE LETTERS #23 &quot;...we do want and want very much to make men treat Christianity as a means...a means to anything --even to social justice...the Enemy (God) will not be used as a convenience.&quot;<br />Much like his view of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ the idea that the worship or belief in Christ as the primary cause for an action makes it less whole.  If you believe religion is a waste of time then you will agree with both views.  If you are a believer in Christ you will not.<br />Either way the book is worth reading.  If only for the fact is is the only contrary view of Mother out there and is a more honest view than any other critic would give.	2004-03-11

Bush on War, Terrorism and Freedom: Foreword by Peggy Noonan; Introduction by Jay Nordlinger A National Review Book	Books	4	8	14	N	N	Information and affermation for both sides of the debate	You wouldn't think a book of speeches many before small groups would elicit the gushing or the venom that this book seems to make. <br />Forgetting the into by Nordlinger which is great, this is a book of speeches some historic (Jan 20th 1991, 2 STOR address etc..)  Some in fact most not.  As such a reference alone this book is worth your money no matter what side you are on in the debate since it gives the argument that was made for both Iraq and Afghanistan not to mention the patriot act et al.<br />In terms of the content both side have some meat here, The left can rightly say that WMD was a big argument for Iraq and the president stress it in every speech, his supports can rightly say that he also stress the previous UN resolutions and that the stockpiles listed by the UN are not accounted for.<br />There are however two spots where the president's detractors fare poorly.  Since most of these speeches were not given on the air the argument that they were given poorly rings false.  (The argument that the speeches are poorly written is a legit one although I would disagree with it myself) More importantly it give rest to the oft-repeated canard that we &quot;rushed&quot; to war.  Many speeches made over many months show otherwise.<br />For myself the key line is from the Sept 20th 2001 speech where it is stated that the country may forget but he will not.  Rightly or wrongly the war is the #1 priority for this president and this book and his actions show that he will not be distracted from it.  That alone to me make it worthwhile for supporters of the president.<br />Taking the speeches in the book and arguing that they are incorrect is very valid and frankly would be a healthy national discussion; on that basis I would recommend it those opposed.	2004-02-18

It explains how people views the story over time.  It critques the eyewitness accounts and the diaries and some people selective reading of both.<br />It shows how a Disney movie reminded the whole US of the battle, it shows how an American Icon told the story , it tells the story of JFK trying to avoid a crowd asking a D(aughter of the  R(epublic of) T(exas)where the back exit was and was told &quot;Senator,&quot; she returned, &quot;there are no back doors at the Alamo.

It is an easier read, almost as if he relieved himself of a burden in the first book and can now spill at will with confort in the 2nd.  <br />In truth the fact that I have yet to see a review of this book on a major TV network excluding FOX tends to confirm the author's point.<br />It is however an inferior book to BIAS in the sense that BIAS was a groundbreaking book and this one simply builds on it.<br />Again specific examples in this book make the author's point to the degree that belies the foolhardy way that some have tried to turn the worm on media Bias in general.<br />It is worthwhile as a follow up, but frankly I think the point is made and the franchise is done for now.  The only one left to write would be the specific refutation of the books on the other side.<br />In conclusion this book has a point to make and makes it.

It is a cold and calculating look at the world of Terror and the alternatives to defeat it.<br />It is not an optimistic book but it is not meant to be.  It is a frank discussion on a subject that deserves all the solemnity and sober thinking that we can muster.<br />Other than the above-mentioned cheep shot at the WSJ I dispute only one thing in the book:<br />Dershowitz brings up the mass internment of Japanese citizens (like many other authors he doesn't mention the internment of Italians and Germans that took place on a smaller scale but that's not my beef.) during World War II.  He then declares it a failure citing FBI records that there was not a case of espionage or sabotage by an American resident of Japanese ancestry during the war.  Without making a moral judgment about the internment, this sounds a lot like people saying that &quot;Crime is down so why are the prisons full?&quot;  <br />To quote that famous philosopher Ape from George of the Jungle:  &quot; DUH!&quot;<br />Other than that, a worthwhile book, particularly if you want to start a discussion.	2003-10-28

John Quincy Adams is one of my heroes.  I eagerly  grabbed this book but almost didn't finish it.  The strong later chapters which effectively describe the Adams election, administration and later time in congress are paid for by a load of psycoanalisys of Abagail Adams, John Quincy to the point where the reader just wants to say ENOUGH!<br />When the writer calls Adams is a poor father and follows it up with a description of him informing his sons they should work hard, avoid drinking, and  follow religion I must conclude that he doesn't want me raising children either.  When he lambasts Adams for wanting to raise his sone the way he was raised saying that he should know better, he ignores that the method used produced one of the greatest statemen in the history of this country.<br />Later on it gets better the author rightly hits Adams as a poor pol but extols the virtues of his honesty and single minded devotion to what he believed was right.  His chapters on Adams vision and his fight against the gag rule are great reading as are  all chapters from the point that Adams serves in the Monroe administration.<br />The author's bias' are plain and the lens that he sees Adams life is apparent to any reader, but that lens can't cloud the life of the man, it can only make reading this story an annoyance for a time.<br />I suggest going right to 1816 and reading from there.  The book is worth reading but it was enough to convince me that I would avoid this author in the future.	2003-10-20

Be warned, this book was written in 1958 so if you are a &quot;word watcher&quot; who looks for words to be offended then avoid this book because the Indians are routinely referred to as savages.<br />If however you are interested in a pretty balanced account of a forgotten but importent event in early colonial history then find this book either in a used bookstore, a library or anywhere else.<br />Leach is before his time when he hits both those would turn their pilgrem ancestors into supermen and those who view the indian as &quot;the noble savage&quot; by going into detail as to what provoked this war, how it was fought and what the result of the actions were.<br />He give a fair amount of time to the action behind the battle instead of simply giving a blow by blow account.  He examines both the misunderstands and the inevitability of the conflict.  He credits the changes in tactics by the New England men and particularly their use of &quot;Praying Indians&quot; as the decisive turn in their fortunes.<br />Douglas makes no secret of which side he cheers for, and which sides victory better served the future, but this takes little or nothing from the book or the story which is itself such a tale that it is a wonder it is avoided and unremembered.<br />It does not deserve to be.

To a person who has never heard of the Clintons it will be almost unbelieveable.  (At least in two decades I hope that a president acting in the way would be unbelieveable.)<br />However with the Clintons still hovering all I feel is exaustion.    We don't expect any better from them.  Barbara's tome describing the pardons, the gifts the book advance and the dodging of this stuff just can't get out of the box.  We know who and what these people are, of COURSE they acted this way.  I've seen it for 10 years and just want them to go away.<br />Only they won't go away.  It is WHAT ABOUT BOB without Bill Murray's good qualities.  Reading about this years later just leaves me tired.<br />Unlike Chris Hitchens who's words are so passionate and his insights so unique that I kept reading, Barbara just can't generate the STORY. It is just another book detailing what we already know.

You might disagree with his premise (The Missionary Position) or you might think he doesn't have enough evidence to support his final conclusion  (The Trial of Henry Kissinger) but no honest reader can state that he does not come to these conclusions honestly and based on facts and his conclusions from them.<br />This book was his first step away from the left but as he would say in it, the left stepped away from its principles by supporting Clinton who used and abused those values which Hitchens believes in.<br />Reading this book years after all the hullabaloo has died down gives a great insight into the operation of the Clintons now and the position of Hitchens now.  His basic theme is that Clinton husband and wife were both giving lip service to the left while giving actions to the right based on their own advancement.<br />He asks the question out loud stating bluntly why does the right hate Clinton so since he advanced so much of the agenda.  I think it is precisely for the same reason why he did.  He correctly points out that those in power on the right lets many things go due to either political fear or advantage, it is quite similar to the California situation today.<br />As always the book is short and interesting. Don't read it at bedtime.  It is not long enough to convince you to put it down till tomorrow yet too full to finish quickly and absorb it all.<br />Read it before you read the other defenses and attacks on the Clintons.

In this text Jefferson is the &quot;Neocon&quot; saying war is the way while Adams is saying that we need to bring the people on board first (while agreeing to with Jefferson's arguement that such a war vs tribute is just)<br />We once again see a Europe appeasing and paying off terror and the US following suit until the start of Jefferson's term.<BR>Unlike other volumes that focus either exclusively on Preble's time in command, or the Eaton expedition this covers the whole story (not leaving out the boring bits although his telling of them is not boring at all.)<br />A personal piccadello for me however is at the end he tells the story of United States vs Macadonian with some detail while passing over Constitution vs Guererre.  This is done likely due the Decator role in the story but Hull is a big part of the Eaton story and frankly deservers mention.  Of course it is a story that most readers would be familar with so it could be a question of brevity.<br />This book deserves more attention and more purchase.	2003-09-01

Too many of us are not familar with our own religion and what the actual beliefs of the church are and don't bother to find out.  As long as disinterest is shown problems will remain.<br />The church itself will survive as it always does, in fact the very fact that people within are trying to undermine it suggests a truth that Satan would like to undermine, (if it was a faith or error he would let us stew)What has to be remembered is all the greatest saints overcame adversity.  The future saints that will lead us beyond these problems will do the same.<br />This is a depressing story but the fact that it is now told publically suggests that it will have a happy ending, with God's help.	2003-07-21

There are some books that are written so well that it is a positive joy to read the text.  There are some people who have such a way of looking at the world that you feel comfort hearing them speak.  There are people who have seen so much that their opinion is something you seek.<br />All of these traits are combined in this volume that only Foote's Civil War trilogy can compare with.  The small stories that are routinely missed (such as the origin of &quot;the real McCoy) and the relevence of these ordinary people making extrodinary things happen are coupled with the tales of the extraordinary people who had their ordinary vices. (Franklin's advice to take an older mistress because they are both more discreet and more grateful) Both named and unnamed he tells their tale as it fits in the piece of this puzzle of America<br />Unlike much of history which seems to have an agenda, Cooke's masterpiece is classical, telling a story of grandur without fawning and of warts without lambasting.  It is a grand overview rather than a list of presidents, wars and laws.  He captures the essense of what is importnat.  It is as if he wished to give a consice guide to his compatriots in England of what facinates him about this land that he eventually settled as did many in his story.<br />It captures what America and Americans are very well and would be an excellent guide to any person who wants to understand us.  With so many Americans ignorant of their own history it would be an even better guide to todays college or high school students to make them understand this land of their birth and how it came to be what it is. <br />This book is 30 years old as I write this (July 4th 2003) at the time he wrote this Cooke was in his 27th year of his Letter from America Broadcast for the BBC.  When you finish this book you will find yourself wanting more.  Have no fear Mr Cooke is now in his 57th year of his broadcasts telling the story of America 15 minutes at a time continues.  Lets hope he dictates a sequel filling in these 30 years.	2003-07-05

There is very little to add to all the great and well deserved complements that this series has earned however I neglected to purchase this copy (starting at issue 13) because I have the entire  Dark Horse run.  However I happended to leaf through this issue at a local store and found to my shock that the first 8 stories were totally unknown to me.<br />They are first rate although for the first two stories the art seems uneven as if the Artist hadn't settled exactly how Ito would look.<br />The 8th story where Lone Wolf is revealed as the Shogun's former executioner is the best of the lot.  The final story is Issue #1 from the Dark Horse series.<br />Even that story has some slightly different translation in the dialoge and is worth your attention for that.<br />Whatever the reason this is the finest comic series that I have seen in my 28 years of collecting.

He pretty much manages to do that, however the story seems to lack any emotion at all.<br />This is an almost impossible task as the early life of Justice Thomas is alive with passion. The hearings against him alive with the same and the voice of his detractors and his defenders alike brim with this emotion.<br />Greenya doesn't seem to want to make a decision. He lets the participants and the record do most of the talking. His final chapter allows people involved and uninvolved make their cases however he refuses to draw any conclusions. This might be a desision made in order to be fair (and for the most part he shows respect for both sides of the story) but it makes for a less interesting book.<br />The story of Thomas' early life and the story of the Hearings went fast and read well, they had what most of the book lacked, but that was due to the drama inherant in the facts, not the writers writing.<br />I would suggest reading this volume first before reading the acolates of the right or the birckbats of the left, in that sense it is a useful book.<br />This book may deserve a better rating than I gave it. Greenya is not trying to be Bernard Cornwell but I find I just can't do better than what I have.	2002-12-21

Von Hammer is a character that can't one can't help but respect.  the stories are fine and the art is first rate.<br />We see only the first glimpse of what later issues will bring on the agony of survival and the inability to protect the young unready men thrown against the foe.<br />The origional issues are still cheep enough the you can get them for less than the price of this book, however I still favor the Hardcover which will last a lifetime of reading.<br />And that's what stories are for.	2002-12-21

I was disapointed with the last two novels (Sharpe's Trafalgar &amp; Sharpe's Prey).  I had missed Sharpe's Tiger for some reason and just picked it up and was VERY pleased.<br />The story of Sharpe as a private under Haskwell, and the Tippoo was just plain first rate reading on a par with the best of the Sharpe series.  No slow storyline, no useless characters, just action, adventure and plotting on a high note.<br />Like Sharpe we find ourselves respecting his foes and wishing a better fate for them.  This is the joy of the story.<br />In an old comic (King Conan #7) the barbarian says &quot;It is good for a man to have brave enemies so he can remember them after he has slain them.&quot;  We see that same respect from Sharpe and the British Army in this battle.

Page after page we see him using insights that the native born miss, arguements that the native born are afraid of using because of the fear of being politically incorrect, and honest evaluations of our foes, our friends and our cultural rivals.  <br />     The arguements are pretty solid and don't needs a ton of extra debate, I did notice however two things about the book that kept it from 5 starts for me:<br />#1  I read his column from eariler this year about the 10 great things about the USA.  It was apparently the condensed version of this book.  It seems that he took a lot of pages to say in book fom what that column said in just a few.  I understand that explaining Islam's view of the world takes some space but it seemed to not add enough for me.<br />#2.  I read the majority of the book right away but found myself stalling on the last 20 pages.  I'm not sure if it was because of the column I already mentioned but the book seemed to get dryer and slower as I got to the end.  The arguements were still there and valid but they didn't pull me forward toward the end.<br />   Still this book should be required reading for native born americans who just don't get how amazing this country is.  Just before coming into work today I stopped at a supermarket and for under 10 bucks picked up a cooked chicken, a loaf of sourdough bread and a two ltr bottle of soda.  To you and me that's &quot;so what?&quot;  but to the man in say Angola the concept of a full meal or  two (with MEAT) for the price of 1 1/2 hours of min wage labor, that's amazing, that's America.<br />   D'Souza sees how awesome that is , after reading this book you will too!	2002-09-29

I found my self absorbed by the book which drew me in and hooked me.  I actually found myself brought nearly to tears at the western wall (though I am not the least bit Jewish.)  As a student of history in general and of the Roman siege of Jerusalem it was a epoch shaking moment for an entire race.  I found Nassar and King Hussain situations were told with emotion and some sympathy.  The reviewers who said this book was dry were reading something else.<br />    The battle tales were interesting but the story of the diplomats jousting and both sides building to the showdown really made the book a winner.  It was HIGH NOON with the clock ticking ever closer.  (The use of a liberal amount of both Arab and Jewish  participants to both the battle and the diplomatic action really pays off here.)  It illustrates how both sides (ok all 6 sides US, USSR, Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Egypt) misread each other.  In my opinion it is impossible to read another countries mind without a deep spy.  Grant's dictum about worrying about what you are doing rather than your foe's works well here.<br />   The most significant thing in the book however is the story of the BIG LIE concerning US and British attacks.  This more than anything else shows the weakness of dictatorship in general and the arab states in particular.  Building a foundation on falsehood; false victories, false reports, false charges is necessary when you have to control your people in order to lead them.  Problems can't be addressed and situations can't be advanced while this is true, likewise troops can't be inspired when they can't believe what their commanders say for can the people be expected to sustain a war when they don't believe what is being said.  For Arabs this cycle is still being repeated today, my favorite example being Imam Muhammad al-Gameia who a few days after attending a service in NY preaching love and unity (in English) went to Egypt and said that the Jews were behind Sept 11 and Arabs were being shot in the streets in NY. (In Arabic)<br />   This to me is the great unintended lesson of this book.  ...	2002-09-22

As usual Christopher Hitchens backs up the his charges  with documents, and other items to support his claims; however as with the MISSIONARY POSITION his facts do not,in my opinion support his thesis which is as I read it:  \\"Henry Kissinger is a war criminal.\\"<br />   He certainly makes the case that Kissinger is an Amoral and Immoral so-and-so whose actions made a mockery of US principles.  He also makes the case that he has something to hide.  The paper trails which are sealed and the double speak offered are not the work of an innocent man.  I wouldn't accept that from Clinton and I sure won't take it from Kissinger.<br />   His weakest arguements in my opinion are what he leads with.  The actions circa 67-72 concerning Vietnam can be defended as products of the cold war vs the USSR.  The oppression of the current government in Vietnam and the Kimer Rouge in Cambodia are the result of our retreat, HOWEVER , If I read Hitch right he also contends that he was more interested in the political results at home over this than the results there.  <br />   His actions in Bangladesh, Cyrpus and and Timor have more meat, but to support these actions without making them happen, or even saying that he would ignore them is not a matter for the courts, it gives a black eye to all that America stands for but it does not rise to the level of war crimes.  If the case was made that he instigated these actions the case would be on more solid ground.<br />   His most fertile ground is Chile and Greece. Chile is the weaker argument.  Whatever your opinion of the Marxist government the replacing it with a dictatorship was wrong (and stupid and counter productive, the effect of marxist policies would have turned the population against him without help from us.  Only a soviet military buildup there or exporting revolution would have justified what was done.) but in the midst of the cold war the case can be made, (weakly) that a new marxist state in our hemisphere while fighting a cold (USSR) and a hot (VIETNAM) war could not stand.  I would give him a 50-50 shot on that one.  <br />   Now Greece it another matter The planned murder (never carried out)can't be justified by national security and the written statement position on his death prepared and ready for release (documents sealed) is damning. Under US law I would try and convict him on this.  Here is the ground to attack.<br />  Hitch also makes a great point, not on war crimes though in the great Timor discussion.  Kissinger saying he makes no profit on the deal when not asked implies a hand in the pie.  This is disgusting and turns my stomach.<br />    If the thesis was:  \\"On these cases Kissinger took actions that were contrary to what was right, what was moral, what was in the best interests of the US (With the exception on Vietnam) and was anathema to the moral position of the US in the world.\\"  He would be spot on, even if the arguement was basically to try him under US law it (and he does argue this weakly) is a sound one.<br />  His acutal arguement is on international grounds, more on Greece and less on elsewhere might have made his case.<br />  This book should rate 3 1/2 stars really, but the quality of the writing (even if it doesn't support the thesis) demands the 4 over the three.  It is worth reading, and I would be interested in having Mr. Kissinger answer it.	2002-09-20

His part concerning the Biblical defense of Clinton could easily apply to those defending millitant Islam today.<br />   His worry about what the death of outrage would do to our culture was unfounded the country's response to the attacks of last year proved that without a doubt and outrage and American ideals will live as long as America does.

I can't really say if its because after SO many Sharpe books and movies I'm just tired of the series or if it just wasn't written as well as it could be.

Like the two volumes before it Caro proves to be a master storyteller, which is just what you need to tell the story of a master storyteller.<br />    The authors paints a portrat of the senate and how it became the place that LBJ entered and also of the Civil Rights movement in ways that put you there and keeps you entertained and turning pages.<br />     The book revolves around the Civil rights act of 1957 and Johnson's efforts (and purpose) to pass it.  The gist of the author's arguement is twofold:<br />#1.   Without LBJ there is no passed Civil rights act of 1957.  This is an arguement that is well supported.  Caro mentions how the various liberals acting on principle failed time and again to pass such a law, becasue they were more dedicated to principle then winning they were unable to make the deals to get such a law passed.  Since LBJ as all three books never let principle stand in the way of his goals, he could succeed where they would fail.  This thesis is right on.<br />#2.   The second thesus is suspect.  It is that Johnson was an actual true believer in for civil rights.  I think this arguement can't be supported by the facts shown in this and the previous volumes.  I think the arguement instead is that LBJ was a true believer in being president and once president was a true believer in being remembered as a great president.  I don't say that he didn't understand the right and wrong of the situation.  I say he accepted the right because the took him toward the overall goal.  It is apparent to a reader of these volumes that Johnson was one of the hardest workers ever to serve in the congress, but his ultimate goal was what he was working for.<br />    If LBJ spoke honestly about his purpose, I think he would have stole these lines from Lincoln:  \\"My paramount object is to be president and not to advance or retard the cause of civil rights.  If I could be president by advancing civil rights I would.  If I could be president by retarding civil rights I would, and if I can be president by advancing some civil rights and denying others I would do that too.<br />    The only complaint I can give on the book is the hints of personal bias, (particularly pp 679 & 680) but other than that it is golden.  Can't wait for the next one.	2002-06-08

I remember this one flying off the shelves at the comic store when the issues came out.<br />We see a two new arrivals in Gotham.  One a police lieutenant with a bit of a past who finds corruption rampart in the force and a fellow officer who he falls for creating corruption in his marriage.<br />We also find a rich playboy who thinks he is ready to begin his revenge on the underworld for the lives of his parents, starting with the corrupt police force.<br />Several things in the Batman mythos are re-written.  Gordon is a thirty something cop, Selina Kyle is a hooker instead of a jewel thief, it is a darker and gritter story, more in the genre of the Japaneese style of comics for adults.  Considering the direction Miller took daredevil it is no big shock.<br />It was the second step on the road to comics no longer being something for kids.  It was a great story, and a fine plot.  The artwork was done well, the style fit the story well, but save it for when the kids hit 15.	2002-04-25

GROO (the joke is still funny after all these years) Usagi Yojimbo (a classic series of stories with a bit a humor as well.) and Lone Wolf and cub.  (I know these are reprints but the issues since 13 were never published in English so as far as I'm concerned it is new.)<br />    More interesting that the stories themselves (and they are plenty interesting) is the look at the psyche of Nippon.  Brothers of the grass is a great example.  By any modern stardard the &quot;grass&quot; have an unstable obsession, however duty overrides all, but can even these great warriors in hiding for years overcome the  Lone Wolf and his quest for revenge?

We see a Bruce Wayne who is lost without his other identity (in fact we see his villians who are lost without him as well) seemingly going along a path of self destruction.<br />  When he finds himself the world seems to at the same time.  Sort of like when people see a great problem rather than ignore it.  Once you acknowlidge something unpleasnt you are obligued to deal with it and that brings pain but also solutions.<br />  In terms of its significance it led the way toward a darker and gritter comic book world.  It has led to many great stories but all of the changes have not been worth it.  It ushered in a age of expensive comic books that I can't expose my kids to because they're not ready or shouldn't be ready for it.  The blame isn't really on Miller and Janson who did a great and origional job, it is of all of those people who tried to be Miller and Janson instead of themselves.	2002-04-18

Inside Gilligan's Island is an interesting but not spectacular book on the creation of a television phenom.  If you are a Gilligan fan it will likely be a must read.  If you are not it will be a mixed bag for you.<br />  Mr. Schwartz does a great job describing the battles to get the show made and gets the pages turning as we wonder if his series will ever be what he wants it to be.  <br />   Unfortunately as the book reaches its later chapters it is evident that he has run out of things to say.  The last three chapters are a positive chore to read. <br />   The epidsode guide is interesting and is many of the behind the scenes production stories, this likely differs greatly from the cast members stories which deal more with the actual production etc.<br />   Throughout the book however it seems that Mr. Schwartz is preaching.  Now when he put wanted to make a social point with the series he wrote it funny (such as using his own example the implicet respect for marriage see episode 68 Mr. &amp; Mrs.) and taught the lession without giving a speech, we get the speech in the book and its just dulls you away.<br />    I did like the book, I don't know if I'd like it enough to buy it again, but I like it enough to read it again.	2002-04-14

It is the story of her family and its interactions, It is the story of her desire for Revenge, and it is the story of her searching from culture to culture, from the land of my ancestors (Sicily), to Albania, to Iran for justification for the revenge she craves for the attempted murder of her father.<br />     The encounters with the various cultures was great reading, The Iranian cleric who saw a difference between a Jew born in the Holy Land, a tourist and a European who moved there in terms of their right for revenge was incredible.<br />     Her encounters with the family of the shooter and those who ordered it was riviting, particularly since they not knowing who she really was, were willing to lie to her face concerning the shooting, perhaps they were lied to as well, who knows? It was drama and a page turner.<br />     Her own family situation frankly couldn't compare.  I understand that to each person their own situation is what drives them, but I found myself rushing through that stuff to get to the other, however I don't think I could see the book working without them.  The dispute over the Greek Temple, to me was the defining moment of those encounters.  <br />      It is a very relevent book and one of the most worthwhile reads I've had.  It combines history, current events and cultural values in a way that no history book or cultural text could.  Its weaknesses are unable to push it down to three stars for me.  Read it.	2002-04-07

Cuneo paints a picture of both sincerity and theatre, psycology and paranormal.<br />   He reserves judgement while examining what is done and said, and has no qualms about attending events himself.<br />   In my opinion he shows respect for the subjects of his book and doesn't hesitate to give them a platform while turning a critical eye on the process.<br />    A fairer book from an outside observer you will not find.

Not because of what it reveals about Jessie Jackson, but because of the potential good it reveals he COULD have done but choose not to.<br />     Lets face it, the idea that Jessie is a race hustler is not a new one, the incredible detail that is given in showing it is.  Timmerman doesn't let up providing fact after fact and clubs us ruthlessy with this information.  Sometimes the club seems to blunt, but even so it does the job.<br />     I thought the book itself could have been edited better, it ended up at some points sounding like many newspaper stories strung together.<br />     Jackson deserves some credit for agreeing to be interviewed for this book, and some of his early work on the local level is shown to be quite proper and just.  Unfortunately the glammor of attention and the lure of wealth turned into a cult of personality funded at taxpayer expense.<br />     A sad book about a sad man, but a necessary read.	2002-03-31

If you want an almost totally unbiased overview of the ENTIRE election of 2000 (including the primary season) this is the definate work on the subject.  We have facts presented here IN CONTEXT, and in full.  We have some opinions given at the end, but not before the entire history of the primary season, the general election and the post election are given such a solid going over that this should be the FIRST book you read on the subject before you read the books on the left or right. <br />   Unfortunately it seems by the number of reviews and the sales rank of this volume, facts deviod of opinion don't sell.  People seem to want to affirm their own beliefs (I plead guilty on occasion) rather that deal with all the facts.  As a political junkie, and one with a great love of history.  This book feeds me and leaves me full and happy.  This is not to say that other books on the election are not worthwhile (I enjoyed Sammon's AT ANY COST, and accepted Greenfield's OH WAITER ONE ORDER OF CROW), some are some aren't but history is made of facts, and facts are what this book delivers.<br />   If you want a complete and fair picture of the 2000 election buy this book, if you want a tilt to affirm the opinion you already have on either side then I urge you to try this as an alternative.	2002-03-31

If Hastings &amp; Jenkins book was better known that wouldn't be the case.<br />  This book does a fine job covering all of the aspects of the conflict from the history of the Falklands, the diplomatic moves and the anxieties of both England and Argentina.  <br />  The accounts of the Battles and the Bravery of British troops would not shock a student of history, but might shock a person writing a history of England over the last 30 years.  The heart of what was once the Greatest Empire in the world was laid bare and this books shows that heart in the person of the brave men who fought there.<br />  The most telling moment of the book for me was the aftermath when they talked to people about what was learned.  Three things stood out.<br />   The Flyers of Argentina were basically abandon to fight one of the strongest nations in the world without proper support.  The fought and died bravely.  The lack of support by their government and the other branches of their military was disgraceful.<br />   A statement made concerning tactics and training said a mouthful.  To paraphrase:  &quot;These guys can't believe that it comes down to training and dedication.  They think there is a secret pill or buttion that makes things work if only they could be told what it was.&quot;  Training and skill made the difference here.  It is why England always had the edge.<br />  Finally the statement that it was shocking that England would actually fight.  This belief in the weakness of demorcratic countries has caused the fall of many over the last 100 years.  It is a lesson still being learned today.<br />  All of these points are brought to life in this book.  It is an engaging read and very relevent for the times.  <br />  Highly recommended.	2002-02-12

If you have read the series in order you are now treated to the biggest change in the Hornblower character since his first marriage.  What do you do with a character that has now achieved all of the primary goals of his life.  A secure financial future, the woman he loves and fame and respect.  How do you motivate such a character?<br />Forester pulls it off.  Hornblower is put in the position of the many senior officers he has served under.  Having to watch rather than giving the orders.  Having to decide who risks his life and who does not.  Even patronage as Bush is jumped up to a SOL.<br />The decisions are different and for the most part Hornblower watches others execute his plans.  Forester however keeps the tension level high.  The handling of a fleet, the delecate matters of diplomacy and a totally different front and nature of the war adds to and completes the character.<br />The social changes are not ignored as Sir Horatio Hornblower K.B.  discovers that the honors and responsibilities of his knighthood are not all they are cracked up to be.  Several valuable lessions are given here, all are interesting and entertaining.<br />Like HORNBLOWER and the ATROPS it is a change of pace, and one worth the money you will spend.	2002-02-08

I expected a lot more material in here.  It seemed to be over too quickly, and a lot of it was focused on his own personal situation.  Mind you he approached it well, (the note from Rooney was classic) but I was left feeling there was a chapter or two missing.  There was  meat here but like an expensive resturant, you paid full price but left hungry.<br />     The thing that really got my juices flowing was the expose of the &quot;lilly white&quot; news.  Our liberal friends have been so busy attacking this book because of the Bias arguement that they have missed the scandal that is in print for the first time that i've seen.<br />     The deleberate exclusion of and or editing of stories and the people due to race in just plain wrong.  That it is going on at the networks among &quot;liberals&quot; who loudly proclaim support for civil rights is an insult to black, brown and yellow America, and frankly to white America too.  Ethnic groups aren't children who need to be led and viewers are not so shallow as to not see people as people and not as something else.  To directly quote an article by critic Roger Ebert:<br /> &quot;(I quoted Chris Eyre, the Native American filmmaker, who was on a panel with me that afternoon. &quot;For 100 years,&quot; he said, &quot;American Indians have played the same roles in movies. Either savages or spiritual peoples who exist on some mystical plane. It is time to let us just simply be people.&quot;)&quot;<br />   This is the real scandal exposed by the book.  Lets face it the notion that the media is biased is like the notion that water is wet.  It is this information about RACIAL PROFILING (there is no other way to honestly describe it) in the book that is most significant and is being lost in the debate.  Liberals should be outraged by this book because it reveals overt racism being practiced in their name!	2002-01-20

For that alone it rates at least four stars.  <br />Forester however goes one better.  At a time when the traditional hero is confident, invunerable, and a rock he makes what could be considered the first of the &quot;modern heroes.&quot;  Yet this modern hero doesn't let doubt freeze him in situations.  He has the dreads and doubts but does his duty anyway.<br />This book is the father of not only the rest of the series, but of all the naval sagas that would follow and a fine series of movies for the big screen (Peck) and small (A&amp;E).  Quite a legacy.	2002-01-13

(see paperback edition highly recommended!)  It is rightly described as a prelude to greatness.<br />We see how it all began when the most inoffensive of creatures Bilbo Baggins enjoying a day of smoke rings and the ordinary life he leads is drawn by fate (or Gandalf) into a great adventure with 13 Dwarfs, Elves, Spiders, Gobblins, Eagles, and of course a dragon.  It is an adventure where he finds out more about himself than he himself knows.<br />Unlike the later volumes the songs are of a higher quality (or so I think) but that again could be because I have actually heard them sung in the old cartoon.  The story is both exciting and calm and easy.  Not even the climatic battle near the end seems to take the focus off the Hobbit.<br />The book seems to keep the calm and relaxed pace that a Hobbit likes in his life.  In my opinion it adds to rather than takes away from the telling.  Lots of time for more adventure in the next series.<br />I think the pace of the book more than anything else makes it.  It doesn't thrust itself upon you.  It seems to say; to paraphrase the words of Bilbo:  &quot;It is a fine day for smoke rings, come blow some with me.&quot;<br />It is an invitation worth taking	2002-01-10

Can Hornblower somehow with a wounded man it tow somehow escape a squad of French soldiers and their cruel officer and return to the white cliffs of Dover?<br />Since this is not the last book in the series we of course know the answer.  A book with style and class, and with Hornblower still not shaking the fears and phobias or his future which seem to forever haunt him. <br />We also see the character of Brown developed more fully as a feature of the series.  The playing off of Brown physical abilities and the class differences between him and the officers make for great reading.<br />Not to be missed.

Ship of the line was the second volume of the origonal three books of the Horatio Hornblower saga.  Nearly 70 years of being in print has done nothing to make it stale.<br />We see again all of the warts of a navy trying frantically to prepare itself to face Napoleon.  All the desprate measures taken just to equip a SOL for a voyage become clear to the reader.  Many would say that the difference in quality made it an easy task, but the reason this difference existed was a constant blockade with men and ships paying the price in broken bones and weary bodies.  Hornblower's own worries not only inform us but they make everyday duties interesting.<br />Of course we see action action action as he reaches his station in the Med wreaking havoc on the coast.  Once again Forester takes the time to inform us.  In a time when people can travel the Atlantic in hours and make it from Boston to Worcester in minutes the struggle it was simply to travel is lost on us.  It is not lost on Forester who drills it home indirectly by Hornblowers acts.<br />Without revealing the ending (which most Hornblower fans will know anyway.)  The climatic battle has all of the traits of an epic.  Hornblower is the kings man and shows it to the full in that last fight, and it is done without being overdone.<br />Another jewel in the crown for us readers.	2001-12-28

Of course Claudius was a historian in reality and also a man of his times.  Graves brings both the times and the man out for us to celebrate and enjoy.  The entire book feels like a conversation between us and Claudius and an interesting conversation it is.<br />The best character in the book of course is Livia the wife of Augustus Caesar.  She is the leader, the mover and shaker.  She is the kingmaker who determines the fate of the empire for years to come.  Chris Hitchens would call her the Kissinger of her era, or more properly as the book was written far before his time Kissinger is the Livia of his era.<br />This book has something for everyone, and should not be missed.

I considered it the best comic book adaption of anything I ever read and the passing of a decade, and a new cover for the trade paperback has done nothing to change my opinion.<br />It should be said up front that 134 pages are just not enough to give the entire book its due. If you want the actual novel then read it. This is a comic book, it is a GREAT comic book and on my list of best ever, but it is a comic book.<br />That doesn't mean avoid this this is a great adaption. The artwork is supurb, colorful, and \\"takes\\" you into the story quickly. David Wenzel does his job well. When I think of the characters in my mind. The faces I see are these drawings. And I've seen every cartoon adaption and the movie. He also did some very nice prints from this book.<br />Charles Dixon adapts the story well. This was version I read to my children when they were six and eight and it was kept by my youngest son near his bed for easy access over the last two years.<br />This will definately get your brood especially the younger members of it into the story and into reading as a consequence.<br />A great addition to any person's collection of Hobbit or Tolklen stuff.

Bill Veeck starts the book with the moment he is most fameous for, the playing of a midget in a major league baseball game.  He rightly points out that it will be what he is remembered for most.<br />That is true but it's only part of the story.  Veeck is a storyteller and a fun person.  He thinks baseball should be fun and thinks fans should have fun watching it.  His statement that fan will enjoy a 7th place team with bread and circus' more than a 7th place team without one is about as true as it gets.<br />  He demonstrates his storytelling ability over and over again.  His tales from Rogers Hornsby and his mom; (&quot;What makes you think you're smarter than your father?&quot;)  To Satchel Page and his ultimate dream; (&quot;I dream of starting a team of 9 midgets endlessly wallking, then I dream os Satchel pitching against them and striking them out endlessly,&quot;) to his added on chapter on his re-purchase of the White Sox in the mid 70's and his great love for Gene Autry; (&quot;Back in Seattle again.&quot;) keep you reading through the book.<br />There is venom here and it is directed at people and it's not painted with a happy face.  That is one of the charmes of the book.  He tells it the way he tells it.  He doesn't expect to be loved and doesn't care if he is, but he will have his say.<br />I'm sure he would be proud of his son who has done a fine job keeping the tradition going with the very fun Northern League.  He would be prouder of the smiles his book produces on the faces of baseball fans.  If you are one and even if you aren't this book will put a smile on you too.	2001-12-23

You will also find Sherman's life so boring that you will wonder why you ever wanted to know about him.<br />If you know about Sherman you will find this book slow and tedious.  With the exception of the last chapter which does a good job reflecting on how Sherman was percieved after his death the book crawls.<br />It takes some real effort to make Sherman a boring person.  Mr. Kennett takes the task and completes it with gusto.<br />It seems to me that if he changed the scope of the book a bit with more focus on particular parts of his life it might have worked.  Instead he seems determined to allocate equal chunks to events that aren't equal.  If he wanted to stress his time before the civil war, it would have worked as those parts of the book were its strength.<br />I can recommend Sherman as an interesting person, maybe as the General who should be commanding our current war.  Mr. Kennett seems to take a moderate course, he can't make up his mind what kind of man or general Sherman is.  This moderate course is unworthy of his subject.  It's as if the book has no thesis.  <br />If there was ever a book to get at the library instead, this is it.	2001-12-17

The storytelling is fantastic and the artwork first rate.<br />The second story in the segment WAS available in regular comic book form.  I suspect there may have been some change in order in printing.  If you like me thought the series was totally published in order, it may force you to check out some eariler issues to make sure you missed nothing.<br />As for the tears, they involve the last story.  It deals with an encounter with a group of Japanese Christians who were hunted down, bounties offered on them and given the choice of denying Christ and Mary or death.  Any faithful Catholic reading this story will be moved particularly when you consider events in Indonesia and China these days.  It brings to mind the passage:  &quot;Everyone who acknowledges me before others I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.  But whoever denies me bofore others , I will deny before my heavenly Father&quot; (Mt. 10:32-33)  Of course nobody familar with the culture of Japan will be shocked since faithfulness unto death to any cause is a part of the culture.<br />Reguardless of the reason you buy it, buy it.	2001-12-17

This was one of the items I looked forward to every month.  The writing was incredible and the artwork supurb.  Out of dozens of issues I can only think a one or two that weren't worth my time.<br />When I first saw these book at the local comic store I ignored them.  After all I had all of the issues and didn't need to spend money on smaller reprints even if they were in the origional format.  However with the middle of this issue we have stories that were never published in America before.<br />It didn't hurt that one of the best stories (and the last) story of the full sized comic was here &quot;Mazohoshi Maeesho&quot;  For people who don't know the series that story will say it all.  The intro story also paints a path for those unfamilar with the series.  <br />It would frankly be a waste of verbage to describe each story.  The quality level is as always so high and the stories so interesting that there is little more to say.<br />If you never read this series start with #1 and enjoy.  If you like me didn't buy it because they were reprints then go wild.	2001-12-16

I'm not only a Hornblower fan but a history fan and a life of Hornblower written as a history seemed not only a fun idea but a great joke. (as it has been on people who have read the book and thought he was real.)  When I bought the book I found that the joke was more on me.<br />There were moments of real interest, and several minor adventures  in a summery style that wetted the appitite, but it wetted it for Forester to write about them not to continue.  Of course if the minor adventures were fleshed out in future Hornblower movies they may work well indeed!  <br />The backround info and the letters were well done and the footnotes would leave you to believe it was the real thing.  The adventures and letters of both Richard and Joshua Hornblower were actually (particularly Joshua) the best parts of the book.<br />A person now knowing the series would think this was the real thing, but I don't think he would have the desire to read the origional books, which is a shame as they are the true treasure.<br />I think that Parkinson was a big Hornblower fan who in my opinion wrote this on a lark for himself and it worked.  Hornblower fans may take exception to the letter to be opened 100 years later by Hornblower but then again maybe they won't<br />Once you've read the series you will find this book enjoyable, but don't start with it.  It's not a triumph but it is what it is if you take it as such you'll be ok.	2001-12-15

It this tome we see our hero in several different lights.<br />  We see him on a long canal boat ride and explore the great Canal network that revolutionized England in the days before rail.  It's not what we're used to but we share the marvel of Hornblower, although ours is a model of past ingenuity while his is of the present.<br />  We see him planning an elaborate event again in an error without stopwatches and radios.  We see the complexity of the event and all that must be done to make it.<br />  We see that details of refitting to a greater degree then anywhere else in the series as he gets a ship with a crew not ready and a dull first officer, the reliable Mr. Bush is of course aboard a ship which fought at Trafalgar and Mr. John Jones proves as ordinary as his name.<br />  The climax of the story takes place in Turkish waters with a dozen twists and turns to make a mission successful.<br />  This volume gives us backround of all the tasks of a captain including some of the more mundane ones.  Its a different view that any other we'll get till much later in the series when those details will not be his problem.<br />  If you demand non stop action then this volume of the series will be slow to start for you, if not then you'll like it as much as I did.	2001-12-13

Unfortunately most of the groups addressed are in decline and are not in the forfront of anti-catholic teaching that must now be addressed.  As I haven't read Keating's latest tome I can't say if he addresses the situation but for its time it must be powerful.<br />The second section is more useful but it is may be a little tough for the layman so I would suggest having the Catechism handy as you read.<br />I do confess I get so sick of hearing the tired and baseless charges of Catholic's baning the bible hundreds of years ago.  Ignoring the falseness of the charge; the idea that a member of  the protestant church whose leader Luther actually REMOVED several books to suit his own beliefs, books which were accepted for centuries makes the charge even more laughable.<br />Unfortunately it just goes to show that books of this nature will likely be needed till the 2nd coming.	2001-12-08

Perhaps because I knew the story but not the jokes.<br />Several important things I didn't know:<br />1.  The green room, the idea that even when the camera's were off the arguments continued.  That was very significant and tells how serious the matter was.<br />2.  The &quot;Fate&quot; business.  The idea that Demorcrats thought they were hit by fate is very eerie given Sept 11th.<br />3.  The reverse popular vote stratagy.  I had not read that the republicans were thinking of bringing it up.<br />4.  The former clerk for Thomas, very good point.<br />    There were several things that were missed, the telemarketer calls to Florida on election night for one, and frankly I disagree with the contention that the democrats didn't care.  I do think he was right on about republicans and the Clinton bit.  I am a registered independant but from day 2 I was convinced that given the chance Gore (meaning Clinton Gore) would steal this election.  <br />    Worth reading simply for the perspective of somebody without an axe to grind, but to my mind a tad self centered.	2001-11-29

Catholics who don't know or are wrong about their own church's beliefs and #2.  Non Catholics (both critics and supports of the church) who have a false idea of what the church teaches.  <br />As simply a reference tool this book is vital to any scholar of religion.  Judged as a reference it is well done, Very organized and easy to reference.  In addition to the standard index in the back on topics, each section concludes with a summery of basic themes of that section.  Even more useful is the very complete use of numeric margin references to other section on similar topics.  Quite useful , but if you are just reading it through resist the urge to jump to those sections or you will be jumping all over the place.  It also references many church works which are available on the internet for clarification.<br />I didn't have the page problem that other reviews have talked about and I've had two different copies of the book.<br />As an explaination of faith and duty it is complete and uncompromising, sometimes painfully uncompromising.  If you want to know what the church thinks about almost anything you will find it here.  It is not a blunt instrument but it says what it says and removes ignorance as an option.<br />Put simply if you really want to know what the church thinks vs what some people say it teaches, read this book, if you have your own agenda or don't really want to be told something is wrong (and we all sometimes feel that way) then avoid it like the plague.	2001-11-28

This first month is filled with drama, excitement and all of the enthusiam of the tens of thousands of young men who still harbored the illusion that the war would be short never expecting the stagnet ordeal and slaughter that awaited them and millions of their fellows.<br />We see England, Germany, France, Russia and tiny Belgum all struggling with the life and death decisions that ironicly we now face today nearly 90 years later.  We see the MEN who actualy made the decision and their interplay and battles with their own as well as their foes.<br />From massive assults to navel chases we are led through a month where the history of the 20th century might have been re-written many different ways.

But of all the Hornblower books this one is my favorite.  <br />  We see our hero in the most frightning challenge of his life and he fails.  He is unable to back out of a marriage that he doen't really want, but then decides that since he's doing it he will go all out.<br />   We see the newly subordinate Bush becoming even more impressed with his former junior.  Bush's ability to not object to this dramatic change is the only part of the novel that stretches credulity a bit, however since Hornblower saved his life in the last one a mittagating factor exists.<br />   We see very little ship to ship combat, (after all Hotspur is a tiny ship.) but once again Characters steal the show.  From his gentleman's gentleman that he doesn't want, to the french fishing boat captains to the various officers he encounters all make the novel richer and richer.<br />   If the new movies are done in chronological order this should be the next book adapted.  I wait with baited breath.	2001-09-13

Mr Adams and his son John Quincy have always been personal heros of mine.  Just as Amistad gave the country a look at John Quincy, Mr. McCullough give us a look at John warts and all.<br />  The warts are few.  Over and over we see a man singing the praises of virtue, frugality, honesty, in short CHARACTER!  <br />  I suspect that the success of this book has something to do with the times.  Adams (and his son and wife) are just the type of examples and heroes we need these days.  They set the example by DOING what is right and proper for the country, rather than by platitudes for public consumption (or Polls).<br />  In these times of spin (read lies and deceptions) thanks to McCullough's discovery that he and NOT Jefferson was the picture he wanted to paint, Mr. Adams and his family manage to serve their country by reminding us what we are and what we can be.<br />   The book is worthy of the praise it has recieved.  I only wish every member of congress and all those who work for BOTH political parties can read it and learn.  Unfortunately I suspect some will learn that the price of honesty and true public serivce  is a single term and no face on Rushmore.  I hope and pray that I am wrong.	2001-08-31

There have been pleanty of reviews and kudos given to this series. They are entirely deserved. As a voracious reader of history for 30 years it was just unbelieveable. Before this series I wasn't particularly interested in the Civil War. These books and Ken Burns made it interesting. The greatest challenge of a historian is how do you sell something someone isn't interested. Foote does this by making the book a conversation. Its a conversation you won't walk away from. If there is any fault to the series it is that volume 2 &amp; 3 tend to repeat certain info in the first two, (If I hear John Breckinridge Mustache compared to a Siclian Brigand one more time I'll go nuts.) this is of course unavoidable since you can't assume the people have read the previous two volumes. As far as faults go it is practically invisible, (See Breckinridge thing.) In my opinion on the subject of the Civil War there is no single item more worthy of purchase anywhere at any time.	2001-08-26

Segal's book is very informative in terms of the history of Islam and islamic culture, it becomes more inportant to the story than the actual story of slavery in Islam. At some moments he seems to be apologitic for Islams use of slaves, at other times he attacks them mostly for the sin of not following the rules of Islam. He seems to have some sympathy for the centuries old culture that held slaves as if its age excues it. Once we reach the mid 19th and 20th century that sympathy disappears. (I didn't read his first book so I wonder if that same tollerance exists to the non Islamic western culture of the same period.) It is as if he excuses the men of the past becasue of the times they live in. The actual information is interesting but he seems to over and over be interesting in portraying a sexual slavery as preferable to a working slavery and makes that judgement for the victums. It is a measured choice being made by somebody not involved but I'm sure there are many who might disagree. In terms of the info about the continuing slave trade his info is very valuable and worthy of note, I do think that the chapter on the Black Muslem movement in America didn't really fit into the book but was worth reading. As a collection on the Islamic slave trade that continues to this day it is a book that should be noticed. The violence and evil that fostered the trade and the low value put on human life was shown (although the traders seem to be the main villians here rather than the slave holder, until you get to the 20th century.) I didn't care for the slants, and frankly the book seemed less about slavery as with the culture that fostered it. I think this book couldn't decide where it wanted to go and that tug made it less that what I expected.	2001-08-24

It through the life of the author traces the trip from an idological closet to the actual world we live in.<br />  The author's own trip and exit comes from reason, observation, and the dedication to actual goals which his movement espoused.  (More a C.S. Lewis than a Horwitz.) When eventually he saw that the cause was the end rather than the means, he recognized communism for what it was and is:  Just another device for somebody to get power.  (or in his younger days to get laid.)  It takes courage to recognize and admit when you are wrong.  If you can't you entrench yourself for self justification.  I have often wondered if the left really believes what it says, Radosh answers this question and the answer isn't pleasant.<br />  Unfortunately until the later chapters of the book the narative seems to crawl.  I found myself with minor exceptions, (such as the sleeping analysit, hilarrious!) struggling to get to the later chapters where the meat was.  The early setup chapters and the family history were interesting and his early college years were less so but passable. Once you get to the Rossenberg book and the later struggles the book seems to pick up steam and passion, perhaps the passion of the author on his conversion?<br /> As I think on the book I'm not so sure if it was just the style that is not to my taste, or if it was just poorly edited.  Thinking back it is probally the former.  I Compare it to THE DRUDGE MANIFESTO as both are books which esposue ideas which I agree with by authors I admire, but unlike The Drudge Manifesto which was a horrible read this book just seems flat to me. <br /> The style was enough to put the book to three stars for me but as far as substance goes it would be worth four.  It's definately worth a read for the historical value alone.	2001-08-23

The changes in the Social Security laws enacted in 82 caused my best friend to lose his SS benefits and work like a dog (Somedays as much as 20 hrs a day at a local diner) to afford college.  That same friend and godfather of my son still blames him, although that same friend has a killer job at a killer pay.  I didn't like or trust Reagan in the 80's.  Even as I grew more conservative and saw the results of his years I still remained ambivalent toward him.<br />This Book changed much of my mind.  Most of the arguements are straightforward and well put.  It also shows Reagan had a sense of history, that alone would increase my respect toward him.  I was struck at how timely many of the arguements therin apply today over 20 years after they were made.  Even the arguements I disagreed with were made properly and without the mallace and spin of the current day. <br />If nothing else this book should dismiss the idea that Reagan is a simpleton who didn't have his own ideas. (where have we heard this lately?)  Those who disagree with those ideas must admit at last that they were his own.<br />After reading this book I find that I like and respect Reagan much more.  If nothing else from reading it you will find him more interesting.  It can on occasion be dry reading so beware.  I can't say I loved the book but I'm glad I read it.	2001-08-20

Like all the Hornblower books we see our hero in many unconfortable positions, from the Court Martial of his successor to finding himself a junior officer in a battle situation after years of command. Unlike the other Hornblower books we are left with an incomplete story. It seems to me that this drop doesn't change a thing. <br />Most people who read Hornblower will know their Navel History and will be able to put the pieces together, (on more than one occasion Forester talks about Hornblower's fellow captians putting the pieces together from a brief statement in a report.) and the reader can do it without problem.<br />The two short stories that follow are both of high quality. (I was very disapointed that we didn't see the story of Barry McCool in the lastest Hornblower movie.) His encounter with McCool and with Napoleon III were both well written and interesting.<br />Unless you are reading the series in chronological order (don't forget to read the McCool story AFTER Midshipman Hornblower then put it away till you finish Hornlober and the Hotspur) this book should probally be read last. I wouldn't buy this book first, but I wouldn't recommend missing it either.	2001-08-10

(Short of the Bible of course)  This is a book written by a classic philosopher who was a late convert to Christianity on a RATIONAL basis.  <br />In the modern world it the idea that one could find a rational basis for Christian belief is considered a joke.  Clearly Lewis found it the opposite.  His arguements are fresh and lucid and the fact that he is well read in the ancients and the classics is evident here as he makes his case.<br />The single best thing he does here is make plain that Christianity is not the key to a pain free life or a panacea.  It is more of an acknowlidgement of a state of facts, A willingness to accept these facts knowing the consequences and rewards thereof.  His path was reason and arguement.

I've read all but one of his Sharpe and Starbuck books and have all of the Sharpe movies as well.  As a big Hornblower fan I welcomed Sharpe's Trafalgar but found myself left wanting.<br />The book opened well (the first scenes in India were first rate) I found the characters enjoyable sans a few minor flaws such as the pressing of East India men (forbidden by law) without hesitation and repeating it to Nelson.  The willingness of at British Capt to try to break a blockade in a French SOL, (Given the realities quite a stretch but in keeping with the captians name.)  The fights were not as inspiring as normal. (I think Cornwel may be out of his element here as was Sharpe.)  These were small and wouldn't mean much if fact these at might not occur to people unfamilar with Forester's Hornblower books.  But there was one scene which stopped the book for me cold.<br />During one vital scene the Sharpe confronted a foe armed with a pistol in the dark bowels of a ship foils him by dashing the oil lantern to the floor now forcing his for to confront him in a darkened room with only one shot.  A proper re-write of the page would be someting like this: <br />'...Sharpe realized his mistake just as the lantern left his hand shattering on the dry wood, in a moment the dry deck fed by the oil and flame leapped to a firey life as the most feared foe of all wooden ships made itself plain.  His foe screemed as the fire began to consume him, his struggles feeding the flames and spreading them to the baggage...'<br />Cornwell could have made Sharpe come above decks, pretend he heard the shouts and alert the crew in time to save the ship but not in time to save the clumsey fool who dropped the lantern, but he didn't.  Perhaps the book deserved another star or a half but I can't give it.	2001-07-26

Small sub articles give little stories about other little miscues (The Bridge at Spitz)all of it is readable, well illustrated and written with a european rather than an american viewpoint.  (Thus he classifeds the American indian wars as basically the same as the British Colonial wars and in doing so may be correct.  <br />The bottom line is the facts are well presented and easy on the eyes and brain without being lightweight.

His arguement that blacks (or african americans if you perfer) belong in the &quot;new&quot; group becasue it was only in the 50's and 60' that the death of &quot;Jim Crow&quot; gave them the full rights of Americans everywhere is well made.   There are several revelations here for modern americans who decended from these groups (not the least that Italians were not considered &quot;white&quot; and that all three groups were considered different races.) and these revelations should be noted and remembered by those who achieved the American dream thanks to the efforts of their grandfathers and grandmothers.   It is an optomistic book about an optomistic future for this country and it argues that the growing pains of assemilation which every past ethnic group went through is the same pain that we their decendants don't recognize in others.  He believes it will pass and in the end the genius of the concept of America will prevail for the benefit of all.  I like the arguement and despite the time, happily subscribe to it.

Normally I would have written it off as more of the unbalanced tripe that passes for educational material these days but I noticed the opposing viewpoints series label and decided to give it a try.  The book itself is a collection of essays, interviews and articles by leading proponents and opponents of various opinions.  In this volume the GENERAL TOPICS included :  WHAT IS THE STATE OF RACE RELATIONS.  IS RACISM A SERIOUS PROBLEM and others.  Sub catagoires involved topics as diverse as Anti-semitism in the black community, Support of bilingual education, and Apologizing for Slavery.  Each topic was argued on both sides and the line up was a strong one.  Clarence Page, Charles Krauthammer, Naomi Wolf and the Advisory board to the President's Initiative on Race (Clintons).  I was pleased to see that prominant black conservatives Deroy Murdock, Walter Williams, and Thomas Sowell were also included.  (None are specifically identified as black by the editor but both Williams and Murdock self identify in their respective articles.  ) This developemnt alone is a giant step forward.  At the end of the book is a list of 15 orginizations to contact for more info and here is the only place were the balance is a bit off.  The list includes of course the NAACP, ACLU, Amnesty International and the  National Urban League, It ALSO includes the Heritage Foundation,  The Cato institute and the Center for the Study of Popular Culture.  The list itself is pretty balanced , however in the write ups on each group Heritage &amp; CSPC are identified as &quot;Conservative&quot; and Cato as &quot;Libertarian&quot;, however none of the &quot;Liberal&quot; groups are identified as such.  It is a small point, worth mentioning but not enough to overcome all of the benefits of this book.  When both sides of an arguement are presented then knowledge is truly born.  This book achieves this and if it is used as a school text then it will be a small step in the right direction.  I look forward to examining the other books in the series.  Well done Mary E. Williams!	2001-07-06

It is a well written book which gives a better perspective to both characters.  As always a ripping and accurate yarn of the sea and the times.  Strangely it sufferes in comparison to the latest of the Hornblower series from A&amp;E simply since the Characters of Hobbs and Captian Sawyer are fleshed out in the series but not in this book as much.  Since the book is written in the eyes of Bush this could not be helped but it is a minor point.  As always we see resourcefullness , action and of course Whist.  A great book from a great series.  It's worth the money.	2001-06-29

Part one of the story of the &quot;renegade&quot; Simon Girty is just dying to be made into a movie.  The story itself is gripping.  A tale of a boy driven from location to location by circumstances around him.  Captured by the indians and raised for years with them we see him as he crosses the paths of names that live in history.  And ALL OF IT TRUE.  The illustrations are masterful, accurate and just a pleasure.  Tim Truman has made a masterpiece in two acts.  Don't let the graphic novel format fool you this is history and art and storytelling all in one stroke!  Buy it somewhere anywhere!	2001-06-28

We see a man propelled from a job as a Sheriff to the Presidency in a mere 8 years all because he was honest and other people and recognized his qualities.  We see a Cleveland so frugal and honest that he actually hangs two criminals himself as sheriff because #1.  paying a hangman would involve spending the public's money and #2  As sheriff it is his responsibility and he will not duck a responsibility just because it is unplesant.  He doesn't fail to hide the warts or the poor decisions, however he doesn't bother to hide his current political bias either.  More than once poke a jab at modern conservatives.  This is quite amazing as Mr. Cleveland is as much the ANTI-Clinton as any elected offical can be.  Other than that problem this book is a great introduction to one of the more forgotten men in our history who shouldn't be.  Cleveland easily makes my top 10 (maybe even top 5) list of presidents.  Maybe after reading this book he'll appear on a few more peoples lists as well.	2001-06-22

Get Fishbait Millers book (doorman of the house).  If you wan't some of the low down and nasty of politicts rough language and all get John Farrell's book.  But if you want an enchanting story, The story of a people and a culture.  A story painting all that is best in America this one is it.  The stories of Curley and Rayburn and the early days in the Mass State House are a joy.  The stories of Work Buttons and bricklayers make you remember that all wasn't always well or easy in America.  More than in the latest volume you see WHY Thomas P &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill believed what he believed and battled for what he battled.  His inability to say no might not serve today, but his belief in what was right yet willingness to respect those against him would be a godsend today.  This book like a Jimmy Stewart or John Wayne paints a picture of what is great in America, it's the picture the way we'd like it to be, the way I think O'Neill wanted people to strive for.  Its a picture of looking out for the other guy and all the stories of all the regular people that come with it.  It's portrait of the regular guy is its charm, and the stories THE STORIES mother's milk for the political junkie.  If you want all of the rough edges Farrell's book is probally better, but if you want the essence of a great man this book should be your choice.	2001-06-18

Farrell paints an accurate picture warts and all (not TOO many warts to see anyway.) of one of my heroes.  Tip O'Neill never forgot where he came from and because of that he was able to change his times.  Farrell corrects and augments some stories from the O'Neill autobiography and adds a few of his own to the mix.  We see a man who can be profane (but never to or in front of a Lady&gt;) Who can be sneaky (but always for the cause) and who will make a deal (but not against his loyalties.)  He spent and spent but always for jobs.  Anybody's jobs.  We see a man who's word is his word, but who is willing to look the other way on a scandal (Gary Studds was a Massachusetts Demorcrat after all) and who kept a grudge but never forever.  The theme of the book seems to be that Tip and his ilk and what they supported were the building blocks of the middle class we have today.  I tend to agree.  Sort of a doctor who puts himself out of business by curing his patients.  His fights against Reagan were principled and at the time I agreed with him.  This books paints that picture of a person fighting always for the common man and with a love of country and all it stands for, I get the feeling that if he were alive in 1998 Al Gore would have been president that year.  Farrell picture of the man makes me miss him more	2001-06-18

It implies that Africa doesn't have a rich enough culture to be proud of and that is a shame.  It is a crime that Mary Lefkowitz needed to write such a book, however since it has to be done she does it well.  Step by step she gives actual evidence to refute claims born out of rage and inadaquacy.  The best arguements involve (in my opinion) pointing to the lack of a propaganda attack on Cleopatra for her race by her &amp; Ceasar's foes.  It is a fine example of how people and politicts don't change only the technology they use does.  She points out not just the factual errors but the inherant dangers of spreading a fantasy and beliving a lie for political purposes.  Those who do are made of the stuff of those who don't care for those they incite and exist only to destory.  All of the greatest tyrants used such tactics as the basis for their rule.  Such illusions are usually shattered at a great price.  Lets hope that we as a society and particularly the young African American community don't to pay it.	2001-06-11

This is likely because you don't see much fiction on the particular war in question elsewhere.  Cornwell handles this setting well from details on how a cannon ball is meant to take out ranks to the culture of the foe and friend in India.  As always the action is great, the battles realistic and the characters great.  If there is any weakness to be found it is working under the limitations of a prequel.  I think the arab servant would have been a great character to bring to England, (It would have made the next two books more interesting.)  Of course we KNOW Sharpe will survive and his son will be in America to meet Starbuck.  (I have this picture in my mind of Sharpe's young arab servant grown up and the mentor of Patrick in the Crimeria.)  Cornwell writes a great book and his look at the British Army Circa 1800-1815 and the way the average soldier thinks is yet another reason to buy and enjoy this series.  Lets hope Cornwell never gets bored with this character.  We certanily wont.	2001-06-10

It mixes action and characters better than any other. It keeps the reader glued and wanting more.  You find yourself caring for these characters more and more in this particular book and Rayford interaction with the newest member of the tribulation force is very well done.<br /> In a long series it's not easy to maintain the quality of events and characters, the series as a whole does and this book in particular does it best.

They don't change their views to fit the facts, they change the facts to fit their views, and thats a real problem if you are one of the facts that need changing!\\"<br /> Horowitz is one of the facts that some need to change. Many of his charges are a matter of public record and can't be crediblly refuted such as the actual speeches of radicals of the 60's as to what they actually thought of MLK. Thus name calling is substituted for an actual refuting of facts by some. <br />The book is a book of opinion. I think that at times Mr. Horowitz makes the same mistake of the left (for example his article about Chile) by deemphising the crime for the result. A murder who murders 1 is as disgusting as one who murders 100. His arguements are to some extent tinged with the need for redemption. He sees his own mistakes and regrets them, I think however on occasion he forgets that it took a murder for his mind to go on the final road of change. Many on the left haven't (God forbid) had that experience sort of like the old joke that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged.<br /> I think he needs to give some slack to those who may not see what he sees, but he does skewer falsehood and self serving statements by many. The best part about this book, (Much like Carville's WHERE RIGHT THERE WRONG) is it makes an arguement and makes one think, but only if there is an open mind to do so. The short article nature of the book makes it easy to read and the stories covered are well done and bring back personal memories for me.<br />  All in all both leftists and rightest should read it, one to refute and one to affirm, however you can't have an arguement without two sides. As a general rule, he who calls names has no viable arguement.	2001-06-07

Calculating the way out of his torment, Calculating the true &quot;EVEN CHANCE&quot; (One Pistol Loaded One not.)  These short stories set a fine tone for the rest.  Forester lets his character develop here to grow the man that would command the books in his novel already written.  Each story builds more of the &quot;hornblower&quot; way from decisive and caluclation action to his own judgement of himself which is always the harshist.  The advantage of several short stories allows several short reads.  Like a fisherman these stories bait the reader.  By the end we are hooked and ready for LIEUTENANT HORNBLOWER.

It dragged and droned with cardboard speeches and a sudden character morph.  In any series of fiction a willing suspension of disbelief is needed.  I was unable to generate it here.  One of the strengths of the series is the possibility that this can happen.  It is the thing that made the Exorcist the most frightning movie i've ever seen.  This book loses that sense till near the very end.  Every writer is entitled to one lemon, hopefully the is Lahaye's and Jenkins only one.	2001-05-26

In my opinion he, AL FRANKEN is a very funny man and makes some good points in his; AL FRANKEN'S book.  I particularly enjoyed the part when he, AL FRANKEN describes his attempt to pin down Mr. Reagan on a question in New Hampshire resulting in the ejection of him AL FRANKEN from the press bus. You know after thinking about all the parts of this book I enjoyed, I kinda think he, AL FRANKEN deserves maybe 3 1/2 stars instead of 3 but unfortunately for every comic part of his; AL FRANKEN'S book I remember his unabashed worship of a president who is the poster boy of the dishonesty that he AL FRANKEN claims to dislike.  His arguements are weaker than a person of his, AL FRANKEN'S intelect should give, and his idolitry of Bill Clinton frankly is benieth a person with the intellect of AL FRANKEN but his humor from the Rush weight chart (which will now have to be modified in new editions if he; AL FRANKEN, ever gets a reprint out.) to the fantasy vietnam sequence are a good laugh.  His, AL FRANKEN'S attacks on Rush don't wash as it's more a question of how you look at numbers, (sort of like the tax cut arguement percentage vs whole dollars) but they are fun.  I would recommend a series of debates between him AL FRANKEN and equally funny Ben Stein.  I know that for him, AL FRANKEN it won't be as much fun as hanging out with Ariana Huffington who looks better but it would be informative and a lot of fun.  Anyway in the end he AL FRANKEN has written a funny book, worth a read, sure.  Worth your dollars?  Well I'm not sure, but if you do buy it I'm sure he AL FRANKEN will be grateful.	2001-05-25

If you did, this book affirms and confirms the moves made by Mr. Gore in his attempt to reverse the outcome of the election.<br />Of course some will dismiss Mr. Sammon quickly but he provides backround and gives a human face to the little people that the Democrats profess to (and at one time did) represent.<br /> The information was well presented and interesting however a few things keep it from the five star level. <br />#1. Mr. Sammon fails to point out that Mr. Bush had the chance to call for recount in three states (Iowa, Oregon and I think Wisconson [I may be wrong about the last one]) this contrast between Bush & Gore's tactics is significant giving credence to his thesis that Gore was willing to do anything to win.<br /> #2 It would have been good to contrast the fact that Mr. Gore campaigned till the last moment on election day vs Mr. Bush. It is fair to say that Mr. Gore's efforts had a dramatic effect on the returns. It was a legatimate factor in the closeness of the race.  If Bush campaigned harder would we have been in that situation?<br /> #3 Mr Sammon doesn't point out the simply lousy presentation of Mr. Bush's team before the Florida Supreme court on the first case. The lawyer whose name escapes me (lucky for him) was simply awful.  He sounded confused and unorgnized. Even if you believe (as I do) that the  Florida Supreme Court already made up its mind, you must conceed that if it hadden't, that horrible  presentation would have done it for them. <br />#4 and last Tennesee. Mr. Sammon points to the single least reported story of election night, the bias in reporting states. It was quite apparent (OK I admit it, the day before the election I sent Rush an e-mail predicting this tactic it so its personal for me)but I must disagree on Tennessee. Bush taking that state was big news but If I was anetwork I would have looked long and hard before calling it for Bush. If there was ever a time to wait and be sure it was there. I recall the networks pointing to the fact that it was too close to call as Significant.<br />  He did make some interesting points that were not generally noticed by other books that deserve mention. <br />#1 I didn't know about the associated press numbers VS the VNS numbers.  Useful information.<br /> #2. Mary Matalin. It is one of the least reported facts that she had it right first when everybody else on TV had it wrong and was willing to stick her neck out and SAY SO before everybody else. <br />#3 The reporting of states. (SEE #4 ABOVE)<br /> #4 The concentric circle stuff. That was one story I never heard. <br />     I must also commend his defense of Mr. Gore's decision to revoke his concession on election night. At the time and in those circumstances it was a move that was justified. Of course it doesn't let him off the hook for his later decisions and Sammon doesn't. I liked the interview with Beckel as well.  <br /> All and all a fine effort.	2001-05-20

As a moral for children it is a good story.  My oldest read it to our youngest as we left the bookstore after both of them were using its title as their battle cry.  I don't know if the story made the proper impression, My take is although it is a good lesson and well drawn, it will take more than one book to teach this story, (Particulary with toys other than stuffed animals, I can't figure how you would frame it with shall we say star wars toys.) however it is a good effort readable and understandable by kids.

This was a book I looked forward to.  Mr Schippers is one of the true heroes of this sorry story that was impeachment.  He presents his case well and is much harder on the republicians then his fellow demorcrats (as well he should be.)  In my opinion it should have been titled outrage.  This is because his outrage positively pours from every page and gives an unpleasant flavor to a story which is outragous enough on its own.  The evidence he presents is a tad dry, but that is the nature of the evidence not a problemm with the writer.  It is needed to make his case and his case would suffer without it.

His arguements aren't shrill and phony.  They are well made with personal backround which makes them even clearer.  His dream sequence at the start of the book is worth a trip to the library and bookstore on its own.  I haven't figured out yet if this is the master stratigest who uses the best style possible of to make his case in whatever medium he is using.  His arguements are refutable and debatable but that is the joy of opinion.  If is television arguements were made in the style of his book, I would think much higher of him.

He says it fearlessly and directly in the manor of a grandparent talking to her daughter who has read a million books on child rearing but still can't get her kid to listen.  The act of dispelling myths is a thankless tasks, particularly since so many profit by them.  Elder hits each situation head on and reminds me of an incident I once experienced:  At my business years ago a young black kid was caught shoplifting by an employee (also a teenager) as per standing orders he called the police.  The kids mother came in fuming and asked to speak with the employee.  Aranging a meeting they went upstairs and went at it neither backing down an inch.  As she left she greeted another black customer at the counter, which produced this conversation. ME:  Do you know her CUSTOMER:  Yea, thats XXXXX, (slight pause) she's a racist. ME:  Why do you say that?  CUSTOMER:  She doesn't like my mom 'cause she's white.  At that the entire store broke out laughing.  It taught a valuable lesson.  Mr. Elder's similar experience brought me back.  Elders points on non-racial issues are well argued and well taken as well.  They are presented with conviction without being so preachy that they are unreadable.  He doesn't shrink from the arguement but over and over makes the point that denying what's in front of your face solves nothing.  As long as our society fails to do that we will be in a dire situation.  As long as books like Mr. Elder's are published, read and thought on we will be ok.	2001-05-14

Over the next 50 years (If I live that long) I expect to read many from all viewpoints not to mention history textbooks, which I collect.  I suspect that I won't enjoy any of them as much as I enjoyed this one.    This book is more that just about a historical event.  It is, much like Mr. Shippers SELLOUT a book about right vs wrong, about principle.  Unlike Mr. Shippers effort (which I enjoyed) this book flows.  We see Starr and his staff, going forward, dodging and weaving 'round the obsticles put in their path by the White House and their friends.  The story winds and keeps even one who knows the story in anticipation.  The climax of the book Starr's appearance before the judiciary invokes all of the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington images that a person like me who should be more jaded lives for.  It is a powerful testament to doing what you believe is right.  It works as history, it works as storytelling and it most important it works by displaying all that is right about this country in the midst of all that is wrong.	2001-05-14

Whatever political stripe you might have his web site offers links to everything a conservative or liberal might want to read.  His links to Islamic, North Korean and Red China's web sites give great insights to how others think (and try to control the thoughts of others) and he usually scoops the papers by at least a day or so.  It was with this anticipation that I read his book, and crashed!     A great subject matter, a prolific writer, a riviting story, and I person I admired.  With all that going for it I was stunned with the failure of this book.  The failure comes not from any of those things, but in the readability test.       If I have ever read a worse edited book I can't remember it.  It struggles and crawls with only the rarest bursts of spark for the reader.  As one who agrees with Drudge's philosophy and many of his conclusions I was disappointed.  Half of the battle of the arguement is how the case is made.  It was made in such a convluted way that it was a real struggle to get through it.  On occasion the sheer excitement of the historical events and his part in them overcame the writing but that was rare.  I did, however enjoy the tactic of intergrating the quotes on him into the text.  A fine move in an otherwise dissapointing attempt.  Perhaps after enduring 8 years of style over substance he eskues style, or perhaps the book is a tribute to the bare bones no nonsence style of his site.  If that is the case then I suggest that is stick to what he does best.	2001-05-14

As a Catholic after recovering my shock at this book and the various reviews (AH HA NOW WE SEE THROUGH THAT CHARLITON etc...!) I decided to read this book myself to see what was being said.  I found the book compact and  easy to read and much to my surprise VERY AMUSEING!<br />    It wasn't the  facts as presented that amused me.  They were presented in a fairly  straight forward manner.  It wasn't the attacks on Mother Teresa's order  methods from the doctor or the nurse.  Both have the right to their opinion  aquired first hand though apparently the vast majority of people who also  have the same first hand knowledge would disagree.  It wasn't even the  attacks on her for not rejecting people like Baby Doc, and Keating (I note  the authors political leanings glaring out when he lumps Reagan with that  group.)  It doesn't seem odd to myself that a person unwilling to reject  the lowest of the low of the poor and feeble would reject anybody from any  station (that is the whole tennent of Christianity love of neighbor not of  GOOD neighbors only) I'm sure that Mr. Hitchens would be happy to provide  us all with an approved list of people we can associate with to be  considered saintly.<br />  The two things that got me laughing out loud was  his SHOCKING DISCOVERY that a Roman Catholic Nun would have Roman Catholic  Beliefs and would consider her primary mission to spread those beliefs!   And his belief apparently in a Vast Vatican Conspiracy against the world of  which he considers Mother Teresa a part.  How amazing that a member of a  religious order would consider the salvation of souls the most important  thing there is above all else.  I'm reminded of Lincoln when asked about  slavery to paraphrase:  &quot;My primary purpose is to save the Union, If I  can save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; If I can save it by  freeing none of the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing  some and leaving others in bondage I would do that too.&quot;Apparently  her and her orders ACTIONS are inaquate since they don't come to the  standard of Mr. Hitchens FEELINGS on how they should be done.  Once again  we see the example one who FEELS the right way is superior to one who ACTS  and doesn't reach the level demanded by the feelings of the other.  (For  myself I don't see how refusing medical care offer to her would have made  the lives of others better.) I'm sure that using the profits from this book  and others the Hitchens hospice for the dying will do much better.  Who  would believe that a Catholic Nun would be more concerned with the soul  than the body?  Amazing!  It is even more amusing to see Mr Hitchens make  his arguement that it is all part of the evil Roman Catholic Churches'  master plan.  It displays a complete ignornace or misunderstanding of  Christianity in general and the Roman Catholic church in particular at best  or at worst a complete UNDERSTANDING of the Church and its message  concerning the soul, that this world is transitory vs eternity.  To any  reader of this book I must recommend C.S. Lewis' Classic THE SCREWTAPE  LETTERS (in particular #28) I suspect the reader will find its arguemnts  similar to what he reads here.<br />  In short Mr. Hitchens makes the  following arguement:  The Roman Catholic Church is an evil conspiracy; (All  dogs are pink.)  Mother Teresa is a member in high standing of the church;  (Lou is a Dog) THEREFORE Mother Teresa is not a potential saint or even a  doer of good works but mearly a cog in that conspiricy to harm mankind.  (Therefore Lou is Pink.)  The intelligent man, well read in history, will  see through this arguement (DOGS AREN'T PINK) in the same way the child saw  the emperor had nothing on.  The incidious plan of the church if there is  one is to repeat to all people in the world the offer of forgivness and  salvation that Jesus Christ continues to make to all.  If this is the  conspiracy that Mr. Hitchens fears then I suggest that he needs Mothers  prayers far more than the dying in her followers care.	2000-06-18
