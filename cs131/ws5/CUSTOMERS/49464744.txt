US	49464744	R87FP7IWTULQ0	0451182790	345843156	The Marquess	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Nice book, though boring at times.	I must admit, the characterizations are wonderful and really interesting. The book is really good, and the story is nicely written, but at times i can't help but wonder why it's taking so long to finish the darned story. At some places it hardly even moves. But for these lagging points, the book would be excellent.<br />The story is basically about a scarred man who hides from society thinking he's ugly. But his brother ends up rescuing a heiress from a fire and brings her home. the lady's companion, Dillian, sneaks into the house and lives there like a ghost, since she's worried that the two men mean the heiress harm. She is eventually discovered (that was the most fun part of the book...the 'ghost' of the mansion being discovered). It is from this point that the story lags. They try to find out who set the fire, and who is responsible for trying to end the hieress's life. Interwoven in this is the romance between Gavin, the scarred brother, and Dillian. He thinks he's an ugly beast, while she tries to convince him he's not. But in the end all works out. Dillian is the best character of all. She fiesty and spirited and kind and generous...etc. On the whole it was nice...but definitely not recommended for anyone who hates historicals.	2000-11-20

All I can say is, WOW.<br />This book is a breathtaking spectacle of color, textures, emotions, and INTELLIGENCE. What I mean is, this just isn't a book of random photographs...these are exquisitely beautiful, intelligent photographs. The fact that the pictures have been taken in India makes it more exotic and adds a bit of spice to the already obvious mysticism.<br />I can't say I'm a professional at photograpgy, but even i can see the classiness of this piece of art. If you love photos, exotic cultures, or even a bit of sensitivity in photographs, this book is definitely a recommended buy. <br />Signing off,<br />Secret Agent Booker	2000-11-20

Inspite of all the comments, the book wasn't that terribly written. <br />Like the author, who is a scientist, the book is presented from a scientific viewpoint. If you expect to read something thrilling and sensationsal, then I'm afraid you've got to look elsewhere for thrills. This is suprisingly interesting for something that's supposed to be boring. <br />The book is partly autobiographical...it relates the experiences of the author during the time he was involves with Stargate, the official paranormal investigation. He mainly talks about how he came to be involves in paranormal invesigation, his beliefs and opinions, and then he goes on to narrate how his experiences came to make a believer out of him. His narrations are pretty good, and they cover all of the various types of psi phenomena. Of course, all being in one book, you can't expect a whole course jammed into each subtopic, but nevertheless, it makes a person sufficiently educated. Several real life happenings are included with each type of psi phenomena, so it makes it more interesting. If that's not good enough, the bonus is a chapter at the end that tells you how you can devlop your own psi powers (though if it works is another matter). Anyway, this is a good book overall. Not award winning material, but a very good book nonetheless.	2000-11-20

There's nothing much to say about the book since it's an encyclopedia, but the quality is excellent. There are tons of color photographs, and they're all very enlightening.

Secondly, this is the first book I've  ever read by this author. But everything considered, i had a wonderful  time! I liked the story a lot, and plot, twists, and characterizations were  remarkable. The story is about a young woman named Julia who is out for  revenge...by seduction. Lord Stonehaven is the unlucky fellow who is the  target, after blaming an embezzlement on Julia's brother, Selby. If that  wasn't bad enough, Selby's suicide makes things worse, and Julia blames the  whole death and break up of her family on Stonehaven.She makes good plans  for revenge, and is even admirable in all her endeavors, but she forgot  something...she didn't take her attraction for him into account. The book  is humorous while intriguing, and I just couldn't put it down. The  characters were amazing, and it was so good that I read the whole book in  one stretch...it was THAT good. Just a small drawback...I didn't find it  that far behind in time. Though it was supposed to have taken place in  1811, it somehow seemed modern, and I didn't have a sense of being  displaced in time. But overall it was an extremely good read.	2000-08-24

I've  been searching for romance books with people having disablities, and found  a gem in a million. About loving inspite of disabilities, this book touches  the chord of the true meaning of love and romance. Keely, an olympic runner  involved in an accident, is determined to continue her career inspite of  the odds, and she doesn't intend to stop until she has a gold medal. So she  goes to her old coach, Mac, to help with her rehab, and meets him after  many years. But she's shocked to discover that he's crippled for life in a  wheelchair. Their old attraction flames to life, but with a small  obstacle....the disabilities of Mac. While's she unsure how to treat him  and ends up fumbling and hurting his feelings, he thinks the relationship  is doomed since he cannot lead a normal life doing basic things, like  controlling his bladder or making love, and is embarassed a lot. But in the  end love triumphs, and after a lot of trials and tribulations, they do  indeed live happily ever after. The characters are truly lovable,  especially Mac, and like the cover blurb says, you are really lucky is you  read this book. The tears and laughter are sure to flow with this book. And  not only is the roamnce wonderful, it also provides insight about how the  disabled really live.	2000-08-24

At first the title intrigued me, but as i got down to reading the book, I  found that the title had nothing much to do with the story. But  nevertheless, i enjoyed the book. It's about the murder of an old lady, and  the suspects are the relatives after her money. So what's the title have to  do with the book? Simple. Only one witness was there to this murder...and  the witness is dumb. yep... we're talikng about her pet dog here. The irony  to the story is that inspite of having a witness, Poirot has to unravel the  mystery, with hardly any clues. But poirot being poirot solves the  mystery....making another good book to read. Most of christie's books are a  bit similar, but not exactly same, making it possible to read most of her  books without getting bored. While this sounds like one of those typical  books, it's really not. Read it...then you'll see.	2000-08-24

Strange fact two: the group is lead by Christy's psychic aunt  Tillie(appearing in many Rita Rainville books) who believes that Christy is  an alien. Well anyway, they tresspass on Shane McBride's property, and are  unwillingly put up by him when one of their trailers explode. The rest of  the story is about Tille (well atleast the main part anyway) who manages to  shock people all the time with her true predictions, and communications  with her dead husband. In the midst of all this confusion, including the  nine other passengers,some paranormal occurances, and a UFO sighting, is  the romance between Christy and Shane. With all their attraction, their  emotional baggages (he with past marriages and she with three ex-fiances)  keep them apart till the end. A little strange, and a little too hard to  handle, but those who go in for these types of books will enjoy it. For  everyone else: plenty of humor for all you normal folks out there.	2000-05-26

He an extroverted playboy, and she a reserved, domesticated woman with dreams of white gowns , burst into  flames with their attraction for each other. The only complications...she  refuses him saying she needs commitment, he pleads with her saying he can't  commit, and a minor detail...a baby. This is one of the book in the series  &quot;Three cowboys and a baby&quot;, in which one of three drunk cowboys  impregnate a woman, all of them thinking it's themselves, with nobody  knowing who the father is till the last book. In this book, Travis is sure  it's his, and Gwen too, disapprovingly, thinks it's Travis who's the  irresponsible father, putting more distance between them as Gwen worries  the mother will appear on the scene and cause problems. Needless to say, at  the risk of revealing too much, things work out in the end with Travis  letting out his 'big' secret of why his lifestyle is what it is. A nice,  interesting story...something different.The only negative aspect is that  the characters are somehow lacking in something. But adding the equation of  a reluctant girl, a big-muscled hunk who can change diapers, and lots of  attraction, it adds up to a good book.	2000-05-26

(Silhouette Romance, No.1448)	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Morris tells a different story	Other than the title of the book (Actually, the the guy pursues Hannah, not the other way round as it seems to hint) the story, characterization, and settings are pretty good. Set in alaska, it provides a different  atmosphere from most books. The story line is a bit weak, and the story  lacks lustre in a few spots here and there, but it is the strength of the  characters that props the book up and keeps it interesting. Emotions seem  to be a forte with this author, and with better luck future novels could be  best-sellers. In all, the atmosphere of tension makes it good reading.	2000-05-26

This edition is one of the best as it brings two of the best loved tales together, giving a chance to analyze and compare the stories, characters, etc. I'm not going  to give a synopsis as there are plenty around, so I'll just expound on why  this book was better.<br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: This classic love story about  Elizabeth and Darcy can always definitely leave a person with a warm fuzzy  feeling, how many ever times read. my favorite scene...when Darcy  unexpectedly returns home and Elizabeth is seeing his house, thinking he  wouldn't be there.<br />SENSE AND SENSIBILITY: Who can forget Elinor and  Marianne? Austen captures the human mind so well that it can almost be us  she's talking about. There are too many favorite scenes in this one to even  choose one to mention, it's so hard! <br />In all, both these stories are  really essential in any educated person's library. Heck, you can even get  the whole collection of books, it absolutely worth your while. I've read  all of Austen's books so many times that I just got the whole colection.	2000-05-26

Oliver Kemp, a self-made man from a poor background, hires a young inexperienced woman as a favor for his business associate, even though his better instincts tell him not to.

This forms the backbone of the whole book, this  clashing of the two individuals because of their different upbringings.  All's well till animal attraction gets out of hand, making Fran pregnant.  Honorable Oliver marries her, and till the very end neither confesses that  they are truly,madly and deeply in love with each other.

Caleb Tanner is a millionaire playboy who can't keep his hands off women, even in trouble. Not a single simpering female has managed to tame him...till came Sabrina Saunders. This charming and at times funny story is  about a playboy doing the impossible, falling in love with one woman for  life. The heroine is bold, sassy and intelligent, and will appeal to many  readers. It's got all the ingredients of a good book charm, humor, and  attraction. The only thing missing from the is depth of emotion... Leigh  doesn't explore the inner souls of the characters, which is usually what  readers look for. But if you like light hearted books, then this is the one  for you.	2000-05-26

Ridiculed by most men, she's in search of a 'perfect father' to give her a child, partly to prove her womanhood to the  world, and partly because her biological clock has kicked in. So off she  goes to England, from America, to try and meet some distant Crighton male  relative (who, by the way, are all very sexy men known for their virile  Crighton genes) to give her a child. Yup, in case you're wondering, this is  a book in the 'Crighton' series, about a large family legacy, and their  loves and lives. Anyway, she leaves, leaving behind her crush since youth,  Liam, her father's assistant since her childhood and long time family  friend. He never showed interest in her as a woman, but after Samantha's  departure, Liam suddenly longs to be the father. The rest of the story is  about Liam following her to England, and the both of them discovering each  other as man and woman, not brother and sister or long time friends. Story  is great, plot is great, people are great, and best is the attraction.  Couldn't get a better book than that even if I had written it myself.	2000-05-26

Two distantly related members of the Crighton family, Kate Crighton(who is a Crighton) and Sebastian Cooke(whose  cousin married a Crighton) meet for the first time, not very surprising  considering the fact that in this whole series, Crightons seem to be  popping all over the place, being such a large family. Their first meeting  is not a pleasant one, with Sebastian's car almost hitting Kate, who  happened to be walking on the road. With an instant dislike on both sides,  they were none too pleased to find they were related. But the main essence  of the story is finding out that they are neighbors (both of them,  new-comers to the town, having moved into the same apartment complex). In  spite of all the hostility, the undeniable attraction between them ensures  a happy ending. The main plus points of the book are the flaming passion  between the main characters, and the sometimes humorous portrayal of the  match-making family. A good book if I ever read one.	2000-05-26

Books	2	2	2	N	N	Very very average	Same old formula...strangers on a train mix posessions (though mobile phones in this case, not briefcases,or files, or whatever), meet each other again, fall in love, get married, live happily ever after. The only thing  keeping them apart from the start of the book till the end is the heroine's  unwillingness to get involved with a man again after her late husband left  her life in a mess, complete with two kids. The main characters, Matthew  and Georgia, acknowledge their attraction, but only trust is in the way,  therefore dragging the story somewhat. The characters don't shine,  conversation doesn't sparkle, and in all it just turns out to be any ole'  book.	2000-05-26
