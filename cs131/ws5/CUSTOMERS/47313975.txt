I was more interested in the romance than the mystery and that is my clue that something was missing.  Mystery, first with me. The only reason the romance was more interesting was that there were 2 going at the same time.  Paradise and Perfect were better reads. Get it from the library.	2003-03-09

Jessie shines in this one.  I was puzzled by the convoluted motives of the bad guy.I guess Sue Henry wanted to make the book as mysterious as possible.  I felt the frustration that the main characters had, but went along with the story anyway. I felt strongly agitated when the bad guy went after the dogs.  I would give a lot to have a friend like Tank.:) The ending was really a reach but all's well that ends well.  Altogether it was a competent and enjoyable read. On to the next.	2003-02-09

This book relives that Inner Passage voyage with the Spirit of 98 brilliantly. Each town is described excellently. Mystery was inventive. I recognized so many real people in this book.

This was on the mystery shelf at the library and since I havent read too much of Karen Robards, decided to give it a try. <br />It's a fun read. Mystery was confusing; I like procedurals mostly, but the romance was fun. Love when two people get together after ending in a clash in the past.  <br />Carly was a bundle of nerves which was sometimes annoying but she comes back to Georgia after a bad divorce to recoup her life and discovers Matt all over again.  Actually, it was mostly centered on the on-again -- off-again aspect of the romance.  The mystery doesnt interfere much. :D<br />Altogher it takes about 3 hours to read and was a pleasant weekend read.	2003-01-28

Never saw it coming. And I liked the fact that I didnt.  <br />Norm Lewis is missing and a woman is found shot dead in his plane bogged down in water.  His wife, Alex Jensen and a few others plod into the wilderness after their plane is grounded in an effort to find Norm and instead, find trouble in several forms.<br />The opening chapter is marvelous.

They work on instinct and have no intention of going after us unless we are in their way.<br />What a book! An exciting read. The ending is cheating but what the heck!

You must read the others, Sea Swept is the first, you owe it to yourself.  Cam was my favorite being the first and oldest, and it was a powerful story setting up the rest. His relationship with Seth was, in my opinion, the best.  <br />With Chesapeake Blue, Seth is all 'growed' and comes home for spiritual strength where he knows he will find it. What a lucky guy! Nice romance but the interaction with his family is still the best part. Stella comes back for Seth, which was a nice touch. <br />I also had a hard time with the hardcover. All the others were, let's face it, romances, and paperback is their niche.  Also more collectible. If you havent read Linda Howard's Mackenzie's Mountain series, do yourself a favor and look for them. Wonderful reading for some quiet time.	2002-12-23

Funny and loving. I am from Massachusetts so it was a little more endearing. <br />Julie's remarks to herself (and you) are wonderful and you will smile, smile, and giggle out loud.  There are so many truism's in this book, one has to live long enough to recognize them. <br />The two 60 year olds give us hope for our retirement years. Just when the book get a little dark, the sun comes out again. Julie's daughters, especially Nora, are great. Romeo's sons are so funny and typical. (ooops, I shouldnt say that). Hey, I'm part Italian and I'll say it!<br />To me this book was homey, loving, sentimental and a feel good read.	2002-12-02

The beginning premise on how Molly and Kevin get together was a little too out there and if I were not stuck in the middle seat of an airplane I would have tossed it. <br />Once you accept this premise like a good sport(?) the book falls into place and my plane ride zoomed by.  Kevin and Molly strive for a solution to their problem and when they finally discuss it, it is very poignant. I liked that. There is no mean spirit in this book. The repartee is excellent between Kevin and Molly and Lily and Liam. I needed to know the solution. <br />Well, after the children story prefaces to each chapter, it did seem to come together.  Bringing in Phoebe, Cal and their family was great. Those girls were adorable. The baseball game did it for me! Loved it. Lily and Liam were an added hot item.

Lots of excitement in this one and a favorite character almost gets killed. (would hate to see that).  But Dillon is ever watchful and this makes a good afternoon read. Always get a nice, exciting read from Jack Higgins. Kate and Sean duel it out at the end but is Kate really gone for good? Yes, eh, maybe. That was left a little cloudy.

They were both survivors.  Their relationship was HOT. Julie was a very innocent character after all she had been thru, I thought she would have more street smarts, but then there wouldn't have been much of a story.  Ms McNaught writes rather lengthy stories but it is well worth you time.  I like this author!	2002-04-30

Ms. McNaught certainly wrote something different. It was long and descriptive but intriqued as well. Meredith's relationship with her father was strange. Her relationship with Matt was HOT! The book was very interesting in many ways. Yes, the scene where Meredith explains to Matt about losing the baby will tug at any woman's heart. This book held my interest. On to Perfect.	2002-04-30

I am flying thru the Anita series and Laurell Hamilton has one active imagination. This time Edward calls in a favor and Anita answers.  It's great ride. Over the top and the last is so exciting you cannot put the book down.  Edwards business associates are so scary Anita has to really stay on her toes as well as fighting the bad guys.  I never thought this genre would interest me but Laurell Hamilton is worth the try.  Anita definitely needs a vacation after this one. Nail biting time!	2002-04-13

Anita finally softens to him when he is at his weakest!  There is the 'baddest' Master Vampire of them all-Seraphina and she really knows how to get to Anita.  <br />This series is so imaginative and Anita is wonderful to watch.

Peabody gets a spotlight. But Eve and Roarke's first anniversary celebration will bring tears to ardent fans and the ballroom showdown is stupendous. What an entertaining series!

It's a decent story/mystery/romance.  The heroine is a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force. Her devotion to duty and principle was a tribute to women in command. She gambles all for a guy who is not your typical military hero and lets her judgement and heart be her guide.  She is not compromised.  Nice read.	2002-03-03

I liked it a lot but thought the genre was not for me. Then I began at the beginning of the series which I usually do.  I love Anita! Full out guts. Could barely put the book down. There is a lot of humor, compassion and wit on Anita's part. I am getting acquainted with all the characters, good and bad, that are a part of her life. Ms Hamilton has a vivid imagination!

At times I thought I skipped the first book because the references were vague. I am glad I stuck with it because the wry humor was excellent.  I like to begin at the start of a series to get the flavor (pardon the expression) of the story.  I like Anita very much. She has a conscience!  The ending was very exciting.  The book held my interest all through.  Very different and entertaining. On to the next.	2002-02-18

Kincaid and Gemma are there but it is more a story centering on Glastonbury Abbey and the people involved with it.  It was quite interesting.  Gemma's secret is revealed at the end, so I am looking forward to the next edition.<br />The last 90 pages of the book are very exciting and you waver back and forth on who the murderer is.

I am reading this series in succession and very much enjoying it.<BR>You've read the synopsis of the book.  The story weaves back and forth, somewhat convoluted. Gemma almost strays with Gordon. Some may be disappointed in this but really, should Kincaid have all the delicious temptations before he realizes Gemma is the ONE!  The solution was surprising, but DC had to find a murderer and it was different.  I thought the ending(s)tightened up nicely. I always like to know what happens to everyone. A quick read!	2002-01-13

For me, it started slowly and I had to really believe that something good was coming down the pike.  While Carmen and Reacher were driving along in the car was very boring to me but as I stayed with it. Then when Reacher was taken into a bar by the ranch hands I began to sit up straight and pay attention. Reacher is over the top and such fun to read! The fight in the desert is wild.  The description of the Texas heat is right on and you get thirsty just reading about it.  Toward the end, it dragged on and out a bit but I certainly will read the next book about Jack Reacher as soon as it comes out.  Worth my time!	2001-12-28

This author is from Texas but writes like a British author.  This is my second in the series and am I glad to have found it.  I am adding her to my collection of P. D.

I bought the audio of the first 4 and will listen to all.  Geraldine James stunned me with her pure reading of these books and altho I love to read the words myself, her rendition of these books is outstanding. She does Jamie and Claire so well my heart breaks.  Her reading Claire is just the most wonderful tone that she makes Claire real. I can once more hear how Jamie is Claire's only anchor in this unique experience.  Ms James' voice is soothing, the background music is perfect. These tapes were worth every penny. Ms James is one of the best readers I have ever heard.	2001-12-10

I bought the book for Jamie and Claire and loved every minute of their romance, wit and struggle.  Roger, Brianna and Jemmy are boring by themselves but interacting with Jaime and Claire it was bearable.  Many interesting adventures in this one, especially the last 400 pages.  This book is a hand-full, literally, but I will buy the next, just to keep up with the Frasers!	2001-11-26

I have been reading Lee Child's books in order and this one was kind of disappointing. Knew fairly early who the killer was because I happened to remember one sentence in the beginning chapters.Fort Dix is NOT a Marine base! Heavens, what a boo boo!(My husband is a formr Marine)and his Mecca is much further south. And I really hope our FBI isnt similar to the protrayal in this story. Altho the premise was a new one for me, the ending left me wanting for some other explanation. Still, I will read Mr. Child's next. Jack Reacher is getting to be a cult figure!	2001-11-21

This is a fantastic, in every sense of the word, mystery series. Mostly all the players are introduced in this first book. I am glad I began at the beginning. Eve Dallas is our fiesty detective heroine, braving thru personal and professional hurdles.  She investigates everyone in her search for the killer and finally gets around to Roarke as a suspect.  Eve is relentless and dedicated and this attracts Roarke fiercely.<br />Their first meeting and subsequent confrontations are superbly written by Nora.  I enjoyed it more the second time because I knew where it was going.  You know almost from the beginning who the real murderer is but the voyage to the end is great.  <br />All the other characters are keenly written (Charles and Summerset are particular favorites) but they are all developed so well, you just cannot wait to get to the next installment.  Enjoy!	2001-11-14

It's a little more sadistic whan I like but I hung in there. I knew Reacher would win out! What a guy! Was afraid it would turn into a romance novel but it seemed to be ok.

A very young girl is discovered floating in a pond shot in the head, wearing only one shoe.  Good beginning to a mystery. This is my first Parker read outside of Spenser. Jesse was likable.  An ageing boy of summer with a good heart. Parker's compact dialogue between cops was very amusing. Jesse's relationship with his ex-wife was exasperating but, tied with his alcoholic baggage, it was understandable. Jesse did not have a Hawk or a Joe Pike to lean on.  Too bad.  I read this in one long afternoon watching football. Mr Parker can always be counted on for a decent read.	2001-11-04

The premise was cute. Theo Buchanan is receiving an award, has an appendix almost rupture and throws up on a beautiful woman who asks if she could help him.<BR>She turns out to be a doctor and the book takes off.  It's a bit over the top in some spots but I enjoyed this fast reading book.  The cover is interesting, the romance sweet and the FBI solving a crime was pretty good.

This is a very quick read, minute by minute excitement. I believe someone said it will be a Bruce Willis movie. I will be interested to see how they work around all the four, five, six letter blue words.  But it suits the book.

Teenagers were turning up missing in this little town and Sheriff Miranda Knight calls in the FBI profilers to help her with the case.  FBI's premier profiler, Noah Bishop, is an old 'friend' of the Sheriff's and the story goes from there.  Pretty interesting.

I expected a little more suspense and was surprised that this was a hardcover.  \\"A Game of Chance\\" had more suspense and a better romance.  But this was an amusing read. It definitely moved right along. It seems Linda added a golden retriever since it worked so well for Janet Evanovich but what the heck, it was a nice weekend read.  These kinds of books belong in paperback.	2001-10-05

In fact, I got the audio for my ride back and forth to work.  It took a while but I got into the story pretty fast.  Witty dialogue. Bernie and Carolyn were an interesting 'couple'.  I loved the similarity to &quot;And Then There Were None' (a black and white film that was the best version - look for it in your video store), Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler. Altho there were some discouraging reviews I will try another Lawrence Block 'Burglar' soon. With all the air travel that I do, I may just get another audio and block out reality for a while enroute.	2001-10-01

I picked this paperback up at a book sale and found it to be a quick, easy, fast-paced predictable fun read.  The chase scenes were the best with some good sex thrown in for interest, I suppose.  The misspelling of some words were distracting, they used the letter f for the letter t and I tried to ignore it.  It was a pretty good police procedural and quite the page turner. It might be too naive for some of you hard-boiled mystery buffs, but it was not a waste of time.  I might even look for Cold, Cold Heart and compare.	2001-09-27

The drinking problem upset me a little but it fit.  I read this book in two evenings and hated to put it down the first evening.  The bad guy was scary (arent they all). The twists and turns of the plot were excellent. Realistically, things like this do happen and thank God we have people out there who fight these maniacs for us, much to their own danger.

When I want a quick, exciting read, I turn to him. And he usually delivers. This one is totally 'out there', but so entertaining you can't put it down. Just because the shooter is a 60ish y.o. woman with money and connections (good ones) you have to make believe this could really happen. Her son is killed and thrown into a cement mixer and she goes after the Sons of Erin who did him in. Aiding her is her loyal chauffeur and friend, Hedley. This guy is one mean dude; she couldnt get along without him. Sean Dillon and crew are there to add to the mix. Great, good fun. Stop looking for the Book of Life. This was one good time!	2001-09-18

Karen Robards tale about a Country Western singer and the DEA agent who saves both their lives in a rather chilling, exciting chase was very good.<BR>Andrea Kane's story about an inheritance that really messes up a family plan was interesting.<BR>Linda Anderson's tale about a small town librarian and the handsome professor boarding at her mother's Bed and Breakfast was scary and chilling. I was kept guessing for a period of time on who the bad guy was. Mariah Stewart's story I found was the weakest. It just did not do it for me.

Every description is vivid and you feel tremendously throughout the whole book. Claire is now a doctor which comes in very handy for everyone. The humor and love between these two is so wonderful to read. They get into so much trouble you CANNOT put the book down until you see them safely out of it! :) I cannot believe how fast I read the first 3 and now will begin the fourth.

Altho it was amusing, it was not as hilarious at Mary's story.  It is however enjoyable, and you root for Annie and Joe (especially Joe) all the way thru. Joe's faimily is a riot. Ethic humor is great; Joe is delicious and Annie was a tug at a mother's heartstrings (and patience). Altho 15 years was a long time for them to finally get together, and Joe's leaving the priesthood was a bit too quick and easy for reality, everything turned out the way one would expect this type of book to end.  A nice, comfortable read for a rainy afternoon.	2001-08-13

If you can put this book down willingly, you are a stronger person than I.  Her descriptions are excellent. Pay attention to all the characters for this is not just one story.  Very emotional.  It will tie you in knots.  (pleasant knots).	2001-07-07

The sexual banter (down and dirty)between Sam and Jaine was very funny and not mean spirited. You will laugh out loud. The 4 friends were great and the mystery was easy to solve. Believe me, we would all want a neighbor like Sam!	2001-07-05

Locale descriptions along with Alex's friends were very good. Alex is not a perfect hero but his heart is in the right place.(right next to his persoanl bullet)! Some of the characters, especially Sylvia, had cloudy backgrounds but maybe Steve will see fit to share more in upcoming books. Will definitely read more of his books.	2001-07-05

Excellent reading. Dennis has a way with words and characters. The dialogue is dry and great! I can hear the Boston neighborhoods! Loved all the characters and especially Bubba who is a hoot! I will have to save &quot;Mystic River&quot; for another time. It's a little too dark for me. But I hear it is great. Congrats, Dennis!	2001-07-05
