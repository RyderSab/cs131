The global business environment has gone through numerous upheavals over the past five years, with the bursting of the technology / Internet bubble, outsourcing, and the growing dominance of mega-retailers, and the pace of change has never appeared greater.  In \\"Confronting Reality\\", Bossidy and Charan attempt to offer new rules for succeeding in this changed environment.  For the most part, their prescriptions appear very reasonable, although the book lacks detail in both its guidelines and the supporting evidence for them. <br /> <br />The main thesis of \\"Confronting Reality\\" is that business leaders should thoroughly examine their company's business model, focus on making money, and change the business model (perhaps radically) if conditions in the external environment demand it.  Without claiming that particular businesses have implemented their framework (after all, how could that be, since they are describing the framework for the first time in this book), they present a number of success cases and make the claim that the leaders of these companies have adhered to their guidelines.  This, of course, is more than a bit subjective, and would fail the standards of mathematical proof and the scientific method.  Furthermore, the description of the framework lacks detail, so it is not possible to know if a given company is adhering to it or not. <br /> <br />However, the recommendations Bossidy and Charan make seem beneficial.  Looking outside the company at how the external environment is changing should prevent companies from becoming too insular and from missing major market moves.  It is usually the case that when a once-successful business fails, it is due to some environmental change that becomes obvious to outside observers well before the company's leaders finally realize it and act upon it.  Bossidy and Charan present Sun Microsystems as a case of a company that missed a structural change in the environment, but even they aren't quite ready to write Sun off yet.  They heap praise on the job Jeffrey Immelt has done so far at GE (as well as Bob Nardelli at Home Depot), and strongly claim that those leaders are adhering to their guidelines, so if GE and Home Depot do well in the years ahead, it will be the best proof that their recommendations have value. <br /> <br />\\"Confronting Reality\\" can be read in a single cross-country plane flight.  The vocabulary is none too challenging, and the footnotes are so sparse as to cause me to wonder why the authors bothered including any at all.  Anecdotal stories are sprinkled throughout the book, and they hold the reader's attention.  \\"Confronting Reality\\" is a decent high-level overview of the changes roiling businesses and industries in the early 21st century, and can be a good book to start a discussion of these topics within a company.  But if you are looking for detailed answers and guidance, you will have to continue your search.	2005-06-14

Isaacson does a superb job of not only documenting Franklin's direct contributions to various key events, but also describes how he influenced the thoughts and writings of other contemporaries, such as Thomases Paine and Jefferson.  Through his writings, his accomplishments, and his life story, Ben Franklin has touched the lives of more people than has any other American.  Isaacson's book will see to it that this continues to be true.  Every American citizen who considers him/herself an educated person should study Ben Franklin, and Isaacson's book is a wonderful way for present day Americans to do so. <br /> <br />Although Walter Isaacson's well-researched and extensively footnoted book is fairly lengthy, I found myself wanting to know more about many of the events in Franklin's life, especially his scientific accomplishments.  Isaacson, the former managing editor of Time magazine, at times settles for a Time-like summarized description, rather than a New Yorker-like unconstrained dissertation.  Given Franklin's many accomplishments, this is (regretfully) necessary in order to prevent the book from expanding to multiple volumes.  After all, as shown by some of the sources Isaacson cites, entire books have been written about months-long periods of Franklin's life, and academics at Yale are finishing up a 40 volume collection of Franklin's writings.  All in all, Isaacson does an admirable job of presenting Franklin's life story in one volume.  His writing is engaging, and his vocabulary and sentence structure are not at all too academic, which makes for a very pleasurable read. <br /> <br />Over a long and mostly happy lifetime, Benjamin Franklin compiled an amazing list of accomplishments.  He was a true Renaissance man, operating at the leading edge of a wide variety of endeavors.  He was a skilled businessman, inventor, scientist, writer, founder of institutions, and politician / diplomat.  Knowledge has advanced since Franklin's time, and the world is a more crowded and complicated place, so mankind will likely never again see the likes of a Benjamin Franklin.  Walter Isaacson's book brings the 18th century Benjamin Franklin to life in the 21st, and for that we can be grateful.	2005-05-28

Rest assured, the John Edwards who wrote Telecosmos is almost assuredly not the multimillionaire trial attorney who ran on the undercard of the Democratic ticket for US President in 2004.  This John Edwards is a journalist with a lifelong delight in and passion for advances in telecommunications technology.  This passion was no doubt requisite in order for him to compile the material for this book (some of which is truly esoteric).  A similar passion is also a requirement for the reader, in order to make it to the end. <br /> <br />Telecosmos does not live up to the potential it could have achieved because John Edwards misses the opportunity to create a book that appeals to and inspires the masses.  He is correct in his main thesis, which is that the telecom bust the industry has endured from 2000 to 2004 is but a pause in the long-term advancement of communications technology, products and services.  The telecom industry is far from mature (we don't even have widespread video telephony, as first shown at the 1964 World's Fair), and there are major advances coming in the future, as soon as they can be moved from the lab to the real world. <br /> <br />But instead of presenting a coherent vision for what this future will look like (which admittedly would be hard for a journalist to do), Telecosmos pretty quickly turns into a survey of government funded telecom research projects.  Reading Telecosmos is a bit like reading one NSF grant abstract after another, with very little overall context in which to fit everything together.  Some of the research projects overlap with each other, but because Edwards is not a world-class telecom expert, he takes each project's stated aims at face value, and doesn't attempt to pick winners or losers.  Furthermore, because the book was hurriedly assembled in order to be maximally topical, it contains a fair number of typographical errors and other small factual errors. <br /> <br />Telecom industry insiders have watched Bell Labs, formerly the nation's premier research institute, slowly be dismantled over the past 20 years due to the ongoing breakup of AT&T.  Much of the \\"pure\\" and \\"applied\\" research formerly done at Bell Labs is now done within the confines of our nation's research universities, and many former Bell Labs scientists have joined the faculties of academic institutions.  So today, to learn what future telecom technologies may make their appearance in products over the next 10 to 20 years, John Edwards is correct to focus on what is happening in academia. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  if you are only mildly interested in the latest telecommunications technology, you are likely to find Telecosmos to be too dry and detailed.  If, however, you are in the telecommunications industry and would benefit from reading a survey of many of the most advanced telecom-related projects underway in academia, then Telecosmos is a reasonable book to read, flaws and all.	2005-01-12
US	39563054	R2WKFWNBLS25ML	0060740647	974040438	Running Money: Hedge Fund Honchos, Monster Markets and My Hunt for the Big Score	Books	4	9	10	N	Y	If you're smarter than Kessler, then why aren't you richer?	\\"Running Money\\" picks up where Andy Kessler's previous book, \\"Wall Street Meat\\" (which portrays his life as a Wall Street-based semiconductor industry stock analyst and investment banker), left off.  Kessler left Wall Street to run a Palo Alto-based hedge fund with one partner, raising money from wealthy individuals and groups, and investing it in latter-stage startup and public technology companies.  He had the, in retrospect, incredibly fortuitous timing (as he himself admits) to open a five year fund in 1996, which forced him to liquidate the fund and lock in his profits as the tech bubble was bursting in 2001 (in fact, he disperses his last cash just days before 9/11). <br /> <br />But Kessler's success, as he proves in the highly entertaining and also thought provoking \\"Running Money\\", is not merely the product of providential timing.  His insider's view of the hedge fund industry shows how many of these funds don't even attempt to do fundamental stock analysis, but instead seek out market distortions that they can profit from (for a while, at least).  Kessler, by contrast, stays true to his stock analyst roots and attempts to find great companies possessing a strong economic and technological advantage in a market about to undergo rapid growth.  He struggles initially, but eventually uses an interesting combination of old world thinking (by analyzing the history of the steam power-driven Industrial Revolution) and radical new era economics (described below) to identify some winners.  His story of the small niche semiconductor company he found which benefited immensely from the MP3 music piracy fad, at the same time that Napster and the record companies were losing their shirts, is a great case study for technology investing. <br /> <br />If \\"Running Money\\" were nothing more than a series of case studies and anecdotes about the investments Kessler made, it would be a fairly lightweight book.  The anecdotes are indeed amusing, especially Nick Moore's scathing trashtalking of technology companies (Moore has a humorous nickname for every technology company, e.g. \\"Scam-azon\\").  But fortunately, in the final section, Kessler ponders the deeper question of what his success means about the current economy. It is here that Kessler voices some fairly radical opinions and theories that certainly deserve to get discussed and tested. <br /> <br />Kessler's radical opinion is that traditional economists, who are very cognizant of and worried about the trade deficit that the United States has been running since the 1970s, are not properly accounting for what truly matters in today's economy:  wealth and profits.  Because so much US manufacturing has moved abroad, and because the design of those products (i.e. the intellectual property) is still heavily centered in the US, the US does not receive any economic \\"credit\\" on the trade balance sheet when those designs are shipped to overseas factories.  What is counted, of course, are the manufactured products that come back into this country, and that produces a large deficit.  But since manufacturing is such a cutthroat business, whereas companies focused on developing intellectual property (e.g. Microsoft, Intel, pharmaceutical companies, and even Nike) command such high margins (profits) and pay their employees well, the resulting arrangement is highly beneficial to the living standard of the US.  \\"We think, they sweat\\", sums up Kessler in his typical smart-alecky style.  The low-priced products which flow into this country, along with the capital which finances some of our government's budget deficit, are our rewards for this mutually beneficial relationship.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, these views are highly controversial.  Yet Kessler forcefully states his arguments, and also has more than a little evidence on his side.  He deserves credit for formulating these views, and thereby making \\"Running Money\\" more than just a breezy rags-to-riches technology boom era story.	2005-01-01
US	39563054	R1PL3K9XZ14NOD	0618357092	626635633	The Best American Essays 2004 (The Best American Series)	Books	5	12	15	N	Y	22 tasty, nourishing servings of brain food	\\"The Best American Short Stories\\" may be more popular, but \\"The Best American Essays\\" anthology is an even better choice for readers seeking the utmost in nourishment for the brain.  The twenty-two selections chosen by Louis Menand, which cover a wide variety of topics, are all exceedingly well written, mind expanding, and, to a high degree, personal, in that they reveal something about the author as well as the subject matter.  In spite of the two minor flaws of Menand's selections (discussed below), this collection will definitely reward the reader seeking substantive reading material. <br /> <br />The two most powerful essays in the book are two of the most personal.  Kathryn Chetkovich's \\"Envy\\" pulls no punches in her analysis of how she reacted to the success experienced by her boyfriend and fellow writer, Jonathan Franzen, who rocketed to literary stardom in 2001 with \\"The Corrections\\".  Interestingly, Chetkovich doesn't name Franzen, but Menand chose also to include an essay by him (\\"Caught\\"), which, although interesting, doesn't have the same emotional depth or power as Chetkovich's essay.  The other extraordinary essay in the collection is Laura Hillenbrand's \\"A Sudden Illness\\", which describes her incredible struggle with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Her personal story is every bit as poignant as the story of the racehorse Seabiscuit, which she chronicled in her best-selling book. <br /> <br />Other essays of note, I feel, include Luc Sante's \\"My Lost City\\", which actually celebrates the crime-ridden, graffiti-covered, anarchic, decaying, pre-Rudy Giuliani New York of the 1980s, and Oliver Sacks' \\"The Mind's Eye\\", which describes differences in the extent to which several blind people use visualization techniques, thereby illustrating the power of (and structural differences among) human brains. <br /> <br />As for the minor complaints:  Menand openly admits, \\"I like to read stories about my own times.\\"  This bias shows up most obviously in the inclusion ofan essay by a CUNY colleague of Menand's:  Wayne Koestenbaum's \\"My `80s\\" will likely not at all resemble your `80s unless you are a NYC opera buff who kept up with the cutting edge of male homosexual intelligentsia literature.  The other complaint is that a small number of essays exhibit the stereotypical upper West side salon superior-than-though attitude which sneers at red state values and culture (e.g. Fox News).  Of course, if you are of a similar opinion, this won't bother you a bit.  However, one essay takes this attitude to completely illogical extremes:  Jared Diamond's \\"The Last Americans\\", which somehow claims a linkage between Enron's financial shenanigans and global warming (hey, it's all George Bush's fault, right?).  Diamond's essay will leave some readers fuming and others shaking their heads, while still others applaud, but it will cause all readers to think, as do all the essays in this collection.  Thus, Menand has created a collection well worth spending the time to read and ponder.	2004-12-31

First, let me state that I always recommend both the \\"Best American\\" and \\"O. Henry\\" annual short story anthologies to anyone with a modicum of interest in present-day American literature.  By reading these volumes, you get exposed to a wide variety of some (but by no means all) of the best stories by some of our best writers (or at least those writers who produce in the short story format).  A well-written short story is an easily consumed treat that also teaches something new about the human condition.  Given the time constraints of modern-day life, it's surprising that short stories are not more popular.  But certainly these anthologies deserve a wide audience. <br /> <br />I will also warn that, since interpreting works of art is subjective, others will have different reactions to the stories in this volume.  My interpretation of the choices that Lorrie Moore made in putting this volume together was that she erred on the side of including instantly recognizable (but therefore not terribly innovative) stories by well-known authors, as well as including lengthier selections.  Although the selections are made blind, without knowledge of the author's name, the pieces by Edward P. Jones, Alice Munro, Annie Proulx, John Updike, Mary Yukari Waters and John Edgar Wideman are all very recognizable via their subject matter and writing styles.  Length, meanwhile, negates two of the main attributes of a good short story:  brevity and pithiness.  E.B. White, who always advocated using as few words as possible to communicate an idea, would not be pleased with all of Moore's selections. <br /> <br />My favorite story in the 2004 volume is Thomas McGuane's \\"Gallatin Canyon\\", a true masterpiece of a short story written in the O. Henry style.  Not a word is wasted, and every seemingly innocent or minor event quickly builds towards a life-or-death conclusion that exposes the nature of the main characters.  It is a model for how to apply the classical short story form in the 21st century.  The most innovative story is Stuart Dybek's \\"Breasts\\", which is truly (as Lorrie Moore so well characterizes) a Quentin Tarantino film transformed into short story format.  However, like a Tarantino film, after all the violence has ended and the last joke has been played out, I find myself asking \\"yes, but what is the point?\\".  Other notable stories, I felt, were T. Coraghessan Boyle's suspenseful modern day working-class romance \\"Tooth and Claw\\", and Edward P. Jones' \\"A Rich Man\\", which presents a view into the culture of  inner-city Washington D.C. that has produced, among other things, the TV images of Mayor Marion Barry smoking a crack pipe. <br /> <br />My least favorite stories in this volume were Trudy Lewis's \\"Limestone Diner\\", which I felt was instantly forgettable, and, I'm sad to say, Annie Proulx's \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\".  Normally I really enjoy Ms. Proulx's work, but I felt that in this story she was just painting by the numbers, by invoking too many clichs:  the Vietnam War as a conscious-raising event, the evil energy companies who are even more damaging to the environment than cattle-herding ranchers, and even a homosexual son who falls for the beefcake ranch hand. <br /> <br />All in all, the 2004 edition of the Best American Short Stories serves up a wide variety of different slices of present-day American life.  While not the best volume in the series, it is well worth reading. <br />	2004-11-26
US	39563054	R2ZOKXPMN78CQV	0670820555	532141883	Spy Catcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer	Books	5	78	78	N	N	The ultimate insider's view of Britain's MI5	Reading \\"Spycatcher\\", I was continually struck by this thought:  how was it possible for Peter Wright to publish a book which exposes so much of the internal operations of Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence/security service?  He names names, describes personalities in often unflattering terms, and details what were surely the most sensitive of investigations undertaken by MI5.  What may be MI5's loss is the public's gain, as we get a rare glimpse at the very heart of a (by definition) highly secretive agency, charged with ensuring the security and continuance of one of the Western world's greatest democracies.<br /><br />Wright is undoubtedly a brilliant man, as are his colleagues (Wright describes how one of them does crossword puzzles completely in his head).  Although the book opens with his retirement day, in which he shreds his diaries, he is somehow able to reconstruct the minutest details of operations that span his 20-year career with MI5, from the mid-50s to mid-70s, as well as critical pre-World War II events that he investigated for MI5.  Wright is a radio engineer by training and original profession, and he joins MI5 as their first scientist in order to bring the benefits of technology to the agency.  As MI5's top scientist, he is immediately charged with carrying out their most sensitive bugging and eavesdropping operations, which indoctrinates him into MI5's most secretive activities.  Eventually, he leaves scientific advocacy behind to assume a role hunting down suspected Soviet spies within MI5 itself.<br /><br />Although Wright has many successes, he is never able to fully prove his most shocking assertion, which is that Roger Hollis, the head of MI5 for many years (and Wright's superior), was a Soviet spy.  The circumstantial evidence Wright presents, however, is very convincing.  Wright's analysis and the logic he applies are impressive because he not only looks at the various events themselves, but he constantly considers how events would have unfolded differently if his thesis were untrue.<br /><br />\\"Spycatcher\\" is a fascinating book, for many reasons.  First of all, it takes the reader deeper within an actual government intelligence agency than almost any spy novel, and it has the added benefit of being true.  The case against Hollis, and other spies exposed by Wright and his compatriots at MI5, serves as a warning about the fragility of security agencies:  a few well-placed enemy spies can destroy massive amounts of work.  Many of these top-level spies recruited by the Soviets were left-wing students at Britain's finest universities (Oxford and Cambridge), which shows how ideology expressed in an academic environment can lead to radical behavior and revolutionary actions.  However, spying on potential domestic subversives is not a pleasant task, as Wright himself admits.  \\"Spycatcher\\" also shows the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K., which is not without its tensions.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Spycatcher\\" illustrates the need to fight back using many of the tactics of the enemy, however despicable they may be.  Intelligence work is not pretty:  it involves tapping communications, breaking and entering, planting agents, soliciting defectors (using whatever might best appeal to them), and trying to detect and eliminate the enemy's spies before they do the same to yours.  And in the end, the intelligence information received may be completely wrong, either because of the motives of the agents who provided it (who may be double agents), or because it is the product of an enemy disinformation campaign. However, if the U.K. and U.S. had not played the spy game against the Soviets, they would have put the countries at serious risk.  Winning the intelligence game is not easy, but this was definitely an important front during the Cold War in Wright's day, and the war on terror today.  The Soviets had an active disinformation campaign during the Cold War; in fact, one of the more spectacular assertions of Wright's is that the Cuban missile crisis was a Soviet disinformation exercise to distract attention from their long-range missile development programs.  As \\"Spycatcher\\" proves, the intelligence game is like a hall or mirrors - you're never sure if you're seeing something real or something which is exactly backwards.  But, it is still important to attempt to play the game as best as one can.	2004-11-07

He is old enough to have known Alfred Sloan of General Motors, and was a studious observer of the rise of the modern corporation, all the way through to its present most advanced state, the post-industrial knowledge-based corporation.  Furthermore, Drucker has made major contributions over the decades to management theory and practice, through his books, teaching, consulting, and many articles in publications such as the Harvard Business Review.  He has studied a broad span of management topics, from organizational behavior to individual behavior to the impact of organizations and businesses on society.  He is even a bit of a futurist.  So, who better to have one's life work collected into a single volume, to provide an overview of 20th century management theory? <br /> <br />\\"The Essential Drucker\\" (TED) is definitely worth reading, for anyone with a modicum of interest in organizational management.  For someone like myself, with a good number of years in business, it served as an excellent refresher course and validated many of my own beliefs about management, and the teachings that I've received through other channels.  Drucker's writings are the antithesis of faddish, flaky management theories; he advocates a very solid, non-flashy, heads-down, customer and results focused approach to management that also manages to be humane.  There are so many nuggets of wisdom sprinkled throughout TED that I would not be doing justice to the book to highlight only a few of them.  One impression that comes across strongly, reading thoughts that Drucker put to paper decades ago, is just how true and applicable they are today. <br /> <br />Having heaped much praise on Drucker and TED, I'm obligated to point out the book's major flaw, which is a function of the way it was put together.  Drucker has produced so much writing on so many topics that it isperhaps an impossible task to condense the highlights into a single volume, and still retain anything close to the full force of his arguments.  Reading TED, it appears that what most often was edited out (but not always, to be fair) was the evidence (anecdotal or otherwise) in support of his theories.  You still get the theories and the declarative statements, but what is often missing is the supporting evidence and examples of the application of the theories, to provide a proper context.  A veteran manager can supply these from one's own personal experience, as I was often able to do, but I feel that inexperienced readers, such as the students who Drucker claims are part of the target audience for TED, might struggle with the book. <br /> <br />Given that Drucker and his editor decided to make a single volume rather than two or three, TED is a worthwhile summary of a lifetime's work from a great management thinker, and a decent overall survey of 20th century management theory and practices. <br />	2004-10-21

Jeffrey Eugenides accomplishes many feats in \\"Middlesex\\", the most significant being that he manages to be completely convincing writing in the first person as a hermaphrodite.  But Middlesex is not at all a freak show.  Eugenides skillfully uses the narrator's hermaphrodite condition to craft a unique story of the assimilation of 20th century immigrants to America.  Eugenides' ultimate aim is to show the degree to which society impacts the individual, and he succeeds admirably.  You don't at all have to be a hermaphrodite or a Greco-American to identify with the lessons in Middlesex. <br /> <br />The author Cal/Calliope's condition is caused by a single mutant gene, but because of society's gender norms and the influence of family members, friends, strangers, educators, and the medical profession, the impact of that one mutant gene is immense (literally, life and death), far exceeding the actual physical impact on Cal/Calliope's body.  Middlesex is a plea for tolerance and acceptance, and Eugenides proves his case by illustrating what happens when those ideals are violated.  Even for those characters that are not hermaphrodites (such as Cal's brother, who gets caught up in the sixties anti-war counterculture), society also plays a heavy role in determining one's actions and fates.  Any self-aware reader who possesses at least one \\"outside the norm\\" condition (and who among us does not?) will identify on that abstract level with Cal. <br /> <br />Eugenides, writing as Cal/Calliope, manages to give proper voice to both his male and female sides.  The supporting characters in Middlesex are a very interesting, memorable collection of personalities.  The book is a fairly quick read, and the ending is especially fast paced and gripping.  So, what is the flaw that prevents me from giving Middlesex a five star rating?  Simply this:  the first half of the book, up to the moment of Cal's birth, is not nearly as absorbing or consequential as the second half, which focuses onCal's life and gradual discovery of his/her gender and preferences, which precipitates the book's main themes.  Eugenides intends the first half to be more than just the set-up for Cal's story, but I feel if he had restricted himself to simply that purpose, he would have created a shorter but even more powerful, moving story. <br /> <br />All in all, I do recommend Middlesex, but even though it won the Pulitzer, I don't think it is going to go down in literary history as a classic. <br />	2004-10-04

William Kennedy has not achieved his stated aim with \\"O Albany!\\":  I do not think that people in Kansas City, with no particular interest in learning about Albany, will enjoy \\"O Albany!\\" more than Mr. Kennedy's fiction works sited in that city.  However, for passionate Kennedy fans interested in learning about his novels' settings, and for anyone with an interest in learning about Albany (more likely a broader audience), \\"O Albany!\\" is recommended, with some minor hesitations.    \\"O Albany!\\" is a quirky history.  To its credit, it most definitely is not a dispassionate, straightforward, chronological history (that would be too dry, and would waste Kennedy's storytelling talents).  Instead, \\"O Albany!\\" is the author's own anecdotal, personal, episodic slice of Albany's history.  Kennedy covers many salient aspects, but plumbs certain subjects too deeply (such as the neighborhoods, and his tendency to cite too many names of people and businesses - this makes for some tedious reading) while only touching upon certain episodes of the lives of more interesting subjects (e.g. Legs Diamond, and the Barnes Republican machine, which preceded the O'Connell Democratic machine with which Kennedy is naturally more acquainted).    The best parts of \\"O Albany!\\" are Kennedy's freeform reminiscences about his boyhood neighborhood, and the profiles of the Albany Democratic machine and the shady, corrupt dealings (at all levels, from the governor on down) that were done in order to, slowly and expensively, erect the South Mall.  These are far from the only shady dealings described, however.  The Albany Democratic party comes across as a cross between the Communists (because of their absolute single-party dominance, and the power of the unelected party chief) and the Mafia.  Kennedy offers some reasons why Albany has tolerated this situation, but since he does not lament what Albany would otherwise be (perhaps, a city of more wealth and energy, especially in the private and creative sectors), a critic might call him an apologist.  But, although Kennedy has chosen Albany for his home, he does point out the many warts, so he accepts Albany for what it is without being blind to its faults.    Albany has a much more interesting history than I was expecting.  It has an image as a drab city dominated by government and its minions of risk-avoiding job-for-life 9-to-5 bureaucrats.  The past, and how it came to be the city that it is now, however, is much livelier, and Kennedy captures this in his book.    p.s.

Books	4	5	9	N	N	Classical liberalism for the masses	With \\"Give Me a Break!\\", John Stossel has performed a valuable public service:  applying classical liberal thinking to present day social, economic and political issues, and packaging the results in a form that can be easily understood by the masses. <br /> <br />Stossel resists labeling himself:  at one point, he says he's not a libertarian (he most definitely is) because he's not enticed by the Libertarian party and one of their nominees for NY governor, Howard Stern.  However, this is exactly like confusing being democratic with supporting the Democratic party.  Stossel is a classical liberal, believing in a high degree of freedom in both social and economic spheres.  This stands in stark contrast to present day nanny state, welfare state, big government liberalism, and also certain aspects of conservatism.  As Stossel describes in GMAB, he has weathered many attacks from the liberals who dominate the US's traditional media (the broadcast networks and big city daily newspapers). <br /> <br />After a short perfunctory biographical section, Stossel describes the evolution of his thinking that led him from being a highly decorated corporate attack dog consumer journalist to someone who began to see the bigger picture and the damage that is done when consumers' freedom is restricted by the government, which ultimately relies upon force to subvert the freewill of the people.  Stossel discusses a broad range of issues, from business licensing to drug policy.  I enjoyed most his chapter is on the damage done by lawyers:  Stossel describes how they have usurped the legislature's power to raise taxes (e.g. the cigarette lawsuit settlement boondoggle and boon, to certain superrich, politically-connected lawyers) and how lawyers and judges make safety and medical decisions formerly left to scientists, doctors, the people's elected representatives, and individual consumers choosing what is best for themselves. <br /> <br />Stossel provides many examples to illustrate his points, although the most serious charge that can be leveled against him is that he occasionally uses selective and anecdotal evidence.  More often than not, however, he tries to cite broad statistical and scientific evidence. <br /> <br />GMAB is written in very simple language, to appeal to the masses.  The main service Stossel has performed with GMAB is to take ideas developed by original thinkers, cite a wealth of real-world evidence in support of those ideas, and package it all in a form that can likely be understood by the average high school graduate.  GMAB is a very good introduction to classical liberal thinking. If you want an even more passionate exposition of these ideas, read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, or if you want a deeper, more original discussion, read the writers Stossel cites.  But at a minimum, read GMAB. <br />	2004-09-11

AAAD is the first of a planned trilogy, with forthcoming books focusing on Italy and then the drive across France to Berlin. <br /> <br />Atkinson, a journalist, restrains himself from too many editorial comments, focusing instead on a straightforward description of the facts of the various battles and strategies.  His main indulgence is a propensity to point out the flaws in almost every battle plan, which (if he is correct) produced many unnecessary casualties.  One of the main strengths of AAAD is that Atkinson looks at the war from all levels, from FDR & Churchill puffing on their smokes and pontificating after a four course dinner served on fine linen and china, to the sleep deprived shell-shocked infantryman on the front lines.  Atkinson's heart lies with the soldier in the trenches, which is a completely reasonable place to put his sympathies. <br /> <br />I most enjoyed the various war strategy discussions, especially FDR & Churchill's momentous Casablanca Conference.  The strains experienced by the alliance, and the challenges of winning over the German-controlled Vichy French, who initially (and in some cases very bloodthirstily) fought the U.S. and U.K. armies who were trying to liberate them, were enlightening and have direct parallels in current world events.  There are many lessons from AAAD that can be applied not only to current events, but also to the world of business:  the challenges of getting people from different cultures to form cohesive teams, the importance of clear communication, the need to focus and concentrate one's forces, and the motivation required to get people to make huge sacrifices to achieve a goal.  My main complaint about AAAD is that I felt Atkinson spent a littletoo much time providing a blow-by-blow account of various battles and precisely how various hills were attacked:  this made the book somewhat slow going, and detracted from the other more important issues in the book. <br /> <br />I'm not at all familiar with the vast trove of World War II histories (an extensive bibliography is provided, and Atkinson does appear to have done exhaustive research, and quotes at length from soldier's diaries and letters), but I would say AAAD is deserving of the Pulitzer Prize for history.  World War II is a monumentally important event in U.S. history, and AAAD deserves to be read by American citizens seeking an understanding of how our country contributed to the liberation of Europe, and just what was required to do so.  As Atkinson says, it arguably is the greatest story of the 20th century. <br />	2004-08-13

Emphatically, positively, yes! <br />The Floating Opera serves as an excellent introduction to the body of work of one of the 20th century's greatest writers (time will tell), and also stands on its own as an engrossing, amusing, thought-provoking tale. It establishes many of Barth's common themes and settings: the flawed, cynical (yet also fun-loving) protagonist; impossible quests; the absurdities of society's structures and laws; philosophy and morality; coastal Maryland and boating on the Chesapeake. Barth's later works are longer and much more intricate, so TFO is very much like Beethoven's first symphony: a simpler work than his later masterpieces, but which still shows definite signs of genius, originality, and timelessness. <br />The storyline, like Barth's other works, is quirky and highly original. It describes the lead-up to an event that, because of the way the book was written (in the first person), the reader knows cannot have taken place. Barth openly explains the disjointed nature of the book's structure (which is just one way that the floating opera of the title is important to the story), and everything holds together in the end. <br />TFO's protagonist, Todd Andrews, is a lawyer who has developed a detached, cynical view of the world. His mentality is perfect for his profession, and he wins his cases by crafting intricate technical loopholes that reduce his cases to absurdities. Thirty-five years before the Johnnie Cochran's poetic words in the O.J. Simpson trial, Barth prophetically describes a similar situation of the &quot;bon mot&quot; winning out over the &quot;mot juste&quot;. But this is just one of the amusing vignettes in TFO. Barth also describes the challenges of an open love triangle, different ways to approach old age and death, the drawbacks of various outlooks on life, and an intense father-son relationship. Comic relief is never too far away, especially when the various crusty old men in the book are speaking. <br />\\"The End of the Road\\" shares a central plot element (a love triangle) with \\"The Floating Opera\\", but in TEOTR the relationship is about as far from consensual as can be, and as a result TEOTR is a very different, even more powerful story.  Barth crams a lot of substance into TEOTR, and it succeeds on multiple levels: as a compelling story with much for the reader to ponder, as a political statement (John Irving appears to me to have been inspired by the ending of TEOTR in his acclaimed \\"Cider House Rules\\"), and as applied philosophy, with religious undertones.<br /> \\"In a sense, I am Jacob Horner,\\" states Jacob Horner, the Barthian hero/anti-hero of TEOTR, at the very beginning of the story, but who is Jacob Horner (or whom does he represent)?  Jacob Horner may represent the ultimate modern man, a person who rejects objective, absolute truths in favor of relativism, and who is so imbued with knowledge that he can see all sides of any argument, contradiction or paradox.  At times Horner is completely paralyzed from acting, and at almost all other times his actions are timid to the extreme, such that he relies on \\"the Doctor\\", who prescribes nonsensical therapies to get Horner to take action, any action.  Horner's thought process has many parallels in today's society, especially leaders who can't make up their minds and waffle on the issues.  Horner suggests he may be the devil, but his logical thought process (his ability to see and accept opposite qualities in others, as in a love/hate relationship) suggests the \\"shades of gray\\", fuzzy logic thinking prevalent at all levels of modern society.<br />Joe Morgan, Horner's colleague, also believes only in relative values, and has even more formal education than Horner, but he hasdevised a philosophy which he believes tells him how to act in all situations.  Morgan, whom Horner suggests may be God, is the \\"black and white\\" thinker in contrast to Horner's gray, but his philosophy has holes that become obvious to all but him at the end.<br />TEOTR, while not Barth's greatest work, is everything a great piece of literature should be.  Barth creates fascinating characters drawn from the fabric of modern society, puts them through episodes of high drama, and produces outcomes that provide the fodder for debate about just what it all means.	2004-06-28

He had the good fortune to learn the ropes from an old school traditionalist, which allowed him both to be successful in the old fashioned sense (achieving a top analyst ranking, as determined by clients) and to understand the transition that happened in the 1990s, as analysts became more involved in investment banking and, in many cases, lost their bearings in the telecom/Internet boom and bust markets (Jack Grubman being the penultimate example).<br />What makes Kessler's book so powerful is that he calls it as he sees it, from his objective, fundamentally grounded insider's viewpoint.  He's made enough money, he's happy in his career, and he cares deeply about the future of Wall Street, so he's not out to perform character assassination; he truly wants to point out what went wrong (and does so in a very entertaining fashion) and make suggestions for reform.  He doesn't put much weight in additional regulations and prosecutions, believing that reputation is a more effective mechanism for ensuring proper behavior over the long term.  Rather, Kessler pushes structural economic reforms such as a \\"synthetic Goldman Sachs\\" in which stock research could be performed by truly independent, stand-alone entities (TheStreet.com isn't there yet, according to Kessler), and ending IPO lockups, to eliminate the huge post-IPO pops that happened during the boom and which led to such a frenzy of deal making.  The Dutch auction method for allocating and pricing IPO shares, which Google is using during its upcoming IPO, could also eliminate this problem.<br />WSM is a must read for Wall Streeters, and people involved in the financing of technology companies.  Individual investors (especially tech stock investors) would benefit greatly from reading WSM, to learn Kessler's cautionary tale of how the Street really worked during the boom, and what perversions remain.	2004-06-27

US	39563054	R137GUH9IKJYVO	0375726403	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Empires fall, but should you stay to be buried in rubble?	For those who, like myself, left a small city much like the fictional Empire Falls, Maine, to seek a better life in a larger metropolitan area, and also to escape from the small-town thinking that limits human potential, Richard Russo's Empire Falls presents an interesting counter study:  what is life like, today, in the old hometown?<br />The main strengths of Empire Falls lie in its character portraits (Miles' father Max in particular has an interesting outlook on life), and the description of the social structure of a small American city in decline.  Russo does an excellent job showing how people's place within the social structure gets established and enforced, and how people often get trapped by it, even though it is often within their power to improve their lot in life (this is especially true for Miles, who is submissive to a fault).  It is also interesting to see how deep, dark secrets get withheld from people who interact with each other continually.  Russo also presents some challenging questions about organized religion:  what is the morality of a senile, verbally abusive priest, a liberal homosexual priest, and a church that councils people to sacrifice their happiness so that they can suffer under the hands of others?  These questions don't get answered, but the situations described will stimulate thought in the minds of readers.<br />I have a few quibbles about the storyline, the main one being that it is hard to believe that Miles would not have come the realize the full identity of C.B. years before the story takes place.  Russo seems to have noted this objection, and pages later spends a paragraph trying to explain this.  Second, it is hard to figure out just how big a city Empire Falls is supposed to be.  The streets are constantly described as being nearly devoid of pedestrians, and the main characters are always running into each other, yet the city supports a Sunday edition of the local newspaper, even though there is a healthier college town seven miles away.  Finally, after the plot lopes along at a leisurely pace, the events of the ending come in rapid-fire succession, and one of the key events is directly lifted (and transported) from the headlines of the day.  Russo uses this event for good dramatic purposes, but it may very well prevent Empire Falls from becoming a classic novel, just as a story from the Sixties that transparently copied the Kent State shootings (but wasn't about Kent State) would today be viewed as dated.<br />All in all, I did not appreciate Empire Falls to the same degree as many other reviewers, and I am somewhat surprised it received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize, as I don't think it will be a terribly memorable book for me.  The structure of the story is very straightforward (realistic third-party descriptions of scenes, interspersed with flashbacks), and the symbolism and writing is none too subtle (as is proven by the title), so it doesn't break any new ground in literature.  It's a better than average read, and does have its moments, but I don't believe it's a classic piece of literature or the new Great American Novel.	2004-06-03

Menand is ultimately successful in his primary aim, which is to show how abstract philosophical ideas can have a major impact on the quality of life experienced by everyday people.<br />Menand's narrative path encompasses many side journeys, sometimes not appearing to advance towards the end goal, and it is not until the last seventh of the book that we get treated to an overall description of the philosophy of pragmatism. The doings of the Cambridge Metaphysical Club are briefly summarized almost halfway through the book, and the reader at that point learns that the club itself is not (although it is the title of the book) what made the major impact on society; rather, it is what some of the club's members did over the course of many subsequent decades that changed American society.<br />The great pleasure in reading The Metaphysical Club comes from following Menand on these many side journeys, thereby learning about a cornucopia of subjects, from the politics of slavery, abolition and the Civil War, to what pre-Civil War proper Boston Brahmin society was like, to the impact that Darwin's ideas on evolution had, to the Dartmouth College case and the founding of the modern private American university, to the Pullman car strike, to the initial battles to establish the principle of academic freedom, all underscored with a recurring discussion of race attitudes over the decades.  <br />If this list appears to be a bit of a grab-bag of subjects, that impression prevails while reading the book: although it is all connected, you never quite know what subject Menand is going to explore next.  The Metaphysical Club is not the final authority on any of these subjects; rather, it is a top-quality survey work.  The subtitle describes the book better than the title:  it truly is \\"a story of ideas in America\\".  It's not \\"the\\" definitive story; Menand is exercising his right to explore brief portions of subjects of interest to him and germane to the storyline.  But if you are willing to grant him this authorial license, and not protest the course he chooses, then you will be enthralled, entertained, and enlightened.<br />As a work of history (it won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for history), Menand also succeeds in providing a great deal of context about the state of the world his subjects were living in, so that we 21st century readers can \\"see how almost unimaginably strange they and their world were, too.\\"  While there are certain timeless truths that were generated by these thinkers, it is also instructive to see just how much they were a product of their times, which (of course) applies equally as well to us, today.	2004-05-09

His best films (\\"Roxanne,\\" \\"L.A. Story\\") are warm, funny, uplifting portraits of regular (okay, slightly irregular) folks.  I enjoyed \\"Shopgirl\\", finding it to be a touching true-to-life story of people connecting amidst the paradoxical loneliness of life in a crowded modern day American city (Shopgirl has the potential to make a very good movie).  \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" explores similar themes, yet since the main character is so obviously mentally disturbed, I could not develop a deep attachment or identification with him, which prevented the story from affecting me as deeply as Martin's best work.<br />Although almost everyone has episodes of shyness, which handicap them from directly obtaining the object of their desires, the protagonist of TPOMC handicaps himself to such extremes that it is hard for the reader to know how to react.  Martin spends a significant portion of the book describing these self-afflictions, in painful detail in many cases.  Some of them are terribly sad, some are just plain stupid, and some are quite funny (my favorite was when the main character decides, for several days, to avoid saying any words with the letter \\"E\\" in them - the slightly convoluted sentences that he devises to converse with others who don't know about this self-imposed limitation show off Martin's subtle humor at its best).  So, while humor is definitely one of Martin's intents, at other times I felt as if I was being asked to laugh at the truly mentally ill.  Or, more likely, Martin did want to invoke more complicated feelings of pathos in the reader.  But whatever his intent, it did prevent me from identifying with the main character, which in turn made it hard to apply the lessons from the book.<br />There are a few other more minor flaws in TPOMC.  There is a diversion in the plot whereby the main character enters an essay contest and gets invited tospeak at fictional \\"Freedom College\\", modeled after evangelical colleges here in the U.S.  Yet the essays submitted are so awful (as the main character states, every sentence in his essay contradicts the prior one) and the people at the college so wooden that Martin fails to concede even an iota of intelligence to the target of his satire.  But no one is that stupid, so it is too easy to dismiss the points Martin was trying to make.<br />TPOMC does have a redeeming message to convey: even a painfully shy, afflicted individual can, if they open their hearts widely to others and open their lives a tiny bit to social interaction, find a true, healing love.  And there are some warm and humorous passages.  However, for those who have not yet read any Steve Martin, I would recommend \\"Shopgirl\\" over TPOMC, and I would urge some caution before spending time and money on TPOMC.	2004-04-15

What makes TGC special is what it reveals about the lives of the poor and the working class in Mexico.  Those with an interest in Mexico's people will find TGC to be enlightening, poignant, and an engrossing read.<br />David Stuart chose the right profession when he decided to become an anthropologist - he loves observing his fellow man.  For reasons not entirely explained in the book (this is one of the minor deficiencies), he had a rough childhood, leading him to feel alienated from America and its people.  Instead, he finds his (apparently) ideal social network among the taxi drivers, bartenders, waitresses, prostitutes and street people of Guaymas.  Even though he tries, he can never fully fit in with these people because, as one of his friends tells him, he has too many options and choices in life that they, his Mexican friends, will never have.  But that doesn't prevent David Stuart from providing a fairly intimate look at how these people conduct their lives, how they find happiness, and how they respond to the challenges life presents them.<br />There are many lessons to be learned from TGC.  Life is much more fragile in Mexico, due to a poorer health care system.  We may complain about the cost of health care here in the U.S., and push health care to a somewhat dubious extreme (cosmetic surgery and botox injections), but this book shows the cost of not having a good health care system.  Moral choices do have significant consequences; in TGC, several instances of promiscuity have severe results.  And yet, through it all, most all of the Mexicans that David Stuart meets find enjoyment in life, primarily through warm-hearted social interactions and support networks.  There are lessons that we in the U.S. can learn from Mexicans.	2004-04-07

He is not a mindless stock cheerleader; in fact, his March 14, 2000 Wall Street Journal article entitled \\"Why Big Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker's Bet\\" persuasively pointed out how the high tech stock emperor had no clothes, and helped burst the insanely overvalued tech bubble.  This was at a time when the vast majority of Wall Street analysts were inventing new valuation methods to justify insane stock prices, while other more pessimistic analysts had declared an \\"irrational exuberance\\" years before the market actually topped.<br />\\"Stocks for the Long Run\\" is Siegel's seminal work (now in its third edition), an excellent introduction to investing for the average investor looking to save for retirement.  If the SEC were to choose one book to force people to read before they were allowed to invest their money in the stock market, this book would be it.  In fact, the people who lost their retirement money because it was all invested in one stock such as Enron or Worldcom (or a bunch of dot-coms), or who lost a fortune day trading when the market tanked, would have been so much better off if they had just read this book and applied its lessons.  They would be better off, the market would be much less volatile, the allocation of capital would be more efficient, the economy would be stronger, and the world would be a better place, if only more people would read this book.<br />\\"Stocks for the Long Run\\" gives you all the knowledge you need to implement a solid investment strategy.  Siegel educates and informs (this book will teach you all the basics you need to know to watch CNBC and to understand the market), and he packs his book with as much long-term data and supporting evidence as possible.  He is a firm believer in the scientific method and data; he does not posit recommendations unless they are firmly supported by historical evidence.<br />The good news in the third edition (post 1990s/2000 bubble) is that the case for investing in stocks is still a strong one.  Siegel presents extremely persuasive arguments why, long term, stocks hold their value and gain value better than any other type of investment (fundamentally, we must never lose sight of the fact that stocks are claims on real assets and the cash flows generated by enterprises).  Surprisingly, stocks are lower risk, long-term, than bonds.  Siegel presents some good arguments why stocks now deserve a higher-than-long-term-average P/E, but also shows how index investing (which he still heartily recommends) is distorting the market, and how our expectations for returns from stocks need to come down slightly.  He correctly identifies TIPS as the best investment for those seeking short-term safety.<br />Siegel's main argument is that investors should get into stocks in such a way as to match the overall return of the market, which will provide them with a healthy long-term return on investment.  He does show a number of ways to improve on that return and beat the market, such as by recognizing when the market is under and overvalued, thereby buying low and selling high.  Thus, I would recommend that a new investor first read, study and apply \\"Stocks in the Long Run\\", and then move on to Ben Stein's \\"Yes You Can Time the Market\\" as a way to optimize the lessons from \\"Stocks in the Long Run\\".	2004-03-12

I immensely enjoyed \\"No Way to Treat a First Lady\\", and found myself chuckling almost constantly throughout, laughing out loud many times, and laughing uncontrollably on several occasions.  If you read this book in public, as I did, be prepared to receive disapproving glances from others who aren't having as good a time as you are.<br />No Way skewers the Washington political scene, the legal profession, the media, and in particular the Clinton scandals and the O.J. Simpson trial.  But ultimately, like all great satire, it is really a no-holds-barred look at our current societal mores and norms.<br />The main characters in No Way are all composites, which is how Christopher Buckley is able to construct a storyline that departs from the actual events it is satirizing, but is still fully recognizable by anyone who followed the news in the late 1990s.  You'll enjoy picking out references to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand, Marc Rich, Alan Dershowitz, and of course Monica - plus many others.  Even Nick Naylor, the hero of Buckley's \\"Thank You for Smoking\\", has a bit part in No Way.<br />I've read most of Buckley's books, and No Way is right up there with his best.  I'd put \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" first by a hair, followed by No Way, then \\"God is My Broker\\".  Thank You is slightly more timeless, as No Way's humor will dissipate somewhat with time, as people's recollections of the Clinton years fade.<br />Christopher Buckley can legitimately lay claim to being America's top working satirist.  Keep them coming, Mr. Buckley, sir!	2004-02-13
US	39563054	R38WEQNVSW0E6O	0451191145	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	5	16	23	N	N	Why you should read this book	Atlas Shrugged is without a doubt one of the most important books of the 20th century, and is still entirely relevant today.  It addresses a subject (individualism vs. collectivism, in economics, philosophy and culture) that wars have been fought over, and which millions perished and suffered because of (the communist, socialist and fascist regimes of the 20th century).  Even today, while most of these collectivist states have collapsed, the debate over the proper role of the government and the degree to which wealth should be taken from some to be given to others continues unabated.  All of the arguments that politicians use today to justify their positions on tax policy, or regulation of businesses, or new health and welfare programs, or the evils of big businesses and powerful industrialists (e.g. the U.S. governments attempt to punish Microsoft and Bill Gates), appear in Rands masterpiece.  You could study these subjects by reading dry economics textbooks, but Rand has taken both sides of each argument, illustrated the conflict with dramatic images and events, and drawn the logical conclusions.<br />Atlas Shrugged is a 1000+ page refutation of Karl Marxs dangerously alluring statement:  from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.  Why doesnt this work, and why does it actually destroy societies?  Why would a cradle-to-grave welfare system (government guaranteed housing, medical care and food) fail?  Atlas Shrugged shows why, in incredible detail.  If only more people in the 20th century (and today) had been able to read and understand Ayn Rand, who knows how many lives could have been saved.<br />Atlas Shrugged is also an inspirational guide for how to conduct ones own life.  The top people Ive met in U.S. businesses more closely resemble Hank Reardon and Dagny Taggart than they do Jim Taggart and Wesley Mouch.  So, if you want some ideal role models on how to succeed in business, Atlas Shrugged provides them.  It is one of the few works of art to present engineers and applied scientists as true heroes.  Also, the book teaches the most important lesson about personal responsibility:  each individual, not others, is responsible for his/her own happiness.<br />Finally, there are other more trivial reasons to read Atlas Shrugged.  The plot is a page-turner; youll want to keep reading to find out what happens.  Youll feel a major sense of accomplishment when you finish.  You will find many interesting, amusing tidbits (I was surprised to learn that American academia was a collectivist, relativist hotbed in the 1950s  I had thought that was a phenomenon induced by the Sixties).<br />Its amazing to realize that Ayn Rand had this all figured out in 1957.  Its also heartening to see that Atlas Shrugged continues to be a top-seller (ranked in the top 1000 on Amazon right now) nearly 50 years after it was first published.  Why is this so?  Read the book!	2004-02-06
US	39563054	R2MY9CW06PF58E	0618341617	86549712	The Best American Essays 2003 (The Best American Series)	Books	5	23	24	N	Y	24 servings of rich, satisfying brain food	Last year's Best American Essays collection was edited by renowned (now, deceased) biologist Steven Jay Gould.  Anne Fadiman, the editor for this year's collection, is by profession an essay editor, and the positive results show in this collection.  Fadiman has chosen 24 essays whose common attribute is, as she states, that they are \\"crammed...the essays in this book... have no extra air.  They're all Haagen-Dazs,\\" for the brain, I might add.<br />My favorite was also Fadiman's, Andre Aciman's \\"Lavender\\", which just might revitalize the personal fragrance industry if it becomes read widely enough.  Other highlights, in my opinion, were Atul Gawande's \\"The Learning Curve,\\" a firsthand account of how medical professionals learn through trial and error (and the impact on society which this unavoidable fact causes), Francis Stufford's \\"The Habit,\\" about growing up as a bookworm, and \\"Home Alone,\\" in which Caitlin Flanagan skewers Christopher Byron's biography of Martha Stewart (she provides all the evidence needed to back up her arguments, so this is a successful, highly entertaining, vicious intellectual attack from one writer to another).  However, I found all the other essays save one to be almost equally as memorable and powerful.<br />Just one of the 24 essays is fatally, logically flawed, Elaine Scarry's \\"Citizenship in Emergency\\".  I'm surprised Fadiman chose it, since it clearly violates her prescription that \\"monumentality can be catastrophic\\" in an essay.  Scarry uses selective evidence from the events of 9/11 to expound upon her obviously deeply held belief that the defense of the U.S. should be returned in some manner to the citizenry (she doesn't say exactly how, other than to cite the founding fathers' reliance on citizen militias).  She launches into the typical left-wing tirade against the Bush administration and the war on terrorism, and even states that the fact that the U.S. possesses nuclear weapons means we are a monarchy, not a democracy.  This ignores the fact that we elect our Commander in Chief every four years, and that there was a vote of the people's representatives  (i.e. Congress) authorizing the Commander in Chief to invade Iraq.  To construct her initial argument in favor of citizenry-led self-defense, Scarry brushes aside the fact that the passengers on the flight that crashed into the Pentagon had almost as much time and opportunity to figure out a way to stop the hijackers as did the passengers of United flight 93, and ignores the strong likelihood that the military, which by the time United flight 93 crashed had figured out what was going on that day, would have brought down the flight if the passengers had not (this is not to take anything away from the passengers of United flight 93, who pulled off one of the most heroic acts in recent American history).  Furthermore, 9/11 represented not only a failure of the military to protect the Pentagon after the planes were hijacked, but equally prominently a failure of the U.S.'s non-military airline security system.  Would Scarry propose that we American citizens invoke our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms on flights to solve this problem as well?<br />The other overtly political essay, John Edgar Wideman's \\"Whose War\\", which argues that U.S. was wrong to overthrow the Taliban after 9/11 and instead should have negotiated with Osama bin Laden (to quote Wideman: \\"by speaking to one another we might formulate appropriate responses, even to the unthinkable\\"), is perfectly counterbalanced by Francine du Plessix Gray's \\"The Debacle\\", which shows firsthand what the French policy of appeasement towards (and military underestimation of) Hitler led to: a mass exodus and four years of Nazi occupation of France that was only reversed when the U.S.- and U.K.-led Allies landed at Normandy.<br />Aside from the issues cited with the two most political essays, this collection is smart, entertaining, thought provoking, well written, and diverse in its subject matter,exactly as one would hope from an essay anthology.	2003-12-23

My second daughter has now fallen in love with this book, at about the same age as her older sister did (3 and 1/2).  So, we are reading it every single night, often multiple times.  If her older sister is any guide, this will probably continue for about 6 months.<br />This is simply an absolutely perfect children's story.  The plot has some tension to keep the child's interest to the end of the story.  The story shows how small people (or trains, if you want to be literal) with a good heart (like a child) can make a big difference in the world.  The illustrations are extremely colorful and magical.  The only fault (this is incredibly minor) I can find is the one-time usage of the word \\"indignantly\\", which no child is going to know.  Other than that, I wouldn't change any other word or aspect of this book.<br />It's also a fun story for an adult to read outloud.  I enjoy using different voices for the arrogant Shiny New Engine, the gruff Freight Engine, and the tired Old Engine, as well as helpful Little Blue Engine's famous repetitive cadence (\\"I think I can\\").<br />It will be a sad day when my youngest outgrows this book.  Don't deny yourself or your child the pleasure - buy it!	2003-12-23
US	39563054	R2LQ0AJJEOFLXO	0618197338	504177010	The Best American Short Stories 2003	Books	5	18	18	N	Y	A vintage sampler	I don't think you can go wrong reading either the Best American or the O. Henry short story anthologies; I read both each year. It's somewhat surprising that they are not more popular, since they expose the reader to a wide variety of the best writers and writings, and since short stories can be easily fit into the busiest of lifestyles, especially plane and train rides. <br />Having now read both 2003 editions, I would give the edge to this year's Best American anthology.  The collection of stories that guest editor Walter Mosley has chosen are, in general, more readable, more entertaining, and cover a broader range of human emotions, subject matter, and genres.  I would also rate the 2003 Best American anthology as a better-than-average or even a vintage year.<br />I especially enjoyed the two \\"genre\\" stories included, a horror story and a science fiction story.  Each is memorable not because of the aspects of their plots that classify them in their genre, but for what they reveal about human nature.  Dan Chaon's \\"The Bees\\" shows the dangers of keeping secrets in an attempt to escape the past, and Ryan Harty's \\"Why the Sky Turns Red When the Sun Goes Down\\" contains a bizarrely fascinating plot element (a robotic child for couples unable to conceive their own), but what it actually illustrates is the difficult decisions parents make about their children, the immense power they have over them, and the changing relationships when a couple becomes a threesome by having a child.<br />Other highlights:  Susan Straight's \\"Mines\\", which is a stark, realistic portrayal of the tough choices facing people on both sides of the U.S. criminal justice system;  Mary Yukari Water's \\"Rationing\\", which illustrates the generational differences in Japanese society;  and Anthony Doerr's \\"The Shell Collector\\", which is the only story chosen for inclusion in both the Best American and O. Henry anthologies (and rightfully so).  Interestingly, there are actually two pairs of stories concerned with similar plot elements (robotic children, and father/son relationships after the mother has passed away), but each pair is very different.  This shows why this collection is so strong:  it's not so much due to the plot of each story, but rather to what each story says about the human condition.<br />Since choosing favorite stories is such a subjective process, each reader will no doubt have their own favorites.  However, this year's Best American anthology provides plenty of good stories from which to choose your own favorites.	2003-12-07
US	39563054	R2CI9QI9BPG52C	1400031311	239479552	The O. Henry Prize Stories 2003 (Pen / O. Henry Prize Stories)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Like an assortment of fine dark chocolates	I don't think you can go wrong reading either the O. Henry or the Best American short story anthologies; I read both each year.  It's somewhat surprising that they are not more popular, since they expose the reader to a wide variety of the best writers and writings, and since short stories can be easily fit into the busiest of lifestyles, especially plane and train rides.<br />Each anthology attempts to identify the best 20 short stories of the year, but together they prove just how subjective this quest ends up being.  This year, 2003, there is only one story that appears in both volumes, Anthony Doerr's \\"The Shell Collector\\".  Thus, the views and biases of the editors end up determining the final selection - and in fact, this is one of the selling points of the Best American series, which features a different guest editor (a well-known author) each year.  The O. Henry volume can rightfully claim to have a more consistent selection process, which produces more uniformity year to year.<br />2003 is the first year that Laura Furman (an author and professor at the UT at Austin - where does she find the time to read all these stories?) is editing the O. Henry series.  What are her biases?  She is kind enough to state them:  she favors stories whose emotional impact is \\"revealed ... by stress or loss, the twin capitals of the short story's dominion.  The peace of daily life, even the dullness of it, is what is decimated in the short story and replaced by the nightmares or sometimes the consolation of understanding another's existence or our own.\\"  With this as a prelude, don't expect any light-hearted love stories or comedies of manners.<br />Each of the twenty selections concerns itself with dark subject matter (death in many forms, alcoholism, doomed love affairs, to name a few), yet I did not find the overall effect to be depressing.  Rather, I think Furman has succeeded in her mission - these stories do teach the reader about humanity and what it means to be human.My favorite was the aforementioned \\"The Shell Collector,\\" which is a classically structured short story with easily deciphered symbolism and meaning.  Denis Johnson's \\"Train Dreams,\\" which two of the three prize jurists picked as their favorite (Furman did not want to cite any one story of the 20 as being the overall best), is a fantastic portrait of how the pioneer lifestyle has been affected by modern day inventions and society.  I felt these two stories stood above the rest, but I also enjoyed \\"The American Embassy\\" (which reminds us how America is viewed by people in many oppressed nations), \\"Lush\\", and \\"Bleed Blue in Indonesia\\".<br />Everyone who reads this collection will have his/her own favorites.  As the editors of the O. Henry and Best American short story series prove, it is impossible not to bring one's own biases to the subjective process of reading and experiencing a story.  Enjoy!	2003-11-25
US	39563054	R2SKTHECPE1MEN	0131417924	463605153	Network Systems Design Using Network Processors	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Prof. Comer demystifies NPs, for the technical masses	Prof. Douglas Comer of Purdue is one of the best textbook authors in the field of Internet technology (and those who have heard him speak, as I have, know that he is even better in person).  His TCP/IP volumes are classics that almost every engineer in the industry has read.  The fact that he chose to write a textbook on network processors is actually a strong validation of the importance of this technology, and will no doubt help popularize NPs.<br />The content of this book can be roughly divided into two halves:  an overview of NP technology, and then a case study of the Intel IXP1200, to put the theory into practice.  In the NP overview section, Comer does a great job of explaining how network systems have evolved over time, and why and where NPs are being used today.  He covers all the main technical issues involved in NP designs, such as memory hierarchies and software structure, and provides a survey of different NPs (which will become dated over time).  Comer wisely chose the Intel IXP 1200 as his case study, much to the chagrin of other vendors, I'm sure.  This was the best choice, since Intel is having more and more success with the IXP over time, especially as other NP vendors fall by the wayside (even Cisco, which built their own NP, is using the IXP family).<br />Prof. Comer's writing style is very straightforward and practical.  NPs are very complex devices, and Comer does a great job of leading the reader through the complexity, by starting at the highest level and working down into more detail, and by explaining the details in clear language that any reasonably skilled engineer (even at the undergraduate level) should be able to understand.  Comer views the world through the eyes of a software engineer, and while hardware purists might complain about the relative lack of hardware details, for a book on NPs this is absolutely the best approach, since the purpose of NPs is to make it possible to implement more functionality in software, thereby improving the flexibility and power of network systems.  My only negatives on the book are that I wish some more code examples had been included in earlier chapters, and the fact that Comer will need to produce a 2nd edition at some point soon, as the later generation IXPs become more widely used than the 1200.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, both students and professional engineers, who is looking for a solid introduction to NP technology, especially if they will be using the Intel IXP family.  At my current company, even our skilled NP engineers found value in this book, and we will be handing a copy to every new engineer who joins one of our NP project teams.	2003-11-21

I bought my first copy in the early nineties at the MIT Tech Coop bookstore, when a fellow geek friend of mine said I absolutely had to read it - he just shoved it into my shopping tote.  At that point in time I had never heard of Scott Adams, and I think the Boston Globe was one of a small handful of papers carrying Dilbert (it subsequently took two years of letter writing before my local paper agreed to carry it).<br />In BABLBSOS, Scott Adams covers his by now familiar territory of the world of American high tech business for the very first time.  BABLBSOS is not a rehash of the daily Dilbert strip like so many other collections of Adams'.  Rather, BABLBSOS is original material organized by topics, which collectively cover all major aspects of the workplace experience in a high tech company.  Since Adams is exploring this material for the first time, and is not doing it in a daily comic strip form, the results are more hard-hitting and concise than Adams' subsequent books.  Each page stands on its own and showcases in the best possible way Adams' brilliantly cynical understanding of how businesses all too often really function.<br />But BABLBSOS is more than just Scott Adams' best work.  It also is one of the best business books and management guides ever created, and certainly the pithiest.  All too many business books present prescriptions for how businesses should operate.  BABLBSOS is the opposite: an \\"anti-business\\" book that shows how businesses actually behave, from the perspective of the employees.  The challenge and guidance for managers, then, is to do the opposite of the pointy-haired boss, to avoid the situations that Adams presents.<br />After I originally read BABLBSOS, I recommended it to everyone I knew who would appreciate it (which is almost anyone who works for a living in a corporation), and used many of the panels in various presentations.  I still keep a copy handy in my office for reference.  So, as you can see, I cannot recommend BABLBSOS highly enough.	2003-11-11

Loomis, who undoubtedly was a brilliant left-brained rational thinker, was educated as a lawyer, rose through the ranks of a law firm, then quit to become one of the wealthiest bankers on Wall Street.  He foresaw the 1929 stock market crash and cashed out beforehand, and then gave up his finance career to educate himself so that he could work on the very leading edge of scientific research in multiple fields, including biology, physics, astronomy, and (at the very end of his life), computer science.  Because he possessed immense wealth, brains, and leadership qualities, as well as patriotism and a savvy understanding of geopolitics, he became a key individual who put together the multiple scientific labs and projects that helped the Allies win World War II.<br />Jennet Conant succeeds admirably in the primary objective of her book:  to describe the many technical and leadership contributions Loomis made to the scientific efforts, especially the development of radar systems, that ultimately produced victory for the Allies in World War II.  She makes a very strong case that without Loomis's leadership, the development of both radar and the atomic bomb would have been delayed, endangering the Allies' chances of success and resulting in many more lives lost.  Loomis's World War II efforts and achievements occupy half the book; the remainder covers the rest of his biography.<br />Besides being a fascinating, engrossing story, Tuxedo Park has much to teach the reader.  The common impression is that the development of the atomic bomb was the greatest scientific achievement in the Allies' victory; however, as one of the scientists says, \\"radar won the war, and the atomic bomb ended it\\".  Radar was the weapon the Allies used to defeat the Germans' submarines, superior air force,and rocketry.  Tuxedo Park also shows the interconnected web of relationships at the pinnacles of the worlds of science, academia, government, and business in the mid twentieth century.  Rational thought alone does not produce results; all accomplishments involve humans, and Loomis was able to navigate these worlds and relationships with remarkable aplomb.  The book also shows the negative side of Loomis and genius in general:  the toll it exacts on family life, and the depression and suicide that plagues certain families.<br />I have only minor quibbles with Tuxedo Park.  Loomis's pre-World War II achievements were so impressive and interesting that I would have enjoyed more detail about those years.  When Conant describes the many inventions of Loomis and others, I often had difficulty visualizing them; some line drawings would have helped.  And there are a few errors in the book, such as referring to the RAF when the author means the USAF.<br />I would recommend Tuxedo Park to anyone interested in biographies of scientific figures, as well as anyone who would appreciate a history lesson on the role science played in winning the last major world war.	2003-11-08

But ultimately, at its core, it is a story of escapism and the many ways in which people choose to or choose not to escape from aspects of their lives.<br />Chabon has many worthwhile thoughts to communicate to readers.  He covers topics such as mid 20th century social mores, life in New York City and the flight to the suburbs (a thinly fictionalized Levittown), the creation and impact of comic books, the artistic and creative process, the meaning of family, the scourge of Nazism and the affect of World War II on civilians, Jewish religious tradition, magic, government persecution, and the clash between labor and capital in the economic sphere.  Chabon's writing is well informed and intelligent, and he manages to cover these topics in a very entertaining style.<br />My issues with K&C are minor, the primary one being that I wish Chabon had run the novel through the distiller one more time, to reduce its volume by 25 percent and make it even more intense.  I found the portrayal of Clay's sexuality to be lacking, since it omitted any significant depictions of pleasure in his few furtive relationships (contrast this to the depictions of Kavalier's relationship with Rosa).  And the plotline is a bit fainter and harder to follow at times than it needs to be.<br />K&C is definitely a (but not \\"the\\") Great American Novel, and is recommended to anyone who enjoys a meaty tome with a plentitude of ideas to ponder.	2003-10-26

How many other historians could take a topic as vast as the American revolution, choose precisely those incidents and communications which best illuminate the key principles and principals, throw everything else out, and end up with an engaging series of seven stories that concludes in a mere 248 pages?<br />It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the history of the American revolution.  Ellis does not attempt to provide exhaustive coverage of every major event over the time period, and he correctly and thankfully avoids a blow-by-blow description of the battles of the war, since the fighting is not directly relevant to the meaning of the revolution.  The focus instead is on the character of the key individuals, their different thoughts on what the revolution was about, and how the leadership was able to find a way to start a new political system that has managed to survive for over 200 years.<br />Besides being an excellent historical overview of the revolution, there is much in Founding Brothers that is directly relevant to today's political discourse.  Our country is still debating the proper role of governmental authority and the people (witness the California recall election), idealism versus realism (witness the debate over the war in Iraq), and statesmanship versus partisan politics (just pick up the newspaper).  It is fascinating to read what our country's founders had to say about these issues and the strenuous debates that they had, most of which they couldn't resolve definitively either, and which were ultimately decided by razor thin votes (the 2000 presidential election).<br />Founding Brothers has inspired me to learn more about the thoughts and characters of the founders.  When I get to Adams and Jefferson, I may very well choose Ellis's books, since he researches his subjects thoroughly, writes very well, and looks at issues from multiple perspectives.  Founding Brothers is a great place to start a study of the topic, and hopefully the recognition the Pulitzer committee gave this book will ensure that it is read by as many people as possible.	2003-10-01

It was a great human drama, and unlike Dickens, it was all 100% nonfiction - it really did happen.  For anyone in the telecom industry who lived through the bubble, and now the depression, for anyone who invested in the telecom bubble, or for anyone curious about one of the greatest financial manias in human history, I recommend Broadbandits.<br />Broadbandits profiles most of the key individuals and companies who helped inflate (and in many cases profit from) the telecom bubble, at a steady one company per chapter pace.  Being in the telecom industry myself (still), I can state that Malik accurately captured the major stories I already knew, so I assume the rest of the book is generally factual.  Although Malik focuses most of his anger on company bigwigs, he also admits that a bubble the size of this one could not have been created without active, willing participation from all sectors of the community:  greedy disconnected CEOs, conflicted Wall Street and industry analysts, small investors who wanted to double their money overnight, and a unique confluence of regulatory and technological changes and advances.<br />Broadbandits could have been better.  Malik's principle sources are business press articles, and he has a fascination with documenting dollar figures, so he doesn't probe as deeply as he could into the reasons behind the actions he reports.  The book was written hurriedly (to keep it topical), and there are more than a few data errors.  Malik correctly cites Ravi Suria's seminal report on the debt and finances of telecom firms, which proved how the emperor of telecom stocks had no clothes (I remember almost crying for joy when I originally read Suria's report), but he missed Jeremy Siegel's equally important bubble bursting op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal proving that Cisco and other high P/E stocks were way overvalued and that we were experiencing another \\"Nifty Fifty\\" tech mania episode.  Finally, to return to my Dickens reference, the book would be even more dramatic if it recounted more anecdotal stories and statistics of the small investors and employees who lost their money, retirement savings and jobs, to provide contrast to the well-documented stories of folks who cleared many millions during the boom.  However, I do admit that with the title of Broadbandits, the focus is on the bigwigs who inflated and profited from the bubble.<br />One more minor quibble:  two of the people who praise Broadbandits on the back cover are thanked by Malik in his Acknowledgements.  Conflicts of interest are everywhere!  And just what did Malik do during his brief stint as a venture capitalist?	2003-09-19

To determine whether the market is over- or under-priced, they rely upon valuation methods that will please the heart of a classically trained economist or business school student:  price, P/E ratio, dividend rate, and price-to-book, comparing today's figures to the 15-year moving average.  Examining the performance of the S&amp;P 500 over the past century, they convincingly prove that a strategy of doubling up investments in \\"buy\\" (under-valued) years and avoiding investing in over-valued years delivers superior performance to a buy-and-hold (or dollar cost averaging) strategy.<br />Although what Stein and DeMuth have proven seems like common sense from one angle (buy heavily when prices are low), it is not what most of Wall Street and the financial press urges investors to do.  Nor is it emotionally easy to follow this advice, since it means buying at times such as the middle of the Great Depression, when the popularity of stock market investing is at its lowest ebb, and it means avoiding buying when the market is zooming to the moon, and it seems as though every neighbor of yours is making a fortune in Internet and telecom stocks (the late Nineties).  Stein and DeMuth do a great job describing these situations, to provide the internal fortitude needed to follow a buy low strategy.<br />The debate over this book arises over how applicable it is to the average individual investor (its target audience).  All the research conducted by Stein and DeMuth concerns the S&amp;P 500, and they freely admit that the conclusions they draw do not necessarily apply to other indices, markets, or individual stocks.  Furthermore, they look at 20-year results, so the final verdicts for the last 20 years (including the bull market of the `90s) are not in yet.<br />However, Stein and DeMuth cite many others studies that are aligned with their general strategy of buying under-valued stocks, and summarize the superior results that these other studies report.  Because of this, and the book's sharp wit and hard-hitting style, this book is a great introduction to value investing and the fundamental methods of valuing stocks.  The boom and bust of the late Nineties and early 2000s prove that far too many investors (and professionals) don't pay enough attention to stock market valuation.<br />This book won't tell you how to make a quick fortune.  It won't tell you how to identify the next Microsoft or Dell Computer.  But it does tell you how to identify better times to invest in stocks, and can help you avoid huge losses from investing in bubbles.  Because of the strength of the book's advice, which recent history proves is so often ignored, and the fact that it is a short and entertaining read, I highly recommend it.	2003-09-08

This book is not an assemblage of the best short stories from the entire body of 20th century American literature; rather, this book is an anthology of the best stories that happened to have appeared in the annual Best American Short Story volumes.  So, to make it into this book, a story would have had to be recognized when it was written as being one of the best of that year, as chosen by a single editor/reader.<br />I enjoy reading short stories, and every year I purchase both the O. Henry Prize Stories and the Best American Short Stories.  When I first did this, I was amazed at how little overlap there is between 20 stories chosen for each anthology (usually, there are only one or two stories in common, and typically the story chosen by O. Henry as the best of the year does not appear in the other anthology).  So once again we have evidence that beauty (and art and subjective opinions such as \\"best\\") are in the eye of the beholder.<br />So, can John Updike's selections be debated?  Undoubtedly;  every reader of this anthology will be able to cite stories and authors that they believe should have been included (as for me, I was most disappointed by the absence of Ray Bradbury).  But is this anthology worth reading?  Absolutely!<br />Reading this anthology cover-to-cover is like traveling through time, and provides an enriching perspective on the history of the 20th century in America.  From the hardscrabble existence of immigrants and farmers, to the Depression, to the problems of racism, to the war, to the ennui that exists in a time of relative plenty, these stories do cover the broad American experience of the past century.  Furthermore (aside from Ray Bradbury), many of our best authors are represented, so this book is a good way to get introduced to authors that one has heard about but not read before.<br />It's surprising to me that short story anthologies aren't more popular, given our busy society.  A well written short story entertains, conveys a message, teaches something about the human condition, and can be enjoyed in one sitting, such as a short plane or train ride.  I would highly recommend this anthology as a way for short story novices to get started, and then one can graduate to the annual O. Henry and Best American Short Story anthologies.iven our busy society.

Henry Prize Story anthology.  I originally gave this book to my wife as a gift, acting under the usually reliable rule of buying others gifts that you would enjoy.  However, now that I've read the book myself, I understand why she just rolled her eyes when I asked her for her impression of the book.  I strongly suspect that red-blooded American males will get much more enjoyment out of this book than their modern-day liberated female counterparts.<br />\\"Kissing in Manhattan\\" qualifies as male fantasy every bit as much as Playboy Magazine, and hence is quality entertainment for men.  The male lead characters fit in one of two categories:  super strong ego, dominating / controlling types (Checkers in the first story, and Patrick Rigg), or the polar opposite:  supremely introverted, shy, meek, passive Clark Kent types (Jeremy Jax, Douglas Kerchek, James Branch).  The women are almost all drop-dead gorgeous, smart, and game for almost anything.  I am quite certain that I will live my entire life without ever having a beautiful 26 year-old woman do to me what the female lead in the story \\"Serendipity\\" does to a much older, facially disfigured man.  So, even though that story and others lack a degree of realism, that doesn't mean they can't be enjoyed - as fantasy.<br />The other cultural reference that I thought of when reading this book, especially the title story \\"Kissing in Manhattan,\\" is the Adrian Lyne / Mickey Rourke / Kim Basinger movie \\"Nine ½ Weeks.\\"  The profiles of the male lead characters in the movie and this book are almost identical:  extremely successful, relatively young Wall Street men (it is never explained precisely how they make their money) who use their power and money to control beautiful women.  Schickler's book, of course, delves deeper than Lynne's movie, but I suspect that if you were intrigued by the movie, you would be similarly intrigued by this book.<br />Schickler creates well-crafted stories.  Several of them go right to the very last word before you know what really has happened and how to interpret it.  However, when I ask myself what new insights I have gained into the human condition by reading this book, I am a bit at a loss.  Certainly a reader will learn that Manhattan is populated almost entirely with flawed, eccentric personalities.  However, even with all the possibilities for different human interaction that exist on the island of Manhattan, loneliness pervades.  Beyond that, it is difficult to draw too many other conclusions, since the characters are a bit fantastical.	2003-07-13
US	39563054	RHH3UADCAK93P	0679734163	392770289	To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Instructive for those interested in the engineering process	I read this book right after having read Samuel Florman's \\"The Existential Pleasures of Engineering,\\" and it suffers somewhat in comparison.  Both writers give themselves the same basic thesis:  as Petroski states in the Preface, \\"this book is my answer to the questions `What is engineering?' and `What do engineers do?'\\"<br />While Florman's brilliant work truly does explain the role of engineering among man's intellectual pursuits, as well the passion that drives engineers (the \\"what\\" and \\"why\\" of the profession), Petroski has produced a work much more focused on the \\"how\\" or process of engineering, in particular structural / civil engineering.  In this book, Petroski answers best a somewhat more mundane question posed to him by a neighbor: how could the skywalks in the Kansas City Hyatt Regency collapse in 1981?<br />Petroski does a decent job explaining why engineering, like any other profession performed by human beings in a universe with non-zero entropy and finite time and money, cannot achieve perfection.  He fills his book with many examples of infamous structural engineering failures, from the pyramids of Egypt to present day.  Almost all of these are enthralling to anyone with a modicum of interest in the subject matter;  the one exception is Petroski's postulate as to the failures of his aged kitchen knives.  After having read Petroski's book, the reader will understand why there will continue to be engineering failures far into the future (this is not to say that the rate of failures cannot be decreased).<br />Besides not achieving as broad a thesis as he may have intended, the other main problem with Petroski's book is its repetitiveness of his major lessons, namely that engineers can learn more from failures than successes, and are duty-bound to analyze failures for learning opportunities.  While valuable, these lessons are repeated in almost every chapter, such that any one chapter could stand alone as an individual essay on the topic.  A final issuefor readers to consider is how much of Petroski's book is relevant to other branches of engineering besides structural / civil.  Certainly not every engineer is designing objects whose failure could endanger human life, and many in the software profession would say that most of their lessons on how to design software come from studying algorithms and the designs of successful programs.  However, by erring on the side of caution, one can claim Petroski's book applies to all engineering as well as other professions, particularly medicine.<br />I would recommend Petroski's book foremost to structural / civil engineers, and next to all engineers and others interested in the engineering design process.	2003-07-06
US	39563054	R44XPVOV0YQ7B	0312141041	639675278	The Existential Pleasures of Engineering (Thomas Dunne Book)	Books	5	16	18	N	N	A thorough, rational, cohesive philosophy of Engineering	Samuel Florman gives himself a significant task:  to explain who engineers are, what motivates them, how they derive pleasure in their work, and, most importantly, how their work is connected to the overall progress of civilization and the human race.  He succeeds brilliantly, in a work that has deservedly become a classic.<br />Florman covers a great deal of ground in his book, with a focus on the last 150 years of the engineering profession.  He quotes extensively from other works of literature and culture (from Homer to Paul McCartney), and has obviously read widely and thought deeply about his subject matter.  He spends a good portion of his book refuting the views of people he calls antitechnologists, whose views were popular among the Sixties counterculture crowd.  But ultimately, what Florman accomplishes is to provide a constructive, pragmatic philosophy of the Engineering profession, that allows society to move forward to solve the never-ending set of problems that we face.<br />As a good work of philosophy (or science) should, Florman's book (originally published more than 30 years ago) provides an intellectual framework for interpreting events of today.  Although the views of the \\"strong\\" antitechnologists have failed to incite a large-scale revolution of Americans returning to the agrarian villages of yesteryear or the communes of the Sixties, the battle between technophiles and technophobes continues unabated.  Florman's book provides insights into the debates over issues such as energy policy, environmentalism, genetically modified foods and drugs, land use policy, globalization, as well as the future direction of the U.S. economy, especially after the technology/Internet boom and bust of the late `90s and early `00s.<br />Ultimately, Florman would argue that these are not issues of technology; engineers can be directed to build fail-safe nuclear power plants or super-efficient solar energy collectors or both or none.  These are decisions to be made byan informed citizenry, their political representatives, and regulated profit-seeking corporations - ultimately, a society that understands technology and risk, and that does not exhibit Luddite antitechnology biases.  Meanwhile, I am sure he would be dismayed to see U.S. college engineering enrollments declining, especially among native-born Americans - there are plenty of people in the rest of the world who still value the Engineering profession.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone thinking about entering or already in the Engineering profession, to anyone interested in learning more about the profession, and to teachers and those in positions of influence over young people's choice of careers.  Ideally it would also be read by politicians and antitechnologists; it would be very interesting to hear how someone would directly refute Florman's arguments.	2003-06-27

Thanks to the success of his previous book, \\"Built to Last\\", Collins was able to assemble a large team of B-school students to do the grunt work, while he could concentrate on organizing the findings and summarizing them in this book.<br />Collins presents his findings in the chronological order of the steps he feels must be taken to transition from good to great.  All in all, his findings will make sense to any student of Peter Drucker's, and they mostly ring true with my own 20 years of experience in the world of business.  Collins advocates a very straightforward, fad-avoiding, \\"stick to your knitting\\" approach to business, with an emphasis on rational thinking, consistent action, and substance over style.  So, the book presents a very strong case that these basic principles can, applied consistently over long periods of time, lead to major success (the good guys win in the end).<br />That said, I do feel that Collins overreaches a bit.  He preaches with the zeal of a true believer, at one point stating \\"Furthermore, if you ever stop doing any one of the key ideas, your organization will inevitably slide backward toward mediocrity.\\"  However, he occasionally bends the facts to fit his theories.  After heaping immense praise on Nucor's CEO Ken Iverson (Collins obviously shares Iverson's strict egalitarian philosophy of compensation), Collins explains Nucor's recent troubles by finding one person to claim that Iverson had actually degenerated as a leader.  Collins also rails against companies that stray outside their core businesses, but then concocts a questionable core business for the very successful yet highly diversified GE, claiming that its core business is theproduction of great General Managers to run businesses from aircraft engines to TV broadcasting.  But given the challenge of simplifying a very complex world, Collins can be forgiven these minor sins.<br />The book is an easy read for the busy executive, roughly 200 pages of narrative text divided into bite-sized 20 page chapters.  Collins communicates clearly and crisply, and sprinkles in illustrative anecdotes that occasionally tug on emotional heartstrings.  Some of his terminology (e.g. \\"Level 5 Leadership\\") will no doubt enter the American business lexicon just as BHAG (from \\"Built to Last\\") has, although I wish he had chosen a more serious term than \\"Hedgehog Concept\\".	2003-06-11

Roth proves his stature as one of America's greatest living writers by, in the mere span of roughly 150 large-type pages, offering insights into subjects such as man's intellectual nature versus man's sexual nature, Puritanism, academia and political correctness, the Sixties, marriage and family, mortality, and the randomness of fate.  One could go on and on describing the many attributes of this book, but in the spirit of Roth's pithiness, I will just say: \\"read it!\\"	2003-06-11
