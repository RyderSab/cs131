Forced into singlehood she starts to reevaluate the people and things in her life that are important to her and this leads her on the path to self-discovery. She discovers what she'd lost most during her ill-fated relationship; herself. This book is a fun, light read and anyone who's ever been through a break up or had self doubts can relate to this novel.	2005-06-18

This practice hasn't failed me yet. The Other Woman is another fantastic book. Written with enthusiasm and wit; this book looks at the life of a woman named Ellie Cooper. She finds the man of her dreams, gets married and then realizes she is also married to the other woman- her mother-in-law. I won't say this book is unpredictable but it will have you reading well into the night to finish it. The characters in the Other Woman are almost three dimensional and you will root for Ellie as she tries to sort out married life, in-laws, babies, etc.	2005-05-23

After hearing several of my friends raveing about this book; I decided to finally read it. Although Good in Bed starts out strong the main character Cannie and the plot slowly take a nosedive. It's almost as if the author just wanted to finish the book quickly. Although the protagonist, Cannie, becomes self aware and develops throughout the novel, Good in Bed is very far fetched. There are so many overly fictionalized people surrounding her and helping her along the path to her self discovery that you just shake your head as you read. Yes I know this is a novel but it's not supposed to be total fantasy. The ending of Good in Bed was especially disappointing in a predictable chick lit happy ending way. I'm not sure why this book was recommended so highly to me but I won't be passing it along.	2005-05-02

This book is banking on the fame of the bestseller 'He's Just Not That Into You' which was a smashing success. The first book was original and funny, this novel is so-so. The only reason this novel has flown off the shelves is because its title misleads the reader. One of my friends sent me this book and although it does dole out some useful advice and fun dating lingo (i.e. the 'dating treadmill' and 'meantime guys')I'd say stick to the original 'He's just not that into you' and skip this doppelganger.	2005-04-01

This book is based around a woman named Alice. Alice was a nice woman who married a man she adored and became the woman he wanted her to be- a beautiful, well-kept WASP. Needless to say if you have to change yourself for the man you love problems will ensue. Alice's husband Joe is a handsome, charismatic man. Once Alice has become the perfect wife, he becomes bored and begins having affairs. This novel is great because you can actually watch Alice as she begins to have a mind of her own and stops putting on a brave face knowing her husband is cavorting with women all over town. I found myself moved by her growth in the book. The only aspect of this book that wasn't great was the predictable ending and the way Jane Green wrapped up all the loose story lines in the last two pages. Other than that it's fab and will hold your attention to the last page.	2005-03-22

I could not muster any sympathy for the protagonist because she made poor choices for herself time and time again throughout the book. BYPASS this chick lit read and buy something like the book 'You Have to Kiss a lot of Frogs' or 'Slightly Single'. Those novels will quench your thirst for a good read. 'Last Year of Being Single' will not.	2005-02-13

To any woman who's kissed (and may still be kissing) her share of frogs- you'll adore this book. The protagonist is a 45yr old single jewish actress. The novel is written as an account of her 20+ years of dating. Karrie Kline (the main character) looks back over all the blind dates, relationships and strange occurrences of the male kind she has had with humor and wit. The book is a great find and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys 'chick-lit' or can appreciate another woman's man trials and tribulations.	2005-01-10

ANY woman who has ever been single will relate to Suzanne's dilemnas- family members wondering why she's not married as she's over 30, attending weddings solo when everyone else seems to have a signficant other, etc. She literally travels all over the globe looking for the man who she will deem worthy of breaking her sex-less streak. She volunteers, uses match.com, moves to a new city and travels constantly in her pursuit. Perhaps the most refreshing thing about this book is that Suzanne is smart and confident and knows all along that a man will not make her 'complete' She's just like any other single gal out there. Holding out for someone special. You will root for her, sympathize with her and laugh at her misadventures all the way to the last page. Don't miss The Curse of the Singles Table- it's fantastic fun.	2004-12-12

I've read all of the author's Shopaholic books and was very pleased to note that Can You Keep a Secret? is just as good as the Shopaholic series. This novel is centered around a normal, 20something woman named Emma who works as a marketing assistant. Everything is normal that is, until she meets a stranger on a plane. In a moment of weakness during turbulence Emma dispenses all of her innermost thoughts and secrets to the man beside her on the plane. She figures it will be ok to divulge this information as she will probably never see him again.... Until he turns out to be the head of her company in town to visit the office!!! This book is great. You'll love finding out what happens when Emma's secrets become common knowledge to her friends, family and coworkers. Some things are better left unsaid... or are they????	2004-12-07

Fast food nation is a brilliant example of muckraking. The author obviously spent years researching the fast food, meatpacking and potato industries. Not only did he hit the books, he also interviewed employees of slaughterhouses/meatpacking facilities, fast food chains, ranchers and potato industry insiders. What develops from his research is a book that EVERYONE should read. It will open your eyes to the conditions of the employees in meatpacking plants, the lack of hygiene with which meat is handled, and the types of illnesses one can contract from the millions of pounds of ecoli and salmonella infected meat served up to consumers daily.... Mr. Schlosser also gives solutions to the current problems and suggests that if larger leading meat purchasers such as McDonald's called for higher standards in meat preparation some of the problems we're having would be solved.... I have learned enough from Fast Food nation to know that I don't plan on eating red meat in the U.S. again anytime soon! Now that I know what goes on every step of the way before the 'meat' gets to my mouth, I'm done. Here's hoping Mr. Schlosser doesn't write an indepth tale about the poultry industry or I may have to go vegan ;)	2004-12-02

This book is like a quilt- it weaves the fabric of four women's lives together as they reunite on a steamboat to toss the ashes of one of their best friends into the Mississippi River. The women met originally when they were just young girls at a women's college. While in school they made a raft and sailed down the Mississippi River together. The novel picks up when the women are reunited thirty years later on the same river. Each character has had a fulfilling, complicated life that unfolds in each chapter. Their lives are far from the 'innocence' of their youth. But the one thing that remains constant is their strong bond as women and friends. Maybe I'm biased to love this book because I went to a women's college in Virginia an hour away from the author's college and can vividly remember places, universities and situations that she writes about. But I think any woman would relate to this book- the struggles we all go through in the courses of our lives leading into the unknown and the people along for the ride with us. I'm eager to read more of Ms. Smith's novels and have recommended Last Girls to all of my friends, my sisters really, from Mary Baldwin College.	2004-11-29

She's an author who really explores her characters and makes them famailiar and three-dimensional to the reader. However, although Monkey Business is well-written; it's a far cry from her other books. The novel is written from the perspective of four different narratives. Each narrative is spoken in the voice of one of the four main characters who have one thing in common-they are all in Business School together. They are all very different from one another but become friends since they are in the same work groups and classes in school together. The book was a little too soap-operay and  predictable for me. If you're looking for a great read; try one of Ms. Mlynowski's other books such as Fish Bowl, As Seen on TV or the classic Milk Run. They are exceptional chick lit fiction :)	2004-11-26

Although the fourth installment of the series is good; the extreme shopping tendencies of Rebecca Brandon and the overly dramatized ANTI-shopping tendencies of her sister are just too much. I found myself saying 'Oh c'mon, give me a break' many times. The author, Sophie Kinsella, should have left the books as a trilogy and moved on.	2004-11-16

I must admit that at first I was not particularly thrilled at the prospect of reading Stupid White Men when a friend leant the book to me. I was used to seeing Mr. Moore behaving as an 'angry white man' ranting about the injustices of big business & politicians is his films. Therefore, I found myself unprepared and pleasantly suprised by the intelligence and wit with which he wrote this book. This is a great read that exposes a lot of political agendas and comments on everything from the 2000 'election' to the state of our nation. This book shows another side of Michael Moore, beyond the irate man on tv & film you will get to know the intelligent witty man he really is & learn a lot along the way. I'm now planning on reading his next novel 'Dude, Where's My Country?' as well.	2003-12-30

Thirty Nothing was extremely readable and I found myself reading until 3am so that I could finish the book in 2 days, at which point I was sad the book ended.

Let me start by saying that I am a proud Southern Woman! That's why this book interested me in the first place. I was pretty disappointed after reading What Southern Women Know; simply because I didn't realize it was a type of self-help for non-southerners. The novel divulges a lot of information that can be said about women all over the globe, not just the south. Mostly it's just a boring rehash of the author's own experiences and ideas of what makes a southern woman unique.	2003-12-26

I can't decide which book by Sarah Mlynowski is my favorite because all of them are brilliantly written and tremendously funny. As Seen on TV is no exception. It's witty and clever in its jabs at the current phenomenon of reality tv and instant celebrity. This novel is centered around a woman named Sunny who moves to New York and takes a job on the reality series Party Girls! because she's unemployed &amp; thought it would be a good fill-in job with nice perks. At first the gig is just something to pass the time, but once the series takes off &amp; fame sets in suddenly Sunny believes her new career path is set and she wants to be a full-time celeb.

Her mastery of writing didn't really shine through in this book. Straight Talking is chick lit in its purest, most stripped down sense. There are no grand illustrations painting out the scenes in your brain. It's more just basic girl wants bad boy but through much soul-searching and heartbreak realizes the good boy was the catch all along. Although this little read was excellent for a debut novel, I suggest skipping ahead &amp; reading other selections by Ms. Green such as; Jemima J or Mr. Maybe over this novel any day. The characters are more three-dimensional &amp; the plots are less formulaic.	2003-11-27

Since most people's families are dysfunctional in one way or another, many times the book will touch on subjects, emotions, or situations that hit close to home. The author's brilliant insights into anorexia and mental instability seem unforced, perhaps drawing from autobiographical life experiences. That's what makes Hunger Point such a good read. You can actually perceive what all of the characters are going through at all times and feel for them. I read this book in one day because it was so gripping.	2003-11-17

I'm suprised to be one of the first reviewers who didn't particularly like Ms. Green's latest book! After loving Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Babyville. Although the book is well written with likeable characters; I just couldn't get into it or relate. Maybe it's because I'm nowhere near considering having a baby. Of course that's the main focus of this novel. Babyville is three women's stories and their very drastic conceptions (or attempt at conception) and the drama that goes along with having a child. The first woman is Julia, a high end tv producer who's trying to save her relationship with her boyfriend and fill a void by having a baby. The next is Maeve who has the same job as Julia and would rather die than have a child at this stage in her career. And the third is Sam, Julia's best friend, who's pregnant with her first child. I have to say the book would be great for anyone who's planning on having a baby, is pregnant, or just had a child. But if you're not at that stage in life, it's a little hard to relate to.....	2003-06-06

The book is good, but its lessons aren't anything I haven't read or heard before. What is inspiring are the author's other 3 books. A Child Called It, The Lost Boy and a Man Named Dave. This trilogy of novels is gut-wrenching and inspiring at the same time. I admire Mr. Pelzer's will to achieve and to help others &amp; those books and his personal appearances are where his strengths lie. Not in the self-help, Help Yourself.	2003-05-26

The answer: not that great. Although this little novella does demonstrate Mr. Martin's grip on human nature, his narratives are long and boring. In fact the first 50 pages or so are all narrative. It takes almost half the book for the author to introduce his characters to the reader. That was a bit much for me. I applaud the author for his attempt to branch out &amp; admittedly I've read worse by other so-called best-selling authors who write for a living. But I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who's an avid reader.	2003-05-21

I've read all of Wendy Holden's books &amp; Gossip Hound reminded me why they're so superb. This latest novel is a fantastic display of writing on the author's part. Her characters are well written, but more importantly the main heroine, Grace, gets herself into so many wacky situations that you won't want to put this book down! Gossip Hound is the story of two women and their intertwining lives. The heroine, Grace is a PR agent at a small bookshop. The villain, Belinda Black, is a writer of a small columnn for the Globe. These two ladies who on the surface couldn't be more different~ Grace is shy, with low self-esteem on the man-front; while Belinda is a self-centered vixen~ or so she thinks, are connected by their clients and lovers. You'll laugh heartily at all the sticky situations both women go through to get recognition and fabulous assignments. But don't read too fast, you'll be sad when it's over.	2003-05-19

Each chapter details a unique characteristic of 'bombshellism'. From what a bombshell wears, reads, or listens to; to what she loves (animals), her tantrums, and even how her astrological sign affects her. What this book lacks in length, it makes up for with great sketches and name-dropping. Although most of the scenarios listed are taken from early movies with impossibly gorgeous screen sirens like Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, some things still hold true and frankly, most women have a lil' bombshell in them.	2003-04-26

She's finally marrying the man she adores, but has accidentally allowed two weddings in two different countries to be planned for the SAME DAY!

There are some similarities with the two novels such as the author's excellent portrayal of her characters, semi-graphic sex scenarios, and predictable ending.

Like most of the chick lit of our time, you'll pull for the heroine, Jane, as she floats through one bad date after another and also attempts to get a promotion at work. The fact that Jane's high school nemesis is her stepping stone to the promotion makes it all the more fun. I highly recommend this book and have already leant it to my best friend.	2003-04-25

I found it very hard to sympathize with the main character, Katie Castle, because she's so self-centered and materialistic. Although the reader is taken on a voyage where girl (Katie) has everything, makes a stupid mistake, loses everything including boy, and then starts the path to recovering everything, I just didn't find myself careing what happened to her. Reading the book from Katie's perspective was aggravating since I didn't agree with most of her thought processes and disliked her. For readers looking for a good book with fashion and wacky 20something girl antics, I would suggest reading something lighter with a stronger, more likeable heroine. For instance any of Sophie Kinsella's 'Shopaholic' novels.	2003-04-25

If you skip the first 50 pages or so of this book, it's FABULOUS. The first few chapters are tidbits you could read in any glossy magazine about makeup, fashion, etc. But then the author, Anna Johnson, becomes inspired and adds in handy advice for 20somethings. Advice about what types of tools every girl should own, to dating technique dos &amp; don'ts, to career &amp; money advice. The section about credit card debt was helpful &amp; greatly appreciated.

This book was so excellent, that after I finished it & decluttered my apartment, I sold it (& other books I've read) on an amazon auction to declutter some more space on my bookshelf. This novel delves into decluttering your home, body, mind, and spirit. It explains how only by decluttering all of these areas will you feel the complete weights of clutter being lifted from your being. Your inner and outer self both need decluttering. I found it hard to continue reading each chapter because I kept wanting to get up and clean out drawers, closets, and cupboards so badly. Once you start to throw things away and you can see surfaces and floor spaces that were covered for months or years, it's extremely liberating and uplifting. I cleared out an area that contained boxes in front of my bedroom window (they were there from the day I moved in almost 2 years ago!!!) and was so pleased at being able to fully see the window, that I went out and got a curtain rod and a light, flowing, see through drape. Every time I see the empty space and drape I'm happy at the small feat I accomplished. Pick this book up, it has excellent tips and is easy to read. It will motivate and inspire you, filling you with useful knowledge along the way!	2002-02-26

It stars the penniless but charming  Rebecca Bloomwood. She's a financial advice guru who is in debt up to her eyeballs but can't pass a store without going in and buying something. I have to say this book had me laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes and was glad that Rebecca was still struggling with her incessant need to shop after the fairy-tale happy ending of the first novel.

Like some of the other reviewers of Slightly Single have stated, I really related to this book's main character and the emotional baggage she carries around from a hideous boyfriend. Every woman, at some point in their lives, has had one. The man they thought the sun and moon rose & set over, who didn't care what happened to her as long as she still adored him. Other than just relating to the novel though, it's just a darn good read! I was amused at the shenanigans the main character Tracey kept getting herself into, and also I love that the novel doesn't end with a sappy fairytale ending where everyone is happy and blissful and fake (don't worry, I'm not giving anything away here!!) So if you're a 20 or 30 something woman looking for an entertaining novel to pass the time on a bus, train, vacation, or whatever, you'll like this book. It's a quick read that's funny.

Although this novel was brilliantly written, I found the subject matter to be boring and slightly unsettling. There are many incidents in the novel which lead me to ask the question, how much does the author, Ms. Hamilton, or any woman really, know about how a teenage male thinks &amp; acts? How he deals with relationships with family, friends, and love interests. It seems far fetched througout the book. Also, the story that unfolds (from the main character, Henry's, viewpoint) is disturbing. His obsessive interest in his mother's love affair &amp; the belief that he was his mother's husband in a former life left a bad taste in my mouth. This isn't the type of book I normally read &amp; the only reason I finished it was due to the fact that I was interested in what would happen to Henry's sister Elvira. I wouldn't recommend this novel to my family or friends or anyone else.	2002-01-04

I loved Anna Maxted's first novel and couldn't wait to read Running in Heels. Unfortunately, my expectations were very high. Although both novels were brilliantly written, the subject matter of Running in Heels is most distressing. A quarter of the the way through the book it's revealed that the main character is losing control and has become anorexic. From that point on there was much discussion of her disease by her friends and family &amp; how she was chosing to deal with it (denial). I thought I was getting a light novel about a 20something trying to make it in the world, but I got a novel about an anorexic coping &amp; there was no forewarning. It was sad not comical and I wish I hadn't started the book. I did finish it, only to find out if she would get well or not, but I wanted to warn others who might think this book is about an ordinary girl.	2002-01-03

Ok so my review title is a little harsh; but honestly, I've read a lot of '20 somethings trying to make it in the real world' type of books lately and this is one of the worst ones I've read.<br />I didn't feel any sympathy for the main character, Claudia, and sort of wished she just pick herself up and get over it! She whined about growing up with her unloving german mother in a crappy town in arizona constantly, hated her job, and had boyfriends that were the wrong type of men (married men). All of her problems seemed frivolous and mundane, they were depressing @ times. With a little bit of adjustment in the writing the novel could have been better. But unlike Jemima J, Bridget Jones, Getting Over It, and other numerous books where the 'heroine' of the book had strange &amp; quirky problems, in those books you pulled for her and wanted her to make it through her 20's and be ok. With Claudia, I just didn't care and wanted to finish the book once and for all. The summary on the back of the book is very misleading, don't think this is an uproariously funny, light read. It's light, but not so funny. If you're looking for a fun book where you connect with the main character, skip this one.	2001-12-17

I read this book in 3 days and put off friends and several hours of sleep to get through it. The main character, Claire is so three dimensional I was able to relate to many of her sentiments, struggles, and triumphs. Her thoughts were depicted to perfection, to the point where I wondered if the author, Marian Keyes, had been through similar instances in her life and written a diary to go back to her thoughts later on while writing Watermelon. I loved Claire's 'analyze everything to death' character and all of the messes she got into (&amp; out of). This is really a novel about relationships, heartbreak, &amp; survival.

If you have read the author's previous book, simply divine, be in store for the same witty banter and adventurous mishaps, with the plot following several characters besides the main character. Unfortunately the problem I had with Bad Heir Day WAS the main character. She was well developed on paper, but rather dumb and unlikeable. I couldn't find myself enjoying the parts of the book dedicated to her because she was such a hopeless case. The funniest parts in this book lie not with the main character, Anna, but with the family she nannies for. Cassandra, her husband Jett, and their hellacious son were the real stars of this novel. Also the tie-ins of Champagne D'vyne's character from the first book were very amusing as well and an unexpected treat. So if you want to read something light &amp; fun Bad Heir Day is a good choice but I really recommend Ms. Holden's other book, Simply Divine over this one.	2001-06-13

If you are comfortable with yourself and the relationships in your life, you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for a light, witty read and are not reading 'Sex and the City' as an example of what dating in New York encompasses, you will like this book. Accept the novel as a series of short stories and anecdotes written to amuse you, and you will enjoy it. I did!	2001-02-27

The books I usually read are about younger women who're going through many of the same daily trials as I am. But this book is a great quick read!! You won't want to put it down! I really wanted to know how things would turn out for the main character, Sam. There are some great passages in the novel that made me giggle. For example when Sam spends $12,000 @ Tiffany's to get back at her ex-husband. Or when she starts taking in boarders to help pay for her mortgage. This is a nice read and most women will relate to Sam's anxieties, whims, and ultimately female empowerment towards the end. I enjoyed this novel and have passed it on to my mom so that she may enjoy it as well. Thanks Oprah!	2001-02-22

Much Like Jemima J or Bridget Jones, Simply Divine is a tale of a 20 something British Magazine 'reporter'. It's decisively witty with many one-liners and puns.  I enjoyed it thoroughly. The characters were well developed and likeable. The story easy to follow. The only downfall for some American readers will be the sporadic use of some unrecognizeable British words. Other than that, ENJOY!	2001-02-20

Set your mind up to believe that and you'll adore this gem of a book as well. Fielding writes with great detail, passion, and humor. The book is divided into two settings, England and Africa. The main character Rosie Richardson is the link between the two. She starts out as an employee for a 'glossy' magazine. She meets many celebrities and has a celeb boyfriend, however finding her life overly stressful and slightly unmeaningful, she decides to leave her life in England behind and go to work in Africa. When a famine and locusts threaten to wipe out thousands of people near her camp, Rosie returns to England in order to strike up support and raise money for the cause. This book will keep you interested and perhaps get you motivated to make a change in your daily routine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Viva la Cause Celeb!	2001-02-20

Everyone at some point in their life has thought what if, just for one day they could be in so-and-so's shoes. This book delightfully explores that possibility. It begins with the strange coincidence that two very different women, both named Nancy Stern, live in the same apt. building. When Nancy Stern the school teacher decides to pose as Nancy Stern the celebrity journalist, wacky shennanigans ensue leading to a murder. The characters are extremely well laid out and the plot is not at all predictable. I read this book at the beach last week and could not put it down. I HAD to know what would unfold for Nancy! You'll want to know, too.	2001-02-20

After reading the Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love last year, I thought it was the cat's meow. When I found out the second book was coming out, I was first in line! I didn't think it would be possible for Jill Conner Browne to do it, but God Save the Sweet Potato Queens is just as well-written and witty as her first novel. I found myself chuckling a lot and have passed the book on to a friend to read.<br />Throughout the book (when you can stop yourself from giggling at the wacky anecdotes concerning all the 'Tammys') there are interesting tips, new sweet potato queens' slang terms, and of course fabulous recipes! If you liked the first book, you'll love this one, too. If you haven't read either of them, you're missing out bless your heart....	2001-02-20

I enjoyed reading Jemima and finished the novel within a day and a half. Every spare moment I had, I would pick this book up.<br />Jemima is an introverted overwreight twenty-something at the  onset of this book. She's slowly trying to come out of her shell and makes  two close friends. As her confidence begins to soar she starts to lose  weight and that's when things get interesting....<br />The pages pass quickly  because the writing flows so well. The author has done an excellent job in  presenting her characters and their actions. Overall I would recommend this  to most of my friends, because it's a delight to see how things turn out  for Jemima.	2000-07-27

The main character, Fiona, is constructed so well that you feel as if you know her and her family because the detail given is so in depth.<br />Upon reading the  first chapter, I had to find out what was going to happen to Fiona. I  hungered to know whether her life would ever be settled. Fiona you see, is  a 30yr old waitress who is known as the town trouble maker. But reading  this novel from her perspective you see what a kind-hearted person she  really is and you will root for her. Although she sometimes does  questionable things and the reader knows what Fiona is doing is wrong, you  can't help but pray that things turn out for her.<br />I really, really  enjoyed this novel and plan to recommend it to all of my friends. The  brilliant writing will keep you hooked!	2000-07-24

Swell is approached almost as if you were reading beauty and love advice from the pages of a magazine instead of a book.  This makes it unique and fun.<br />The tips the  two authors provided on everything from how to throw a party/be a  successful host; to how to be lucky in life were interesting and sometimes  dead on. There are several little tid bits I intend to employ in my own  life.<br />If you are a 20-30ish female looking for a light read concerning  topics that affect you on an almost daily basis; pick up SWELL.  It's most  enjoyable.	2000-07-17

If you need a little inspiration; you need to read this book. If you are searching for a book that makes you want to give back to your community or humanity; this is the one.<br />However, I do believe that if you have read  the first two novels from Dave's autobiographical trilogy A MAN NAMED DAVE  may be a little dissapointing. Pelzer's third installment was quite  redundant and gave way too many details about his recollections. At times  it was hard to get through a chapter because he droned on. Especially since  I had read many of the details in his past two novels.<br />But writing style  and repetitiveness aside, the message Dave is trying to convey is still  enlightening and clear. The human spirit is a glorious thing and it can  empower us to become better people and overcome gaping pot holes and bumps  in the roads of our lives.	2000-07-13

This is an incredible autobiographical novel about a foster child's life in search of a family.<br />This book is the second in Dave Pelzer's trilogy  about his life and the power of the human spirit to triumph over adversity.<br />The Lost Boy is written using the language of a young boy/teenager  depending on the time period that is being discussed. The story is sad, but  hopeful as Dave grows from a 12yr old boy into an 18 year old adult. As the  story unfolds he goes through several foster homes in the search for a  place to call home and a family he can finally grow attached to. It's an  inspiring read and I would recommend it for anyone of any age.	2000-07-10

Although I read this book quickly and enjoyed it; I'm only giving it three stars. Why?  you may be asking yourself. Because the novels I've been reading recently such as Bridget Jones by Helen Fielding and Getting Over  It by Anna Maxted are MUCH, MUCH better.  There are several reasons for  this. Ms. Olson's secondary characters are never completely developed. Her  story is lacking. There is no balance in the plot. I found myself becoming  disinterested after the first half of the book.  Although I related in many  aspects to the main character's life, I didn't find myself caring about  what happened to her.  If you're looking for a witty book about a late 20's  early 30's modern woman with a little more zest I would highly recommend  Bridget Jones or Getting Over It.  Stil, Welcome to my planet is a decent  read. Just don't expect to be totally engrossed in it.	2000-07-03

How utterly refreshing to read a novel about a believable, realistic female character and her daily follies.  I have a lot of girlfriends who are exactly like the main character, Helen Bradshaw. Also, I was able to  indentify with some of her daily struggles.  This is a funny, fictional  account of one woman's issues with life, death, work, her mother, her  grandmother, friends, and boyfriends (or at some points, her lack thereof.)  It begins with Helen's life being instantly turned upside down by her  father's death. She spends the rest of the novel trying to piece her life  back together. Some of the things that happen along the way are really  humorous.  I highly recommend this book. It's a light, funny read for  anyone who is just looking for something to take to the beach this summer  or likes to relax with a good book, this is the one! Enjoy it, I did :)	2000-06-26

It envelopes you into the lives of the McBroom sisters and their grandmother as they deal with love, life, and death. It's serious, but also,  hilarious.<br />I found myself finishing this tome within 2 days because I  genuinely cared about the characters and their so-called 'family curse'.  Bad things kept happening to the sisters and their grandmother because of  the curse and I felt the need to see if any resolutions were  provided.<br />The author's writing style is laid-back and free flowing. Very  easy to follow....<br />American Pie is tasty and easy to digest, check it  out. Trust me, you'll be satisfied!	2000-06-19

I can't remember the last time I  giggled/laughed out loud so much at a book.<br />The life, love, and food  advice given by the leader of the Mississippi Sweet Potato Queens in this  tell all book are hilarious if not dead on. I kept imagining the queens  walking around in trashy lingerie and cooking up a storm, all the while  being intelligent, happy, and well, Queenly.<br />You get the sense that the  author truly knows how to live life to the fullest &amp; she's trying to  pass that on through her excellent writing skills. This tome will make you  want to liven up  your life; or at least whip up one of the heavenly  recipes provided.<br />The Sweet Potato Queens Book of Love is truly a joy to  read.

I fully intend to read the other two novels in this trilogy by Dave Pelzer. He is truly an amazing man and a skilled author.<br />This firt book in the series is told through Dave's memories of what it was like to be an abused child, mentally and physically. The reader learns not only of the  horrific feats Dave's mother put him through, but also of the mental trauma  he suffered as he slowly lost the support of his father. He was the  scapegoat of his family (he had several brothers who were not abused at  all). But one day the teachers at his school decided to put their jobs on  the line to save Dave and put an end to his suffering.<br />A gripping  sometimes disturbing novel.

Although this story is moving and well written; the initial chapter in the novel gave too much away, too soon. I felt that since I knew of the impending doom that was to befall the main characters, there was no need  for further reading.  The tone is set as an obsessive investigation into  the lives of the 5 Lisbon Sisters. The premise is interesting and unique.  But, it's also disturbing. The investigating is being done by several  neighborhood boys who apparently have nothing better to do other than snoop  around the Lisbons' house, collecting memorabilia and ideas of what goes on  in the girls' minds. The boys are extremely obsessed with the beauty and  mystery behind the five sisters to a degree that is a little  disconcerting.<br />I'm interested to see the movie and how it will deal with  the delicate traumas that unfold, but I would not recommend this book to my  friends.	2000-05-16

Jerry Gentry studied the patients, nurses, and doctors that make up the Grady Hospital Maternity Ward in Atlanta. He follows several mothers on their journey through prenatal care, pregnancy,  and the births of their children. He then follows up after the babies are  born. I found this book compelling because it demonstrates every aspect of  its subjects' lives. You feel like you personally know the people  discussed. It is an emotional and monetarial journey of hardships for most  of the mothers involved. Being an Atlanta native this novel has given me  new respect for Grady hospital. A great ethnography for anyone interested  in the subject and/or social behavior.	2000-05-12

This is an easy to read book and it  will keep you entertained. The emotions of the main character are conveyed  perfectly and you almost understand exactly how she feels. I loved this  novel and have given it to my mom and my best friend to read as well. The  only negative thing I can say about this book is that I didn't particularly  like the ending.
