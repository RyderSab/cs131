US	51252920	RUKSP5GOG0J9C	0525948600	2583852	The Secret History of the Pink Carnation	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Great idea, wonderful hero, but awful heroine	Like many others, this book grabbed my intention because it promised a rollicking good adventure in the vein of the Scarlet Pimpernel. What I got was a pretty good adventure, some romance, and several trashy romance novel scenes thrown in, seemingly for good measure. <br /> <br />The story is framed by the narrative of Eloise Kelly, an American grad student researching in England to try and unmask the Pink Carnation. She goes through the personal papers of the Selwick-Alderly family and uncovers the story of Amy Balcourt, a spirited 19th century Frenchwoman living in England who dreams of avenging her parents' deaths by attempting daring rescues a la her heroes, the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Purple Gentian. She convinces her cousin, Jane, along with their chaperone Miss Gwen travel to France to visit her brother, but she secretly hopes to join the Gentian's league of rescuers. Along the way, Amy meets Lord Richard Selwick, the charming, booksmart aristocrat who is secretly the Purple Gentian. Their relationship basically reflects that of the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Neither one seems to like the other, but of course love is bubbling underneath. Adventures, mishaps, and romantic misunderstandings ensue, and the Purple Gentian finds himself with a rival: the aforementioned Pink Carnation (who isn't who you might guess right off the bat). <br /> <br />Overall, this book had a great premise. The mere mention of the Scarlet Pimpernel in the book jacket description was enough to get me to read it and there is a good amount of adventure and intrigue. Unfortunately, Miss Willig saddles the reader with possibly THE most annoying heroine ever conceived: Amy Balcourt. While well intentioned and yes, young, Amy nevertheless comes across as a little brat. Lord Richard Selwick, by contrast, is nearly as fantastic a character Sir Percy/the Pimpernel. He's intelligent, cunning, romantic, and all around dashing--you have to wonder why he falls head over heels in love with Amy. But, he does. And the ensuing scenes the author inserts are a touch graphic, but nothing shocking (though they are rather badly written). <br /> <br />Despite these criticisms, it is an enjoyable novel. I am definitely going to pick up the sequel when it comes out in December, and apparently the film rights have been optioned for this book. I hope Miss Willig will continue to write books like this, but with a few adjustments here and there.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-04

Naturally, the majority of the myths and legends surround the three main personalities: David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and William Barret Travis.    This book attempts to strip away all of the folklore that has become virtually synonymous with these three. Their lives are laid bare, showing the common reader that they were human, after all. The legendary Crockett had political troubles, Bowie was notorious for dealing heavily in land swindles and slavery, and Travis was pretty much a failure at everything before packing up and moving to Texas (unfortunately, leaving his family behind him in Alabama). Despite showing their flaws and shortcomings, however, the author does not attempt to undermine their brave stand at the Alamo. He maintains that they fought for what they believed in, and that makes them admirable.    This book is unique in that it is, essentially, a triple biography. There is not one complete section for each of the three subjects; rather, the book is written so that the chapters alternate between each of them. This provides the reader with a sense of where the other two were and what they were doing while maintaining a primary focus on the third. While it is quite a hefty tome, it is at the same time quite readable and enjoyable to boot. Davis clearly has done his homework and hopefully this will become one of the quintessential books on the Alamo.	2004-05-05
US	51252920	R1JWPVYXMK60HM	0803279027	479248303	A Time to Stand	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Great introduction to Alamo history	&quot;A Time to Stand&quot; is perhaps one of the best books ever written on the historic Battle of the Alamo. Walter Lord, a reporter turned non-fiction writer, focuses mainly on the general events that took place during the siege, rather than on specific character studies of the three main heroes (Travis, Bowie, Crockett), but that does not in any way tarnish the end result. His account is very vivid and detailed, and gives the reader a real sense of what it must have been like to be behind those old adobe walls. An good addition to the book is a fold-out map of the Alamo complex as it looked in 1836, plus various pictures and facsimiles of letters sprinkled throughout. A highly recommended read and wonderful introduction to the real story of the Alamo.	2004-04-29

I bought it, thinking it would prove a different kind of Alamo read. The authors obviously did a lot of research for this book and came up with some pretty chilling, apparently true stories. A few that grabbed me the most was the appearance of a man dressed in buckskins appearing next to a display case and then vanishing; the other was the story that Davy Crockett's picture would hang sideways without anyone being able to reach it, and finally the ghostly re-enactment of the death of a defender. The only weakness the book has is the apparent lack of a proofreader. There are numerous mistakes (mainly in spelling/grammar) that should have been corrected.	2004-04-25

He was playing Col. William Barret Travis, and I remember thinking, \\"Wow! He's pretty good.\\" It was some years later that I encountered \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\". Again, I was struck by how well Harvey handled the role, this time of a brainwashed assassin. He now seems to be almost a one-hit wonder (he was nominated for an Oscar only once, for \\"Room at the Top\\"). <br />This biography by Anne Sinai, Harvey's sister-in-law, reveals a great deal about his brief but unquestionably \\"colorful\\" life. While it is interesting to see how he rose up from an obscurity in a Jewish community in South Africa, it is also easy to see why many people who worked with him ended up severely disliking him. His personality (especially in his early life) was a mixture of cut-throat ambition and downright arrogance, and he was known for leading a very extravagant lifestyle. But on the flip side, he also could be funny, generous, and caring. And there's no denying he had talent. The irony lies in the fact that, despite striving for the top, he never really managed to stake his claim there. <br />The book is fairly long and isn't a light read, but it is very well researched and written. I would have liked more information about his experiences working on a few films--namely \\"The Alamo\\"; Col. Travis will always remain my favorite of his roles--but Sinai provides a good chunck of information nonetheless. For those who are interested in the olden days of Hollywood stars, or (like me) are interested in an actor the world seems to have forgotten, then this book is worth your while.	2004-03-18

Rather than re-tread familiar territory with a primary focus on the composer, Stephanie Cowell instead spotlights his future wife, Constanze, and her sisters. She injects personality into these characters, who before mostly stood in the background. In characterizing Mozart, she breaks from the idea made famous in \\"Amadeus\\", that he was nothing more than an irresponsible man-child. Here, he is a young genius, full of passion and determination to make his way in the world. The period and historical details are excellent, even though some key dates are rearranged (the author acknowledges this herself in the back of the book). One thing I particularly admired was Cowell's restraint from using lewd depictions of sexual acts, something that I find all too often in modern historical fiction. If you're like me and are a huge fan of Mozart, or enjoy historical fiction (or just a great read), then I thoroughly recommend \\"Marrying Mozart\\".	2004-03-08

When Louann ruins a shopping trip with Amy and her new friend Ellen, Amy has a confrontation with her mother that results in Amy's running away from home. While visiting her aunt Clare in her great-grandparents' old farmhouse, Amy discovers an old dollhouse in the attic--an exact replica of the house they are staying in. When mysterious lights turn on and the dolls begin to move around by themselves, Amy wonders what could be causing it. Her curiousity eventually leads her to uncover a long-buried family secret.<br />The Dollhouse Murders is an excellent supernatural mystery aimed at younger readers. Wright manages to insert just the right amount of suspense and creepiness without being too over-the-top or frightening. The importance of strong family relationships is a major theme in the story; an emphasis is placed on the relationship between sisters Amy and Louann in particular. Wright conveys Amy's frustration with her sister's condition as well as Louann's desire to be accepted. The dollhouse mystery helps Amy and Louann to grow closer together and for Amy to finally accept her sister as she is. Highly recommended.	2004-02-19

I found her longer novels, &quot;Cecilia&quot; and &quot;Camilla&quot; to be very enjoyable; ironically, her most famous work was a bit less so. She has a charming writing style, and has a voice all her own, but it doesn't seem to sparkle as much here. Written completely as a series of letters (the correct term is &quot;epistolary novel&quot;) the story is about a young woman's emergence into society in eighteenth century England. Her encounters with various characters are entertaining and amusing, especially the episodes between Madame Duval and the Captain. However, the novel dips into redundancy when Evelina constantly explains to her beloved guardian, Rev. Villars, about her embarassments. True, this has to do with Burney's intent, but for a modern reader it can grow repetitive. One can see the influence Burney had on Jane Austen's writing. A good read if you are interested in this period, early women writers, or Jane Austen.	2003-08-22

It's the first book I have struggled with in a while. And it's not because it's hard to read; far from it. The characters are, simply put, not interesting. I didn't care for a single one of them, not even the &quot;detective&quot; of the story, Robert Audley, or the &quot;enchanting&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; heroine herself, Lady Audley. There was some good bits of suspense, and a few bits of mystery, but because of the flat characters this really did little to compensate.	2003-06-12

The premise sounded interesting; alas, it plays out poorly. Holmes is so far out of character in most of these that it's not even funny. Yes, these stories are supposed to be other characters' views of him, but they could have at least retained some spirit of Doyle's original. Instead many writers take Holmes' character and run with it. For instance, the story involving Irene Adler's relationship with Holmes is not only unoriginal but ridiculous. I hope that there will be a new collection of pastiches, one that vastly outweighs this one in the quality department.	2003-05-11

The story and characters are so captivating that it just drives you onward and onward until the end. The Forsytes themselves are an intriguing lot--especially poor Soames. There's an instinct for the reader to dislike him, and yet Galsworthy shows that he has true human feelings, just like anyone else. His love for Irene and his passionate desire to be loved back is heartbreaking. The morals that Galsworthy incorporates makes the book complete, making it a true monument of literature.	2002-11-09

Sadly, he did not have a chance to do so before he died at the age of 35. Whether or not you have actually played Mozart's work in concert or just love to listen to it, this book is one of the best you will ever come across. It shows the reader Mozart's personal thoughts on just about everything, from music to religion to society to the &quot;other arts&quot;. Not only that, but it offers recollections from friends and relatives, including his sister Nannerl and his wife Constanze. The snippets of letters are mingled with fascinating editorial ancedotes about Mozart's life. The man revealed in this book is a far cry from the childish genius in the film &quot;Amadeus&quot;, the vision that has too often been the definition of the man in recent years. The only fault I found with the book is that the editor too often reused the same quotes over and over in different sections of the book, and some of the notes on the correspondance were confusing, but other than that this book is probably my favorite Mozart reference.	2002-08-14

There were some interesting and familiar aspects to it, but overall the writing was rather flat. It was dull and repetitive, and there was no sense that the author really tried to perk up his prose. Yes, it is based on Beethoven's life (hence the interesting aspect) but the author tends to drift into the more boring realm. Plus, he adds some unnecessarily explicit sex scenes, of the type that should certainly warrant a warning label on the cover.	2002-07-04

It is classic Sherlock at his best.

This book provides great background information on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a chronology of the life  of Doyle and the &quot;life&quot; of Holmes and Watson, plus plenty of  full-color pictures, and even info on the many different portrayals of  Holmes on stage and TV, from William Gillette to Jeremy Brett.	2000-03-31

I read it all in one day, because I wanted to see what happened next. If  you like her Holmes novels, you'll probably also like &quot;Who Killed  Blanche DuBois?&quot;, which I also recommend.	2000-03-19

Since then, it has become one of my favorites. Although it's intended for a certain age range, it still is a great read for teenagers.	2000-03-18

Some of the writings in this book were better than those in the first version, and some weren't that great. One of my favorites was  &quot;The Adventure of the Second Violet&quot;--I thought it was very  clever!	2000-03-11

It's fun to read, has great characters, and good suspense at the end. I recommend this book (and all her others)!	2000-01-25

It was an Italian tale written by an English authoress, who did a very fine job of it. Unfortunately, this book is not as recognized as some of Mary Shelley's other work, but  hopefully it will be soon.	1999-08-04

What stands out about this particular anthology is that it traces Holmes' career from the very beginning, and leads up right to the  very end. All of the stories were unique and interesting in their own way.  An added bonus is a list at the back of the book describing more Holmes  books written by modern authors.	1998-12-12
