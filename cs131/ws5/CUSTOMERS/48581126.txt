It tells its scientific classification and habits.<br /><br />It is the section on the history of the Cod fisheries that I find to be most fascinating.  The Cod is shown as the lure which drew the first Europeans to North America.  Rapidly becoming a staple in the diets of many, Cod became a pillar of he economies of several regions as well as a major commodity in the fabled Triangle Trade.  Access to Cod became a causa bellae, which it remains to our day, and a factor in treaty negotiations.<br /><br />As the history enters more modern times, the narrative focuses more on the depletion of the Cod stocks.  The effects of the failure of the Cod stock on fishing communities in the North Eastern United States and Maritime Canada, as well as on British Cuisine, and on the take of other species, make for interesting reading.  Cod is identified as the major natural resource of Iceland.  The shifting of national policies along with the extent of offshore fishing rights is closely studied.  The book concludes with a collection of regional Cod recipes.<br /><br />Often we think of human history as an exclusively human story.  \\"Cod\\" reminds us of the interdependence between man and the sea's creatures.	2005-10-13

Through the first campaign in California to the second term in the White House,  Deaver advanced from campaign staffer to the office adjacent to the Oval Office.<br /><br />Deaver introduces the reader to the private Reagan.  We see Reagan as he lives with Nancy, works with his staff and deals with his adversaries.  Deaver portrays Reagan as knowing his core values and adhering to them.  Even in controversy, such as the Bitburg decision, Reagan's loyalty to his friends remained unshaken.<br /><br />A self identified member of the family, Deaver provides an insight into Nancy's role in protecting and leading Reagan through his life.<br /><br />In the story of his own return to the Reagans after Deaver's downfall, Deaver presents a loyal, concerned Reagan, unlike some others who portray Reagan as dumping cohorts who are no longer useful to him.  Finally, through Michael Deaver, we see the declining Reagan in the early stages of Alzheimer's.<br /><br />\\"A Different Drummer\\" is a sympathetic portrayal of a confident, steady leader by one of his closest associates.  It is a valuable tool with which to uncover the real Ronald Reagan.	2005-10-11

It is well organized and written.  Like Ike, it is not flashy, but competent and gets the job done.<br /><br />This book is organized by topics, which largely follow chronological order.  The story begins with the erosion of his long stated unwillingness to enter politics.  Although his entry was restrained, he eventually became totally committed.  The details of the campaign followed by the assembly of the administration give the reader an insight into what really went on during the course of a 50s campaign.  Ike's account of the post election meeting between himself and his staff with their counterparts in the outgoing Truman administration provides an interesting contrast with Truman's report of the same meeting.<br /><br />The chapters about the actual administration take the reader into the summits in Bermuda and Geneva., through his heart attack and the initial plans for the 1956 campaign.<br /><br />Much of Eisenhower's attention is devoted to overseas challenges, including the end of the War in Korea, attempted Communist takeovers in Guatemala and Iran, early stage negotiations over the British garrison at Suez, a potential East-West flash point between Italy and Yugoslavia involving jurisdiction over Trieste and issues relating to the defense of Formosa, which focused largely on decisions concerning the defense of Quemoy, the Matsus and other off shore islands.  Ike reports a carefully thought out strategy to achieve the defense of the Free World without leading it over the precipice to nuclear war over relatively insignificant islands.  His extensive description of discussions concerning considered assistance to the French in Indo-China lays the groundwork for later American intervention.<br /><br />While defending against foreign challenges, Eisenhower does not neglect domestic issues, including the budget, taxes, internal security, McCarthyism, defense, Civil Rights and internal improvements including the Interstate Highway System and the St. Lawrence Seaway.  Efforts to insure internal security were premised on the recognition that public employment is a privilege, not a right.  Ike explains his plan to ignore McCarthy and let him self-destruct, rather than to extend his influence by giving him more headlines.<br /><br />Eisenhower avoids some troublesome topics, such as reported hard feelings and limited respect between himself and Nixon.  While not revealing any headline generating secrets, he does provide some insight into incidents which had not previously occurred to me.  He does admit his deletion of praise for General Marshall from a speech in Milwaukee.  He also points out that he had issued a strong defense of Marshall a few days before and that the Wisconsin trip had been scheduled in violation of his specific orders.  Harry Truman depicts the deletion of the praise of Marshall as despicable cowardice.  Upon reading Eisenhower's account, I wondered how many presidential candidates have made equally embarrassing concessions to political expediency.  Much ridicule has been directed against Ike's garbled syntax, particularly during press conferences.  He mentioned that he was the first president to allow direct quotes and broadcast and telecast of press conferences.  While Ike was clearly no golden tongued, silver throated orator, the lack of precedent for press conference preparation leads to an understanding as to why he sounded like he did.  Try looking at a transcript of things that you say!  I found that Ike's professed wish that the atomic bomb not be used to end World War II contrasted sharply with his willingness to include the nuclear option in plans for the defense of NATO, South Korea and Formosa.<br /><br />As memoirs go, \\"Mandate For Change\\" is very good.

Through them he tells the story saga of the American scenes on Mars' stage.  Although he occassionally gets down to the common soldier, sailor and airman, this book deals largely with the leaders, consistent with Ambrose's belief that nothing is inevitable.  Things happen because people make them happen.<br /><br />This book begins with the siege of Vicksburg, focusing largely on Ulysses S Grant.  It continues with a very unflattering consideration of George Armstrong Custer.  The sections on Dwight Eisenhower's relationship with George Patton and his role in the establishment of NATO make interesting reading.  Ike is depicted as playing an indispensable role in laying a firm foundation for NATO, a role which I had not previously appreciated.  The story of Douglas MacArthur also holds the readers interest.<br /><br />I found the section on atrocities to be particularly interesting.  Ambrose skillfully contrasts those, such as Lt. Calley, who broke under pressure, with others, such as Meriwether Lewis, who did not break.<br /><br />The political leadership of FDR is examined for its failure to prepare America for World War II, before recovering in preparation for D-Day.  Nixon's Christmas 1972  bombing of Hanoi is presented as being more directed at our reluctant South Vietnamese allies than our North Vietnamese enemies.<br /><br />From individuals, Ambrose broadens the perspective to consider changes which World War II brought to Main Street America.  His assessment of the Cold War, how it was fought, whether it was necessary, who won what and whether it was worth the cost lead the reader to make his own analysis.  The conclusion on wars of the Twenty-First Century contain stimulating speculations, even though some of which were proven right and others wrong in the early phases War on Terrorism.<br /><br />Throughout this fairly short book, Ambrose educates the readers and invites us to draw our own conclusions, without hesitating to share his conclusions with us.  It is certainly a worthwhile read.t this fairly short book, Ambrose educates the readers and invites us to draw our own conclusions, without hesitating to share his conclusions with us.

As the premier figure among the Western Allies, his story and observations are crucial to an understanding of the Great Crusade.<br /><br />Ike takes the reader along with him through each stage of the Crusade.  We view events from a perspective which lets us see aspects which we otherwise might have missed.  Having attracted attention for his performance in Army maneuvers in Louisiana in 1940, Ike was called to Washington immediately after Pearl Harbor because of his recent experience in the Philippines.  He was immediately assigned to work on plans for the Pacific.  At this point the reader is reminded that, in contrast to the later Germany First Policy,  the American public, for a time, screamed for revenge on Japan before dealing with Germany.<br /><br />Assigned to command Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa in 1942, Ike was charged with obtaining Allied Cooperation and was plunged into the morass of French politics.  The disappointing involvement with Gen. Giraud presented an intra-allied problem, as did cooperation of Adm. Darlan, who while too helpful to rebuff, brought with him the stigma of association with a collaborator.  The age-old Arab-Jewish hostility further complicated the administration of the liberated territory.<br /><br />With North Africa cleared out, Ike was charged with the conquest of Sicily.  Management of the Patton-Montgomery rivalry was a major challenge of the campaign.  Success having been achieved, the Patton slapping incident forced Ike to reprimand a close friend while threatening to deprive him of one of his most effective Army commanders.<br /><br />Speculation that Ike would return to the Washington as Chief Of Staff while Gen. Marshall commanded Overlord, the invasion of Europe, distracted Ike's attention from problems at hand.  Ike's eventual appointment to command Overlord forced him to leave the Mediterranean while the Italian campaign was still in doubt.  Upon arrival in England he immediately switched gears to plan the size, timing, supply and location of the invasion of France.<br /><br />With the invasion ashore, Ike skillfully managed his coalition of impetuous commanders in their march across Europe.  Ike brings the reader into the thought processes and conferences leading to decisions on the liberation of Paris, Operation Market-Garden (\\"A Bridge Too Far\\") and the Battle of The Bulge.<br /><br />Americans are familiar with Patton's claim that, with supplies, he could capture Berlin and win the war.  Ike relates that Monty bothered him with similarly impractical suggestions.  He then explains why the proposals were doomed to failure.  Spirited arguments with the British over Project Anvil (Invasion of Southern France) come within the reader's vision through Ike's eyes.<br /><br />The greatest criticism of Ike's wartime leadership is reserved for questions about whether the Western Allies should have advanced further to limit the Red Army's area of occupation.  Ike assesses the claims and presents support for his decisions.<br /><br />After V-E Day, Ike's role shifted more into that of a statesman as he attempted to obtain cooperation with the Russians over the administration of occupied Germany.<br /><br />Some things come clearly through the pages of this book.  The reader is constantly impressed with the importance of supplies, bringing to mind the adage that \\"Amateurs speak of tactics, professionals speak of logistics.\\"  Despite later controversies, Ike's admiration for Gen. George Marshall is made clear on the pages of this book.  Written in 1948, I find the statement that Ike disagreed with many of FDR's domestic policies to be surprising and a hint of his later political initiatives.  \\"Crusade In Europe\\" is written in a very clear, easyto read and follow, style.  It never becomes bogged down in boring details.  Among memoirs, this is a gem.a very clear, easy to read and follow, style.  It never becomes bogged down in boring details.

Author Alfred Wellnitz is the grandson of Karl Mueller.<br /><br />Recently discharged from the Prussian Army after the Franco-Prussian War, Karl takes leave of his family in Prussia and sails for America.  Wellnitz guides while we follow Karl along his journey.  We follow as he uses skills learned in his brother's Prussian butcher shop in his first American job at a  butcher shop in Baltimore and as he finds his first American love in English class in Baltimore.  We then follow him through the packing houses of Chicago, a logging camp in Wisconsin and a gold rush in Dakota.<br /><br />There is something for everyone in this book.  It provides a link to the ancestors to every descendant of a Nineteenth Century immigrant.  The section set in Chicago is reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\".  The Dakota scenes provide a little of the wild west.<br /><br />As I read this book, I keep asking myself, \\"How good is it?\\"  I found the answer in my own responses.

It tells us much about his military and political careers, particularly beginning with the lead up to World War II.  Throughout this book, author Peter Lyon focuses on the public issues which confronted Ike.  While his family are mentioned now and then, very little is said about their relationships.<br /><br />This book gives insights into the events and personalities Ike encountered during his time on the world stage.  Ike's belief that the Chief of Staff should not become involved in something as vulgar as a riot contrasted with Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur's high profile involvement in the rout of the Bonus Army.  Ike's transfer to the War Department immediately after Pearl Harbor injected him into issues such as those dealing with priority between Europe and the Pacific, choices of America's first combat theatre and military equipment procurement needs, such as the development of LSTs.  Ike's command of Operation Torch, the North African invasion and Overlord and its follow-up operations in Europe.<br /><br />After V-E Day many lined up to encourage Ike to run for President in 1948, including President Truman and Jimmy Roosevelt.  Ultimately it became apparent that Ike's views on domestic issues placed him firmly in the Republican camp.<br /><br />An interesting interlude in Ike's career was his term as President of Columbia University.  Although the appointment of prominent figures to presidential offices was a collegiate trend at the time, Ike was a poor fit and the relationship was awkward from both sides.<br /><br />When the narrative reaches 1952 it focuses on Ike's entry into and practice of politics.  Without being overtly critical, Lyon presentation of Ike's presidency is generally unflattering.  He gives the impression that Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles created problems and lost opportunities as a result of their preoccupation with Communism in the practice of Foreign Relations.  After giving Ike credit for ending the Korean War, Lyon faults him and Dulles for fomenting revolt against hostile governments in Iran and Guatemala with the allegations that the governments were pro-Communist, the alienation of Arab sentiment and the abandonment of the Hungarian insurgents after lending encouragement to their uprising.  Dulles' world view is portrayed as having misconstrued nationalistic uprising into theatres of Communist aggression.  The failure to provide air support to the French at Dien Bien Phu is portrayed as a failure of resolve, without espousing a clear position, on Lyon's part, as to whether intervention would have made a positive impact.  In relations with the Soviets, Eisenhower and Dulles are portrayed as being out of touch with the Soviets and out of sync with wiser allies.  Lyon defines Ike's domestic challenges as Sen. McCarthy and Civil Rights and finds him lacking in each instance.  In the choice of a successor, Ike is portrayed as indecisive and, ultimately, rejected.<br /><br />This book was written in 1974, before Ike's reputation revived.

Covering all theatres and major combatants, the reader is treated to a thorough introduction to the strategy, personalities and equipment involved.<br /><br />Col. Boyne has again written in a very engaging and easily understood manner.  Much of this writing consists of description of aircraft, including their strengths and weaknesses.  My knowledge of aircraft has generally been limited to the models I had assembled in my youth, several of which I enjoyed reading about.  I have never studied aircraft in sufficient depth to really follow their ins and outs, but Col. Boyne writes in such a way that I never became bored.  I appreciate the way he weaves the story of the air war into the bigger story of the overall war.  I finished this book with a feeling that I had a better understanding, not only of the air war, but of the ground and naval wars also.  I was pleased to find some of my lingering questions about World War II, such as why Japan attacked the U. S. and European colonies to the south rather than trying to finish off the Soviet Union first, and what would have happened if they had attacked the U.S.S.R., addressed in this narrative.<br /><br />This book is great!

It is a combination of biography, technical manual and social and art history.<br /><br />The biography tells us of Michelangelo's life.  We meet his family and gain an understand his training, his financial standing and his artistic history.  I was surprised to learn that he was, primarily, a sculptor who was hired to build the tomb of Pope Julius II before being diverted into the ceiling project.  The popular image of Michelangelo laying on his back while painting the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel is repeatedly dismissed.<br /><br />The technical manual introduces the reader to the techniques employed in the creation of a fresco.  The explanations of the then existing practices relating to the drawing of the sketches on paper for transfer to the wet plaster and the array and qualities of the pigments available  make fascinating reading.  The author brings the reader into the team of artists and assistants who made this work happen.  The growth of the picture across the ceiling is shown not only as expansion from side to side, but also as the growth of an artist who adjusted his techniques as he viewed his work from the perspective of its admirers.<br /><br />The social history places Michelangelo's work in the world of his patron, Pope Julius II.  Julius was an amazing character, a warrior Pope who left his mark, not in the sanctity of his Church but in the magnificence of its churches.<br /><br />The art history walks the reader across the scenes of the ceiling.  I have never been to Rome, but after reading this book it seems that one could spend weeks trying to take the whole ceiling in.  The author also places this work in its artistic context, both in how it advanced what went before and how it became the standard for so much which followed.

The themes of this extensive collection are almost exclusively religious or related.<br /><br />Some of these poems are vary moving.  For the most part, although I am a great fan of John Paul The Great, I was generally disappointed in this book.  I suspect that the problem flows from the translation.  I am not criticizing the translator, but suspect that poetry is, generally, difficult to translate without loosing much.  I suspect that much beauty was left in Polish.  This work is worth studying, but the reader must be prepared to be satisfied with intermittent satisfaction.	2005-06-03

Powell Davies treats the reader to an in-depth study of St. Paul, both as an historical figure and his place in the early Church.  I understand that Davies was a prominent clergyman in the 1950s.<br /><br />In this book Davies melts the mists which shroud the memories of the early Church in an attempt to find out what really happened.  He explores Paul's origins as well as the origins of the early, often rival, Christian communities.  He explores the complicated relationships of Paul, Peter, James and Stephen.  He explores some of the meanings the meanings behind Paul's writings as well as the influences on Paul and the development of Christian doctrine.  He explains the differing thought patterns of Paul's Greek and Hebrew speaking contemporaries and how their differences are reflected in Christian doctrine.  He relates legends of Gnostic religions of the day which, in some ways, were very similar to the story of Jesus.  Davies compares the stories contained in the Acts Of The Apostles with events related in Paul's epistles.  He points out the events which we cannot place in his life, those which are reconcilable among the sources and those which seem to be impossible.<br /><br />When reading an in-depth study such as this the reader is often tempted to wonder what is really true.  Ultimately, as Davies admits, some things we cannot know.  He also points out that we can never understand Paul's teachings in exactly the same way that Paul did.  Each reader must take a book like this and incorporate its lessons with those derived from other sources in formulating our own understanding of Christianity.  \\"The First Christian\\" certainly presents a thought provoking point of view.	2005-06-02

Here we learn little of Madison's youth and upbringing.  Although Dolly plays a role in this book, it is a relatively minor part.<br /><br />This book explains Madison's role in the development and ratification of the Constitution, including his authorship of some of the Federalist Papers.  The narration of Madison's leadership in the early Democratic-Republican Party can change the reader's view of history.  Whereas we usually think of Thomas Jefferson as founder of the Democratic-Republican Party, Rutland makes a strong case that it was really Madison who united and organized the party from his seat in the House of Representatives.  Much as Alexander Hamilton founded the party which elected John Adams, so it can be said that James Madison founded the party which chose Thomas Jefferson as its first standard bearer.<br /><br />Rutland progresses through Madison's term as Secretary of State and even puts a favorable spin on his two terms as president.  This is no easy task, considering that the British burned the White House and Capitol on his watch.<br /><br />Rutland follows the wind down of Madison's career with his post-White House collaboration in the establishment of the University of Virginia.<br /><br />I appreciate books which enable me to see things differently.  This book meets that test.  I had always thought of Madison as, so to speak, Jefferson's underling and less talented successor.  Through Robert Rutland's eyes we see him as one of the most influential and talented men of the early Republic.  Madison comes across, as a practical political operative, the equal of Hamilton and, in result at least, perhaps his better.  In the title, Rutland tells us that James Madison is The Founding Father.  In the book he proves it.	2005-05-29

Commencing with the beginnings of the Contemporary Church during the reign of Leo XIII, Prof. Burkle-Young takes the reader through the Vatican and into the conclaves.  He does this by reporting the illness and death of each Pontiff as well as the influence of each on the evolution of the College of Cardinals.  This is fascinating history.<br /><br />The ability of this book to explode many of the \\"facts\\" which we all know helps us see the Pontiffs in different lights and makes this book a winner!<br /><br />The first election to be related in detail is that of Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli) in 1939.  Given the prevailing world situation at that time, the selection of Pacelli, the career diplomat over a papabili with pastoral experience, is very understandable.  I remember Pius XII as I was starting school, but I see him much differently through the author's eyes.  I was not surprised that what little he says about Pius and the Nazis reflects well on Pius.  Two topics which he covered in great detail did come as surprises, one portraying Pius as a wise seer and the other as a flake.  He is the only person of whom I have heard to have been disabled by hiccups.  I remember hearing the story of how, when he seemed to be dying, Jesus appeared to him and told him that he would recover.  I had no idea that the cause of the illness was the third administration of a cell injection treatment by a quack.  The story of the disgusting decay of his body before burial raises serious questions as to the proficiency of the Vatican in 1958.  In contrast to his bizarre judgment in medical treatment, the author portrays Pius XII as the architect of the ascension of a non-Italian to the chair of Peter.  It took four successors, but he is portrayed as the first to envision that as a goal to be advanced by the internationalization of the College of Cardinals.  I had heard that Cardinal Montini had been sent to Milan for pastoral experience needed to make him a serious papabile.  I was surprised to read that he was exiled from the Vatican because he lost Pius' confidence.<br /><br />John XXIII (Angelo Roncalli) brought his surprises also.  I  had always understood that he was a dark horse whose name was advanced after a deadlock developed between conservatives and liberals.  As Prof. Burkle-Young presents it, Cardinal Roncalli was a front runner from the start.  After his election he called Vatican II which provided a forum for progressives to extend their influence in the Church.  Although he preferred an Italian  pope, his main contribution to the electoral process was that he commenced the expansion of the College of Cardinals.<br /><br />Prof.  Burkle-Young comes down hardest on Paul VI (Giovanni Montini).  Although he was the only non-cardinal in centuries believed to have received votes in a conclave (1958), he is characterized as generally a failure and some of his major reforms as little more than power grabs.  The imposition of age limits on Cardinal electors, bishops and Curia officials, while seeming sensible to me, is presented as an effort to rid Paul of meddlesome priests before mortality would have done so.  Paul's concentration of power in himself in the name of collegiality is presented as inconsistent and an unfortunate legacy.  He does explain how Paul managed to mold the College to his liking by eliminating his opponents and elevating his own choices.<br /><br />The election of John Paul I (Albino Luciani is presented as a rather bizarre bungle.  Paul's favorite, Cardinal Benelli, too unpopular to be elected himself, served as a Grand Elector by mobilizing support for Cardinal Luciani as the Italian candidate.  Almost incredible are the unfamiliarity of the electors of Luciani's fragile health and Luciani's failure to recognize what was being done around him.  His own self doubts seem more intense than those of other pontiffs.  Ultimately, the election of  John Paul I was the outcome of Paul's molding of the College.  An interesting fact was the mention that \\"Giampaolo\\" is a form of \\"John Paul\\" in Northeastern Italy suggesting that Luciani may not have realized that he was choosing a double name.<br /><br />The death of John Paul I left the Italians with no suitable candidate.  Force to let himself be presented, Benelli fell short, creating an opening for Karol Wojtyla of Poland.<br /><br />Throughout his reign, John Paul II pursued his policy of internationalizing the College of Cardinals.  Burkle-Young uses this portion of the narrative to lay the ground work for his predictions for the next conclave which, we now know, occurred in April 2005.  I will tell you that this portion of the book focuses on several names which came up in the reports on the conclave.  Expecting a conclave in 1999, several of the Cardinals who he expected to play key rolls were either dead or superannuated when it finally came.  Read and find out for yourself how well he did.<br /><br />When reading a book like this one is tempted to ask \\"How does he know that?\\" and \\"Is that really right?\\"  With the requirements of secrecy, I wonder how reliable all of his details of the conclaves really are.  How did he get exact vote totals?  How does he know who said what if they were all bound to secrecy? I did catch one error, when he said that the St. Louis Cardinals, baseball and football, took their names in anticipation of the elevation of John Cardinal Glennon.  I know that that was not the inspiration for the baseball team, and that the Chicago Cardinals did not move to St. Louis until 13 years after Glennon's death.<br /><br />Such minor inconsistencies not withstanding, \\"Passing The Keys\\" is fascinating reading.  It is a must for anyone with an interest in recent papal history.Paul I was the outcome of Paul's molding of the College.

He shows that planning for the postwar war world began while the guns were still hot.<br /><br />Bechloss demonstrates the intricate interplay of domestic and foreign personalties.  The most prominent figure in the book is Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morganthau.  Morganthau, although a non-practicing Jew, became the foremost inside spokesman for intervention to save Jews threatened with extermination as well as for his plan, modestly named the \\"Morganthau Plan\\", to reduce Germany to an agricultural nation, presumably unable to rise to threaten the world again.  We read of the interests of Britain and Russia as personified in the personalities of Churchill and Stalin.  The issue of partition of Germany into either a few states or to something resembling pre-1870 Germany is viewed from several angles.  Other issues such as reparations and the zones of occupation are explored in detail.<br /><br />I enjoy books which enable me to see an issue or a period of history in a light different from the way it had appeared before.  This book does that.  It gives the reader a deeper understanding of the issues and personalities involved in winning the peace in the wake of destruction.

This fact filled book reads like a novel.  Stephen Ambrose covers a story with a breath of the continent.  He addresses all aspects of the project including choices of routes, construction challenges, labor, financing and the race for government subsidies.<br /><br />Ambrose explains how the transcontinental railroad interacted with so many of the issues and personalities in mid 19th century America.  One of the road's greatest boosters was the railroad lawyer from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln.  Ambrose makes the case that the North-South rivalry prevented construction of the road until the Civil War withdrew Southern interests from political debate.  Surrender at Appomatox freed an army of young laborers to lay the track among the competing communities.<br /><br />Ambrose delves into the economics of the project, emphasizing the role of the Army.  The increased mobility available to the Army resulted in tremendous cost savings to the government, ensuring the support of Generals Grant and Sherman..<br /><br />Alternative funding schemes from government construction and ownership through private construction, either with or without government subsidy, are examined.  The fact was that the government was the only organization capable of financing the road.  Contrary to the image of railroad finance as a corrupt cash grab, Ambrose shows it as a win-win arrangement.  Ambrose points out that, between the savings to the Army, interest paid on government bonds and increased value of government retained land, the project turned a large profit to the government.  The race to lay track in order to get the most bonds and land grants spurred the companies to complete the roads with unanticipated haste.<br /><br />I like books that help me see things in a differently.  Ambrose reminds us that, before the development of the railroad, neither people, goods nor information could travel much faster than they had in Caesar's time..  Before this book, I had not realized the connection between the Civil War and the railroad.  Now I see it both from the perspective of the dominance of Northern interests and the availability of manpower.  The idea that all rails, nails and some other materials for the Central Pacific had to be transported to California from the East Coast, either around Tierra del Fuego or across Panama boggles the mind but, on reflection, is understandable.  Descriptions of the tremendous construction projects of  bridges and trestles demands our admiration.  The tremendous shortening in the time needed for transportation shows this project to truly alter America's self image.  \\"Nothing Like It In The World\\" changes my view of this crucial episode in America's history.

She tells the traditional stories of his courtship and life long love affair with Bess, his life on the farm, his service in World War I and his unsuccessful haberdashery venture.  She continues on through his entry into politics and involvement with the Pendergast machine.  The senate campaigns of 1934 and 1940 and the choice for Vice President set the stage for Harry Truman's role of a lifetime.  His succession to the Presidency started a dizzying sequence of crises including the founding of the United Nations, the use of the atomic bomb and the surrender of Japan.  He then lead the country through a rash of post war strikes and inflation leading to Democratic defeat in the 1946 Congressional elections.  Rebounding, Truman fought off the Berlin Blockade and won a stunning upset victory in the 1948 elections.  In his second term he restored the decaying White House, was harassed by Joseph McCarthy and had his presidency redefined by the Korean War.  Deciding not to seek reelection, Truman began his unsuccessful effort to mold Adlai Stevenson into his successor.  After leaving the White House, Truman found most of his satisfaction in his family and in teaching others about government.<br /><br />I like this book for its intimate view of Harry Truman's life.  Margaret provides a perspective lacking in all other biographers.  Her view of family life and the quotes from Harry's diaries and letters make this book a unique delight.<br /><br />In dealing with aspects of Truman's life this book lacks the depth found in some other biographies.  In some respects, Margaret is a bit too strident in defense of her Father.  I recommend other works for an initial Truman biography and this one to deepen the reader's understanding of Harry.  Other books provide a better understanding of the historical Harry Truman.  Margaret provides an excellent introduction to her Dad.	2005-03-30

It is a thorough, well written narrative of a classic American life.  David McCollough displays a knack for telling a part of the story and moving on so deftly that the vignettes flow on like a river.  Born in Western Missouri into a family proud of its Southern heritage, Truman was molded by challenges and opportunities unique to his time and place.  A bright boy, Truman was limited first by near sightedness, and later by glasses which he could not afford to lose.  After moving into Independence for a quality high school education, he spent much of his early life working as a farmer near Grandview and in banks in Kansas City, where he met Arthur Eisenhower, brother of his successor. .<br /><br />In the army Truman established himself as a leader of men.  Like Theodore Roosevelt,  Truman would never have been president without his army service.  After service in a light artillery battery of the Missouri National Guard, Truman, with several reasons to avoid service in World War I, enlisted and rose to the rank of Captain in Battery D of the Second Battalion, 129th Field Artillery.  From training at Camp Donaphan through service in France and return to Kansas City, Truman earned the trust and affection of the men who would form the nucleus of his political support.<br /><br />1919 was a momentous year as Harry married his long time beau, Bess, and, with army buddy, Eddie Jacobson, opened the haberdashery of Truman & Jacobson. Although a hangout for veterans from Battery D, Truman & Jacobson fell victim to the recession and failed in 1922.<br /><br />Even before the haberdashery failed, a lifeboat arrived under the direction of another Battery D brother, Jim Pendergast.  Jim, the nephew of Boss Tom Pendergast and machine representative in eastern Jackson County, solicited Truman as the machine candidate for Eastern Judge of the County Court.  Not yet the dominant political power, the Pendergasts needed a popular veteran with a clean record in 1922 as badly as Truman needed them.  This enabled Truman to run with Pendergast backing, but not as the machine candidate.  After two years in office an alliance between a rival Democratic machine and the Republicans handed Truman his only electoral defeat.  In 1926 he was elected presiding judge where his political leadership was evident in road construction and a new courthouse, paid for by the bond issues which he introduced.<br /><br />Term limited by tradition, Truman was looking for a job in 1934.  After being passed over by Tom Pendergast for a Congressional seat and while considering a future run for governor, Jim the machine backing for the U. S. Senate.  Surviving another tough primary race, he won and began his career as the much scorned \\"Senator from Pendergast.\\"  Despite the handicaps of his background, Truman gradually won respect from his colleges.  The 1940 primary fight against Governor Stork, who he had helped win election in 1936, returned him to the Senate with new respect. Truman distinguished himself through The Truman Committee to Investigate The National Defense Effort.  Careful not to repeat the errors of the Civil War Committee On The Conduct Of The War, Truman worked tirelessly to save millions in defense costs.<br /><br />I had often wondered how, among all of the potential candidates for Vice-President, Truman was chosen.  The interplay between Roosevelt, Henry Wallace, James Byrnes, Truman and behind the scenes Democratic operatives is one of the most interesting parts of the book.  What emerges is a candidate who had gained the confidence of moderate Democrats who saw him as Presidential Timber.<br /><br />The only incident of significance during Truman's short Vice-Presidency showed something about his character.  Attendance at the funeral of convicted felon Tom Pendergast demonstrated his strong loyalty to friends.<br /><br />I had known of some of the momentous events of Truman's presidency, but thisbook shows the nonstop sequence of crises which was thrust upon him.  The confrontations at Potsdam, the worry about the development and use of the atomic bomb, the terms of settlement with Japan and the founding of the United Nations were just the beginning.  Pent-up industrial unrest unleashed a wave of strikes which confronted the President with labor challenges unparalleled in American history.  Soviet pressures in Europe, Jewish-Arab rivalries in Palestine and British financial collapse presented international challenges.  The imminent threats which lead to aid to Greece and Turkey and the Marshall Plan are presented better than I have ever seen.  The agonies over the Berlin Blockade and Airlift are skillfully told.<br /><br />The many angles of the 1948 election, in which Truman survived challenges to his nomination, defections to the left and right and a strong Republican challenge are deftly woven into a story which you will not want to put down.<br /><br />The 1948 victory was truly a summit from which Truman descended for the rest of his life.  The second term during which the White House was restored,  NATO established, China \\"lost\\" and Korea invaded was an era of frustration for a president whose hopes of establishing a \\"Fair Deal\\" degenerated into a struggle for survival.

Comparable emphasis is given to Maris the baseball player, Maris the family man, Maris the son of Fargo and Maris the faithful Catholic.<br /><br />Roger Maris grew up an Fargo, North Dakota where he attended Catholic schools and met his wife, Pat, while developing into a great baseball star.  After the minor leagues, Roger continued his march to stardom as a Cleveland Indian and a Kansas City Athletic.  Even in Cleveland he was regarded as a surly loner.<br /><br />After his playing time in his adopted home of Kansas City, Roger was ready for the Yankee pinstripes but not for the glare of the New York press.  Although he changed teams, Roger retained a privacy which would forever bar the press from his world and would limit his enjoyment of public adulation.  The press would demonize Roger in his pursuit of Babe Ruth's record, while manufacturing the legend of a feud between himself and his roommate, Mickey Mantle.<br /><br />Throughout the ups and downs of his stormy and injury plagued career, Roger retained his love of baseball which was damped only during the most severe of the onslaughts by fans and media.<br /><br />This book wears its themes on its sleeve.  The main themes are that Roger was not properly appreciated, his purported surliness was merely a justified demand for privacy and that he has been unjustly denied admission into the Hall Of Fame.<br /><br />Although written by an obvious fan, this book does not do justice to Roger Maris.  Too often the story degenerates into a litany of quotes from Roger, his teammates, friends and detractors to be classified as good writing.  The sections dealing with the media bias and the injustice of his exclusion from the Hall Of Fame run on too long.  This book is more editorial than biography.  Still, this book tells much about Roger Maris. It also tells us much about ourselves, the fans.  Yankee fans booed the Roger Maris whom they regarded a surly usurper.  By contrast, Cardinal fans loved Jolly Roger.  This is in keeping with our reputation as the greatest fans in baseball.  The story of how the Cardinals restored Roger's enjoyment of the game and delayed his retirement for two years confirm the stories I remember from the time.  It is too bad that Roger did not become a Cardinal in 1960.  He could have been as big as Mark McGwire.run on too long.  This book is more editorial than biography.

This book does provide the reader with an insight into Truman's thoughts and words.  This book provides few memorable quotations to elevate your speech.  I do not fault the book.  Truman was common, not very quotable.  It is often said that Republicans like to quote Democrats.  After reading this book one will understand why Truman is rarely quoted.  He was truly a common man in word and action.  This is not one of the better quotation books which I have found.	2005-03-11

From his home in Baltimore through the minor leagues, the major leagues and retirement we see the man behind the hero.  Wagenhem does an excellent job of interweaving baseball with life.<br /><br />Through the pages we meet the dichotomy that is Babe Ruth.  Though America's greatest sports hero, he never learned to take care of himself.  Though he could afford any car he wanted, he needed them because he never really learned to drive safely.  Despite achieving riches unimaginable for an athlete of his day, he never quite crossed to the right side of the tracks.  Despite a life dripping with debauchery, he never left the Church in which he had been raised.  A vocal supporter of Al Smith, he did not register to vote until long after the Smith era.  After having established himself as an outstanding pitcher, he became the game's greatest hitter.<br /><br />The baseball world of Ruth's day is portrayed as differing greatly from that of today.  In the off season players doubled their earnings on barnstorming tours.  Players rode trains rather than planes.  Some abused booze rather than drugs, but Oh, they played the game and the Babe dominated it as no other player has before or since.<br /><br />Babe's life was a combination of triumph and tragedy, fulfillment and despair.  The road from the top was bumpy for he Babe.  His dream to manage never fulfilled, Babe resented a world which, though it was his life, he never really understood.<br /><br />This book changed my view of Babe Ruth.  He emerges as a figure despiseable and lovable, heroic and  irresponsible, admired and pitied.  The ability to lead the reader to see a different viewpoint is a test of a good book.  By this measurement \\"Babe Ruth\\" hits a homer.	2005-02-20

Although it contains much biographical material, it is not a true biography.  It does tell much about the stage on which William McKinley played.<br /><br />McKinley rose to national prominence by becoming an expert on the tariff.  In congress he was known as the technical master of customs duties.  How he used this expertise to propel himself to the post of Governor of Ohio is a puzzlement, but it does reflect the immense importance of tariff policy in an era when elections were fought over protection and when most federal revenue was derived from the tariff.<br /><br />Much of the book tells the story of aspects of public life in which McKinley participated.  A major portion of the book deals with the Spanish American War.  Here one sees McKinley among those presidents whose administrations were transformed by events from a domestic focus into one dominated by martial exploits.  I have studied much about the Spanish American War (see my Listmania, \\"Remember The Maine, To Hell With Spain\\" and my Amazon Reviews, A Ship To Remember, Colonel Roosevelt, The Rough Riders, An Army For Empire and Little Brown Brothers) but this book provides a unique perspective on the war.  Here the focus is on the role of the president in the decision to go to war and its subsequent prosecution.  On these pages we see the veteran who had learned to hate war being drawn into a war despite all of his efforts to avoid it.  In some parts the narration of the war almost makes the reader forget that McKinley was involved.  Even so, it places some aspects of the war, such as the exploits of the Rough Riders, into a perspective of the greater conflict which is lacking in some works.  With war a reality, the president became actively involved in the need to equip the army, decide on the targets of attack and the peace negotiations.  All of these aspects receive ample attention from the author.<br /><br />With the conclusion of the war, the controversy over the disposition of the captured islands became a  focus of public debate and a major issue in the 1900 election.  William Jennings Bryan's \\"mixed messages\\" to use a recent term, are contrasted to McKinley's consistency.  The decision to \\"Take whatever we can and to keep whatever we want\\" would have profound implications for the U. S. and the world.  McKinley's self image as God's chosen instrument would be echoed in some of his successors.<br /><br />In an era when vice-presidents were rarely heard, McKinley's first Veep. Garrett Hobart, was a close friend who played a surprisingly important role in the administration, leading its programs through the Senate and carrying out special assignments.  With Hobarts' death the selection of a second term running mate became a major event in McKinley's career and, with the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt, in the life of the nation.<br /><br />Through the chapters of this book, author Margaret Leech gives the reader an excellent study of themes in the history of McKinley's days.  In so doing she does not neglect McKinley himself.  She shows how he was and remained a product of Nineteenth Century Ohio where he was born and lived his life.  She tells of McKinley's service in the Union Army, during which he reached the rank of Major before returning to Ohio to undertake legal studies.  Settling in Canton, he rose steadily in his career and in public esteem.<br /><br />Leech tells the tender love story of McKinley and his wife, Ida, whose neurological disorder would be a constant concern throughout their married life.  He learned to cope with her frequent seizures without interrupting the routine of the day, while always placing Ida first in his heart.  It is amazing that he accomplished what he did with the limitations imposed by Ida's infirmity.  He comes across as a highly successful man who kept his priorities in order.<br /><br />This book has been described as a first rate book about a second rate president.  While you read it you will understand why it made Margaret Leech the first woman to win two Pulitzer prizes.  From it I acquired a respect for McKinley as a president who successfully confronted a variety of complex issues.  I think that he successfully advanced the interests of his country and followed practices which serve as good models for others.  Read it and formulate your own rating of McKinley.sident.

More than a list of records and triumphs of the baseball star, we meet the human being behind the records.  I always had the impression that Gehrig was a good man, whereas Babe Ruth was only a good baseball player.  This book confirms that impression.<br /><br />Growing up the son of German immigrants, Gehrig had the disadvantage of being something of an outsider in his own world.  Baseball was just one avenue he traveled in his efforts to advance himself.  Various jobs and Columbia University were other options pursued by Lou.  His parents discouraged him from playing a game which they did not understand.  When Lou had to choose between Columbia University and baseball, his parents urged the University, while a professor recommended baseball.  Going to work every day was not extraordinary for Lou.  That was how his parents raised him.<br /><br />In his chosen trade, Lou achieved excellence and attention wherever he played.  Lou lived the thrill of playing baseball, and as a Yankee to boot!  Lou always considered himself the luckiest man alive, even as he lived in the shadow of two giants, Babe Ruth at the start of his career, and Joe DiMaggio toward the end.  Through it all, Lou considered himself a lucky man.<br /><br />Robinson leads the reader through a character study of his boyhood hero.  We see Lou's relationships with his loving parents who could never understand the stage on which he strode.  His wife, who gave him joy while suffering his mother's resentment, would be his solace in his illness.  His relationships with his team mates, particularly Babe Ruth, get much attention.  In this book we see Gehrig as a man not only driven by passions and wants, but guided by a sense of right and wrong.  He was the moral compass of the Yankees.  This trait prevented him from ever being the close friend of Ruth with whom he is so commonly associated in the public mind.<br /><br />Driven, perhaps, by contemporary interests, Lou's earnings are frequently reported.  We are brought to understand that even a star of Gehrig's luminance earned a large salary, but still needed to work when he retired.  Lou found post baseball employment in a department of the city in which he grew up, achieved stardom and gradually deteriorated and died.<br /><br />The illness of the only patient to give his name to a disease forms much of the latter sections of the book.  Robinson tries to give an accurate report of how the disease affected Lou without over exaggerating its effects.  We travel with Lou throughout his slump, ending of the streak and his gradual deterioration.  At the end we have seen all 37 years of his remarkable and admirable life.<br /><br />Although the reader is introduced to the persona of Lou Gehrig, there is plenty of baseball too.  This is an excellent book for any baseball fan with a desire to into the soul of one of baseball's most noble knights./> <br />Driven, perhaps, by contemporary interests, Lou's earnings are frequently reported.

In \\"Harry S Truman\\", Robert Ferrell gives the reader an introduction to this ordinary Missourian who lived such an extraordinary life.  The reader is treated to an overview of this extraordinary life from childhood through the farm, the army, courtship and marriage, fatherhood, politics and retirement.  Ferrell has managed to keep the book moving apace while providing sufficient detail to satisfy the readers curiosity.<br /><br />An obvious fan of Truman, Ferrell does not hide his hero's faults or short falls while discussing his accomplishments.  Truman's days as County Judge and his relationship with Boss Pendergast show a man who maintained his principles while taking advantage of a few opportunities, both political and financial, which may have been a bit on the shady side.  I would think that a story centered in Jackson County politics could get boring really fast, but in this book even that stays interesting.  He depicts of the marriage of Bess and Harry as a true love match which overcame interference from Bess' mother and periods of separation when Harry was in Washington.  His election to and service in the Senate make for an interesting prelude to the Presidency.<br /><br />The White House years, naturally, get the heaviest attention.  Truman's relationships with and opinions of FDR, George Marshall, Dean Atcheson,  Eisenhower and MacArthur, Churchill, Nixon and others too many to mention give the book a greater breadth than is found in many biographies.  The leading issues of those years, including the Atomic bomb, the end of World War II, relations with the Soviet Union, labor unrest, the economy, the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War and Sen. McCarthy are all shown from the White House perspective.  The reader is given an insight into Truman's loves, likes, beliefs and hatreds.  The narration of the 1948 election, both the nomination and election segments, are fascinating reading. Truman was left with plenty of scores to even, baggage which could have impaired his performance, had he allowed it.<br /><br />Questions I have long entertained include \\"Why Truman?\\", \\"Was he better than people said?\\" and \\"How Well Did He Perform?\\"  This book provided some answers but some questions remain unanswered.  Why out of 300 Democratic governors and members of Congress did the Democratic Party select Truman for vice-president to an obviously dying FDR? That one remains a mystery.  I now believe that he did a very good job for someone with his limitations, but that he was limited by his time and world view.  Maybe as he said, there were a million Americans who were better qualified to be president than he was, but he had the job and did the best he could.

With a copyright granted in 1960, the title may be dated, but the narrative is thorough.<br /><br />This book is concentrated on the Philippine theatre of the Spanish American War.  Leon Wolf begins with backgrounds of the Imperialist sentiment in the U. S. and the Philippine struggle for independence.  The nature of the Spanish domination of the islands, largely through control of government and church offices, is laid out.<br /><br />Action in the Far East began with Adm. Dewey's destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898.  This left a multi-polar balance of power, with American dominance of the Bay, challenged by German and British fleets and the city under the control of the Spanish, but surrounded to landward by the Filipino insurgents.  This state led to a series of discussions during which the Spanish negotiated with the Americans for an arrangement which would satisfy their pride while protecting them from massacre by the Filipinos.  The Filipinos, meanwhile, were negotiating with the Americans for support for their revolution.  These negotiations would lead to conflicting claims as to what was promised which would be adjusted by the American Army.  With the build-up of the American Army the balance of power shifted and the American conquest began.  Extending over several years, the Americans occupied first the Bay, next Manila and, after a drive across Luzon, the entire archipelago.<br /><br />Much attention is devoted to the political struggles over whether the U. S. should take the islands and, if so, how much they should take.  Other nations stirred in the troubled pot.  Japan's offer to help govern the islands was spurned.  German bellicose behavior was opposed by the Royal Navy.<br /><br />American debate over taking the islands was reminiscent of more recent debates over foreign interventions.  Many of the issues are similar to ones which have arisen at other times in history and which continue to arise.  As the war with the Filipino insurgents dragged on, the Americans were accused of conduct which was similar to Spanish actions which led to American intervention in Cuba.  Imperialists and Anti-imperialists argued over whether or not American treasure should be expended and blood spilled in tropical jungles and whether we were liberating or murdering their inhabitants.  The concentration of natives in villages was not only reminiscent of Spanish measures but prescient of American actions decades later in another Asian battleground. American actions in the islands became a political football, while Filipino patriots attacked American troops while awaiting the election of William Jennings Bryan in anticipation of receiving a grant of independence from his hands.  With the reelection of William McKinley, Filipino independence was deferred for over 40 years.<br /><br />Throughout this book I enjoyed reading the history and comparing its issues with those of later eras.  The conquest of the Philippines really set the pattern for American victories and defeats throughout the rest of the 20th Century.  These comparisons provide fuel for hours of contemplation.<br /><br />Throughout this work the author maintains a good balance between detail and broad themes, without ever becoming bogged down or detached from reality.  It is informative and readable.  As you can see from my other reviews, a really good book earns four stars from me.  Only the exceptional ones, such as \\"Little Brown Brother\\", earn five.are similar to ones which have arisen at other times in history and which continue to arise.

Although most people's understanding of the Wars of the Roses is gleaned from Shakespeare, Gillingham points out the truth is often less dramatic.  Despite their reputation for causing major upheavals tin English society, the wars  are shown as being relatively limited struggles involving comparatively small numbers of troops.  Gillingham points out that the touted extinction of noble houses during the wars occurred at a rate comparable to peaceful eras of the same centuries.  He also explains how the prevailing architecture shows England to have been a more peaceful land than its continental contemporaries.  As the struggle was over personal rights to the throne, it ended with little residual division and bitterness as often result from civil wars based on economic or ideological rivalries.<br /><br />Through much of the book kings, dukes and lesser nobility race by at dizzying speeds, making the personae dramatae difficult to follow.<br /><br />I suspect that this book would be more edifying to one better versed in English medieval history than me.  Even with my limitations, I emerged from the reading of this book with a better understanding of the England of that age.  For this, if for no other reason, it is a worthwhile read.	2004-12-03

In \\"Colonel Roosevelt\\" H. Paul Jeffers continues the magnificent story of Theodore Roosevelt which he began in \\"Commissioner Roosevelt.\\"  On its pages he tells the story of TR's involvement in the Spanish American War.<br /><br />The story begins with TR's successful campaign to obtain the appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Navy.  Despite President McKinley's prescience that \\"Theodore is too pugnacious\\" the appointment was made and Theodore began his crusade for war.  For one year TR maneuvered for hostilities with Spain and prepared the Navy for the War which he was creating.  Serving notice of his world view in a speech to the Naval War college in 1897, TR ruffled feathers while securing his place as a prominent \\"jingo\\", those working for war.  During his year in the Navy department, Roosevelt was busy requesting appropriations for ship building, chartering vessels and ordering ammunition and coal, all the while presiding over training of the crews.  Having secured the position of Commander of the Asiatic Squadron for his friend, George Dewey, TR took advantage of a day that Secretary Long took off to send the momentous telegram to Dewey ordering him to be ready to seize the Philippines in the event of war with Spain.  Despite his horror, Long let the order stand, profoundly changing the history of the 20th century<br /><br />Leaving TR in the Navy department, Jeffers does a nice, although brief, job of explaining the causes of and agitators for the war.  The primary causus belli was the Spanish suppression of the revolt in Cuba.  While William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer beat the war drums while President McKinley worked for a peaceful solution.  After the sinking of the Maine McKinley lost control of events and was eventually forced to ask for war.  When he did, Roosevelt was ready.<br /><br />Having done what he could for the Navy, TR left to have his share of the fun in the Army.  Wisely he accepted a Lt. Colonelcy under Col. Leonard Wood in the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, soon to be known as Roosevelt's Rough Riders.  Roosevelt realized that his limited military experience may have delayed the unit's training until the war was over.  The Rough Riders were unusual in that most volunteer units were organized by state, not nationally.  Although created to admit volunteers from the Southwest, it also attracted many Easterners, including many Ivy League athletes.<br /><br />Organized in San Antonio, the Rough Riders moved to Tampa for embarkation.  Orders kept a portion of the unit in the States, but not Roosevelt.  Although  lamenting the loss of Rain In The Face, his horse which drowned while disembarking in Cuba, TR approached the landing in Daiquiri with enthusiasm.  Organizing his troops, TR got his first taste of combat on June 30, 1898 on the road from Siboney to Las Guasimas.  Leading the troops against the Spaniards in the gloom, TR inspired his men as he lead them on to victory.  His \\"Crowded Hour\\" followed on July 1 when he lead his men up Kettle Hill in the assault on the heights overlooking Santiago.<br /><br />Having achieved the domineering position over looking Santiago, the destruction of the Spanish fleet by the Navy which TR had prepared, substituted disease for the Spanish as the main threat the Army had to face.  During this phase of the campaign, TR, as one without a military career to place in jeopardy, took the lead in demanding the evacuation of the troops from Cuba.  Stateside panic that the Army would introduce Yellow Fever, whereas it suffered from malaria, presented a temporary impediment to repatriation.  This being overcome, TR accompanied his men to Montauk, Long Island for quarantine and discharge.  From there he went on to the governorship of New York and, eventually, the White House.  Jeffers also introduces the reader into the subsequent careers of other members of the Rough Riders.<br /><br />Although somewhat superficial due to its length, \\"Colonel Roosevelt\\" does give the reader a good introduction to TR and the Rough Riders in particular and the Spanish American War in general.oosevelt\\" does give the reader a good introduction to TR and the Rough Riders in particular and the Spanish American War in general.	2004-11-27

The Yankees and the Cardinals seemed on the way to a World Series rematch and newspaper accounts of the 40th anniversary of the 1964 Series made a return to the days of yesteryear seem attractive.  The Yankees missed the rematch but \\"October 1964\\" did not disappoint.  This review is in the nature of a favor passed on.<br /><br />This book can best be described as character studies of two baseball organizations.  The `64 Yankees are portrayed as the last gasp of a dying dynasty, a dinosaur that had not adapted the changing baseball world.  As black players deepened the talent pool, the Yankees catered to their middle class fan pass.  As the Yankee pinstripes began to mean less than signing bonuses, the output of their once rich farm system became as parsimonious as their management.  Patching together aging bodies and strained muscles, the Yankees managed to come from behind to win the pennant, but Whitey Ford's sore arm, Mickey Mantle's aching legs and Tony Kubek's back sapped the energy from the Yankee spirit.<br /><br />The Cardinals, by contrast, were a collection of veterans and rising stars trying to find the winning combination, while management worked at cross purposes.  Spurred by announcer Harry Carey, the impatient Gussie Busch, who knew even less about baseball than he did about failure, began the dismantling of a management on the threshold of victory.  Branch Rickey, a fossilized fifth wheel, crowded out general manager Bing Devine shortly after the completion of perhaps the greatest trade in baseball history, that of Ernie Broglio for Lou Brock.<br /><br />On the field, the collection of southern whites and rising blacks felt their way with trepidation under the gentle guidance of Johnny Keane.  As a young fan, I reveled in Cardinal success.  As a reader, I learned about my heroes.  I knew Ken Boyer as the team leader whose signature graced my glove, but I had forgotten the derision heaped upon him by Harry Carey and the fans.  I knew Dick Groat as a steady veteran in the All Star infield.  I read that he was a disruption in the club house.<br /><br />I had forgotten how new Mike Shannon was in 1964.  I always liked the way the stadium announcer intoned \\"Curt Simmons\\" and the story of how he had pitched so well for the Phillies in 1950 before his induction into the army took him out of the World Series.  His 1964 World Series appearance had seemed to be long overdue.  This book reminded me about his steady performance which helped get the Cardinals into the Series.  I had known Tim McCarver as the enthusiastic catcher.  David Halberstam introduced me to the son of a Memphis policeman whose friendship with Bob Gibson was part of the glue which put this winner together.<br /><br />Bob Gibson was incomparable on the mound, although Halberstam reminds the reader that the Gibson of 1964 was not the dominating machine of later in the decade.  Bill White was the power hitting first baseman and Curt Flood the fast defensive star in center field.  I remember how Lou Brock caught fire and sparked a moribund team.  I had always regarded them as just other stars.  I had no idea of all that these black men had gone through in the southern minor leagues and their own uncertainties as to their places in the game.<br /><br />Although the story of the World Series comprises only about 10% of the book it, along with the stories of the pennant races clarify the memories which had grown hazy with time.<br /><br />The epilogue is a combination of triumph and tragedy which reminds us that baseball is only a game from which even its gods must move on into a real world which is not always so kind.  Yogi Berra would be fired and replaced by Johnny Keane, whose tenure in New York would be unsuccessful.  Yogi would manage the Mets before returning to the Yankees.  Ken Boyer would be traded and wind down his career with other teams before returning to manage the Cardinals.  Roger Maris would escape New York to find happiness as a Cardinal before he and Boyer succumbed to cancer in their early 50s.  Mickey Mantle's career and health would decline as a life of abuse took its toll.  Curt Flood's career would end with his legal challenge to the reserve clause.<br /><br />Tim McCarver and Mike Shannon would find places in the broadcast booths.  Bobbie Richardson found a home as a college baseball coach while Dal Maxville became general manager of the Cardinals.  Bob Gibson would variously coach pitching in the majors and operate a restaurant.  Bill White would rise to president of the National League.  When his legs gave out, Lou Brock would continue as a public figure in St. Louis.  Jim Bouton and Bob Uecker would achieve fame by poking fun at the game they lived for.<br /><br />Early in the story, Halberstam refers to the unsettled social environment of the 60s.

Howarth does an excellent job in laying the background and explaining how the change of dynasties was effected.  The background is seen in terms of an English village, the governmental structure of England and the basis for each claim to the throne.  Character studies of both Kings Harold and William enable us to feel as if we know each of them.  The explanation of the structure, strengths and weaknesses of each army prepare the reader to follow the excellent narrations of the battles at which the issues were decided.  The consequences of this momentous year to all involved, Harold, who was killed, William, who gained the crown of a land he learned to detest, the English nobility, the Normans who supplanted them and the common people of England, whose lives were disrupted forever, blend multiple threads of the book to a unified conclusion.<br /><br />I often have difficulty in following a book about a portion of history about which I know little.  Although I knew little of the environment or events of \\"1016\\", I had no such difficulties in this case.  Howarth presents \\"1066\\" as a such a self contained unit as to make it totally understandable on it's own.  This is the mark of a masterful story teller.	2004-10-19

It clearly shows its age.<br /><br />This book focuses, though not exclusively, on the role of Quebec as a fortress.  The authors do a decent job of telling its illustrious story, but I have read better.<br /><br />The chapters are organized thematically and, for the most part, chronologically.  The initial chapters relate the stories of the early explorations an the era of Champlain, the founder of Quebec.  This section was of particular interest to me because Champlain greeted some of my ancestors upon their arrival in Canada.  The Seventeenth Century was the age of expansion and the era of the Jesuit North American martyrs.  The governorship of Frontenac, who tried to create a New World Versailles at Quebec, and the inland explorations of Joliet and LaSalle were, perhaps, the high water marks of New France.<br /><br />As the Eighteenth Century progressed, wars gradually chipped at French hegemony over much of North America.  The importance of control of Halifax and Louisbourg to the security of Quebec is well explained.  We read of the climatic showdown of Wolfe and Montcalm at Quebec.  After the conquest, political control passed to Britain and the names of the governors and generals changed from French to English.<br /><br />The authors get a good start at explaining the differences between the settlement patterns of the French and English.  The French, motivated largely by religion, saw the New World as presenting an opportunity for Catholicism to compensate for the ground lost to Protestantism in Europe.  The New England colonies were intensively settled and became largely self-sufficient, relying of Europe for luxuries and conveniences.  New France was extensively, but sparsely settled, and remained dependent on Europe for the staples and necessities of life.  Despite this good start, the authors failed to seize the opportunity to explain that the economy of New France was based on the fur trade which precluded the intensive settlement which could have enabled New France to compete long term against the Lion of Britain.  By the end the book transfers into a paean of the loyalty of French Canadians to the Dominion.<br /><br />I mentioned that this book shows its age.  I say this because of its writing style.  The adjectives sound almost like something from a Mississippi River showboat.  Phrases such as \\"disgraceful orgies\\", \\"hellish merriment\\" and \\"the fiends\\" provide an indication of the style throughout  this book.  This is not consistent with what we see in a modern history.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book although I must admit a bit of disappointment.

In his view the Jews, unlike antecedent societies, viewed history as progressive, not cyclical.  The Jews recognized the worth of each individual rather than seeing people only as members of a group.  The Jews see human action as making a difference, rather than being the results of unalterable fate.  The Jews see God as a person who talks with His people and who invites them to have a personal relationship with Him.<br /><br />Cahill makes his case by telling the history of the Jews as told in the Old Testament, from the call of Abraham to the return form the Babylonian Captivity.  Through his selection of Biblical stories he demonstrates the evolution of the Jewish world view over the millennia.<br /><br />This book's depiction of the evolution of the Jewish understanding of God and man's relationship to Him makes for a very interesting read.  It is generally consistent with what I had learned in collegiate scripture classes.<br /><br />From the perspective of an analysis of development of Jewish thought as reflected in the Bible, it is very good.  My only question is whether the insights identified as being Jewish are truly unique.  Cahill says yes, but I lack the knowledge to form an independent judgment.  Overall, it is a fascinating book concluding with challenging questions for all readers.	2004-10-05

Much of this book deals with the history of the organization and supply of the U. S. Army during the Spanish American War.  Relatively few pages are devoted to narration of the actual combat.<br /><br />Much of the story of the preparation of the Army dealt with the sometimes stormy relationships between President McKinley, Secretary of War Alger, Commanding General Of The Army Miles, Adjutant General Corbin, General Shafter, Commander in Cuba, and more minor characters.  Cosmas points out the challenges confronting the administration which contributed to the disorganization and poor food for which it was criticized.  Legal restrictions on the deployment of National Guard units complicated the recruitment of volunteer troops.  Problems arose out of the incompatibility of equipment among the state militias.  Political tugs of war between regular and state forces complicated staffing.  Limited ordnance production capabilities constrained material accumulation.  Shifting war aims introduced inefficiencies into the deployment of troops.  The post hostility problems with tropical diseases and their stateside ramifications receive in depth analysis.  All in all, Cosmas concludes that the War Department succeeded, by war's end, in developing a suitable Army for Empire.<br /><br />Cosmas does a good job in explaining how the shifting war aims drove changes in invasion plans.  Whereas original debate centered over attacks on Havana or Puerto Rico, the discovery of Adm. Cervera's fleet in Santiago Harbor compelled a landing near Santiago.  The reader learns that the seemingly irrational departure of the Spanish fleet from Santiago was done under orders.  The resulting destruction of the Spanish fleet cut the army off from its sources of supply and condemned it to either starvation or surrender.<br /><br />Cosmas show how inefficiencies turned up in unexpected places.  Despite the longer trip, the expedition to the Philippines was better organized than the one to Cuba.  As things turned out, the Army raised about twice as many volunteer troops as it used.<br /><br />Having read other books about the Spanish American War, \\"An Army For Empire\\" supplemented what I already knew.  It tied things together and showed the \\"whys\\" behind the \\"whats\\".  For this it was worthwhile.  I thought that the extensive verbage about supply and organization may prove boring, but it never did.  I would not recommend this as a first book about the Spanish American war.

Faherty's second book on Rev. John B. Bannon, tells the story of Bannon's the multi-careered life.  Drawn largely from Fr. Bannon's diaries and the writings of those whose lives he touched, it records a fascinating sequence of details about a life which would challenge the imagination of a writer of fiction.<br /><br />Bannon was born in 1829 in Ireland where he was educated and ordained to the Catholic priesthood.  Upon hearing the plea for priests in America, Bannon offered his services to Archbishop Peter R. Kenrick of St. Louis.  In St. Louis Bannon rose rapidly, being appointed pastor of the largely Irish St. John's parish in 1858 where he supervised the construction of the Church which still serves downtown St. Louis.  When war broke out in 1861, Bannon followed many of his parishioners South to serve as chaplain of the First Missouri Confederate Brigade.  After serving at Pea Ridge, Vicksburg and other battles, Bannon was eventually asked by President Jefferson Davis to undertake a mission to Ireland.  Many Irish had been enlisting in the Union Army.  Bannon proceeded to Ireland where his efforts enjoyed considerable success in stemming the flow of recruits to the North.  While in Europe he personally implored Pope Pius IX to recognize the Confederacy, a plea which did result in a letter addressed to \\"Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America\\" which was advanced as defacto recognition.  Prevented from returning to Missouri by acts of the legislature and the presumed hostility of Archbishop Kenrick, Bannon remained in Ireland where he joined the Society of Jesus and became one of the most renowned preachers in the Isle.  Fr. Bannon's status as the only pastor to sacrifice a big city parish in order to minister to his soldiers and his bravery under fire command our admiration.  A painting of the Battle of Pea Ridge now hanging in the White House of the Confederacy prominently featuring Fr. Bannon ministering to the wounded honors his memory.<br /><br />Drawing on writings by Bannon and his companions,  \\"Exile In Erin\\" not only gives the reader the story of this magnificent life but also snippets of the world in which he lived.  We are treated to eyewitness descriptions of the battles of Pea Ridge and Corinth and the siege of Vicksburg.  We are admitted into his relationships with his men and their officers.  The reader is present while Bannon carries the struggle across the seas to Ireland and senses his successes.  One can only wonder what might have happened had he gotten to Europe before Irish has swelled the Union ranks and battlefield defeats had made recognition unattainable.<br /><br />The story of Bannon's career in Ireland after the war tells of his efforts to build up the Church in his native land.  The descriptions of localities, including one from which my ancestors came, bring a sense of connection to the book.  The need to build the Church in Ireland after centuries of British oppression shocks Irish Americans who may assume that the Faith was always alive and vibrant on the Auld Sod.<br /><br />I have read and reviewed other biographies of Fr. Bannon.  This one is more extensive in its breadth and detailed in its narration than others.  Whether your interests include the Civil War, St. Louis history, Irish history or just an unbelievable story eloquently told, \\"Exile In Erin\\" is a book for you.nded honors his memory.<br /><br />Drawing on writings by Bannon and his companions,  \\"Exile In Erin\\" not only gives the reader the story of this magnificent life but also snippets of the world in which he lived.

US	48581126	R2SZ8LAA3FRCXL	0786115661	331533627	Nixon in Winter	Books	5	8	10	N	N	See Nixon Up Close.	In \\"Nixon In Winter\\", Monica Crowley admits the reader into a day-to-day working relationship with of one the premier lives of the Twentieth Century over its last four years.  This is interesting, both in terms of the character study of Nixon and the issues with which he dealt.<br /><br />The book consists mostly of monologues or dialogues, dominated by Nixon, and Crowley's observation of actions.  The author was a graduate student who worked as Nixon's foreign policy adviser from 1990-4.  During this time she assisted him in writing his books, traveled with him and listened and elicited his views on the topics of the day.<br /><br />This book opened my mind to several new concepts about Nixon.  I had known that Nixon had written several books after leaving office.  I had not realized the intensity with which he pursued his role as a continuing force in international politics.  He devoted the best of his energies to this work.  The planning for his trips to Russia and China included arrangements to meet the leading figures, those from whom he could learn and on whom he could exert influence.  He viewed himself as the only world figure who could bridge the chasms between the U. S. and these foreign powers, chasms often caused by contemporary policies with which he was unassociated.  To the end of his life, Nixon strove to mold world affairs to his vision.  Frustrated by his inability to directly influence affairs, he had to work through his successors for whom he had varying degrees of respect.  He alternatively predicted, assessed and railed against the coverage of his trips by the media.  He seemed motivated both to redeem himself as well as to make a difference in the world.<br /><br />Nixon continued to resent what he saw as a double standard, a practice under which he was found culpable for actions which were accepted or overlooked in other presidents.  He never really accepted that his actions in connection with Watergate in any way justified the censure which he suffered.<br /><br />Revealing also are the insights into the private Nixon.  The Nixon who served food, sometimes with help, the Nixon who attributed the attention of Chinese crowds to the presence of Americans, rather than the presence of President Nixon and who wondered why strollers on the sidewalks of New York would look at traffic when he went to the city.  The way he dealt with Pat's illness and confronted his own impending dissolution provide a window into his soul.  The Dick who would greet Trick Or Treaters on Halloween is a man to whom I can relate.<br /><br />I have heard it said that Nixon was a near genius, and Crowley's reports of they philosophies which he read and understood support that assessment.<br /><br />Nixon comes across as a very interesting man, but one with whom I think it would be difficult to interact.  Crowley seems to have enjoyed a good relationship, primarily by listening and doing the chores requested.  He does not seem to be one with whom a visitor could have had a real exchange of ideas.  He seems to be one to whom each contact was an opportunity to persuade with his \\"talking points.\\"  He seems to have learned by his own observations and readings, not by exchanging ideas with others.  He seems to have been one who was interested in influencing the powerful, but who had no time for common Americans.  I may be wrong, but I could envision engaging Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush in a fairly normal conversation, should I run into them in an airport or Sam's Club.  I cannot envision any such discussion with Nixon.<br /><br />All things considered, I rate this as a very engaging book.  I judge a book, in part, by whether it whets my appetite for more.  This really did that.  I look forward to reading Nixon's books again, now with a better understanding of their purposes.  I want to read more about his life and magnificent career.  This proves that \\"Nixon In Winter\\" made an impression on me.  This is a book for anyone with an interest in Nixon and who wants to understand him better.e with an interest in Nixon and who wants to understand him better.	2004-09-15

Although mostly focusing on the English, it does give some introduction to the French forces.  When I read that many of the French troops were from Normandy I wondered how many of my ancestors were fighting on that field.<br /><br />I found this book to give an informative insight into the dynastic quarrels of the 15th century, the challenges of military recruitment, the methods and weapons of combat and the characters involved in this battle.  The comparison and contrast between history and Shakespeare's Henry V is interesting.  Hibbert's assessment of Henry's character adds depth to the book.<br /><br />This book is not a comprehensive history of the era by any means, but id does provide a map shot into one moment of it.  All in all this merits a high recommendation as an introduction to this historic battle and a mild introduction for the reader with broader interests in the Middle Ages.	2004-09-11

When I began reading \\"Pontiffs: Popes Who Shaped History\\" I was expecting a book which would be interesting and informative.  It did not take me long to realize that I had seriously underestimated it.  This book is outstanding!  This book introduced me to Popes about whom I knew little or nothing and told me a lot about others with whom I had some familiarity.  What I appreciate most about this book is its ability to place facts, of which I had previously heard, in their context or in a light of which I had never thought.<br /><br />Fr. Hughes features eleven Popes from St. Peter to Pope John XXIII.  Not all of these seem to be among Fr. Hughes' favorites, nor did they always affect history in a positive manner, but each did leave their marks on the course of history.  St. Peter preserved the Church in the early years after the Resurrection.  St. Leo The Great (440-61) defended the Church and Rome from the onslaught of the Barbarians while guiding it through the collapse of the Empire in the West.  St. Gregory The Great (590-604) sponsored missionary outreach and left a canon which helped define orthodoxy.  Gregory VII (1073-85) tested his strength against that of Medieval Monarchs, before Innocent III (1198-1216) defended the Church from heresy, preached Crusades and approved the rise of the great Mendicant orders of the Church.  Boniface VIII (1294-1303) also sparred with monarchs and revised canon law.  The response of Leo X (1513-21) to the challenges of Martin Luther and others contributed to the split of Christendom.  Pius V (1566-72) inspired the defense of Christendom form the Turks, while his response to Protestantism, particularly in the person of Elizabeth I of England, weakened Christian solidarity.  Pius VII lead the Church through the Napoleonic era and related upheavals, giving the Church advances and setbacks, while altering the balance between national Churches and the Papacy.  Leo XIII (1878-1903) turned the Church to face the \\"Social Question\\" while failing to understand the changing political forces of his day.  John XIII intervened in great power crises and called Vatican II, which lead to so many reforms within the Church.<br /><br />If this book seems to lack a consistent theme, it is because history is inconsistent.  Fr. Hughes does not choose a theme and then fit the characters into it.  He tells the story of each of these historically significant Pontiffs.  They were different men facing different challenges.  They met success and failure in varying proportions.  They sometimes advanced the Church and civilization, and at other times inflicted grievous and long standing wounds.  They represent no consistent path of advancement.<br /><br />I learned the context of things that already knew.  One professor had told me that, at the time of the Great Schism, Popes were called \\"Vicars of Peter\\" and suggested that readoption of that title might be a step toward reunification of the two great branches of Catholicism.  Fr. Hughes explains the importance of the identification of the Popes with St. Peter and the adoption of the term \\"Vicar of Christ\\" by Innocent III.  I had always heard of the Jesuits' oath of loyalty to the Pope, but this book presented it as arising in a time during which many clergy identified more with their monarchs than with the Papacy.  The precedent of Popes being kidnapped and transported over Europe, including Pius VII by Napoleon, places Pius XII's situation during World War II in an entirely different light than what we would think of today.  There is also just plain trivia, such as the Dominican habit of Pius V becoming the precedent for the white papal habit of modern times.<br /><br />All of these insights are expressed in very direct, clear prose.  This book contains none of the difficult, boring writing style often found in scholarly works.  This book is written in a style readily understandable by a wide spectrum of the reading public.  For anyone with an interest in the history of the Church and how the Western World got to where it is today, this book is one to read.e history of the Church and how the Western World got to where it is today, this book is one to read.	2004-09-08

Much of the book is a detailed explanation of whaling of the anatomy of whales.<br /><br />A segment of the book, mostly at the end, is the true novel.  The novel portion of the book is in the nature of an adventure story, along the theme of man vs. nature.  Ahab, the obsessed whaling captain chasing after Moby Dick to the exclusion of his commercial duties to the ship owner and the crew is matched against the powers of the great White Whale.  I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that, if you have an interest in whales or whaling or nature novels you will enjoy \\"Moby Dick\\".<br /><br />I started reading \\"Moby Dick\\" after reading Jacques Cousteau's \\"Whales\\" (see may Amazon review) in preparation for a vacation which included a whale watch.  Cousteau's many quotes of Melville drove me to seek their source.  For this I was satisfied.  I do not consider \\"Moby Dick\\" to be a great novel.  The character development, save that of Ahab's obsession, is shallow to non-existant.  The action scenes do grip your attention.  Toward its end this is a book that you will not want to put down.  There are some interesting \\"time capsules\\" in its pages, such as the repeated references to whales as fish, a misnomer thoroughly dispelled at modern marine parks.  A reminder that \\"Moby Dick\\" was written in 1851 is the warning to a Negro crewman: \\"I won't pick you up if you jump...We can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama\\"<br /><br />Overall I give \\"Moby Dick\\" a moderate recommendation.	2004-08-30

Spread over several centuries, the conflict between civilized Europeans and other Mediterraneans and invaders from outside the civilized world is studied from several angles.  The ethnic backgrounds, economic traits and weaponry of each major group are explained.<br /><br />The book covers the Barbarian groups, highlighting the differences between the various groups and the civilizations which they encountered.<br /><br />A major theme of the book is the melding of civilization with the Barbarian culture.  Over time the Barbarian marauder of one generation spawned the later defender of civilization.  For the Barbarian the appetite for plunder was often tempered by appreciation of the benefits a civilized life.  For this, many Barbarian chieftains gladly made the transition to the status of European noblemen.  These transitions resulted in the Barbarian invasions being less a wave of destruction and more a process of change.  Both the Barbarians and civilized world were changed by their encounters.<br /><br />This book included some concepts which I had not previously appreciated.  It defined \\"Barbarian\\" in terms more broadly than I had envisioned, including Moslem and Scandinavian invaders of Christendom.  I had always viewed the fall of the Roman Empire as a cataclysmic event, whereas Tim Newark explains that it was a passing noted only by a few traditionally minded writers.  There had been gaps in Imperial succession in the past and it took decades for many to realize that this was not just one more gap.<br /><br />I like books which challenge and change my understanding of history.  This one does that for me.  I think that it will do the same for you.	2004-08-30

The constant reports of harmonious relationships notwithstanding, there have been many ups and downs behind the scenes.  Beginning with a Camp David meeting in which President Johnson, driven by resentment of Prime Minister Pearson Philadelphia speech critical of Johnson's Vietnam policy, grabbed Pearson by the collar and shoved him into the wall, we are admitted to scenes which are revealing, shocking and/or just amusing.<br /><br />Although the book focuses on individuals, the reader obtains an understanding of the bilateral issues affecting U.S.-Canada relations over time.  The relationship would generally be torn between a U. S., too occupied to be concerned with Canadian issues, and a Canada pulled between the U. S. economic magnet and the British cultural pole.  This book is often organized from the perspective of the President rather than from that of the Prime Minster.<br /><br />Beginning with Sir John A. McDonald, Canadian Prime Ministers confronted a series of U. S. Presidents looking on Canada as an annexation target.  From Grant to Theodore Roosevelt, annexation remained close to the surface as a bilateral issue.  Although Canadian fears persisted through the administration of William Howard Taft, the focus of the relationship shifted to trade issues which threatened Canada's sovereignty, rather than overt annexation.<br /><br />Although throughout the relationship it has generally been Canada coming to the U. S. more than the other way, there were occasions in which Presidents, with mixed results, sought to use negotiations with Canada to embellish their records.  One big loser was President Taft, probably the first president to really have an interest in Canada, when, after years of Canadian free trade pleas, the Canadian electorate turned to Prime Minister Laurier who rejected Taft's free trade overtures.<br /><br />One fact of Canadian history which played itself out was the ambiguity of Canadian authority to conduct international relations.  The initial arrangement in which Canadian foreign affairs were conducted by Britain only gradually changed, sometimes on a trial and error basis.  The uncertainty over who had authority to commit Canada plagued negotiations during the first half century or so of the relationship.<br /><br />Fifty-six years after Confederation, Warren Harding became the first U. S. president to visit Canada with a stop in Vancouver on his return from Alaska in 1923.  The euphoria of his reception was dissipated by his death a week later.<br />According to Martin, the high point of the Presidental-Prime Ministerial relationship occurred during the FDR- Mackenzie King years.  Sharing the experience of having defeated Depression battered incumbents, they provided each other mutual support while leading their countries out of depression and through World War.  Roosevelt, the owner of a summer cottage in New Brunswick, one of the few presidents who really liked Canada, was the first to visit Ottawa.<br />The Truman and Eisenhower years were fairly pleasant with little to show for them except for the cooperation during the Korean War and the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway.  The Eisenhower-Diefenbaker friendship would be the closest personal relationship for the remainder of the book.<br /><br />With the election of JFK, things took a turn for the worse.  JFK and Diefenbaker detested each other, a problem which Kennedy handled by deliberately sabotaging Diefenbaker's unsuccessful reelection bid.  The Johnson-Pearson relationship would, like so many of that era, be poisoned by the venom of Vietnam.<br />The Nixon-Trudeau relationship was doomed from the start.  Personal incompatibility combined with policy differences to end the special relationship which had so long existed.  Trudeausought to broaden Canada's relationships, while Nixon preferred to stop feigning an intimacy which had vanished.<br /><br />Trudeau, the intelligent, witty, flashy, jet setter had the misfortune of being paired with Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan, all men cut from very different cloths.  Through all of this, he maintained a public cordiality with and respect for presidents from whom he differed greatly.  A preoccupied Ford had little time for Canada and a failing Carter administration was unable to fulfill its early promise.<br /><br />Up to the time of its writing, \\"The Presidents and The Prime Ministers\\" gives the reader a good insight into the personal relationships and the policy issues affecting North American relations over 115 years.  There is some sloppy writing, such as the repeated references to Prime Ministers as heads of state and a reference to Teddy Roosevelt moving into the Oval Office over 7 years before it was built, they do little to detract from the enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />This book ends in 1982 at what is posited as the nadir in Canadian-American relationships.  Led by two very different leaders taking their countries in very different directions, even civility between leaders was strained.  With America in decline, Canada, understandably, sought to reach out to the rising powers.  Trudeau's contempt for Reagan, so common among the \\"wise men\\" of the day, comes through very clearly.  Martin leaves the reader with an understandable explanation as to why the special relationship was over.  From the perspective of 1982, the author was insightful.

Beginning with the land, Professor Careless continues with the First Nations, followed by the Founding Nations, although I doubt that these terms were in use when he wrote, and through the struggle of empires.  British supremacy having been established, the gradual evolution into the life of the independent nation of Canada extends the story.<br /><br />In the early chapters the political, economic and religious lives of the colonies are very well explained.  This is particularly the case with New France, an era of Canadian history in which I have a particular interest.  The importance of the fur trade in the shaping of North America is made very clear.<br /><br />In the later chapters it is represented that much of Canada's development was directed by the national government.  As much as I appreciate the insights of this book, I find it hard to believe that government was such a dominant driver of economic development.<br /><br />Once Confederation was achieved, the evolution of Canadian history is very well explained.  I found it interesting to see how Canada acquired the attributes of nationhood so gradually that the achievement of milestones seemed, at times, to be almost imperceptible.  This is quite a contrast with the American experience with its sharp divisions of history.<br /><br />The development of the railways, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the post war boom are all part of the story of Canada and are very well told.  The problems associated with conscription are well covered.  Whereas other histories seem to treat French Canadian disinterest in Canadian wars as an unchanging element in the national character, Prof. Careless more discretely explains changes in French Canada's military participation over time.<br /><br />If there is a deficiency in this book it is that the emphasis of government as a driver of Canadian history may be overplayed.  I am more acquainted with the American tradition in which the government more reflects the country rather than molds it.  Perhaps Professor Careless' view is flawed, or perhaps that is one way that Canada is different.  This book makes me hungry to study further to find which conclusion is accurate.  Perhaps this is a sign of a good book.overplayed.  I am more acquainted with the American tradition in which the government more reflects the country rather than molds it.

The many pictures, both photographic and drawn, are used both to demonstrate the grandeur of these majestic mammals and as serving as visual aides in support of the text.<br /><br />This book covers whales from many perspectives.  When a particular topic is addressed, the major whale species are covered sequentially.  It tells about their anatomy, including their breathing, swimming and eating mechanisms.  It tells about their diet and migrations.  The history of human impressions of and interaction with whales, the place of whales in literature and the role of whaling are given much attention.  Many quotes from Melville and other writers of the past support the text.  Conservation and the need to ban whaling are major themes of this book.<br /><br />At first glance, one might be inclined to think that this book is just one with a lot of pictures and that it is, but it is much more besides.  The reader is introduced to an informative and interesting textual treatment of whales.  I read it in preparation for a whale watch and was very satisfied.  I plan to keep it handy for future reference.  Whether one is looking for a thorough introduction to whales or a nature book to leave on your coffee table, \\"Whales\\" by Jacques Cousteau is a good choice.	2004-08-21

The \\"Bard Of The Yukon\\" is well represented in this collection, but this collection goes far beyond the Yukon.  In addition to the Northern Nature poems for which Service is famous, this collection includes poems set in World War I which reveal the common humanity of soldiers and the inhumanity of war.  Poems set in Europe between the wars provide an insight into that Bohemian world. Whatever the topic, the reader will be touched by the poems.

Someone did extensive research for this book.  Although the brass are not ignored, most of the observations reported are those of the common people involved.  We read the observations of Japanese admirals, pilots and a midget submarine captain.  On the American side we see through the eyes of sailors who barely escaped from ships, who struggled to return to their posts and who responded with anti-aircraft fire.  Soldiers and airmen, both those on the ground and those flying into the war, tell their stories.  Housewives seeking shelter and searching for their children and contribute their the stories.  The impressions of children also add to the richness of the book.<br /><br />I found particular interest in the misconceptions which occurred during and after the raid.  Knowing what we know now, the extent of disbelief is surprising, but understandable.  The number of service personnel and civilians who thought that the raid was a drill in which live ammunition was mistakenly used is shocking.  Many thought that Naval and Air Corps personnel would be in real trouble.  After the raid the wild rumors of further attacks and invasions seems incredible, but it is understandable given the shock of the attack.<br /><br />At the end, Lord sums up the impact that the assault had on American attitudes toward the war in general and toward Japan in particular.<br /><br />There are better sources for the big picture of Pearl Harbor, the story of  the damage done to the fleet and the impact of the attack meant on the course of the war.  \\"Day Of Infamy\\" is the place to look for the story of the participants whose lives were forever changed on December 7, 1941.	2004-08-19

This is not the book in which to find the history of the battle of July 3, 1863.  This book records the battle over the legacy, the memory and the place in history of that historic charge.<br /><br />The tenor of this book came as a surprise to me.  I had always viewed Pickett's Charge as an ill conceived, vain attack, the only redeeming virtue of which was the heroism of the Confederate troops as they marched to slaughter.  I had always viewed Pickett as a goat, rather than a hero.  The only excuse which I saw for Pickett was that he only carried out orders for which he was not responsible.  I learned that my view is far conventional wisdom.<br /><br />Carol Reardon does a good job of documenting the battle over the battle from the original memories up to the most recent literature and films on the subject.  She begins by pointing out that the experience of each participant was limited to the field of vision of each individual, requiring the piecing together of many individual memories in order to assemble the puzzle.<br /><br />The first public reports of the battle in newspapers  were so fragmented that it took weeks before a consensus was reached as to which side had won.  Some early reports spoke of a glorious Confederate route of the Yankees.  In time, reality sank in and reports turned into a search for a scapegoat on whom to lay the blame for Virginia's glorious failure.  Pickett's Charge soon became a highpoint of Virginia's martial glory to be defended from all attackers. Suspicion soon focused on troops from other states, prominently North Carolina, and other commanders, who were said to have failed to provide needed support.  This led to a rival claims that troops from North Carolina and other states had done their share and, according to some observers, actually established a high water mark surpassing that established by Pickett's troops at The Angle.  I was surprised to learn that not all of the troops in the Charge were under the command of General Pickett.  Even the moniker of \\"Pickett's Charge\\" came under repeated attack.  Squabbles among Confederate heros led to disputes among union troops as to who deserved credit for having stopped the charge.  The title of decisive action of the battle of the war was challenged by veterans of Little Round Top and other actions during the battle.<br />Not only was Pickett a hero of Virginia, but, as the soldier most closely identified with Richmond, his memory benefited from the historical scholarship originating in that city.  His funeral attracted renewed attention to the Charge and his widow served, for many years, as a focal point for Pickett devotees.<br />Through the years, conflicts raged over the location of the markers which so serenely tower over the battlefield today.

This is not the book in which to find the history of the battle of July 3, 1863. This book records the battle over the legacy, the memory and the place in history of that historic charge.<br /><br />The tenor of this book came as a surprise to me. I had always viewed Pickett's Charge as an ill conceived, vain attack, the only redeeming virtue of which was the heroism of the Confederate troops as they marched to slaughter. I had always viewed Pickett as a goat, rather than a hero. The only excuse which I saw for Pickett was that he only carried out orders for which he was not responsible. I learned that my view is far conventional wisdom.<br /><br />Carol Reardon does a good job of documenting the war over the battle from the original memories up to the most recent literature and films on the subject. She begins by pointing out that the experience of each participant was limited to the field of vision of each individual, requiring the piecing together of many individual memories in order to assemble the puzzle.<br /><br />The first public reports of the battle in newspapers were so fragmented that it took weeks before a consensus was reached as to which side had won. Some early reports spoke of a glorious Confederate route of the Yankees. In time, reality sank in and reports turned into a search for a scapegoat on whom to lay the blame for Virginia's glorious failure. Pickett's Charge soon became a highpoint of Virginia's martial glory to be defended from all attackers. Suspicion soon focused on troops from other states, prominently North Carolina, and other commanders, who were said to have failed to provide needed support. This led to a rival claims that troops from North Carolina and other states had done their share and, according to some observers, actually established a high water mark surpassing that established by Pickett's troops at The Angle. I was surprised to learn that not all of the troops in the Charge were under the command of General Pickett. Even the moniker of \\"Pickett's Charge\\" came under repeated attack. Squabbles among Confederate heros led to disputes among union troops as to who deserved credit for having stopped the charge. The title of decisive action of the battle of the war was challenged by veterans of Little Round Top and other actions during the battle.<br />Not only was Pickett a hero of Virginia, but, as the soldier most closely identified with Richmond, his memory benefited from the historical scholarship originating in that city. His funeral attracted renewed attention to the Charge and his widow served, for many years, as a focal point for Pickett devotees.<br />Through the years, conflicts raged over the location of the markers which so serenely tower over the battlefield today. Commemorations at quarter century intervals renewed rivalries and animosities for a century.<br /><br />The controversial Gen. Longstreet keeps coming up throughout the book.<br />Even recent books and films continue to present the \\"spins\\" which have been twirling since the days immediately after battle.

In order to understand this work, it must be understood that \\"Apologia\\" is translated more precisely as an explanation, rather than as an apology.  Newman apologizes for nothing.  He explains everything.<br /><br />John Henry Cardinal Newman was a major British religious figure of the Nineteenth Century.  A prominent Anglican priest,  leader of the Oxford Movement and proponent of the \\"Via Media\\", Newman's conversion to Catholicism created many hard feelings among his Anglican friends.<br /><br />This book was written as an answer to specific charges brought against him by particular people at various times.  Much of the book involves references to actions and words of those with whom he collaborated, corresponded or met.  At times it is difficult to maintain interest in charge-counter charges which make up much of the book.  Although some of the charge-counter charges seem of little import today, I cannot say that the book ever becomes boring.<br /><br />In some sections, particularly in his footnotes, Newman explains theological issues, although that is not the main thrust of the work.<br /><br />This book gave me a deeper understanding of Newman individually and of the religious environment in England during his time than I had had previously.  This book reveals the Anglican Church as a \\"Big Tent\\", so to speak, including a \\"High Church\\" which valued hierarchy and formal liturgy and a \\"Low Church\\" which more resembled the Methodist and other Protestant churches.<br /><br />Newman viewed the Anglican Church as a branch of Catholicism in England.  He was troubled by various steps taken by the Anglican Church, particularly the establishment of a Bishop in Jerusalem.  Newman's position was that there were virtually no Anglicans in Jerusalem and that the plan for the bishop to have authority over Protestants, a group with which Newman did not identify, was unjustified. If the Anglican Church was a branch of the Catholic Church in England, what business did it have establishing a bishop in Jerusalem, a non-British territory, as a cooperative venture with German Protestants?  He regarded this attempt to use the Anglican Church to promote British prestige and national interests as another unjustified interference of politics in ecclesiastical matters.<br />I had always thought that Newman's conversion and rise in the Catholic hierarchy were unusual.  In this book I learned that Newman was one of several Anglican clergymen who converted to Catholicism around his time, including another who became a Cardinal.  The Catholic hierarchy was restored in England during Newman's day so his rapid rise may not have been as surprising as it would have been under more stable circumstances.<br /><br />One might think that Newman's conversion from the Church of England to the Church of Rome and his subsequent treatment by some Englishmen may have dampened his patriotic enthusiasm.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Newman's status as a proud Englishman remains obvious throughout this book.<br /><br />In summation, this book is readable, interesting and gives the reader a taste of history and theology.

It provides us with valuable insights into his mind and his world.<br /><br />The longest entry is \\"Notes on the State of Virginia\\".  It provides a multifaceted assessment of the Virginia known by Jefferson.  Politics, the economy, topography, populations, flora and fauna are all included in this report.  I read with particular interest the reports on areas of French settlement in what is now Illinois, areas in which my ancestors were living but to which Jefferson had never traveled and about which he had to have learned from the reports of others.  Many insights into the Virginia of his day are very interesting.<br /><br />Jefferson's July, 1774 tome on \\"A Summary View Of The Rights of British America\\" give a preview of America's grievances on the eve of the Revolution.<br /><br />The next segment consists of Jefferson's public papers and addresses.  Some are well known, such as the Declaration of Independence, while others are obscure, but often no less interesting.<br /><br />The last segment of the book consists of many private letters written to a host of correspondents.  Some of these are rather mundane matters of personal interest, while others are occasions for expositions of political views and comments on the news of the day.  I found particularly interesting his comments on developments in France during its Revolution.<br /><br />I have long had an interest in Jefferson.  This book enables the reader to see him in new and deeper lights.  His thought, the breath of his interests and his genius shine on the pages of his book.  This is a book to read and then keep handy for reference.	2004-06-02

Written in 1905, it tells the story of Jurgis' working class family which had come to America in search of a better life.<br /><br />Arriving full of hope, Jurgis sought advancement through a home with the family, the Lithuanian Community, the Church, the industrial machine and politics.  Time after time, the naive workman was taken by those whom Upton Sinclair regarded as the oppressors of the people.  Every time Jurgis thought that he was a cog in the machine, he ended up being discarded when he was no longer useful to those in whom Jurgis had placed his trust.<br /><br />Upton Sinclair was disappointed with the results of his book.  Intended to win converts to socialism, it was his description of conditions in the packing houses which aided in the enactment of the Pure Food and Drug Act.<br /><br />\\"The Jungle\\" can be appreciated on a number of levels.  The action is well paced and holds the reader's interest.  As a work of propaganda, it is a model specimen.

As a report of the life of the early industrial worker, it is entertaining, even if its details are exaggerated for effect.  As a political statement, \\"The Jungle\\" is in the eyes of the reader.  For the true believer, it conveys the truth.  For the modern conservative, it is an antiquated and flawed view of the world, which, as time has shown, proposed a remedy which was never right.

I had read this book previously and reread it in order to increase my understanding of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy.  It is definitely worth a second read.<br />The first two essays cover Roosevelt's role in the rise of American Imperialism and America's rise to world power.  Later essays deal with the cementing of the Anglo-American alliance, China, the Far East and Europe.<br /><br />The two underlining themes of this book are Roosevelt's assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas and his search for balances of power elsewhere in the world.  His defense of the Monroe Doctrine is manifest in the resolution of the Venezuelan Dispute of 1902 during which TR prepared to go to war with Germany in order to prevent it from establishing a foothold in South America.<br /><br />An early major step in TR's foreign policy the establishment an alliance with Britain.  This move was a natural, as many in America's ruling class,  not including TR, were Anglophiles.  TR recognized that common language and interests cemented Anglo-American relations.  An alliance with Britain was essential to the establishment of a balance to the power of a rising Germany.  TR's restraint during the Boer War, despite his sympathy for the underdogs, was repaid in Britain's cooperation in the Venezuelan Crisis and its face saving, but ineffective, support of Canada during the Alaskan Boundary dispute of 1901-3.<br /><br />The main American interest in China was the maintenance of the Open Door policy, which could have been closed had any one nation attained the upper hand in China.  Despite his belief in white supremacy, it was Roosevelt's America which used a portion of the Boxer reparations for the benefit of China.  In his effort to establish a balance of power in the region, TR supported China in its struggles against Russia over Manchuria.<br /><br />In the Far East, in addition to China, TR's main interest was the negotiation of the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, an accomplishment which won him the Nobel Peace Prize.  Even more than a general desire for peace, TR was motivated by the desire to establish a balance of power in the region.  He recognized and respected Japan, an ally of Britain, and actively supported them in the early stages of the war.  He recognized Russia as the greater threat to the U.

I had read this book previously and reread it in order to increase my understanding of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy.  It is definitely worth a second read.<br /><br />The first two essays cover Roosevelt's role in the rise of American Imperialism and America's rise to world power.  Later essays deal with the cementing of the Anglo-American alliance, China, the Far East and Europe.<br /><br />The two underlining themes of this book are Roosevelt's assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas and his search for balances of power elsewhere in the world.  His defense of the Monroe Doctrine is manifest in the resolution of the Venezuelan Dispute of 1902 during which TR prepared to go to war with Germany in order to prevent it from establishing a foothold in South America.<br /><br />An early major step in TR's foreign policy the establishment an alliance with Britain.  This move was a natural, as many in America's ruling class,  not including TR, were Anglophiles.  TR recognized that common language and interests cemented Anglo-American relations.  An alliance with Britain was essential to the establishment of a balance to the power of a rising Germany.  TR's restraint during the Boer War, despite his sympathy for the underdogs, was repaid in Britain's cooperation in the Venezuelan Crisis and its face saving, but ineffective, support of Canada during the Alaskan Boundary dispute of 1901-3.<br /><br />The main American interest in China was the maintenance of the Open Door policy, which could have been closed had any one nation attained the upper hand in China.  Despite his belief in white supremacy, it was Roosevelt's America which used a portion of the Boxer reparations for the benefit of China.  In his effort to establish a balanceof power in the region, TR supported China in its struggles against Russia over Manchuria.<br /><br />In the Far East, in addition to China, TR's main interest was the negotiation of the peace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War, an accomplishment which won him the Nobel Peace Prize.  Even more than a general desire for peace, TR was motivated by the desire to establish a balance of power in the region.  He recognized and respected Japan, an ally of Britain, and actively supported them in the early stages of the war.  He recognized Russia as the greater threat to the U. S. and was pleased to see its thrust into Asia blunted.  His intervention with both the Japanese and Czar Nicholas was instrumental in preventing a breakdown in the Portsmouth Peace Conference, an action which saved Japan from bankruptcy and Russia from further military disaster.  After the war, TR acted, through the cruise of the Great White Fleet, to impress upon an emboldened Japan the folly of taking on the United States as it had Russia.<br /><br />Perhaps TR's most assertive foreign policy initiatives involved his role in the Algerciras Conference on Morocco in 1905.

Both arrived in Washington in 1890, TR as a member of the Civil Service Commission and Taft to serve as Solicitor General.  Taft accepted his position as a supposed stepping stone to the U. S. Supreme Court.  As TR rose to the Presidency, he would be instrumental in guiding Taft to either executive or judicial office.  While Taft longed for the reflective life of the judiciary, his wife, Helen, lived for life in the White House.  It was TR who sent Taft on a diplomatic mission to Asia with Alice Roosevelt and appointed him to the posts of Governor General of the Philippines and Secretary of War.  In 1902, TR offered Taft a Supreme Court appointment but Taft, at Helen's urging, declined, citing his obligation to the Philippine assignment.  In 1906, an enhanced offer was extended with the added promise that, if the Chief Justiceship would become vacant during TR's term, Taft would be elevated to that position.  The offer was, again, declined because, as son Charlie Taft said, \\"Ma wants him to wait and be President.\\"<br /><br />TR's election night, 1905, statement that he would never \\"be a candidate for or accept another nomination\\" started a race to succeed him in 1908.  The three leading candidates were Elihu Root, whose corporate ties made him unelectable, Charles Evans Hughes, whom TR disliked, and Taft.  Upon selecting Taft, TR proceeded to work for his election, at times more vigorously than did Taft himself.<br />With the commencement of the transfer of power, wariness entered the relationship.  Although TR stayed true to his word, the Tafts remained worried that the convention, on its own initiative, would nominate TR.  When the Roosevelt demonstration outlasted Taft's, the signs seemed ominous until the roll call completed the hand over of the GOP to Taft.<br /><br />Throughout the 1908 campaign, TR's dissatisfaction with Taft grew, but nevertheless, the Tafts were White House guests of the Roosevelts on the eve of the Inauguration.  The Inauguration Day blizzard was claimed by Roosevelt, \\"I knew there'd be a blizzard when I went out\\" and by Taft \\"You're wrong, it is my storm.  I always said it would be a cold day when I got to be President of the United States.\\"<br /><br />Throughout Taft's administration, TR remained the 800 pound gorilla whose approval Taft always desired, but never totally achieved.  While on an African safari, TR received disturbing rumors of policy and personnel changes made by Taft.  During his regal tour of Europe, the TR tide role as Taft watched with helplessness and trepidation.<br /><br />Upon his triumphant return to the states, TR adopted a gradually more aggressive posture toward Taft leading to their rivalry for the 1912 nomination.  After TR won the primaries but lost in the convention due to, in the minds of TR and his supporters, dishonorable  tactics, an acrimonious split occurred as Progressives bolted the Chicago convention and nominated TR for President.<br /><br />By this time the friendship had degenerated into tragedy.  Although TR had hoped that a conservative Democratic candidate would open the door to victory,  both soon realized that their split would lead to the election of Woodrow Wilson.  The defeat of each other then became their overriding goals.<br /><br />After their defeat, opposition to Wilson would permit a guarded rapprochement but the feelings of intimacy were never fully restored.  This tragic split, so skillfully reported by Manners, would elect a president and leave a cleavage which would haunt the GOP for at least 70 years.<br /><br />I read this book after reading several biographies of TR with really modest expectations which were greatly exceeded.  I learned much about the TR-Taft relationship and the 1912 election which I had not picked up elsewhere.  It is very informative and is written in a style which holds the readers' interest.en in a style which holds the readers' interest.	2004-04-21

To anyone wondering what \\"Beyond the Wild Blue: A History of the U.S. Air Force 1947-1997\\" is about, I would recommend a careful look at the title. The title tells one exactly what the book is and is not. It is not a history of American Airpower, although the development of the Army Air Corps is briefly presented as background. It is not a history of the Air Force in war, although the war record of the Air Force is given its due. Beyond the Wild Blue is the history of the U.S. Air Force during the first 50 years of its existence. It is, in essence, an organizational history of the Air Force.<br /><br />Reviewers often report that an historical book \\"reads like a novel\\". I would say that Beyond the Wild Blue develops like a novel. At the end of a novel the reader often realizes that it possesses a theme or a point to which the whole book has contributed. That is the case with this book. The ultimate point of \\"Beyond the Wild Blue\\" is that the Air Force has been an organization which has constantly striven, through a continuing research and development program, to achieve its mission through the advancement of aerospace technology. Through his telling of the story of the Air Force as it developed from a stripped down force in the years after World War II to the technological marvel which won the Gulf War, Walter Boyne brings us to realize how the organizational strategy of the Air Force has brought it to the point at which it is the power which it is today. He also makes us realize the degree to which the Air Force depends on the technical expertise of its officers and enlisted personnel in achieving its mission.<br /><br />Throughout this book, Boyne mixes facts with his candid assessments of personnel who have affected the history of the Air Force. Generals, Secretaries of Defense and the Air Force as well as politicians all come in for forthright praise or criticism. Two of Boyne's heroes figure prominently in the story. General of the Air Force Hap Arnold, who had commanded the Army Air Corps in World War II, guided the Air Corps to its birth as an independent service and inspired its quest for technological superiority. General Curtis LeMay, more than any other officer, imprinted his personality and ideals on the Air Force, much to the benefit of the service and the nation.<br /><br />Through this book we see the Air Force, at its inception, as a force poorly equipped with World War II leftovers. Ill-prepared at the start of the Korean War and handicapped by politically imposed rules of engagement, the Air Force was, nonetheless, able to establish air superiority throughout the peninsula and, thereby, contribute to the United Nations' successes.<br /><br />Through the Cold War years of the fifties and early sixties, the Air Force preserved the peace largely through its capability to deliver nuclear weapons, both by manned bomber and ICBM.<br /><br />The Vietnam War was, for the Air Force as well as all of the American military, a frustrating conflict. The handicaps imposed by politically inspired rules of engagement were more serious even than those imposed in Korea. As an example, pilots were forced to risk their lives trying to destroy trucks individually, while being prevented them from destroying freighters full of trucks in North Vietnamese ports.<br /><br />After Vietnam, the Air Force continued its technological improvement at an uneven pace, varying with the political winds of the day. The ultimate payoff for the Air Force research and development programs would come in the Gulf War. In this war air control was established, not by defeating an enemy challenge in the air, but by preventing the challenge from arising. The destruction of Iraqi radar and communications kept the enemy planes hunkered on the ground. The ability of air power to pick apart Iraqi defenses and destroy and demoralize its ground forces proved the ultimate vindication of the Air Force research and development programs.<br />Throughout this book,Boyne presents an agreeable blend of narration about individuals, equipment, organizational concepts and war stories, detailed enough to hold the interest without leading to boredom.<br /><br />This book addresses all aspects of Air Force service. Fighters, Strategic and Tactical bombers Air Lift and refueling all are given proper attention. The recent reorganization of the Air Force Commands was clearly explained. The changing demands of the American public that victory must be swiftly achieved with few casualties, either of friendly or enemy forces or noncombatants, and the Air Force's ability to meet those demands were presented as a logical result of the continuing research and development programs.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the description of the refueling capabilities which can now keep aircraft flying virtually indefinitely. Equally impressive is the story of the B-52, which may have a useful life of 75 years from first flight to final retirement.<br /><br />At the conclusion we are presented with an Air Force which has the potential to deliver military punch of unprecedented scope and dimensions. In an era in which the availability of overseas bases may be limited, the Air Force has the capability, through refueling, of delivering ordinance to virtually any place on earth through missions originating in the United States. Although beyond the temporal scope of this book, the continuation of the technological advancement was seen in the Bosnian operation in which bombing runs originated and ended in Missouri by warriors who would spend their nights at home with their families .<br />This book is a fitting tribute to the men and women who have carried the story of the United States Air Force into the Wild Blue and Beyond.Boyne presents an agreeable blend of narration about individuals, equipment, organizational concepts and war stories, detailed enough to hold the interest without leading to boredom.<br /><br />This book addresses all aspects of Air Force service.

The shame of his refusal to serve which drove TR and his sons to on the battlefields of the world to seek to redeem Greatheart's failure.<br /><br />TR began his redemptive act during his service as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, from which post he played a major role in getting America ready for and into the Spanish American War.  This objective achieved, TR began an insatiable quest to get to the Front.  Leaving his family behind, he went to Texas to organize the Rough Riders, an improbable mixture of cowboys and Indians, lawmen and outlaws, westerners and Ivy League athletes.

Tropical diseases and years of strenuous life finally took their toll with TR's unexpected death on January 6, 1919.<br /><br />The military service of the Roosevelt family would not end with the death of the Old Lion.  His three surviving sons would serve in World War II, two of them dying in uniform.  Ted, Jr.. would win the Medal of Honor, a decoration which TR had been denied.<br /><br />\\"The Lion's Pride\\" tells the fantastic story of the life of an extraordinary family.  It is the best telling of the World War I era of TR's life which I have found.  To learn about either of these topics, \\"The Lion's Pride\\" is an excellent choice.	2004-04-10

The book ends when, McCullough believes, TR's character was formed.<br /><br />What I found most interesting about this book is not only what is featured, but what is not.  McCullough obviously believe that family played a major role I shaping TR's character.  The first, and probably greatest influence on TR was his father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., Greatheart to his family.  It was his father who was his role model and whose charitable works planted the seeds of TR's social conscience.  It was Greatheart who opened TR's mind to foreign cultures during the trips across Europe and on the Nile.  It was his father's observation that TR had the mind but not the body which started TR on a body building program to give him a body to match his mind.<br /><br />Miscast as a business man, Greatheart used his inheritance in philantrophic work, supporting the Children's Aid Society, the Orthopedic Hospital, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the American Museum of Natural History, living his belief that social status came with accompanying duties.  Out of deference to his Georgia born wife, Mittie, Greatheart hired a substitute to take his place in the Union Army, while he initiated programs to help the soldier and his dependents, meeting Abraham Lincoln in the process.  This action is often cited as having created a debt which TR sought to pay during the Spanish American War.<br /><br />Greatheart's death at age 46 was one of the greatest tragedies of TR's life.  During his first day in the White House, TR felt as if his father's hand was on his shoulder.<br /><br />Other significant familial influences on the youthful TR were his uncles, James and Irvine Bulloch.  Exiled to England after their service in the Confederate States Navy, James, particularly, played a major role in developing TR's interest in naval affairs.<br /><br />McCullough obviously believes that TR's youthful asthma was a major factor in molding his character.  The reader receives a medical education on asthma, including the theory that its attacks are often anxiety driven.  McCullough then explains how he believes that TR's asthma attacks reflect what was happening in his life at the times of the attacks.<br /><br />Alice Lee, TR's first wife, completely captured TR's love before her passing drove him into cattle country exile.<br /><br />The critical high points in TR's early political career are well reported.  The incidents of his entry into politics, an unseemly profession for most of his class,  the challenges and disappointments of his legislative career all lead up to the 1884 Republican National convention, after which TR, frustrated in his efforts to deny nomination to James G. Blaine, chose to stick with party rather than to bolt to the Reformers.<br /><br />Some of the topics which fill so many pages in standard biographies are deamed to be less important to the theme of this book.  TR's early interest in animals and natural history barely attracts McCullough's attention, probably because after its abandonment, it had little lasting effect on his character.

Here we meet the generals and the GI Joes of the United States, Britain, Poland, Canada, France and Germany.  Starting with Keegan's personal boyhood observations of the American buildup in England, the reader is reminded that, for all the big stories, the war was fought by small groups of individual soldiers.  The reader is introduced to the strategy sessions, both in Washington and at summit meetings, as well as to the small engagements in which ordinary soldiers fought the war.<br /><br />Here we learn of Hitler's command failures and German transportation problems.  We read of the struggles within the American military over the competing needs of Europe and the Pacific.  The stories of fathers and sons and their units in the two world wars are compared and contrasted.<br /><br />I appreciate books which teach me something new.  This book meets that test.  I was surprised to learn of the intensity of support for the war across Canada, including in Quebec.  The accounts of the rivalries within the French army are interesting.  The reader is admitted to the interactions among the giants, Churchill and Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton and Montgomery, Petain, Leclerc and DeGaulle.<br />I enjoyed this book.  At its end I felt that I knew more about the war in France than I had at its beginning.  For this I recommend it.	2004-02-21

Quite A Book!	\\"Theodore Rex\\" is the second in Edmund Morris' trilogy of the magnificent life of Theodore Roosevelt.  Focusing on Roosevelt's presidency of 1901-9, \\"Theodore Rex\\" is a worthy successor to \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" (see my Amazon review).<br /><br />Chronologically arranged from the assassination of President McKinley to inauguration day, 1909, \\"Theodore Rex\\" covers the major issues to confront the Roosevelt Administration, both domestic and foreign.  From his first day in office, TR was confronted with the task of winning over the Republican party in order to ensure his nomination in 1904.  In this task he had to get around the hostility of McKinley's patron, Sen. Mark Hanna of Ohio.<br /><br />Domestically, TR faced a number of issues, some more successfully than others.  Although a believer in Anglo-Saxon superiority, TR did respect the accomplishments of individuals.  Race relations was one issue which TR confronted early and often, motivated by a mixture of interests, grounded both in politics and principle.  Much of Hanna's influence came from his control of Southern delegations, a particularly corrupt wing of the Republican party.  Having no power of their own, the Republican party in the South consisted almost exclusively of whites seeking federal patronage and blacks.  In a effort to gain leverage with the black wing of the party, TR made an overture to Booker T. Washington, making him the first black invited to dinner at the White House.  This overture was met with overwhelming disapproval by almost all segments of the body politic.  Attempts to appoint blacks to federal positions ran into Senate opposition.  Even to speak out against the practice of lynching tempered the courage of a leader with calculated political risk.  Toward the end of his term, his handling of the case of the 25th Infantry in Brownsville, Texas was to undue much of his record in race relations.<br /><br />Labor relations presented an early test when TR became the first President to mediate a labor dispute as he brought the anthracite coal operators and miners together, turning a potential political nightmare into a major personal victory.<br /><br />His prosecution of the antitrust suit against the Northern Securities company, the railroad trust, brought him into conflict with the captains of industry and finance.  This would be followed by his promotion of legislation to allow federal regulation of railroad rates. He would later work with some of these same captains in averting a financial panic.<br /><br />An early consumerist, TR lead the fight for the Pure Food and Drug Act, a measure inspired by Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" and opposed by strong congressional forces.<br /><br />Much Of TR's legacy survives in the lands he set aside in National Parks and his beginning of conservation policies.  Unimpaired by Congressional opposition, TR employed executive orders to expand the wilderness held for future generations.<br /><br />It was in foreign policy that TR had some of his most enduring and spectacular successes.  Confronted with a potential German takeover of Venezuela, TR reached back to the Monroe Doctrine and anticipated the war to occur with Germany in the following decade.  Unlike some successors, TR was able to go to the brink of war without falling over the edge.<br /><br />When negotiations with Congress and Columbia failed to secure a canal treaty, TR supported the Panamanian revolt and secured the treaty which would lead to the Canal which he considered to be the greatest accomplishment of his administration.<br /><br />Mid-Eastern terrorism was not unknown in TR's day.  The kidnapping of the American expatriate, Ion Perdicaris, from his home in Tangier, Morocco by  the Raisuli, placed the issue on the President's desk.  TR applied mounting pressure on the Sultan to achieve Perdicaris' release.  With warships in place, TR finally issued the ultimatum: \\"We want Perdicaris Alive or Raisuli Dead\\".<br /><br />Japan would figure prominently among his foreign policy initiatives.  Intervening to bring an end to the Russo-Japanese War won TR the respect of the world, as well as the Nobel Peace Prize, the first Nobel Prize won by an American.  Despite his belief in Anglo-Saxon superiority he admired the Japanese race and preferred their victory over Russia, a victory which he confirmed after both sides had exhausted themselves in their struggle.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, relations between Japan and the U. S. drifted toward war when the San Francisco school board voted to segregate Japanese and white students.  A combination of moral suation on the school board and a naval display in the Pacific delayed war by 35 years.<br /><br />The buildup of the Navy, which had begun during Roosevelt's service as Assistant Secretary of he Navy, was capped by the circumnavigation voyage of the Great White Fleet, concluding a month before TR's own term.<br /><br />At the end of his term, TR enjoyed an odd mixture of love by the people and hatred by the captains of industry.  He was still able to take pride in his accomplishments.  He had calmed a nation plunged into grief.  This most beligerent of presidents, with his soft speech and big stick had achieved his goals while keeping the peace.  He has showed, albeit timidly, how to treat those of other colors as equals.  He had limited trusts, affirmed the Monroe Doctrine, built the great Canal, brought peace to the Far East, faced down Mid-East terrorists, settled labor disputes, reduced the lynching rate, expanded the national parks and monuments, had become the first vice-president to succeed to the presidency and win a term on his own and had honored the two term limit.<br /><br />Theodore Roosevelt lived quite a story.

A life long Londoner, More earned his way into a rarefied world of legends.  Henry VIII was his patron turned persecutor, Erasmus was his friend and St. John Fisher was his co-martyr.<br /><br />In his early life, More lived a life of sanctity, but displayed traits which would not suggest a saintly temperament.  Working his way into high office in what was then Catholic England, More was confronted by the early infiltration of the Protestant movement.  A strong supporter of the Church of Rome, More aggressively worked to suppress the rising heresy.<br /><br />More's religious fervor, which initially put him in good stead, became a handicap when Henry VIII chose to divorce and remarry.  His religious consistency then led his patrons to turn on him.  His efforts to avoid taking a stand on the issues of the King's divorce and remarriage and papal supremacy ultimately failed to save his life.  Recognizing his fate, More made his last testimonies at his trial and in prison to supplement his prior writings such as \\"Utopia\\".<br /><br />Although this book does well at relating More's outstanding life and public career it fails to give the reader a feel for the man.  Upon completion of the book, I felt that I knew about Thomas More, but did not feel that I knew him.  I am glad that I read it, but I had hoped for more.	2004-01-19

Published in 1888, it displays Roosevelt's writing at this finest.  His picture words make the scenes come alive in all their splendor.  This is a TR I never knew existed.  For anyone with a love of western adventure, this book is it!<br /><br />Besides providing the sheer enjoyment of reading, this book actually teaches the reader much about the life and economy of the era.  I had always heard about the open range and the roundup, but this book makes the concepts clear.  Cattle and horses were left to feed on the open range.

It was this father who drove him through the streets of New York to get him over his asthma attacks as well as the one who told him that he \\"had the mind, but not the body\\" and that he must build his body.  When TR was contemplating a scientific career, it was this father who told him that he could pursue such a career, \\"if I intended to do the very best that was in me; but that I must not dream of taking it up as a dilettante\\", but that he would have to learn to live within his means.

As the Canadian frontier included much of the Midwest, this book is a good choice for both American and Canadian readers with an interest in the history of New France.<br />Prof. Eccles makes the point that the Canadian frontier is conceptionally different from the American frontier.  The American frontier was a geographical concept, the line where settlement gave way to wilderness.  The Canadian frontier, by contrast, was a series of settled islands in a sea of wilderness at which civilization \\"did business\\" with native cultures.<br /><br />One test of a good historical book is whether it changes the reader's view of history.  This one passes that test.  I had always viewed the competition between the French, British and Indians in North America as being based on basic nationalistic and tribal rivalries.  Prof. Eccles explains the rivalry in terms of an economic competition over the fur trade.  The roles of the Indians was to supply the furs.  The locations of the trade shifted over time between the eastern settlements, western trading posts and in Indian villages at which traders visited.  Traders competed in goods offered, while tribes competed, at times by war, to control access to traders and their goods.  Middleman profits were often at stake.<br /><br />The economy of New France is contrasted with that of the British colonies.  The economy of the British colonies was largely based on farming while the economy of New France was, primarily, extractive, based on the fur trade and, to a lesser extent, fishing.  Farming in New France was, initially, merely to supply the settlers.  As population increased and the fur trade declined, New France evolved from a trading to an agricultural colony.<br /><br />The trading pattern of New France determined land use practices as well as relations with the Indian tribes.  I had always thought of low populations of New France as a reflection of the unwillingness of the French to migrate to North America.  From this book I learned that low population density was indispensable to a fur trade based economy.<br /><br />Like the Spanish to the West, and unlike the English to the south, evangelization was a major part of the interaction on the Canadian Frontier.  Much of the exploration and development was instituted or accompanied by missionaries.<br />Over time, the Canadian Frontier was changed by tribal wars which determined the access of each tribe to western traders and their wares.  Although Indians are often portrayed as victims of white aggression, the truth is that they acquired a dependency on European goods which contributed to their own downfall.<br /><br />The military aspects of the North American wars are interesting in that they relate the relative contributions of the Regular forces, the militia and the Indians.  Another of my conceptions which was changed by this book was that the outcome of the French and Indian war was dictated by the colonial population imbalance.  Prof. Eccles makes the case that the fighting qualities of the French militia made them dominant over the English militias and that it was only the skills of the British regulars against the bungling of the French regulars which won the war for Britain.<br /><br />Ultimately, the world in which the Canadian Frontier arose and prospered changed and the Frontier disappeared.  The French and Indian War restricted the numbers of voyagers to a handful.  The vision of the French habitants changed from that of an open continent in which to trade for furs, to a river valley in which to farm and sell their produce.  The leadership of the fur trade changed from French entrepreneurs to British businessmen.  The British, who fought to wrest the Ohio Valley from the French, tried to close it to their own colonists.  Ultimately, the colonials who fought to take the Ohio Valley from the French took it from the British with French aid.  The Indians who had tried to play one power against the other, found that, in contributing to the downfall of the French regime, they had traded a benevolent, cooperative colonial power for one which would take their land and destroy their culture.<br /><br />Professor Eccles has told the early history of much of our continent with insight and a skilled writing style.  The supporting notes and bibliography guide the reader to sources for further research and reading.  \\"The Canadian Frontier\\" is a must for anyone with an interest in the history of New France.rench took it from the British with French aid.

Dr. Balessi introduces the reader to the major themes and players of French Midwestern history.<br /><br />French expansion into the Illinois-Wisconsin area was driven by the global expansionist policy of King Louis XIV.  New France was on life supports when Pierre Boucher, administrator for Trois Rivieres (and my ninth great-granduncle), was sent to France to plead for additional aid.  Boucher's three hour audience with Louis led to increased support for the colony, enabling to its expansion from the St. Lawrence into the Great Lakes area.  Taking administration from a syndicate, Compagnie des Cent Associates, control was placed in the hands of Royal officials supported by Royal Troops.<br /><br />New administration lead to increased exploration conducted by the likes of Louis Jollet, Pere Jacques Marquette and Rev. Jean Francois St. Cosme.  Initiatives in the interior sparked rivalries between the Jesuits, who wished to reproduce the success of their Paraguayan colony uncontaminated by outside influences, and other missionaries as well as with secular traders.  Encouraged by rumors of a river flowing to the sea, exploration depended on cooperation with the Indian tribes.<br /><br />Exploration gave way to development, prominently led by Robert Cavalier de LaSalle and his associate, Henri de Tonty.  In the course of founding a series of trading posts, LaSalle and Tonty established patterns of trade and loyalty with the Indian tribes, while launching the \\"Griffon\\", the first vessel to navigate the Western Great Lakes.  In so doing, La Salle brought the Illinois-Wisconsin area into the Canadian fur-trading economy.<br /><br />Eventually, the growth of the fur trade lead to increasing numbers of traders plying the Western waters.  By the end of the 17th century, the Illinois country was united to the new French settlements established by Iberville at the mouth of the Mississippi and the in area around Mobile.  Illinois now had outlets to both the North and the South.<br /><br />It was at this time that the Jesuit vision of a new Paraguay led to a rivalry with the missionary priests of the Missions Etrangeres commissioned by the Bishop of Quebec.  The first quarter of the 18th century would be a period of growth, with future great cities such as Detroit and Chicago rising, while the military bastion of Fort de Chartres was established to guard the Mississippi.  Amid this growth, European wars led to shifting borders and Indian wars in Illinois and Louisiana led to shifting tribal alliances.<br /><br />The increased settlements led to growing populations, not only of itinerant traders but also of communities of habitants, as Illinois became the breadbasket of French America.<br /><br />One of the most interesting parts of the story, in my opinion, is the story of the dedicated priests and religious who devoted their lives to bringing the Gospel to French and Indians alike.  This part of the French story illustrates the similarity between the colonial history of the French and the Spanish, in contrast to that of the English, for whom evangelization of the Indians was not a significant goal.<br /><br />Dr. Balesi's explanation of French relations with the Indians illustrates a distinguishing characteristic of French colonization versus that of the English.  The French model was to work, trade and live with the Indians, in contrast to the British pattern of supplantation of Indians with colonial farmers.<br /><br />Ultimately, the French and Indian War, with the resulting diplomatic agreements, ended the era of French political dominance of Illinois.  Thereafter, a French community shifted between an English east bank of the Mississippi and a Spanish west bank.  The rising tide Anglo migration to the west, ultimately, submerged French culture in an American sea.<br /><br />Though the eraof the French in the Heart of North America is gone, it is not, thanks largely to Dr. Balesi, forgotten.  Its story is both noble and inspiring.  It deserves an eloquent telling.  \\"The Time Of The French In The Heart Of North America\\" does it justice.o Dr. Balesi, forgotten.

Everyone who has felt betrayed by family will sympathize with Sowell's young life.  Everyone who has struggled with a difficult child will feel his pain when telling of his son's delayed speech.

As one who came in through the front door, he resents the implication that all successful blacks come in through the back door (affirmative action).<br />Sowell devotes much ink to dispelling notions that he played significant roles in the Ford and Reagan Administrations.  Although he is perceived as a Conservative Republican, he makes it clear that he is largely apolitical.  I find Sowell's position as one who neither votes nor belongs to any political party as troublesome.  Although his disgust with his treatment by political operatives is understandable, his decision to drop out of the political process is hard to understand.<br />Thomas Sowell leaves each reader to formulate his own opinions of the author.  Personally, I gained added respect for Sowell as one who has courageously surmounted daunting obstacles and has fought for what he believed to be right.  At the same time, I have to suspect that he is a difficult person to get along with.  He seems to have had a lot of family problems and has left an awful lot of jobs on bad terms.

Similarly, \\"Witness To Hope\\" is truly a book which uses the life and sayings of Pope John Paul II to convey the spiritual message of his life and ministry.<br /><br />In \\"Witness To Hope\\" George Weigel introduces us to the inner thought and life of John Paul II.  True, we do read of the events of his life, not so much to learn them, but to understand him.  In this book we meet a man who believes in eternal, unchangeable truths, a man whose relationship with each human being is based on a recognition of the individual's inherent dignity and worth.  Whereas other biographies explain John Paul II's life as reflecting his Polishness, \\"Witness To Hope\\" goes much deeper.  Here we meet a man who thinks in centuries, not sound bites, although he can speak in sound bites too, a man who can touch millions personally in the course of his travels, as well as individually in the confessional.  Here we meet the family, teachers, friends, theologians and philosophers who shaped John Paul's world view.  Here we meet a man who sees problems in a radical way, that is at their root.  With this vision, John Paul can attack problems at their course, not on their surfaces.  Here we meet a man who is not out of touch with reality, because he knows human nature at its core.  If John Paul has a problem in communicating, it is with people who have forgotten what it means to be human, a meaning found only in Jesus Christ.<br /><br />John Paul's Papacy has been highlighted by incessant efforts to evangelize and to teach the world.  His world wide travels have made him the Church's number one evangelist.  His extensive writings have laid the intellectual groundwork for a great Catholic revival.  This is only one of many contradictions in John Paul II which Weigel points out to us.<br /><br />The challenge which John Paul II sees it his duty to oppose is that of a world which tries to find its meaning of life in anything other than God.  In the conclusion, George Weigel defines the \\"Great\\" Popes as those who successfully confront a mortal threat to civilization.  John Paul's claim to this title will depend on how accurately he has defined the threat of our day and how well he has met that threat.  Read this book that you may understand John Paul better.  Whether he has earned the moniker of \\"John Paul The Great\\", I can only give the advise which he gives every penitent, \\"You must decide.\\"its meaning of life in anything other than God.

The brief biographies primarily cover the years each of these Ladies resided in the White House, although their roles in getting there are not overlooked.<br />The concept of President and First Lady as political partners is central to the book.  How and to what extent each First Lady fits into this mold is carefully examined.  The influence that each First Lady has had on her husband and his administration brings some surprises.<br /><br />We know of the public partners, such as Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton, as well as those such as Lady Bird Johnson, who would do anything to advance Lyndon's career, and Eleanor Roosevelt, the eyes and ears of Franklin, but there were others.  Who would have thought of Julia Tyler, the young second wife of John Tyler who, in her year in the White House, orchestrated a whirlwind entertainment campaign to achieve the annexation of Texas.  Another second wife, Edith Wilson, virtually ran the country during her husband's two year illness after his stroke.  There were those, such as Julia Grant and Helen Taft, who wanted the White House worse than their husbands.<br /><br />Margaret Truman does an excellent job at categorizing the First Ladies topically.  Among the tragic topics are those who may have been killed by newsprint, Rachel Jackson and Lou Hoover.  Maligned First Ladies, such as Mary Lincoln, and those who lived with domineering husbands, such as Grace Coolidge, get sympathetic reviews.  No sympathies are wasted on the undeserving, prominently Florence Harding.<br />In  this book Margaret Truman gives us a splendid introduction to one of the most crucial jobs in our country.  I am glad that I read it.  You will be too.	2003-11-08

Now, with 25 years of Papal leadership to reflect upon, we can form our opinions as to how close the authors came to the mark.  In my opinion they came pretty close.<br /><br />The starting point of this book is that John Paul II is, at his core, a Polish Pope.  His Polish background shapes his world view and his view of the Church.  John Paul II matured in a society in which the Church was suppressed and in which a united front was the only way the that Church could stand up to the Communist authorities.  The concept of dissent within the Church was not known in Poland and would be little recognized in John Paul II's mind.<br /><br />The next point is the background of intense Polish Marian devotion which plays a role in John Paul II's theology.  The positions he has taken as a philosopher are explored to some degree.<br /><br />The authors next assess John Paul's interaction with the cultures to which he has made his early pastoral visits, primarily those of Mexico, Poland, Ireland and the Unites States.  In Mexico the issue was Liberation Theology, which John Paul identified with Marxism.  In Poland the main issue was the protection and preservation of the faith against Communist oppression.  In Ireland, the challenge was to preserve the faith nurtured in a simple, agrarian society against the onslaught of a rapidly advancing modernity.  In the U. S. the challenge was to make the Christian message heard above the cacophony of worldly sirens.<br />As an admirer of John Paul II, my biggest gripe with this book is that the authors either do not understand or refuse to recognize that John Paul's mission is to preach the gospel to all nations, not to mold the Church's message into a better version of the Consumer Culture.  If John Paul preaches traditional Catholic teachings to Modernists who want some combination of married priests, artificial contraception and abortion, or class warfare in the name of liberation, the problem is not necessarily because the Pope is wrong.  The authors imply a criticism of John Paul as being out of touch with the world.  They overlook the possibility that the world may be out of touch with true Christian morality.<br />As to the predications of his Papal course, the authors assume an initiative to the East, primarily to reunited the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.  Here again, the authors could not avoid implying a criticism of John Paul for not presenting an initiative more acceptable to Protestantism.  They only grudgingly concede that the doctrinal chasms between Catholicism and Orthodoxy are much less deep than those between Catholicism and Orthodoxy on one side and Protestantism on the other.  The authors' thinking is that Ecumenical success with the Orthodox Churches will make unification with Protestants easier.<br /><br />How has John Paul done, 23 years later?  Obviously, the attempt to unify the Catholic and Orthodox Churches by 2000 was unsuccessful.  The assessment that in Poland \\"people's expectation of eventual change has been heightened and that itself represented a new danger for the authorities \\" has been richly fulfilled.  The contrast between great personal popularity of John Paul II with less enthusiastic acceptance of his message remains.  The authors' completely missed the advance of the Church in Africa which John Paul has strongly promoted.<br /><br />Today there are several newer books which better assess John Paul II.  This book is best used to draw historical and stylistic contrasts to later works.umer Culture.

Pure history written like a novel, this is a difficult book to put down.<br /><br />I must admit that my knowledge of the Corps of Discovery had been superficial.  From the pages of \\"Undaunted Courage\\" I learned much.<br /><br />This book begins with the background of Meriwether Lewis and the vision of Thomas Jefferson.  We read much of Jefferson's interest in botany, zoology and geography as well as of his relationship with Lewis.<br /><br />Ambrose takes us through the preparations for the journey.  The collection of boats and supplies and the recruitment of explorers, followed by the descent down the Ohio and up the Mississippi move the Corps to the point of embarkation.  One thing that I had never thought of was the need for winter camps.  In our day, winter is an impediment to travel for a few days at most.  The Corps, by contrast, went into winter camps at Wood River, Illinois, Fort Mandan in North Dakota and Fort Clatsop on the Pacific.<br /><br />Ambrose takes us through the challenges of the expedition, both from the land and its inhabitants.  The challenge of mountains and rapids tested the mettle of the Crops.  The Corps interacted with a succession of Indian tribes, which often viewed each other as enemies.  The goals of avoiding conflict and laying he groundwork for an American fur-trading empire were only partially achieved.  Despite dangerous divisions of forces, no explorers were lost to hostile fire.  Although open warfare was avoided, they left behind an Indian Country in disarray and suspicious of American intentions.<br /><br />Well deserved attention is given to Sacagawea, the Shoshone interpreter without whom the expedition would probably would have been lost.  The communication process was so cumbersome that it is amazing that the Corps got on as well as it did.  Sacagawea would speak with the Indians and would interpret into Hidatsu to her husband, Touissant Charbonneau.  Charbonneau would speak to George Drouillard in French, who would speak to the Captains in English.<br /><br />Another interesting thread running through the story is that of the barter between the Corps and the Indians.  When many of the items brought to barter failed to satisfy, the explorers were forced to trade their own equipment for necessities.  The variety of trading skills among the tribes leaves the reader with an insight into the universal commercial spirit.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Ambrose follow the unraveling of Meriwether Lewis.  Driven by drink, disease and depression, Lewis failed to complete the publication of his journals and performed poorly in his role as Governor of Louisiana en route to his tragic end.<br /><br />True, Lewis and Clark did not achieve everything possible on their journey, but their record was memorable.  Overcoming winter and summer, Indians and animals, the Corps of Discovery earned its place in the annals of exploration.  \\"Undaunted Courage\\" is a narrative worthy of its subjects.

It covers all aspects of the American experience including domestic society and politics, army organization and soldier heroism.<br /><br />In the early parts of the book, Farwell explains the series of German actions which gradually drove an isolationist nation to war.  The tug of war, between interventionists such as Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, and isolationists lead by Sen Robert LaFollette, left Woodrow Wilson in the middle, his actions pleasing to no one.  We read of the extreme Anti-German frenzy which arose after the declaration of war.  The frenzy manifested itself in drill sergeants who repeated false reports of German atrocities, Billy Sunday's assertion that \\"If you turned Hell upside down you would find \\"Made in Germany\\" on the bottom' and mobs which stoned dashounds.  Although Liberty Cabbage and Liberty Pups reverted to Sauerkraut and dashounds, German Shepherds remained Police Dogs and wristwatches, necessitated by uniforms devoid of watch pockets, remained popular.<br /><br />With the declaration of war the problems turned to mobilization and equipment.  One thing which surprised me was the meager American industrial contribution to the war.  Where were the railroads and industry which had been so crucial to North victory in the Civil War, the arsenal of Democracy to come in World War II or the creators of cruise missiles and smart bombs?  In World War I the U. S. was definitely a supplier of raw man power to use French and British aircraft and artillery.<br /><br />General Perhsing's struggle to organize and preserve an American Army gets appropriate attention.  With the introduction of U. S. Troops into battle the focus shifts to heroes and battles.  Eddie Richenbacher, Quintin Roosevelt and Alvin York are just a few of the heroes mentioned.  This book is not all praise, however.  American shortfalls are reported and Pershing's leadership iscritically examined.<br />Woodrow Wilson is the leader whose performance seemed to alienate almost everyone.  To interventionists, including Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson was slow to enter the war, deficient in mobilization and weak in accepting an armistice, rather than demanding unconditional surrender.<br /><br />This book is readable, enjoyable and informative.  I highly recommend it for anyone with an interest in U. S. involvement in World War I.	2003-10-15

Tad Szulc's theme throughout is that to understand John Paul II, one must understand his Polishness.  Polish culture and experience have molded Karol Wojtyla and have powerfully influenced his Papacy.<br /><br />Born the son of a minor army officer, Karol Wojtyla lost his mother at the age of 9 and his father while a 20 year old college student.  Having lost his older brother between the deaths their parents, he was left alone at a young age.  Undertaking his studies at Jagiellonian University, Wojtyla's education was interupted by World War II.  Karol obtained employment at a stone quary, thereby obtaining immunity from deportation.<br /><br />An aspiring actor, Karol Wojtyla saw Poland's salvation in the preservation of its cultrue.  His participation in the undergorund Rhapsodic Theatre was his contribution to the cause of keeping alive the flame of Polish culture in Kracow.<br />During this time, Wojtyla was introduced to  the works of St. John of the Cross by his friend and mentor, Jan Tyranowski.  These writings lead Wojtyla into the worlds of theology, philosophy and, ultimately, the priesthood.  Entering an underground seminary, he was eventually brought into the Archbishop's residence for safety while continuing his studies.<br /><br />Upon ordination in 1946, Fr. Wojtyla was sent to Angelicum University in Rome to continue his education.  There he was taught by Rev. Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, O.P., a Dominican who was to exert a tremendous influence over his philosophical and theological thought.  Touring Western Europe before his return to Poland, Wojtyla observed the priest-worker movement in France.<br /><br />Returning to Poland, Wojtyla had a career including pastoral, academic and administrative duties.  A major part of his ministry was to youth, with whom he would often go on hiking, kayaking or skiing trips.<br /><br /> An appointment as auxiliary bishop of Krakow introduced him into administrative positions and enabled him to attend all session of Vatican Council II, where he played an prominent role.  Promotion to Archbishop of Krakow led to his appointment as Cardinal.<br /><br />Wojtyla's rise in the Church was promoted by powerful patrons, such as Cardinal Sapieha of Krakow and Pope Paul VI.  His performance at Vatican II and his travels to Rome and elsewhere made him a well-known figure among many in the Church hierarchy.  Among the ironies in Wojtyla's career was that he was not a favorite of the Primate, Cardinal Wyszynski, but was favored by the Communist government which regarded him as apolitical.<br /><br />With the death of Pope Paul VI, the conclaves of 1978 convened.  Progressive forces supporting Cardinal Benilli and Conservatives backing Cardinal Siri deadlocked the conclaves, leading to searches for compromises.  The first conclave found its compromise candidate in Cardinal Luciani, Pope John Paul I.  The second, guided by Cardinal Koenig of Vienna and Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, turned to Cardinal Wojtyla.<br /><br />With his election, Pope John Paul II immediately began to win the hearts of the world.  Traveling across the globe, John Paul has visited many nations and confronted many challenges, with varying success.<br /><br />Much of the reporting of John Paul's Papacy deals with the Pope's involvement in the evolution of Poland from a Communist to a free state, an process in which the Pope is presented as having exerted a moderating influence.<br /><br />Later chapters deal with specific issues confronting John Paul II, including Liberation theology in Latin America, the role of women in the Church, issues over clerical celibacy, inculturation of the Church, family life and the right to life.<br /><br />At the end, Szulc gives an assessment of Pope John Paul II as a man who enjoys immense personal popularity and respect but who has not been able to transfer that acceptance to the Church which he heads.  While leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions, Szulc suggests that John Paul II may have failed in important aspects of his duties as head of the Church.<br /><br />Szulc deeply studies and evaluates the Karol Wojtyla and John Paul II of action.  I believe that John Paul's greatest long run contribution to the Church may be the vast store of philosophical and theological writings which he has produced.  I think that in these teachings may be the foundations of a great Catholic Renaissance.  You will find little reference and less exploration of the Pope's writings in this book.  Tad Szulc depicts John Paul II as a very intelligent, talented and dedicated man who has been both molded and limited by his Polish background.  Tad Szulc is limited by his vision.  This biography is very good, but does not tell the whole story of Pope John Paul II.hat acceptance to the Church which he heads.

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Early Cruises On The River	\\"Exploring The Great River\\" presents a collection of eyewitness accounts written by participants in early French and Spanish explorations of the Mississippi River.  Through its pages we are admitted to the historic expeditions of DeSoto, Marquette and Joliet, Hennepin and LaSalle.<br /><br />The narratives are interesting in their details of the explorers who unlocked the secrets of our land, the terrain through which they traveled, the fauna, flora and the various Indians they encountered along the way.  The methods employed to hold the respect and awe of the Indians provides an insight into their relationships.  My father had always told me that DeSoto's body was sunk in the Mississippi River so that the Indians would not know that he was, in fact, mortal.  I was glad to see that story confirmed in this book.  The comparison of the different Indian tribes and their attitudes toward Europeans demolishes the stereotype of Indians as an undifferentiated monolith.  In truth, each tribe was a separate nation, somewhat like the nations of Europe.<br /><br />While this book does not present the big picture of the riverine explorations, it does give some interesting facts.  Automotive historians may learn the inspirations for some car names of the past.  Overall it is an enjoyable and edifying read.	2003-09-19

From birth to death, Miller takes us along the path blazed by this Rough Rider.  I say that it is excellent because it presents this extraordinary life in fine writing style.  I call it a survey because it seems to run through 60 action packed years at the rapid pace necessary for a one volume biography.<br /><br />The outline of TR's life is here:  The sickly boy who \\"builds his body\\", the snobbish Harvard man, the New York Assemblyman and the young romantic.  Shattered by a lost love, TR enters the cattle business in the Dakotas.  His Dakota Sabbatical completed, he is ready for the return to New York, public life and his childhood sweetheart, Edith Carrow.  Rising through appointive position in the U. S. Civil Service Commission, the New York Police Board and the Navy Department, TR gradually deepened his experience and broadened his network.<br /><br />During his early life, TR was molded by personal tragedy.  The sudden death of his father when TR was 19 forced him into a more responsible maturity.  The death of this wife and mother in the same house of unrelated conditions on February 14,  1884 plunged him into mourning from which he found relief only in flight.  Leaving his newborn daughter with his sister, he went West to enter the cattle business which, incidentally, was a reasonable business decision at the time.<br /><br />By this time some of the major themes and ironies of his life had been established.  As a member of the New York Assembly, TR had established himself as a crusader for political reform and corporate regulation.  Although a political maverick, his leadership qualities made his political advance inexorable.  As New York Police Commissioner, TR created a sensation by enforcing the Sunday liquor laws and disciplining officers who were corrupt or who shirked their duties.  His late night prowls for sleeping officers became part of his legend.  He advanced the cause of Civil Service reform during his term on the Civil Service Commission.<br />TR's service as Assistant Secretary of the Navy marked his first major impact on national public policy.  A strenuous advocate for a strong Navy, TR's actions helped prepare the Navy its role it in the Spanish American War.  The instructions which he sent, on the Secretary's day off, to Adm. Dewey set the stage for America's overseas empire.<br /><br />The Spanish American War which brought TR to national prominence.  Seeking an Army Commission in order to fulfill a perceived obligation and to slake his thirst for adventure, TR also sought to redeem his father's decision to pay a substitute during the Civil War.<br /><br />Serving under Col. Leonard Wood,  TR developed the First U. S. Volunteer Cavalry, The Rough Riders, a colorful band of cowboys and Indians, westerners and Ivy League athletes.  Here TR developed and exhibited both courage and his leadership qualities.  In the process of becoming a national hero, TR earned the respect of his brother officers.  His charge up San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898 became an American Legend.  The Rough Riders were photographed on the top of the hill because \\"We shall always live in its shadow.\\"<br /><br />Roosevelt the reformer remained inside Roosevelt the warrior.  Saving the career of professional officers, TR testified before Congress about the poor quality of rations, an action which may have deferred his Medal of Honor for a century.<br />Riding his wave of popularity into New York's governor's mansion, TR continued his reforming ways, pushing a bill which taxed public service corporations .  Ever the practical politician, TR sought the cooperation of Boss Platt by consulting him on state appointments.<br /><br />Following a typically boring vice-presidency, TR entered the bully pulpit, the great adventure which was the Presidency.  His style was unique.  The first President to use the press as a tool, TR connected with the public as no president had done before and few have done since.  His young family and wild daughter, Alice, complemented his role on the national stage.  The main accomplishments of TR's presidency were the advancement of conservation, the extension of government control of corporations and the advancement of American influence in world affairs.  His brokerage of the Peace Treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War earned him the Nobel Prize for Peace, the first Nobel Prize won by an American.<br /><br />Retiring from the White House at age 50, TR lived out another adventure during his African safari.  This and his subsequent tour of Europe, reminiscent of the reception received by Gen. Grant, gave President Taft a political honeymoon.  Returning to the U.S. in 1910, TR launched into an increasingly radical attack on Taft which lead to his Bull Moose run for the Presidency in 1912.  This started a sad final phase of TR's career in which he became estranged from former friends and supporters while making new enemies, prominently including Woodrow Wilson.  A final exploration in South America nearly killed him and almost certainly shortened his life.<br /><br />For TR, life was a series of unforeseen consequences.  Abandoning his friend from childhood, Edith Carrow, TR fell head over heals for beautiful Alice Lee.  Alice is seen as a beautiful, but intellectually shallow companion.  It has often been said that, had Alice lived, Theodore would never have been President.  Her death drove him the cattle business in the Dakota Territory, an experience crucial to his rise to the Presidency.  Having become a thorn in the side of the Republican organization in New York, they maneuvered him on the road to political oblivion in the Vice-Presidency, only to have President McKinley assassinated about six months into the term.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Roosevelt: A Life\\" does justice to the magnificent life.

As we watch them lose their farm, travel with them in the truck to California, then search with them for work in their new world, we begin to appreciate the life of a penniless migrant of the Dust Bowl Era.<br /><br />As enthralling as this story is, it is periodically interrupted by chapters of social commentary.  Nobody seized the land, it was the bank.  No one set the wages, the growers association did.  There is no personal responsibility.  The little people are crushed by impersonal organizations.<br /><br />The theme of class struggle runs deeply, but is seems a bit dated.  When Steinbeck wrote, the Joads probably seems to be part of a struggle driven by deliberate decisions made by people who were willing to ruin the lives of little people for profit, all the while hiding behind the claim that their actions were compelled by impersonal forces.<br /><br />It seems that, to Steinbeck, the struggle over land was one in which \\"The People\\" could determine the outcome.  Knowing what we now know, the mechanization of agriculture set in motion forces which inexorably reduced demand for agricultural labor.  The prosperity which the world enjoys today is incompatible with world the Joads knew in Oklahoma.  The Tom Joads reaped the Grapes of Wrath, but many of their grandchildren eat from the Horn of Plenty.  The tragedy is not, as Steinbeck seems to posit, that the Joads lost their land, but that they were unable to successfully adapt to the changing times.  They could not adapt but, in their own ways, they did cope.<br /><br />Although the specific struggle of the Okies is passed and many of their grandchildren have achieved prosperity in the mainstream economy, their problem remains.  There are still economically marginal people unable to adapt to the changing times, people who have to cope in their own ways.  They too, have a spokesman in John Steinbeck.<br /><br />This book is powerful.  It is moving.  Come, ride into yesteryear.r problem remains.

Topically organized into seventeen sections, it distills true gems from his voluminous writings and public addresses.<br /><br />From these distilled gems the reader can glean some of the themes of John Paul's teachings.  One such theme is mystery.  Whereas modern man always seeks to know and understand, John Paul finds mystery in man, mystery in God, mystery in man's relationship to God.<br /><br />Another theme of John Paul II is that Christ is at the center of all human existence.  Whatever the issue, John Paul finds the answer in Christ.  Relations between people must be based on man's inherent, God-given dignity.  Man's ultimate destiny is found in uniting himself to Christ.<br /><br />Ultimately, the value of this book comes, not from the answers it provides, but the questions it gently leads us to ask.  Who am I?  Why am I here?  Where did I come from?  Where am I going?  When a person starts asking these questions, he begins to think differently, to act differently, to be different.  Pick up and read, think, and pray.	2003-08-26

I read it with my daughter in preparation for a trip to California.  It was an enjoyable introduction to this Christian hero who played a major role in the development of our largest state.<br /><br />From his youth in Spain, through his education and his pedilogical service at a Spanish seminary, Junipero was preparing himself for the great work of his life.  Responding to a call to be a missionary to New Spain, Junipero took the long ocean voyage to Mexico.  Anxious to preach to the Indians, Junipero was once again assigned to an academic life at St. Ferdinand College in Mexico City.  Eventually, at age 56, his pleas to be sent to California were granted.  Walking much of the way, this gray clad Franciscan friar established the chain of missions which would form the foundation of Californian society.  Spending most of his time at Carmel, Junipero became the Father of spiritual and secular California.<br /><br />\\"Wait For Me\\" is a charming story written in language which a child can understand and an adult can enjoy.  With much dialogue, it reads like a novel.  Don't Wait- Read and enjoy!	2003-08-24

The Australian economy of 1848 struggled with a chronic labor shortage.  Newspaper editors, anxious to retain the Australian labor force, tried first to conceal news of the discovery and, after the word leaded out, to discourage emigration.<br /><br />Ultimately, the failed attempts to discourage emigration gave way to a rush to be the first to bring foods and migrants to the California markets.  This book brings out some facts which would otherwise be easy to overlook.  Australia was one of the closest sources to the gold fields for goods and immigrants.  The trip from eastern Australia was shorter than the trip from the eastern United States or Europe.  This gave Australian merchants an advantage in the race to satisfy the ravenous appetites of the gold fields.<br /><br />The race to California was one with a prize for the swift.  The laws of supply and demand work ruthlessly in an economy in which the total available supply of a commodity may arrive on one ship.  Prices drastically diminish as each new ship reaches the pier.<br /><br />The description of life from San Francisco to the gold fields introduces the reader to the dynamic economy of the era.  Just as the gold fields drained labor from Australia, so too did it attract crews from ships, workers from San Francisco and Sutter's Fort as well as migrants from Latin America and elsewhere.  Machinery and other goods were imported from anyplace, including Australia, that could satisfy the roaring appetites of the boom economy.<br /><br />Although the Gold Fields attracted workers from near and far, a degree of xenophobia did arise.  Although directed primarily at Latin Americans, Australians felt that they too were trapped in its snare.<br /><br />An interesting side story was the escape from penal exile of several Irish revolutionaries who used the turmoil to find new homes. Among them was Thomas Francis Meagher, who would later command the Irish Brigade during the American Civil War and serve as territorial governor of Montana.<br /><br />The effects of the California Gold Rush on Australia were not limited to what it lured out of Australia.  It also affected Australia itself.  A number of Australian miners noticed a similarity between the California Gold Fields and certain land in Australia.  This led to the Australian gold rush at Bathurst.<br /><br />The discovery of gold in Australia led to a return to Australians who had tasted republican ways in California as well as the immigration of Americans who brought with them their own ideas of liberty.  The volatile mixture of returned Australians, Americans republicans and rebellious Irish led to a minor rebellion in 1854 which was suppressed by Redcoats in a fifteen minute skirmish.<br /><br />All in all this is an interesting book from both the Californian and Australian perspectives.  I recommend it to any with an interest in the history of either./><br />An interesting side story was the escape from penal exile of several Irish revolutionaries who used the turmoil to find new homes.

The Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An Interesting, Anecdotal History	\\"Disaster!\\" is an interesting, anecdotal account of the lives of those who lived through the Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906.  The characters are many, both major an minor.  After all of the attention to the September 11 attacks, it is worthwhile to step back and take a look at a natural, and even more destructive, disaster.<br /><br />Among the major characters are Mayor Eugene Schmitz, Gen. Franklin Funston and Acting Fire Chief John Dougherty.<br /><br />Mayor Eugene Schmitz was a former concert violinist and concert conductor who had come to power at the head of the Union Labor Party.  Although committed to the promotion of the cause of  Labor, he used his power to direct graft to himself and his friends.  In the earthquake he saw an opportunity to win support which might keep him out of a well  deserved prison term.<br /><br />Gen. Franklin Funston, deputy commander of the army garrison at the Presidio, ordered  his troops into the city to render assistance and to restore order.  By force of his troops, Funston became, for a few days, the virtual dictator of San Francisco.<br /><br />Assistant Fire Chief John Dougherty succeeded to the head of the SFFD upon the death of Chief Dennis Sullivan early in the crisis.  It was he who rallied the fire fighters through the four days of seemingly hopeless struggle against the all consuming fire.<br /><br />Amadeo Peter Gianini, founder of the Bank of Italy, which would, in time, become the current Bank of America, assured his place in history and the future of the Bank, by moving the vault contents to his home before the bank was destroyed by the fire.<br /><br />Although the earthquake did much of the damage, even more was done by the resulting fires.  Fires started by upset stoves and broken gas pipes spread and merged until most of the city was in ashes.  Hampered by lack of water due to water mains broken by the fire, the heroic fire department had little other than dynamite with which to fight the fire until its progress toward the shoreline and the arrival of naval fire fighting vessels made brine available.<br /><br />Police and troops used force and coercion to obtain the labor necessary to clear debris and render aid. Unfortunately, the troops also shot many innocent citizens and helped themselves to a liberal share of the booty.<br /><br />Most of all, \\"Disaster!\\" is the story of people, ordinary or famous, who made their way through the chaos.  The strong point of this book is less the revelation of a unified story than the interweaving of a collection of individual anecdotes.  Enrico Caruso had canceled a performance in Naples due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, only to perform in San Francisco the night before the earthquake.  San Franciscans fled their homes, married and gave birth and did so many other things while their world crashed around them.  Ultimately, San Francisco survived and rose like the Phoenix to create a city greater than any they had enjoyed before.

Lee.  It gives us a glimpse into their lives and the stages on which they played.<br /><br />One theme which runs through the book was that this family had many failures.  Although there were shining lights, such as Richard Henry Lee and Robert E. Lee, the more typical Lee was R.E. Lee's father, Gen. Lighthorse Harry Lee, who squandered his wealth, spent time in debtor's prison and ended his life in flight from his creditors.<br /><br />The two leading figures of the family are Richard Henry Lee and Robert E. Lee.<br />Richard Henry was one of the leaders of the call for American Independence.  As the sponsor of the Independence Resolution, he would have been a natural for the Committee to draft the Declaration.  His opponents in the Virginia delegation blocked his appointment, insisting on the conservative Benjamin Harrison.  Less conservative delegates blocked Harrison, with Thomas Jefferson being the compromise choice.  Oh, how history could have been different!  Richard Henry had a long and, on the balance, distinguished career during which he led the \\"Lee Party\\" consisting of himself, his brothers and other Lee relatives.<br /><br />The coverage of Robert E. Lee amounts to a biography lite, with an emphasis on his involvement in family matters.  There are better sources to learn about him.<br />Much of the book consists of quotations from letters and the provisions of wills of many people who would have never been mentioned in a book had they not been related to Richard Henry Lee and Robert E. Lee.  This makes portions of the book rather boring.<br /><br />I picked up two ideas which emerged from this book. One is the tremendous importance of inheritance for the Lees.  This may have been exaggerated because wills are documents which survive, but many people's destiny seems to have been dependent on the inheritance of a farm or a plantation.  The other is that it seems that, but for a few government positions, few of them ever aspired to any job other than to manage their farms.  This may reflect the nature of the economy and may also reflect the social  limitations on their class.<br /><br />Overall this book has some merit.  One could read biographies of Richard Henry Lee and Robert E. Lee and forget the rest, but then the reader would miss the story of how this family worked together over the centuries.

I was hoping to gain an understanding of the events which occurred as California moved from a Mexican to American territory.  At its end I was very satisfied.<br /><br />This is definitely popular history, not an academic tome.  The facts are related without a lot of depth or analysis.  Many quotations from other histories are included, suggesting that the information is primarily derived from secondary sources.  Although I was disappointed while reading the early pages, my appreciation of the book grew rapidly.<br /><br />The story of the Conquest of California is an interesting one, more for the infighting among the Americans than the fight against the Mexicans.<br />The \\"Bear Flag Republic\\" took its name from the flag adopted by a group of American settlers who declared Californian independence from Mexico and then enforced their declaration by the capture of Sonoma under a flag bearing the image of a California bear.<br /><br />The three main individual characters in the story are Lt. Col. John C. Fremont, Commodore Robert Stockton and Gen. Stephen Kearney.<br />Fremont, The Pathfinder, son-in-law of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, arrived on the scene at the head of a team of Topographical Engineers.  Assuming command of the Bear Flag rebels, he organized them into the \\"California Battalion\\" and lead them throughout the conflict.<br /><br />Com. Robert Stockton assumed command of the Navy's Pacific Squadron from Com. John Sloat who had raised the American flag over Monterey.  Stockton then commanded a force of sailors, marines and the Pacific Battalion which accomplished the conquest of the coastal regions of California.<br /><br />The last force to arrive was that of Gen. Stephen Kearney, fresh from the conquest of New Mexico.  He arrived in California with about one hundred dragoons and orders from President Polk to establish a government in California.<br />\\"Bear Flag Rising\\" reports, with adequate detail, the relatively small scale battles which decided the war in California.  It gives a good survey of the California Theatre of the Mexican War, one of three main theatres, along with Gen. Zachary Taylor's campaign south of Texas and Gen. Winfield Scott's march from Vera Cruz to Mexico City.  (See my Amazon review of \\"The Mexican War, A Compact History\\" by Charles L. Dufour.)<br /><br />With California secure, a dispute arose over the right to govern California between Stockton, claiming by right of conquest, and Kearney, claiming by right of Presidential appointment.  Lt. Col. Fremont's decision to accept orders from Stockton resulted in his court martial at the instigation of Gen. Kearney.<br />All in all, I recommend \\"Bear Flag Rising\\" to anyone with an interest in the California campaign of the Mexican War.th adequate detail, the relatively small scale battles which decided the war in California.

Dunn).  Each book approaches the era a little bit differently and \\"Europe In The Seventeenth Century\\" is no exception.  I like its approach. It starts by addressing the underlying trends in economic development, political theory and practice, the scientific and intellectual revolutions, religion and the arts.  It then delves into the actual developments in war and the revival of France from Henry IV to Louis XIV, with special attention paid to the contributions of their great statesmen Cardinals, Richelieu and Mazarin.  Louis XIV's establishment of the absolute monarchy is related as the leading story of the age.  Despite his stature as the most admired monarch in Europe, Louis closed his career in retreat before a united front of European foes.<br />The remarkable tale of the Dutch Republic is skillfully told.  I find it interesting.  This small country, devoid of resources, established itself through trade and skillful diplomatic balancing acts.  Its attempt to establish itself as a republic in a continent of monarchies ultimately was abandoned when it sought leadership from the House of Orange.<br />The decline of Spain, leading to the War of Spanish Succession, almost led Europe to either French domination of the world or a continent wide war.<br />The section on the transition of the Hapsburg empire form a hodgepodge of territories related only by allegiance to a common monarch to a geographically contiguous Danubian monarchy chronicled a development which would affect Europe to the present day.<br />An interesting, but less significant story, is the Swedish struggle for Baltic supremacy.  Although this was the high water mark of Swedish power, it had little long-term effect Europe.<br />Similar in its staying power was the monumental effort of Peter the great to modernize Russia.  Although seemingly of superhuman proportions, Peter's reforms ultimately, like so may foreign invaders, were swallowed up by Russia itself.<br />A test of a book is whether it introduces the reader to new concepts.  This book passes this test.  There are two key concepts I took from \\"Europe in the Seventeenth Century\\".  One is the wisdom of Leopold I of Austria, who accepted the loss of Hapsburg lands in the Netherlands to France in order to concentrate on the consolidation his position in Eastern Europe against the Turks.  This action established a Danubian Hapsburg Empire which survived for over two centuries and advanced the cause of Christendom against Islam.<br />The other significant insight is a French approach to international relations.  This book points out that, even in an era of strong religious fervor, France was willing to subordinate support for Catholicism to political gain.  In the struggle with the Catholic Hapsburgs, Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin were willing to support Protestant rivals of the Hapsburgs.  This subordination of principle to expediency seems to be a trait of French statecraft which has persisted to the present day.  Ironically, one of the beneficiaries of French support was the Hohenzoleran ruled Brandenburg-Prussia, which would cause so much trouble for France the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries.

Theodore was the founder of the dynasty who set the pattern for the others to follow.  Assistant Secretary of the Navy, hero of San Juan Hill, Governor of New York, Vice President and President, TR blazed the trail which others attempted to follow.<br />This book follows TR through his career, focusing on the themes which made him the Lion that he was.  TR's love of family, love of country, martial ardor and thirst for the limelight are all well explained.  The post-presidential years of frustration with Taft and Wilson are shown as hard times for TR.  TR's call for entry into World War I made him the leading opposition figure to Wilson's peace policy.  U.S. entry merely brought more frustration as TR was refused an Army Commission while his four sons all saw combat.  TR was proud of his sons, bled with them when they were wounded and grieved when Quentin was killed.<br /><br />The story is more than just the stories of the main characters. It is, in essence, the story of a family, the relationships of parents and children, brothers and sisters, cousins and in-laws.  The role that family life played in the lives of each individual is skillfully woven throughout the book.<br /><br />With his passing, TR left an idol to emulate and a trail to follow.  All of his sons, in war and peace, tried to carry on TR's ideals through public service.  The two family members who most clearly tried to follow the trail blazed by TR were Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and his distant cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Like TR, both would serve in the New York legislature, serve as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and run for Governor of New York.  Both attempted to run for vice-president and both as aspired to the presidency.  It was the rivalry of these two which split the branches of the family into a bitter feud.<br /><br />Theodore, Jr., Ted, was the first to try to journey down the trail.  Nominated for Governor of New York in 1924, he  was beaten by Al Smith, due, at least in part, to his unjustified guilt by association in the Teapot Dome scandal.  The prevailing wisdom of the day was that there was room for only one Roosevelt in New York politics at a time.  A tantalizing \\"what if\\" of history is that had Ted not been tarred with Teapot Dome, he could have been elected governor.  This probably would have made him the front-runner for the 1928 presidential nomination, leaving FDR frozen out of politics.  As fate had it, Ted's gubernatorial service would occur in Puerto Rico and the Philippines whereas FDR would be elected Governor of New York in 1928.  Despite vice-presidential speculation in 1924 and 1928, Ted's career as a public official ended with FDR's election as president in 1932.<br /><br />Although Ted's political career was ended, he continued to play a role as an opposition leader who contested FDR's claim to TR's spiritual legacy and who consistently reminded the public that FDR was not TR's son.<br /><br />FDR also idolized and emulated TR.  After a  vice-presidential run in 1920, his political career seemed to have been ended by his contraction of polio.  Initially depressed by his illness, FDR, \\"Feather Duster\\" to his Oyster Bay cousins, overcame his handicap and was able to return to the arena after a long convalescence.  The recuperative days at Warm Springs are given ample attention by the authors.  The reader follows FDR's long road back to public life.<br /><br />Although the fathers of TR and FDR had been friends, the strongest link between the branches was forged when TR, standing in for his deceased brother, Elliott, gave his niece, Eleanor, in marriage to Franklin D. Roosevelt.<br /><br />Eleanor andFranklin are portrayed as a misfit match.  Unable to find satisfaction in Eleanor, Franklin sought it in other women.  Eleanor, for her part, found companionship in a series of confidants, both male and female.  Their union became more of a business partnership than a true marriage.  Eleanor gave Franklin the appearance of a stable marriage, while he provided her with an avenue into public and political life rare, or even unique, among women of her day.<br /><br />The effect on their children of the Eleanor and Franklin's partnership is portrayed as disastrous.  Unable to maintain a normal relationship among themselves, Eleanor and Franklin could not build a nurturting family environment.  As a result, their children drifted from one relationship to another, in and out of shady business deals and had, what was for them, small success in politics.<br /><br />One test of a book is whether it presents facts which leads the reader to a conclusion.  \\"The Roosevelts\\" passes this test.  Although many other Roosevelts play roles in this story, we are basically introduced to two families.  Theodore Roosevelt headed a family bound by love and devotion to duty.  Although the hand of history weighed heavily on later generations, TR's family is portrayed, for the most part, as remaining loyal to duty, honor and each other.  Eleanor and Franklin, by contrast, begot a set of related individuals, for whom their heritage was not a call to service, but merely an asset to be sold.

Over the past year I have read extensively about the 17th century.  \\"The Age of Louis XIV\\" is the best book which I have found on the period.  Volume VII of Will and Ariel Durant's multi-volume \\"Story of Civilization\\", this book documents more detail of the era than any others which I have read.<br />The book begins with sections on France and England.  The next section is \\"The Periphery\\" dealing with Russia, Poland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, and Iberia.  After the geographically oriented sections, the reader is treated to sections organized along intellectual topics, such as science, philosophy, and faith and reason, which contain chapters dealing with specific philosophers or scientists.  The conclusion wraps it all up with the denouement of Louis XIV.<br />This book makes the 17th century understandable.  The premier character of the era was Louis XIV, the Sun King of France.  During his reign, the policies of he and his ministers established France's day in the sun.  Absolute ruler of the most populous and powerful kingdom in Western Europe, Louis made France the center of Western Civilization.  On these pages we learn about the Fronde, the revolt by the nobility at the rising of his Sun, from which Louis acquired his life long aversion to Paris,  Louis' aggressive support of Catholicism, while at the same time maintaining illicit personal relationships, and his generous support for the arts.  This era, rich in French literature and theatre, as represented in Moliere, is revealed.<br />The forces threatening to rend the Catholic Church further asunder, as well as the relationship between King and Pope, are dealt with in detail.  I was surprised to learn that Louis exercised a power over the Church in France similar to that which Henry VIII had previously established over the Church in England.<br />England, meanwhile, endured Cromwell, The Stuart Restoration, and the Glorious Revolution, while spawning Milton, Dryden, Swift and other literary giants.<br />Interesting contrasts are illustrated.  Whereas in France the monarchy was strengthened into absolutism, England was making hesitating steps toward democracy.

The first portion of the book is a biographical narrative of Theodore Roosevelt, with a strong emphasis on his family life.  The remainder is a collection of letters from TR to his children.  Although the letters are identified by topic, they are otherwise left to speak for themselves.<br />These letters were generally written to his children while they were away at school.  The letters are treasures from the Age of Letters.  Things which today would be communicated in person, by telephone or e-mail were, in TR's day, communicated and preserved in correspondence.  The letters cover a wide variety of topics.  Events of daily life of the Roosevelt family and evaluations, favorable and unfavorable, of the child constitute the majority of the letters.  Nothing was too small for TR's attention.  Horse and carriage rides, playing with children or wrestling with Japanese wrestlers, his tennis partners and White House visitors are all recorded for our enjoyment.  TR also used these letters to give vocational advice as well as to comment on public events of the day.  TR also expounds on his views on literature and history, as well as his views on family values.  The classical literature which he and \\"Mother\\" read to the children are mind boggling!<br />This is a book which is enjoyable to read and also makes you think.  TR's relationship with his children and his interactions with them provide a standard against which we can measure our own lives.  Read this book and treasure it!	2003-05-24

Feeling a need to become reacquainted with America, Steinbeck purchased a custom made mobile home which he outfitted, by his own admission, to excess, before setting out on his travels.  Although warned that his fame and familiarity would prevent him from maintaining his anonymity, Steinbeck was able to meet America at its own level.  From sea to sea he was recognized only by friends and relatives.  This anonymity permitted him to drift in and out of American society, tasting and testing, interacting and remembering.  From New England to California and back to New York, we are admitted to his conversations with taciturn Yankees and French-Canadian migrant agricultural workers.  Traveling west, we read of border guards, the representatives of the government bureaucracy, state specific highway designations and Steinbeck's observations of topography.  His roadside visit with an actor and his entertainment by rich friends in Texas provide a sharp contrast in outlooks and behavior of different Americans.  During his return to his hometown of Salinas, California, Steinbeck learns the truth that \\"you can't go back home again.\\"  Home has changed, his friends have changed, and Steinbeck had changed.  It is sad, but true.<br />Steinbeck dreaded the South but knew that he could not be avoided.  Traveling in 1962, Steinbeck saw some of the dramatic events of the Civil Rights movement while he sampled the prevailing racial attitudes of Southerners of the day.<br />At the start, Steinbeck was looking to become reacquainted with America.  I was hoping that the would finish with some wise conclusions gleaned from his experience.  He did conclude that Americans were more united as Americans than they were divided as residents of different regions.  He is amazed to find the degree to which diverse immigrant groups have amalgamated into a new nationality in less than two centuries.  I passed this on to a distant cousin in France with whom I have been discussing themes in American and French history.  Beyond this, we are left to draw our own conclusions from the facts reported.<br />I wonder how many of the people to whom Steinbeck referred have read and recognized themselves in this book.  How many of us, who did not meet Steinbeck, see ourselves or our acquaintances reflected in its pages?<br />This a a hard book to put down, so don't try.

In \\"Queen Victoria\\" I hit the jackpot! This book strikes just the right balance between revealing the life of the private woman, wife, widow and mother and the Queen of her people, while giving the reader an insight into the public affairs of her time.<br />Victoria's life can be divided into four segments. The first is her youth during which she grew up with her mother after the death of her father. During this segment of her life, she was protected by her mother to the intense irritation of her uncle, King William IV. During this period, Victoria and her mother enjoyed a close relationship which was to terminate after Victoria's accession to the throne..<br />The second era of her life can be described as the Albert era. Although I greatly enjoyed the TV movie, \\"Victoria and Albert\\", I understood it much more after this movie. Albert, Victoria's first cousin and consort, is the one who really emerges as the star of the book. Although reluctant to marry Victoria, she clearly fell head over heels for him. After their wedding, Albert became Victoria's trusted confident and advisor, to the point of becoming the defacto monarch. Always \\"The Foreigner\\", Albert won the trust and admiration of British politicians, industrialists, commercial and social leaders. In domestic relations, Albert helped bring about a reconcillation between Victoria and her mother. As a businessman who reorganized Victoria's estates to multiply their return or a statesman molding Britain's foreign policy, Albert was superb. An example of the importance of his influence is found in his last diplomatic intervention during the Trent Affair. The Trent Affair was an incident in which the Trent, a British flag vessel, was stopped and searched by a ship of the United States Navy, which removed two Confederate agents. An incendiary protest was toned down by Albert to one which would lead to a peaceful solution, rather than to war. If Albert had died a month earlier, the United States may have either lost the South or won Canada.<br />The third segment of Victoria's life is her tragic widowhood. Totally dependent on Albert during his life, Victoria was devastated by his death. For years thereafter she almost totally withdrew from her royal duties, despite the efforts of her ministers to lure her back into public life.<br />During the fourth segment of her life, Victoria returned to public life as the mother of her country and grandmother of Europe. Emerging to the adulation of her people, Victoria resumed her rides through London, her tours of the Kingdom and the entertainment of her royal relations. During this period a major portion of her diplomacy was involved with her irritating grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II.<br />This book certainly portrays Victoria as a Queen unlike those with which we are familiar. Not mere figureheads, Victoria and Albert were actively involved in public affairs. Among their surprising topics were dynastic relations and stipends for her children.<br />In this book we also get a glimpse at some of the political figures who Victoria loved and hated.<br />All things considered, this book is an excellent introduction to a most unique lady.f Albert had died a month earlier, the United States may have either lost the South or won Canada.<br />The third segment of Victoria's life is her tragic widowhood.

Reading like a novel, Hibbert imparts information while holding our interest.  Here we meet the leading figures of the Revolution, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Napoleon and many others.  While reading, we agonize over the fateful decision of the Royal Family to flee Paris and to seek rescue from foreign powers and cringe at the tragic descent into the Terror.  We read narratives, speeches, letters and diaries of those who made and lived through the Revolution.  From the reading of this book I have a much better understanding of the course of the Revolution and an  appreciation for the forces which impelled it as well as the tragic and seemingly irrational paths which it followed.  If there is any shortfall it is the concentration on events in Paris to the virtual exclusion of events in the rest of the country.  I am glad that I read this book.	2003-04-21

The book consists of six chapters, each with 5-9 lectures.  Each lecture begins with a few lines from the Epistle.  He then mentions a few points about the quoted lines, frequently doing this twice in the lecture.<br />The subjects of the Epistle include the questions of the relative importance of faith and works and the question of the role of the Jewish Law in Salvation after the Resurrection of Christ.  I found that St. Thomas' explanations opened my mind to some meanings within the Epistle that I had not previously seen.  For these insights alone this book is very worthwhile.	2003-04-07

I had always wanted to know more about Gregor Mendel since studying science in Mendel Hall during my high school days at Augustinian Academy.  This book gave me that opportunity.<br />Mendel was an interesting character.  Known mostly for his work in the field of genetics, Mendel was not a one dimensional character.  Born in Moravia of peasant (an honorable estate in the time and place) in 1822, the priesthood provided Mendel with his only chance to obtain an education.<br />His entrance into the Augustinian Monastery at Brunn provided Mendel with an opportunity to purse his scientific studies without the distraction of worrying about earning a living.  After ordination, Mendel taught at the equivalent of a high school.<br />It was Mendel's work in genetics that made him a subject worthy of a biography.  His work involved studies on the transmission of characteristics over generations of peas.  Mendel's conclusions were in accord with some the theories of Charles Darwin, a fact which limited the promotion of his findings among his peers.  His work did earn him the title of \\"Father of Genetics\\".<br />Mendel's scientific work slowed with his election as Abbot in 1868.  Mendel had desired the post because it enable him to financially help his family.  I do not understand how this is consistent with his vow of poverty.  As Abbot, Mendel dealt with issues of taxation, management of the monastic estates and offices in various scientific societies.  Mendel died in 1884.<br />I enjoyed learning more about Gregor Mendel than I had known before.  I was disappointed in learning so little about his contributions to the religious life of his community.  Overall this book is s worthwhile introduction to an interesting life which left me looking for more.	2003-04-07

This book consists of five chapters, each chapter consisting of 5-10 lectures.  Each lecture begins with a section of the Epistle.  After a brief explanation, St. Thomas gives a few phrases in which he tells what St. Paul says in the quoted section.  He then proceeds to provide a few pages of his exegesis of the quoted section.<br />The lectures give the reader an insight into St. Thomas' explanations for the scriptural texts.  The explanations vary from insightful to difficult to understand.<br />One of the best parts of this book is the Introduction.  The Introduction explains St. Thomas' approach to Biblical exegesis and his view toward understanding of the Scriptures. The distinction between the literal meaning of a passage and its distinction between the literal meaning of a passage and its mystical meaning are explained.  From the introduction and the lectures I gained an understanding as to how an intricate explanation of mystical interpretation could encourage a backlash of strictly literal understanding.  By the end I felt that I had a better understanding of Ephesians.  All in all this book is an excellent portal to Scriptural study.	2003-03-29

In \\"The Duel\\" we see that Churchill lead a parliament which was by no means united. Even though Churchill was determined never to surrender, there were others for whom a negotiated peace was a desirable option.  Not limited to pro-fascists, like Oswald Mosely, who was a real contender to lead a Quisling or Petain style government, potential peacemakers includes such British stalwarts as Lord Halifax, David Lloyd George and the Duke of Windsor.<br />Churchill was challenged to rally the French before their collapse, stiffen the resolve of Parliament and coax the U.S. into an alliance with Britain.  Although a failure with the French, Churchill was successful in holding his parliamentary support until he was able to gradually lure President Roosevelt  and America out of neutrality.<br />Hitler is portrayed as a calculating politician whose rise to the pinnacle of world power was not a fluke.  No madman, Hitler had a plan for Germany which he executed with skill.  The succession of sophisticated European visitors who were favorably impressed speaks of his charms during personal meetings.  In the pages of this book we read of Hitler's appeals to political personalities in France, Britain and the U.S.  There is a saying that \\"If you can't be good, be good at it.\\" Although tragically flawed, Hitler was good at what he did.  His personal magnetism, his \\"vision thing\\" and his insight made him, temporarily, the most powerful man in the world.  Fortunately he was not good enough at it to hold his position for long.<br />Besides the portrait of the individual duelists, we learn of some of the early operations of the war.  Of particular fascination is the case of Dunkirk.  One of the major unanswered questions of the War is why Hitler held his army back during the evacuation.

M. Synge during his visits to the Aran Islands just over a century ago.  Synge's journey had been encouraged by William Butler Yeats. \\"Go to the Aran Islands.  Live there as one of the people themselves; express a life that has never found expression.\\"  Here Synge gained an insight into the Irish character which would enrich his later works.<br />The Aran Islands are a chain of islands off the coasts of Connemara and Clare.  Isolated by the sea, the Arans, like the Galapagos in the natural world, preserve the language and customs of traditional Ireland.<br />The book is a narrative of what Synge saw and the stories he heard during his stays in the Arans, told by a master storyteller in the finest Irish tradition.  The language is delightful, the stories are entertaining and the insight into the Irish soul is profound.  A must read for any lover of the Irish.	2003-03-15

Beginning with the political and military background which lead to French weakness, the reader is carried through to the final collapse and its aftermath.<br />The parts of the book which I liked the best were the beginning and the end.  In the early parts we read how the tragedy of World War I set France up for failure in World War II.  France had been badly divided politically  for generations, a heritage which contributed to the disaster of 1940.  The massive kill-off of 1914-18 followed by the low Depression-era birthrate left France with a much smaller manpower pool than had existed in 1914.  The memory of World War I, along with the long-standing divisions in the French body politic prevented the French form preparing an army which could maintain the distinguished French military tradition.<br />During the reading of this book, I gained a deeper appreciation of the role played by the Maginot Line.  I has always heard that it was the last stand of fixed fortifications.  In this book we see how the costs of the Line and its personnel demands drained money and resources which would have been more productively devoted to other units.  During the \\"Phony War\\" the only effective relief that France could have provided to embattled Poland would have been an invasion of Germany.  The ultimate irony is that the impregnable Maginot Line formed a barrier, not only to German invasion, but also to a French advance into enemy territory.<br />The massive middle of the book explains the facts of the defeat of France in agonizing detail.  Although the credentials, such as thus usage of this book by the Israeli Armed Forces, suggests that this book has real value for the military professional, the endless recital of names and actions makes it difficult for an amateur historian, such as myself, to maintain interest.<br />In concluding sections, the narrative returns to more recognizable themes, such as the breaking of the lines, the collapse of the Belgians, the evacuation of Dunkerque and the last effort to organize a final defense in France.  This book introduced me to the depth of irony in the French surrender.  I had known that the French were forced to surrender in the same rail car and at the same location as the Armistice signing of 1918.  I was unaware that the Versailles Conference had taken place in the same hall in which Wilhelm I had been proclaimed Emperor of Germany in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War.<br />I did enjoy reading about the involvement of Rommel and de Gaulle, two figures who would play major roles later in the War and, in de Gaulle's case, thereafter.<br />Although this book focuses on French failures, it is balanced in that it does note that the British performed no better than did the French.<br />In the end, Horne explores the question of how the defeat of France influenced subsequent developments in Europe and the world.<br />This book may be a great one for pursuing expertise in the Battle of France but it is a bit detailed for recreational reading.zable themes, such as the breaking of the lines, the collapse of the Belgians, the evacuation of Dunkerque and the last effort to organize a final defense in France.

The book is divided into eight, topically organized sections highlighting the main themes of St. Thomas' work.  Within each section there are collections of his work dealing with questions pertinent to the section's subject.  Each section concludes with a list of suggested readings.<br />Overall I feel that the reading of this book I was introduced to a condensed version of Aquinas' thought.  What is missing is the \\"feel\\" of Aquinas' work which one can only get from a reading of a large, unabridged section of a tome.  Although I generally have little interest in abridgments, I feel that I have learned a bit of St. Thomas' wisdom.  For this \\"The Pocket Aquinas\\" is a worthwhile read.	2003-02-22

St. John was a Carmelite friar and friend of St. Theresa of Avila.  A valued spiritual counselor, many of his works were written as instruction to religious who sought his guidance.<br />The book consists of four major works and many minor works.  The major works are \\"The Ascent of Mount Carmel\\", \\"The Dark Night\\", \\"The Spiritual Canticle\\" and \\"The Living Flame of Love\\".  Each of the major works consists of a poem, written by St. John, and an extensive, word by word, explanation.  In the explanation, St. John reveals his own theology, supported by verses from Scripture.<br />The minor works consist of letters written to his contemporaries as well as a collection of St. John's poetry.<br />This is definitely not light reading.  The reader must concentrate on his the text in order to appreciate what he is reading.  I am glad that I read it from two perspectives.  From an historical perspective, it provides the reader with a good introduction into the world of mystical writing.  More importantly, from a spiritual perspective, this book gives the reader an insight into God's call to all Christians to draw themselves more closely to Himself.  The spirit of this book is difficult to explain.  It is a classical book which is better experienced than described.	2003-02-05

Its focus is personal.  We learn much about Catherine and her court, but much less about the greater world of European statecraft.<br />Beginning with her life as a princess in a minor German state with its frequent visits to the Prussian Court in Berlin, we are introduced to a highly intelligent girl.  The tale of her winter trip to Russia, \\"on consignment\\" as it were as a potential bride for the crown prince, makes us feel the incredibly harsh conditions of travel in those days.  Though well received in the Court of the Empress Elizabeth, Catherine had to submit to insults which would not be tolerated in a conventional courtship.  The Imperial Court, as described, is almost impossible to understand.  It seems as if Court was, essentially, an endless party.<br />Catherine's relationship with her husband, Grand Duke Peter, is pretty well explained.  Peter comes across as an uncouth dullard whom Catherine tolerates as much and for as long as necessary.  Among other games, Catherine played the role of a soldier in Peter's toy army, standing at attention for hours, while putting up with Peter's flagrant flirtations with other women.  Catherine's position remained in jeopardy while rumors of Peter's plan to divorce Catherine swirled throughout court.<br />For years Catherine's failure to bear an heir left unfulfilled the primary duty for which she was brought to Russia.  Peter's apparent disinterest in his wife and alleged infertility led Empress Elizabeth to encourage Catherine to take an extramarital lover, a liaison which led to the birth of the \\"heir to the Romanov throne.\\"  It strikes me as incredible that the dynasty would be saved by transferring it to an heir who carried no Romanov blood.  Such was the logic of the Romanov family.<br />As Empress Elizabeth's health deteriorated, rumors circulated that Catherine would rule, either as the power behind her husband or as his replacement.  A coup which overthrew and killed Peter put Catherine firmly on the throne.<br />Much of the portion of the book dealing with Catherine's reign narrates her degeneration into an absolute nymphomaniac.  The series of lovers is hard to comprehend.  It always makes me wonder how the upper classes, who at least had the Christian message available to them, could regularly descend into such debauchery.  In any event, Catherine's reputation declined along with her morals and her discretion.  Her most prominent paramour, who employed his relationship to achieve personal power and privilege, was Potemkin who, even today, gives his name to sham fronts as \\"Potemkin Villages.\\"<br />Catherine chose her role models well.  Prominent among them were the Russian giant, Peter the Great, and an Earlier Queen, Elizabeth I of England.  Like Peter, Catherine tried to modernize Russia through her correspondence with Russeau and other Enlightenment figures.  Just as Peter modernized Russia through the importation of Western technology, Catherine cultivated the reputation as the Empress who put Enlightenment thought into practice.  Like Elizabeth, Catherine ruled without a consort<br />During her reign, Catherine was successful in achieving the territorial extension of her empire.<br />Overall I enjoyed this introduction to this woman who clearly strode mightily across the stage of European statecraft during her era.  Through her strength of character and intelligence, Catherine usurped a dynasty and won the heart of an Empire.  The story is told in an interesting and informative way.  Both Catherine the Great and this book deserve our attention.replacement.

In this book the reader gets a taste of the uncertainty of outcome and the gore of the battle.<br />There were several things which I learned from this book.  One was that Napoleon was opposed by a makeshift coalition of British, Prussian, Belgian and Hanoverian forces which happened to be available in the area when Napoleon reassembled his Grande Armee.  Through the shifting course of battle a French victory, which seemed imminent at times, was turned into a rout when the famed Imperial Guard disintegrated in its assault.  The story is told in a way to infuse suspense into a story, the outcome of which the reader already knows.<br />An underlying current of this book is that the French defeat was the result of a failure of French leadership, stemming largely from the illness of Napoleon, which prevented him from providing the leadership which had led to prior victories.<br />Overall this short book presents an enjoyable narrative which gives the reader a general understanding of this major world battle.	2003-01-10

In \\"Wellington, A Personal History\\" I learned that he was much more.<br />This book is, as the title indicates, a personal history of the man, rather than a history of his times.  The reader learns little of the details of Waterloo, nor does he learn much about the impact of his career on the wider world.<br />Wellington's story is an interesting one.  Born the younger son of lower nobility, his dukedom was earned, rather than inherited.  His career was diverse.  He fought for the Crown in India before his first encounter with Napoleon's armies in Portugal and Spain during the Peninsular War.  The possibility of service in America during the American Revolution was mentioned, but did not occur.  The glory which he won at Waterloo was merely a stepping stone to higher service.<br />After the banishment of Napoleon, Wellington entered the diplomatic service in France.  This, coupled with his membership in the House of Lords, led to service as Foreign Minister and Prime Minister, among many other appointments.  In office, Wellington was, generally, a supporter of privilege and order.  Despite his dominant conservatism, Wellington was flexible enough to adjust to prevailing necessities.  Although initially opposed to Catholic Emancipation, he supported Emancipation after concluding that the defeat of Emancipation would have led to more social unrest than the issue was worth.  He then not only had to persuade opinion among the Lords and Commons, but also had to overcome the strong opposition of the King in order to get Emancipation passed.  This is of particular interest to me, as family legend has it that we are descendants of Daniel O'Connell, whose election to the House of Commons forced the issue.  Jews, whose potential for disorder was presumably less than that of Irish Catholics, did not enjoy his support when Emancipation for them was suggested.<br />During his political career, Wellington endured wide swings in popularity.  At times he faced the threats of the mob as a result of his policies.  He was forced to turn his home into a fortress and to carry pistols while traveling about London.  Even when his popularity was at its nadir, his prestige and personal presence were sufficient to insure his safety.<br />Wellington's relations with his monarchs make interesting reading.  Although he held George IV and William IV in low esteem, his relationship with Victoria was warm and close.  He became an intimate and trusted advisor on whom Victoria and other politicians relied as an intermediatory.<br />Wellington's marriage was unhappy and distant and he became a widower at a fairly young age.  These facts caused him to seek and enjoy the companionship of many women through his lifetime.  These relationships and their effects on Wellington account for a large portion of this book.<br />As is common among heroes, Wellington's popularity grew as his vigor and involvement in public affairs diminished.  Living to an advanced age, Wellington was revered as Britain's greatest hero.<br />I often gauge a book by how it makes me think beyond the covers.  I compared him to American political generals.  His political career was more impressive than Grant's, and of longer duration than Eisenhower's.  The closest comparison may be with Washington, both as his country's greatest hero and the man to whom his country repeatedly turned in crises.<br />My only disappointment in this book, as minor as it is, is that it is so personal that one gets a sense of his times only indirectly.

Reed was an American Communist and journalist who is the only American known to be buried in the Kremlin.  Throughout this book we read a series of observations and dialogues reported by Reed, virtually without comment, although his bias is apparent.  We read his reports of political meetings, encounters with minor officials and his observations of events occurring during those turbulent revolutionary days in Petrograd.<br />This book is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees.  The view is too up close to permit the reader to see the big picture.  One does not look here for the history of the Revolution.  We look here for its spirit.  Here we see the swirling chaos, hear the repeated buzz words and get a feeling for the competing factions which fashioned the Communist tyranny which emerged from the Revolution.<br />In writing this book, Reed gives the reader a view of himself and other American Communists who saw in the Revolution the future that worked.  His view can best be summarized in his comment that, while watching a funeral, he realized that the Russian people no longer needed priests to pray them into heaven because they were building a world brighter than any which heaven promised.  This hope is in stark contrast to the now known Communist record.<br />Overall I enjoyed this book as it taught me some more about the Russian Revolution than I had learned from other books which I had read.

The origins of the war and the military mobilizations get the book started.<br />Much of the book is devoted to the Western front, but all theatres are given appropriate attention.  The Eastern Front and its effects on driving Russia into revolution are thoroughly explained.  I was surprised at the significance of the war in the Middle East.  I was aware of the Gallipoli campaign aimed at forcing the Ottoman Empire out of the war by taking Constantinople, and of Lawrence of Arabia, but the intensity of the effort in the southern reaches of the Empire were also interesting.  The colonial campaigns in Africa and the Pacific are explained both militarily and in relationship to the colonial aspirations of the belligerents.<br />The naval campaigns, primarily the U-boat war, are well reported.  The adoption of the convoy system as a response to the U-boat threat was an example of the advances made in the techniques of warfare.  The narration of the Battle of the Jutland, probably the greatest shoot-out among battleships and other fleet vessels, is skillfully explained.<br />The Western Front is where the war was, ultimately, won and lost.  The interplay among the characters who played on the Western stage makes an intriguing epic.  The French search for a winning commander is reminiscent of Lincoln's search for the same, while the British Haig's untouchability reminds one of the revered Robert E. Lee.<br />After years of stalemate along the Western Front, the situation started to become fluid with the collapse of Russia and the entry of the United States into the war.  This set up a race between the German troops heading west from Russia and the Americans heading \\"Over There\\".  As we know, the Germans were unable to finish the job before the Americans and civil unrest in Germany and Austria-Hungary tipped the balance in the Allies' favor.<br />In my mind, three tests exist for an historical book.  They are whether the book provides an understanding of the subject, whether it encourages further reading and whether it introduces new ways of thinking of the topic.  This book passes all three tests.<br />After reading this book, I felt that I had a general understanding of the course of the war.<br />One character about whom I emerged with an enhanced interest was Woodrow Wilson.  I have long viewed Wilson as a largely ineffective idealist from whom one could learn little.  In this book he is seen as one who introduced a new way of looking at diplomacy.  His actions in overcoming American isolationism and introducing Europe to American idealism changed America and the world forever.<br />This book forced me to see World War I from a different perspective.  My impression of World War I had been limited largely to a vision of revolting slaughter in the trenches and mud of the Western front.  While this is a large part of the story, it is not the whole story.  Lloyd George's opposition to the Western Front mirrors Churchill's fascination with Gallipoli and his later emphasis of the Mediterranean theatre in World War II.  The thought that World War I could have been decided other than in Flanders' Fields provides a whole new perspective on the war.  The suggestions of alternative ways that the war could have concluded constitute a list of opportunities lost and tragedies which could have been avoided.<br />For anyone desiring an understanding of World War I, this book is a good place to start.s we know, the Germans were unable to finish the job before the Americans and civil unrest in Germany and Austria-Hungary tipped the balance in the Allies' favor.<br />In my mind, three tests exist for an historical book.

Author Alan Moorehead does an excellent job in telling the story of the Revolution from its Nineteenth Century antecedents through to its conclusion.<br />The reader becomes familiar with the world of the Czars, their insulation from the lives of their subjects and the Imperial Family's tragic journey to death at Ekaterinberg.  We are taught that the Czars saw Russia as their own private business to be run for their benefit, with little or no concern for the welfare of the mass of Russian people.<br />Czar Nicholas II emerges as a likable, but tragically flawed figure.  As much as we respect him as a good family man and wish that he could have managed a peaceful transition to democracy, we cannot escape the conclusion that he was incapable of taking the steps necessary to avoid revolution and thereby save his nation and his family.  With the coming of war, Nicholas could not resist the opportunity to lead the army in battle.  Ultimately, the army camp became less of an opportunity for leadership than a refuge from the turmoil in Petrograd and Tsarkoye Selo.<br />Lenin emerges as much more capable than Nicholas but, in a sense, equally as out of touch with the world as was his main protagonist.  Although Lenin is seen in history as the leader of the Russian Revolution, the truth is that through much of his career he was a failure who drifted outside the mainstream of the revolutionary movement.  During the years of exile, Lenin kept in contact with other exiled would-be revolutionaries, but had little influence on events within Russia.  It was only after the initial revolution that Lenin returned to Russia with the assistance of the Germans who expected him to exert his influence to take Russia out of World War I.  Lenin is seen as one who truly reaped what others sowed.<br />One thing which this book does so successfully is to dispel the notion that the events of the Revolution were inevitable.  Some events were, actually, almost incredible.  Was it inevitable that the Czarevitch Alexei would suffer from hemophilia?  How incredible is it that the Czarevitch's illness would enable Rasputin, an uncouth, disgusting, lecherous \\"Holy Man\\", to gain such incredible influence over Czarina Alexandra so as to make himself the defacto ruler of Russia?  What chance was it that, from among the myriad of revolutionary personalities, Lenin, the brutal late arrival, would emerge as the dictator?  What were the chances that Imperial Germany would cooperate in the overthrow of the Czar who, though being the Kaiser's enemy, was also a crowned head as well as his cousin? As I read about opportunities for the German Army or Navy to launch an offensive which would take advantage of revolutionary induced disarray in the Russian forces I find myself almost cheering for the offensive which would take Russia out of the war, but would also restore the Imperial system.  At times I almost I forget on which side America would enter the war.<br />Readers of this book have the advantage over those who lived its events in that we know what came of the Russian Revolution.  What turmoil, what tragedies could have been avoided if a few of these incredible events would not have occurred?  Would there have been the massive starvation in Russia in the periods between the wars?  Could World War II and the twin tyrannies of Communism and Nazism have been avoided?  Could Eastern Europe have been spared 40 years of slavery under Communism?

Covering the years, 1559-1715, this tome takes the reader from the End of the Reformation to the beginning of the era of the 18th century balance of power.<br />This book focuses on the big themes of history.  It tells the stories of Kings and warriors, merchants and clerics, artists and philosophers, but very little about the common people of the era.<br />This book is very well organized.  Beginning with the situation in Europe in 1559, the first chapter gives the religious lay of the land in the countries of Western Europe at the start of the era.  Chapter 2 outlines the beginning political situation in Eastern Europe.<br />In Chapter 3 the author studies the economic theories and commercial forms which fueled the economies of the age.<br />Chapter 4 introduces the reader to the political ebb and flow between absolutism and rising constitutionalism. Although the dominant figure of the era was France's  Sun King, Louis XIV, he was the architect of a system which would die in a sea of blood before the 18th Century was out.  In his day, Louis XIV lead the superpower of the age, but, toward the end of his long reign, he overplayed his hand, losing much of the territorial gains which he had temporally enjoyed.<br />The political upheaval of the era which was a harbinger of things to come was England's Glorious Revolution of 1688.  For perhaps the first time in history, a monarch's right to reign was made dependent on the support of his subjects.  Protestants William of Orange and his wife, Queen Mary, daughter of the late King Charles II, were invited by the nobles to challenge Mary's brother, the Catholic King James II.  The resulting overthrow of James, in clear contrast to Louis' absolutism, laid the groundwork for the concept of government by consent of the governed, which would receive expanding application during the succeeding centuries.<br />In Chapter 5 Prof. Dunn reflects on the Age of Genius which truly this era was.  Emerging from the intellectually stagnant Middle Ages, Europe erupted into a creative age virtually unique in history.  Science was advanced by the likes of Copernicas, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton.  Renaissance art bust forth under the creative genius of da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Durer and El Greco, to be followed by Baroque masters such as Rubens, Van Dyck and Velazquez.  Europe still glories in the architectural heritage of Bernini and Wren.  Our philosophy and political science still draw inspiration from the writings of Montaigne, Pascal, Hobbes Sponoza and Locke.  Theatres of the world still interpret the works of Shakespeare and Marlowe, Lope de Vega and Calderon, Corneile, Moliere and Racine.<br />The book concludes in its sixth chapter with an analysis of the new balance of power which would carry Europe into a new age.  A series of wars, Sweden's moment in the international spotlight and giant personalities such as Peter the Great would all combine to make Europe the place it would be in the 18th century.<br />Overall, this book is a good survey of the Age of Religious Wars.  I had not read a college text in a long time and I had more acclimated to learning history in biographies and books more focused on specific topics.  I am glad that I read it and give it 4 stars.ing application during the succeeding centuries.<br />In Chapter 5 Prof. Dunn reflects on the Age of Genius which truly this era was.

Beginning with the early explorers, we meet the heroes and villains who charted the northern rivers and lakes, cleared the forests, evangelized the Indians and built the country that grew into Canada.  The names from history books come alive on these pages.  Jacques Cartier, Etienne Brule, Samuel de Champlain, Jean de Breboeuf,  Msgr. Laval, Frontenac and so many others become real people to the reader.<br />The French settlers' conflict with the Iroquois receives much deserved attention.  The conflict with the Iroquois dominated the development and settlement patterns throughout the French era.  I always wondered how the Iroquois could give the French so  much trouble when the other Indian tribes were allied with the French.  In this book Costain gives the answer.  The Iroquois were more intelligent and better warriors than the Huron, Erie and other tribes with whom the French allied themselves.  The Iroquois not only harassed the French but actually destroyed some of their adversarial tribes, leaving place names as their only legacies.<br />I was surprised to see how much attention is devoted to the French personalities and events which had an impact on New France.  We hear much of Louis XIV, Cardinal Richeleau and other figures who shaped French policy regarding Canada.<br />I started this book in hopes of learning about my French-Canadian ancestors.  If finished it very well satisfied.	2002-10-15

Although written to her Sixteenth Century sisters in the Carmelite order, it is readily understandable by contemporary readers.<br />The premise behind the book is that the road to spiritual perfection consists of passage through seven mansions.  The last mansion is the Interior Castle in which God dwells.  In each succeeding mansion the soul reaches a higher level of sanctity and the attachment to the world decreases as the soul comes closer to God.<br />Although some portions of the book describe experiences beyond the expectations of modern readers, this work still provides us all with an insight into a way to draw closer to God.  While this book does not provide us with the only route to Heaven, I recommend it to all who are searching for guidance in their spiritual journey	2002-09-25

The alignment of forces and shifting military advantages are explained.  The ultimate arrest and trial of the King, followed by his execution, bring the war to its conclusion.  The ascendency of Cromwell was brief and his reputation swiftly tarnished until his rehabilitation in the 19th century.  The restoration of King Charles II lead to the veneration of Charles I as a martyr King.<br />The book is, largely, limited to a factual reporting of the events of the war.  The explanation of the causes and results of the war are brief.  There is little treatment of any underlying social causes or effects of the dispute between King and Parliament.<br />My rating of this work is fairly low because of the difficulty I had in following all the Dukes and Lords involved in the story.  Perhaps a reader with a greater familiarity with this era of English history would find this work to be more interesting.  I would rate it as a fair introduction to this period of history.  It would probably better serve a reader a more prepared for an in depth study  of the era.	2002-09-14

It is the story of the Washington Administration.  It is not a biography of George Washington, nor is it even a book which revolves totally around George Washington.  It is the story of the people, issues and events which made up the administration of George Washington.<br /><br />The book starts out with an introduction into the United States of 1789. The regions and interests, as well as the political alignments, which supported and opposed the adoption of the Constitution are explained in some detail.  The economy, trade, finance and the neighboring powers of Spain and England all laid the background for America's experiment with its new Constitution.<br /><br />The first task facing Washington was the establishment of the National Government.  While reading this book we come to understand just how little guidance he had from the Constitution.  Many of the practices which we take for granted derive, not from the Constitution, but from precedents established by Washington and his successors.  The title of address for the President and the role of the heads of the executive departments, which were to become the cabinet, were among the first issues to be addressed.  The role of the Senate in granting &#34;advice and consent&#34; on foreign policy matters had to be defined.  An early trial occurred when President Washington appeared in the Senate to present his proposals and ask for advise and consent.  After this awkward exercise, the practice was established that the executive would formulate policies and negotiate treaties, which would then presented for advice and consent.<br /><br />The power of removal of executive officers also had to be refined.  It was presumed by some that any officer who required Senate confirmation for appointment, also required Senate consent for removal. It was  the Washington Administration which established the principle that executive officers could be removed by the President without Congressional approval.  This was an issue which was to be resurrected during the impeachment of Andrew Johnson.<br />Beyond organizational problems, the towering challenge facing the administration was that of finance.  The debts of the Continental Congress and the states raised a myriad of issues.  Should debts be paid?  Should the debts be paid at par?  Should payment be made to the bearer, who had often bought the bonds at a discount, or should some or all of the payment be made to the original lender?  Should the national government assume the debts of the states?  All of these issues had important consequences to the credit worthiness of the government.  The assumption of state war debts had unequal impacts, depending on whether the individual state had serviced its debt or let it accumulate.  Ultimately the Hamiltonian proposal to assume the war debt of the states and to pay the holders of the bonds was adopted, with the concession of the location of the national capitol in the South to win necessary support.<br />An issue which would remain controversial until the Administration of Andrew Jackson was the establishment of the Bank of the United States.  One of the main reasons for the establishment of the bank was the dearth of banks in the country capable of handling federal deposits.<br />The domestic issues confronted by the administration introduced the spirit of party into the Administration.  The differing views and personalties of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson brought contention into the administration.  It was their personalties, particularly that of Hamilton, which came to be the heart of the Administration, even more than that of Washington himself.<br /><br />The second term was to be dominated by foreign entanglements and a domestic insurrection.  The advancement of the French Revolution and its wars with the powers of Europe brought European problems to America.  The continuance or renunciation of America's treaty, made with Royalist France, was a hotly debated issue, as was the ratification of a later treaty with Britain.  Acceptance of the Jay Treaty with Britain was, ultimately, decided in a reaction to alleged official corruption.  In America's first encounter with Islamic Terrorism, raids against American shipping in the Mediterranean by Barbery Pirates, resulted in, again after heated debate, the establishment of the U.S. Navy.<br /><br />1794 saw resistance to federal taxation on whiskey erupt into the Whiskey Rebellion.  The assertion of Federal authority lead to the raising of the militia for the suppression of the rebellion.  The declaration of the Rebellion and its suppression may have had more to do with Hamilton's desire to crush his political opponents and brand them as traitors than it did with any actual insurrection.<br /><br />Washington's ultimate gift to the nation was his retirement and transfer of power to an elected successor at the conclusion of his second term.<br /><br />This book is recommended to anyone desiring an understanding of the personalities who made up our first national administration, the challenges which confronted them, their responses to those challenges and their legacies to our country.ted issue, as was the ratification of a later treaty with Britain.

Once again, Catton explains the war from all aspects, Northern and Southern, Military and Political,  Social and Economic.<br />Beginning in December, 1862, this volume takes us through the siege of Vicksburg, the battles of Gettysburg and those around Atlanta, the March to the Sea and the destruction of the Army of Northern Virginia and the dissolution of the Confederacy.  Each theatre of the War is covered in its turn.  The campaigns are described, not only as battles but as the wars of supply, command staffing and maneuver.  The gradually increasing role of U.S. Grant is apparent as the book progresses.<br />The war is shown, not only as a military contest, but as a political struggle as well.  Abraham Lincoln is seen in his struggles against Copperheads, such as Clement Vallandingham.  The pressure from the Radical Republicans forced Lincoln had to balance the need to advance the rights of blacks while maintaining the support of Unionists who were not willing to accompany Emancipation with political enfranchisement.  The contending forces within Lincoln's cabinet as well as those in Congress and in the states are carefully studied.<br />Jefferson Davis' vain efforts find the right combination of generals and to rally his countrymen in support of the war merits our sympathy. The twin challenges of despair and desertion were beyond even Davis' impressive powers of persuasion.<br />One figure who earned some admiration from me is General George B. MacClellan.  I had always viewed MacClellan as an unsuccessful general and a political opportunist.  Through this trilogy I came to see MacClellan as, a poor general, to be sure, but a politician who adhered to a consistent platform of support for the war and Union, but without any support for emancipation or equality for blacks.<br />One figure who did not improve his standing in my estimation was General Ben Butler, the Massachusetts Pro-War Democrat whose combination of military incompetence and arrogance was tolerated only so long as it was outweighed by his political usefulness.  Once Lincoln was reelected, Butler was given a well earned ticket home.<br />Throughout this book, as in the first two volumes, we see Union Wars aims gradually shift from that of Union, regardless of Emancipation, to Union with Emancipation.  Catton skillfully weaves the story of the inexorable shift in Northern opinion on the subject of Emancipation which forced this shift in war aims.<br />At the end of the book we see the wrap-up of the War and a hint at the challenges of Reconstruction and healing, the effects of which we still struggle with today.<br />At the end of this book I have a much deeper understanding of the Civil War than I had when I started the trilogy.

To many Americans, Washington is largely an unknown quantity, an immovable face on the one dollar bill, known as a Revolutionary War General and First President, but not as a human being.  This book shows Washington, hero and failure, surveyor and farmer, soldier and statesman, body and soul.<br />Son of a minor aristocrat, Washington, unaware that his social standing precluded his advancement beyond the colonial militia, sought positions in the British Navy and Army.  A Virginia militiaman, he stumbled into the world's consciousness in 1753 in a minor skirmish with a French party in the area that is now Pittsburgh.  In a rematch the next year, the question arose as to whether Washington had fought a French military force or murdered an ambassador.  Washington was chastised in battle with the French in 1754, but not before he had created a stir in the chanceries of Europe.  Accompanying Gen. Braddock into the wilderness in 1754-5, Washington's failure to convince Braddock that the French-Canadians did not fight like the Continental French had fatal consequences for Braddock.  Succeeding to command, Washington extricated the army, thereby becoming the hero of a tragic engagement.  This made Washington a military hero in colonial eyes.<br />Having returned to Virginia, we see Washington, the colonial businessman, managing his plantation.  The author gives us an insight into the business of a Virginia planter of Washington's day, a business which involved speculation in western lands as well as the production of tidewater crops.  We see Washington, initially, a grower of tobacco and later of wheat and corn,  the change made because  tobacco tended to wear out the soil and kept the planter is a position of subservience to the British factor who sold his crop and, in return, sold the planter European manufactured goods, all at prices set by the factor.<br />The coming of the Independence movement found Washington a delegate to the Continental Congress.  Flexner reports the forces within Congress which lead to Washington's appointment as Army Commander.<br />The section on the Revolution is informative while moving at a good pace.  The personalities, battles and overall movements of the course of the conflict become clear.  Here we meet Marquis de Layfayette, Lighthorse Harry Lee, and Alexander Hamilton and feel the betrayal of Benedict Arnold.<br />The intervention of the French forces, without which the Revolution would have failed, is skillfully documented.  The relationships between the French and the Americans in general and Washington in particular are explored.<br />Two years after victory at Yorktown we are present at Washington's emotional farewell to his army during which he observed that he had grown \\"gray and nearly blind in the service of my country.\\"  Washington's long-awaited return to Mount Vernon would be merely temporary.<br />Washington's time at Mount Vernon between 1783 and 1789 were enjoyable years during which he played the roles of planter, canal promoter and host to all who passed by Mount Vernon.<br />Washington's domestic bliss would end as the need for a new form of government to replace the Articles of Confederation became obvious.  Summoned to preside at the Constitutional Convention, Washington understood and carried out the role of the \\"Indispensable Man\\", the man without whom his country could not survive.  Washington had become a symbol, a presence which made things happen.  His availability made a single executive possible.<br />Throughout his presidency, Washington was more important for what he was, rather than for what he did.  Washington, the symbol, was not the substance of his administration. The substance was Alexander Hamilton and, to a lesser extent, Thomas Jefferson and others.<br />The first term was largely devoted to setting the precedents for his successors.  Washington had to set the standard on a variety of issues.  The form of address for the president, the extent  and form of senatorial \\"advice and consent\\", the role of the heads of the executive departments and many other precedents had to be established by trial.  The main accomplishments of the first administration were the establishment of the financial underpinnings for the national government and the location of the national capitol.  Foreshadowing future problems was the beginning of the break between Hamilton and Jefferson,  resulting in the split between Jefferson and Washington.<br />Washington's desire to retire after one term was frustrated by the fact that he, again, was indispensable to the harmonious continuation of the national government.  The second term was to be a disappointing one for Washington as his prestige was no longer sufficient to preserve himself from attack.  The return of Jefferson to Monticello made administration totally Hamiltonian.  What soon would become partisan politics crept into public affairs.  The Whiskey Rebellion would be suppressed in a way which would seem to be an attack on societies allied with Jefferson.  Disputes over the treaties with France and England split along the Hamiltonian/Jeffersonian fault lines.  Relations with Revolutionary France would prove to be a contentious issue, bringing even Jefferson under suspicion of possible treason.  By the end of his second term, Washington was determined to retire from public life permanently.<br />Washington's long awaited retirement to Mount Vernon lasted only two years.  At the time of his return, Mount Vernon was showing the signs of the master's absence during the years of national service.  The ground was badly eroded, crop yields were low and the plantation was over staffed with slaves.  Washington's decision to neither buy nor sell slaves had left Mount Vernon with more labor than it could profitably employ.  Upon Martha's death, the slaves owned by Washington were freed.<br />At the end of this book the reader is left with an acquaintance with Washington the entrepreneur, soldier, statesman, colonial and national aristocrat, as well as Washington the man.

Constellation is a fine introduction to the history of this treasured relic of our early Navy.  I read this book in preparation for a visit to the Constellation in Baltimores Inner Harbor where, today, it greets visitors.<br />A precursor to todays weapons of retaliation against Islamic terrorists, Constellation was built in 1797 as part of a fleet intended to respond to the attacks of the Barbary Pirates.  A smaller member of the fleet which included the U. S. S. Constitution (Old Ironsides), the Constellation boasts an impressive history spanning over two centuries.  After exerting American power against the Barbary States, it served honorably in the War of 1812.  Thereafter it alternated between the reserve fleet and active service on a variety of missions.  After sitting out the Mexican War, the Yankee Racehorse served in the Civil War, initially protecting American shipping in the Mediterranean and later as part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron.<br />After the Civil War, Constellation served as a naval training vessel for most of the remainder of the 19th Century.<br />After its centennial, Constellations historical value began to be recognized and she commenced her career as an historical exhibit in Baltimore harbor.<br />During World War II, Constellation performed its final active duty, serving as Flagship of the Commander-In-Chief, Atlantic Fleet.<br />Besides telling the story of a ship, this book also highlights the trials and triumphs of our early Navy.  Disbanded after the Revolution, later debates focused on the issue of whether or not the U. S. should have a Navy. A peace agreement reached with the Barbary States almost forced cancellation of the construction project.  Only the recognition of other necessary missions permitted the construction to go forward and the proud tradition of the U. S. Navy to begin.  Over its life, Constellation would return its investment many times over.<br />I heartily recommend U. S. F.

His statement of facts is magnificent.  Beginning with his immigrant grandfather, Judge Arthur MacArthur, and continuing through the career of his father, Gen. Arthur MacArthur, (see my Amazon review of \\"The General's General\\"), Douglas sets the stage for his entry into the great play of life.  Growing up in the frontier army, Douglas was admitted to West Point in 1899.<br />Not a typical cadet or young officer, Douglas made his first appearance before a Congressional committee investigating hazing at the Academy in 1900.  Graduating in 1903, his first assignment was to the Philippines, the land in which his father had won fame and where he would spend so much of his military career.  In 1906 he was appointed aide-de-camp to President Theodore Roosevelt.<br />With U. S. entry into World War I,  MacArthur bucked the prevailing wisdom that National Guard units could not function effectively in combat.  It was he who conceived, promoted and implemented the concept of the Rainbow Division, consisting of National Guard units from 26 states.  During his command of the Rainbow he established the legend of his fearlessness in combat.<br />Returning to the peace time army, MacArthur rose to Chief of Staff, a position from which, he believed, his father had been barred by political enemies.  During his tenure, Douglas presided over the dispersal of the Bonus Marchers, an action which he staunchly defends in this book, and the defense the Army from the Depression-era budget cutting knife.  During one meeting with FDR, MacArthur erupted with an immediately regretted remark that has become part of the MacArthur legend, \\"to the general effect that when we lost the next war, and an American boy, lying in the mud with an enemy bayonet through his belly and an enemy foot on his dying throat, spat out his last curse, I wanted the name not to be MacArthur, but Roosevelt.\\"  Although he claims to have immediately regretted the remark, he did find it worth reporting.<br />His career in the U.S. Army seemingly concluded, MacArthur retired in 1935 to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army.  In this position he built the Philippine Defenses in the years leading up to World War II.  In his soon to be familiar role of advocate for Pacific defense against a Eurocentered defense establishment, he struggled to obtain funding necessary to prepare the Philippines for the anticipated Japanese onslaught.  When the pre-war build up began it was too little, too late.<br />With the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, MacArthur relates the plans for defense which culminated in the heroic stands on Bataan and Corregidor.  From this narrative we realize how serious was the defenders' expectation of a relief expedition before their surrender.<br />The brilliant campaigns in New Guinea and the Philippines are explained.  Through this campaign, MacArthur shrewdly advanced his forces as rapidly as his advancing air cover would permit, isolating Japanese troops which would be starved of supplies rather than overrun by assault.  By use of this technique, MacArthur conquered immense territory and neutralized massive concentrations of enemy troops while taking relatively few casualties.  On the pages of this book, MacArthur takes us into the conferences in which the plans for the war in the Pacific were charted.<br />With Victory over Japan, MacArthur assumed the role of ruler of Japan.  During the section of the book dealing with this portion of his life, we see the challenges which he confronted and the steps which reformed Japan into the nation which it is today.<br />The chapter \\"Frustration in Korea\\" signals a decided shift in the mood of the book.  Here we read of the desperate state of defense during the early stages of the North Korean invasion, followed by the complete U.N. victory over North Korea after the landingsat Inchon.  With the Red Chinese invasion of Korea, the second retreat began.  Again MacArthur masterminded the U.N. defense.  Here criticism of the Truman Administration accelerates in the accounts leading up to and following MacArthur's dismissal from command.<br />In the final section, MacArthur shares with us his views of developments in America and the world.  We hear of his shock at the substitution of prolonged indecision for victory as a national war goal.  More than once we are reminded that \\"There is no substitute for victory.\\"  In digressions, we also learn his views on the employment of Nationalist Chinese Forces during the Korean War, as well as his views on relationships with Communism, the importance of freedom, the role of the income tax and other issues.  His arguments leave us with the lingering thought that perhaps Red China would have been vulnerable to a determined defense in Korea, bombings and blockade of the mainland and an unleashing of the Nationalist Forces.  It is one of the great \\"What ifs\\" of history.  Near the end of the book we are treated to the transcripts of his address to congress and the final roll call at West Point.<br />Throughout this book we are reminded of the many honors and tributes received by the author.  This book would be much shorter if the awards, congratulatory telegrams, decorations and testimonials were omitted.  The author was certainly impressed with the esteem in which he was held by his fellow man.<br />While not as good of a biography of Douglas MacArthur as \\"American Caesar\\" (see my Amazon review), \\"Reminiscences\\" is a valuable window into MacArthur's world.  Self adulation notwithstanding, this book gives us an insight into how Douglas MacArthur saw his role in the world.  We see many of the powerfully charged issues of the World War II and Korean War eras forcefully promoted by one of their foremost partisans.  I am glad that I read it.

The fact that there is a story of Matt Talbot is a story in itself. Matt lived such an obscure life from 1856-1925 that no picture of him exists. It was only after his death that people began to collect memories of him and his sanctity began to be recognized. Talbot's problems began at the age of twelve when he tried to help his family by getting a job with a wine merchant. The sampling of the wine led to a sixteen year slavery to alcohol. In 1884, aware of what dirnk was doing to himself and his mother, Matt took the pledge to refrain from drink. He kept his pledge for the rest of his life. As he freed himself from alcoholism, Matt found, in Jesus and His Mother, someone in whose service he could gladly enslave himself. Most of the book contains memories related by those who knew Matt which display the degree of his dedication to religious devotion. In this book, Sister Susan Helen Wallace, FSP, has pemitted adults to enjoy her gift for religious biography which she had previously reserved for children	2002-07-16

Covering the period from the summer of 1861 through the fall of 1862, Catton leads the reader through the military, political and social aspects of the war.<br />Here we meet Charles Francis Adams, American Ambassador in London as he maneuvers to maintain British neutrality while British cloth industry manufacturers and laborers scream for Southern cotton.<br />The story of the Eastern front in this book is essentially the story of the McClellan era.  The close relationship between McClellan and the Army of the Potomac was a unique and mutual exchange of devotion and affection.<br />In the Western theatre, the reader studies the battles of Shiloh and others which led to the gradual deterioration of the Confederate position in the Western states.<br />One enticing feature about Catton's books is his talent for weaving the political aspects of the war into the story.  In this book we see the gradual shift of Union War aims from that of preservation of the Union to preservation with Emancipation.<br />The investigation of McClellan's role is fascinating.  I always knew that McClellan was the Democratic nominee for President in 1864.  Catton relates how McClellan was a conservative Democrat even before the war.  Catton portrays McClellan as leader of the opposition to the administration with the army of the Potomac as his instrument of power.  The relationship between the Army and its general forced decisions regarding McClellan's tenure to be made against the back drop of the possibility that McClellan could lead his Army on Washington in an effort to seize control of the government during the prevailing unrest.  Ultimately, the decline of the Conservative Democrats, whose goal was the preservation of both the Union and slavery, and the rise of the Pro-Emancipation forces combined to drive McClellan from command and made his removal possible.<br />This portrayal of McClellan as a leader of the opposition makes Lincoln's toleration of him contrast with President Polk's active efforts to prevent Whig generals, Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott, from capturing Mexican War glory which could lead to political success.  The later role of Gen. MacArthur as a defacto opposition leader during the Korean war also comes to mind (see my Amazon review of \\"American Caesar\\").<br />\\"The Terrible Swift Sword\\" continues the evolution of the war from a limited conflict in which the hope of reconciliation still burned, to an unavoidable, all consuming, fight to the death.  The cause which brought about this change was the shift of war aims from mere preservation of the Union, which had a chance of success, to the aim of Emancipation.  As the South could not accept Emancipation, the North became unable to accept anything less.  This book is a worthy successor to \\"The Coming Fury\\" (see my Amazon review).

Beginning with a brief section on the region from Revolutionary times, the book quickly moves on to the Civil War era which gave birth to West Virginia statehood.<br />The Unionist sentiment in the Western part of Virginia resulted, in 1863, in the only case of succession of a portion of one state from another in American history.  The Civil War in West Virginia is portrayed both in its military and political aspects.<br />Williams tells the story of the evolution of West Virginia from the political, economic and social perspectives.  The fabled Hatfield-MCcoy feud is given ample attention, as is the Hatfield who served his state as governor and United States Senator.<br />In a state with an undistinguished political history, Williams introduces the reader to a series of governors, senators and political bosses who struggled with absentee landowners, rail and coal concerns and labor leaders to lead West Virginia through the 19th and 20th centuries.<br />The story of West Virginia is a story of hope and despair, promise and danger, fulfillment and disappointment.  Through it all Williams presents its story as a drama, partly heroic and partly tragic.  Not a partisan Mountaineer booster, Williams tells the good with the bad.  For anyone wishing to know the history of our country, state by state, this book fills in one piece of the American mosaic in a most pleasant fashion.	2002-07-06

This book gives a good history of the island and the troops who recaptured it in 1945.<br />The book begins with the story of the conquest of the Philippines by American Forces in 1898 during the Spanish American War.  It then continues with the military fortifications of the island during the American Administration.  The Japanese conquest of the Philippines culminating in the Fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942 set the stage for the American reconquest.<br />Flanagan does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the assault forces, the 503d Parachute Regimental Combat Team and the 3rd Battalion Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Division.  We become familiar with the preparations of the 503d in the U. S., Australia and in its jumps at Nadzab in New Guinea and onto Noemfoor Island.<br />With the invasion of the Philippines proceeding successfully the hour for the redemption of American honor at Corregidor arrived.  The small available drop zones on the island made the airborne assault most unlikely and, therefore, a total surprise to the Japanese defenders.  Flanagan takes the reader through the challenges met by the assault force, the means of attack by air, sea and land, the Japanese resistance and the descriptions of the ambient conditions which add to the hellish atmosphere of war.  The fanatical Japanese resistance captures our amazement while the cave by cave extermination of the enemy brings to mind contemporary reports form Afghanistan.<br />The emotional climax of the book is Gen. MacArthur's triumphant return to Corregidor, by PT boat, just as he left three years before,  during which he orders:  \\"I see the old flag pole still stands.  Have your troops hoist the colors to its peak and let no emery ever haul them down.\\"<br />\\"Corregidor\\" is an excellent choice for anyone with an interest in the details of combat or the history of the War in the Philippines.details of combat or the history of the War in the Philippines.	2002-06-15

Stokesbury adequately covers all aspects of the war, including political, military, naval, air and the peace negotiations.<br />The Korean war is portrayed as one into which both sides, essentially, blundered.  Numerous American officials had sent the message that Korea lay outside the United States' Asian perimeter of defense.  In response to these signals, the Communists took what they thought was an easy pick and were surprised when the U.S. did respond militarily to the invasion.<br />The pre-war situation in South Korea under the Rhee administration is amply covered.  One reason that South Korea was so ill-prepared to respond to the invasion was that the U.S. had deliberately limited the Republic of Korea (ROK) forces because of a fear that President Rhee would launch his own invasion of the North if the ROK was strong enough to do so.<br />The initial North Korean invasion lead to a rout of South Korean defenders and, initially, the Americans sent to their aid.  Ultimately, the build-up of United Nations' Forces, the bombardment of Communist forces by U.N. air power and the limitations of the North Korean supply system saved the U.N. forces from being driven into the sea.  The weakness in the Communist supply system was an inability to maintain the supply of  the troops once an offensive was begun.  When a Communist offensive exhausted its stored supplies it tended to run out of steam.  This was the situation at the time of the Inchon landing which lead to the collapse of the North Korean invasion and the U.N. advance to the Yalu.<br />At this point the U.N. was at a critical juncture.  Despite Chinese warnings, the U.N. continued its drive to unite Korea all the way to the Yalu.  The unanswered question remains as to whether a more modest advance which occupied some of North Korea, while allowing a remnant North Korea to remain as a buffer between South Korea and China would have permitted the war to have ended much sooner and on terms more satisfactory to the U.N.<br />Restraint was not the rule of the day and the Chinese did enter the war and, again, threatened to drive the U.N. into the sea.  Again, it was U.N. determination and air power which stemmed the tide and  allowed the war to degenerate into a stalemate which lead to the commencement of peace talks.  Unfortunately, the talks were to drag on for two years while men froze, and bled and died over No Name hills.<br />Eventually the peace talks became bogged down over the issue of repatriation of POWs.  The problem  was that many of the Communist POWs did not want to be repatriated to North Korea or Red China.  Many, ultimately, were repatriated to South Korea or Nationalist China.<br />Stokesbury gives the reader an introduction to the role of air and naval power as well as the contributions of other U.N. members.  The truth is that about two-thirds of U.N. members contributed to the war effort in some way or another.  The political problems arising out of this international effort are also explored.<br />At the end of this book I felt that I had a good, general understanding of the Korean War and a whetted appetite to read more.ain as a buffer between South Korea and China would have permitted the war to have ended much sooner and on terms more satisfactory to the U.N. <br />Restraint was not the rule of the day and the Chinese did enter the war and, again, threatened to drive the U.N. into the sea.

I recently reread \\"The Confessions of St. Augustine\\" after many years and am glad that I did. This book, which is often called the first autobiography, is really not an autobiography in the sense that we use the term. It is Augustine's Confession to God, from which we glean many details about Augustine's life.<br />In this we learn of Augustine's family, his early life, his search for truth and, throughout the book, his teachings on theology. Here we see him move to the gradually larger world, from Tagaste, to Carthage, to Rome, to Milan, where he finally finds Truth. He is then ready to return to his native Africa, his preparation completed for the work which would make him one of the greatest, Christian theologians of all time.<br />In much of the early book, Augustine tells us of his rejections of God's call. Seeking truth and honors, he searched through many sources and sought out many teachers. He sought wisdom from pagan and Manichean philosophers. His disappointment with the highly touted Manichean bishop, Faustus, whose speech was pleasing but whose answers failed to soothe Augustine's soul, caused him to turn to Catholicism.<br />Learning from the respected bishop, Ambrose, Augustine came to recognize the truth of Christianity, but his slavery to a non-Christian life style long prevented him from following the call of God. This persisted until one day he heard the child's song \\"Tolle Lege, Tolle, Lege\\" (the title of my high school newspaper), \\"Take it and read.\\" Taking this as a divine command to read the first passage of scripture to meet his eyes, he opened the book to the passage, \\"Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying: but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in concupiscence.\\" Needing to read no further, his conversion occurred and he was ready for the great work which lay before him.<br />Throughout much of the book, we are treated to Augustine's teachings on a variety of religious topics. We obtain his guidance on the nature of God, God's relationship with and expectations of man, as well as norms for the interpretation of scripture.

No, I  am not related to David Gallen.  Roger Goldman, however, did teach me constitutional law at St. Louis University during Justice Brennan's service on the Supreme Court.<br />Justice Brennan was one of the longest serving justices on the Supreme Court, serving from his appointment by President Eisenhower in 1956 until his retirement in 1990.  A member of the New Jersey Supreme Court before his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brennan became one of the court's consistently liberal justices during his 34 year tenure.<br />This book is in no way a biography of William J. Brennan, Jr., although some biographical details do work themselves into the narrative.  This book is an exposition of the judicial legacy of this very important justice of the twentieth century.<br />This book is organized into three sections.  The first section contains tributes to Brennan from others who have known him, primarily his former clerks.  Section II contains a summary of the judicial positions which Brennan championed in his opinions.  Section III contains a collection of Brennan's most important opinions.<br />This book is a worthwhile read, whether you are a fan of Justice Brennan or whether you see him as an activist justice run amuck.  His fans will revel in his judicial literature.  Strict constructionists will find justification for criticism of his kind in the pages of this book.  All will notice his shift from an intellectual mainstay of the liberal Warren Court, to a sometime dissenter and sometime majority builder on the Burger Court to his role as a frequent dissenter on the Rehnquist Court, who still packed the punch necessary to bring an occasional majority to his thinking.  When he failed to persuade the majority he left his dissents for liberals who he knew would follow later.<br />Read and enjoy.	2002-05-25

The true story, which we read in this book, is much more than that.<br />The \\"American Revolution\\" provides an interesting survey of the military aspects of our War for Independence.  The background political factors which lead to the Declaration of Independence, both American and British, are presented, but once the Continental Army is established the book tends to focus primarily on military matters.  One of the things I like about is book is that it gives thorough coverage to American, British and French personalities and initiatives in the war.<br />Another thing which I like about this work is its ability to impart an understanding of the outline of the War, both chronologically and geographically.  The main events and characters are revealed both in their successes as well as in their flaws.  While illustrating his greatness,  errors committed by Washington are not overlooked.<br />This book places the pieces of the story which we have often heard into their proper places in the puzzle. All of it, from the early British evacuation of Boston through the Northern campaigns to the shift of action to the Southern theatres to the final evacuation of New York, now seems to make sense.  The campaign of George Rogers Clark which won the West (now Midwest) for the new republic is also given fair coverage.<br />This book makes clear that, not withstanding the immense sacrifice of the Americans, victory was possible only because of the intervention of the French army and fleet.<br />We are repeatedly reminded that American sentiment was not totally in support of the war.  military actions by Tories in support of the Crown, although largely ineffective, are given adequate attention throughout the narrative.<br />All in all, I enjoyed this interesting introduction to this crucial, but all too little known war.	2002-05-17

It is the story of how Reagan's leadership confounded his critics and enabled Reagan, without brilliance or yeoman work effort, to become one of the most successful presidents in U.S. history.<br />Unlike some of his former aides who belittle Reagan, D'Souza provides a balanced assessment of Reagan's strengths and weaknesses.  In the early part of the book , D'Souza illustrates Reagan's limitations thereby establishing his credentials as an ordinary man.<br />D'Souza explains Reagan's style of leadership, which basically involves establishing a general policy and then entrusting its execution to subordinates.  D'Souza illustrates, by example, Reagan's leadership style through his handling of a series of crises with which he was confronted during his career.  One by one, D'Souza takes us through the backgrounds of the tax cut, deployment of missiles in Europe, Bittberg, and many others.  In this presentation of the Iran-Contra scandal Reagan is presented as thoroughly involved in the plan to trade arms for hostages, but unaware of the diversion of the proceeds to the Contras.<br />D'Souza does not explore exclusively Reagan's public leadership.  He also focuses on Reagan's personal relationships as well.  He portrays Reagan as one who, while publicly promoting family values, was unable to live them in his own family.  Reagan, who was every American's friend, had few real friends of his own.  Many of his aides were disappointed to find themselves unable to establish a personal relationships with Reagan who then discarded them when their usefulness to him was exhausted.<br />By the conclusion of the book, we are left with a perception of Reagan much different than that prevailing among the public.  The kindly, simpleminded grandfather is replaced by a much different person.  Rather than kindly, Reagan is seen as a very private person, unable to establish, except with Nancy, a personal relationship with anyone.  The undistinguished scholar is shown to confound and outwit the wise men time after time.  Much of Reagan's strength is found in his unchanging firm adherence to his faith in God, freedom and the American people.  D'Souza's Reagan has a much weaker claim on our affections, but is much more deserving of our respect than the Reagan of many other evaluators.<br />This is one of those excellent books which causes us to change our impression of its subject.  I admire its craft and appreciate its teaching.a perception of Reagan much different than that prevailing among the public.

The undistinguished scholar is shown to confound and outwit the wise men time after time.  Much of Reagan's strength is found in his unchanging firm adherence to his faith in God, freedom and the American people.  D'Souza's Reagan has a much weaker claim on our affections, but is much more deserving of our respect than the Reagan of many other evaluators.  <br />This is one of those excellent books which causes us to change our impression of its subject.  I admire its craft and appreciate its teaching.	2002-04-30

In its pages, we art treated to a glimpse into the life of early St. Louis, seen through the eyes of Hugh O'Rome, scion of an 18th century Franco-Irish marriage, so common in the Mississippi Valley of that day.  Beginning in the era of the founding of St. Louis in 1764 and continuing to the Battle of New Orleans, we see the development and transformation of a land, a city and a region.<br />We are introduced to an interesting cast of characters, both historical and fictional.  Probably the greatest development of an historical character is that of Fr. Pierre Gibault, the Patriot Priest of Mid-America, who guided his Francophone flock into the American Revolution.  Here we meet George Rogers Clark, the Virginia adventurer whose daring expeditions won the heart of a continent for the U.S.  Of local interest, we meet Pierre Chouteau, founder of St. Louis.  The nations playing roles in the drama are represented by the Indian Chief Pontiac, French Commander St. Ange and the Spanish Commandant, De Leyba.<br />All of these characters are skillfully woven into the life story of Hugh O'Rome.  Fr. Faherty uses O'Rome's life story to teach us a bit of history along the way.  O'Rome is the son of an Irishman and his local French-Canadian wife, a common domestic arrangement of the time and place.<br />It is explained that the name \\"O'Rome\\" had been adopted in Ireland in an effort to trade an obviously Irish name for one more acceptable to the British overlords.  Perhaps that is how my mother's family acquired the name of English.<br />Through the lives of three O'Romes, we see the resentment of the British Empire among the Irish and French, as well as the gradual incorporation of our region into the American Commonwealth.  With these three generations of the O'Rome family we live through love and hatred, victory and defeat, moral crises and spiritual blessing.  We meet a family whose goals and beliefs are not all that different from our own.<br />Perhaps test of greatness in literature is whether or not the work leaves us with a thought which has changed our world view.  For me, \\"Wide River Wide Land\\" meets that test.  In the St. Louis region today, the Mississippi River is often seen as the wide river which separates Illinois and Missouri.  Since my first reading of this book, I have often thought of it, as Hugh O'Rome saw it, as the Wide River which unites the Wide Land.  So may it forever be.l that different from our own.<br />Perhaps test of greatness in literature is whether or not the work leaves us with a thought which has changed our world view.

As such it is a very interesting and timely book.  This book tells the story of America's first incursion into the morass of the ongoing conflict between Christendom and Islam.  As such, it provides an interesting backdrop to the current war on terrorism.<br />In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Barbary states of North African pursued a state policy of attacking Christian shipping for the purpose of taking prizes as well as prisoners who could be released for ransom or sold into slavery.  The traditional response to this practice by the great European powers was the payment of annual tribute to the states in order to purchase immunity from seizure for their merchantmen.  Ironically, it was the Unites States, a new nation brimming with little more than enthusiasm, which chose Mar's response to this challenge.<br />The bellicose response of the U.S. can be most clearly attributed to Thomas Jefferson.  As consul in France, Jefferson had lobbied for a military response to the Barbary pirates.  As President, he had the opportunity to make his wishes policy.  One necessary step to implement this policy was for the U.S. to build a Navy, the cost of which made the proposal very controversial.  Two of the vessels built for the expedition, the Constitution of Boston and the Constellation of Baltimore, remain on public display in the harbors in which they were built.  Others, such as the Nautilus and Enterprise, were part of a long line of traditional naval names which have continued to recent times.<br />With fleets built and assembled, the Mediterranean squadron set sail for duty.  Remaining in the Mediterranean for several years, the fleet had an inconsistent history of waiting and striking, success and failure.  Several changes of commander were necessary before the right combination of men and ships was achieved in order to make decisive action possible.  Throughout the process, U.S. actions were hampered by the delay in communications between Washington and the front.<br />Through a combination of diplomatic pressure, naval attack and land based assaults involving U.S. Marines and local insurgents, the U.S. succeeded in extracting the release of American prisoners and treaties of peace between the U.S. and the Barbary States.<br />This story does give an insight into several themes of history.  The problems resulting from decisions made in Washington being based on stale information reminds us of the power and responsibility of theatre commanders in eras in which direction from the political powers took months to transmit.  There was no micro management from Washington in this war!<br />A study of the Tripolitan Wars may provide insights into similarities to contemporary policy challenges.  In Jefferson's day, as well as in Bush's, it was the United States, not European powers, which determined to rid the world of evil through force, rather than to work out an accommodation with it.  Jefferson, as Bush, used combined forces of American and local origin.  The resolution of the Tripolitan Wars, as in the case of Desert Storm, achieved the immediate objectives, but left the primary Evil Enemies in power.  The Evil Persons of the Barbary Coast, as the Evil Persons of the Gulf, would return to make mischief after the U.S. forces had left the theatre.<br />\\"To the Shores of Tripoli\\" demonstrates that for over two centuries of U.S. history the U.S. has remained a country guided by its principles.  Whereas other nations often chose pragmatism over principle, the United States, whether led by a Jefferson, a Bush, or any of those in between, remains a nation rooted in its beliefs and its ideals.  Whether virtually impotent, ass in the times of the Tripolitan Wars,  or powerful, as today, the U.S. has always drawn strength form its ideals.  This is the spirit which enabled America to rally to Wilson's call to make the world safe for democracy, or to respond to Roosevelt's call to make America the Arsenal of Democracy. From the Shores of Tripoli to the deserts of Afghanistan, it has been the U.S., if anyone, who has lead the forces of good versus evil.

It boldly tells the story of one of the Twentieth Centuries' towering personalities, while skillfully weaving in the history of the world in which MacArthur acted.<br />Manchester begins by quoting Arnold Toynbee to give the reader an insight into his view of MacArthur as the American Caesar.<br />\\"Caesar was not and is not lovable. His generosity to defeated opponents, magnanimous though it was, did not win their affection. He won his soldiers' devotion by the victories that his intellectual ability, applied to warfare, brought them. Yet, though not lovable, Caesar was and is attractive, indeed fascinating. His political achievement required ability, in effect amounting to genius, in several different fields, including administration and general ship, besides the minor arts of wire pulling and propaganda. In all these, Caesar was a supreme virtuoso.\\"<br />Neither a paean nor an indictment, Manchester provides a balance account of this most controversial character, recording his accomplishments and failures, his strengths and weaknesses.<br />The book begins with an explanation of the rich heritage to which MacArthur was born heir. His grandfather was a well known Wisconsin politician and judge. His father, General Arthur MacArthur, (see may Amazon review of \\"The General's General\\") was the greatest man Douglas would admit to knowing.<br />The similarities between father and son are striking. Both were among the leading army officers of their times. Together, they form one of only two father-son teams to win the Medal of Honor. Each would achieve prominence through victorious campaigns in the Philippines. Each would exercise political power as a governor in the Orient, Arthur as military governor of the Philippines and Douglas as ruler of Japan. Each would fall from power in struggles against political superiors and each would end his life alienated from the army they loved, while being poster boys for the political opposition.<br />These similarities are not merely independent coincidences. Arthur's involvement in the Orient brought Douglas to the theatre as a young aide, during which service he claimed to have learned to understand the Oriental mind. For half a century, American military activity in the Far East would be the particular bailiwick of the Clan MacArthur.<br />Douglas first saw combat as Brigadier General of the Rainbow division in World War I. It was here that he first demonstrated his fearless, almost foolhardy tempting of fate which would draw attention to himself.<br />During the interwar period, Douglas served in the position of Army Chief of Staff, a position from which, he believed, his father had been excluded by political enemies. It was during this service that Douglas worked in the Hoover administration, one with which his was politically sympathetic.<br />His service as Chief of Staff completed, Douglas retired from the U.S. Army and served as Field Marshall of the Philippine army. In reading about this part of his career that I learned some surprising facts. I had always thought that the Philippines were viewed as American territory to be vigorously defended as America's Western shield in the Pacific. In truth, MacArthur contended with serious political debates as to whether the Philippines should be defended at all. When the War Department did decide to transfer forces to the Philippines, it was the proverbial, too little, too late.<br />MacArthur's response to the Japanese attacks on the Philippines was, perhaps, the most militarily embarrassing part of his career.<br />With the evacuation to Australia, MacArthur began the offensive which would roll back the Japanese Empire in the Southwest Pacific. In reporting on this offensive, Manchester explains the brilliant campaign while including incidents which illustrate MacArthur's personal vanity.<br />With the Victory over Japan, MacArthur assumed the position of ruler of Japan. In this position, MacArthur effected profound change in Japanese society and political structure. As I was reading this book, the thought arose as to how the political power for change wielded by MacArthur as ruler of Japan compared to the power that Eisenhower exerted as President of the U.S. The results of MacArthur's tenure were so great as to make the question, at least, worth asking.<br />MacArthur's focus shifted from the refashioning of Japanese society to the defense of Freedom in Korea with the North Korean attack on South Korea on June 24, 1950. In this segment we see Mac Arthur's frustration over policy differences with Washington. Throughout this segment of MacArthur's career, Manchester maintains a moderately pro-MacArthur tone, seemingly believing that MacArthur's opinions were correct, but that his insubordination made his removal inevitable, although badly handled. The Truman administration comes across as a band of bunglers. The history of the early part of the Korean War is skillfully woven into this biography.<br />MacArthur's return to the United States is shown as a triumphant tour managed by Republican leaders, prominently Herbert Hoover. MacArthur immediately became a leading spokesman for the Anti-Truman crowd. While he played a role in Truman's unpopularity and resulting decision not to seek a third term, the General was unable to generate a Presidential boom for himself. His last bid for power took form in his support of Sen. Robert A. Taft in 1952. Speculation had it that MacArthur would play a prominent role in a Taft administration, either as vice-president or in the cabinet. In light of Taft's death in 1953, this may have been the closest that MacArthur came to the presidency.<br />After 1952 MacArthur finally faded away, only to emerge occasionally to impart advice and wisdom to the Commanders-in-Chief.<br />The hopes with which I began this book were exceeded by the time I had finished. \\"American Caesar\\" is a classic rendering of an heroic life.tion, MacArthur effected profound change in Japanese society and political structure.

Much of the book was an absolute delight, whole other parts were very distasteful.<br />\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is Frank McCourt's story of his life from his first memories in New York, through his childhood and teen years in Limerick until he is able to save enough to return to America on his own.<br />At the start of the book, McCourt says: \\"My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born...Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"  He then writes a first person stream of consciousness narrative to prove his premise.<br />The parts of the book which were absolute delights were the parts in which one is treated to the language of the Irish with all of their peculiar phrases, expectations and beliefs.  While listening to these selections, I was reminded of some of the phases which I have heard from my Irish born relatives.  Some of the beliefs and world views illustrated did not seem so different from some of which I have heard or even held.  There is just enough truth to make the quotations humorous.<br />I am glad that I listened to the audio version which was read by the author.  His Irish accent made the book more entertaining than the written word would have been.  I noticed that the pronunciation was not always the way the book was writen.<br />The oppressive and endless poverty and burden of alcoholism are depressing but, in his as in too many families, real tragedies.<br />The characters are, perhaps, realistic dichotomies.  Malachy, seems to be a good man when sober, but his weakness for the drink renders him an irresponsible father.  Angela, the mother, seems to be a an incompetent personality who, somehow, manages to hold her family together when with little and, eventually, no help from Malachy.  The initial, cold receptions of the McCourts by their families in Ireland ultimately give way to  grudging acceptance and assistance. Frankie, the author and narrator, begins as a naive child who, forced by circumstances, becomes a self sufficient adult.  Perhaps the tragedy of Frankie is that, immersed in a world of hardship and formal religion he learns much about self-sufficiency but little about morality.<br />The parts of the book which I found to be most distasteful were the later sections which degenerated into what would have to qualify the work for an \\"X\\" rating.  Perhaps this is McCourt's ultimate way of proving his premise that the worst childhood is an Irish Catholic childhood.  I suspect that this would have been a better book had the immorality been eliminated from the later sections, but, perhaps, it would not then have conveyed the intended message.<br />This book is enjoyable to read in parts and I am glad to know what it is about, but any endorsement would have to be lukewarm.al, cold receptions of the McCourts by their families in Ireland ultimately give way to  grudging acceptance and assistance.

The title is derived from George Washington's warning against \\"Passionate attachments\\" with foreign nations.  Such attachments result in:<br />\\"Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists...It leads also to concession to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt...to injure the nation making the concessions...by exciting jealousy, ill will, and disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld...It gives to...citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility...to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils.\\"<br />The authors then proceed to explain how the relationship between the United States and Israel violates Washington's warning and proves all his predictions of the consequences of a \\"Passionate attachment.\\"<br />The first section of the book covers the history of the relationship from the foundation of Israel in 1947 to the date of writing in 1992.  The Balls explain how the inordinate influence of Israel began when a politically weak Harry S Truman capitulated to Israeli pressures to ensure Jewish support in the crucial 1948 election.<br />The only President who seems to have earned the respect of the authors is Dwight D. Eisenhower who, unlike Truman, owed no political debt to Jewish voters and who was sufficiently rich in political capital to permit an adherence to a principled policy.<br />Beginning with the Kennedy administration, the Balls indicate that American administrations have repeatedly sacrificed American interests on the altar of Israeli demands.  Among the low points of the relationship was the 1967 attack by Israeli forces on the USS Liberty, a U. S. Navy intelligence ship whose existence threatened Israeli plans to occupy the Golan Heights before international pressure could force a cease-fire.  Rather than responding to this attack on the U.S. Navy as it would if directed from any other quarter, the Johnson administration wrote it off as a case of mistaken identity.  In subsequent administrations the retreat from principle has continued.<br />The authors illustrate how, as the relationship developed, supporters of Israel were able to create the illusion that Israel served as a valuable American asset the Cold War struggle against Soviet expansionism.  The authors explain how the Coalition which won the Gulf War proved that Israel's days as a strategic American asset, if they ever existed, were over.<br />Much attention is devoted to the relationship between Israel and its Arab neighbors.  It is refreshing to read an analysis of the recent history of the Middle East which is not filtered through Israeli apologists.  The authors explain the background of developments in Israel and the Arab portions of Palestine.  The Israeli policy of national expansion of military conquest, the expulsion of Arabs from conquered land and the colonization of those who have remained under the Israeli yoke are explained in detail.  Acts of Israeli terrorism against Arabs are given due attention, despite the record of Israeli denials which are routinely accepted in American circles.<br />An eye-opening chapter is devoted to the strong influence of Jewish pressure on American politics and how it is reflected in American foreign policy toward Israel and the Arabs.<br />Particularly timely chapters are the ones on the neglected American-Arab relations and \\"Terror and Reprisal\\" against America and Israel.  The moral and financial costs of the Passionate attachment are followed by recommendations directed to both the United States and Israel on ways to advance the interests of each in the Middle East.<br />This book is both edifying and shocking.  It is edifying in that it presents a different views of the state of America's role in Middle eastern affairs that that to which we are normally exposed.  This book is shocking in that it shows millions of Americans and several administrations as subordinating American interests to those of Israeli in the determination of American policy.

Thereafter, the body gives an entry of events for every day from January 1, 1861 to May 30, 1865.<br />Each month begins with a summary of the situation as it existed at the beginning of the month and a brief explanation of the trends which played out during the month.  The daily entries follow thereafter.<br />The entries cover the gamut of participants in the war.  Political, military and naval leaders share space with the diaries of enlisted men and civilians.  Author Robert Denney treats us to the opportunity of following the lives of individual diarists throughout the war.  Prominent among them are John S. Jackman of Kentucky's \\"Orphan Brigade\\" which could not return to their Union occupied home state and Lucius Barber of the 15th Illinois Volunteer Infantry.<br />Barber's entries were of particular interest to me as my great-grand-father, Patrick R. Nealon, was also a member of the 15th.  As I read Barber's entries I felt that I was able to get an insight into what Patrick went though during his service.  Although his name was never mentioned, I always wondered if he was involved in any of the reported acts of bravery or mischief.  There were some thing which I was surprised to learn about the service of the 15th.  I did not know that they were only held prisoners for 47 days and that the did return to combat after their parole.  The story of their participation in the Grand Review was another surprise for me.<br />All in all, this is an excellent example of the popular history of the Civil War, which will provide knowledge and enjoyment for any student of the that conflict.	2002-02-06

The lines of division resulted from a multitude of decisions made by the actors in this national tragedy.<br />For many with only a superficial knowledge,  history is the story of conflict between right and wrong, heroes and villains.  When I read history I enjoy books which permit us to see the stories and characters with all their triumphs and failures, virtues and faults.  \\"The Coming Fury\\" ranks high on the list of such books.<br />The first casualty of the failure of compromise was the Great Democracy, the Democratic Party, which split into its Northern and Southern wings in 1860, making the election of Abraham Lincoln inevitable that fall.<br />The election of Lincoln convinced many southerners that the Union was no longer provided a suitable home for them. This book tells the story of how the breakup occurred.<br />We see James Buchanan, trapped by a cabinet which was as divided as the nation, presiding over the rejection of the Constitution and the dissolution of the Union which he was sworn to preserve and protect and who, incredibly, retired in the belief that he had done a good job under the circumstances.<br />We see Abraham Lincoln, whose eloquence and political magic are the stuff of legends, stumble his way into Civil War.  We learn that the speeches along his route from Springfield to Washington contain nothing of the inspiring rhetoric which now adorns his Memorial.<br />We see that the South did secede in one monolithic movement.  The first seven states seceded nearly in masse, while the remaining slave states waited to see whether a compromise would permit the survival of the nation.<br />We all know about the firing on Fort Sumter, but how many know what was really at stake?  The truth is that the main issue was over the possession of forts.  In fact, there were several forts which could have provided the spark which set the nation ablaze, but the honor fell to Sumter and South Carolina.<br />Although the issue of Fort Sumter revolved around the possession of real estate, the implications were much greater.  Several of the Border states swung toward the Confederacy after the attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter.  It can be said that Lincoln's first crucial decision, that being to reinforce Fort Sumter, lead to the secession of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas, with Maryland and Missouri being held in only by military force.  It was Lincoln's political decisions which almost transformed the Confederacy from a rump nation with virtually no chance of survival into state with an excellent prospects.<br />I was interested in the treatment of General Winfield Scott.  I had always thought of him as an old soldier who occupied his chair until he was pushed aside for younger men.  In fact, Scott played a major role in the preservation of the country during the period of transition as well as in the formulation of the battle plan which eventually restored its unity.<br />After the succession of the states, the focus shifts to the preparations for war, both in the north and the south.  In the north, the challenge was to organize the forces with which to subjugate the rebellious states.  In the south, the simultaneous establishment of both government and army was a truly incredible accomplishment.<br />With the early preparations completed, the First Battle of Bull Run tested the expectations of all contestants.  The battle proved the ineptness of both sides.  Bull Run dispelled many notions.  Bothsides now realized that they were in for a long and hard struggle.  Both now realized that the lack of compromise, which had rendered asunder the Democracy in 1860, had rendered any chance of a political resolution null and void.  Bull Run had set the stage for the long and bitter struggle which Catton would report in his subsequent two books.<br />This is a outstanding introduction to our great national tragedy.sides now realized that they were in for a long and hard struggle.

Each entry includes the basic information including a picture and a series of categories of details.  Examples of the categories include a physical description, birth, relatives, romances, education and pre-presidential and post presidential careers.  The sections on the presidency of each individual includes information on the elections including opponents,  popular votes and electoral votes by each candidate by state.  Some details of vice-presidents and cabinets are included as well as the major events of the administration.  The entries usually conclude with quotations of the president, as well as quotations by others praising and criticizing the president.<br />I kept this book in my car for months during which I read it cover to cover.  It can very easily be read over an extended period, because each section stands independently.  I have since kept it on the bookshelf from which I have removed it on many occasions for reference.<br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the U.S. Presidents.	2002-01-05

Ultimately, the successors of these Irish Monks would emigrate to the continent.  By carrying their books to their newly established continental monasteries they restored the basis of classical civilization and thereby enabled the evolution of Medieval Civilization.<br />Cahill devotes much of the early part of the book to describing what was lost.  He does this by focusing on, perhaps, the last classical man, St. Augustine.  He then contrasts the classical civilization of St. Augustine with the barbaric culture of Celtic Ireland.<br />Much of the book is devoted to the lives of two contemporary giants who probably never heard of each other, Sts. Augustine and Patrick.  Whereas Augustine represented a dying culture in need of preservation, Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland, where it took root and, beyond the reach of the Invading Barbarians, was preserved for future generations.<br />For over a century, Christianity survived by clinging to rocks such as Skellig Michael off the Coast of Ireland.  During this time Christianity was reshaped by its Hibernian exile.<br />As interested as I am in Irish History, I found this book to be a bit disappointing.  The extensive writing on St. Augustine and St. Patrick seem, while interesting in themselves, as not contributing particularly to the overall story of the book.<br />This book is largely a collection of stories which get the main idea across with a somewhat discoordinated writing style.<br />Overall, this book is a fair introduction to the Irish contribution to the interim period between the Classical and Medieval Ages.oss with a somewhat discoordinated writing style.<br />Overall, this book is a fair introduction to the Irish contribution to the interim period between the Classical and Medieval Ages.	2002-01-02

Current world events are focusing interest onto Christian-Moslem conflicts of past centuries during which Christendom was on the offensive.  \\"Soldiers of Faith\\" is a timely book which focuses its attention on the Soldiers of Christendom and Islam who fought through the Two Centuries of Crusades.  While not providing a campaign by campaign account of the Crusades, it does provide much background information for the interested reader.  It does provide the reader with a background into historical realities which may, to some extent, explain the origins contemporary news items.<br />Many facets of Crusader life are covered in the book. The social makeup of the Crusader armies, divided between knights and foot soldiers is extensively explored.  The differing sources, uses, and lifestyles of the Crusading Estates are introduced.  The social mix of the Crusading armies came as a surprise to me.  I had thought that Crusading armies, and Medieval armies in general,  consisted primarily of knights.  From this book I learned that the bulk of the armies consisted of infantry drawn from the Common Estate.<br />Much is explained about the rise of the Crusading Spirit it Europe as well as its life and ultimate decline over a two century period.  What lead Europeans to take up the Cross?  A combination of forces came into play.  For some it was the noble desire to reclaim the land of Christ for Christendom.  For others, with less noble motives, the desire to run away from problems at home, obtain indulgences, see the world or avoid taxation were only a few of the factors which lead them to the Holy Land.<br />The conduct of the Soldiers themselves told much of the movement.  In an era antedating the modern, national army, the focus of operations was less predictable.  Although the professed goal of the Crusade was the recovery of the Holy Land, many turned against other Crusaders, Byzantine Christians, heretics and other Christians as well as favoring looting and pillage over the recovery of lost lands.<br />The political and military leaders of the Crusading era are well explored.  Prominent among them are St. Louis IX of France, Richard the Lion Hearted of England and Sulymein.  A series of Popes and other personalities are also discussed.<br />Much attention is directed to the religious actions and objects which were prominent in the era.  The importance and object of pilgrimages throughout Europe and the Holy Land for Christian and Saracen alike are well related.  The abuse which Christians, Moslems and Jews heaped upon each other demonstrated the depth of religious fervor.  The desecration of the sacred by those of other religions is certainly out of step with contemporary civilized discourse, but may be reflected in the actions of some extremists in the contemporary world.  It may be significant that attitudes which are considered extreme today may have been considered laudable in Medieval times.<br />The shifting levels of respect afforded by Christian and Moslems to these other \\"People of the Book\\" give interesting insights into the thought process of Crusader leaders.  Much is made of the practice of Sulymein to treat captured Christian noblemen as honored guests until Christian massacres of Muslims caused him to rethink his notions of hospitality.<br />Near the end of its two century run, the Crusading movement was loosing steam.  The decline of the religious fervor from which it had risen and the rise of rivalry among the emerging nation states of Europe combined to bring down the curtain on the Crusading Movement.<br />The focus of this book is well defined in its title.

During these early years each would be a friend and supporter of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, both because of personal friendship and because of a shared abhorrence of Communism.  Kennedy would later deny that he had once delivered a campaign contribution from his father directly to Nixon's office.  Robert Kennedy, after working on the Stevenson campaign, cast his vote for Eisenhower and Nixon.  Later Joseph P. Kennedy would tell Nixon; \\"Dick, if my boy can't make it, I'm for you!\\"<br />Throughout the 50s, Nixon was the star who was moved to tears at the prospect that Jack was going to die, as he nearly did.<br />The first rivalry began 1956 when Kennedy made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the Democratic vice-presidential nomination which would have pitted him against Nixon.  The rivalry would intensify and destroy their friendship in the following years.<br />As 1960 approached, it became apparent that Nixon and Kennedy would go face to face for the prize coveted by both.  By now the tide had turned.  Now it was Kennedy who appeared healthy and vigorous while Nixon appeared ill and gaunt.  Nixon, who had sought and received Jack's warm cordiality, was now met only with cold disregard and contempt.  On the issues, Kennedy was able to proceed with the reckless abandon of an outsider, while Nixon was chained to an administration which he could not undermine.  While Kennedy and Nixon were both aware of the preparations for the Bay of Pigs, Nixon, while complaining privately about delays in the operation, had to hold his tongue while Kennedy lashed the administration for doing nothing about Castro.  In this campaign that Nixon learned that the Kennedys played hard and had the money to win.<br />With defeat in 1960, Nixon, who had been at the heart of Washington for 14 years, was suddenly out in the cold.  Returning to California, he tried to keep his career alive by running for Governor California.  This was not just a race for governor.  It was a race between Nixon and the President who did not want to face him again.  It was a race which Nixon lost in part, he thought, due to the actions of the Kennedys and their allies in the press.  After the \\"Last Press Conference\\" Nixon appeared to be finished to most, but not to the Kennedys.<br />Throughout his Presidency, Kennedy was plagued by the realization that he, as leader of the party which even he had attacked for \\"Losing China\\", could not afford to lose any territory to the Communists.  This may have influenced the coup against Diem, which lead to so much grief in Vietnam.<br />Over the next year Nixon kept up the pressure on Kennedy with a view to keeping himself on the political playing field.  In November, 1963 John F. Kennedy became the unassailable fallen hero who would forever haunt Richard Nixon.<br />In death, John Kennedy became the hero he could never be in life.  Idolized by millions, he became the President against whom his successors would be measured for the rest of the century.  The memory of a Camelot, an invention of Jacki Kennedy which had never really existed, would influence the political life of America for decades.<br />Emerging as the Republican hero of the Congressional gains in 1966, Nixon geared to face LBJ in 1968.  To his dismay, it then appeared that a Kennedy would again stand between him and the White House until gunfire, again, intervened.  Then the possibility of a Teddy Kennedy candidacy briefly marred Nixon's prospects.  Even with no Kennedy on the ticket, Nixon faced the enmity of those who yearned for a restoration and who regarded Nixon as an illegitimate usurper.<br />Even victory in 1968 could not diminish the specter of JFK.  Whenever Nixon faced a public relations failure, he marveled at what the Kennedys got away with.  Nixon even tried to emulate the Kennedys in ways that he just could never pull off, while the Kennedy crowd continued to treat Nixon with utter contempt.<br />As 1972 approached, Teddy Kennedy remained the figure which disturbed Nixon's slumber.  Chappaquiddick went a long way toward damaging Teddy's prospects, but still it appeared that he would \\"get away with it.\\"  This book suggests that Watergate was an effort to get information which could be used against Kennedy.  It also suggests that the intense Democratic opposition to the War in Vietnam may have been influenced by the Kennedy team's desire to \\"Get Nixon.\\"<br />After Nixon's reelection in 1972, it was largely Teddy Kennedy who pushed the move to \\"Get Nixon\\" leading., ultimately, to his resignation.<br />In the end, these intertwined lives had seen two assassinations, one resignation and the destruction of the presidential prospects of another aspirant, as well as disastrous war.  The book tells much of why the 60s and 70s shaped up the way they did.<br />At the end of the book, I felt a bit remorseful that personal ambition destroyed so much that was good in each of them and detracted from the greatness that each could have achieved.  But, as a Kennedy advisor remarked, \\"To be Irish is to know, in the end, that the world will break your heart.\\"  That is what it did to these two Irish American politicians and, to an extent, to each of us.f a Teddy Kennedy candidacy briefly marred Nixon's prospects.

The quotations are drawn from his speeches and correspondence.  Some contain well known phrases, such as the Gettysburg Address or the Second Inaugural.  Others are drawn from correspondence, originally significant only to the writer and the addressee, but which are now provide windows into Lincoln's soul.<br /><br />As I read through this book, I kept notes of significant quotes which I thought merited rereading.<br /><br />Those entries which are not so memorable do provide insights into issues confronting Lincoln during his career in the Illinois Legislature, Congress, the practice of Law and in the White House.  His correspondence to military and political leaders provide interesting views into particular issues of  the conflict.<br /><br />There are several quotations which I found to be of particular interest for their historical significance, their sound advise or just for their entertainment value.<br /><br />One of his early quotations in which I found lasting wisdom concerned the source of a threat to our national existence.  Lincoln asked:<br /><br />\\"Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the ocean, and crush us at a blow?  Never!  All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in atrial of a thousand years.<br /><br />At what point the is the approach of danger to be expected?...If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher.  As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.\\"<br /><br />As a lawyer, I find his advise given to a member of our profession in 1850 still ring true today:<br /><br />\\"Discourage litigation.  Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can....There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest.  I say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence and honors are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people, it appears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct and vivid.\\"<br /><br />As an historical matter, I find his assessment of the Know-Nothing Movement of the 1840s to be interesting:<br /><br />\\"I am not a Know-Nothing.  How could I be?  How can any one who abhors the oppression of Negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people?...As a nation we began by declaring that \\"all men are created equal.\\"  We now practically read it \\"all men are created equal, except Negroes.\\"  When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \\"all men are created equal, except Negroes and foreigners, and Catholics.\\"  When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty-to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\\"<br /><br />The final example of a quote which I will give is one which is relevant to our current calls for cultural diversity.  Lincoln tells us that those Americans who have no blood ties to the signers of the Declaration of Independence are their heirs because:<br /><br />\\"They feel that the  moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as thought they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote the Declaration...That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.\\"<br /><br />This is a book which I kept in my car for several years to read on overnight trips.  It is excellent for this purpose.  The entries are sufficiently independent to permit the book to be read in increments separate by weeks at a time.  Overall this book is a worthwhile read.\\"    This is a book which I kept in my car for several years to read on overnight trips.  It is excellent for this purpose.

Written by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, in the 16th Century, it presents St. Ignatius' formula  for the pursuit of spiritual perfection.<br />The book itself provides a &quot;guidebook&quot;, if you will, for a 30 day Ignatian retreat.  St. Ignatius presents meditations for each day of the retreat.  The meditations are very brief, leaving broad latitude for the retreat master to direct the retreat along the path most likely to be helpful to the retreatants.<br />While this book certainly is not a &quot;do it yourself&quot; retreat book, it does provide the reader with an accurate insight into the essence of Ignatian Spirituality.  The story of the conversion of St. Ignatius is told in the introductory sections of the book.  St. Ignatius was an ambitious young Basque nobleman in the service of the King of Spain when he suffered a severe leg wound at the battle of Pampeluna.  While recuperating in Loyola Castle, he read the lives of the saints, a book witch redirected his service from that of the King of Spain to the service of the King of Heaven.  As he gradually discerned his calling he unsuccessfully attempted a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, among other pious exercises.  He used the  method of his discernment process as a guideline for others, whether to discern their proper state in life or to more perfectly orient their lives toward God.  The essence of Ignatian spiritually is that all creation is good.  It was created by God to lead all people to Him.  The duty of every Christian is to use all of creation to give honor and glory of God, and to use it to lead all men to their creator.  Just as all creation if fulfilled in God, so to are all people.  The Spiritual Exercises encourage us to always view every potential action in light of how it can give the greatest honor and glory to God.  In so doing it provides us with a standard by which to live our lives.<br />In addition to this general spiritual direction, I found a specific, practical value in this book.  Throughout the book, St. Ignatius, in keeping with his view of all creation as reflecting the glory of God, repeatedly encourages us to use our mind's eye to paint the picture of the scenes depicted in the Scripture which we are reading.  We should imagine the sights, the sounds, the smells, the inflections in the voices, every detail which will bring us into the world of Scripture.  This has been very helpful to me in my roll as Lector at my church.  I think of St. Ignatius' admonitions every time I try to bring the sacred readings alive to the congregation.<br />Perhaps each of you would be touched in ways differently than I, but I feel confident that this book will touch and improve the lives of  all who read it and meditate upon it.e our lives.<br />In addition to this general spiritual direction, I found a specific, practical value in this book.

I then decided to see how this work fit into this theme of Verne's world view.  I found a story which, to the reader of Verne's day, may have seemed as inspiring as the tales of astronauts to contemporary readers.<br />Without giving too much away, \\"Around the World\\" is an improbable tale of Phileas Fogg, an English gentleman who carries his regularity to the extreme of eccentricity.  After engaging a new servant, the Frenchman, Passepartout, Fogg engages his fellows at the Reform Club in a discussion over the possibility of the completion of an around the world journey.  Immediately, Fogg engages in a bet that he can circumnavigate the globe in an eighty day period.  Collecting Passepartout, they set off that very night on a journey which will take them, truly, around the world.<br />Verne's writing was driven, in large degree, by a desire to promote the public acceptance and advancement of science among the French people.  In his journey of 1874, Fogg employs many types of conveyance, from the most primitive to the most technologically advanced of the day.  Verne uses this novel to contrast the industrial might of the United States with the traditional cultural mores of India.<br />We can only try to imagine how this novel would have affected the reader of 1874.  To a modern reader, the book is a light, fast moving novel with a stimulating thread of suspense and just a touch of romance.  What little character development takes place is dwarfed by the demonstration of technological wonder which is depicted throughout the journey.  We do, however, come to know a little about the main characters.  We see Fogg as an eccentric, phlegmatic Englishman, seemingly single-mindedly devoted to achieving his goal of circumnavigation of the globe within the prescribed period.  When Fogg does abandon his single-minded drive it is sidetracked and overwhelmed by his innate senses of honor and duty, almost leading to grave consequences.  Passepartout comes across as a fairly simple-minded servant whose sole purpose in life is the faithful service of his master.  Add in a beautiful damsel and a determined but feckless detective and we have the makings of a most entertaining read with a most unpredictable hero.d.

US	48581126	R1WWVRODEVQF43	0806126159	175881510	Come, Blackrobe: De Smet and the Indian Tragedy	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Missionary and Indians	When my son started his senior year at DeSmet Jesuit High School I thought that it was time to learn more about the man for whom his school is named.  With this in mind I began \\"Come Blackrobe\\".  At the end of the book I was both pleased and a little disappointed.  I was pleased because I had read such a good book about Indian relations in the West and had learned so much about Fr. DeSmet's career..  I was a bit disappointed because so little of Fr. DeSmet's personality had shone through the pages of the book.<br /><br />Fr. DeSmet was a Belgian Jesuit who came to St. Louis in 1823.  Over the next 50 years DeSmet would use St. Louis as his base of a career which ranged from Europe to the Rocky Mountains.  Throughout this half century, DeSmet dedicated his heart and soul in support of missions to the Indians with whom he exchanged trust and affection.<br /><br />Although remembered primarily as a missionary, DeSmet served the Jesuits in several capacities.  He served of the Missouri Province of the Jesuits as treasurer and consultor.  Much of his efforts were directed at recruiting and fundraising in Europe, which lead him to cross the Atlantic twenty-one times.  An internationally recognized figure, he visited Presidents at the White House and was knighted by the King of Belgium.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in DeSmet's service as an army chaplain.  In 1858, DeSmet had served as a chaplain with an army expedition to Utah.  In 1861, DeSmet was personally asked by Col. Francis P. Blair to serve as a chaplain in the Union Army. Blair viewed DeSmet as \\"one of the most beloved and honored priests in the entire country.\\"<br /><br />Fr. Killoren goes on to explain that \\"Archbishop Kenrick, however, saw Blair's move as an inducement to Irish Catholics of the St. Louis area to join the Union ranks.  Kenrick's sympathies were with the South, and the archbishop insisted that DeSmet's Jesuit superior deny Blair's request.\\"<br /><br />I take issue with Fr. Killoren's characterization of Archbishop Kenrick as a Southern sympathizer.  The truth is that Archbishop Kenrick's position on the issue is unknown.  Guiding a divided flock, he maintained a posture of strict neutrality.  His sole public statement on the Civil War was an appeal for moderation and submission to God's will within the Archdiocese.  Archbishop Kenrick was an alumnus of Maymooth Seminary in Ireland at which students were taught to strictly keep the Church out of politics.  The ban on service in the chaplaincy by diocesan priests was general.  He did not display any approval of the actions of the diocesan priest, Rev. John B. Bannon, who did serve as a chaplain to the First Missouri Confederate Brigade.<br /><br />As the title indicates, most of this book relates the story of the tragedies which befell the Indians as they gradually lost the Great Planes to the whites.  Beginning with the Jeffersonian Indian Policy, Fr. Killoren relates the policies up to DeSmet's final visit to the Indians of the Rockies in 1870.<br />DeSmet's initial model for the Indian missions was based on the Jesuit Reductions which had been successful in Paraguay about two centuries before.  The goal of the Reductions was to establish a Native Christian Empire segregated from white encroachment.  By 1847 the influx of whites had demonstrated the impracticality of this model and forced its abandonment.<br /><br />Although never learning an Indian language, DeSmet remained a steadfast friend and protector of the Indians throughout his life.  In many cases, his most helpful contributions were his counsel to the Indians to peacefully accept the growing white intrusion into their lands.  In one incident  DeSmet had to disabuse the Indians of the notion that the hordes of immigrants across the Oregon Trail evidenced a depopulation of the East.<br /><br />Much attention is given to the many rendezvous and meetings between government agents and Indians, some of which  DeSmet attended.  It must havebeen disheartening to DeSmet to have counseled the Indians to enter into so many agreements which were eventually broken by the government, even though agreement was, in the long run, in the Indians' best  interest.<br /><br />DeSmet's career came full circle, ending, fittingly enough, with his last public act, the dedication of the Steamboat DeSmet, which would ply the waters on which its namesake had traveled so often, on the St. Louis river front on May 13, 1873.  On his way to the ceremony, Fr. DeSmet saw the many changes which had taken place during the 50 years that he called St. Louis home.  During that half century, he had served as Missionary, treasurer, vocation recruiter, fund raiser, spiritual counselor and friend.  He died on May 23, 1873.<br /><br />This is really two books in one.  One deals with the relations between the government and the Indians on the Great Plains.  In this Fr. Killoren does an excellent job in relating the story of government policy and the changes it effected in Indians life.<br /><br />The other book deals with Fr. DeSmet and his career.  I said in the beginning that I was both pleased and a little disappointed in this aspect of the book.  I was pleased in the many aspects of Fr. DeSmet's career which are related here.  Fr. Killoren does an excellent job in relating all aspects of this multifaceted career.  My only disappointment is that DeSmet's personality does not shine through the pages of this work.

A loner in a non-literate community, even the stories of Crazy Horse's sparse interactions with whites were often based on speculation and conjecture.<br /><br />I did find this book to provide an interesting narrative of the life and warfare of the Plains Indians in the period after the Civil war.<br /><br />In this book we see the Indians as very individualistic.  The Indian Chiefs, of which Crazy Horse was not one, while exercising considerable influence, could not, in many cases, control the actions of individual braves.  While we often tend to think of the Indians as a monolithic nation opposing white expansion, they consisted, in fact, of independent, autonomous bands which would fight limited struggles against whites over specific territories or grievances.  The struggle by the Indians under Red Cloud over the forts on the Bozeman trail was one instance in which the Indians were successful in turning back the tide of white expansion for several years.<br /><br />Individual battles, such as the Fetterman massacre, are described in interesting detail.<br /><br />As for Crazy Horse himself, such details of his life as are known are related.  The details of his names, his dream experience, his romantic entanglements and finally his death from stabbing by a soldier while being held by an Indian, are described in detail.  The obscurity of Crazy Horse's life may be one of his most alluring qualities, for by permitting each of us to impute to this Indian hero the attributes which seem most attractive to us, he grows from a man to a legend.  As he rides out of the mists of history, Crazy Horse can be seen as the heroic warrior who never compromised or surrendered.  That is the Crazy Horse portrayed by Larry McMurtry and the legend who, when his statue is completed, will ride forever over his Black Hills home.	2001-10-10

The principal character, Padre Leon, is a Spanish Franciscan missionary who, passed over for assignment to the missions of California, is assigned to the obscure village of San Sebastian.  This veteran of the Spanish Army takes up residence in this dusty village held in the grip of terror by the feared Commanche warrior, Golden Lance.<br /><br />Padre Leon undertakes the task, not only of rebuilding the Church of San Sebastian, but that of uplifting the entire community.  Undertaking a myriad of projects, religious, engineering and agricultural, Padre Leon gradually wins the hearts of his parishioners.  Recognizing that only with some security from the annual Commanche raids can San Sebastian lift itself out of its lethargy, Padre Leon undertakes his greatest task, that of building a wall for San Sebastian.<br />As the story progresses toward its climax, Padre Leon is torn between service to his people as a Son of Cortez or greater service to God and his people as a Son of St. Francis.  Ultimately the son of Cortez restores his village's spirit and prosperity while it is through his response to his higher calling as a son of St. Francis that he secures peace for his people.<br /><br />In this book we see Padre Leon as a a soldier turned priest, in the mold of St. Ignatius of Loyola, a builder of missions in the spirit of Junipero Serra, a defender of villages after the model of Padre Kino, and a bulwark against barbarians as was his patron, St. Leo the Great.  The story combines history, the flavor of life in colonial New Spain and soul searching of people trying to do right in their lives.  It is a book well worth reading.	2001-09-08

Maine and the Spanish American War as a whole. In this book, Michael Blow, gives a thorough explanation of the war from political, personal and military perspectives.<br /><br />Michael Blow, grandson of a crew member of the Maine, begins his narrative with a history of the events which had created such turmoil in Cuba as to attract the attention of the American government and public. He then gives a detailed account of the destruction of the Maine on February 15, 1898. The tale of the investigations examines the theories attempting to explain the explosion and contradicts some myths which many of us have heard. The major issue was whether the Maine was destroyed by an external source, such as a mine, or whether the cause was an accidental mishap internal to the ship. Its Captain, Charles Sigsbee, and much of the American press, always insisted that his command was the victim of a mine. I remember being told in school that the Navy could have very easily determined if the explosion was internal or external, but chose to sink the Maine in deep water before an investigation was concluded. In fact, the vessel was subjected to thorough investigations by both American and Spanish authorities. The American court of inquiry of 1898 concluded that the Maine had been sunk by a mine. Further investigation in 1912 again concluded that the source of the explosion was external. Not until the 1970s did Adm. Hiram Rickover, upon review of the evidence, conclude that the cause of the explosion was internal.<br /><br />Blow does a good job of analyzing the potential motives of the forces in Cuba which could have attacked the Maine by mine.<br /><br />The tragedy of the Maine was used by much of the American press to incite the American public, which was already incensed by the Spanish atrocities in Cuba, to demand war. Blow does an excellent job of explaining journalistic agitations and the political maneuvers which lead up to the declaration. He makes clear President McKinley's efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the problem until forced, by political pressures, to ask for a declaration of war.<br /><br />War having been declared, action first occurred in the Philippines, an unexpected theatre, . The U.S. Navy Asiatic Squadron under Adm. George Dewey had destroyed the Spanish squadron in Manila Bay, giving Dewey command of the Bay, if not the city or archipelago itself. This started the long American debate over what to do with the islands, once the conquest was completed.<br /><br />With news of a favorable and stable situation in the Philippines, attention switched to the location of the Spanish fleet under Adm. Cervera which had left Cape Verde on April 29, 1898. Until sited near Santiago de Cuba on May 18, speculation about the location of the Spanish fleet was rampant. It was feared from New England to Texas and was reported as being sited as far as the North Atlantic. The fear was so universal that cottages at Newport, Rhode Island were not opened for fear of Spanish attack.<br /><br />With Cervera in Santiago harbor and the American Army landed in Cuba, that island became the center of attention. The war reached a climax in early July. The American offensive against Santiago was highlighted by the charge of the Rough Riders on July 1. The military pressures against Santiago forced Cervera to attempt to run the fleet out to see against the blockading American forces on July 2. The ensuing running battle resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet, ending the Spanish naval threat in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Blow relates the practical problems presented by the need to return American troops home before tropical diseases accomplished what the Spanish forces had been unable to do. Ample attention is also paid to the political dilemmas in the Unites States created by the conquest of Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam.<br /><br />This narrative is livened by revelations of the characters and personalities of the principal personalities involved, both American and Spanish. Excitement is added to the story by the tale of the dash of the U.S.S. Oregon from the Pacific, around Cape Horn, to arrive in Cuban waters just in time to play a major role in the actions of July 2.<br /><br />I was left with three major impressions of this war from 'A Ship to Remember'. One is the poor state of communications in comparison to those of today. The cable from Manila having been cut by the Spanish, Adm. Dewey was forced to send a ship back to Hong Kong to wire news of the Battle to Washington. This caused a delay of about a week in the relay of the news to Washington. The other surprise was the utter lack of knowledge about the whereabouts of Adm. Cervera. In this day of aircraft and satellite surveillance, it seems incredible that a fleet could be loose on the high seas for three weeks with its location being unknown over a range of several thousand miles, but it happened.<br /><br />The second impression is of the Spanish American as a largely naval war. The battle of Manila Bay was won by the Navy. The main threat in the Caribbean was the Spanish fleet, which was hunted down and destroyed by the Navy. While the Army did conquer Cuba through its battles around Santiago, it relied on the Navy for transportation and supply.<br /><br />The third impression is that this was a war in which American territory was in jeopardy. Although it now seems that it was a war limited to Spanish colonial areas, Cervera did have the potential to have attacked any on of many ports along the eastern seaboard.<br /><br />When I chose this book I was hoping to obtain a general understanding of the Spanish American war. That hope has been fulfilled..<br /><br />This narrative is livened by revelations of the characters and personalities of the principal personalities involved, both American and Spanish.

US	48581126	RPEPC46CFJDKP	1883982405	396754536	The St. Louis Irish: An Unmatched Celtic Community	Books	5	15	17	N	N	The Way We Were, The Way We Are	\\"The St. Louis Irish: An Unmatched Celtic Community\\" is a delightful book which can be appreciated on several levels.<br /><br />On a personal level, any member of this Celtic Community, which includes Fr. Faherty and myself, can enjoy reading the extensive list of names of people who have enriched our Community over the centuries.  In the early chapters we read names familiar to us from a variety of sources.  Some names we know from the other historical books we have read or from the mosaics of the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica which we have admired.  Other names remind us of streets or businesses which have been part of our community for as long as we can remember.  Some names are those of contemporary friends or acquaintances who may be descendants of these notable citizens.  In the later chapters we read of people known to us personally.<br />This book also teaches us the history of St. Louis, which has been shaped, in large degree, by its large Celtic community.  St. Louis' unique history as a Catholic center prepared it to be a fertile ground for Irish settlement.  Unlike eastern cities whose original aristocracy was Anglo-American and Protestant, the original St. Louis aristocracy was French-Canadian and Catholic. This originally French city welcomed the Irish and smoothly integrated them into all walks of St. Louis life.  From the early days of Irish immigration, the Irish have prospered and contributed to the life of the St. Louis community.  I was surprised to learn that many of these early immigrants who were proud members of the St. Louis Celtic community were Protestants, as was the case among the Irish of Ireland.<br /><br />The study of the St. Louis Irish gives us an insight into the histories of America, the Irish and the Irish Americans. Here we see that many of the pre-famine Irish immigrants brought educations and mercantile traditions which were maintained in their new homes.  Many Irish, barred, like European Jews of the day, from land ownership and the professions, had turned to mercantile trades for the employment of their talents.<br /><br />As the world approached the middle of the nineteenth century two related events impacted on our story.  The failure of the Irish potato crop in the 1840s sent millions of poor, uneducated Catholics teeming onto American shores.  For the first time, millions of Catholic, non-Anglo-Saxons threatened the WASP vision of an American culture exclusively its own.  In response to this influx, a nativist movement arose which sought to exclude immigrants and Catholics from American society.  This movement found its political expression in the \\"Know Nothing\\" party in the years before the Civil War.<br /><br />The \\"Know Nothing\\" movement had a significant affect on the St. Louis Irish.  With the mass immigration of the Famine Era, the Irish Community became more working class than mercantile, more Catholic than ecumenical, more self contained rather than an integrated into the local community.  The altered national mood made the Celtic community one with which Protestants preferred not to be identified.  After this time the Protestant Irish tended to identify with and meld into the predominant Anglo-American identity, leaving the Irish community largely Catholic.  From this time on, to be Irish, largely meant to be Catholic.<br />In the later sections of the book, much of the history of the St. Louis Irish is reflected in the history of the Church in St. Louis.  Throughout this period, Fr. Faherty does an excellent job of highlighting many Irish people who played prominent roles in the life of the community.<br /><br />After World War II, the Irish identity became more a memory than an ever present part of our lives.  Irish remained active and prominent in many organizations, but the organizations were no longer exclusively or predominantly Irish in their identity and membership.  We now shared our parishes with Catholics of other ethnic backgrounds, rather than worshipping innational parishes as had earlier generations.  To a large degree, the Irish have merged into the American melting pot.  In order to recover that which we have lost, we now study our past to learn what it is to be Irish.  Many St. Louis Irish of today  know more about Irish history, culture and art than our ancestors to whom Irish was a way of life, rather than an object of study.  Reflecting, perhaps, the divisions in Ireland, St. Louis has become a two parade city.  St. Louis Irish now have to opportunity to choose between two rival St. Patrick's Day Parades.<br />It is said that being Irish is a terrible thing-until you consider all the alternatives.  The behavior of the Irish is sometimes bewildering, even to ourselves.

To anyone wondering what \\"Beyond the Wild Blue: A History of the U.S. Air Force 1947-1997\\" is about, I would recommend a careful look at the title.  The title tells one exactly what the book is and is not.  It is not a history of American Airpower, although the development of the Army Air Corps is briefly presented as background.  It is not a history of the Air Force in war, although the war record of the Air Force is given its due.  Beyond the Wild Blue is the history of the U.S. Air Force during the first 50 years of its existence.  It is, in essence, an organizational history of the Air Force.<br /><br />Reviewers often report that an historical book \\"reads like a novel\\".  I would say that Beyond the Wild Blue develops like a novel.  At the end of a novel the reader often realizes that it possesses a theme or a point to  which the whole book has contributed.  That is the case with this book.  The ultimate point of \\"Beyond the Wild Blue\\" is that the Air Force has been an organization which has constantly striven, through a continuing research and development program, to achieve its mission through the advancement of aerospace technology.  Through his telling of the story of the Air Force as it developed from a stripped down force in the years after World War II to the technological marvel which won the Gulf War, Walter Boyne brings us to realize how the organizational strategy of the Air Force has brought it to the point at which it is the power which it is today.  He also makes us realize the degree to which the Air Force depends on the technical expertise of its officers and enlisted personnel in achieving its mission.<br /><br />Throughout this book, Boyne mixes facts with his candid assessments of personnel who have affected the history of the Air Force.  Generals, Secretaries of Defense and the Air Force as well as politicians all come in for forthright praise or criticism.  Two of Boyne's heroes figure prominently in the story.  General of the Air Force Hap Arnold, who had commanded the Army Air Corps in World War II,  guided the Air Corps to its birth as an independent service and inspired its quest for technological superiority.  General Curtis LeMay, more than any other officer, imprinted his personality and ideals on the Air Force, much to the benefit of the service and the nation.<br /><br />Through this book we see the Air Force, at its inception, as a force poorly equipped with World War II leftovers.  Ill-prepared at the start of the Korean War and handicapped by politically imposed rules of engagement, the Air Force was, nonetheless, able to establish air superiority throughout the peninsula and, thereby, contribute to the United Nations' successes.<br /><br />Through the Cold War years of the fifties and early sixties, the Air Force preserved the peace largely through its capability to deliver nuclear weapons, both by manned bomber and ICBM.<br /><br />The Vietnam War was, for the Air Force as well as all of the American military, a frustrating conflict.  The handicaps imposed by politically inspired rules of engagement were more serious even than those imposed in Korea.  As an example, pilots were forced to risk their lives trying to destroy trucks individually, while being prevented them from destroying freighters full of trucks in North Vietnamese ports.<br /><br />After Vietnam, the Air Force continued its technological improvement at an uneven pace, varying with the political winds of the day.  The ultimate payoff for the Air Force research and development programs would come in the Gulf War.  In this war air control was established, not by defeating an enemy challenge in the air, but by preventing the challenge from arising.  The destruction of Iraqi radar and communications kept the enemy planes hunkered on the ground.  The ability of air power to pick apart Iraqi defenses and destroy and demoralize its ground forces proved the ultimate vindication of the Air Force research and development programs.<br/><br />Throughout this book, Boyne presents an agreeable blend of narration about individuals, equipment, organizational concepts and war stories, detailed enough to hold the interest without leading to boredom.<br /><br />This book addresses all aspects of Air Force service.  Fighters, Strategic and Tactical bombers Air Lift and refueling all are given proper attention.  The recent reorganization of the Air Force Commands was clearly explained.  The changing demands of the American public that victory must be swiftly achieved with few casualties, either of friendly or enemy forces or noncombatants, and the Air Force's ability to meet those demands were presented as a logical result of the continuing research and development programs.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the description of the refueling capabilities which can now keep aircraft flying virtually indefinitely.  Equally impressive is the story of the B-52, which may have a useful life of 75 years from first flight to final retirement.<br /><br />At the conclusion we are presented with an Air Force which has the potential to deliver military punch of unprecedented scope and dimensions.  In an era in which the availability of overseas bases may be limited, the Air Force has the capability, through refueling, of delivering ordinance to virtually any place on earth through missions originating in the United States.  Although beyond the temporal scope of this book, the continuation of the technological advancement was seen in the Bosnian operation in which bombing runs originated and ended in Missouri by warriors who would spend their nights at home with their families .<br />This book is a fitting tribute to the men and women who have carried the story of the United States Air Force into the Wild Blue and Beyond./><br />Throughout this book, Boyne presents an agreeable blend of narration about individuals, equipment, organizational concepts and war stories, detailed enough to hold the interest without leading to boredom.<br /><br />This book addresses all aspects of Air Force service.

Only rarely in the book is Lewis Cass the center of the narrative.  After reading the book, I still do not know if Lewis Cass was ever married or had a family.  I know very little about his personality or disposition.  I know only about his public career and some of the public issues with which he was involved during his long public career.  Cass is presented almost exclusively through his public actions, statements and writings.<br /><br />His public career is quite a story in itself.  This native of New Hampshire move west into Ohio in time for Cass to become a general in the War of 1812, fighting on the front between Detroit and what is now Ontario.  He then stayed in Michigan where he served 18 years as territorial governor.<br /><br />Having grown into a National Statesman, Cass later served Andrew Jackson as Secretary of War, followed by a term as Ambassador to France. Upon to his return to the United States, Cass was a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1844 before a deadlocked convention turned to James K. Polk.  Four years later, Cass won the nomination, only to lose the election to Gen. Zachary Taylor, a loss which, according to the book, was probably attributable to the candidacy of former President Martin Van Buren on the Free Soil Ticket.<br />Presidential politics being behind him, Cass served two terms as Michigan's Senator until the rise of the Republican party swept him out of the Senate and into the cabinet President Buchanan's as Secretary of State.  It was from this position that Cass watched the dissolution of the country as well as the cabinet in the waning days of that administration.<br /><br />Returning to Michigan, Cass supported the cause of national unity until his death in 1866.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this book is the literary style in which it is written.  Throughout the book, Cass is portrayed as a righteous character  opposed by a series of villainous figures toward whom attention is directed in the particular sections of the book.  Prominent among these are General Hull of the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan.  The general style is to relate a particular aspect of history and then allude to the public role which Cass played in it.<br /><br />During the section on the War of 1812, Cass' position is contrasted favorably with that of Gen. Hull who is treated most roughly in the narrative.  In the section on Cass' governorship of the Wisconsin territory, most of the attention is directed to the French inhabitants who occupied the territory at the start of Cass' tenure.  A contrast is drawn the French, who are presented as happy but unambitious, and Cass who introduced American initiative and drive into the territory and, thereby, advanced it into the Western powerhouse which it became.<br />The section on his service in Jackson's cabinet portrays Jackson in a very unfavorable light, while praising Cass.  Cass' service as Minster to France is presented most favorably.<br /><br />Cass' Senate years were dominated primarily by the issues of slavery which were gradually tearing the nation apart.  Cass is portrayed as the creator of the doctrine of Popular Sovereignty in which the voters of each territory would be permitted to decide the issue of slavery for itself.  Swipes are taken at Stephen A. Douglas who is popularly remembered as the advocate of that position.  The conclusion of the Senate service is seen against the backdrop of the swing of the Northwest from its tradition allegiance to the Democracy (Democratic Party) to the new Republican party which would soon sweep the area and the country into Civil War.<br />The service in Buchanan's cabinet is used to present the deterioration of the country as well as Buchanan's feeble efforts to deal with the problem.<br />The style of writing is shockingly judgmental in its treatment of the public figures portrayed in the book.  While modern readers may expect to see facts presented in a way as to portray figures in favorable or unfavorable lights, we rarely expect to see the conclusions presented by strong and extreme adjectives.<br />What real value there is in this book is its portrayal of the general history of the times and places in which Cass played his roles in the nation's drama as portrayed in the 1890s.  It is in seeing our history from through the 1890s eyes of the author that we can take the greatest lessons from this book.ok.

The quotations are interspersed with pictures of the Reagan we know. The quotations are organized by topic into 8 sections.<br /><br />Although containing a few memorable phrases such as \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\", the true substance of this book is to be found in the enduring values reiterated repeatedly by Ronald Reagan over his political career. From his earliest days as Governor, Reagan warned us that freedom is never more than a generation from extinction and that it must be fought for and defended by each generation. His faith in the creative powers of individual people shines through on these pages. Again and again we are reminded that America is the last, best hope of mankind, the shining city on the hill and that its best days lie ahead. One haunting irony is a jest from his 83rd Birthday party in 1994, only months before the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: \\"I'm not one for looking back. I figure there will be plenty of time for that when I get old!\\"<br /><br />This book contains three speeches substantially in their entirety. The first to be presented is the stirring address to the nation the night of the Challenger tragedy. We are reminded that our President pledged that: \\"We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them.\\"  The book concludes with a beginning and an ending of a public career. The career begins with the rousing 1964 speech for Barry Goldwater which propelled Reagan to national prominence and is completed by the heart touching 1992 farewell to the Republican Party.<br /><br />While reading these pages, the reader learns to appreciate the deeply held beliefs which formed Ronald Reign's vision of the world. This vision can serve as a guide for our own lives and helps us to recognize that the speaker truly was the Last Lion of the Twentieth Century.	2001-07-01

When I first met Robert Frost's poetry in Freshman English class I took an immortal wound-that I will never get over it.  Perhaps the then recent memory of the white haired poet who inaugurated Camelot that cold, January day conditioned me to receive the wound.  Maybe Fr. Sheridan's teaching opened these poems for me.  Most of all, I think that it is the words themselves which have made the poetry of Robert Frost such an important part of my life for almost 35 years.<br /><br />This complete collection complemented the high school text book to which I had so often referred over the years.  Here is the source of lines which I have often quoted.  Many family vacations have begun with: \\"I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep\\" (Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening).<br />When my son tries to silence his sister's singing he is reminded that \\"Of course there must be something wrong In wanting to silence any song\\" (A Minor Bird).<br />Here we find philosophical reflections.  \\"Good walls make good neighbors\\" counters \\"Something there is that doesn't like a wall\\" (Mending Wall).<br />Here \\"The Death of a Hired Man\\" challenges us to reflect upon how we value and treat others while \\"Christmas Trees\\" reminds us that not all things have prices.  Here we are invited to follow the road of the poet who wrote \\"I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference\\" (The Road Not Taken).<br /><br />I have writen just a sampling of the treasures to be found in this collection, but I have written enough.  It is now time to indulge again with words I have never forgotten.  \\"I shan't be gone long-You come too.\\" (The Pasture).ten.  \\"I shan't be gone long-You come too.\\" (The Pasture).	2001-06-29

It was one of the best literary decisions I ever made.<br /><br />\\"The Fifth Week\\" is divided into three sections: Jesuits of the Past; Jesuits of the Present; and Jesuits of the Future.<br /><br />It was the first two sections which primarily attracted me to this book.  Jesuits of the Past and Jesuits of the Present consist of brief biographies of Jesuit heroes.  As a product of Jesuit education, I had heard many of these names, either in sketchy legends or on the nameplates of schools or buildings.  This book put stories to these names.<br /><br />The first and longest biography belongs, fittingly enough, to St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society.  During a forced convalescence from battlefield wounds, a reading of the Lives of the Saints transformed this servant of the King of Spain into one of the most illustrious servants of the King of Heaven.<br />Other biographies bring the brightest stars in the Jesuit sky to life.  St. Francis Xavier, after whom my College Church is named, was the great missionary who took the Faith to the Orient.  St. Edmund Campion had to me been merely the patron of a building at college.  From this book I learned that he was a 16th century Jesuit who trained in Prague before returning to his native England to minister to Catholics during the height of the Reformation persecution of the Church until his martyrdom in 1581.<br /><br />Another interesting English Jesuit of the Reformation era was St. Nicholas Owen.  St. Nicholas was a Jesuit brother who's main ministry was the building of priestly hideouts in the great houses of English Catholics until he was captured and tortured to death in 1606.<br /><br />One of the most notable exemplars of the Jesuit charism is Matteo Ricci who followed in the footsteps of St. Francis Xavier in bringing the Gospel to the Orient.  In keeping with the Jesuit theme of using all things to bring people to God, Matteo followed St. Paul's entreaty to be all things to all men.  Immersing himself in Chinese culture and adopting Chinese dress, he obtained acceptance into the Chinese Imperial Court.  From this position started a movement which in 50 years was to include 150,000 Chinese Catholics.<br />Among my favorite heroes are the North American Martyr, St. John de Breboeuf,  and Peter DeSmet, the St. Louis  based western missionary and patron the high school at which my son studied this book.<br /><br />The explanation of the suppression of the Jesuits occurring in various places from 1759-1814 was a movement of which I had heard and read but which I did not understand until reading this book.<br /><br />The Jesuits of the Past section concludes with the biography of Blessed Miguel Pro, \\"Jesuit Clown.\\".  My family and I had first heard of Miguel Pro during a passing reference in a homily to \\"Viva Christo Rey-Long Live Christ the King!\\",  his last words while facing a firing squad.  His story was, actually, similar to that of St. Edmund Campion.  Driven from his native Mexico by anticlerical persecutions, Pro studied in California, Spain, Nicaragua and Belgium.  Sneaking back into Mexico after ordination, his skillful use of a series of disguises permitted him to minister to the faithful for 2 years during which he avoided capture by the authorities.<br /><br />Section 2 highlights contemporary Jesuits.  Daniel Lord used teaching, writing, theatre and social action to bring God to his people.  World War II made heroes of Carl Hausman, a prisoner of the Japanese in the Philippines and Joseph O'Callahan, a chaplain aboard the U.S.S. Franklin during a devastating Kamikaze attack.  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a paleontologist who brought the faith to the world of science.<br /><br />Fr. O'Malley begins the transition from Section 2 to Section 3 by introducing the story of his own vocation.<br /><br />Section 3 is the storyof the Jesuits of the Future.  An inquiry into the Society of today, the challenges of the world and obstacles to a religious vocation are viewed reflectively.  The book concludes with the questions a man must confront in discerning whether he has a vocation to the priestly or religious life.  The final pages are devoted to the practical steps one must take in order to explore the possibility of living the Jesuit life.<br /><br />I began this book I with high expectations.  At its conclusion my expectations were fulfilled.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the stories of  Jesuit heroes as well as anyone who wants to understand what has attracted so many outstanding men of the past to the Society of Jesus and what continues to attract the Church leaders of tomorrow.of the Jesuits of the Future.

Since my first reading of \\"The Call of Pope Octavian\\" it has become one of my favorite novels.  Set during the conclave called to choose a successor to a retiring Pope John Paul II, this novel has what it takes to hold my attention.  History, the promise of church reforms and a dash of suspense make this a thought provoking book.<br /><br />This story is told from two perspectives.  The principal one is that of Andrea Aschenbrenner, the religion reporter for the St. Louis Lodestar.  Aschenbrenner's deeply felt concerns about the role of women in the church are revealed during her discussions with other American reporters covering the conclave, in as well as in her quiet time thoughts.  The other perspective is that of the fly on the wall at conversations of the cardinal electors prepatory to and during the conclave.<br /><br />Father Faherty, professor Emeritus of history at St. Louis University, uses Andrea's interviews with her St. Louis University professors and others with whom she comes in contact to expound on his views of recent church history.  The historical assessments of Twentieth Century Popes is very edifying.  Highlights of Papal which history work their way into the dialogues force the readers rethink our own understandings of current institutions of the Church.  The explanation of the significance of the name Octavian gives a hint to the reforms to be implemented by the new Pope who adopts that moniker.  Father Faherty's views of some St. Louis institutions and personalities are clearly seen through the thin veil of this novel.<br /><br />With his election, Pope Octavian immediately implements a series of reforms which alter the church structure as we know it.  While based on sound Catholic doctrines and authoritative church documents, the reforms can be described, in essence, as the conquest of American inspired spirit of liberty over the faith in Rominata, the attitude that sees all wisdom in Rome, which has so long held sway over the Vatican.<br /><br />One a personal basis, the repeated references to places and institutions with which I am familiar and persons who I know, or know of, adds to the enjoyment of this splendid book.  The reference to one council father of a \\"physically unimpressive cardinal from some place along the Mississippi\\" is easily recognized as the bishop by whom I was confirmed.<br /><br />Whether you are a St. Louisan or not, \\"The Call of Pope Octavian is an excellent read for anyone interested in the history and, more importantly, the future of the Church.><br />One a personal basis, the repeated references to places and institutions with which I am familiar and persons who I know, or know of, adds to the enjoyment of this splendid book.

This short book is divided into eight sections, each dealing with a different aspect of Jefferson life or outlook.  Each section begins with a brief introduction followed by a collection of quotations from Jefferson's writings.  Some are drawn from well known public writings, such as the Declaration of Independence, whereas others are to be found in Jefferson's private correspondence.  In most cases the source of the quotation is given, inviting the reader to conduct further study.<br /><br />In the study of collections of quotations such as this, I often find the greatest insights not in the points which the speaker intended to make but in lessons to be learned by the contrast between the speaker's implied assumptions and the accepted standards of our day. An example of this is found in this book is Jefferson's statement on the public assemblies from which: \\"there would be excluded...women who, to prevent deprivation of morals ambiguity of issue, could not mix promiscuously in the public meetings of men.\\"  When I read statements such as this I think that, perhaps, the morals of our day do not compare unfavorably with those of past generations.<br /><br />Overall I consider this book to be a good introduction into the mind and life of Thomas Jefferson.  While only scratching the surface of his thought, it does provide a sources for some quotations with which to leaven our speech as well as providing an encouragement for further study.	2001-06-01

We knew that it was a very important period of our history in which the Roosevelt administration attacked the depression with an alphabet soup of agencies. The New Deal managed to alter the political balance of the United States for the balance of the century, but which was really unsuccessful in ending the depression until the advent of World War II.  It was to learn more about what really went on during the New Deal that I opened William E. Leuchtenburg's \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\\".  I was very pleased as I read this book.<br /><br />At the start of the book I was expecting this to be a propaganda piece for FDR.  While the author seems to view the New Deal with favor, I did find the book to seem to be a rather even handed account of this period of history.<br /><br />Leuchtenburg begins the book with an analysis of the conditions existing at the beginning of the New Deal.  The advancing gloom of 1932 provides the background for the beginning of the story.  The progressively desperate measures of the Hoover administration are contrasted with the rising tide of the Roosevelt movement in the Democratic Party.  The shadows of despair lengthened in the winter between the November elections and the March inauguration.  This section of the book both reinforced and challenged my prior understandings.  The fact that the economy deteriorated significantly over the winter was confirmed.  My prior readings, presented from President Hoover's point of view, emphasized Roosevelt's unwillingness to endorse any attempts by the administration to deal with the worsening crisis.  Rather than illustrating a shallow and indifferent character, Leuchtenburg presents the time as one in which Roosevelt resisted Hoover's attempts to commit the new administration to continue programs favored by the old.<br /><br />The section on the first 100 days emphasizes the uncritical manner with which the Congress rushed to approve most measures sent to the Hill from the White House.  The session of 1934 was another time of accomplishment for the Administration although the front of solidarity began to crack.<br /><br />The High Tide of the New Deal came with the election of 1936 in which Roosevelt carried all states except Maine and Vermont.  In the aftermath of the election, as occurs after so many landslides, Roosevelt over reached his grasp and suffered a major rebuff with the defeat of his court packing bill in 1937.  Over this issue, Roosevelt alienated some of his most loyal supporters, including his own vice-president.  With that battle, the New Deal had, for the most part, exhausted itself.  While domestic challenges remained, the New Deal had run out of answers.  The hope of 1933 had given way to a sense of hopelessness as the economy plunged again in 1938.  The specter of permanent massive unemployment was seen by more and more as the New Deal initiatives failed to end the depression.<br /><br />Toward the end of the thirties, the challenges rose on the overseas horizons.  Leuchtenburg skillfully narrates the change of focus of the administration from moving the country out of the fear of the depression to one of moving the country to face the dangers looming abroad.  Roosevelt's struggles against the strong strain of isolationism are skillfully presented.<br /><br />There are several things which I learned from this book.  The New Deal as a modification to preserve the social order, rather than as a revolution to upend that order is a point well made.  The delineation between the steps which Roosevelt would take as opposed to those which he would not consider were interesting.  The mention that the main concern of the New Deal was the plight of the farmer came as a surprise to me.  I had always thought that it was mainly concerned with industry.  The acknowledgment that full employment was not achieved until 1943 says much about the economic effectiveness of the New Deal.  I finished the book with a much better understanding of what the New Deal was than I started out with.<br /><br />As the title indicates, this book is primarily about Franklin Roosevelt.  While many other actors in the drama, both within and without the administration, play important roles, the focus is always on Roosevelt.  This is proper because, in truth, Roosevelt was the master of the New Deal.  The book makes the point that if the gun of Zangara has struck down the Roosevelt, rather than Cermak in Miami, a Gardner administration would have directed history much differently.  Truly this was a case in which a great personality did make a great difference.<br /><br />The treatment of FDR is very good.  Stressing his initiatives, which met with both success and failure, Leuchtenburg gives us a view of the influence of Franklin D. Roosevelt on history through his leadership of the New Deal.  There is no place in this book for an inquiry into personal lives, so common in modern historical and biographical literature.<br /><br />This book is an excellent choice for anyone interested in an overview of the New Deal.  I would recommend it for teachers at the high school or collegiate level for class assignments, students looking for materials for book reports, or anyone wishing to acquaint himself with a fascinating and influential period in our history.  It fulfilled all of the hopes with which I opened the book.nomic effectiveness of the New Deal.

The story leads into the exploration of Jean Nicolet who opened the door to Wisconsin.  The story then moves on to later explorers and there relation with the Indians.<br /><br />The first white man in Wisconsin seems to be Etienne Brule.  With the coming of Brule exploration gave way to settlement and economic exploitation, primarily by fur traders.  Settlements in Wisconsin provided the base for the exploration by Louis Jolliet and Pere Jacques Marquette of the Mississippi River in 1673.<br />After the story of Jolliet and Marquette, the story continues with the explorations of Tonti, La Salle and others.  One thing I learned from this book was that the coureur du bois were not considered the noble knights of the woods but were actually unlicensed outlaw trappers.<br /><br />Eventually with the War of 1812, the Americanization of Wisconsin began.  As this story is told, the cohesiveness of the book begins to break down somewhat.  The book tends to unravel into a series of anecdotal stories, rather than an organized development of a unified story.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a collection of genealogies which can be worthwhile for someone interested in those lines.<br /><br />With my interest in French-Canadian history and the history of our Wisconsin summer playground, Wisconsin's Early French Habitants is an enjoyable read.  For the more general reader it may come up a bit short.	2001-05-28

In this book Howarth does a good job of describing the movement from the perspectives of the three main interests involved.  The main interests are the indigenous Greeks, the European Philhelenes (lovers of Greece) and the Turks.<br />The indigenous Greek forces consisted of various bands of bandits and local warlords who availed themselves of the opportunities to improve their own positions provided by the rebellion against the Turks.  Although viewed by the Philhelenes as the noble descendants of Ancient Greece, Greeks of the day were no more closely related to the ancient Greeks than the moderns of any other European nations are related to their ancient antecedents.  The architectural relics of Ancient Greece, so admired by the Philhelenes were, to the natives, only embarrassing reminders of a pagan past.  The Greeks, in the final measure, did not live up to the high ideals which the Philhelenes had imputed to them.<br /><br />The role of the Philhelenes was crucial to the success of the war.  It was they who provided the funds supporting the revolt, much of it from loan subscriptions in Britain.  Most prominent among the Philhelenes was the English poet, Lord Byron, who gave his reputation, his fortune and, ultimately, his life in service of Greek independence.  Despite his high profile, the author concludes that there is little contribution which can be said to be traceable to his involvement.  It can also be said that the Philhelenes provided the intellectual concept of a noble Greek tradition which cried for a national expression.  While much of the money donated to the cause was squandered, this national ideal was the indispensable contribution of the Philhelenes, without which Greek independence may not have been achieved.  Although high in their ideals, the Philhelenes were more noted for their inefficient failures than for their successes.<br /><br />The Turks, against whom the revolt was directed, were represented primarily by the vassals to whom the Sultan made promises in return for service.  Too inept to swiftly conquer the ragtag bands of bandits and foreign idealists, the Turks were able to keep the war going until the European powers were able to agree on a formula for ending the conflict.<br /><br />In the end, it was a treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Russia which led to the resolution of the war.  Pursuant to the Treaty of London a joint three power naval fleet destroyed the Turkish fleet in the battle of Navarino, ending the war and guaranteeing Greek independence.<br /><br />This relatively short book is an interesting introduction to the Greek struggle for independence.  My rating is more indicative of my mild interest in Greek history rather than any dissatisfaction with the book.  The author does a good job of narrating a story with which many readers are unfamiliar.  Although its place and many of its personal names involved are difficult to follow, the author tells the story in a manner which holds the attention of the reader.

From a distance we see the big picture of an historical event, without noticing the distortions apparent on closer inspection.  In World War II, the big picture is that all of Europe ganged up on the evil Fascists in Germany and Italy, except for a few sacrosanct neutrals, such as Switzerland and Sweden.  As \\"Neither Friend Nor Foe\\" points out, this is not the whole truth.<br /><br />At the start of World War II there were four belligerent states: Germany, Poland, France and the United Kingdom.  Every other European state declared its neutrality.  Only five would maintain that neutrality throughout the war: Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.  This book is the story of how each of them avoided the ravages of war by a careful and varying balancing of relations with the powers warring around them.<br /><br />I suspect that most people view the neutrality of Switzerland as an accepted fact of European politics.  In this book, Jerrold Packard shows how it was jeopardized in World War II.  In cooperation with the Nazi program to unite all German people under one Reich,  Pro-Nazi political parties in Switzerland supported the incorporation of at least the German speaking cantons of Switzerland into that Reich.  The Swiss tradition of hospitality toward the refuges from its neighbors s an irritant to Germany.  What ultimately saved Swiss neutrality was the fact that it was of more value to Germany as an independent nation than it would have been as a conquered one.  The Swiss had a plan to destroy its industrial facilities and defend its \\"Fortress Switzerland\\" would have rendered useless an essential source of supply to the Germany.  Switzerland survived the war as a neutral site for clandestine meetings between belligerents as well as an industrial supplier to the German war machine, at prices dictated by the purchaser.  As the tide of war flowed in the Allies' favor, the Swiss willingness to supply Germany diminished proportionately.<br /><br />The Swedish situation was similar to that of Switzerland, in that its willingness to supply the German war machine with the output of its industry provided it with a degree of security.  One concession to German arms was as its permission for German forces to cross its territory to attack Norway As with Switzerland, Sweden shifted its allegiance as the fortunes of battle changed.<br /><br />Portugal had been a long time ally of Britain.  It was caught between the traditional British Alliance and a newfound Iberian identity.  The threat of British invasion of the Portuguese colonies and Iberia itself versus the danger of substituting German vassalage for a British one was a strong inducement for Portugal to keep Iberia neutral.<br /><br />Spain is, in some ways the most interesting of the neutrals.  Exhausted from its Civil War in which Germany and Italy had provided assistance to the Fascists, Franco nevertheless resisted strong German pressure to enter the war as a belligerent.  It did provide some aid to Germany, such as allowing naval use of the Canary islands.<br /><br />Ireland is unique among the neutrals in that it was located squarely in the British sphere of influence.  Irish neutrality was a result, in large measure, of continued hostility to an Empire from which it had won its independence only 20 years before.  The tradition of Ireland as an route to invasion of Britain was also an important consideration.  A major Anglo-Irish issue was the use of the Treaty Ports on which Britain had long relied to support its naval defense into the Atlantic.  Had not Britain surrendered its rights a year before the war started, Prime Minister De Valera knew that Ireland would have been considered a legitimate British military target and Irish neutrality would have lasted little longer than that of the Low Countries.  Throughout the war, De Valera played the card of tweaking the British noses both to convince Germany of the fact of Irish neutrality and to warm the hearts of Irish nationalists.<br /><br />In today's climate, any want of vigor in opposing Nazism is considered cause for condemnation.  In light of the devastation suffered by the European belligerents, I think that the leaders who saved their nations from the ravages of war were leaders who served their countries well.<br /><br />Which individuals emerge as the most memorable leaders among the neutrals?  I nominate Franco as the hero.  Indebted to Hitler and Mussolini and envious of Gibraltar, an entry into the war as an Axis would have seemed to have been a natural course for him to follow.  I suspect that it took tremendous courage to save Spain from another dose of the agony of war.<br /><br />I evaluate Eamon De Valera's record as the most mixed.  His visit to the German Ambassador to extend the condolences of the Irish nation on the death of Adolph Hitler may have carried protocol to an unnecessary extreme.  In his  address to the Irish nation in response to Winston Churchill's victory message, he may have provided the most memorable utterance by a neutral.  The address reached its high point with the inquiry:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain's stand alone...Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for  one year or two but for several hundred years of aggression, that endured spoliation, famines, massacres, in endless succession, that was clubbed many times into insensibility but that each time on returning to consciousness took up the fight anew, a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered its soul.\\"<br /><br />This is a rousing conclusion to a splendid book.yed the card of tweaking the British noses both to convince Germany of the fact of Irish neutrality and to warm the hearts of Irish nationalists.<br /><br />In today's climate, any want of vigor in opposing Nazism is considered cause for condemnation.

From the founding of the city to most recent time, Fr. Faherty tells the story which truly is a continuing dream by the River.<br /><br />Beginning with the early intermittent clerical visits, the story builds through colonial times to the development of a stable and growing Catholic community in the new republic.  Throughout this book, Faherty acquaints the reader with not only the history of Catholicism, but he also shows how the Church affected the community as a whole as well as the contributions of the Church in St. Louis to the national and universal churches.

Other chapters deal with various other themes in the history of the local church.<br /><br />St. Louis has been blessed with a series of good shepherds.  The first bishop to call St. Louis home, Bishop Louis DuBourg of Louisiana, got St. Louis started on the road to religious prominence by establishing his see in St. Louis, rather than the more likely City of New Orleans.  Too much of an impractical idealist to be well suited for service on the frontier, DuBourg nevertheless made important contributions through the utilization of his European contacts to attract the first of many religious who would contribute so much to St. Louis from DuBourg's time to the present day.  His service to St. Louis concluded, DuBourg was appointed  to a diocese in France.<br /><br />The first bishop of St. Louis, Joseph Rosati, was a much more practical builder who raised his diocese on the foundations laid by DuBourg.  During his stewardship (1827-43) the recruitment of European religious communities continued to contribute to the city.  Among the challenges which Rosati confronted was the rise of anti-Catholicism during the Know-Nothing movement as well as the problems arising from the immigration of new ethnic and religious groups.  His greatest brick and mortar legacy is the Old Cathedral in downtown St. Louis in which he is now buried.<br />The century following Rosati's tenure was dominated by two giants, Peter Kenrick and John Cardinal Glennon.  Kenrick, the first Archbishop of St. Louis,  led his archdiocese from 1843-1895.  During his tenure St. Louis passed from being a frontier town, through Civil War to become one of the leading cities of the nation.  Adopting a policy of strict neutrality while shepherding a divided city, the only statement which Kenrick issued about the Civil War was one  calling for moderation.<br /><br />It was during the First Vatican Council that Kenrick took his place as one of the leading churchmen of the English speaking world, being one of the leading opponents of the definition of the doctrine of Papal Infallibility.

Dissenting Priest in American Life\\" I was convinced that this was a book which I did not want to read.  As I traditional Catholic who places a high premium on loyalty to the Church, I find the mention of dissenting priests to be distasteful.  Later, when I did read it with Fr. Faherty's encouragement, I was most pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />This book is a collection of brief biographies of ten priests who, in taking courageous stands, rebelled against either their superiors or the prevailing cultural mores.  Their stories give an insight into the rich contributions these priests have made to American life.<br /><br />The first featured priest is one whom I have studied extensively, the French-Canadian missionary, Fr. Pierre Gibault.  Fr. Gibault spent his career in the what was then the Illinois Country.  From 1768 to 1802 he served the scattered communities of Cahokia and Kaskaskia, Illinois, St. Louis and New Madrid, Missouri and Vincennes, Indiana. Fr. Gibault's interaction rendezvous with destiny began with the arrival of the Virginia militia at Kaskaskia on July 4, 1778.  Fr. Gibault's ecclesiastical superior the Bishop of Quebec,  had instructed his flock to support the British cause,  partly because of British support of religious freedom in Canada.  Despite his instructions, Fr. Gibault successfully encouraged the habitants of Kaskaskia, Cahokia and Vincennes to support Clark and the Americans.  Without the support of these French and their Indian allies, it is quite likely that Clark's mission would have failed resulting in a more southerly boundary line between the United States and Canada in the Western Great Lakes region.<br /><br />Peace among nations did not bring peace to Gibault.  Ignored by both the Bishop of Quebec and  Bishop Carroll of Baltimore, who jurisdiction covered the United States,  Fr. Gibault ultimately crossed to the Spanish west bank of the Mississippi to conclude his career under in New Madrid, Missouri.<br /><br />The actions of Fr. Gibault, the first dissenting priest in American history, played a major role in determining the extent of the country whose cause he adopted.<br />The second dissident priest is another about whom I have studied and written, John B. Bannon.  Ordained in Ireland at a time of clerical surplus, Bannon followed so many other Irish across the water to serve his compatriot,  Archbishop Peter Kenrick of St. Louis.  Settling in St. Louis, a city to be divided by Civil War, Bannon served as pastor of St. John Parish where he presided over the building of its church in which I occasionally worship.  With the coming of war, Bannon, in disobedience of Archbishop Kenrick's orders of neutrality, slipped away to serve as chaplain of the First Missouri Confederate Brigade.  After capture and parole, Bannon undertook a mission to Ireland to discourage young men from immigrating to join the Union Army.  Cognizant of anti-southern climate prevalent in Missouri after the war, as well as the displeasure of Archbishop Kenrick,  Fr. Bannon remained in Ireland where he became one of the leaders of the Irish Jesuit community.<br /><br />The third featured dissident, Fr. John Cummings, became entangled in controversy flowing out of the Civil War.  The Missouri Constitution of 1865 required clergymen to take an oath denying 86 acts ranging from outright treason to \\"admitting dissatisfaction with the government of the United States.  Archbishop Kenrick had advised his priests not to take the oath, apparently in hopes that it would not be enforced.  Enforced it was and Fr. Cummings, of Louisiana, Missouri, became the test case for the oath.  Convicted and confined to jail for a week, the case ultimately became a politically charged issue in the Supreme Court of the United States where the conviction was overturned on a 5-4 vote.  His moment in history over, Fr. Cummings had only three years of service left before his untimely death in 1870.<br /><br />For the next few chapters, Fr. Faherty turns to priests who became involved in social justice issues.  Fr. Cornelius O'Leary sided the Knights of Labor in 1886 in its struggle with the Missouri Pacific Railroad in DeSoto, Missouri.  In so doing, Fr. O'Leary placed himself in direct opposition to the position of his Archbishop, Peter Kenrick.  Always a supporter of labor, Fr. O'Leary was denied a pastorate for the lifetime of Archbishop Kenrick.<br /><br />The story of Fr. Edward McGlynn of New York highlights his efforts to fight poverty in late 19th Century New York by supporting the economic and political initiatives of Henry George.  George's promotion of the single tax theory was condemned by Church authorities in the United States and Rome.  Fr. McGlynn's actions lead to his priestly suspension for a time before his reinstatement to his priestly duties.<br />The first half of the 20th Century saw the work of Fr. John Ryan to implement the social principles of Rerum Novarum through support of labor legislation in the United States.<br /><br />The struggle for Negro equality attracted the efforts of many priests, represented by three of Fr. Faherty's heroes.  Fr. Stephen Theobold was the first black priest trained in the United States.  Throughout his career he challenged the color barrier in the Church.  Fr. William Markoe, S.J., devoted himself to the then unpopular Negro apostolate in St. Louis.  Fr. Louis Twomey, S.J., spent his career working for social progress throughout the south until his death in 1969.<br />The final biography is that of Fr. John Courtney Murray, S.J., a theologian who played a major role in leading the church to greater support for religious freedom, culminating in the Vatican II's \\"Declaration of Religious Liberty\\".<br /><br />These brief biographies give us an insight into the important role played by these priest in guiding the life of our country and church.  They are stories truly worth reading and pondering.70.<br /><br />For the next few chapters, Fr. Faherty turns to priests who became involved in social justice issues.  Fr.

Morgan, was a 19th century whaler which was unique, primarily, because it is the only survivor of its genre and era.  As a typical whaler of its era, the story of the Charles W. Morgan gives the reader an insight into the whaling industry as well as a glimpse into life aboard a whaler.<br /><br />Author John Leavitt begins the book with an description of the construction of the ship at New Bedford, Massachusetts.  He then describes the nautical equipment on the Morgan as well as the equipment's employment on the its voyages.  The usage of the equipment to sail the ship, capture the whales, the processing of the whales and the storage of the whale materials is described in interesting detail.<br />Leavitt continues his narrative with highlights from the voyages of the Morgan.  He relates the economics of the whaling industry as well  the routine of the sailors who manned her.  The interesting characters who served aboard her add a human interest dimension to this book.  The and the life of the occasional captain's wife who accompanied her husband on voyages is a surprising element of life aboard the Morgan.  I found it interesting that the Morgan avoided the Civil War by being at sea for most of its duration.<br /><br />The end of the American whaling industry and, with it, the commercial career of the Morgan are well described in this book.  When the Morgan appeared to be condemned to follow the route of all other whalers which had outlived their usefulness, a group of preservationists came forward to preserve this unique representative of such a major portion of America's Maritime Heritage.  The steps which led to the saving of the Morgan and its transformation into the most prominent exhibit at Mystic are reported in the book's final chapter.<br /><br />The appendices provide lists of the voyages of the Morgan and the rosters of the crews which served her.<br /><br />For this fan of Mystic Seaport, this short book provides an interesting and educational view into the world of whaling in general and the Morgan in particular.

Not limiting his history to the water's edge, Father Faherty gives some background to the English origins of the religious rivalries which the colonists carried with them to the colonies.<br /><br />The road to Independence also led to greater tolerance for the Church.  This resulted, in large measure, from the welcome aid the new nation received from its Catholic allies, France and Spain.  The success of the Revolution brought into the nation a Catholic population which, unlike most of its new compatriots, was not of British origin.  The French settlers of the interior sparsely populated a vast region in which Catholicism was the dominant faith.  The first prominent American Catholic family was the Carrolls of Maryland, a family which provided a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the first Bishop in the United States.  It is the legacies Lord Baltimore and of Bishop Carroll which give Baltimore its status as the oldest American diocese.  As America grew through the War of 1812 and the Era of Good Feeling, the Church grew with it.<br /><br />The increase in immigration from Catholic countries, primarily Ireland and Germany, created both opportunities and threats for the Church.  No longer a minority to be ignored, Catholics began to constitute an increasing and largely foreign portion of the populace.  This lead to the Know-Nothing movement of hostility to Catholics and foreigners, bringing with it new persecutions of the Church.<br /><br />Responding to its new status as a surrounded minority, the Church soon became and remains a major provider of education.  Distrustful of the Protestant orientation of public schools, Catholic parishes began their network of parochial grade and Catholic high schools.  The growth of higher education in 19th and 20th century America was driven, to a large degree, by colleges and universities founded by Catholic religious orders.<br /><br />As the Church welcomed the huddled masses of Europe, a tension which strained the secular social fabric also pulled at the Church.  Just as the influx of non-British immigrants challenged the definition of America as an White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nation, so it drove the Church into a defining moment.  The Church had to choose whether to remain a collection of European churches serving ethnic communities in the United States or to shepherd its flocks into the mainstream of American culture.  The choice was not always easy or obvious, but, ultimately, the Church did play a role in bringing its faithful into full American citizenship.<br /><br />The Civil War tested the Church, as it tested the nation.  Like the nation of which it was a part, the loyalties largely split along geographic lines.  Individual Catholics did achieve prominent positions in various roles.  Catholic chaplains left heroic stories as did the Nuns who provided a large proportion of the nurses serving the sick and wounded.  Like its nation, the postwar Church in America failed to seize the opportunity to help fully integrate the emancipated slaves into the American nation.<br /><br />The first Vatican council of 1870 was the first opportunity for American Catholic bishops to play a prominent role in the Universal Church.  One major issue of the Council was the question of papal infallibility.  The opposition to the doctrine was primarily centered in the English-speaking countries.  Those in Catholic countries saw the definition of the doctrine as an opportunity to shore up a hierarchy under attack by democratic and anti-religous movements throughout Europe.  Those prelates who served minority communities in their countries, saw that the doctrine would be misunderstood in their countries and would createproblems for their flocks.  The American bishops were motivated in their opposition to the definition by two concerns.  One was that infallibility rested in the bishops collectively and not in the Pope individually.  The other was that, even if the doctrine could be agreed on, the promulgation of it at that time would not be helpful.  After the doctrine of Papal Infallibility was accepted by the Council, the American bishops who had opposed the measure pledged their acceptance of the decision.<br /><br />After covering the above summarized topics, Father Faherty writes of various individuals who were prominent in supporting social reforms.<br /><br />In the final chapters, Father Faherty records how the actions of his hero, Pope John XXIII, initiated the modernization of the Church in America and around the world.  Vatican Council II was another world forum in which American bishops figured prominently and with more success than their predecessors had a century before.  The exuberance of the Council ended as the winds blowing out of the Council withered  some of the traditions of the Church in the without nurturing immediately adequate replacements.<br /><br />Father Faherty ends by saying that American Catholics of our age stand in relation to their country as the Christians of the second century did to the Roman Empire.  We are part of a society which will either become totally secular or, as did the Roman Empire, totally Christian.

The contributions of all major naval powers are well documented.  In this book, Boyne organizes the story according to the various fields of activity.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job in breaking down each aspect of the naval war.  Within each topic Boyne describes the strategies pursued, the importance of the operations under consideration to the overall course of the war as well as the tactics employed by the combatants.<br /><br />The various aspects of the naval war are presented from the perspectives of the participating navies.  North Atlantic convey warfare is presented from the perspectives of both the attacking German and defending Allied forces.  Similar treatment is given to other maritime aspects, such as the U-boat threat, support of both amphibious landings and ground campaigns, naval evacuations of land forces, the naval war in the Pacific, and the contribution of naval aviation to the final air attack on Japan.<br /><br />The War in the Pacific is approached from many angles.  The underlining objectives and means of achieving them of both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Allied Navies are explained in detail.  The Japanese objective of creating enough havoc with its initial strikes so as to obtain the time in which to establish an unassailable Japanese position throughout the Western Pacific is analyzed, both in terms of its vision as well as the reasons for its failure.  The Allied executions of their strategies after the Pearl Harbor disaster are equally examined.<br />The role of various naval units are analyzed.  Sections include those devoted to the roles of aircraft carriers, battleships, PT boats, naval aviation and other services.<br /><br />Attention is directed to the details of significant naval engagements of the war.  The details included are sufficient to convey a sense developments without boring the reader.<br /><br />Clash of Titans provides the reader with a good introduction into the leading naval personalities of the war.  In so doing, Boyne spotlights those individuals whose contributions were important to the conduct of the wars.  Little attention is paid to sailors who later became celebrities.  The section on PT warfare contains one brief mention of John F. Kennedy.  The section on submarine rescue of downed pilots omits any mention George Bush.<br /><br />If there is one defect in this book, I find it in the claims of the potential significance of Axis naval warfare efforts.  Prominent among these claims is the suggestion that the German navy submarine and surface raiders, if properly employed in sufficient numbers, could have altered the ultimate outcome of the war.  Given the extent of the land and air aspects of war I doubt that the German Navy could have held the key to victory.<br /><br />Overall, Clash of Titans is an excellent introduction to the overall role of naval warfare in World War II.lash of Titans provides the reader with a good introduction into the leading naval personalities of the war.

The first time I encountered \\"The Great Gatsby\\" it was as an assignment in a high school English class.  My recent re-read occurred after my son had read it in his high school English class.  The reread brought back memories of a form of academic study from which I have been separated for many years.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is an excellent book in which to study the writer's art.  In this short book the reader can detect a collection of symbolic details which make the story much more than the tale which appears on the surface: the ash heap, as a symbol of the waste of American society; the green light on Daisy's dock, which means so much to Gatsby as a symbol, until he again meets Daisy, when it again becomes, for Gatsby, as for everyone else, just a light.<br /><br />The characters all play their roles in the development of the story.  Shallow figures fill Gatsby's parties, but show their true level of concern for him when they all absent themselves from his funeral.  The class distinctions between Daisy, a true upper class maiden, who can never lower herself to accept Gatsby, the aspirant to a class rank which wealth and parties cannot buy.  Gatsby's source of wealth is hinted at by his association with Meyer Wolfsheim, the gambler who fixed the World Series.  Like others, he will associate with Gatsby in life, but has no time for him in death.<br /><br />The unnatural core of Gatsby's world is illustrated by his act of moving east, rather than the traditional westward migration,  in order to achieve freedom and advancement.<br /><br />Tom and Daisy Buchanan represent old money, which will not accept Gatsby and, in the end, destroys him.<br /><br />Nick Carraway is the one character in the book who develops his own moral sense.  His role as narrator permits us to see Gatsby's world through his eyes.  It is he who sees, and is repelled by, the rotten cores of Gatsby and the worlds in which lives and into which he aspires.  He sees the corruption deep inside Tom and Daisy Buchanan.  Most of all, we see the innate goodness in Tom.  Observing, but not entering Gatsby's world, he is able to understand and judge it.  His final evaluation of Gatsby's world is seen when he abandons it all to return to his native Midwest.<br /><br />As I re-read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" I remembered what I had not liked about it the first time I read it.  The causal acceptance of infidelity seems at odds with what I have always viewed as the ideal as well as the reality.  As one studies the commentaries of this book, with all of its symbolisms, I often wonder if the symbols were really in F. Scott Fitzgerald's mind as he wrote the book, or whether they are constructs of later commentators.  Either way, they give the book a depth which so many others lack.  When my son speaks of other books he reads in English class, he always says \\"It's no Great Gatsby.\\"  The more I think of it, few of novels are.om and Daisy Buchanan.

One night while walking through Lambert Airport in St. Louis, I turned to find myself face to face with Robert Bork, burdened with two suitcases.  At least I knew where I was going. From the look on his face I am not sure that he was as well oriented.  In \\"Slouching Toward Gomorrah\\" I had an encounter with the mind of Robert Bork.  This is one of those books which gradually builds and then pulls it altogether at the end.  When I began the book I was wondering if its thrust would be legal or political.  I could not make up my mind until the last section, at which time I determined what type of a book it is.  It is a book about culture.  It is the voice of an intellectual conservative who knows what is worth saving in American culture and understands the liberal assault being made against it.<br /><br />In the beginning, Bork relates some of his experiences as a conservative in academia.  He describes in detail some of the assaults by the left led by those who substitute feelings for thought and who try to rewrite history to conform it to their preconceived conclusions.<br /><br />Bork then goes on to describe the forces assaulting American culture.  He dates the start of the assault from the Port Huron Statement of 1962 which became the Charter of the radical leftist movement.  He explains that, whereas there was once a common core of beliefs which held American culture together, that core of beliefs has fallen under incessant liberal attack<br /><br />Step by step, Bork goes analyzes the evils arising from the assault on American culture.  He makes a case for censorship of vulgarity in order to prevent a descent into a brutalized and chaotic culture.  He goes on to explain how the rise of crime and illegitimacy resulted from the decline in American culture.  Abortion, euthanasia and assisted suicide are shown for what they really are, \\"Killing for Convenience\\".<br /><br />The assault from radical feminists and on racial questions is deftly exposed.  Bork then proceeds to delve into the effect the leftist assault has had on the churches before examining the wistful leftist hope to remake human nature.<br /><br />Throughout the analysis of the problems of the modern era, Bork examines how the dominance of the left has come, not from converting the masses, but from converting the traditional conservators of the cultural heritage.  He points out that a relatively small proportion of the population, which controls academia, the media and the courts, have used their power to promote the implementation of the leftist agenda.<br /><br />At the end, Bork confronts the crucial questions, of whether democratic government can survive this assault and whether America can avert Gommorah.<br /><br />While recognizing that there is strong justification for pessimism, Bork also sees some reasons for optimism.  On the political front, he sees the attack on democratic government in the form of a Supreme Court which has taken adopted the practice of imposing its wishes as constitutional law.  In so doing, it effectively removes ever larger segments of public policy from the realm of the democratic process.  Shifts in political control have not reversed, or even arrested this trend.  The remedy proposed by Judge Bork is a constitutional amendment which would subject the decisions of the Supreme Court to democratic review.<br /><br />On the wider question of whether or not America can avoid Gommorah, Bork seems to feel that the jury is still out.  Throughout much of the book, he has been telling us how the Left has succeeded in gaining control of the cultural elite.  This power grab has left us with a society in which the shared virtues which made America a unified and successful society have been in headlong retreat for 30 years.  Much like the era of the Barbarian invasions, bastions culture and civilization has been swept away by the waves of assault.  In anearlier era, the destruction of the  Roman culture seemed complete to the contemporary observer.  What only became apparent later was that a remnant of that culture was preserved in the most isolated outposts of monastic life in the west of Ireland.  From islands of culture, such as Skellig Michael, seven miles off the Irish coast, arose a renaissance which restored Western Culture at the end of the Dark Ages.  Despite the apparent victory of the Left in America, Bork sees a similar preservation of traditional values and culture in American society.  He thinks that there are signs of a cultural renaissance occurring in America today.  Whether it will be strong enough to reclaim the battlefield of the recent culture wars remains to be seen.  It is a struggle in which all must play our parts.earlier era, the destruction of the  Roman culture seemed complete to the contemporary observer.

US	48581126	R3NNMTVXF3JUFW	0425170411	281434626	Lindbergh	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A Lonely Life for the Lone Eagle	To this baby-boomer growing up, Charles A. Lindbergh was a shadowy hero about whom little was known.  We knew of his heroic flight across the Atlantic in 1927 and the tragic kidnapping and murder of his son a few years later.  As time went on I came to know that there was some controversy about his stand in the years leading up to World War II.  Occasionally a magazine article would associate his name with some environmental cause, but the human being remained in the shadows of the spectacular dash across the Atlantic.  In this biography, A. Scott Berg brings the man, his times, what the world would make him and the ways he influenced the world all to life.  The book does even more than that, for it gives us a biography, not only of Charles, but also of his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.<br /><br />The book starts with the family background of Charles A. Lindbergh.  The grandson of a prominent member of the Swedish Riksdag and son of a Progressive Minnesota Congressman, Lindbergh was no stranger to the public forums into which he would later delve.  Both his father and grandfather would fall from political favor and seek a modicum of success in regions far from their political bases.  Lindbergh actually got much of his familial support from his maternal family, based in Detroit.  His parents marriage would long exist in name only, a trait which would bear some comparison to Charles and Anne's marriage.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Berg makes the reader clearly aware of the contrasts in Lindbergh's life.  Although the son of a former Congressman who might be expected to have the support of establishment figures, Lindbergh undertook the Trans-Atlantic flight with the credentials of a Midwestern mail pilot, who had primarily flown routes in Missouri and Illinois.  Before the Trans-Atlantic flight he was far from being considered one of America's prominent aviators.  Although seemingly flying out of the mists onto the world stage, he was to become a prominent force in American corporate and public policy debates for the rest of his life.<br /><br />With touchdown in Paris, everything changed for Lindbergh.  He became an instant celebrity on a scale the world had never seen before or since. The press would hound his every movement for years.  This provided Lindbergh with both an opportunity and a curse.  He suddenly became accepted as an expert on any subject on which he might choose to express an opinion.  He used his new persona to promote the causes in which he believed.  At the same time his life became a constant struggle to preserve some degree of privacy and normalcy for himself and his family.<br />Lindbergh's first passion was to promote aviation.  For several year she devoted his energies, both through personal appearances and through corporate and governmental positions, to the advancement of aviation throughout the world.  It was during this period that the tragic death of his first son, Charles, Jr., occurred.<br /><br />As the clouds of war arose over Europe, Lindbergh devoted himself to the crusade to keep America out of war, serving as the most prominent member of the America First movement.  As Berg points out,  Lindbergh was, as were many of his time, motivated, less by a fear of Nazism, than by a fear of Communism.  Lindbergh's main argument was that the greatest tragedy for Western Civilization in general, and the United States in particular, was the establishment of Soviet hegemony over Europe.  He felt that the West needed Germany as a bulwark against Asiatic Russia.  He felt that Germany, based as it was in the Western tradition, would moderate its extremist tendencies more quickly than would the Soviet Union, steeped in its autocratic antecedents.  The history of the 50 years following the triumph of the Soviet Union over Germany goes far toward justifying Lindbergh's fears.  Lindbergh's involvement in national politics and international affairs made turned Lindbergh from the international hero to nationalpariah.  Never again would his public acceptance be what it had been prior to 1940.<br /><br />Throughout his career, Lindbergh dabbled in medical and scientific experiments, culminating in his rather gadfly involvement in the environmental movement.<br />During these years, the Lindbergh marriage was blown by the personalities of Charles and Anne as well as the currents the world circulated around them.  The financial independence resulting from Charles' notoriety and Anne's inheritance permitted each of them to undertake projects without the obligation to commit to a stable lifestyle.  For Charles this meant the freedom to come and go, largely as he pleased, in order to promote the causes to which he was devoted at the time.  This left Anne, who made her own mark as an aviator and a writer, to provide much of the domestic support for the children, often without knowing when Charles would leave or return.  Although Berg presents Charles as having an affection for, interest in and influence over his children, the reader is left with the impression of Charles and Anne as filling more the roles of \\"married singles\\" rather than functioning as a mutually supportive partnership.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent book.  The reader is left with an understanding for the world in which Charles Lindbergh lived and acted.  The development of aviation is seen through the report of his actions.  The story of an important segment of public opinion on the European situation leading up to World War II is well explained.  The postwar Lindbergh, bouncing from project to project without any apparent driving force brings the book to its conclusion.  It is an excellent portrayal of an extraordinary life.pariah.

I began this book with a general understanding of the Mexican War and the hope of obtaining a deeper understanding.  In this I was somewhat disappointed.  As I gathered my thoughts for this review, I began to realize that the book was better than I had initially credited it.<br /><br />For my tastes, this book is a bit long on the minutiae, who attacked in which direction, from which hill, etc.  It does provide some development of the characters involved and the political issues in the background but little about the long-term causes and results of the war.<br /><br />The main battles are well reported, particularly Buena Vista, Vera Cruz and Mexico City.  The role of the Navy and the overland marches to New Mexico are adequately explained.<br /><br />James Polk emerges as a stridently partisan politician who sees partisanship in others but is blinded to his own.  While he accuses Generals Taylor and Scott of taking political gain from victory, he is convinced that his attempts to tarnish their glory is merely an objective action, devoid of political considerations.<br />Generals Taylor and Scott are contrasted.  Zachary Taylor, the dishelved, \\"Old Rough and Ready\\" is almost portrayed as too much of a bungler to be effective as a general or president, and yet he emerged from the war with the Presidential nomination and the White House.<br /><br />Winfield Scott, the pompous \\"Old Fuss and Feathers\\" is portrayed as one who often committed suicide with a goose quill pen.  A highly successful general, he lost the presidential laurels to Taylor, the much more common man.  Although Scott was later nominated for president, his personality was not a win him victory.<br />Santa Anna's place in Mexican history, as a great military planner but poor battlefield general are well documented.<br /><br />Dufour does a good job in distinguishing between the strengths and weaknesses of the volunteer and regular army units. The concept of the war halting for months while the Volunteers, whose enlistments had expired, were discharged, returned to the U.S. and replaced seems incredible, but it was a problem to be repeated in the Civil War.<br /><br />Overall, I hope that this is not the best book on the Mexican War, but if this is the one available, it is a worthwhile read.<br />...ts.

Written by a respected author and grandson of John Quincy Adams, I expected this novel to provide an insight into the political life in the era after the Civil War.  While I did not find that, I did find a political-romantical novel of a very different type from those written today.<br /><br />The novel centers around two main characters.  One is Mrs. Madeleine Lee, a widow who fancies herself a philanthropist, amateur philosopher and socialite,  The other is Midwestern Senator Silas P. Ratcliffe.  Main supporting characters are Sybil Ross, younger sister of Mrs. Lee, and John Carrington, a Confederate veteran and political operative.<br /><br />The minor characters fill out the novel.  The appearance of characters named Clinton and Gore and Ratcliffe's monologue in which he explains the justification in stealing votes to insure victory in an election give the novel a vaguely contemporary flavor.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, we see Ratcliffe pursuing Mrs. Lee, while gradually revealing his own political morals and through his eyes, the shallow figures inhabiting the Halls of Government.  While Ratcliffe is pursuing Mrs. Lee, Carrington and Sybil are conspiring to save her from his grasp.  Ratcliffe's clever political maneuver which ends with himself as Secretary of the Treasury, ostensibly to save the government from the plain Indiana farmer who occupies the White House.<br /><br />I described this as a \\"light\\" novel, because it does not leave a lot to be thought out.  Rather than leaving the reader to draw conclusions from presented facts, the conclusions about the virtues and vices of the characters are pretty much explained in black and white.  I am not sure if this reflects 19th century custom or just Adams' writing style.  I suspect that it reflects the custom to some degree, as it reminds me, to some extent of Benjamin Disraeli's \\"Connsigsby\\"<br />Overall I found this an entertaining, although not intellectually taxing read.  I would recommend it on that basis, but not for a contemporary insight into 19th political life.s an entertaining, although not intellectually taxing read.

It seems that to many Americans any events before the Civil War is lost in the mists of history.  While the Revolution attracts some attention, the War of 1812 is remembered for little more than Old Ironsides and the Battle of New Orleans.<br /><br />Prof. Hickey covers all aspects of this conflict, at least from the American side.  He begins with the disputes which led to the conflict.  The divisions within the United States, both geographical and political, are well explained.  The war created a division between commercial, Federalist New England and the agricultural, Democratic-Republican south and west.  The hardships of the war provided a boost for the declining Federalist Party, but with the return of peace, its decline toward oblivion resumed at a rapid pace.  The economic interests of the various sections are well treated.<br /><br />The war was occasioned by a coalition of interests which combined to overcome the significant opposition.  This was, in fact, probably America's most unpopular War, Vietnam notwithstanding.  The British impressment of seamen, American lust for Canada and resentment resulting from British incitement of Indians, combined to put together a political majority for war.  Some of the maritime issues had led to a series of economic responses over several years prior to the commencement of hostilities.<br /><br />The initial efforts to resolve the issues were a series of shifting and conflicting economic measures, including boycotts and trade restrictions which began before and continued during the war.<br /><br />At the beginning of the war there was a difference of opinion as to whether the war should be fought only at sea or whether a land campaign was also to be prosecuted.  In the end an American naval and privateer offensive at sea was combined with land and lake campaigns.  The American naval victory on Lake Erie provided a major advantage.  The land campaigns against Canada preceded on several fronts.  Fighting occurred in the Michiagn-Western Ontario area, with the Americans making relatively minor gains.  Along the Niagara front, little progress was made by either side.  The American assaults on Lower Canada (Quebec) were unsuccessful.  With the conclusion of the Neapolianic Wars, Britain took the offensive as troops and ships were transferred from Europe.  The British did make significant territorial gains in northern and eastern Maine.  The gains in Maine could have been important in establishing a land route between Montreal and Halifax.  The British had some transient success with its Chesapeake campaign, highlighted by the burning of Washington, although the assault on Baltimore was unsuccessful.  The last British offensive of the war, along the Gulf of Mexico, ended in disaster at the celebrated Battle of New Orleans.<br /><br />The portrait of President Madison as a relatively weak, unsuccessful wartime leader is skillfully painted.  As is the case with other some American leaders, Madison appears to be one whose greatest days occurred before he achieved the office for which he is best remembered.  Madison's role in the drafting and adoption of the Constitution provided major contributions to his country, while his service as Chief Executive was one of the more lackluster performances in that office.<br /><br />America's greatest success in the war occurred, not in the field, but at the peace conference.  This is the exception to Will Rogers' statement that America has never lost a war or won a conference.  Despite representing a government with a smoldering capitol and much of Maine in enemy hands, the negotiators emerged with a return to the prewar borders and a settlement of the maritime issues which had led to the war.<br /><br />After reading this book, one is left with the conclusion that the War of 1812 was probably an unprofitable war for the U.S.  At its end the borders were unchanged and the maritime issues which were resolved would probably have been resolved with the advent of peace in Europe without the necessity of American involvement in the war.  The reader is left with the feeling that the war left America with no lasting collateral benefits to compensate for the loss of life and treasure occasioned by the struggle.<br /><br />While this war may have been an unwise and unprofitable venture, the reading of this book is a profitable venture for anyone interested in this era in American history.ged and the maritime issues which were resolved would probably have been resolved with the advent of peace in Europe without the necessity of American involvement in the war.

Kennedy 1947 to 1963	Books	5	26	28	N	N	A Career, A Society, and How We Have Changed.	Whether you love John F. Kennedy or hate him, \\"Let the Word Go Forth\\" is a rewarding read for anyone interested in the 35th President or the America from which we are not very far removed.  This book consists of excerpts from over 100 speeches made by John F. Kennedy during his political life.  These is not a collection of quotations but a public career as portrayed in largely and totally complete speeches and statements.  In these pages we are reminded of the lofty ideals, the wit and, a bit of the parochial politician which was John F. Kennedy.<br />For me, much of the value in this book lies not in what it tells us of Kennedy, but what it tells us about the country in which he lived.  The things which were said, and which did not need to be said, and the language used tell us of an America different from the one in which we live today.  To illustrate this I will discuss four of the speeches.<br /><br />We begin with the Inaugural Address, probably Kennedy's most famous statement.  The speech, which gave us several remembered lines, the most famous of which is \\"Ask not what your country can do for you,-ask what you can do for your country\\" is most notable for what it does not say.  Read this speech from start to finish and you will find no mention of social security, health care, education, poverty, civil rights, highways or any of the domestic concerns which have held such center stage in recent public debate.  It deals exclusively of foreign policy.  What President since Kennedy would start his administration which such a challenge?<br /><br />The second speech to which I would direct the reader's attention is the address to the Houston Ministerial Alliance on September 12, 1960.  The purpose of the speech was to refute allegations that a Catholic would have a divided loyalty or would be subject to orders from the church hierarchy.  The way in which Kennedy responded to the problem is felt by many to have done a great disservice to Catholic politicians.  It is believed that Kennedy established the standard that, in order to be considered for office, Catholic candidates must establish that their religious beliefs will not be a factor in their decision making process.  At the end of the speech, Kennedy was specifically confronted with a request that he request approval from the Vatican for his statement supporting the separation of church and state.  What politician since then has been confronted with such a question?<br /><br />The third speech to be considered is entitled \\"The City Upon a Hill\\" and was given to the Massachusetts legislature on January 9, 1961.  In this speech Kennedy draws on the history of Massachusetts in establishing the code of conduct for those serving the Commonwealth.  He lists four questions by which public servants will be judged: \\"were we men of courage...were we men of judgement...were we truly men of integrity...were we men of dedication.\\"  As one reads these stirring question with their elaborations, a realization dawns on the reader: There were no women in the Massachusetts legislature in 1961.  I am sure that the wording would be different today.<br /><br />The last speech which I would suggest for consideration is the acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, entitled \\"The Opening of the New Frontier.\\"  I bring this speech up because of the oft stated lament that the public is losing its sense of history, its ability to relate current conditions to conditions of the past in order to help us separate the principle from the pragmatism and the important from the trivial.  In that speech, the nominee tells his listeners: \\"just as historians tell us that Richard I was not fit to fill the shoes of bold Henry II-and that Richard Cromwell was not fit to wear the mantle of his uncle {sic}-they might add in future years that Richard Nixon did not measure to the footsteps of Dwight D. Eisenhower.\\"  Overlooking the fact that Richard Cromwell succeeded his father and not his uncle, what contemporary candidate would trust his listeners to understand the reference to long gone English leaders?  Is it the draining of the general fund of knowledge of our citizens which has lowered the level of our public discourse from the deep, rich speech of the Kennedy era to the shallow sound bites of today?<br /><br />At the conclusion of \\"Let the Word Go Forth\\" one has a greater respect for the communication skills of our 35th President and an appreciation for the things which  we, as a society have gained, and a longing for the things which we have lost.ontemporary candidate would trust his listeners to understand the reference to long gone English leaders?

Although little remembered today, MacArthur was an heroic lieutenant, an influential middle level officer and eventually the leading General in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />The book touches on several aspects of U.S. history.  In reading the story of the General's father, Arthur MacArthur, Sr., the reader gets a peak into the 19th century politics of Wisconsin in particular and the U.S. in general.<br /><br />As a young man MacArthur joined the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry as an adjutant, a position for which his youth initially proved a distinct disadvantage. MacArthur's first glory came with the assault on Missionary Ridge south of Chattanooga on November 25, 1863.  After taking the first level of Confederate rifle pits, which was the objective of the charge, MacArthur led his men on an unordered charge up to the top of the hill, gaining the admiration of all who observed him, from Generals Grant and Sherman on down.<br /><br />In the post war army, MacArthur made two significant contributions.  While commanding at Fort Selden, New Mexico, MacArthur compensated for the absence of a suttler by establishing an enlisted men's canteen, which became the forerunner of the PX system. As a staff officer, he later obtained a change in Army policy which permitted the award of medals to officers.  This change in policy resulted in MacArthur being awarded the Medal of Honor.<br /><br />MacArthur's moment in the sun came with the advent of the Spanish American War.  Surprised by his assignment to the Philippines, MacArthur made the most of the transfer to Asia.  Over a three year period, MacArthur played a major role in the conquest of the Philippines which had begun with the destruction of the Spanish fleet by Adm. Dewey.  The battle began with an defeat of the Spanish troops followed by a long war, first conventional and then guerrilla, against the Philippine Republican troops.<br /><br />After his appointment as Military Governor of the Philippines, MacArthur began to experience difficulties with the civilian officials sent to rule the Islands, primarily William Howard Taft.  The dispute with Taft eventually led to MacArthur's dismissal as Military Governor and his retirement from the army.<br /><br />In telling this story the reader is introduced into the many stages on which the war was played out.  The effect on the political situation in the United States is well developed.  The foreign policy debates incited  by the conquest  of the Islands are explained.  The war on the ground bears an uncanny resemblance to the situation which later Americans found in Vietnam.<br /><br />The introduction of the MacArthur family to Asia is well covered.  The initiation starting with the war in the Philippines continues with the Grand Tour of Asia and is capped during MacArthur's role as military observer to the Russo-Japanese War.<br /><br />This book sheds much light on the development of Arthur's son, Douglas.  In it we read of the desolate western outposts in which Douglas spent his youth, the society into which he was introduced and the role his mother played in his development.  It was on the Grand Tour of Asia that Douglas claimed to have learned to understand the Asian mind.  Douglas' familiarity with Asia would come to play a role in his influential involvement in American policy toward Asia in the middle of the 20th Century.  The similarities in the careers of both Arthur and Douglas are laid before the reader.  At the time of the writing of the book, the only Father-Son Medal of Honor winners, both would have their careers marred by major conflicts with civilian superiors and would end their days in virtual exile from the services to which they had devoted most of their lives.<br /><br />The General's General is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in the story of this remarkable man and in the Army's role in U.S.history the Civil War through the period before World War I.history the Civil War through the period before World War I.	2000-12-02

The main theme of the work is that the Western tradition of liberal education is being undermined by efforts to meet the demands for group representation in curriculum, student bodies and faculty appointments.  He points out that, whereas the traditional notion of the university saw it as a forum for an open exchange of ideas, the current reality is a venue in which the ultimate goal is not truth arrived at through study and exchange, but dictated by faculty radicals in accord with their own political beliefs.<br /><br />To support his thesis, D'Souza provides a series of cases studies of incidents at leading universities across the U.S.  He begins with an report of the admissions policy at Berkeley which, at the time of his writing, admitted students competitively within racial groups, each of which is entitled to a percentage of the student body.  The result of this is different standards for admission by members of various ethnic groups.  He then proceeds to review the demands for multiculturalism, which leads to the abandonment of traditional classics to make room for works of women and contributions from non-western traditions.  In doing this works whose value have been tested over decades or centuries are supplanted by clearly inferior works only because they represent contributions by members of underrepresented groups..  In faculty selection, standards have been established to ensure that certain groups are represented in various numbers in the academic departments.  This creates both intellectual and practical problems.  Whereas liberal education teaches students to search for universal standards of judgment which transcend particularities of race, gender and culture, illiberal education teaches a provincialism in which every group is encouraged to have its own provincial world view, which restricts the ability find commonality among all mankind.  The practical problem is that the quotas often call for numbers of minority professors exceeding the pool of qualified contenders.<br /><br />D'Souza concludes this book with three modest proposals.  He proposes a program of Non-Racial Affirmative Action, which would permit the admission students who appear to possess academic potential not reflected in their academic records, rather than basing standards on group membership.  The second suggestion is for Choice Without Separatism.  Under this proposal, organizations open only to members of ethnic groups not would encouraged, but those promoting ideas, which may be predominately of interest to members of particular ethnic groups would be encourage, but on a non-exclusive basis.  The third proposal is for a curriculum searching for Equality and Classics.  Rather than dismissing classical works on the basis that they represent a limited world view, they should be studied for the principals of equality which many contain and which often played a role in their selection as classics.<br />The weakness of Illiberal Education is that it often seems to be a merely collection of anecdotes which leave the reader wondering whether they really represent the reality of contemporary higher education or whether they merely reflect the most extreme aberrations.  for many, including prospective college parents such as myself, this is an interesting study of disturbing trends in higher education.y among all mankind.

Bannon	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An Irish Cleric Fighting for Dixie	The Confederacy's Fighting Chaplain, Father John B. Bannon by Phillip Thomas Tucker, is an excellent biography and Civil War History. The book gives the background of Father Bannon, beginning with his education in Ireland and his service in St. Louis. The conflicts which were tearing St. Louis, as well as the nation, apart are well reflected in the life of Bannon as he was making his decision as to how to respond to the gathering storm. Not limiting his narrative to a mere recitation of facts, Tucker acquaints the reader with the factors working on, and the thoughts going on within Bannon's mind which led him to his conclusion that the Confederacy represented the cause of freedom and Christian civilization in America. The chapters covering Bannon's service as chaplain for the First Missouri Confederate Brigade skillfully blend the details of the chaplain's life with the greater history of the War in general. The final section of the book relates Bannon's unique service as a diplomatic agent on behalf of the Confederacy and his role as personal emissary from President Davis to Pope Pius IX. Davis had asked Bannon to undertake a mission to Ireland to attempt to dissuade Irish from enlisting in the Union Army. It was Bannon's initiative to undertake the overture which almost resulted in recognition of the Confederacy by the Vatican. The unique intertwining of Bannon's roles as chaplain and diplomat within the larger story in which he played a part, make this a very worthwhile addition to the Civil War literature	2000-10-28

Ford provides a very frank and open view into the one-time First Family of America. The first 123 pages provides Ford's life story until he enters the presidency. The remainder of the book covers the Ford Administration. For one who lived through the Ford years, the book provides a reminder of the key stories of the day as well as their presentation from the Presidential perspective. One of the most endearing features of this book is President Ford's candor. In commenting on events and personalities with which he was involved he is not constrained by an aversion to giving offense. Some of his comments are more in the nature of what one would expect to hear in your own family room, rather than in the autobiography of a national politician. Illustrative of such snippets are his reaction when he heard of Spiro Agnew being tapped for Vice-President (&quot;I shook my head in disbelief.&quot;) and his reaction to Nixon's resignation speech: &quot;at the end I was convinced that Nixon was out of touch with reality. The fact that he was linking his resignation to the loss of his Congressional base shocked me and disturbs me still.&quot; My one disappointment in this book is the sparse treatment of his Congressional career. One would think that Ford's long service in the House and years as minority leader would provide a basis for a book of its own. He could have provided a valuable insight into some of the major legislative battles of the fifties through the early seventies. He chose, however, only to mention those incidents which were of particular importance to his family life or career. Overall, A Time To Heal is a very interesting book which is well worth the reading.	2000-10-28

Set in late nineteenth century Paris, it combines a love story with the struggle between a new, wealthy American and an old, traditional French family over the lovely daughter of the family.<br /><br />The story involves Christopher Newman, a wealthy American businessman, during the Paris portion of his European tour.  Romance seems be a large part of what he is looking for.  The first suggestion that he may have found it occurs in his encounter with the artist, Noemie Nioche.  This turns out to be merely a passing fancy.  Things get more serious when his American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Tristan put him in contact with an attractive young widow, Claire de Cintre.<br /><br />Madame de Cintre, nee Bellegarde, whose first marriage had been arranged to an elderly nobleman who gave her a title, but little else.  Upon meeting Newman, both seem to find what they are looking for in the world of romance.  As the story develops it becomes clear that it is sufficient for Newman to win Claire but that he must also win over her family, which consisted of her mother, Madame de Bellegarde and her brother, Urbaine, the Marquis de Bellegarde.<br />The House of Bellegarde was full of pride and tradition, but short of money.  As the Bellegardes size up Newman, it becomes obvious that they are weighing the sale of their pride for Newman's money.  Ultimately they reach their decision.  In their last meeting, Claire informed Newman of that she was to become a nun.  Although shocked, Newman could not persuade Claire to break free of her family's rule and breath the free air which comes so naturally to an American.<br /><br />Given one piece of evidence, Newman attempts to recover Claire back through blackmail. When the Bellegardes refuse to submit, Newman destroys his evidence.  Up to the very end, the reader is left hoping for the happy ending, but he hopes in vain.<br /><br />For the romantic, this book provides an inspiring love story.  For the historian, it provides a glimpse into the life of Nineteenth Century Aristocracy on two continents.  For the lover of freedom, it provides a struggle between New World freedom and individuality and Old World tradition and bonds of consanguinity.

The book was written just after LaFollette had concluded his campaign for  the 1912 Republican Presidential Nomination. This spirited pronouncement of  the Progressive program can be divided into two parts. The first part deals  with the political struggles and accomplishments which LaFollette made  during his career in Wisconsin state politics, concluding with his service  as Governor. In the section, LaFollette tells the story of his fight  against machine politics to achieve a more open political process and the  struggle against the representatives of the railroads in his effort to  bring the lines into the tax system on a par with other taxpayers. Those  goals having been accomplished, LaFollette moved on to achieve state  regulation of railroad rates. The second section of the book deals with his  involvement on the national political scene. This covers the issues with  which LaFollette was interested, particularly railroad regulation. The last  parts of the book is devoted to a report of LaFollette's unsuccessful bid  for the 1912 Republican Presidential nomination, won by President William  Howard Taft. Toward the end the book turns into an attack on the record of  Theodore Roosevelt, who had effectively ended LaFollette's bid for the  Presidency when he entered the 1912 race by usurping LaFollette's position  as the bearer of the Progressive banner. LaFollette engages in an  examination of Roosevelt's record to establish the point that Roosevelt was  never a true Progressive. The main difference seems to be that LaFollette  was unwilling to compromise on the Progressive agenda, willing to fight  indefinitely for victory, whereas Roosevelt is depicted as willing to  espouse the Progressive agenda and then agree to political compromises  which were not to LaFollette's satisfaction. The conclusion of the book  calls for the preservation of the Progressive movement in the Republican  Party and blasts Theodore Roosevelt for splitting the movement by the  creation of the Progressive Party. Ironically, LaFollette would bolt the  GOP to form a Progressive Party to support his own Presidential bid twelve  years later. Although the details may be a bit boring for the general  reader, LaFollette's Autobiography is an interesting read for anyone  interested in LaFollette or the Progressive Era.for the preservation of the Progressive movement in the Republican  Party and blasts Theodore Roosevelt for splitting the movement by the  creation of the Progressive Party.

What little  reference there is to naval actions tends to be in the nature of trivia,  such as the first submarine to sink a ship (C.S.S. R. L. Huntley), the  first battle of ironclads in the Western World, the Monitor and Virginia  (Merrimack) or songs about the daring Confederate raider, Alabama.  As  interesting as these anecdotes are, they fail to tell the true story of the  important part that naval forces played in the Union conquest of the  Confederacy.  One seeking an understanding of the significance of the naval  forces in the Civil War can find it in By Sea and By River: The Naval  History of the Civil War  by Bern Anderson.  Anderson provides the reader  with an excellent overview of naval aspects of the war.<br /><br />The Union war  plans called for conquest of the Confederacy by dividing the South and  preventing the importation of needed manufactured goods from Europe.  Despite attention directed toward the land war. the war was really decided  in the West and along the Confederate coastlines.  In these two theatres  the Union Navy played a crucial role which is often overlooked by leading  to the division and economic strangulation of the South.<br /><br />The division of  the Confederacy was achieved by two major thrusts, one down the Mississippi  River and another through Kentucky, Tennessee and on to Atlanta,  culminating in Sherman's March to the Sea.  The thrust down the Mississippi  involved significant naval action.  The economic strangulation of the  Confederacy, was achieved by the naval blockade.<br /><br />The U.S. Navy on the  western rivers was placed under the command of Captain Andrew H. Foote in  September, 1861.  In the beginning he was lacking only two requirements of  a successful navy, boats and sailors.  The shortage of boats was solved by  purchases from the Eads Boatworks of St. Louis, founded by engineer James  B. Eads, who is primarily remembered for building the Eads Bridge at St.  Louis.  The shortage of sailors was greater challenge.  Although provided  with sufficient officers, Foote was left to his own devices to recruit  enlisted men.  He finally achieved some success in recruiting sailors in  the Great Lakes region.  With the fleet assembled, Foote was ready to join  General Grant in the planning and execution of the thrust down the  Mississippi and other western rivers.<br />In November, 1861 Grant began  moving against Confederate strongholds in Kentucky, transported by river  and supported by naval gunboats.  Grant's first great conquest in Southern  territory was the conquest of Fort Henry, Tennessee on February 6, 1862.  The attack was commenced by four gunboats under the command of Capt. Foote.  The plan was for troops under Grant's command to cut off the fort from the  rear while it was being bombarded from the river.  Muddy roads and high  water prevented Grant from cutting off the troops sent from Fort Henry to  Fort Donelson.  At 1:50, after less than two hours of naval bombardment,  the fort surrendered.  Grants troops then arrived to take possession.<br /><br />The next Fort attacked was Fort Donelson on February 14.  The fort  yielded to a combination of bombardment by four gunboats and assault of  17,000 troops under Grant's command on February 15.<br /><br />Action next shifted  to the Middle Mississippi from March to June, 1862.  The first Confederate  obstacle encountered was Island No. 10, the tenth island south of Cairo.  It surrendered on April 6, 1862 after a spectacular nighttime naval  bombardment and a land assault.  Similar methods were successful at Fort  Pillow and Memphis.  Vicksburg would fall to a land based siege and a naval  bombardment from both river and ocean based vessels.<br /><br />The main mission of  the ocean going Navy was to enforce the blockade.  This was accomplished by  interception of blockade runners and the capture of ports.  In his book,  Anderson does a fine job of relating both the strategy behind the actions  and details about the actions themselves.  The actual nature of blockade  running actions, involving the shallow draft runners against the deeper  water naval vessels is described.  The actions against port cities often  involved a joint naval bombardment with land assault, the combination which  was successful along the western rivers and in later wars.  Prominent among  these assaults were the captures of Charleston, New Orleans and forts  guarding the entrance to Mobile Bay.  The final assault upon Fort Fisher  was a fitting conclusion to the campaigns of naval-land assaults.  General  Lee had predicted that his army could not hold out if supplies coming  through Fort Fisher were cut.  Within three months after the fall of Fort  Fisher, the Army of Northern Virginia was compelled to yield to  overwhelming numbers and resources.<br /><br />By Sea and By River also includes  analysis of the effects of the campaigns on other aspects of the war.  The  stories of the Confederate raiders are told, both in their own rights, as  well as the effect that they had on Northern commerce and the obligation  they created on the Union Navy to reassign ships from blockade duty to  raider chasing.  The effect of the raiders and the blockade on relations  with foreign nations, with particular regard to the Confederate attempts to  obtain recognition and aid are discussed.<br /><br />By Sea and By River provides  the reader with a fine understanding of this most significant, but often  overlooked part of a most studied war.s and the capture of ports.

Without going into detail which would bore the amateur historian, Anderson provides the reader  wth an excellent overview of Naval aspects of the war.<br /><br />This book covers  the major naval theatres of the war.  In the war on the western rivers the  Union Navy played a major role in support of the Army attacks along the  rivers, such as at Forts Henry and Donelson and Vicksburg.  The assault on  Island Number Ten in the Mississipi River makes an interesting read.<br /><br />Much attention is directed toward the Blockade, which was, probably, the  major naval contribution to the war.  All aspects of the blockade are  examined.  Anderson explains the purpose of the blockade and its role as  one of the major methods of strangling the South economically.  He details  the amphibious operations and how they fit into the blockade.  In  opposition to the blockade Confederate iron-clad rams had spectacular  moments of success but were of little overall significance. The book  explains the efforts and limitations of blockade runners and Confederate  raiders.  The diplomatic entanglements occasioned by the blockade and  raiders are presented from all sides.<br /><br />At the conclusion, Anderson sums up  the significance of the naval aspect of the war, a significance which many  Civil War students will overlook.  \\"By Sea and by River\\" is an  excellent introduction to a very important and, perhaps, decisive, aspect  of the Civil War.	1999-01-03
US	48581126	R1KTKTGTRGFZCN	0895267454	376346755	Right from the Beginning	Books	4	17	17	N	N	A Book to make you stand up and cheer!	&quot;Right from the Beginning&quot; is a very interesting, easy read.  It is, primarily, a personal, rather than a political, autobiography of Pat Buchanan.  Those seeking an insight into the Nixon or Reagan White Houses  will be disappointed.  Those searching for an understanding of what makes  Pat Buchanan the man that he is will be very satisfied.  The book is, for  the most part, a series of personal and family antidotes which Pat uses to  tell the story of how he got to where he was in 1990.  Here and there he  will interrupt the anrrative to insert a philosophical statement about  life, religion or politics. To this St. Louisian who grew up in the  Catholic school system a few years after Pat, there is much which seems  familiar.  For me, this book took the emotions on a roller coaster ride.  The first section, dealing with his grade school years, is my favorite part  of the book.  In it Pat records the environment in which we lived, the  things we were taught and the lasting beliefs which we still hold.  The  second section, dealing with his high school and college years records a  lot of pranks and activities which are not part of my experience and which  I did not find to be very enjoyable.  In the third section, dealing with  his career, my enthusiasm rebounded, in part because of the references to  places and people in St. Louis. The greatest value in this book is the  understanding it gives one of Pat Buchanan.  Many public figures are hidden  behind the facades created by their managers.  We often have difficulty  understanding what their core values are.  The Pat Buchanan we see is Pat  Buchanan.  &quot;Right From the Beginning&quot; shows us what makes the Pat  Buchanan we see and admire.	1998-12-28

Coningsby is an interesting political-romantic novel set in early nineteenth century England.  In much of the first part of the book, Disreali introduces the main characters and the political and social background against which the action in the later parts of the book will be played.  In this book Disraeli covers several topics.  He explains the state of parliamentary politics of the day and the changing social and political situations of the nobility and the rising manufacturing class.  As the title character, Coningsby, develops his political philosophy, Disraeli gives an insight into his own core political beliefs.  Through Sidonia, one of his main characters, Disreali makes a pitch for the rights of Jews, a group to which Disraeli is linked by consangunity, though not be religion.  To make it all entertaining, Disraeli takes Coningsby and his lover through a long and chaste romantic quest, in which they finally overcome the obstacles placed in their way by their families.  The book, ultimately, provides a triumph of love over hatred and pettiness.<br /><br />The strong points of this book are its pleasant story line and the ability to tell a romantic and political tale without including the moral failings, without which so many modern authors seem incapable of expressing themselves.  The weak points are found in its age and storybook ending.  The repeated references to so many details of political life of his day and the simililarities of characters to prominent people, which may have been amusing to the readers of his day, are lost on most contemporary readers.  The ending, in which all the injustices inflicted on Coningsby by petty people around him are reversed through acts of self-sacrifice which set the world right, introduces a sense of fantasy which makes the book seem just a bit too much to believe.  Overall this book is a worthwhile read	1997-08-31
