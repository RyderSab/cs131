Well, I bought all the four books that go with the Green Tradition, they are: Green Witchcraft, Green Witchcraft II, Green Witchcraft III, and Green Magic. I'll have to say that I was kind of dissapointed in this book. It wasn't only Witchcraft, it had Wiccan things thrown in, but since I'm Wiccan, it wasn't a too much of a problem. She has some good memories of her childhood, and her magickal experiences. There is also lots of her bias views thrown in, and I agree with some of them. The &quot;rules&quot; that her mother thought her are very ethical, and they make sense.<br />To be honest, I didn't read the part where she gives rituals for the Sabbats, and the Esbats. They, in my mind, created the word &quot;boring,&quot; plus, the bold lettering didn't help either. Also, the title includes &quot;Fairy Lore,&quot; well, from what I've seen, there are bearly two pages on faeries and their lore.<br />So, to conclude my little review, I think that you can do without this book, but the other three seem good, I especially like Green Witchcraft III: The Manual. Green Witchcraft II seemed promising since I've chosen to work with Hecate (Hekate), but all it has are some meditations and divination, which I don't have time for right now. Green Magic is a very good book in my opinion, because it deals with energy manupulation.<br />While in this book she seemed to be doing something with Ceremonial Magick, in the other three, it seems like she's left that practice to focus more on the &quot;Green&quot; Craft. Thats all for my review of this book!<br />-Ater	2003-02-14

This is actually a great book for teens who are interested in magick and spells. This book is a whole guide on making your own spells, and it even gives you chants if you can't write some yourself! I also liked it because the author recommended teens interested in Wicca to read \\"The Real Witches' Handbook\\" by Kate West. I liked that because I think it's a great book, and because no one else recommended it. <br />My favorite part was about candle burning. I liked it because Gwinevere talked about how you should always be safe, and provided safe tips for those who are allowed to burn candles (unlike me). The book itself was made to look \\"witchy,\\" and is full of wonderful illustrations to keep you looking. The one thing I didn't like was that it as too short (I finished it quickly after I got it), but she said that she wanted it to be that way, and I see why, and agree that if it was longer, it might have not been so \\"short and sweet.\\" The other thing I did't like was that she included a section on Wicca, and this boook is called \\"SpellCraft for Teens.\\" I think that the readers who were just interested in magick, or were just Witches, might have not liked that. But, since I'm Wiccan, I had no problem with it. This is a great book, that's worth looking through! <br />-Ater	2002-10-27

(This is her BEST book so far.) If you are too tiered to e-mail me, then see my other reviews by clicking on my name. <br />I am so glad that they had this book in the library, which stopped be from buying it! Now lets say some good stuff about this book before I start to bash it.The things I liked were: I liked the chapters on ritual and magick, I also liked the spells, but I feel that spells shouldn't be given to begginers, and it's much better if you write your own.<br />The things I didn't like were: I didn't like her \\"Real Witches DO...Real Witches DON'T\\" section--it was VERY laughable. First of all who is to say what real Witches do. (It would be better if she used \\"Wiccans\\", but I guess she sees them as same things) In that section she kept saying how real Witches don't use blood in their rituals. But, some of them do. Some Witches (non-Wiccan) use their own blood to seal their spells, which majes their magick much more stronger--a good example of that would be \\"Embracing the Moon\\" by Yasmine Galenorn. If she just called it \\"Real Wiccans DO...Real Wiccans DON'T\\" Then I wouldn't have a problem with it. The coment she said about magick was also her own belief. She said something like \\"magick can not exist/work without a belief in a Divine (God)\\" This statment is tottaly wrong because magick can work without a belief in any God or Goddess, magick works by you believeing in it and yourself. And one more thing, you can NOT be a Wiccan and a Christian--you can practice magick and be a Christian, but Christianity and Wicca don't go together. I gave this book 3 stars because I'm a very genorous person, but I do wish that Silver would say in the introduction to teens that these are her opinions and her beliefs and that there are many authors out there who think differently. Also about the angels. Well, I don't work with angels because they were created by Christianity and there is no other proof that someone else created them, and using these beings in magick is kind of risky because they are not all that \\"fluffy.\\" Angels are just another little thing that we Wiccans are getting laughed at and called \\"fluffy-bunnies.\\" Wiccans believeing in angels is very new (like the fluffsters of New Age), and when Gardner created Wicca about 50 years ago, he didn't have angels in his closet. (Also, Gardner spelled Wicca like this: \\"Wica\\"...try to find some of his books.)<br />All in all I would suggest that you better buy a few Wicca 101 books then this one. \\"The Craft\\" by Dorothy Morrison is a good one. And if you hear someone say \\"Ms. RavenWolf is like a cult leader, or something\\" then go to her website (remodeled) and read the things about \\"Teen Witch\\" and \\"Teen Witch Kit\\" to see why. I do believe that this author has some good book (I reviewed them here on Amazon.com), and I do plan to buy her new book \\"The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the Solitary Witch\\" (see her website for more information.)<br />I'm done ranting now. You are better off with Wicca 101 books (that's how I started), even if they are for adults, they can help a lot.	2002-08-28

Although it focuses more on magick--it still has some good information for begginers. I did like the first chapter and the chapters on the tools, and Wiccan celebrations. I also liked the chapter on meditation. All in all, a great book for begginers. Also, I wouldn't recommend that you waste your money on \\"The Craft Companion\\", it just isn't worth the money--\\"Everyday Magic\\" by the same author is a good one.	2002-08-26

I am a very eclectic Wicca, and this book was perfect for me. Although the author is not Wiccan, and there were some things in there that were against the Wiccan \\"rules\\", I would still do them is a situation like that arose. This book has no fluff or bluff in it, and it's the best book that Llewellyn has ever published. From reading this book I felt better for working with Goddess Hecate and was glad that Yasmine called the Dark Goddesses to help bring justice when someone has been raped, abused, etc. No, you won't find anything \\"New Agey\\" in it, Yasmine is a person who uses her common sense, and that is why I decided that she is my favorite author. Now I'm going to talk about this book.<br />Part one is called \\"Ritual Preparation.\\" It has all the basic things for you need to start working magick, I liked that she had a whole cahpter on visualization and how to do it, unlike other books that say \\"visualize an apple, that is how we do it, visualize it.\\" There is also a cahpter on rising power that I also liked. It has all you need.<br />Part two is called \\"Spellcraft.\\" This part was so common sense that I loved it. I liked her personal stories as well. This part has it all and the spells couldn't have been written better. Many of her spells and rituals ask for oils that she has recepies to in the book--I would just use something else or a normal oil (everything can become magickal!) <br />Part three is called \\"Shadow Work.\\" In this section I liked the shapeshifting/totem animal cahpter and the chapter on faerie magick, the chapters on the Goddess and the God were very good, too. I liked how she said that faeries weren't all light and fluffy. All in all, this is a must have for all, no matter what magickal path you follow, it will be useful.<br />If you want to know more about her other and future books, then visit her site.

This was a great book on magick and it had a great chapter on chakara work. It also had a chapter on meditation, which was also very helpfull for most part. I also enjoyed the chapter on the elements because I practice natural magick and this book presented helpful information and techniques.<br />Now, the things I didn't like about it. First, it had a chapter on the Sabbats and it included rituals for the Sabbats. That is my problem, the rituals. The rituals were written for a small coven and were very easy to &quot;adept&quot; for the Solitary Witches, but then the rituals lost all meaning because they were already too simple. I don't understand why authors give rituals for covens and not solitaries. I think it's much easyer for a coven to adept solitary rituals because there is more of them and they can work together, unlike the Solitary Witch who works alone. For solitary rituals for the Sabbats and other celebrations, I would recommend that you read &quot;The Wiccan Book of Ceremonies and Rituals&quot; by Patricia Telesco.<br />Second, and last problem that I have with this book is the techniques for enchancing visualization. It's simple, they don't work. If you have a problem like I did in visualizing things, I would recommend that you read &quot;Embracing the Moon&quot; by Yasmine Galenorn. It has a great chapter on visualization that helped me with practicing magick. <br />I hope this review helped you.	2002-07-04

After all can you belive those reviewers who \\"hate\\" her books and they have reviewed them all, I think that only shows us that they don't even read the books they review.<br />To say more about the book, here are some things you should know.

This section talks about how to begin practicing Wicca and it has some good \\"rules\\" that you might want to follow. Then it has a chapter on the words that are used in the Craft. Then it has a chapters on religion and science, the Sabbats and Esbats, and then finally it has a chapter on different Gods and Goddesses.<br />Section two is called \\"Building Shadows\\". This secton has all things about visuslization, meditation, sacred space, cleansing and charging, and how to find your magickal name. It also has a chapter on how to record things in your BoS.<br />Section three is called \\"Performing Shadows\\". This secton has alll things about magick, ritual, divination, going to Pagan festivals and talking to other Pagans, gems, herbs, and healing magick. It also has a chapter on spellcasting.<br />Section four is called \\"Challenging Shadows\\". This section has chapters on, Summerland, coming out of the closet, astral projection and other things that go with \\"Mind Power\\". This book also has good appendixes on history of the Craft, Pagan newsletters, and Pagan/Wiccan press alliance.

If you've read the first book, then this book is good for you.<br />When it comes to magick, he is GREAT. When it comes to Wicca, not so great. Also, I don't like how he says \\"if you do anything that's only good for you, you are following the left hand path.\\" What? What's this \\"left-hand\\" path all about?	2002-07-03
US	37703331	RB90TFFI1XAPE	156718720X	593142486	American Folk Magick	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Very Usefull	I don't know if this is real Pow-Wow magick, but I like it and it's very usefull. If you are looking for a book that has some history and usefull spells for healing, protection, and banishing, then this book is good for you.<br />This book is for both Wiccans and Christans, but I don't think I will be using the Psalm magick presented in this book. All in all, this is a great book to have. The only thing that I didn't like was that she included a \\"Hunting Deer\\" spell. I am a vegeterian and even if I weren't I wouldn't go and kill deer. Although I am glad to hear that her husband hunts deer for food and not a trophy on the wall.	2002-07-03

I am so suprised that other reviewers didn't menton the \\"bad\\" things about this inaccurate and useless book.<br />First, this book was useless for teens that don't have Wiccan parents. The spells in the book ask for hard-to-find and expensive ingrediants (i.e. stones, crystals, oils, herbs), unless you have an occult shop near you and alot of money to spend.<br />Second, this book has tables of deities and their associations, some of the deities belong to the Christan religion (i.e. jesus, mary), and why is that? Do Witches/Wiccans worship jesus? I think NOT! Although this book has some good information about the Sabbats, I think that you could get better information about them in other books.<br />Third, this book says that Wicca is an ancient religion. I think NOT, Wicca is only about 50 or so years old, and yes I know that it's based on the beliefs of pre-Christan religions like Paganism. I think that the author should read her own \\"Recommended Reading\\" list. Also, that book called \\"Creative Visualization\\" by Shakti Gawain in the \\"Recommended Reading\\" list is not about visualizing in magick, but it's a \\"self-help book.<br />Well, I hope that this review helps you. This is really a useless book for teenage Witches/Wiccans who's parents might not want them burning sage and buying expensive stones, crystals, oils, herbs, etc. I also think that it's better if you write your own spells. If you raelly want a spellbook here are three books I reccomend. \\"Earth Power\\" by Scott Cunnungham, \\"Earth, Air, Fire, & Water\\" by Scott Cunningham, and \\"Everyday Magic\\" by Dorothy Morrison.	2002-07-03

This book is exellent for begginers in magick, but if you are not a begginer it would be useless. When I read this book I wasn't a begginer, but I still liked it because it's the \\"best\\" begginers guide out there.<br />If you are looking for a start in magick, then this small and cheap  book is for you. It is really cheap for the information that it offers. I wish this was the first book I read on magick. Amber k is the only author who managed to do it in the easy-to-understand manner. Buy this book if you are a begginer.	2002-07-03

Kate West is a very down-to-earth Witch, and her writing is the same. If you want to give this book to your parents so they could understand that Wicca/Witchcraft is not evil, then please do.<br />The one of the best and interesting chapters was the one about the Sabbats. All in all, this is a great begginers book.	2002-07-03
