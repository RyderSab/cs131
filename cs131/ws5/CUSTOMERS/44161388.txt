Generally, I felt that his comcepts were better then his delivery.  However, that ends with \\"Sand Storm\\" both the concept and the delivery were superb.  If you are looking to \\"veg out\\" for a few hours you most certainly could do alot worse then \\"Sand Storm\\"	2004-08-27
US	44161388	R25O35DAIXV9V2	0765307057	380470964	Midnight Mass	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Another Strong Entry	Again Wilson wrote a novel that calls to me.  Unfortunately, like so many readers who have the time to read a book in one sitting I must read in 10-15 minute increments.  So, a book must immediately transport me to another world.  Wilson always delivers and Midnight Mass is no exception.	2004-06-16
US	44161388	R2VWOD0ICMJ5CN	0515087335	972332907	The Touch	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Not a Horror Novel	This is a book of suspense not horror.  And like most of Wilson's books his character development is exceptional.  I even recommend it to my wife who doesn't like horror novels.  How this book fits into the Adversary Cycle I havent't a clue.  So I guess I'll just have to read the final three to find out.  A great book for a &quot;dark and stormy night&quot;.	2004-05-24

Especially good in the procedures of police work and of course Jesse screwed up love life.  He really needs to get over his ex-wife.  As with the previous Jesse novels each one gives us new insight into Jesse life.<br />So while Spenser will always be my favorite Jesse is getting closing the gap.	2003-10-18

The strength of his previous novels were in the Joe Pickett's character, his love of his family and the balance in which the author presents both sides of an issue.<br />In this book he (Box) goes overboard in presenting the federal government officials as \\"evil\\".  And Pickett no longer does \\"the right thing\\" in the end.<br />Still most of the thing that made the two previous Joe Pickett novels \\"5\\"s are still there.  His family, great descriptions of an uncompromising country and a story that will keep you glued to your seat.<br />So, do as I did. Read this book.	2003-06-24

But, I realize giving a small person a little power can, and often does, create a monster.  As happens in this story.<BR>  <BR>So, having said that the author again has drawn his main characters so well, they can become part of your life, and become \\"friends\\" that visits once a year.<br />So, if you haven't yet discovered C.J. Box you are in for a treat.  If you have here's another outstanding story for you to enjoy.<br />P.S. For those who find Nate Romanowski and interesting character rumor has it that he will appear in later Pickett novels and may be the center piece of his own.	2003-06-13

Why the difference, it's easy I would never read through ALL the explanations of the technilogy, but listening to it on tape requires no thought.  It just sort of flows.<br />Interesting story.  Main character is a bit card board, but in all well worth the LISTENING to.	2003-01-23

This could be the best yet.<br />Without giving away the plot.  I don't like reviewers that tell you half the story.  Let's just say that Jack's life is getting more complicated.<br />The one hint I'll give is there appears to be 1 1/2 to 2 years in time line before the grand finale.  So, how many books is that?  I hope its a bunch.<br />I'll be there for every one of them!!!!!!!!!!!!	2002-12-03

The ending cost her a point, weak is being very polite.  Without spoiling it for anyone.  She could have had the same ending on page 50 just as well as page 300.  But, of course we wouldn't have destroyed at least 2 cars would we?<br />Oh well, it was still FUN.  Just work a little harder on the ending. Ok.	2002-07-16

Even though Chosen Prey has a satisfactory ending Mortal Prey is really an extention of the the first book.  Even if you have previously read Chosen Prey (As I had) go back and read it again.  They just flow together.<br />I'll let the other reviewers tell you about the story. Let me just say they are both great novels and there are far worst ways to spend an afternoon.	2002-06-09

Unlike most books of this type it doesn't deal with the hunted and the hunter.  But, with two hunters.

My only real complaint about these books is well never see Hawk.	2001-10-22
