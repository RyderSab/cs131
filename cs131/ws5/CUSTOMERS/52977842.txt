I wasn't in a hurry to read Whirlwind, about Iran, however, this turned out to be a great novel.  It was interesting, educational, emotional and moved along for such a large book.  Whirlwind may not be Clavell's best  book, but it is up there.  I love the way he weaves parts of all his prior  novels into this one, from Nobel House to Tai-Pan and even King Rat.  It is  a shame that Clavell died and there will not be any more of this great  Asian saga.  All I can say about the book is WOW....I am glad I live here  and not there, what a different culture and place.	1999-03-29

EVEN with the attempt of a heavy story, this book fails to envoke emotion on a subject that deserves a harder look.  typical Grisham, the writing flows, is easy to follow and can be finished during dinner.  The book  builds up and but doesn't have a major conclusion, not a lot of excitement  and no empathy for the main character.  In The Firm, my heart was racing,  in the The Street Lawyer-nothing.  It is not a bad book and I will probably  continue to read his novels, but this is one of his weaker stories.	1999-02-08

Mila 18 can make you hate and runs the gammet on emotions.  <br />It  is important and we have all heard it before that we never forget, so that  we never repeat.

I feel so ignorant not knowing the history of  ireland and the battles that have gone on for hundreds of years.  This book  certainly shed light on that.  If you are a fan of historical fiction this  is  a must, but the continuing theme in history is that &quot;every society  at one time has been either the victum or victor&quot;.  Each society finds  a way to punish, cripple and degrad others that are weaker.  Will this ever  end? probably not, it seems to be human nature.  The question is, Why do we  persist in keeping others down and insisting that our way is the best and  only way.	1998-09-14

This book  is basically a sequel to tai-pan, 20 years later.  The continuing feud between the Struans and Brocks, the introduction of the hag and Gornt's who we read about in Noble House.  With every Clavell novel you learn about times, places and people, Gai-Jin is set in Japan in 1862.   Gai-Jin is another grand historical novel with tremendous character development and insight to the Japanese. There are also some interesting references to the U.S. civil war.  Although I liked the book, I must admit I was a little disappointed and felt the book could have cut out 300 pages.  A must for fans of Clavell, fourth in line for those that haven't read his other masterpieces	1997-04-03

It did not have all the blood and guts that i was expecting, nor did i find myself overly attached to any of the characters.  Mario Puzo has tremendous insight and knowledge into Las Vegas, the movie industry and the mob.  This book is slated to be a mini-series on cbs in may.  my prediction, one of the most successful and highest rated of all time.	1997-02-28

I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY, IF THE BOY WANTS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND DOESN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT, HE JUST DOESN'T PLACE AN ANONYMOUS CALL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK.  WITH ALL THAT ASIDE, GRISHAM'S STYLE IS EXCELLENT, VERY READABLE AND FAST PACED	1997-02-17

A VERY ENJOYABLE READ, BUT STILL NOT ON PAR WITH HIS FIRST 3 NOVELS.  NOTHING EVER REALLY GOES WRONG FOR THE HERO.  I DID ENJOY THE INSIGHTS OF JURY DUTY, ALTHOUGH, THE REALITY IS THAT MOST JURIES AND PROSPECTIVE JURORS ARE TREATED AS SUB CLASS PEOPLE.  IF YOU ARE A GRISHAM FAN READ THIS AND IF YOU HAVE NOT READ JOHN GRISHAM BEFORE READ THIS ABOUT 4TH ON THE LIST	1997-02-17

I AM ANXIOUS TO TRY ANOTHER DIRK PITT ADVENTURE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY FAN OF ACTION/ADVENTURE, BUT DO NOT READ IF YOU PLAN ON TAKING A CRUISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.	1997-02-03
