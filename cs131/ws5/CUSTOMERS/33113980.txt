Reflections by an American adoptive mother on infant adoption, birth and reunion	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A thorough, heartfelt meditation on adoption	This book is a must read for anyone interested in adoption.  First of all, it is very thorough, analyzing many aspects of adoption from a number of different angles.  The author isn't trying to push any particular point of view on the reader, but instead gives a nice overview of the relevant issues, and at times adds her opinion.  Not only is there a lot of useful information in this book, but it also is a heartwarming story about the author's adoption of her daughter and eventual reunification with the birth mother.  It is a very engaging story, and should be read by anyone wanting to learn more about adoption, or anyone who enjoys a heartwarming story.	2003-09-27

I'd say this problem is most prevalent in people with bipolar disorder.  In addition to discussing this issue, the book provides a lot of information on mental illness in general.  The quality of writing is pretty high and the book is organized quite well.  An interesting and informative read.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-04-04

I'm not sure this book is perfect, but it is definitely excellent and entertaining.  Junger is a great journalist and natural storyteller, as he brings the characters and the raging sea vividly to life.  A lot of research seems to have gone into writing this book, as it is filled with details that enrich the story.  I also found the story itself, as well as the description of the storm, quite frightening since it wasn't difficult to picture oneself in the middle of this chaos.

Fox revealed	If you like watching Michael on TV, as most people do, you'll probably also enjoy this book.  Michael writes in a humble, humorous, and candid manner as he reveals his rise to prominence, as well as some of the problems that accompanied it.  I suppose an obvious theme of the book is that luck may have played somewhat of a role in the good things that happened to Michael, that if a break or two hadn't gone his way, we may have never heard of him.  However, I like to think that he has such a great personality that he would have eventually succeeded anyway.

However, I'm only giving the book four stars because perhaps some editorial additions could have provided more background on when the notes were written and what was going on in Kurt's life at the time.  Some people, including perhaps Chris from Nirvana, think it was an ... thing to publish these journals.  I have to say I partially agree that it is a bad thing, but on the other hand it makes you feel closer to Kurt to be able to read about some of these ideas.  At times I found this book depressing, and at other times I found it extremely humorous.  I think Kurt actually had a great sense of humor, in spite of his demons.  He is an immortal rock god.

Yes, Lance is a cycling hero by any standard, having already won the Tour de France four times, but to have showed such perseverance in the face of life threatening and body wrecking cancer is just amazing.  Most people would have never considered making a comeback after something like that, but Lance not only came back- he triumphed.  This book gives the reader all the details of the battle with cancer, and much much more.  By reading it, you get to know Lance as a person, and get inside the psyche of this great champion.  The book is a real page turner, too, as I hardly put it down.  An excellent read even if you have no interest in cycling.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-04-03

Books	4	3	4	N	N	Entertaining and informative	This is a very enjoyable read.  I realize that most people will read it to learn how to become more financially independent, but it's also an entertaining memoir in its own right.  The author had a &quot;rich dad&quot; and a &quot;poor dad&quot;, the rich one being the father of his childhood buddy, and the poor one being his biological father.  The rich dad was a highly successful businessman who mentored the author about the road to gaining wealth, whereas the poor dad was an educational administrator who never gained wealth himself.  The author received conflicting advice from these two dads, and in the end he mainly chose to listen to his rich dad, and supposedly this ended up making him very wealthy.  While this book won't tell you everything you need to know about building wealth, it may be a good place to start.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Avery Z.

There's not really much of a plot, other than intense rumination and speculation, so don't expect any dramatic action.  What you will find is a glorious stream of consciousness approach to developing characters and letting their random thoughts weave together an interesting story.

It's really more of a snapshot of a fair in Chicago in the late 1890s, including a lot of somewhat clinical and scholarly information about the fair and life in Chicago at the time.  The murder and madness aspect of the story is a bit underdeveloped and actually quite boring.  The characters were not really developed that thoroughly, as I found myself wanting to know more about what made them tick.  On the other hand, the quality of writing is excellent and the book moves quickly enough to hold the reader's attention.  Overall, still a pretty good book.  Avery Z.

The conclusions he reaches are somewhat disturbing and depressing, as it seems that much of the continent is in chaos or decay or both.  On the other hand, it's an interesting travelogue of an incredible, hands on journey from the north to the south.  The author has good journalistic skills, as he shares a number of entertaining and amusing anecdotes about what he sees and who he meets along the way.

Deaver has never been sharper, as he weaves magic and mystery together into a thrilling and suspenseful plot that is both complex and outragious.  I felt the characters were well developed and very likeable, and especially the detective duo seemed smart and sexy together.  Without giving away the plot, I found the description of the magic, including the illusions and sleight of hand to be compelling and very interesting.

It put Crichton on the map, and, as far as I know, laid the foundation for a &quot;race against technology/the unknown&quot; formula that he has used many times in subsequent novels.  This book is gripping and suspenseful, moves with relentless pace, and demands to be read from start to finish without being put down.  It achieves what most thrillers hope to achieve without being overly pushy with the reader.  The characters are cool, easy to identify with, and well developed.  The science is also technically interesting, though the book was written quite a while ago.  Overall, a classic book that anyone with an interest in Crichton or science should read.  Avery Z.

It has the feel of a classic, one of those ideas where you say, &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot;  One might make the argument that the (human) characters take a back seat to the dinosaurs, but I don't believe this is the case- I found the characters to be well developed and interesting.  Crichton also seems to do the dinosaurs justice, as he seems to have done his homework on this subject, though I'm guessing some in the scientific community might say that he's taken a few liberties in speculating about some of the dinosaurs' characteristics.  But that's artistic license.  Overall, a highly entertaining and imaginative novel.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-31

My primary criticisms of this book are that the character development is a little weak and that the plot seems to fit sort of a prototypical Crichton mold without breaking new ground.  I don't think Crichton should stray away from his fascination and concern with technology in future novels, though I would like to somehow see him reinvent himself a little.  I don't know how, but I would like to see him expand his vision a little in the future.  Nonetheless, &quot;Prey&quot; is still quite a good book that most Crichton fans will enjoy.  Avery Z.

Every Crichton fan should probably read it just to get the inside scoop on the man himself, perhaps to see what has driven him to write so many fascinating books, and also to see what fuels some of his philosophy that comes through in his writing.  &quot;Travels&quot; certainly isn't all about philosophy, as much of it consists of some very entertaining anecdotes, though there's a philosophical vein that runs through it.  It's not preachy, though Crichton seems to be trying to stimulate thinking in the reader.

Why couldn't he just profile a more realistic group of career thinkers who don't have to stand out in such an eccentric or stylish way?  The profiles are still quite interesting, though I found the book to be somewhat shallow in the end.  Bronson appears to take on a deeply philosophical subject but then fails to ask the right, probing questions of his subjects, and also fails to more fully develop these characters.

After a shipwreck, the lead character, Pi, finds himself adrift on the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat filled with unusual animals.  I suppose the first obvious parallel is with Noah from the bible, though I'm not sure the author was aiming for such a simplistic interpretation.

With this effort, Hillenbrand proves that she is a master at bringing history to life, breathing life into an era gone by.  I have to admit, I'd never heard of Seabiscuit the horse until I read this book, but you certainly don't have to have lived in the 1930s to appreciate this book.  Hillenbrand spares no details, and apparently conducted excruciating research before writing this.  The characters- including the horses- are richly developed and vividly brought to life.  The reader comes away with a moving feeling of what it might have felt like to be involved in horse racing in the 1930s.  Highly recommended.  Avery Z.

It is great due to the combination of an excellent story and the utter honesty of the storyteller.  Swofford was a Marine on the front lines of the Gulf War in 1991, when he was just a very young man.  His depiction of the fighting itself, as well as the training and anticipation before the fighting, is brutally honest and graphic.  No details are spared for the faint of heart.  Battle scenes are horrific, chaotic, and somewhat surreal, like scenes out of the movie \\"Apocalypse Now\\".  The reader comes away with the impression that war is not at all glamorous or redeeming, but perhaps is sometimes a necessary evil.

I agree with the doctor's philosophy that most mental disturbances can be attributed to metabolic abnormalities in different regions of the brain, though there's nothing too earthshaking about this idea.  Many of the cognitive therapy excercises seem to be derived from ideas that Aaron Beck and David Burns have had, though the doctor does a good job summarizing and presenting these ideas in a practical, easy to use manner.

Lori's description of schizophrenia itself- the disorienting and downright frightening aspects of the disease- is one of the best accounts of the disease that I have read.  It's comforting to think that the treatment of this disease has improved substantially since the 1980s due to the advent of the atypical antipsychotics, but I have my doubts as to whether these newer medications are really all that effective.

Stoll is clearly an authority on the subject and does an excellent job of explaining what is known so far about the omega-3s and what some of the remaining questions are.  Excellent information is provided on how to supplement your diet with more fish oil through food intake or supplements.  Some ideas in the book are a bit speculative, however, and perhaps the entire case of there being some sort of epidemic omega-3 shortage that is causing a good deal of depression is overstated and premature.  Nonetheless, there does seem to be some correlation between low rates of depression and cultures with high dietary intake of omega-3s.  I wonder if ancient man ate much fish oil, as this is an evolutionary question that might tell us something about whether we're really missing out on this supposedly essential substance today.

The quality of writing is quite high, though some sections could possibly have been shortened.  The organization of the book is pretty straightforward and intuitive, and I found this to be a smooth and easy read.  My biggest criticism is that I would have liked to see the author open up a little more with more insider tips and idiosyncratic findings, rather than tending a little more toward reserved generalities.

Most of the advice is so simple that I had to wonder whether she's trying to get a reaction out of people by saying silly things, or perhaps she really is serious.  Like another reviewer said, reading this is sort of like overhearing a conversation between thirteen-year-old girls- not exactly too sophisticated.  I don't know whether Wurtzel is getting desperate for more attention, but maybe she isn't, because this probably won't do it.  I'd really like to see her do something a little more intellectually challenging, like her previous books.  Overall though, most of her fans may still enjoy this book.  Avery Z.

This is a very entertaining and provocative book that proves that Wurtzel does indeed have a brain.  A lot of research clearly went into compiling it, and I think she's done a pretty good job of picking women throughout history who have indeed been &quot;difficult&quot; for one reason or another.  Her interpretations of the information, rather than the information itself, is sometimes kind of questionable, but I suppose that's artistic license in a book like this.  Like another reviewer stated, this book does ramble on a bit, but then again I suppose that Wurtzel's style and she's entitled to it.  Overall, a very enjoyable and somewhat thought provoking read that will especially be enjoyed by Wurtzel fans.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-26

He seems to lose me a little with his super long books, like this and &quot;The Stand&quot;.  I would have preferred 300 or 400 pages instead, as this would have improved the pace considerably.  Surprisingly, though, I found this to be a pretty quick read in spite of the 1000+ page length.  I'd say the strongest point of the book is character development, as King manages to bring these folks vividly to life, and I felt like I was friends with them by the end of the book.  Another strong point of the book is the creepiness of the monster- the &quot;it&quot;- if you will.  I felt this was one of King's scarier creations.  Overall, definitely worth a read, especially if you're a King fan.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-25

Paul is a writer who crashes his car in the middle of a snowstorm in the middle of nowhere, and has the misfortune of being &quot;rescued&quot; by a psychotically devoted fan (Annie) who imprisons him in her house.  It's pretty amusing to see what King has to say about Paul, and I got the impression that King was poking a little fun at writers, but the reader will have to judge for herself.  The plot is simple- sort of an extended siege in Annie's house- which turns out to be pretty exciting in the end.  Annie has something coming, and the reader will have to see if she gets it!  Overall, a very entertaining read, and I'm glad King didn't drag it out to 700+ pages like some of his other books.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-25

I was wondering if this was King's first novel about aliens, though I guess I'm not enough of a King scholar to know for sure.  I'd say it's a little too long for my taste- 700+ pages- as I tend to go to sleep a little with King's longer books, such as this, &quot;The Stand&quot;, and &quot;It&quot;.  As usual with King's books, character development is one of the stronger points of this book; I found these characters eccentric and interesting- perhaps not your standard hero types.  I also found the description of the aliens interesting and not really all that scary, though I'm not sure King was trying to scare us too much with this one.  Overall, an entertaining read.  Avery Z.

The plot is cool and spooky, the characters are pretty good, and there are some great late night walks through the woods with evil not far behind.  I dig the whole supernatural revival from death idea- I suppose nearly everyone would like to live indefinitely but at what cost?  King explores this thorny issue and I suppose concludes that there may be an unholy price to pay for immortality.  At least in Pet Semetary.  The movie wasn't too bad either; at least it was better than most movies of King's books.  Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\".	2003-03-24

A very entertaining story.  \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is memorable and uplifting, minus any obvious horror, and thus showing a seldom seen facet of King.  The fourth story wasn't as interesting to me.  Overall though, a very good book.  Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\".	2003-03-24

I'm trying to decide whether I think this collection is better than &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, and I think it is.  King is a master of the unexpected.  He's also a master of dreaming up stories for which, after you read them, you might say, &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot;  In other words, he's able to come up with ideas that are so basic to who we are as people that you can't help but identify with them.

It is still a really good book, and I dig the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland thing he's got going on.  The book even has the makings of a classic, since it's sort of an epic showdown between good and evil, but overall I think it's a little drawn out and boring.  The characters are quite well developed and likeable, however, and this is one of the stronger points of the book.  I still recommend this book, though I don't think it's King at his best.  Avery Z.

Nonetheless, the book is well worth reading as well, since the entire story is absolutely chilling.  The Overlook Hotel is a great setting for maximum creepiness; it's a great place for people to go insane.  I'm not sure the supernatural phenomena were necessary to increase the horror, though I'm guessing King would say they are central to the story.  Overall, one of King's better books.  Avery Z.

It's partly a memoir and partly a workshop on how to write- both parts are enjoyable and very interesting.  It was a lot of fun to hear the stories about King as a child, teenager, and young man struggling to scrape together a living and anxious to get his work published.  Apparently the man is human after all, since we get to see him as vulnerable, with an uncertain future, before he was able to establish himself.  My guess is that he eventually would have succeeded even without &quot;Carrie&quot;, since I think he's a special talent who would have persevered in his writing and would eventually have been recognized.  His advice on writing is particularly interesting, even if you're not an aspiring writer- it gives the reader a new lens through which to view his stories.  Overall, an excellent read.  Avery Z.

Cujo is one cool cat of a bad guy, and I think choosing a St. Bernard as the breed was an interesting and paradoxical choice by King, mainly because St. Bernard's are usually such nice dogs.  I only give this book four stars because I think it's a little lean both on plot and character development; I just think the story was a bit slow at times and none of the characters were too memorable for me.

The characters are well developed and memorable, the high school setting is cool, and the plot is imaginative and moves with good pace.  I especially dig the high school setting, since it makes for such a great place for different personalities to collide in a way with which every former high school student can relate.  Arnie, the main character, is the classic loser-nerd-loner guy who falls in love with one bad car, Christine, that figures to change his life with a vengeance.  His buddy, his girlfriend, the high school dirtbag enemies, and the old guy who owns the garage are all cool cats that King does a great job of bringing to life.  And only the wild genius of King can inject human qualities, like jealousy and anger, into Christine in such a cool way.  This is King at his best.  Avery Z.

Kay summarizes many of the relevant studies on the subject of bipolar disorder and creativity, and some of these studies are her own.  I agree that bipolar disorder probably has a higher rate of prevalance in the artistic community, though I don't think this is the whole story- many artists simply don't exhibit the disorder, so what about them?  What I really believe is that artists have a super high level of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which may be the chemical that is cycling up and down in bipolar disorder.  Either way, this is a very interesting book that will appeal to a broad audience.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-21

It's hard not to love the guy at least a little, and it's surprising that he didn't turn out to be some type of sociopath or start a cult for rabbits or something.

However, I think it's a little delusional or uninformed to think that medication doesn't play an essential role in the recovery of a great deal of people suffering from depression or bipolar disorder.

Some reviewers have described the writing style as dry, and I agree with this- it's pretty much just a dry presentation of facts, though I found the style conducive to learning.  I also found it interesting to hear about the illness from an experienced psychiatrist's perspective, as his opinions are grounded in a lot of clinical experience.  I also agree with one other reviewer that he sometimes doesn't seem too kind in his description of patients.  Nonetheless, definitely worth reading to expand your knowledge of this illness.  Avery Z.

Admittedly, the author provides a fairly convincing argument to support her diet deficiency theory.  It's not even that difficult to apply the dietary suggestions to yourself.

As far as I know, this book is the most comprehensive compilation of information about manic depression.  In fact, I don't think there's another book at all like it.

Nasar did a great deal of research in compiling this book. Nash is described as a lot more strange and somewhat more boring than he is in the movie, and Nasar's description is probably more accurate. I think Hollywood did a disservice to schizophrenics by depicting the disease as a lot more romantic than it really is.

Wurtzel is like the Energizer Bunny- she keeps going, and going, and going when it comes to doing some far out, depression fueled dysfunctional behavior...and then writing about it. I think she's super cool, and I wish that, just for once, a magical medication would appear, in shining armor, to sweep her off her feet, and make her feel normal.

Pinker has done an admirable job approaching such a massively complex problem. However, I think he's a little thick on the psychology, and thin on the neuroscience. For example, I'm not sure he mentions the word &quot;neurotransmitter&quot;. Nonetheless, anyone remotely interested in how the mind works ought to read this book.  Avery Z.

It was disturbing to find that Martha had to resort to ECT to treat herself, but at least it worked. Overall, the book is very well-written and keeps the reader's attention throughout. It's a reminder of how a positive attitude can help one ride out the storm during the treatment of severe depression. Even though I'm giving it five stars, I don't think it's quite as good as my favorite mental illness memoirs: &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot; and &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;.

I'd say her writing is nearly as outstanding as that in Kay Jamison's \\"An Unquiet Mind\\" and Susanna Kaysen's \\"Girl, Interrupted\\".

He earned the title by writing &quot;Listening to Prozac&quot;, which stands out as truly unique in the psychiatric literature. It is a combination of interesting case studies, biological data, and philosophical reflection. Kramer has great insight into the psyche and writes extremely well.

However, I wouldn't say the book is great or even that convincing in its arguments about science approaching a dead end, but nonetheless it raises important questions and gets a dialogue started.

I come from the school of thought that the greatest component of moderate to severe depression is biochemical, though most people find themselves in the realm of mild depression.

That said, this book is a little bit loony- Breggin has taken such an extreme stance against biochemical treatment of mental illness that he almost can't be taken seriously. He's so far from objective, that eventually the discerning reader may just stop listening. I suppose people should read this book anyway, as it may change their perspective a bit.

It rivals \\"The Bipolar Child\\" in that it is an attempt to provide a comprehensive picture of the disorder to parents and doctors.  I don't think it's quite as well written or well organized as \\"The Bipolar Child\\", but I still recommend that it be read since I think a number of sources of information should be used when approaching a complex subject like bipolar disorder.

The quality of writing is pretty good and the story inspires empathy in the reader.  Like another reviewer said, it did have a little too much God in it for my taste. Nonetheless, it makes a significant contribution to the genre of mental illness memoirs and is worth reading if you suffer from bipolar disorder or know someone who does.  Avery Z.

It's an interactive book in which the patient is asked to actively participate in his own treatment program. I think it's indispensible for anyone suffering from bipolar disorder, and probably should also be read by family and friends of the afflicted.  Avery Z.

In other words, the author has the most severe form of the illness. While the writing isn't as good as in the finest mental illness memoirs, like &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot;, the author is still able to vividly communicate the horrors of this illness. I do wish he would have been a little more constructive in his criticisms of psychiatry, as perhaps some readers will get the impression that this is not a very treatable illness, when in fact it is. I do, however, agree that it does often take many years before a bipolar individual is properly diagnosed. Overall, a good book that should be read by anyone interested in bipolar disorder.  Avery Z.

Others have labeled Behrman a self-promoter. These allegations may be partly correct, but one aspect of writing a good memoir is to entertain the reader a little.  For example, I found the description of Behrman's art forgery interesting and consistent with manic behavior. I suppose the book is a little light on information about bipolar disorder, but perhaps describing bipolar disorder in detail wasn't really the intent- hardly anyone criticizes Kay Jamison for not providing more info about bipolar disorder in &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot;. In summary, Behrman has assembled a pretty good book in &quot;Electroboy&quot; that anyone interested in bipolar disorder, or who likes entertaining narrative nonfiction, should read.  Avery Z.

Solomon clearly went to herculean lengths in compiling this book, and I believe it deserves the accolades it has received. My favorite line is, &quot;Mood is like the climate, and emotions are like the weather.&quot; I really learned a lot reading this and would recommend it to anyone interested in depression.  Avery Z.

Nearly everyone will learn a lot about the disease by reading this book. It should be read by everyone with the illness, as well as their family and friends.  Along with &quot;The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide&quot;, this is required reading for anyone who wants to gain a practical understanding of the illness.  Avery Z.

Styron is clearly a great writer- few would dispute that. Nonetheless, I found his description of the subjective feeling and experience of depression to be somewhat lacking. Of course, it's very difficult to describe any subjective mental state, but nonetheless I didn't find his attempt too compelling. On the other hand, the book is very well-written and stylistically pleasing.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-10

Is she a voice for her generation? Yes, or at least more so than Elizabeth Wurtzel. I have but one point of contention with Lizzie- this search for &quot;successful&quot; people with bipolar disorder seems a little off the mark. I realize finding people who are bipolar and successful can serve as a source of hope for those who are not (yet) successful, but perhaps it would have been more compelling to seek out bipolar individuals of all types, regardless of their degree of success. Overall though, this is a very good book, Lizzie is an excellent writer, and I believe she has broken new ground in the genre of mental illness narratives.  Avery Z.

The quality of writing isn't as good as that of the finest mental illness memoirs, like &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot; and &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, but it's definitely well worth reading. One intriguing point is that there might be some relationship between mania and Patty's acting skill. In other words, bipolar disorder may confer some advantages to the afflicted, in spite of some of its dreadful consequences.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-09

It is probably one of the most vivid and articulate descriptions of mental illness ever written.  Not surprisingly, I also found it disturbing and somewhat frightening.  Plath is such a skilled and fluid writer that the book almost demands that you read it many times.  Highly recommended.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-09

It's unusual because the style of writing and method of storytelling are both a bit eccentric- this is fine with me but some readers may have a problem with it.  I'm a sucker for memoirs and find that they provide insight into mental illness that no textbook will ever capture.  Furthermore, I find that every mental illness memoir author has a unique contribution to make.  With these two points in mind, I'd recommend this memoir to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder.

It loses one star for the misleading title. A more appropriate one would be &quot;Wurtzel Nation&quot; or, like one other reviewer suggested, &quot;Listening to Wurtzel&quot;, since it's mainly just one long soliloquy. It loses another star for being fairly boring. In spite of these shortcomings, I still think it's worth reading, especially if you're suffering from depression. The young woman has a strong voice, whether or not it's the voice of a generation, and it should be heard.  Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;.	2003-03-09

In comparison, nearly all the other mental illness memoirs lack flair- only Susanna Kaysen (&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;) can write as well. So not only is Kay an authority on bipolar disorder, but also she is a great writer and brave person. It's hard to find any fault with &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot;- I suppose it could be criticized for not providing more information about bipolar disorder, but that was probably never the intent. The interested reader should check out her other books, including the textbook on manic-depressive illness, for more info about the disease. &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot; is poetic and, along with &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;, approaches fine literature.

She appears to have been afflicted with a pretty severe variety of the disorder, perhaps Bipolar I would be the proper diagnosis. The writing isn't as good as in the finest mental illness memoirs, such as \\"An Unquiet Mind\\" or \\"Girl, Interrupted\\", but she is still able to tell her story vividly and honestly.

Since the circumstances of the story are so interesting, as a writer all Susanna needs to do is &quot;get out of the way&quot; and I think she does this well. She has a terse writing style which I find appealing. Her character descriptions are first rate, and I think she has a subtle but keen sense of humor.

I agree that Hitler and Napoleon seemed to exhibit symptoms of mania, though I'm not sure about Stalin. I'd say in general, many leaders throughout history may have been manic or hypomanic. George Custer and Alexander the Great, for example. An entertaining and somewhat controversial read.  Avery Z. Conner author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"	2003-03-04
