I was not getting anywhere, and purchased this book to see if it could help me with my technique. <br /> <br />I read this book, and literally within two sessions at the pool I was being complimented on my swimming.  The stroke began to feel effortless.  I started to \\"glide\\" through the water as opposed to flailing through the pool.  It was miraculous. <br /> <br />And I honestly did not even do any of the suggested drills.  I simply tried to mentally apply the principles.   <br /> <br />I must admit, that for all I know this could be swimming 101 and could be what every high school or college swimmer learns.  However, for someone like me, who just swam with no formal instruction, this book is revolutionary. <br /> <br />If you have been swimming and want to start learning to glide, this book is for you.  (Just the other day I crossed the pool using only 15 strokes, after each stroke it was like I was just floating through the pool with ease!)	2005-06-01

I run and bike, but have never done a triathlon before.  I just did not have any clue how to design a program that would allow me to incorporate running, swimming, and cycling in such a way that I would be able to finish a sprint distance triathlon.    Using the program in this book I was able to train for and easily complete my first sprint triathlon.    If you have any interest in training for a triathlon and do not know how, I would HIGHLY recommend this book.  It is not technical.  It makes you believe you can do it, and it provides a program framework that works.    The program(s) in this book cover fitness levels from bare beginners all the way to single sport Gods (runners, cyclists, etc.)  They are geared towards a sprint distance, but adaptable up to 1/2 ironman distance.    Each program is doable (time wise).  You do not need to quit your job and divorce your wife.      Overall, fantastic.  If you want to train but do not know where to start, this is where to start.	2005-05-30

I did not enjoy this book one bit.  I read fantasy because I enjoy heroes.  I enjoy reading about other worlds.  I want likeable characters and a plot that moves along.  I want to be happy. <br /> <br />I just could not get myself into the character of Thomas.  He is angry and bitter.  He RAPES a young girl.  Why am I going to cheer for this character?  Why am I going to care what happens to him?  I spent the majority of the book hoping he would get killed. <br /> <br />I gave the book two stars because I in some ways appreciate the fact that this is an original work.  The main character is highly flawed and has leprosy.  The world building is done well.  The writing style is very good. <br /> <br />If you like dark fantasy, or do not mind a flawed hero, then by all means try this book.  I personally did not like it at all.	2005-05-28

If you want to run a four hour marathon and spend four months training for it, then buy this book.  It is slim, it is focused, easy to follow, enjoyable to read.  It gives you what the title says it gives you. <br /> <br />If you want to gain a deeper understanding of marathoning, or want to run one in three hours, etc.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  It is not written with that puropose. <br /> <br />I wanted to run my first marathon in four hours.  I bought this book.  I am as happy with it as anyone could possibly be.  I cannot imagine any complaints. <br /> <br />(In a different review a reader talks about the quality of the advice (shoes selection, clothing, etc.)  Hogwash.  For first time marathoners (runners even) the advice is sound and exactly what you need to know.	2005-05-28

(The books are only loosely connected.  You can read one with out reading the others, or read them in any order you wish.) <br /> <br />The novel is fast paced.  The action is crisp and exciting.  Yet it is not a shallow novel at all.  There are some deep themes that run throughout. <br /> <br />The characters are great.  These are the best Gemmel has done, and he does great characters.  They are all flawed, but their flaws do not keep them from being heroic and likeable. <br /> <br />Gemmel introduces some new cultures here to and it works very well.  For the first time he has some \\"chinese style\\" characters (my favorite in the book) and a \\"jungle/rainforest\\" type character. <br /> <br />The plot works great.  A group of heroes start off on what at first seems like an insignificant quest to rescue a peasant no one cares about.  Each has his own motivations for taking this on.  Soon we see that the quest was much larger (and important) than it at first appeared to be. <br /> <br />All told this novel is brilliant.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you read Gemmels first two, then you owe it to yourself to read this one.  If you have not read Gemmel, do not worry, this is a GREAT novel.	2005-05-28

Instead, the backdrop offers us a middle eastern flair, and in my mind this made all the difference in the world because other than that, the book really is your standard fantasy fair.  The characters are two dimensional, the plot is a little above average, but still never really takes off, and the demons are unconvincing.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for a great read, great literature, or anything that will move you, move on.  If you are looking for something that is a little different to pass the time in between your series favorites, then this may be worth a shot.  (One bonus is that even though it is part of a series, this book works perfectly fine as a stand alone. Therefore, if you do not like it enough to move on, then you have not lost anything.)	2005-02-27

The five star people are right. <br /> <br />If you have read game of thrones and hated it (which I cannot imagine), then do not bother continuing with Clash of Kings because it is just like the first. <br /> <br />If you read Game of Thrones, loved it, and have not read Clash of Kings yet, then know this.

This is really the guy who wrote Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, and The Lions of Al Rassan?  I must be missing something.  I know that millions of people should  not be able to be this wrong, but in this case they most certainly are.    This is probably one of the worst fantasy novels I have ever read.  Nothing that happens seems to be natural, but happens because the author wants it to happen.  No characters seem to be alive, but only exist because the author needs them to exist.  The conversations are stilted and dull.  Nothing works in this novel.    In the reviews, there seems to be a consensus that things get better later in the series, but I say so what?  This book stinks and the fact is there are better starts to better series.  The sad thing is that I was / am a big Kay fan.    If you like the standard, derivative, sub par, fantasy, then eat your heart out.  If you are like me and read Tigana, read the Lions of Al Rassan, A Song for Arbonne, read the Sarantine Mosaic, heard that Kay's first work was a trilogy and got real excited to see what he could do with traditional fantasy, then do not bother.

I personally think it is the best fantasy that has ever been written, and cannot conceive of anything that could possible be better.  Characters that just feel real.  Moments that literally take your heart and squeeze it, but it never feels like you are being manipulated.  Action that is intense but not fake.  My only advice is this, do not start this series if you are not ready for it.  <br /> <br />Take everything that was good about Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings, multiply it by 5 and you have this book.  It is a rollercoaster an this is the ride of your life.  I read it in one longe session and then immediately started it again.	2005-02-27

Ths is not Tolkien style fantasy, with elves, gnomes, and other mystical creatures.  If that is the type of fantasy you enjoy, then  be forwarned.  This a book about heroes, battles, courage, blood, and more battles.  In other words, it is alpha male, meat and potatoes, blue collar fantasy, and I for one loved every minute of it.  I would not say that this is high literature on par with George RR Martin.  The characters are a little too shallow and the romance too unbelievable for this book to be elevated to those pinnacles.  However, it is certainly above average and the author manages to tell a great tale, does it with style, and makes the book enjoyable.  Well worth the price, you wont feel sorry you spent the money or the time reading it.	2005-02-26

If you are a fan of Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, or the likes, then you really owe it to yourself to read this two volume series.  Wolfe does in these two books what authors like the aforementioned cannot do in twenty.<br /><br />First things first, the book is accessible.  The chararacters are likeable.  The main character is a person you want to \\"win.\\"  The plot manages to be conventional and at the same time wholly original.  Wolfe proves that sometimes telling an old story well is better than telling a brand new story in a mediocre fashion.<br /><br />If you have not read the knight, then you really need to read it before moving on to this volume.  Take my advice and do not be afraid to order both the knight and the wizard at the same time.  Once you put down the knight, (most likely after a few mammoth reading sessions) you will want to immediately pick up the wizard.<br /><br />Great, Great, Great.	2005-02-21

I thought the socio/political dimension (wings vrs landbound) was very unique.  The central conflict, the fact that we can never really tell what the consequences of our actions may be, way handled very well.  I particularly liked the fact that each section took place many years later.  This really allowed for a sense of believable change, nothing happens overnight.  The character were average.  I did not particularly find any one of them to be memorable, but this is a novel that is carried by its plot and setting anyways, so it does not really stand on its characters. <br /> <br />Overall this is a good novel.  Worth your time and money.  (Just do not expect this to be the Fire and Ice series, it is NOT.)	2005-02-21

I like fantasy.  So I picked up this book and read it.  Since then my life has never been the same.  How can I read the average slop that is fantasy when I have now tasted what true brilliance is?  How can I suffer through anymore \\"wizard and young person who is more than he/she seems\\" when I have experienced a plot that defies description?  Reading fantasy novels, which was once my passion, has now just become what I do in between the release dates of the Fire and Ice series.  If you are happy with the standard twenty volume series, then stay away.  Ignorance is bliss.  This novel truly redefines the entire genre in a way NO writer has.<br /><br />First, as I stated before, each character is well defined.  Even the ones you think are not, will be later.  Second, the plot is BRILLIANT.  It is literally impossible to say what this book is about because it is about so many things.  However, despite its complexitey, it really is very accessible.  Within two chapters you are hooked.  Third, the writing is superb.  There is nothing about this book that is negative.<br /><br />The only caveat I would have is that with an opening this good, things cannot possible get better.  Luckily, I have read the next two volumes, and let me say, things can get better.<br /><br />If you have not read this book, then please do so right now.  The accolades are deserved.  The love is earned.  This is a bestseller that should be because it is writing at its best.	2005-02-21

Do you enjoy stories that have to do with scotland, norway, ireland?  Do you appreciate solid writing?  If so, then this book may be of interest.  After all, the crusades are the backdrop, the main character is from scotland, and the writing is solid. <br /> <br />That being said, there is nothing particularly special about this book.  As I said, the writing is solid, not spectacular.  The characters are passable, but in a week you will not remember anything about them.  In my opinion, the spirituality / theology aspects are weak and distract instead of enliven. <br /> <br />However, if you are looking for something to read, then why not?

I am a fantasy fan, but one of my complaints about the genre is that what you find usually borders on two extremes.  Either a novel is utterly derivative and full of cliche, shoddy writing, and the exact same plot filled with different names, or it is so high minded and literary that it is barely understandable.  You either get \\"cheap thrills\\" (Robert Jordan) or art house fantasy (China Mieville).  You rarely get the novel that is well written and truly enjoyable.  But when you do get it (a la George RR Martin,) You get something special.    The Knight is that something special.  With The Knight Gene Wolfe has finally taken all his talent, skill, and potential, and he has given us an accesible novel that is brilliantly done.  The whole key to this hinges on the protagonist.  Able is a young teenage boy who finds himself with the body of a true warrior.  Able is a likeable hero with all the flaws of a teenage boy, yet at the same time he is basically a good kid. The story of Able's quest to be a Knight is well written, endearing, and filled with timeless value.  It trancends being a story about Able and becomes a story about honor.    You have a strong main character.  There are strong side characters.  The pacing of the plot is brisk and moves at a nice clip.  There are moments of humor and moments of horror.  But throught it all Able's determintation to be a noble knight stands as the center of a great story.    There are some quibbles.  You end the book still not really knowing why any of this has happened.  There are far too many questions left unanswered.  But this is classic Wolfe and this is what second volumes are for.    All in all a tremendous novel.  If you are a fan of fantasy you need to read this book.  Wolfe proves that talent makes the tale and sometimes the old stories are the ones worth reading (and writing.)  Outstanding.	2004-12-31

Imagine four books that are 800 pages each.  That is 3200 pages.  This is longer than the Bible.  This is longer than the Koran.  For the love of God, what story do you need to tell that cannot be told in under 3200 pages?      First things first, the positives.  I very much appreciated the book's African center.  Very clever, very interesting.  Had the main story been placed in the United Stated, I probably would have lost interest much sooner.  Do not get me wrong, I still lost interest, but not as soon as may have happened.  The main characters are strong.  I enjoyed the Rene and Xabbu characters.  They are very well written.  I enjoyed the cyber barbarian.  Very good.  Another positive is the techno aspects.  Great imagineering of where the internet could be.  I loved the concept of a virtual reality being molded by our class distinctions.  Quite cool.  I liked the plot.  Mysterious.  What is happening to the children?  What is this strange club?  Many more little questions that I foung intriguing and wondered what would happen.    Characters are well done.  Plot is well done.  \\"World building\\" (setting) is well done.  What is the problem?  Simple.  After 800 PAGES I would expect that the central story of this novel had been solved and that the elements for the following volumes would be in place.  Wrong.  After 800 pages, not much has really happened.  Not much of the plot has been moved forward.  It is like a bad soap opera where things keep happening but nothing is really moving.  This is not the first volume of a series.  This is the first fourth of a 3200 page novel.  There is a major difference and I just do not want to read through another 2400 pages to see how this ends up.    Edit this down to two volumes and you could have had a winner.  As it is, I started it, I just do not want to finish it.	2004-12-31

This book is boring.  There are two main reasons I decided to spend my time reading this book.  The first is that it is a stand alone novel (God I hope this is just a stand alone novel.)  With so many of our authors deciding to spend 10 volumes telling a story, I think it is high time we reward those who decide to write a novel and then move on to better things.  In this regard the novel did not disappoint.  For all intents and purposes it is a stand alone novel.    The second reason I decided to read this was because of its \\"unique twist on the Faerie world.\\"  Sorry.  How is this for unique? An alternate world with Faeries instead of mortals.  The Faerie world uses \\"magic\\" instead of science.  The Faerie world has social and political problems.  Have you just about fallen out of your chair at the stunning originality.  Want to get even more unconventional?  The hero is \\"more than he seems.\\"  During the quest to find himself he saves the world, and while saving the world he finds himself.  Oh, and he finds true love.      Maybe I am being a bit too harsh.  Fantasy does not have to be original.  Give us a likeable hero, some snappy sidekicks, good pacing, and all is well.  The problem is that the hero is not likeable.  He is a thirty year old who has the mentality of a ten  year old.  I have seen crack addicts with a better grip on reality than this joker.  The pacing is atrocious.  We spend 95% of the novel wondering what is so special about this guy, and then find out that what makes him special is not all that special.  The story takes too long to start, and then does not give enough time for the climax.  I could go on.  The villians are lame.  The love story is unbelievable.  And in the end it really is just boring.      What is most unforgiveable is that buried in this sludge is a GREAT novel waiting to be written.  The story of Mud Button and the Goblins (a side story really) is interesting and would have made a fantastic book.      Overall, this is not the worst novel I have ever read.  But then  again I do read a lot.	2004-12-31

It is both well researched and well written.  What makes this book so good is the fact that if you follow the program the author is outlining, then you will cover every aspect of fitness that is important, the author does not leave anything out.  From weigthlifting, to cardio, to stretching, to anaerobic interval style training, everything is present in this program.  I have read many other books that make an argument that weightlifting is essential, but leave out how to integrate cardio work.  Some books emphasize cardio, but leave out the short &quot;sprint&quot; style interval training that is so important to overall fitness.  This plan covers everything!<br />Another aspect about this book that I found favorable is that it is realistic about the time needed to get physically fit.  You cannot make great gains in fitness and health in 30 minutes three times a week.  However, the plans in this book are very reasonable, ranging from a little over three hours a week for those with less time to plans for athletes that take six hours or more a week.<br />There are some drawbacks to this book however.  The first is that while it discusses lifting weights, it does not give enough detail on weightlifting technique.  I would recommend that a person investigate sources for correctly learning how to lift weights.  The author also recommends some exercises that most people would be better off never trying (hack squats for example.)  The author also recommends some olympic style lifts, but these are highly advanced lifts and should only be done by people who have been trained by a qualified coach.<br />I also would have liked nutrition to be covered a bit more.  The author talks about supplementation and protien, but a few sample meal plans would have been nice.<br />Overall this is a well thought out and well designed program.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a book that will help them incorporate all aspects of fitness into their lives.	2004-07-19

This book discusses interval training and is a good starting point for anyone who is new to the concept.  However it is basic, and unless you have no idea what is meant by &quot;interval training&quot; then you will not learn anything new.  At its heart the message is, go really fast for a minute, then slow down for two minutes, repeat until done.<br />The most glaring problem is that the book only talks about interval training as manifested in the traditional cardio sports (running, swimming, cycling, etc.)  It does not talk about ways to incorporate interval concepts into your strength training routines, and even worse does not adequately talk about how to incorporate your strength training with the interval program recommended.<br />I think this book is most useful for the type of people who &quot;just run&quot; (or just &quot;whatever&quot;) at a steady pace for a predertmined time and have no plans to lift weights.  However, if you are looking for a more holistic program that will cover more aspects of fitness, then I would suggest searching further.	2004-07-19

One takes place when the characters are children and the other when they are adults.  By far the sections dealing with the characters as children are the best, simply perfect.  The second half, when they are adults, is not nearly as good, but that is only because the first half was so great.<br />I once used to think that this was Steven King at his best.

As you should know the book is about a man who is forced to replay his life from the age of 18 to 40 something over and over again.  The book is not so much about the concept as it is about the way we view our life and the choices we make.  The sci/fi is just the backdrop through which we get to see what the characters do and the impact their decisions have on life.    The book is not perfect.  There are some snippets of conversation that do not seem believable.  This slightly detracts from the believability of the characters.  In some areas the pace slows down.  However, these are very minor quibbles in what otherwise is a great book.	2004-07-13

This makes the book rather difficult to review.  On the one hand, I found the history aspect fascinating.  I did not really know much about the siege at Rhodes and was continually amazed at the different things I learned, from medieval warfare and tactics to culture and customs.  This aspect of the book is very well done and highly enjoyable.  However, this is not a history book, but historical fiction, and it is in the fiction aspect that the author truly fumbles.  Characters are shallow and underdeveloped.  Conversations are unnatural.  The relationships between characters are contrived.  Everything that makes this a work of fiction is very poorly handled.<br />Read this for the history aspect.  You will learn much and the author is very good in that regard.  Force yourself through the fiction and just keep telling yourself that the man is doing his best.  Next time I hope he just writes a nonfiction historical account.	2004-07-06

This book would be great for anyone who is serious about running and desires to find ways to increase performance.  The sections that break down the actual mechanics of running are complicated, but I found them to be interesting.  The sections on stretching and weightlifting exercises specifically for running are outstanding.  The chapter on the effects shoes have on feet and the case for spending more time barefoot is also a highlight.<br />If you are a casual runner who is happy and not interested in making running a top priority in your life, then I would personally skip this book.  If you are &quot;into&quot; running and seeking a deeper understanding of what the mechanics of the run are and how to improve your run, then I cannot see how this book would not help you.	2004-06-27

The authors give many real life examples of leaders who changed the culture of their school and detail how they went about making this change.  There are many practical ideas that any leader could begin incorporating right away.<br />In addition, the book is well written.  This is not &quot;heavy&quot; reading, but nonetheless I have found myself returning to it time and time again for ideas and inspiration.<br />If you are wondering how one person could possibly make a difference in a school, this book will help show you the way.	2004-06-27

It is derivative, unimaginative, and full of stock heroes, stock villans, a stock quest, and every other fantasy convention you could think of.  There is nothing original in the least.<br />However, I enjoy reading fantasy novels and do not have a problem with the fact that the story is neither original nor great.  To be quite honest, the whole time I was reading this novel, I knew it was not &quot;great&quot; fantasy and I did not care the least.  <br />If you are a fan of the genre, and looking for something to pass the time while waiting for the next Song of Fire and Ice novel, then this will serve.  Decent, not great, but certainly not terrible.	2004-06-22

I needed a book that would give me a wide array of topics, ideas, quotes, and anecdotes for a variety of occasions and situations.  This book does NOT do that.  The quotes are not intersting, the factual information is dry, and the rest of the resources are not very useful.  Considering the cost of the book, I am quite upset.  Trust me when I say that this is not money well spent.  If you need a resource to help you write interesting speeches, my advice would be to try one of the less pricier books.	2004-06-16

Overall i think it is an excellent book and wish that there were more books like this on the market.  there really is a difference between reading a historians take on waterloo, and reading letters, reports, and documents written by people who were actually there.  one thing i really like about this book is that you don't just get primary sources on &quot;the big things in history.&quot;  you get little things to, things like an account of a circumcision,an account of the finding of green children, etc.  i think these things are definately treasures and make the book so much more enjoyable.  the one problem i had with this book is that i would liked to have seen a little more explanation before each entry that helped put things in context for me.  just take a few sentences and tell me what the naploleanic wars were.  just enough to give me some idea of what i am reading about.  tell me who shelley is!!!!  now i know that i should know these things and that it is not the authors fault i dont, but it still would have been nice.  overall i would say this is a fantastic book and i eagerly await the next volume that i hope the author is working on.	2001-07-17

The book is divided into geographical sections (i.e. africa, europe,) and each section has a few poets and each poet has one or two poems presented.  Now how you feel about this book will probably depend on how you feel about poetry, and your knowledge of poetry.  I like poetry, am a casual reader of it, but really don't know anything about it.  So if you are an English major with an emphasis on world poetry, you may think differently than i did!  Overall i liked the book.  i think that many of the poems were outstanding,  i really enjoyed having one book that had such a wide variety of poets.  i liked the fact that each area was introduced by an essay that helped set things in context, and most poets were introduced with the same type of essay.  for a guy like me who doesn't know much about poetry, this was helpful.   to sum up:  if you are an english major i don't know how you will feel about this book, but if you are a casual reader of poetry who would like one book that contains poetry from around the world then i think you will like this.	2001-07-17

There are those written for the casual person, and those written for people who are really into the topic.  This book is NOT for people who are casually interested in knights, and the crusades, etc.  I found the book to be dry, dull and boring.  in my mind it is a list of names, dates, and events scrubbed clean of anything that could be \\"fun\\" to read.  If you are like me, and casually interested in the crusades and the holy orders, then skip this book, it is not written for us.  But if you are a person who is really into the topic, then i really think you would like this book because it is well researched, comprehensive, and really covers everything a person into the topic would want to know.  So whether or not you will enjoy this book depends on how you feel about the crusades.	2001-07-17

So when I saw The Scorpion and realized that it was a fantasy novel written using an Asian backdrop I was pretty excited.  I did not realize that this was a book based on a card game.  I have never played the card game, but I don't feel that you need to have played it to read this book.  Now for the review.  This is not a great book, so if you are expecting a masterpiece of fantasy you may be disappointed.  Throughout reading it I had the feeling that it was written for a younger age group, perhaps the 12-15 year old crowd.  The characterization is very crude. I found that the characters just did not have much depth.  But despite that, I did find myself enjoying the book.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace.  At no point did the book seem to drag.  And the ending was pretty good.  I think that if you enjoy the Asian culture, and are looking for a quick read that is not your typical fantasy, then you should try this book out.  I am planning on continuing the series and finding out what happens.	2001-01-06

If you are in the beginner or intermediate stages of weightlifting, then I would not recommend this book.   Go buy Beyond Brawn.  If you are really thinking of buying this book though, consider the following points.  Point one is that you really need a power rack.  If you dont have one then this workout is dangerous.  Poiint two is that you really should have a strong partner.  This is not a necessity, but it will make things a lot easier.  Point three is that the authors recommend doing your reps quickly, and say that the ability to do reps at a fster rate means you've gotten stronger.  I dont know about all that but I do know that the faster you do your reps the more likely you are to get hurt, so be careful.  Overall I would say that this is not for beginners, if you are already strong and are lokking for something different then you may want to try this book.  It is interesting, but keep the above points in mind.	2001-01-02
US	50778696	R73F3SHAQNCDL	0809229072	366019839	Static Contraction Training	Books	1	72	79	N	Y	Not worth the effort.	This is a workout system involving holding very heavy weights in a stationary position for a few seconds. There are several drawbacks you should consider before purchasing this book.  The first is that the book tries to get a little too scientific, and spends a little too much time on things like nutrition etc.  I wish they would have just focused on the workout.  The second drawback is that you must have access to a good power rack.  If you don't, then it could be dangerous.  The last and biggest drawback is that for this system to really work you need to have a strong partner.  That is the only way to actually get the heavy weights into position, and the only way to get an accurate time.  If you don't have a partner or a good power rack then you would be better off skipping this system.  One other thing I should mention is that the authors state that gaining strength in a static hold would transfer to a full range movement but I found that for myself it did not happen.  Overall if you have the necesarry things then you may want to try this and see how it works for you.  My own personal opinion however is that you would be better off sticking to a standard training system such as Wendler's 5/3/1.	2001-01-02

This book isn't really bad, but I would not call it a masterpiece.  The first problem is that it is really long.  I dont mind a long well written book, but this is not well written.  There are moments that the author takes pages when he should have used sentences.  This really sets up bad pacing.  Just when you start to get into it, he ends up rambling and destroying any momentum he had.  The other problem is that the plot is your standard peasant boy who is more than he seems to be goes on a quest to save the world.  But despite these shortcomings I am interested to see what happens next, and I guess you cannot ask for more than that.  Overall I would say that this is a better series to start than the wheel of time (you will actually be able to finish this series!).  Give it a try, you might like it.	2001-01-02

For anyone interested in lifting weights this is a book that you MUST own.  It covers pratically every topic that has to do with weight training, from nutrition to routine design to setting up your own home gym.  Some of the other reviewers mentioned that the book doesn't present any research.  That is a GOOD thing.  The book tells you what YOU need to do to make YOUR routine effective (effective meaning progressively increasing the weights.)  No amount of research can tell you that!  This book really goes in depth about how to make routines that work for you!!  Another reviewer mentioned that the book is repetitive, but it needs to be.  So many of us have been brainwashed by mainstream exercise experts that we need to have the truth repeated over and over again.  My last point is that the begining of the book states that you need to ready to reread and review the book.  I found that this was completely true, I am constantly rereading sections that deal with whatever is going on in my training.  This book is a weightlifting MASTERPIECE!	2001-01-02

I must say that I honestly do not know what the fuss is all about.  This book was average at best, with nothing that really set it apart from anything else out there in fantasy today.  I just do not see any reason to invest the amount of time it will take to finish this series.  Do not be fooled by the glorious reviews this book and the series in general has received.

It tries to be an action adventure murder mystery, set against the theories that jesus had children, and that the crusades were his children's attempt  to retake their rightful land.  The problems are that it does not develop  this theory enough to be plausible (ooh, a secret book explains it) to  those new to the field, but offers nothing new to anyone who has read up on  this stuff. If you are interested in the theory that jesus had children,  read holy blood holy grail.  If you have read that then stay away from this  book at all costs because you'll be bored.  On top that, the fiction  portion is as, if not even more, underdeveloped.  The characters are wooden  at best, and the plot is standard.  The other reviewers mention songs, but  who cares!  If you want poetry read frost.  Once again I offer this  warning, stay away!	2000-06-09
