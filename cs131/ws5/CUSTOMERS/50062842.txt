Ignore the age suggestions, because the older kids will love to read this one to their younger siblings.  There is SO much to take in with every picture, like each sheep having it's own signature item.  Kids will love spotting \\"MYLA, because she has the glasses\\", etc.....a true wonderland to explore.  Each drawing was made with great attention to detail and is a work of art in its own right.  Young and old will love this wonderful book.  A great gift idea, with a nice HAPPY ending.	2003-07-16

This was my first &quot;taste&quot; of the genre, and I have to say that I truely enjoyed it.  The book was a quick, easy read with plot twists and fantastic characters.  The heroine, Brandy, was the strongest and most self-identifiable female character I have seen since Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  The police and detective sequences made the book more enjoyable for &quot;novices&quot; like myself, and the storyline moved along at a great clip.  Thank you Ms. Lorrah for such an interesting read.....I am now hooked on the Vampire genre.	2003-07-16

The book had a surreal &quot;feel&quot; to it. It was in no way offensive or horror based,yet not like Disney and Barney(maybe 5-9 years of age would enjoy it best).  While &quot;counting bunnies&quot; with my kids....I found that there was MUCH more to be seen in each drawing, as SO typical of French's in depth drawings.  From the sheep fireflies, to the &quot;clean&quot; footsteps it was a delight to look for all of the humor in each page.  I especially liked the Lost and Found posters.  The main character of the Soap lady was not scary to my kids after I explained the real phenomonon to them....and she had a very &quot;motherly&quot; disposition which made her very endearing.  The book was complete with a moral lesson of befriending EVERYONE even if they are different, and was good CLEAN reading.  As always, Ms. French's drawings were the basis of the story and well worth every penny, beautiful illustrations.  Published by Top Shelf Productions Inc. it is one book that does NOT need to be on the top shelf.  Leave it out.  Let everyone enjoy this delightful picture book.	2001-08-16

The diaries were barely ledgible at times, according to the author, but were invaluable in terms of information.  Other sources for the book were &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts from the survivors of the journey, including Dr. Alexander H. Macklin.

Not only is the story told, but the atmosphere and emotions of the crew and their surroundings are shown, and one gets the feeling of what is was like for these men in the early 1900's adrift on ice packs and marooned on unliveable land for more than a years time. The story is well written, fast paced and tells several parts of the tale at different intervals during the book which makes it very easily followed.  If you enjoy historical accounts or are fascinated with Antartica itself....this is a must-read book.	2001-04-11

Not often do I read a book that leaves me speechless...or close to it.  While reading this tale I found myself crying more often than not, and reevaluating the &quot;needs&quot; in my life.  Not only was it a tale of how the South Pole can change your life, from needs to the way you look at reality, but it was the story of a courageous woman's struggle.  The book was well written and had email letters that she sent as well as ones that she received and often they told the story better than an author could.  It was these letters from family and friends that usually brought me to tears.  Just when I thought I knew what bravery and courage are....the book helped me redefine the words.  It is one thing to look death in the face when you get news of a cancerous tumor in your body, but quite another when you learn that you have to treat yourself and there is no way to send physician help to you.  The book was frank and to the point with concise terminology that was easily translated to laymans terms.  If you want a sad but ultimately uplifting story, or have loved ones facing the terrible disease of breast cancer, then this book is a must read.  I highly recommend this one for ALL women (and men).	2001-04-01

The first two books in this series had me in stitches, but after I finished the third one, I realized that they just keep getting better.  The same quirky characters are in volume three, and Evanovich developed some of my favorite ones right down to every funny detail.  The capers in this book are more elaberate, laugh out loud funny, and keep you wanting more.  Stephanie Plum's character is so strikingly like the everyday woman, and it is a joy to read of &quot;normal&quot; problems one would encounter as a &quot;bounty hunter&quot;.  Some of the scenes are unforgettable and have you rolling in your seat (Cluck in the Bucket, and freeway chase scenes to be exact).  I can't wait to read the rest in the series and I hope Ms. Evanovich continues the Stephanie Plum series for a long while to come.  Who couldn't relate to Stephanie's  less than normal family members???!!!!  A great novel, especially for the beach.	2001-03-16

It is geared for perhaps the schoolaged child, with the meaning a good one, but hard to grasp for little minds.  The story is about the environment and what we can do to protect it, a message that is never too late to teach.  The list of endangered or extinct animals at the end of the book will probably grow each and every year.  A good book for the animal lover in your family.	2001-02-15

Indianapolis, the Navy's Greatest Sea Disaster	Books	4	14	15	N	N	True account of a Terrible Tragedy	The story of the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, is a sad memoire of senseless loss of life during war time.  The first half of this book goes into details about the ship itself, the crew and even the frame of mind of the enemy submarines captain that torpedoed the Indianapolis.  The hours and days that following the sinking were documented on the pages as well as statements made by survivors.  The second half of the book recounts the proceedings of the court martial of the Indianapolis' Captain, McVay.  So many things went wrong ,from the search and rescue,to the speed of the sinking and the inability of officers to call for &quot;abandon ship&quot;.  Of the 800 some odd men that made it off the ship, only slightly more than 300 survived the ordeal, which is what the book is here to explain.  A good narative with shocking revelations, it's a fast and easy read.	2001-01-24

As with Bill Bryson's accounts in the great outdoors, Greenlaw has the knack for simple explanations for complicated things, making swordfishing something that the &quot;average Joe&quot; can enjoy.  The book is informative but hysterical at times, a real pleasure to read.  I have not read &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; yet, but after seeing the movie I am in better understanding of the workings of the trade.  Greenlaw's experiences explained even the simple questions like &quot;what in the world do you need glo-sticks for?&quot;  Since we know that the &quot;Andria Gail&quot; in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; never makes it back to the dock, the inferences for the book and film had to come from SOMEWHERE.  It is quickly obvious that many came from the &quot;Hannah Boden&quot; herself, lending portraits of a swordboat crew right down to the 20 pound lasagna mentioned in the film.  I caught myself laughing out loud on many occasions and thoroughly enjoyed this book.  One of my favorite segments is about sealore superstitions (ie. pork/pigs, women on boat, the number thirteen, whistling to oneself, and blue or yellow hulls),in which she ends the segment commenting on how she should get a blue boat and name it &quot;Thirteen Whistling Pigs&quot;.   A great book for those who love the sea and those who would just like to learn more about it.  They say that seamen tell the best tales, and I would have to agree in this case.....I highly recommend this easy reading book.	2001-01-24

They have alot of similarities, but this book is a true story.  It contains a history lesson, as well as a horrifyingly suspenseful story of a sunken submarine.  To learn that ANY of the men survived is truely a miracle.  Some of the most disturbing occurances happen AFTER the survivors are rescued.  A great book that is well written and well worth the time to read.....I commend the author on a job well done.	2001-01-09

It is one of our favorite books now, for my children ranging in age from 2 to 6.  It is a fairly easy reader for my six year old and the beautiful watercolor pictures and poetic verse keep their interest.  I have since put this book on my Christmas list for all my young readers to receive.  It is a great addition to our night time reading ritual.	2000-11-30

US	50062842	R4VPT4DJI2N1A	038081093X	604551094	Excavation	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Hot and Cold	This was the first book I have read by this author and can not compare it to the other.  I CAN say that the Indiana Jones type booby traps and hidden caverns were interesting and suspenceful.  The naratives in between and the lack of depth of the characters failed to pique my interest.  Which means I found it easy to put down and hard to get back into, especially due to extremely long chapters that had no &quot;good&quot; spot to leave off on.  I can say that the more that I read, the more I enjoyed it.  I learned about the ancient indians and some lore, etc. of the period.  Giving this book three stars was due to the fact that I have read MUCH better books of suspence by authors Lincoln and Childs and feel that this one does not deserve to be in their ranks.  I beleive that if this book was read all in one sitting it would have been a much better novel. If you enjoy the writings of the above mentioned authors, and the action packed suspence of Indiana Jones and the Lost Arc, then you may want to check this one out.  The underground scenes were very discriptive and easily pictured....it has &quot;coming to a theater near you&quot; written all over it!!!!  All and all not too bad of a read.	2000-10-17

It was so hysterical that I lost track of time  while reading it.  It reminded me very much of the same style of writing  that Jon Krakauer has.  If you enjoyed books like &quot;Eiger dreams&quot;  by Krakauer, then you will love this one.  It was the first book of Brysons  that I have read and I plan on getting the rest as well.  It not only told  the story of an unlikely pair on the Appalacian Trail, but also histories  of some states, ecology lessons, small town descriptions and even a lesson  on Stonewall Jackson.  It is easy to PICTURE the author and his friend in  all of the situations mentioned in the book, and even easier to LAUGH at  them.  You can't help but pity these guys and wonder exactly how they were  able to make it home alive.  If you are ready for a great read that perks  up your day....grab this one and enjoy.	2000-09-17

If you are hiking on the Appalacian trail or doing hikes up the  various peaks in New Hampshire, Vermont or Maine ,then you will want to  read this first.  It tells of mishaps (including several deaths), and of  terrain and weather conditions of the various peaks.  An example is Mt.  Washington in New Hampshire , where the bad conditions are second only to  those of Mt. Denali in Alaska.  If this book doesn't scare you out of  hiking in New England, then it will definetly prepare you for what lies  ahead!!!

If you are a fan of this pair of authors and enjoyed all of their works so  far....get ready to sit down with one of their best.  The latest release  from Preston and Childs is very much like their earlier  work,&quot;Riptide&quot;.  They both had similar plots , searching for a  mysterious treasure on a desolate island, and similar characters as well.   The book was a bit more intriguing , however ,and moved along at a very  fast clip.  The characters were strangly similar to those in &quot;Jurassic  Park&quot;, (mathemetician,an old collecter, scientists and archeological  experts).  The main differences in this book is the main &quot;  character&quot; is a metiorite, and there are alot of seabound scenes that  got you downright seasick.  It had a ton of action and suspence and  provoked your interest in the lead characters beyond just what they were  doing on the mission.  I am amazed at how the authors always seem to  &quot;get you lost&quot; in  their books, and they never fail to  disappoint.  If it's a great suspence novel you seek...check this one out.	2000-09-04

Tender Branson was somehow lacking in  intensity compared to Tyler and the Fight Club character(s).  This book DID  have the same attitude (satiristic) and the same overtones(anarchist) as  the first book.  The main character of Survivor, Tender ,was sort of  Betty  Crocker meets McGuyver , and it didn't seem to come off as well as maybe  the author had planned.  There was nothing lacking in the way this book was  written, however, and I really enjoyed how the book &quot;counted  down&quot; to Tender's ultimate demise.  The book certainly wasn't a bad  effort by the author, I just wish that I could have FELT for the characters  as much as I had in the Fight Club.  There were no plot twists or surprise  endings....this book was straight foward and blunt.  A good read if you  enjoyed Chuck Palahniuk's other works, as it contains the same  not-so-subtle humor and Anarchist references.	2000-08-03

I like historical books and was really amazed at the semitic  overtones in the south during the civil war.  As stated by reveiwer C.  Ellen, it was written well and put into context with other goings on in  that period.  Being from Atlanta myself, I could very easily relate to the  narative and it held my facination throughout.  It told what I beleive to  be the complete story and facts as well as being updated for NEW release in  1987 by adding an additional preface.  Anyone who is interested in civil  war reads, the laws of the time , or who lives in or around Atlanta , will  be interested in this book.  Over 50 pages of it are dedicated to the  bibliography and all facts are well documented.  It is a story that is all  to reminiscent of famous cases that have arrisen in the past few years.   It's a sad commentary on just how far the attitudes of this nation have  come in the past 100 years or so.  If interested in further information  after reading this book, then I suggest trying to contact the Atlanta  Journal Constitution for their brilliant account of the incident in the  June 11, 2000 addition of their paper.  It also gives a partial list of the  lynching mob, held in secretcy until this time.  A great book to own for  any historical book collection.	2000-07-06

Actually it was more like a nightmare.  Imagine being trapped on a motorway  island for weeks and not having the strength to get off of it.  Try THIS  one on that &quot;Survivor&quot; show!   The characters in the story were  not very complex but the story moved along and there was enough going on to  compensate for that.  It showed exactly to what lengths one would go if  faced with being marooned on a concrete island.    It was just under 200  pages and a short read by anyones standards....a good book to take on a  vacation.  That is as long as you don't plan to spend time on any deserted  islands!   The ending to the book was a bit of a letdown, but it leaves  things open for a sequel, but how interesting would these characters be in  NORMAL situations?   If you enjoy reading the likes of Chuck Palahniuk, and  Alex Garland...then you'll probably like this one enough to give it 4 stars  also.	2000-06-29

It was one of the few books that I've read that has had a moral lesson as well as a great plot( romance , suspense,etc.) It makes you think about your own daily life and how  little things  can make a huge impact, if not in your life,then in others'.  If one small act of kindness can lead to world peace, then what are we  waiting for?   If everyone who reads this book pays it foward ,then  the  world will become a better place.  The book was well written and easy to  follow, by giving each character it's own chapters.  The premise of the  story was very beleivable and the surprise ending was one you won't soon  forget.  I needed a box of tissues for the ending of the book and couldn't  imagine what a movie of this impact would do to me!   The book also had  humor injected at opportuned times....I especially like the conversation  between Trevor and the President when they first met.  It is definetly a   &quot;feel good book&quot;, and should be recommended reading for every  young person out there.....for they are the hope of the future.  My eyes  are already peeled for those in need so that I can pay it foward myself.   Do not miss reading this book!	2000-06-23

I saw in the one reveiw that the rights were already picked up to be a movie...I'm not surprised.  Can you say , Bruce Willis?   It was very much a Die Hard kind of action and  suspense book and the actual sequence that the title refers to was  absolutely brilliant.  I got a flashback of McGuyver during the stairwell  scene....it was inguineous.  The pace kept up through the whole book and  had a beleiveable plot.  It kept you guessing what was real and what wasn't  throughout.  The way it was written gave insight into the main characters  mind and levied a little humor at his expense.  It was refreshing to read a  book that kept you both interested and chuckling.  I definetly would  recommend it to all my action fan friends.	2000-06-08

I found this book and haven't missed using it a week since I got it.  It is  great not only for the healthy recipes, but for how the recipes compare to  fatty ones and taste even better in my opinion.  They are pretty easy to  make and range from cakes and goodies to detailed Italian meals.  It also  gives you a selection of the same dish( ie. several kinds of lasagna to  choose from).  Recipes are easy to find and several have enticing photos to  encourage you to try them.  A &quot;must have&quot;in the kitchen.

Aparently , I was wrong.  The RELIC team has done it again, making  my stomach turn and chills return to my spine.  This was such a page  turner, I got frustrated every time I had to put it down.  The writing  style was similar to JURASIC PARK , the way it described computer data and  internal workings.  The characters, to me, were similar to those in JAWS,  where you almost KNEW which ones would meet their demise....and the action  packed, booby trapped pit scenes were reminecent of INDIANA JONES.  Add to  that all the startling elements of the RELIC and you can't go wrong.  It is  by far one of the best books Iv'e read so far this year.  Technically  stimulating, yet fast paced and enjoyable to read.  I'll give it 6 more  months before the rights are picked up for a blockbuster hit movie!	2000-05-23

You can definetly tell that it was written a while back and with a British flare,but I have  to say that the suspense parts were rather predictable.  I loved the  characters,even the one's you weren't SUPPOSED to like and I think that was  the best part about the book.  You walk away feeling sorry for Tom and  being totally annoyed with Dickie when it should be the other way around.  In that aspect the writing was great.  The suspense could use a boost but  all in all it was a pretty interesting book.  If you like Agatha Christie  and some of the other authors of that time, you'll enjoy this book.	2000-05-17

If you want a vertually indistructable  text that they will sit still and listen to, or read themselves....start  clicking that mouse.  I plan to buy another half dozen or more before the  year is out.  What better gift than that of reading to a small child!	2000-05-05
US	50062842	RVHDILPX6IT37	0805062971	311054036	Fight Club: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	strangely unique	I haven't seen the movie...so I won't make comparisons.  This book is in a word...UNIQUE.  I can't really describe it otherwise.  It has a great plot twist that makes you want to reread the entire text to see how it lead up  to that point.  Just as you are starting to wonder where this story is  going, it hits you in the face (no pun intended) and does a 180.  It was  written well,and kept your interest peaked as well as having some strange  comedic interludes.  Not a book for everyone, especially if you are anti  gun, fight, or bomb oriented....but then why would you consider something  called The Fight Club if you were, right?  OK...check it out for a fast and  enjoyable read.	2000-04-28

I had read reveiws saying it was lacking this and that and making references to the poorly staged scenes in Manila.  WHO CARES ABOUT THE LOCATION!  I couldn't.  The characters and tie ins to  each subsequent &quot;chapters&quot; and subsections were brilliant and I  caught myself anticipating them at every turn.  The story wasn't as in  depth as The Beach, but it read easily, quickly, and every part had it's  purpose.  Just when I thought he couldn't tie a character or scene to a  previous one ,Mr. Garland did...and in the present AND the past!   I was  amazed at how it all fit together, and was equally as pleased with the  ending.  The last subsection has each character &quot;wrapping up&quot;  their role in the whole sceme of things, and it doesn't leave you wondering  what just happened as in some suspense stories.  After I finished the last  sentence, I actually had to sit there for a minute, ponder the book, and  say... WOW.  Maybe not the best STORY in the world, but one that you really  shouldn't miss reading.	2000-04-19
US	50062842	R2KY4V1VTL1V0Z	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	0	0	N	N	subtle humor makes an unpleasant topic a great book	The best thing about this book is the characters.  They are all so beleivable and you sympathize with them and feel their emotions...a sign of great writing.  I think the thing I like most about this book is that it has a bit of subtle himor thrown in.  My favorite line in this book, or any  other , is when Scout says &quot; Pass the damn ham, please&quot;  at the  dinner table.  Just an example of the depth of the characters.  Atticus is  one of the best father figures I have ever seen.  My good friend is named  Jean Louise and to this day I still call her Scout.  That is how much I  love this book....an all time favorite, with a great message for everyone.	2000-04-06
US	50062842	RWEC7II12MJFE	0812564375	666062148	Mount Dragon	Books	4	2	3	N	N	a little too close to home	This book was very well written and even though I ,personally, didn't like it as much as &quot;The Relic&quot;, it was very involved and technical thus making it extremely beleivable.  I live just a hop, skip, and a jump  from the CDC and it scares me to think that some of the things mentioned in  this book could, and may be happening.  It is a slow reading book , in my  opinion, but only due to the amount of information given about the  projects, buildings etc., which help make the book what it is.  Definetly a  good book to sit down with when you have lots of time on your hands.  It  would be better if you were to read it all in one sitting (easier to  follow).  Check it out.	2000-04-04
US	50062842	RW21JYWQMN1OV	1573226521	117734468	The Beach	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Don't see the movie first!	I have yet to see the movie, but it couldn't possibly do this book justice.  The way it was written gave a very unique perspective into the ,well, not so straight mind of a young traveller.  It struck me immediately  of a cross between a modern day &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; with a bit of  &quot;American werewolf inLondon&quot; thrown in (in the form of a  reoccurring vision of a dead accquaintance).  I have three small children  at home and I still finished it in less than 2 weeks....a major feat for  me!   Non stop action will keep you reading. A definite keeper....hope the  movie can measure up.  READ THE BOOK FIRST.	2000-03-27
US	50062842	RAXWS9MD6JZOP	0812543262	584815540	Relic (Pendergast, Book 1)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	definetly worth the time	Although this book may not be for everyone, it definetly is written far better than most thrillers that I've read.  There is a subplot beyond just a scary &quot;monster&quot; and although it takes some time to get into and  a few instances of  over thinking a scene, it makes you feel like you are  really there.  The setting couldn't be any more perfect and it's very easy  to imagine that you are trapped in the basement.  I caught the hairs on my  neck raising a few times.  It's definetly a book that I will be rereading  again in the near future, and is quite a bit better than its sequel.  The  movie did not come close to doing it justice...read it and decide for  yourself.	2000-03-27
