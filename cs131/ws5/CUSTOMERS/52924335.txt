They describe the life of one man, from adolescence to maturity, who lives in a world peopled with kings, warriors, fantastical creatures and all of the things that readers of fantasy have come to love and identify with.  <br /> <br />One slight twist: Vanyel, the story's protagonist, just happens to be gay. <br /> <br />From the titles, the stories obviously have to do with magic and the people who wield it. Lackey writes with great passion, and it is her love for the world she's created in these books that makes them worthwhile. Her system of magic isn't overly complex, but it is well thought out, and has appeal to a wide range of readers. <br /> <br />Rather than focusing on epic battles and the machinations of vast armies, Lackey concentrates on character development and interpersonal relationships. One gets a sense that she spent time getting to know each character and giving that character a piece of herself. <br /> <br />The first book deals with Vanyel's coming of age. I won't go into detail, because spoiling the plot is hardly the point of a reader review. I will say that where Lackey fails is that she sometimes is reduced to the overly dramatic. When something slightly funny happens, the characters shove fists in mouths to keep from laughing, and can barely stand up for fear of splitting sides. When something bad happens, it's always the worst thing imaginable. But such is adolescence, and one comes to enjoy Vanyel's strengths, be annoyed with his faults and earnestly hope he will mature. Which he does. <br /> <br />Aside from creating a very competent feel for magic use, from the perspective of a reader of fantasy, the plots to each of the three stories are interesting and well written. The plots move, rather than just serving as an excuse for another writer to extrapolate upon what she thinks magicis. <br /> <br />On top of all of that, a love story that touches the heart, if you're a reader who enjoys that sort of thing. <br /> <br />Mercedes Lackey writes with grace and style. If you are a reader of fantasy who enjoys works by writers such as Anne McCaffrey or Terry Brooks, the Last Herald Mage series is definitely something you should consider putting on your reading list.	2005-08-15
US	52924335	R31F8CQHN47MXO	0452284570	345670700	Entanglement	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A Great Introduction	Amir Aczel's book \\"Entanglement\\" is a great introduction to the subject for the non-physicist, or the future physicist, in my case. As someone who is just starting out with his studies in physics, it was great to have the chance to read a book on a very complicated subject, written for a much wider audience than simply the people who work in that field.<br /><br />Aside from the strangeness of the concept of entanglement itself, what I found fascinating was how the interplay of personalities, professional rivalries and the general direction of the field of physics lead to the startling suggesting of entanglement in the first place.<br /><br />I applaud Aczel's accomplishment. It isn't easy to make something as strange as entanglement understandable to a scientifically untrained audience, but he has done so exceptionally well. This is much more a book about the history of the players involved than it is about the science itself, though both subjects are touched on with great style. A fascinating and entertaining read	2005-03-20

Taking place far away from the more familiar setting of Ankh-Morpork, the story centers on the struggle for religious freedom, and the difference between truth and perception.    Through absolutely no fault of his own, Brutha, a novice in the church of Omnia, has the misfortune of meeting his God as a voice inside his own head. Whereas the church is one of persecution, power grabbing and torture, Brutha is a peace-loving individual, slow in thought and imagination. He is ill prepared for meeting a deity. Om, his God, isn't having a very good day either.    Practchett utilizes his unique sense of humor and the setting of Discworld, to satire modern culture and popular thought. In \\"Small Gods\\", the issues tackled are religion, fanaticism and the drive for power. Whereas all of the Discworld books are funny, \\"Small Gods\\" is both funny and extremely thought provoking, with perhaps the hint of a message.     The book isn't quite as silly as, for instance, \\"Reaper Man\\", but there is plenty of the traditional silliness throughout. No need to lose one's sense of humor when making a point. Pratchett manages with style. (The guide to Discworld at the back is pretty fun, as well.)	2004-12-31

After reading it, I'm sure I'll read the rest of his work at some point. It's just too nice to find a new (to me) SF author I enjoy to not seek out the rest of his books. <br /> <br />\\"Moving Mars\\" is a very apt title, because this novel is about just that, on several different levels: politically, socially, physically moving Mars. The story follows the budding career of Casseia Majumdar, from lowly student protestor to high powered political official, and what Casseia has to do to help secure a world eager for its own governance, rather than living in the shadow of the mother planet. <br /> <br />Bear creates very believable characters and delves into political and scientific areas very comfortably. Clearly, this is a writer that does his research. There were a couple of technical issues I had with the book. Not anything I thought was wrong - Bear is much more of an expert on the subject than I, I'm sure. Really, it was more a case of unanswered questions. Questions that I can't ask here without offering major spoilers. Still, the few questions I did have were minor in comparison to the quality and thoroughness of the story. <br /> <br />What I really like about Bear is that he doesn't wave a magic wand to make everything better. He gets his characters into tough situations and then works his way through those situations honestly. His writing is reminiscent of some of the SF giants: Heinlein, Asimov, Herbert - without being self-congratulatory or stuffy.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend the book to anyone looking for SF with good science and a solid story behind it.	2004-12-07

Beginning as a newspaper column, Maupin had the idea to allow reads to direct the story to a certain extent. They would write in to tell him how the story should go, and he would decide which idea he liked best. So I've heard, at least. <br /> <br />These books are filled with rich characters. Mr. Maupin was excellent at drawing readers into his stories by making sure that the people one found in them were people one would want to know. They seemed not only real in that they were multi-faceted personalities of their own, but real in that they were surrounded by the events and culture of the 70's, which were beautifully captured.  <br /> <br />Someone reading the books now, when stumbling across a reference to LeCar or Jim Jones, will be transported back in time. Readers not old enough to remember the 70s will get a good glimpse of what gay culture was like then... or a part of it, at least. <br /> <br />Maupin's characters experience situations that just about everyone can relate to. There are also situations that are extraordinary, but it's the day to day that make Mouse, Anna Madrigal and the rest seem like the folks who live next door. The \\"28 Barbary Lane\\" volume includes the first three books in the series. It's a wonderfully rich read. Not complicated or highbrow, perhaps, but not all stories should be. This is one of those \\"curl up next to the fire\\" books and I can't imagine my collection being without it.	2004-10-20

She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.     How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.    Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.    Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.    There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.     I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.    Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie.	2004-10-11

I tore through the first four books with utter delight. After hearing the ridiculous amount of controversy surrounding these works, I was prepared for shoddy writing and nefarious, subversive pseud-literature. Obviously, I found neither. <br /> <br />\\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is indeed darker than its predecessors. This book isn't intended for five year olds, and I see no reason why good children's literature full of suspense, magic and a bit of thrill shouldn't be available. Thank goodness J.K.

As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.<br /><br />Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.<br /><br />Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.<br /><br />Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time.	2004-09-26

Jill Connor Browne is back with the third installment in her Sweet Potato Queens series, dedicated to just plain having fun with life. Amid stories of heartbreak and triumph, Jill includes recipes guaranteed to fatten up even Kate Moss and Callista Flockheart. <br /> <br />What's more, there's lots of bacon! And cheese. Don't let us forget the cheese. <br /> <br />Do we despise Jill for taking such a stern stance against aerobics and plastic surgery, only to find out that she herself is a personal trainer who has had \\"some work done\\"? Heck no! A queen can change her mind, after all. And there's nothing wrong with a bit of waffling... especially with lots of butter and syrup. <br /> <br />This is my favorite installment to date. Not only do we learn more about what the Queens are really like, particularly Jill herself, but we get to try a whole bunch of recipes that are just...well, they're just not right.

I've heard several friends report this as the once instance where a film has surpassed the original book, but I can't agree, as much as I like the film. <br /> <br />Dick is of the old school. His writing is straightforward, and his emphasis is on the storytelling, rather than on the setting. Even so, some of the elements that pop up in \\"Androids\\" are sufficiently unique and ahead of their time. <br /> <br />The central question of the book is: Where does artificial intelligence end and humanity begin? Dick doesn't answer the question, but he definitely explores it in depth through the experiences of his characters and their startling interactions. <br /> <br />\\"Androids\\" remains one of the classic SF novels of all times. There is a reason that so many successful films have been made from Dick's novels and short stories. He was a visionary writer who transcended his genre. Here is Philip K.

Reminiscent of Gibson, Stephenson re-modernizes some cyberpunk elements and gives them his own twists. <br /> <br />Lighter than Cryptonomicon and much more fun than Diamond Age, Snow Crash is just plain fun, one of the things that's been missing from the SF scene, as far as I'm concerned. YT, Hiro and the rest of the characters go from problem to problem, suspenseful situation to suspenseful situation.  <br /> <br />There's lots in here that other writers have addressed, but Stephenson definitely puts his own stamp on this genre. This book is worth the read for the first chapter alone. It may get a bit slower afterward, but not by much. This is not a heavy or dense book, and may be Stephenson's most accessible work. I'd recommend it to SF fans of all ages.	2004-09-25

As a student, I read so much non-fiction as part of daily life that I really seek an escape when it comes to my private time. So, when Richard Corfield came to speak at the University of Washington, I wasn't expecting to spend the next several days pouring over his book. <br /> <br />\\"The Silent Landscape\\" outlines the voyage of the HMS Challenger, one of the most important sea voyages to date. Not only does Corfield outline the voyage, he stops along the way, and punctuates the discoveries of the Challenger crew with brilliant descriptions of the technology used at the time, the personal trials undertaken by the crew, and the conditions of life aboard the ship. <br /> <br />Students of oceanography will no doubt be familiar with the Challenger. Anyone with even the remotests interest in the subject would do well to read this book. Not only informative, Corfield's writing style is pleasant and the layout of the work economical and extremely well done.	2004-09-25

Building on the mistrust of secret societies, \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" deals with masonry, the Knights Templar and the whole Golden Dawn set as the central focus of this mystery. <br /> <br />The story is satisfying, but I can't help wondering if it would have been so had I not had some background in the subject matter. There are places where one just wishes he would get on with it, already, rather than painstakingly building his case. <br /> <br />The characters run together a bit, but the general writing style and plot promote thought and interest in the story and where it's going. This novel is great as an airport read, ignoring some of the background, or as a wickedly intelligent look at the slightly paranoid mindset.	2004-09-25

Understated and sly, she manages to portray the inner wit and wisdom of early 18th century upper-class English women quite well. The choice is never to marry or not. The choice is always whom to marry and why.    Unlike her other works, Northanger Abbey is a satire on the gothic \\"horror\\" novel so prevalent at the time. Full of suspenseful build-ups and hysterical interruptions, the story revolves around Catherine Morland, as unlikely a heroine as ever graced the pages. Amid the story, Ms. Austen interrupts with witty attacks on Mrs. Radcliffe and other gothic novelists.    As always, Austen's humor is stylish and full of truths. She was perhaps a much happier forerunner to Dorothy Parker, in that she cut right through the sheen and told it like it was, as she knew it.    I'd recommend Northanger Abbey to anyone who enjoys Austen's writings, gothic novels, or sly humor.	2004-09-25

He's one of the best writers to come on the SF scene for quite some time, at least that I've been exposed to. Snow Crash is one of the most fun books I've ever read. Cryptonomicon, one of the most thorough and complex. <br /> <br />That said, Diamond Age falls somewhat short of the other two works, in my estimation. Relying heavily on the latest version of \\"magic\\", nanotechnology, the story is interesting, but didn't grip me the way his other books have. Frankly, nano-tech as a be all and end all for SF is over done. Some of Stephenson's technological ideas are great, others are just silly. <br /> <br />This is a fairly fun book to read. Stephenson has become one of the largest names in the field, and there's a reason for it. The man can write. I recommend Diamond Age to anyone who would like an above average light read.	2004-09-25

Instead, I found a book full of unbelievably shallow and sacharine characters with little to no appeal.     Aside from the circus setting, I found the two main characters so stereotypically sappy as to be laughable in all the wrong places. I felt insulted at every turn of the page as the two boys/men toggled between love and hatred of themselves and each other.    Admittedly, I'm no fan of Bradley's writing, and \\"The Catch Trap\\" is the perfect example of why. While I understand from many a friend I've discussed this with that I'm of a minority opinion here, I can't help but recommend that this book NOT be read...by anyone.	2004-09-25

She hones in on particular words - preternatural comes to mind - far too often, and her descriptions of places and things seem clunky and formulaic. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Interview\\" was really a breakthrough novel. Written for all of us who watched vampire movies hoping that Dracula would somehow escape at the end, Rice tapped into a vital element of the subconscious: that part that is obsessed with dying or not dying, mortality and immortality. <br /> <br />While I can't recommend her style of writing, as a storyteller, Rice was top notch - especially for the first three books of the Vampire Chronicles. \\"Interview\\" and \\"Lestat\\" are parts of the same story, told from different points of view, and then \\"Queen\\" continues that story. <br /> <br />Rice never shies away from boundaries, stretching her characters as far as her imagination allows her to take them. She brushes on issues of theology, philosophy and society in ways that really resonate with lots of people. One of the reasons her books continue to be so popular. <br /> <br />Were it not for \\"Body Thief\\" a story I found so annoyingly cliche and unreadable as to be nearly worthless, I would have given this series four stars, since the plusses of Rice's imagination typically outweigh the shortcomings of her writing. For my money, the series could have stopped after \\"Queen of the Damned\\" with the possible exception of \\"Memnoch the Devil\\".	2004-09-25

Delany. The second would definitely be Gibson's \\"Neuromancer\\". There is simply no finer example of the SF novel, for my money. <br /> <br />First published in 1984, when I was still recovering from Fortran and BASIC programming courses in high school, Gibson's visionary work spawned the cyberpunk genre single-handedly. His stark writing style, coupled with an extremely bright mind and vivid imagination still strikes me with its beauty on every re-read, and this is a novel I read often. <br /> <br />Gibson has a way of bringing forth a deeply real mental image by sketching the outline of a scene and then focusing in on a slight detail, something trivial, that always amazes me. I've continued to be a fan of Gibson through his other works, but this is the best of the best. <br /> <br />	2004-09-25
US	52924335	R3L3683H6H90NZ	0441816525	199419133	Tomoe Gozen (Tomoe Gozen Saga)	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Excellent Saga	The Tomoe Gozen saga, consisting of \\"Tomoe Gozen\\", \\"The Golden Naginata\\" and \\"Thousand Shrine Warrior\\" is an excellent piece of fiction set in an alternate universe - one where magic exists and works, where monsters, devils, spirits and gods exist and intercede in human affairs.    In Naipon, that universe's version of Japan, Tomoe Gozen, a female samurai, battles to retain her sense of honor and self.    Salmonson writes vivid character descriptions, but the style is at times a bit flat. Mostly, this seems due to the tale occurring from the point of Tomoe, who puts her bushido before her own wants and needs. Very rarely, that flatness interferes (I think) with the storytelling. Still, this is a tremendously underrated work and I always love recommending it to people who are at all interested in epic fantasy.	2004-09-25
US	52924335	R1H7WHOIT2MOC4	0345350499	627223385	The Mists of Avalon	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A fun read	\\"Mists\\" is one of the few MZB books I've been able to make it through, and I enjoyed the read. Exploring the Arthurian legend (for legend it definitely was) from the perspective of the women involved, Bradley weaves a marvelous tapestry of magic, intrigue and religious persecution. <br /> <br />Up to a point.  <br /> <br />As always, I find Bradley's treatment of the male character condescending and ham handed. Many of her male characters are trite, throw-away and without any depth whatsoever. Nevertheless, the story is beautifully done, and the perspective on the legend of Arthur is unique. <br /> <br />One can safely ignore the sequels to this work... I found them horrid, almost beyond recognition as originating from the same writer. \\"Mists\\", however, is delightful and interesting, if thin in places. In all fairness, I can't give this work any more than 3 stars, though perhaps it deserves more for imagination.	2004-09-25

You know the kind. You read and read, and things are good, but nothing is new, nothing is exciting. Then a friend drops a book into your hands, by someone you've never read before. You start the book, hoping against hope, and within a couple of pages you're hooked. <br /> <br />This is how it happened for me and \\"The Anubis Gates\\". A mix of Egyptian mythology and time travel? Heck yeah! Where do I sign up? Aside from a fresh mixture of the known and the unknown, Powers' prose is great fun to read.	2004-09-25
US	52924335	R1OPL6CPWZG8EP	0802151574	651944367	Querelle	Books	4	8	10	N	N	An Interesting Read	\\"Querelle\\" is the only exposure I have had to Genet's work, and this only after watching the excellent Fassbinder film adaptation. I can honestly say I probably won't read him again, if this is an example of his prose. Heart-stoppingly beautiful in places, I found \\"Querelle\\" to be an absolutely bleak fictional reality.    Genet's writing style is unique - dense and multi-directional, someone definitely worthy of the name he has obtained. Probably a good deal underrated in the US as well. As impressed as I was, Genet failed to hook me as a reader. Other reviewers have compared Genet to Dostoevsky. I don't enjoy Dostoevsky's writing at all, so perhaps Genet just isn't my speed. Still, a great work is a great work, and I think this is at least a very good one.    I think \\"Querelle\\" is an important work, which is why I give it 4 stars despite my misgivings. I'd recommend this book to readers who are looking for something way off the beaten path. Provocative and full of texture, this book is an excellent character study and WILL excite a reaction from those readers for whom character study is a main objective.	2004-09-25

I may have stopped laughing long enough to grab a bite to eat or mix a drink. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is even better. <br /> <br />Sedaris, in his own charming, self-deprecating way, tackles living in a foreign country, a childhood speech impediment, and the difficult subject of being gay (without making it the center of his works) delightfully. His wit - dry in places, far from dry in others - and charm shine through in every story. <br /> <br />Really, the best part of these stories is that just about every one of us can relate to most of them. Strange neighbors, childhood traumas, etc. Sedaris proves that every life is interesting and full of memories. I can't wait for more. <br />	2004-09-25

The interaction between Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, always bring the smile to one's face. The problem is, once one has read a handful of the over thirty stories in this collection alone, everything else is simply repetition.<br /><br />Wodehouse's characters are two dimensional at best. These stories are definitely intended as very light reading, as a glance through the \\"other books written by\\" page in this volume suggests: There are 93 books by this author. 93! That doesn't include the omnibuses.<br /><br />Wodehouse's writing is complete fluff, yet charming fluff at that. I certainly couldn't read more than two or three of these short stories at a sitting. This is definitely library or used book material.	2004-09-25

Every time I open this book, I sit back on the couch with a glass of wine and feel like I'm curling up with a good friend. An outrageous, big-haired, loudmouthed friend, bless her heart.    Amid recipes involving bacon and far too much cheese, Browne delights with a philosophy of self-love in the best possible sense. Clearly, her family and friends are the most important things in the world to her, and next comes getting the most out of life one possibly can.    Contrary to popular opinion, one need not be from the South, have big hair or even be a woman (Hi, George!) to be a Sweet Potato Queen. The love of a good drink and a solid appreciation for not doing jack - well, you know - are definite plusses, though.    Long live the Sweet Potato Queens!	2004-09-25

A friend who recommended this series to me said, \\"It's kind of like Tolkien, but without the throw away Boromir characters.\\" <br /> <br />Obviously, Kay and Tolkien will be compared and contrasted, since Kay helped compile The Silmarilion. Also, any writer who attempts a fantasy trilogy is bound to be compared to Tolkien at some point. I find his writing style remarkably dissimilar and enjoy both authors immensely. <br /> <br />What Kay does exceedingly well, is allow me to care greatly about his characters. I don't have to work at it, like I do with some writers. They have depth and unique personalities all their own. <br /> <br />Comparisons with Tolkien aside, I think The Summer Tree and its sequels are excellent reads for folks who want more from their fantasy than a rip-roaring hack and slash dungeon in literary form. These are GOOD books and they deserve to be enjoyed, savored and pondered. <br /> <br />The occasional overly romanticized situation between a couple of the characters, as well as an annoying writing tick (I won't give it away as it's most likely a pet peeve of my own) prevents me from giving this series five stars, but I'd give it 4.5 if I could. <br />	2004-09-24

I was given this book as a gift from my grandmother when it first came out, and it remains one of my prized possessions. <br /> <br />This is a delightful story about growing up, trusting, and most importantly, learning to rely on one's imagination and wits. While there are some serious themes to the book, and some suspenseful moments, this really is a romp; a book that children of almost all ages can enjoy - and many adults, too, I imagine. <br /> <br />Julie Andrews Edwards proves she can do a lot more than sing. If you are a fan of children's literature, or if you have a child, this is a must read. There are a lot of books I remember reading as a child, but this one stands out along with the Chronicles of Narnia and The Hobbit as one of the absolute best.	2004-09-24
US	52924335	R3BEQ4TD5NWXQV	0375706682	433261893	Dhalgren	Books	5	9	11	N	Y	The Ulysses of SF	Delany's masterpiece, arguably one of the most important sf books ever, goes forever. Dense and packed with unbelievabely thorough description, Dhalgren is more about the writing than the plot.    This is not a book for the casual science fiction reader. Nor is it a book to be tossed by lightly. It takes work to get through. The book demands your total attention, and asks that you work for the nuggets of story that you get from it. Dry and sometimes didactic, Delany isn't a writer for the masses, nor should he ever try to be.    Every time I make my way through Dhalgren, which I do every couple of years or so, I'm astounded by Delany's intelligence, talent and, well, genius. The man knows his craft, possibly more so than any other writer I've ever read. I could recommend that someone not familiar with Delany's works start off with \\"Nova\\" or \\"Triton\\", but nothing can compare one for the onslaught of \\"Dhalgren\\".     Still, there are places where one wishes Delany would just get to the point. At times, the book is just too thick, too dense and too much to deal with. There are particular passages that I look forward to every time I read through it, and others I dread coming across. How do you fault a writer for being too thorough, or too good?     This is not Delany's most outrageous book, by any stretch of the imagination. As others point out, Delany is a gay, African-American writer, a writer who truly paved the way for a whole new generation of speculative fiction. He is a master of his craft and, as such, no one should expect him to be follow the road of the cookie cutter plot. Delany has points to make with his writing, and Dhalgren touches on areas both comfortable and uncomfortable, erotic and stomach turning.    This is not an easy book, but it is a great one.	2004-09-24

A must read for anyone who likes to both think and giggle, preferably at the same time.	2004-09-23
