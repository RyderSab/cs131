Kimberly Hahn has recommended some sources which are Protestant -produced and anti-Catholic. There is an underlying tone of disapproval of traditional Catholic sources such as the baltimore Catechism which most homeschooling Catholic parents I know prefer to use.<BR>Just beware.

The treachery  of Castro and his henchmen and the suffering of the Cuban people cannot be hidden behind ideological lies. Huber Matos, who fought with Castro in the Sierra Maestra mountains, has bared it all. Let us rememebr this man, a revolutionary, imprisoned and savagely beaten by the revolution.

Here is a chance for young and old alike to face the impact the Nazi occupation had on The Netherlands. It is a fantastic tale of bravery and faith amid the inhumanity of the Nazi mentality and those who cooperated with them. We see how the Nazis courted a young man, known to be bad anyway, for the task of spying and informing on his neighbors. we see how even his own faily was afraid of this youth's power and its abuse. But, we also see the strength of the Dutch character as they suffered hunger , bombings and loss of life and property. Von Stockum has clearly exposed the evil of the Nazis but she has shown the courage of those who fought them. memorable and so appropiate after Sept. 11th.	2002-07-21

First, the theme of the book is repetitive. Perry repeats herself in describing the characters' backgrounds in bok after book. In this one, the descriptions wore thin so Perry fans might find this tedious. Second, the beginning of the book begins with an error in editing or in sloppy writing. A question asked of a character and answered gets repeated by another as if he had not been in the previous scene. Very sloppy. Third, the author's anti-catholic stab adds little to the main story and seems gratuitous. Blaming the catholic Church for everything seems to be in vogue among certain circles nowadays but here it had nothing to contribute to the story line. Skip this book. Get an earlier MONK novel from Perry and enjoy it instead.	2002-01-26

At long last, a book that will balance the current obession by anti-Catholics to destroy the reputation of the Church.<BR>In the current vogue of anti-Catholicism in the all kinds of media, the Church's role during the Second World War has come under close scrutiny. This scrutiny is not simply the result of historical curiosity but it has a hidden agenda. The enemies of the Roman Catholic Church need to find some kind of proof for anti-Semitism. Many of these writers are simply concerned with the eradication of Christian institutions . what more porwerfull weapon that an accusation of anti-Semitism?<BR>For the general public, these writers, and the companies that publish and commercialize their research, appear to be knights in shining armor. The public simply swallows their so-called research.<BR>Herein lies the tragedy of today's reader.<BR>But along comes Professor Marchione and she seeks to put a stop to this one-sided view of history. hers is a passionate defense of the the Church and one Pope in particular. Marchione's book marches as a breath of fresh air. what makes this book so powerful is that one only has to look at publications such as The New York Times during the Second World War to see praise after praise of the role of the Church in helping Jewish victims of the NAzi persecution. Perusals of other war time publications here and abroad also back up the NYT. It is sad to see how the NYT has changed!!!<BR>it is also sad to see how the American public is duped by writers spouting anti-catholic views...It seems that this is in vogue.

It is about animals and the hardships creatures encounter as a result of man's carelessness and selfihness.

When kindly people move into the house on Rabbit Hill, the pooor existence of the animals takes a definite turn for the better.  The humans are kind and are able to co-exist with all the different kinds of animals on their property.

The idea of looking into a homeschooling day for many different families attracted me to this book. Some of the families are wonderful, showing the sacrifice and love that is involved in homeschooling. The children are thriving in a wonderfully rich cultural environment. Other families disturbed me, especially some of the unschooling ones. Their leave-and-let-bloom attitude looked to me as bordering on educational neglect. I saw mothers more worried about chores than about math. I saw kids more worried about their next TV show and with little structure. I saw too many hours gone by with little to account for. The parent that used the TV show WISHBONE to jot it down on her journal as having done &quot;American Indian Legends&quot; with her kids is blatantly disguising her children's educational experience. This book is a wonderful introduction to the homeschooling lifestyle but it can also be a powerful weapon for those in the educational establishment (myself as a teacher included) who are gearing their claws for attacking homeschooling. On the average, homeschooling children perform above their otherwise schooled counterparts but we also know that there must be exceptions. The book was interesting but it disturbed me as well.	2001-03-26

Penny Gardner has done us the favor of distilling important quotes while weaving them into her analysis and application of the Mason method into the subject areas that all homeschooling parents worry about. My big problem with this book, as with others dealing with the same subject, is that it leaves the homeschooling parent hanging into how to compile an adequate portfolio for our students in states that require such reporting. It also does not adequately explain how the Charlotte Mason approach to education can be applicable in the all important high school years.

This short book is a wonderful introduction to the application of the Charlotte Mason approach to homeschooling. But I would recommend reading Karen Andreola's book first. What Andreola's book lacks, you can find in Levinson's little book. It tells you what to do...it gives you more cocnrete ideas. There are problems with the book. SOmetimes the author mentions someone as if the reader is supposed to know who the person is. I foudn myself going to her bibliography to identify names. This was distracting. Also, the book does not really explain how the author implements the method. The method is described but I would have liked reading more about how she has done it. Andreaola covers that much better.

Recently, too many accusations have been hurled at this saintly man. These accusations are a thin veil for the anti-Catholic strain in our society. It is with a lawyer's eye that the author examines the role of Pius XII dealing with the subject of the Jews and the Nazi criminals. To take a public stand or not is not a signal of bravery. After all, the Bible clearly states that one should not let one hand know what the other hand does. Perhaps, Pius XII's detractors need to be reminded that great acts of courage are done quietly. This is a most recommended book.	2000-12-01

This year my daughter is doing Greece. We started on mythology and dumped a lot of books. Then we discovered this one. What a little treasure this turned out to be!!  Each god is described clearly ,in an entertaining fashion. Every story was read and remembered with ease by her not yet 10 year old mind. Frankly, it should be in the library of every household....It can be read by all ages because it is entertaining and painless....	2000-12-01

A new theory about the murder of the York princes accompanies a very interesting and sympathetic portrait of Richard III. read it slowly. Savor its length.	2000-09-24

This is a wonderful general introduction tot he study of ancient Egypt.  Caution: This is really meant for grades 7 and up. The langauge is  difficult for younger ones,even as a read-aloud.
