She touched on some real issues, that some are truly afraid to venture to.  Every character and their situation were so very real to me.<br /><br />Mercedes (the main character, who had issues to work through), Miss Betty (the mother that we can all relate to), Redman (the maintenance man in your life) and of course Mr. Darius (Mr. Right if you'll allow him to be).<br /><br />Electa pulls you in from page one, and the two explosive scenes with the women (Mercedes & her best friend) fighting back were hilarious!!<br /><br />Always remember that holding on to past hurt will only hinder who you are as a person.  What's done in the dark will come to light!  Always tell your children what they mean to you and show it before its too late!!  And finally, Almost Doesn't Count!!<br /><br />Keep up the good work Electa!! - Your #1 fan forever!!	2005-08-09

This book pulled me in from the beginning and didn't let go.  My son actually hid it from me because he said I wouldn't put it down to go to sleep.  I loved all the characters, Daisy, Jay, Adonis, Gigi and Ming Li.  Many of the other characters were a trip.  You'll love this book, it's characters and definitely the story line.  The line from this book that stuck out to me was when you said \\"That a person has to suffer to grow\\" that is such a true statement.  We all have to live in order to learn things.  Like isn't an easy street and I believe you showed that in this book.  Ms. Dames, keep up the good work, may God continue to bless you and I look forward to your next literary baby!!  Go Get This Book!!!	2005-06-22

The Criss Cross reads like an edge of your seat movie.<br /><br />The author, pulls you from the prologue and keeps you until the last discussion question!!<br /><br />The characters - The Ling Sisters, Noki - She was TOO MANY THINGS!!  Nikki - She was a very relatable characher, altough you may not like a lot of what she did, you could understand her struggle.  Kapri/Kapone - dealt a hard deck of cards, made a lot of the wrong choices.  Ivanka - OFF THE CHAIN, purple lipstick anyone??

I purchased the book when it was first released but still had a couple of books to finish first.  Bad mistake on my part.

And oooh please don't let me forget that Aaron (the daughter you love to hate).  This story is real, keeps you guessing and most importantly you can relate to it.  It shows you how your past can come back to hurt you when you least expect it.  And that you should be as honest as possible.  We are all human and can't control the unexpected.  It also teaches you when life throws you a lemon, you definitely have to make lemonade!!<br />Run out and get this book.  Buy it as a gift!!  Spread the Word.

Each character is so unique.  In reading this book I thought I was going to smack Tiara right off the pages, but the books tells a story that you can both relate to and learn from.  Tiara was definitely using what you had to get what she wanted, but is she wanted worth it????  To answer that question, pick up the book.  You won't be disappoint!!  And old saying is everything that glitters ain't gold.  And everything that looks good to you ain't good for you.  Just ask Tiara Bynum!!  Karen Miller keep doing your thing.

Got A Man is her second literary baby and she just gets better with time.  I finished this book in less than 2 days.  It grabs you in from the beginning and you just don't want to put it away.  Her characters Shonda, Malik, Kim are so real, you feel like you know them personally.  Shonda and Kim are so alike but yet so different and Malik is just the man in the middle.  The problems and situations they go thru are so everyday, if you can't relate (you are in DENIAL!, and De Nile is a river in Egypt!)  Malik is a guy we all know or have known at one point in our lives, whether he is our brother, an uncle or an old friend who we've lost touch with.  Run out and get this book, you won't be disappointed.  And if you haven't read Yo Yo Love, go out and get that too!!  Keep up the great work Daaimah!  Your a Star!!	2003-07-04

The story, what can I say so real, told in a way that kept you wanting more.  The characters, Juanita ( a young woman finding out who she is), Conan ( a guy trying to go somewhere but can't rid himself of the past), Scooter (a very naive individual but a true friend), Aunt Hattie & Uncle Herbie( two loving people who did what they had to do in order to survive), Jorge (an underhanded sneaky conartist, when friends like him who needs enemies).  This is a page turner!  The book is about love, friendship, trust, deceitfulness, color and most importantly learning lessons.  There is one sentence from this book that I will carry with me, \\"Learnin' to leave the past in the past, and instead look at people for who and what they might be today.\\"	2003-02-24

I actually started reading this book on the way to Mr. Major's booksigning and couldn't wait to finish it.  He said to me at the signing that he thought the best part of this book was the revelation of what had happened between John Sebastian and Josephine (Flowers) Prescott, some 7-8 years prior.  I must give him credit cause the book kept you wanting for more.  The characters are so real, you can relate to them.  You feel their pain, everyday struggles in the workplace and most definitely the love flowing from the pages.  The John, Josie and Darren story was wonderfully told.  The friendship between Glo and Jo, Jules and John outstanding.  Nakira, out of the mouth of babes, what can I say!!  Mr. Duke, a loveable character from beginning to end.  Even bringing Ibn back for a minute, too cute.  If you've never picked up a Marcus Major book before you are definitely missing out. Marcus Major has done it again!!

This book grabbed you from beginning to end.  It was definitely worth the wait.  The characters were so real you could relate to them.

It keeps you wanting more.  It's a definite page turner.  You have to read &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; first though to understand everything.  The characters are real, you can relate to them.  Mia, Christian, Brice and Kree.  There should be more Christian's in the world.  Don't underestimate Kree she's a smart cookie.  Mia is Mia, that's all I can say about her.

This book shows what life is really like, the characters were real.  Babysitter was definitely a Cold blooded, scandalous little heifer, but that's why  they say keep your friends close, but your enemies closer!	2000-07-31

Sometimes in life we worry so much about impressioning our mate that we don't focus on what's real.  You showed us all the ugliness that can occur  from one lie!  Can't wait for your next release.	2000-07-17

I knew after reading Fed Up with the Fanny, with my Book Club members, that he would impress me with this one.  The character Monica had me in tears, as a single mother, I  just couldn't believe she would go there.  I look forward to reading more  by Mr. White!  Keep up the Great Work!	2000-03-13
