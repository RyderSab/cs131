This is the most comprehensive source I have found.  While he discussed in-depth the complexities of NF, it's very understandable.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a practioner but it might get a bit too involved to recommend to clients.	2005-04-09

It comes with a nifty board to do the readings with and it provides information on 20-some different stones that can be used for the readings.  I've really enjoyed it even though I think it's slighly 'fluffy'.  I have been using gemstones/crystals in reiki healings for years and also read tarot.  I think that anyone interested in divination with gemstones could take some good ideas from this book!	2005-03-12

It seems a bit quirkier and at times funnier than some of her other books.  Reminded me a lot of Cat's Eye, which has to be one of my favorites by her.

It is one of the few books that I have found that pulls together the chakras and stones so succinctly.  <br />It's set up in chapters, each devoted to one of the chakras, and in each chapter it briefly describes the many aspects of the chakra, covering everything from the mandala that is associated with it, to the colors, crystals and chants.  <br />I definately think that it is of value to any esoteric's book collection.	2004-04-30

She takes you deep in the mind of a woman who has returned to the island of her childhood.  The woman has returned because her father has gone missing from the little house on the island.  But this event is a mere footnote in the book, the real meat of the story is all very much about memories and the inner transformations of the main character.  As always, Atwood's words explode into vivid and lingering images in the reader's mind.  The changes that occur in the character and her actions on the island are so charged with emotion and so complicated, and I found myself thinking about the book for days after I finished dispite the fact that I was initially a bit baffled and even disappointed.	2004-02-27

This book is slow and subtle, and while I wouldn't say it was great, it does have an appeal.  I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters, but Atwood is so good at developing a level of depth to her characters that you become attached to them whether there's much of a plot or not.  While it's not one of my favorites by this author, the book has her style, with vivid, delicious use of words to conjure up beautiful, lurid images in your mind while you read.	2004-02-27

It's got mysticism and cults, action, violence, romance, discussion on religion and science and pretty much all the things you need for a quick, addictive little book that will obsess your mind.  I got a little irritated by the fact that the main character has repeated moments of clarity where SUDDENLY it all makes sense and a section of plot is explained through his revelations, but then again, the plot is pretty contrived to begin with.  I found I enjoyed it none-the-less.	2003-12-22

It was easy to read and also easy to get lost in the lives of it's characters.  After I read it, I thought about it enough to go look at a book of Vermeer's work.  I strongly suggest that anyone reading this have a collection of his work handy because of the references to specific works throughout the book.  That Vermeer's paintings serve as another dimension to the work make it all the more pleasing.	2003-09-30

One is a gay man in for 'corruption of youth' and the other is a political activist.

About midway through, the author begins to place pages-long footnotes on various subjects and these perplexed me a bit.

Jouvet postulates that the function of REM sleep is to periodically reinforce genetic programs, in order to maintain the functional synaptic circuits responsible for our psychological heredity.  Basically, he is saying this \\"genetic reprogramming\\" would restore our individuality and diversity within our species, despite a changing environment.  The hypothesis presented is rarely acknowledged in current literature on the subject and Jouvet has little to support his hypthesis.  <br />I was left with many more questions than I started with, but that could be good. The translation is mediocre but Jouvet throws in some kind of houty chuckles every once in a while that make it bearable.  <br />If you want to read a very comprehensive, readable and informative book on sleep, I would recommend 'Sleep' by J.Allan Hobson.	2003-06-19

While I tend to lean more toward physiological neuroscience perspectives on the functions of our dreams, I am very open-minded and believe that our dreams surely serve a psychological purpose as well.  I picked up this book expecting something more than I got.  I was presented with a poorly written and gender biased first chapter(for example, when talking of one of Cayce's clients &quot;She turned to the woman's world of family and relationships...&quot; Granted it was written several decades ago, but still...)  Honestly, I'm avoiding finishing the book.  I am sure Cayce himself was a very talented dream interpreter and helped many people but Harmon Bro does not do him justice here.	2003-06-19
