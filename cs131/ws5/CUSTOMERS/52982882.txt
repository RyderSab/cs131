NYPD,FBI,CIA,TERRORISTS - WOW	In my wildest nightmares I couldn't have come up with a story line like this one. After the first 50 to 75 pages you are hooked.  It's hard to see where this story will take you.  The twists and turns are as wild as the  ride to the ranch.  The patter between the sexes was corny, but believable.   This will be an HBO movie or a made-for-TV miniseries, bet on it. Not  great literature, but an exciting read.	2000-04-08

I cannot say I did not enjoy reading this book.  Anyone who grew up in the age of the Kennedy power has to be at least remotely interested in these three women's stories.  Being privy to private conversations between them  and feeling you are a part of what happened is also very seductive, however  I just cannot believe that this book is accurate and factual.  Private  conversations were written about between people who would have absolutely  no reason to discuss these conversation with an outside person.  Although  the topic was fascinating, I would say that your best bet would be to view  this book as a Truman Capote genre book, a fiction based on some facts.   You might enjoy it, but I wouldn't use it as historical reference material.	2000-02-23

The story about the streets of Philadelphia  and all of the city's inhabitants gives a real cross section of what life  is like, from the law abiding to the law breaking.  The characters are well  written and the plot flows well.  I'm sure this author's talents will grow  and I look forward to reading future books.

It catches your attention in the beginning, even though I question the accuracy of some of the legal and prison settings and situations.  However,  this agonizing battle that Maggie goes through becomes boring and overdone.   Her friendship, though the author would like us to believe that it ran  deep, did not cover the concept that she actually trusted the person she  supposedly loved, even though she kept reassuring us that she did trust.   There are wonderful moments in the book, but frankly it ended rather flat.   It could have been much better.	2000-01-25

If the author had not dropped the ending into a depressing mess, I would have rated it higher.  This story is well written and the subject is  interesting, but I'm afraid that I was really geared for a happy ending.   This is not the book to read on a dreary winter day if you are already  depressed and need your spirits uplifted.  It's also not a quick read  mostly because the beauty of the writing and scope of the story requires  some thought.  I liked the book up until the last two chapters.  I just did  not like the ending because it seemed that Emma lost everything she had  worked for.  A very sad book.	2000-01-20

The rest of her husband is in the deep freeze and fortunately,  Tupperware holds its contents tightly.  This is not Mr. Smith goes to  Washington - it's Lucille goes to Hollywood.  The other story is what  happens to Wiley and his brother Peejoe while they stay with their  undertaker uncle and Grandma watches Lucille's six children.  What a story!

Some people disagree vehemently, but I appreciate all the stories within the story and Mr.  Michener's great attention to the details.  He starts with the land itself  and takes the reader through the present day by creating a cast of  characters that weave into the next, perhaps like the baskets the Indians  made.

This book takes you from the very beginning of the territory of Alaska to the present time.  I was very interested in the Russians who  settled in Alaska and the environmental issues that were raised even then.   This is a long book, typically Michener, but it is divided into sections  that allow you to start and stop (if you are able) at your convenience.  I  like Michener's works because I always learn something, as well as enjoying  a wonderful story.  You won't be disappointed.	1999-12-12

There is no great message in this  book, other than that peoples' lives are not always what we perceive them  to be.  I really loved this book and am sharing it with my mother.

I have not read Mr. Connelly's other books, but I certainly found this one entertaining.  The twists and turns keep the  interesting going and it's also refreshing to have a parellel drawn between  bad and &quot;not so bad&quot; which is the main character - Cassie.   Cassie loves not wisely and can't resist her basic urges to get rich quick,  but she is also a person with heart and cares about friends, and especially  her daughter.

In fact I read two other books while I was reading this one, so I can't say that it kept my interest from the beginning.  I couldn't quite understand a P.I. taking  this much time and effort to work on a case she wouldn't be paid for.  I  also didn't quite buy the risks she took to solve the case.  I must say  that her portrayal of prison life was unnervingly accurate and I wish that  more writers would tackle the subject of incarceration and the inhuman  treatment of prisoners right here in the good ol' USA.  Georgia is a prime  example of the &quot;company store&quot;, except that prisoners in Georgia  are not even paid for their work.  The powers that be don't even try to  pass it off as rehabilitation.  After all, how much demand is there on the  street for people who can make three tier bunkbeds out of scrap iron.  The  ending was worth wading through the first half of the book, and I would  recommend this book to readers that like mystery and crime stories.  All I  can say is - stick with it.  The ending is worth it.  Perhaps if I had read  this author before I would have understood some of the beginning characters  more.  Give it a try.	1999-10-16
