Following an awful marriage, and an even worst divorce, Della makes an ardent beeline to Victoria's Secret with the one thing in mind that can soothe her aching heart.... Lingerie... silky-smooth-against-the-skin-make-you-forget-all-your-troubles-lingerie.<br /><br />Her therapy sessions which include no shopping OR men have been triumphant...But she wants to reward herself... She can treat herself just this once right? When she finds the ideal sleek black gown, she's so emerged in it; she doesn't seem to notice the sexy airline pilot admiring her from afar. Maybe this indulgence was worth it after all...<br /><br />Each of the stories made it a point to refer to the poor shopping habits of each of the central characters, but there wasn't enough of actually staying true to the theme, which is why I gave the book 3 stars.	2005-10-04

One, I couldn't wait to get my hands on SOMETHING that featured my favorite chick-lit author Sophie Kinsella, and two, it gave me a chance to get acquainted with some more of chick-lit's greatest writers.<br />On a whole, GIRL'S NIGHT IN was an average read. Suffice it to say, the first story, \\"Party Planner\\" written by Meg Cabot had to be my favorite. It was a great introduction, and really had me psyched for what followed. But it seemed from there, many of the stories became deficient in edge and character.<br />There were of course the authors we all know and love that didn't disappoint, such as Sophie Kinsella, Lynda Curnyn and Marien Keyes. I loved the fact that I got introduced to some authors whose works I will be looking out for, like Meg Cabot, Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, Sarah Mlynowski and definitely Adele Lang, who had me in stitches with \\"Don't You Know Who I Am?\\"<br />Overall I think that there will be something in here for everyone to enjoy.

I had to see what the hype was about.  Pamela a.k.a Carmen's story was a fascinating one, despite the many typos and grammatical errors. It's not everyday you hear of women reigning in such positions.<br /><br />She builds a solid name in the streets and vows to herself and her son that she will only be involved in this life up until she is established enough, monetarily, to go back to school, and make a better life for child. But of course the money gets so good, that tearing herself away is an idea that isn't as appealing as it was before.

I don't think that there are many writers that can perfect such realistic situations and intrinsic characters. In my opinion, such a talent is key to writing a great novel.<br /><br />I was most impressed by the fact that as mediocre as I thought this book was, there was something that managed to break through and keep a strong hold my attention.<br /><br />Three friends as different as night and day share the same goal of finding someone special to fall in love and spend the rest of their days with.

Stephanie Glassman is a single mom/spirited jazz singer who aspires to make it big one day. But until then, she is spending the Christmas holiday playing piano and signing Christmas carols in a department store.<br /><br />During one of her shifts, she gets spotted by Frank -- the sexy actor who she had a schoolgirl crush on, and had the pleasure of working with a few years before -- and his perfect fianc&eacute;. Discomfited by her current position (and uniform) she sulks home considering the situation to quite possibly be the worst she has ever encountered.

From that point, she embarks on a little bit of soul searching.<br /><br />Unlike other chick lit novels, BOMBSHELL has much more than gusto and a happy ending. In this novel, our heroine has realistic insecurities and real life issues. Struggling with the emptiness she feels from losing the biological mother she's never known, her psychologist swears that every negative issue or concern that comes her way has something to do with this unfortunate event.<br /><br />On top of it all, she watches as the only man who she's ever really had any true feeling for, marry a woman for the same exact reason he broke it off with her. Grace begins to slowly but surely take life with a grain of salt. Grasping the realism that it is quite alright to be a buxom, bodacious blonde, who doesn't have the perfect body, life, or outlook on dealing with the male species, Grace is the perfect example of the caterpillar turning into the beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />But of course, there is always the prince charming that comes along and steals our protagonist's heart away. This is where Dr. Jonathan Sommerfield comes in. Her relationship with the good doctor is one that is best left with minimal details, as it is a relationship that the author has put together so adequately. The way the two evolved into such growing individuals just by being with each other was so sweet!<br /><br />I didn't read ENGAGING MEN prior to reading BOMBSHELL, but not having the background on the characters prior, the way I see most of the other reviewers did,  was definitely NOT a problem. I enjoyed this book all the same, and feel that it is completely worthy of 5 stars!	2004-12-24

In THE SHAUGHNESSEY ACCORD, we meet Tripp Shaughnessey, the quirky jokester of SG-5.<br /><br />Tripp is positioned in Manhattan, on a 24 hour watch of the supposed efforts of a diamond merchant's unlawful commerce with none other than the enemy Spectra IT. His stakeout spot -- the corner sandwich shop that the SG-5 men frequent for lunch. The owner of the shop, Glory Brighton, has had Tripp's attention for awhile, and he doesn't understand what it is about her that makes him weak in the knees. From his station he has complete surveillance of the ins and outs of the shop, hoping to nail the crooks as they attempt to do their dirty work.<br /><br />The minute he decides to take a break, and works up the nerve to go and see Glory, disaster strikes. Good guy, right place, wrong time.  While he flirts and gets to know her in ways that make the both of them hotter than a tea kettle, the criminals that he is supposed to be keeping a watchful eye on, sneak their way in through the front and hold all the customers and employees hostage.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the criminals for the latter part of their malevolence, Tripp manages to keep Glory and himself secure for some time and send out a code to the men of SG-5. But their refuge is quickly stripped away when, Danh Vuong, the chief of the crime committing thugs, discovers them and binds them up, making sure that their plans flow accordingly.<br /><br />Through this ordeal, Tripp and Glory get to know each other better, thus resulting in an action packed love story.<br /><br />Though I feel Tripp and Glory's love story wasn't fleshed out as much as I would have liked it to be. I still enjoyed the book, and am anxiously awaiting my third installment to come in - The Samms Agenda. This series just keeps getting better and better.	2004-12-14

I wanted more, but I was satisfied in knowing that there may be a part 2 in this fascinating love story.<br /><br />Billie Burke is the beauty editor for Du Jour!, the trendiest and hottest magazine out there. To her, its all about getting her work done and spending quality time with her two very best friends. She hasn't had a boyfriend since college and has gotten used to things being that way ... that is until a hurricane by the name of Jay Lane enters her world and sweeps her off of her feet.<br /><br />Jay Lane, the hard-hitting Brooklyn thug turned actor/successful writer exudes all things sexy, jagged, responsive and amorous.  Billie has never felt this way before ... this love thing feels really good. So good in fact that she finds herself slipping at work and dedicating all her time, her energy and most of all herself into her relationship with Jay. What they have is so real. The kind of love where it literally hurts to be separated from each other for more than 2 seconds. The kind of love where you feel if you hold on tight enough the two of you will literally become one. We can't help but to love and support Jay when a certain someone (who he has been lying about and keeping secret from Billie) from his tumultuous past threatens to put an end to the sweetest thing the pair has ever known.<br /><br />Never before in chick lit have I read about such a bona fide super fly relationship. Tia Williams has really done it with this one. Pick this book up, its worth it.	2004-11-30

Never before had I read a novel by Alison Kent, or books about covert-ops and mission impossible scenarios. But, when it comes to reading, I am willing to try anything at least once. THE BANE AFFAIR was so good that there is no way on God's green earth that I will be passing on the next four episodes that follow.<br /><br />The Smithson Group -- better known as SG-5 -- consists of 5 spies specially selected by Hank Smithson. Christian Bane is the first of these men. He is sent out to pose as Peter Deacon, the shady boss of SG-5's archenemy Spectra, who has a weakness for expensive clothes, fast cars and even faster women. Christian, who is the complete opposite of Deacon, must step outside of himself in order to get the information he needs about a deal made between a genius scientist and Spectra, concerning a governmental encryption technology.<br /><br />To Christian, this case will be an easy one to crack. That is until he meets Natasha Gaudet, the beautiful and sexy personal assistant and goddaughter of the scientist. From when they first meet, Natasha and Christian develop an indescribable love connection. How is he supposed to work like this? Especially when he has no clue as to whether or not Natasha is in on the deal with Spectra. This distraction is way more than he bargained for. It is one that helps quiet the demons of his past, and assures him that he can trust and love again.	2004-11-27

It was the perfect example of African American chick-lit. Filled with comedy, romance, and great friends, it was a novel I truly enjoyed. So when I discovered that Ms. Poole released a sophomore project, I just knew I was going to enjoy it as much as I did her first. That's what I get for jumping the gun. `GOT A MAN' was not only lukewarm, but the editing was bad, and it was extremely repetitious throughout. Whatever happened to keeping the reader on their toes?<br /><br />Meet Shonda & Kim. Two women in love with the same man. Kim has been in a steady relationship with her fianc&eacute; Malik for about 4 years, but that relationship is tested when Shonda temps as a receptionist at Malik's law firm. The two begin to hit it off, and Malik strays away from Kim, pursuing a relationship with Shonda, even though he and Kim have a baby on the way. From then it becomes a back and forth thing. Malik strings the two women along, but the two women insist on berating each other instead of putting the cheating loser in his place.<br /><br />There was a whole lot of \\"Pick me\\", \\"you don't know what a mistake you are making\\", \\"that is my man\\", and yadda yadda yadda. Same story different title.<br /><br />It was very predicatable, and poorly written. A big disappointment in my opinion.	2004-11-19

But even still, she knows deep down that he doesn't want to get married. So she gives him an ultimatum - unless he can commit to her as a husband and not just a boyfriend, then there is no chance in them getting back together. Duffy thinks he can handle it - maybe even change Mel's mind and convince her that things are fine the way that they are. Time moves forward, and Mel is the first one to start seeing someone else - this has Duffy sick. He obsesses over this situation and slowly but surely he begins to realize how in love with Mel he is... But is it too late? Has Mel already closed her heart towards him? You'll have to read to find out. I will tell you that I was a bit surprised at the end. Gayle really had me going.<br /><br />This is a definite must read. A cute and hilarious story that also tugs at your heart.	2004-11-12

Here she is thinking that things will fall right back into place when the pair of them get back home to their friends and family... Little did she know, her last name wasn't the only thing that changed.<br /><br />When her best friend Suze befriends another \\"best friend\\" Becky feels left out and distances herself away from her. She later on comes to find out from her parents  - who have been acting EXTREMELY weird since she's been back - that she has a long lost sister. This is great! Now that Suze has moved on with her life, and found a new friend she has a SISTER to replace her... and this time it will be extra special because they are family and they will have that \\"special bond\\" that sisters have... She couldn't be more wrong. Becky's sister is THE complete opposite. She is frugal, plain, and HATES to shop! Becky is sure that this cant be possible. She tries any and everything to get along with her sister, but any and everything just isn't good enough. They simply cannot get along, and as time goes on they begin to despise each other... But the reason they cant get along maybe the fact that they are more alike than they think.<br /><br />This was such a good book. Becky hasn't changed one bit. She is the same wacky shopaholic we know and love.<br /><br /> The ending was great... Complete with a surprise and room left for a Shopaholic Pt 5.	2004-11-12

I remember as a young girl growing up, my mother used to read Jackie Collins' books. I used to sneak them to my room and try to read them, but I would never get past the 1st chapter because she would always catch me and snatch it away, saying I wasn't \\"old enough\\" to read books like this... Boy was mom right! At age 10 I would NEVER be able to appreciate \\"books like this\\".<br />CHANCES by Jackie Collins is one word -UNPARALLED. Never before have I read a novel so gripping and full of emotion... it is to the point where someone tomorrow can ask me \\"what is your favorite book?\\"... and instead of my answer being \\"too many to name\\"... I will respond \\"Chances\\".<br /><br />Meet Gino Santangelo - mob boss, father, business man, player, friend...he is all of these things and more. Gino had a very tough life growing up. His mother left him and his father when he was just a young boy and his father lashed out by turning into an abusive monster. He went from home to home, where he toughened up, got smart and vowed to never be like his dad. Collins' takes us through his entire life, never missing a beat. We watch him grow, and become one of the most successful casino and hotel owners. But then an unfortunate event takes place banning Gino from America. Who will take his place? In comes Lucky his stunning daughter, who is a carbon-copy of her father in every way imaginable. She is determined to be bigger and better then her old man.<br /><br />In this book we are also introduced to Carrie, a woman who was forced into prostitution at the tender age of 12, paving the way for the unfortunate circumstances she had to suffer through.<br />Both Carrie and Gino's stories ones to always remember. Compelling, and out of this world, CHANCES is really a 10 star book. I will definitely be picking up the 2nd book in the Santangelo saga.<br /><br />Bravo Ms. Collins!!	2004-10-23

I found it very hard to keep up with all the characters, mainly because there was just so much going on.<br />I didn't find it to be a mystery nor quite a romance either. At one point it became very repetitious and extremely drawn out.<br /><br />When Nell Dysart and her husband of 22 years get a divorce she finds herself weighed down by depression. She decides to accept a position as a secretary for a bedraggled detective agency. Nell sees some promise in this little business, envisioning changing it into an office of perfection.<br />Her boss, Gabe McKenna has just been dumped by his ex-wife for the second time, and is in constant argument with his cousin/partner, Riley, about the same tired cases. Nell steps in and puts his life in order, claiming herself as an efficient, sharp and intelligent woman... thus in the beginning they develop a love/hate relationship.<br /><br />A murder case brings them closer together, also tying all the characters in as well. The mystery of the book did not leave me in suspense, and the romance aspect of it did nothing for me. There was more talk about a stolen dashund puppy named SugarPie/Marlene, and some ancient family china.<br /><br />Overall I give this book 3 stars for the effort put forth.	2004-10-13

I am a SUCKER for romance so NIGHTS IN RODANTHE was just my cup of tea. Break out the economy size box of Kleenex because this one's a tear-jerker. The last time I cried over a love story the way I did with this one was about 6 or 7 years ago when \\"Titanic\\" came out.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is a great writer. The progression of love between Adrienne and Paul was so overwhelming; I had butterflies in my stomach. I sat on the train on my way to work just smiling as I read. I felt like I was a part of the story, literally feeling every iota of emotion expressed upon the pages.<br /><br />Yes it is sappy and syrupy sweet, but aren't those the key ingredients for the perfect romance novel? Aren't you supposed to feel like (if you're not already) falling in love?<br /><br />The end was so poignant, and I still can't get over it. NIGHTS IN RODANTHE will touch your heart and warm your soul. This is a story that I will ALWAYS remember.	2004-09-30

Tracey Davenport, single mother to Lauren gets involved with Aaron -- Lauren's 20-something boyfriend.<br /><br />At 17, Lauren is a good kid and follows all rules, despite her mother's `do as I say, not as I do' attitude. She is contemplating taking the next step with Aaron, by giving herself completely to him. Even though they only have been going out for a little more than a few months, she truly loves him, and he is the first real boyfriend she's had. Her mother feels as though she should wait, as she doesn't want her only daughter to get pregnant at such a young age the way she did.<br /><br />Tracey's relationship rap sheet isn't a good one. Every guy she's been involved with has dropped her like a hot potato. But with Steven, she felt that this time, she'd struck gold. No man has ever made her feel so loved before, and she thinks that he is definitely \\"the one\\". Unfortunately, that relationship suffers the same fate as the ones before, leaving Tracey feeling dejected, unwanted and unloved.<br />In Aaron she finds something different. Though he is young in age, his actions speak volumes, and his attentiveness soothes her broken heart. She finds this young man to be more understanding, sensitive and extremely mature. Before we know it, Aaron and Tracey are caught in a whirlwind of emotions, secretly meeting and being together behind Lauren's back.<br /><br />I could not stand Tracey. She was selfish, needy and above all CRAZY!!!! What kind of mother would do the things she did to her child? She disgusted me, and even though she started to find herself in the end, I couldn't get past the resentment I had towards her as the reader.<br /><br />Although I found this book to be very real and poetically written, there were parts of the story that were left to hang in the balance. Like what ever happened to Tracey's best friend Indira? Why wasn't the fall of Tracey's relationship with her own mother ever discussed further? Why didn't we get Tracey's view on how her relationship with Lauren was progressing after the Mother-Daughter retreat they attended? Also, I was hoping that Derrick (Lauren's biological father) would sweep Tracey off her feet and they would end up getting together. He was so sweet, and I was rooting for him the whole time.<br /><br />Overall I give it 3 ½ stars. Not bad for a debut novel that verbalizes an unfortunately realistic subject.nce.

I agree with the many reviewers who loved it, and also with those who simply did not.<br />THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (indeed a VERY creative title) was I guess, just OK. I will admit that from the first page I was disappointed so I put it down, and it sat on my desk collecting dust - that was July 2003. I looked at it two days ago and decided I was going to just go through with it and read it.<br /><br />*sigh* where do I start? Honestly, the front flap of the book pretty much sums it up. \\"Andrea Sachs is a small town girl fresh out of college, who lands the job \\"a million girls would die for\\". Along with this so called \\"dream job\\" is the boss from hell - Miranda Priestly. Andrea is in for a rude awakening. Her ultimate goal is to become a writer for The New Yorker, and she feels that working for the high-profile, almighty and omnipotent Miranda will get her there.<br /><br />An-dre-ah (as Miranda calls her) endures almost a year's worth of abuse from this woman. All she did was complain, complain, complain. It got annoying after awhile, because she never really DID anything about it, so there was definitely a lack of sympathy. Being Miranda's personal assistant took over her entire life, and she started to slowly, but surely abandon her family, best friend, and boyfriend. Didn't she know that this job wouldn't land her career as a writer for The New Yorker???<br />What's funny is that I can totally relate to Andrea. I interned for a high-profile celebrity's Production company (which shall remain nameless) while in college and also had the boss from hell - but I did something about it, so it irritated me that the author made Andrea such an infuriating character.<br /><br />The only positives about this book -- the fact that the storyline was consistent and SOME parts of it made me laugh. Other than that, I didn't enjoy the ending, and I didn't like the fact that Miranda's character wasn't extended a bit more. There had to be more to her then the fact that she was a witch. The readers did get a taste of her acting somewhat like a human being... and I thought we were getting somewhere -- but then unfortunately that was quickly taken away. My rating? 2 ½ stars.<br /><br />I heard this was supposed to be made into a movie, maybe that will resuscitate this mediocre attempt of what it's really like to work for the rich and glamorous..

This was my first time reading a Jane Green novel and I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. BABYVILLE by Jane Green was an awesome story about babies and \\"thirty-something parenthood\\".<br />The story focuses on three characters. Julia, Maeve, and Sam are as different as night and day.<br />Julia, married to her loving husband Chris is feeling unfullfilled in her marriage after she gives birth to their son George. Maeve is a single woman living the good life, satisfied with her career, and sees no relationship or kids in her near future. Julia has been with her live-in boyfriend Mark for six years, but they are by no means \\"in love\\", but simply \\"in like\\". The two feel that if they have a baby, that will change the direction their relationship is going... to bad they are having problems with conceiving and that brings even more strain into their already dwindling relationship.<br /><br />The book is broken down into three parts, each part telling each woman's story. Maeve's \\"I don't want a relationship, and the sight of a stroller makes me break out into a rash\\" attitude is quickly tested with an unexpected pregnancy. Sam thinks that running off with her friend's sexy husband is the answer to her depressing life of being a full-time mother.<br />This is another book where the characters were well thought out, and well brought together in the end. Jane Green has truly taken chick-lit to another level with this and I will definitely be picking up her other books. 5 Stars for BABYVILLE!	2004-09-03

The characters were very well thought out which I thought was great, being that this book had two authors.<br />If this is the way things really go down in the world of the African American elite, than that is a sick place to be. There were so many lies, so much invective behavior it was sickening. All of the money in the world could not get me to associate with people like that.<br />Manny was way passed the need to find himself. I couldn't believe how clingy and depreciated he made himself out to be. Tandy was just an evil and heartless witch with no morale. Ed Thomas was a cheating billionaire loser who I wasn't quite sure I wanted to end up with Lauren, his wife, who loved him as any wife should love her husband.<br />I loved the way these four characters came together in the deceit and betrayal that made up Manhattan's upper crust. Though I was a bit disappointed in the end (the reason I gave this book only 4 stars), I definitly would recommend this book.	2004-08-31

The perfect novel to snuggle up with on a cold winter day in front of a fire.<br />Although I felt the same as many reviewers did about the story line stretching out a little, I thought Kelly and Ashton were so perfect for each other. I felt the chemistry and energy between them. Ms. Perrin made Ashton sound like the perfect guy; sweet, talented, funny and oh so sexy. There were many times where I got a little annoyed at Kelly when she would keep putting up a barrier. I just kept yelling out loud, \\"you know you want him!!!!!\\", LOL! When they finally did get it together it was ELECTRIC.<br />FOOL FOR LOVE is a great read. I totally recommend it.	2004-08-22

I decided that I was going to wait until I go on vacation to read it. I started it the day before I left, and was finished with it 2 days into my vacation, and that was ONLY because my sister kept telling me to put it down, so that I could actually ENJOY my time away....<br /><br />Erica Kennedy has definitely put herself on the map with this debut, and I am giving her the props that she deserves.<br />BLING is the story of Mimi, a small town biracial girl from Ohio. Mimi has dreams of making it big in the music business. She encounters Lamont, head of the big time hip hop label Triple Large Entertainment. Lamont promises Mimi everything she dreams of and MORE. Through her journey we share her triumphs, disappointments, love, and the moment when she discovers who she really is.<br /> The characters were SO real, and for some strange reason I was really rooting for Lamont and Mimi.<br />Words cannot express how GOOD this book is. I TOTALLY recommend it!! There was a lot of name dropping, and I found myself trying to guess if these charaters were based on the celebrities we know and love.<br />Go out and get your copy today!!!	2004-08-21

I just finished reading BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY and I must say I was not that impressed. I picked up this book thinking I was going to laugh my head off but that wasn't the case. I hardly understood what she was talking about most of the time, and I get the feeling that maybe the reason I couldn't relate to the book is because I am still in my early 20's.<br />The book did have some parts that made me laugh out loud but it wasn't very often. I found myself contemplating just putting the book aside, but felt the need to finish it.<br />Bridget's mother annoyed me throughout the whole story. I can't fathom having a mother like that. Her dad was a bit of a softy, I felt that as a man he didn't claim his place, and should've spoke his mind, instead he let Pam Jones (Bridget's mom) walk all over him.<br />Bridget's friends were the highlight of this book for me, they were crazy and comical all at the same time. Overall, I rate this book as AVERAGE. Maybe the movie will bring it to life for me and make up for it.	2004-08-13

I love celebrity gossip, so I try to tune in daily. When I heard that Wendy Williams was coming out with a tell-all autobiography, I was too excited.<br />I obtained my copy the week it came out, and when I finished it (in 2 days) I was sort of a disappointed. It was a bit over-rated, and not as \\"juicy\\" as I was expecting it to be. A lot of the stories she told, I knew about already, and in a way I felt that she was fronting on a lot of information. She talked about her drug habit, her departure from Kiss FM, and her miscarriages, but I still didn't feel that she was being as candid with her own story the way she said she would.<br />I did however enjoy the last two chapters of the book, entitled \\"Advice Hour\\" and \\"Ten Simple Rules\\". In those chapters she provided useful information and wonderful words of wisdom.<br />Overall, the book was just OK to me. I hope her next book makes up for what I felt was missing.	2004-08-08

It was chock full of the 4 D's... drama, deception, discrimination and disaster... That made for a perfect guilty pleasure.<br /><br /> SOULAMTES DISSIPATE is the story of Jada and Wellington, two people in love and and engaged to be married... but for how long? The two are made out to be this perfect couple, but that is soon tested when Melanie, a long-time friend of Wellington's family comes into the picture. Wellington's mother is not fond of Jada, because she doesn't fit into her \\"class of people\\". She thinks Melanie is a MUCH better pick for her son. A lot of double-crossing takes place in the event to break Wellington and Jada up. What made me mad was the fact that Jada fell for the lies.. she was so naive at times. Wellington didn't try hard enough to stand up to his mother, and I think that he secretly wanted to be with Melanie anyway.<br /> This book was delicious. If you're looking for a book that will just take you away for awhile, out of reality... than this is it. You know how sometimes you can read a book, and months later you forget many details of it? Not this one. The story will stick with you. I will definatly be reading the sequel: NEVER AGAIN ONCE MORE.	2004-07-28

It is truly a story that is meant to uplift and remind us women that we are worth so much more than most of us give ourselves credit.<br />\\"Cosmopolitan Girls\\", is pretty much the diaries of Lindsay and Charlie. Two small-town girls living successfully in the Big Apple. Lindsay is a Television Exec who has dreams of becoming a Producer. She is dating an accomplished  video director who she thinks is \\"the one\\". Charlie on the other hand is living with her fiance and his two kids from a previous relationship.<br />A broken heart and unfaithfulness brings these two women together one day at a club.

I had never heard of her before until one day at the bookstore, I  picked up one of her other books. I decided to look it up on Amazon and found out that the one I picked up, was part of the Hannah Swensen series. They seemed pretty interesting.<br />\\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder\\" focuses on Hannah Swensen, the owner of the The Cookie Jar, a quaint cookie shop in the small town of Lake Eden in Minnesota. Hannah finds Ron LaSalle, Lake Eden's football hero dead in his delivery truck with one of her famous Chocolate Chip Crunches still in his hand.<br />From then on, Hannah sets out to find Ron's killer. She questions everyone in town, but has no leads, because everyone she questions has a motive.<br /> We learn about the small town, and and fall in love with the coziness and friendliness of it. Everybody knows everyone, and this can be a good and a bad thing. In Hannah's case, it works to her advantage, because where there is a small town, there are a bunch of nosy and informed people who feed her with loads of clues.<br />There are a lot of characters so you have to keep up.<br />All in all, I thought it was a good mystery, because the person who I thought committed the crime didn't. I was left surprised in the end. The book was also full of yummy cookie recipes, that left my mouth watering everytime I picked up the book. I don't suggest that you read this mystery on an empty stomach.<br />I definatly will be reading the second installment of Ms. Fluke's Hannah Swensen mysteries.	2004-07-09

I am 23 now, and till this day I am still affected by it.<br />In &quot;Beloved&quot; by Toni Morrison we are taken through the life of Sethe, an former slave from Ohio who is being haunted by a destructive spirit. This spirit, who is known as Beloved, makes life difficult for her and the rest of the family. But Sethe finds comfort in the ghost who is the spirit of her dead baby. The baby was never given a name.<br />I found &quot;Beloved&quot; to be a hard read at times, but it was a masterpiece all the same. Toni Morrison, knows how to paint pictures with words. Every detail, every account, and every haunting moment of this story stays with you in a way that is undescribable.<br />As an African American woman, I was vividly taken back in time by this book. What I didn't learn about slavery I felt the agony of it, and what my ancestors went through.<br />&quot;Beloved&quot; is truly a timeless tale.	2004-07-03

There were many times when it stirred all of the hurt, anger, and disgust I had in me, and I had to put it down for a minute to regroup.

This book was all wrong!<br /><br />  I felt that \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" was just a little too cliche. A little too much like \\"True to the Game\\" just with a very bootleg edge to it. Its one thing to hype up a story and make it a little unrealistic, but it's a WHOLE other ball game when it's so far-fetched to the point where you are about to throw the book out of the window.<br /><br /> \\"A Hustler's Wife\\" is about a young girl named Yarni whose boyfriend/fiance Des gets thrown in jail. Yarni goes through many different obstacles in her life while Des is in jail. She keeps in contact with him and promises him her heart forever, all the while messing with other guys and doing her own thing. The story jumped around a little too much for my taste. It made my head spin.  Things started happening to quickly and the plots in some areas got really sloppy.<br /><br />This is a book that you will have to read at your own risk. The only advice I have is that if you are going to read it, make sure you borrow it from a friend or from the library. It's not one for the collection.	2004-05-27

Everything seems to go downhill for her after that point as she runs into comical circumstance after circumstance.<br />I thought that this book was hilarious, but NOT at all as witty as the Shopaholic Series.<br />  The ending of &quot;Can You Keep A Secret&quot; left me a little disappointed because I felt that it was a bit rushed. I also wanted to know more about how Emma's relationship with her parents was progressing. Overall, it wasn't a waste of money and would definatly recommend it for a day at the spa or beach.

The main character Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood is a 25 year old financial journalist who is in debt because of her frivoulous spending habits. The way Becky gets herself into deeper debt and more trouble is what makes this book so funny. I found that I could not put the book down because I just HAD to see how she was going to get herself out of the sticky situations she managed to get herself in. At times I would get annoyed with some things that Becky did, but I just couldn't stay mad at her. She is like a zany best friend. Her thoughts and the way she  plotted things out were so comical, I found myself literally laughing out loud. This book truly kept my interest throughout. The farther you get into the book, the crazier the circumstances and the louder the laughs. I definatly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun and light read.

Francine Rivers has done it and she has done it well. When I was first recommended this book, I was a little aprehensive about reading it, only because I had never read a Christian novel before. All it took was the very first page and I was hooked!!! Francine Rivers writes with such vivid imagination and color. The characters were so real that I felt I knew them personally, I felt I could touch them and talk to them. I read this book about 2-3 years ago and I will never forget the impact that it has had on me.<br />The story focuses on a young Jewish girl named Hadassah who is of Christian belief. She falls in love with Marcus Valerian, the wealthy son of Decimus and Phoebe, and older brother of snobbish and spoiled Julia. (They happen to be her masters; the family that she works for) Hadassah's solemn, humble, and plain way positively affects everyone she meets. She is a true example of the Child of God; strong and admirable.<br />This is truly a masterpiece, and I would recommend this book to ANYONE, no matter what types of books you are into. This story will stay with you for years to come. A story like this should definatly be made into a movie!	2004-02-19
