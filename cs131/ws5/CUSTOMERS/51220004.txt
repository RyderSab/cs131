Although this book was originally recommended when I took a masters-level \\"Literature of Travel\\" course, this unique piece of literature has been calling out to me for quite some time. I'm glad I finally took time out to read it. <br /> <br />On one level, this is a book about the spiritual journey of an American Buddhist as she climbs the metaphorically important mountains of China. On another level, this book painted an important sociological and historical portrait of China in the aftermath of Mao's tyrannical Cultural Revolution/Great Leap Forward. The stories relayed by Xuan Ke, about how the intellectuals were tricked into critiquing the government and subsequently tortured and/or killed is truly the stuff of nightmares. Yet, Xuan Ke understood the importance of honestly understanding the past and he uses his rotten teeth as a symbol for such remembrance. \\"My wife keeps asking me to get my teeth fixed. They are all bad since being in prison. But they are like the Great Wall; the history of my life and therefore the history of the Chinese people shows in them, so they will stay like this\\" The book ends with Xuan Ke wiggling his darkened teeth and saying \\"Remember these.\\" (Ehrlich, 121) <br /> <br />Despite the criticisms in some of the other reviews, I feel that Ms. Ehrlich is an American sincerely trying to understand a totally foreign culture while demonstrating a true empathy for the suffering, both in the past and in the present, experienced by the Chinese people. Her prose is both poetic and informative at the same time and I am looking forward to reading her other work. <br />	2005-06-24

Several months ago I took a class called \\"The Literature of American Slavery\\" and I couldn't believe that slavery existed in America only 140 years ago.  After reading a number of narratives describing the horrors of slavery, I was relieved that those horrors no longer existed.  ...Boy, did this book prove me WRONG! <br /> <br />No - slavery did not end with the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution!  As Mende Nazer has shown, it is very much alive in the Sudan and elsewhere.  Her story about her capture and subsequent enslavement is certainly an eye-opener! <br /> <br />In addition to an extremely powerful anti-slavery statement, this book also teaches us so much on an antrhropological, sociological & historical level! The first section of the book, for instance, is a fascinating account of the traditional lifestyle in the Nuba Mountains.  Included here are descriptions of the close-knit family/community ties,  recreational activities such as inter-village wrestling matches, and finally,rituals such as female circumcision. <br /> <br />Next, it provides reader with a highly readable history lesson.  It teaches us about the political and social turmoil in the Sudan.  It delves into the subjugation of the black Africans by certain Arab communities and reminds us of the genocide inflicted throughout the country.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to open their eyes to the injustices of the world! Thank you, Ms. Nazer, for telling your story! <br />	2005-06-10

While riding the LIRR into NYC, the billboard for the Broadway play \\"Wicked\\" briefly caught my attention.  As I didn't know anything about it, I was doubly interested when I saw the novel sitting on the bookstore shelf a few days later.  My curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the book...I definitely don't regret it. <br /> <br />As I was growing up in the 1970s & 1980s, I clearly remember that watching the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" on TV was an annual event. The Wicked Witch of the West and her flying monkeys were the stuff of nightmares while Glinda the Good Witch and the Wizard himself represented fluff and goodness.   Elphaba, the misunderstood woman who eventually becomes known as the Witch of the West, shows us, however, that things are not always as they seem (something important to remember in today's political climate!).  Places such as Oz, Munchkinland, Quadling Country, etc. become real places where politics, religion and even tornadoes have tremendous impact.  Even symbols such as the cherished ruby/silver slippers and the Yellow Brick Road itself take on new significance.  Now I would really like to see how this translates into a Broadway production. <br /> <br />In addition to seeing the movie many times, I also read the original story and, yes, there are differences...but it just doesn't matter!  Gregory Maguire's interpretation of this classic tale is tremendously creative and I am looking forward to reading \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" and \\"Mirror, Mirror\\".	2004-08-31

Being the first book I have read by this author, first let me say that I think that Anne Tyler is a great writer.  She does a great job of creating believable characters such as stodgy husband Michael, impetuous wife Pauline, runaway daughter Lindsey, etc. - she effectively illustrates how historical circumstances impacted their life journeys. <br /> <br />That being said, I have to admit that although I was intrigued from beginning to end,  I found the story somewhat depressing...nobody seemed happy (well, except maybe Michael later on).  However, it made me appreciate my own family life, which is significantly happier than that of the fictional Anton family.	2004-08-23

As Abigail Adams reminds her husband to \\"Remember the Ladies\\", Cokie Roberts reminds the reader of the same thing as she discusses the birth of the USA as seen through the eyes of the influential women who lived during those years. Although, as a Social Studies teacher, I am familiar with the events leading up to the American Revolution and the ratification of the Constitution, I learned so much about the women who are so often omitted from history textbooks. Not only does it make me wonder about how American History might have been different had Abigail Adams been permitted to serve as a delegate alongside her husband, but I am also left marveling at the economic innovations of Eliza Pinckney as well as the overall economic and political influence of the women of the times (boycott, propaganda, etc.)  <br /> <br />Although there were times that I found the text a bit dry (unlike some other popular history books I've read recently, it did not read like a novel but like straight-forward history), I still learned a great deal and I plan to incorporate some of this information into my teaching curriculum this year!	2004-08-23

When my Environmental Literature professor (a masters level course)recommended this book to me, all I knew was that it was a story about a man who was being taught by a gorilla named Ishmael.  I didn't realize what a profound and important statement it would make about humanity's role in the world.  I didn't expect finishing this amazing piece of literature with a new world outlook that would influence my feelings toward our environmental responsibility. <br /> <br />Daniel Quinn's philosophical masterpiece teaches us that the world was not made for us to rule.  Instead we were created for the world...to be part of the community of life.  Our intelligence and resourcefulness as a species, however, has given us the ability to become a role model for other species that are capable of evolving as we have.  Ishmael's teaching have really inspired me to see how I can help ... as a teacher myself, I hope I can help spread this important message!   <br /> <br />BTW: The following website has a very helpful downloadable Companion Guide for other teachers looking for a way to incorporate this book into their curriculum: [...]  This site also has many other items of interest for Daniel Quinn fans.	2004-08-02

What a wonderful way to learn about this previously unexplored period of popular history! Erik Larson did an amazing job weaving together the history of the 1893 World Fair and the stories of those whose lives revolved around it, foremost of whom are primary architect Daniel H. Burnham and sinister serial killer Dr. H.H. Holmes.       The World Fair itself amazed me in what it contributed to the world. Just imagine what it must have been like when the White City was ablaze with the newly invented incandescent bulb...or the sensation of rising above the earth on a Ferris Wheel in the days before the Wright Brothers first introduced the airplane to the world! I also found it revealing not only that this was the first time something as basic as the zipper was introduced, but also that this was where the belly dance was first introduced, thus shaping America's image of the Middle Eastern world.       The story of Dr. H.H. Holmes was also fascinating, albeit quite sinister. I just can't believe that there haven't been movies made about this horrifying serial killer...perhaps this book will change that!      BTW...As a history teacher myself, I suppose I, like some earlier reviewers, could analyze every aspect of this book, perhaps even pointing out some possible historical inaccuracies...but that would be doing this fantastic book an injustice. If one reads the \\"Notes and Sources\\" at the end of the book, Larson even admits that some of his information is based on sometimes sketchy available historical records. This is especially true in the case of Holmes, who \\"proved as elusive character, owing in large part to the Philadelphia judge's unfortunate decision to bar District Attorney Graham's three dozen witnesses from giving testimony. Several books have been written about Holmes, but none tells quite the same story.\\" (394). Larson, however, did an amazing job of bringing it all together, making a true story read like intriguing fiction! (If he just provided dry facts, itjust wouldn't hold many readers' attention!) I'm looking forward to reading his earlier writing.	2004-07-30

The story begins as Eddie, a carnival-ride maintenance man., is killed while trying to save a little girl from a plummeting carnival ride.    Heaven, he discovers, is a place where we learn to understand our yesterdays from 5 people from our own lives (and not always the people you'd expect!). <br /> <br />While Eddie learns important lessons after his death, we, through the beautiful simplicity of the plot, get to learn along with him while still alive.  We are thus reminded about the interconnectivity of life, sacrifice and love before it's too late.  This is definitely a book I could read again! <br /> <br />	2004-07-28
US	51220004	R1ISCWHNQB7MS4	081297106X	635066654	Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Best book I've read in a LONG time - an award winner!	&quot;I have a recurring fantasy that one more article has been added to the Bill of Rights: the right to free access to imagination. I have come to believe that genuine democracy cannot exist without freedom to imagine and the right to use imaginative works without any restrictions.&quot; (338-339)      Growing up as an American in a family of educators who have always encouraged creativity, I have always taken &quot;free access to imagination&quot; for granted. Although I am fully aware that America has not always practiced what is preached in terms of granting personal liberties, I have always felt confident that my freedoms would be protected by the U.S. Constitution. Reading Dr. Nafisi's thought-provoking memoir has reminded me of the fragility of such freedoms and how ruthless oppression is not just something to be read about in history books.      This brilliant piece of non-fiction appealed to me on so many levels. As an avid reader and a life-long student of literature, for instance, I was intrigued by the way Nafisi intermingled the literature of Nabokov, Fitzgerald, James and Austen into her discussion of her life as a woman and a professor of western lit in the pre-revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran. Not only does she demonstrate how life often imitates art, she also discusses how literature expands one?s perception of reality.      My reality was certainly expanded when I read discussions of such important topics as censorship, fundamentalism, and human rights. It didn't matter that of all the literary works discussed, Gatsby is the only one I've read - the author made me feel totally comfortable with her synopses of the works of Nabokov, James and Austen...and now I would like to thank her for expanding my personal reading list!      Although I have not yet read Nabokov, James or Austen, I couldn?t help drawing on my own reading experiences. As I think about how Iranian women were made &quot;irrelevant&quot; when they were stripped of their statusand forced to wear the veil, I remember &quot;A Handmaid's Tale&quot;, written by Margaret Atwood, a novel in which women are also stripped of their status when they are relegated to the roles of babymakers for the infertile wives of the Commanders in the Republic of Gilead. Like the Iranian women, the handmaids are forced to wear identical shroud-like garments in an attempt to strip women of their individuality. The Republic of Gilead is reminiscent of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as many other totalitarian and fundamentalist regimes in that the strict implementation of revolutionary ideologies led to a dystopian environment where personal happiness is virtually non-existent.       Dr. Nafisi's discussion of censorship, the elimination of the intellectual elite and the overall mentality in Tehran during the Iran-Iraq War, on the other hand, brings me back to the world of Guy Montag in Ray Bradbury?s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. Bradbury created a fictional society where censorship was the rule. Firemen burned books while the media controlled the minds of the populace. Without free access to the written word, intellectual thought and imagination could not develop freely in either Bradbury's fictional world or in the Islamic Republic of Iran.	2004-05-27

Too much!	\\"It's the story of two titans, in their own separate arenas, yet strangely similar in their hubris, who had achieved greatness but suffered tragic faults.  Senator Butler's was a love of power, which had evolved from a means to an end and of itself.  Dr. Lowell's, I'd guess, was a desire for financial recognition and celebrity status appropriate in his mind to his intellect and contribution.  When these two men collided by conspiring to use each other for their own purposes, their tragic fault literally brought them down.\\" (Epilogue, 382)<br />Carol Manning's final character assessment of protagonists Dr. Daniel Lowell and Senator Butler basically says it all.  I guess the central idea here is, as Robin Cook says, \\"the regrettable collision of politics and rapidly advancing bioscience\\" (Author's Note, 386).  ...And honestly, if the plot focused more around the Frankenstein-like theme of the irresponsibility of scientific research and innapropriate political influence in this arena, the story would have been much more effective.  Dr. Cook, however, also felt the need to not only include a sub plot about a mafia-connected investor but also to capitalize on the success of Dan Brown's &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; by including controversial information about the authenticity of the Shroud of Tourin. He even mentions Leonardo Da Vinci at one point! <br />Unethical biotechnology, religious relics, organized crime - there were just too many different things crammed into one story!  It got so ridiculous that, after establishing the plot in the first few chapters, I skimmed through most of the book.  Ironically, the last chapter and the epilogue really gave me all I needed to understand Butler's and Lowell's fate.  The best part of the book was Dr. Cook's &quot;Author's Note&quot;, which provided some very interesting commentary about the unethical relationship between medical reserach and politics.  Other than that, this was book was extremely disappointing.	2004-05-27

The other characters just didn't blend together for me.  Although I saw how Agnes began to accept the religion and customs of the Ojibwe people, I would have liked to see more about their customs.  Overall, I felt a bit bored by much of the story. I definitely liked &quot;The Master Butcher's Singing Club&quot; better.	2004-05-03

My biggest problem with a book like this is not knowing who really wrote it - did Patterson &amp; De Jonge really co-write the book or did  Patterson give De Jonge the idea and did De Jonge in turn write the story.  Oh well -there's no denying the commercial aspect of the publishing business I guess!<br />That being said, this book helped me through some rough times as I began it while was in the hospital being fed intravenous antibiotics for a massive infection. It kept me busy without having to worry about complexity of plot while being interrupted often for blood tests and other things that go on in the hospital. It is a fast-paced, easy read about triumphant vigilante justice...and, of course, they all &quot;live happily ever after&quot; (sort of). Having lived my entire life on Long Island, I especially enjoyed the setting.  Whoever did actually write the book, spent a great deal of time delving into the Long Island experience - from life out on the South Fork (Montauk/ Amagansett), to places such as Ronkonkoma, Manhattan and the Long Island commuter's experience.  Very realistic in that respect.<br />...And I guess public access TV is more than just for stuff like &quot;Wayne's World&quot; :-)!

As a high school social studies teacher, I think some of Jimmy's descriptions would be very motivating for some of my students and I plan to incorporate some of them into my Global Studies lesson plans. <br />In an earlier review, I read that this is more of a man's book since most women wouldn't be interested in fishing or seaplanes. As a woman, I found these sections very interesting. Granted, flying planes and fishing aren't my hobbies, but learning something new is always fun. I don't think gender should influence one's decision to read this book - just keep an open mind!	2004-04-03

Since the Hemingway House is on the &quot;must-see&quot; list for Key West tourists, I thought I should familiarize myself with the work of this renowned author.  &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; particularly caught my eye when I saw that it is the story of Harry Morgan, a man who is forced by economic circumstances and family obligations into smuggling contraband between Key West and Cuba.  I wasn't disappointed!<br />This is an amazing story about a many who does what is necessary for the well-being of his family.  SURVIVAL is a main theme throughout this novel - Harry Morgan does what is necessary for his family's survival; Marie Morgan also learns to survive when she loses her lover and provider.  There is also a vivid contrast made between the &quot;Haves&quot; and &quot;Have Nots&quot; when Hemingway discusses how the wealthy yachtsmen are unable to overcome their petty financial troubles while the struggling and often impoverished Conchs of Key West seem to endure against all odds.<br />Reading this story has whet my appetite for more Hemingway and I am looking forward to spending time with some of his six-toed cats in Key West :-)!	2004-02-04

Ursula Hegi is a truly gifted writer with a magical ability to bring a story to life vividly.  STONES FROM THE RIVER, my first literary encounter with Ms. Hegi's work, was one of my favorite books so naturally I was looking forward to reading THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU, which is a spin-off of the previously mentioned novel.  Stefan Blau was the son of 2 of the villagers in Trudi Montag's hometown in Germany who ran away to America when he was 13 years old - this is the story of his American legacy.<br />The consistent \\"character\\" throughout the century spanned in this novel was not a person but a place...actually a hotel known as the Wasserburg, which Stefan Blau built in New Hampshire in the early-20th century.  The hotel became representative of human growth, opulence and deterioration as it reflected the lives of those who made it their home.  I couldn't help but think of several other literary works in which a place played such a major role in plot development ...Our Town by Thornton Wilder and Standing in the Rainbow by Fannie Flagg, for example.  I also couldn't help compare Emma's attachment to the Wasserburg to that of Scarlet O'Hara's to Tara ...land/property, in both cases, is what endured and remained important as time marched on.<br />I really like the beginning of this book better than the end.  I enjoyed reading about the German-American immigrant experiences of both Stefan Blau and Helene Montag Blau  and I also happily revisited Trudi and Leo when Helene visited with her son Robert (I remember that whole sequence of events in STONES FROM THE RIVER from Trudi's perspective).  I found their 2nd - 4th generation American descendants, however, somewhat depressing to read about.  So many of the main characters were unable to find happiness within themselves and it sort of made me wonder what type of legacy Stefan ended up leaving his progeny after all!  <br />Anyway, I still enjoy Ursula Hegi and am planning to read some of her other works.	2003-07-13

I haven't actually read a play since college and I picked this up because I am going to see the Broadway production of &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot;, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Dennhey,and I always find that I appreciate shows like that more if I am familiar with the play itself.  It was an enjoyable genre change for me!<br />What makes this play particularly interesting is the autobiographical nature of the plot (so disturbingly autobiographical, in fact, that O'Neill would not allow its publication and production until after his death!).  O'Neill dedicated the play to his wife, basically stating that writing this was his way of coming to grips with his own past and the \\"4 haunted Tryrones\\" of his life. I imagine that when this first appeared in the theaters in the 1950s, it struck a sensitive and somewhat controversial chord amongst the public since issues such as drug addiction and alcoholism were not common topics in popular entertainment at the time.  I also enjoyed all the literary references to the likes of Shakespeare, Baudelaire and Swineburne (and so forth!).  It made me want to acquaint myself with such literary talents once again! <br />This is another example of a piece of literature that reaches across the decades with timeless themes such as familial love, loyalty, jealousy, guilt and betrayal, as well as depression, addiction and greed.  While I pitied and even despised some of the qualities I saw in these characters, I couldn't help empathizing with Mary's nervous addiction as well as James' feeling of disappointment in his past failures.  In other words, these characters are all so human, that I couldn't help being drawn into the realistic pathos of their lives.	2003-07-08

Ms. Kingsolver is such a talented writer with an uncanny ability to use well-crafted and entertaining fiction to reveal a fascinating period of history - the political development of the African Congo.

This story was written as a Biblical parable, and includes the Books of &quot;Genesis&quot;,&quot;the Revelation&quot;, &quot;The Judges&quot;, &quot;Bel and the Serpent&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Song of Three Children&quot;.  But this is not the Bible as we know it - &quot;Genesis&quot;, for instance, represents the beginning of the Price Family's African experience. Nathan Price was an evangelical Southern Baptist preacher who leads his wife and 4 daughters to Africa to spread Christianity to the natives in the Belgian Congo in the 1950s.  While his faith blinded him to the cultural differences and political realities that surrounded him, we are told the Price family's story by Orleanna, Rachel, Leah, Adah and little Ruth May Price.  Each segment is told in the first-person and each character has her own voice - what amazed me was how real these women were!  <br />The history of the Congo and Africa as a whole was fascinating and I guess what amazed me most is how the policies of our own government toward other nations in which there are serious economic interests have not changed that much since the 1950s.  Ms. Kingsolver discussed how American interest in the mineral resources (diamonds, copper, cobalt) of the Congo led to  American involvement in the Independence movement there. ...Not unlike the relationship between oil and Middle Eastern entanglements!  Very timely reading!<br />If this book is indicative of all Ms. Kingsolver's writing, I can't wait to read more!	2003-06-10

I have been a Grisham fan since the publication of THE FIRM and this is the 7th book I've read by this usually entertaining author.  However, I was very disappointed in THE SUMMONS.  I felt inundated with extraneous information and unnecessary characters and I also thought that about ¼  of the book was dedicated to promoting Grisham's next novel, THE KING OF TORTS (which actually sounds more interesting than this one!).<br />The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because the writing itself was good and I was motivated enough to finish it. I guess what kept me reading was my conviction that the plot twist would be less obvious than it actually was!	2003-06-03

I love reading novels about Asian culture and I have read all of Amy Tan's books as well as such masterpieces as &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. This book,while seemingly well-written and promising at its onset, left me flat (and slightly confused and depressed) at the end.  I found that while the general ideas of family relationships and Chinese cultures explored in this tale were somewhat akin to those topics explored by Amy Tan (one of my favorite authors), the characterization and story line lacked Amy Tan's depth.<br />May was the protagonist whose life seemed to begin with the cruel yet traditional binding of her feet when she was 5-years-old in China.  If anything, Ms. Harrison brings to light the cruelty of this practice as well as Western ignorance of Asian culture. The foot binding was the only time I really felt sympathy toward May.  ...And I didn't find Alice or any of the other characters terribly likable either.<br />If you are craving literature dealing with Eastern Culture of the past and present, better to stick with books like &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Kitchen God's Wife&quot;, or &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;.	2003-05-29

This fascinating work of non-fiction is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Unlike a lot of historical non-fiction, this intriguing story did not read like a textbook - it read like fiction and not once did I find myself skimming the details ... too interesting to skim through!<br />When I first heard about this story, I wasn't sure about it - after all, I really know (or should I say &quot;knew&quot;) very little about horse racing.  Despite my misgivings, I soon realized that a major purpose of this book was not only to teach the reader about this sport via Seabiscuit's career but also to memorialize the amazing individuals (Charles Howard, Tom Smith, Red Pollard, George Woolf, etc.) who defied all odds to make such a successful racing career possible.<br />I especially liked the chapters dealing with the difficulties of life as a jockey - the way the jockeys punished their bodies to the extreme for the honor of participating in a harrowingly dangerous sport was truly unbelievable...and I thought ballerinas were harsh on their bodies when it came to weight loss!  Red was my favorite character and I can't help wondering if the author felt a particular kinship with the jockey as a result of her own struggles with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - after all, she did have to push her own body beyond her normal physical limits to complete her research and write this amazing book!  <br />Ms. Hillenbrand successfully incorporated the story of Seabiscuit's racing career into the historical context of the era.  Seabiscuit was a much needed diversion for Americans who were suffering the depths of the Great Depression.  ...And perhaps, through Laura Hillenbrand, Team Seabiscuit is still providing us all with an inspirational diversion from today's distressing headlines! <br />Oh - and don't skip the interview with Laura Hillenbrand at the end of the book. It was very interesting to see how Ms. Hillenbrand's own background influenced her writing and how her research helped her to resurrect this intriguing epoch in American history.<br />I'm excited about the movie although I hope Universal Studios does this wonderful literary work justice!	2003-05-27

Okay - this is the second \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" book that I've read and, like DROWNING RUTH(Christina Schwartz), I disliked the story due to the disturbingly depressing plot. In DROWNING RUTH, the whole idea of a mentally-ill and controlling aunt (Amanda) ruining the life of her little niece (Ruth) after the girl's mother (Mathilda) mysteriously fell through the ice and drowned one cold winter eve was merely depressing; in FALL ON YOUR KNEES, however,the pervading theme of incest was more than distressing, it was just downright gross (and this is from an open-minded reader NOT easily shocked or bothered by sexual content!) Although I am always interested in reading books that deal with sensitive and even shocking topics (sometimes this makes a book more interesting!), I just don't find a need to experience incest in such poetic prose!<br />There's one thing I don't get - in the description on the back cover, the story is called \\"menacingly dark and hilariously funny\\" and it is also called \\"darkly humorous\\". Maybe I'm missing something or perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough, but I just don't see any humor at all in this distressing tale - and, like I said, I'm a very open-minded reader!<br />...	2003-05-20

This book was a fun, albeit slightly predictable, 1-day thriller.  For this I was truly grateful after being so disappointed in Mary Higgins Clark's recent fiction (I used to count on her for a good, fast read!).  Kathy Hepinstall is a talented writer whose ability to use her prose to create a suspenseful tale kept me intrigued from beginning to end.  <br />This first person narrative is \\"told\\" by Alice, an 11-year-old girl who has not only had to deal with her real father's abandonment but also a stepfather intent on draining all \\"nectar\\" (sweetness/joy) from her life.  Simon Jester is a possessive psychotic who demands the loyalty of his new wife, Meg, even if it means sacrificing her own children.  Nobody wants to believe Alice when she says that Simon is trying to poison both herself and her brother Boone and it isn't until her mother, Meg, sneaks into their room one night and whispers \\"RUN\\", that they finally decide to take things into their own hands and run away. The engrossing tale surrounding their escape introduced some fascinating characters, although the conclusions reached were not entirely surprising - I was able to figure out much of it ahead of time.<br />Despite the predictability of plot, I still found this excitingly well-written and I hope to read &quot;The House of Gentle Men&quot; and &quot;Prince of Lost Places&quot;.  I'll have to remember those next time I spend a day at the beach or on an airplane!	2003-05-18

OK -it was much better than \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\", which I found totally disappointing but it did not measure up to some of Mary Higgin's Clark earlier mysteries (such as \\"All around the Town\\" and \\"Loves Music, Loves to Dance\\"). <br />This is the story of Carly DeCarlo, a financial advice columnist turned investigative reporter, and her quest for the truth about the suspicious disappearance of Nicholas Spencer, the head of medical research company \\"Gen-stone\\". Nicholas Spencer, who also happens to be her stepsister's husband, has claimed to develop a revolutionary vaccine that could cure cancer as well as other genetic abnormalities.  His company was built on this premise and many stockholders were attracted with hopes of curing family members.  Even Carly was convinced to invest $25,000 in memoriam to her son Patrick, who died from birth defects as a baby.  So when evidence of embezzlement surfaced with the alleged death of Nicholas Spencer, the stockholders were in an outrage and even speculated that Spencer's disappearance was staged. Carly's reporting assignment led her to investigate the truth behind these allegations.<br />On a positive note, I must admit that the writing style was fascinating and led to a fast read (I finished the book in 1 ½ days!). Mary Higgins Clark intermingled the well-crafted first-person narrative that she attempted in DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL with sporadic chapters of 3rd-person narrative which were more in line with her earlier novels.  The prose kept me on my toes and engrossed throughout the story.  I just found Carly's character a bit unbelievable - how does one go from financial advice columnist to brilliant investigative reporter so quickly?  The plot and the isssues the story dealt with (i.e. medical research, corporate sabotage, etc.) were interesting enough, but...I don't know - the characters and even the ending kind of left me flat!<br />However, if you need an intriguing book to bring on an airplane or to read at the beach orby the pool, this book might be for you.  It goes by fast and, if you don't have any interruptions, you could probably finish it in one gulp!	2003-05-16

I stumbled across this book accidentally in the paperback aisle of the grocery store and thought it would be a nice break from some of my recent literary endeavors! I didn't realize how engrossed I would become in this entertaining and well-written tale!<br />This is the story of Sabine Heartwood, whose feelings mirrored Dorothy Gale's in the Wizard of Oz in the belief that \\"there's no place to home\\".  The tricky part for Sabine, however, was that her only home growing up was on the road with her gypsy-esque, fortune-teller mother, Ruby Heartwood. It is also the story of Danford (\\"Dan\\") Smith, who was reluctantly brought back home to take care of the affairs of his dying grandmother and mentally-handicapped uncle.  The story unfolds as Sabine and Dan's lives are intricately woven together in an intriguingly romantic fashion!<br />This book was the definition of a mystical, suspenseful and, above-all, romantic search for the true meaning of \\"home\\".  A revelation of pure and destined love!  I am looking forward to reading more of Susan Wilson!	2003-05-03

This tale follows the life of Trudi Montag, a Zwerg (dwarf) who we know spent at least the first 33 years of her life in pre- and post- WWII Germany. The changes in her town resulting from the horrors inflicted by war and time are all viewed through Trudi's eyes and the stories seem to be told from the perspective of a young woman whose differences set her apart from the other townsfolk from the moment of her birth.<br />As we are reminded of the atrocities committed in Nazi Germany to Jews and anyone who was not the Aryan ideal,Trudi's personal growth is explored as she spends her life coming to grips with her differences. By the time one reaches the end of this beautifully told saga, one realizes that while, on the outside, Trudi does indeed look different, she is not that different from most other people who have \\"stones\\" hidden beneath the \\"river\\" of their own lives.<br />Trudi is a remarkable character who used her gift of storytelling first for personal vengeance and later for the preservation of truth and soul redemption. And when it came right down to it, Ursula Hegi told the story of humankind's \\"longing for peace\\" and for the desire for that moment when \\"all the differences between people to matter no more... differences in size and race and belief ... differences that had become justification for destruction.\\" <br />This wonderful book ends as fuel for my imagination. Since Trudi is still a young woman when the book ends, I can't help wondering what happens to her as she grows old. Her fate will occupy my consciousness for a very long time!<br /> I found that Ms. Hegi's writing engrossing in both the flow of its prose as well as its content. I am looking forward to reading \\"The Vision of Emma Blau\\", especially since my appetite was whetted with references to Stefan Blau (who ran away to America at age 13) in \\"Stones from the River\\" - perhaps some of my questions about Trudi will be answered then!	2003-04-29

This was a typical Michael Crichton theme - you know, technology and science out of control due to human irresponsibility! Although engrossing, it was not my favorite Michael Crichton novel.  <br />The whole premise of this book was based on the science of nanotechnology.  My 2 major problems with the book were not the story itself (which was highly suspenseful), but with the fact that many parts got way too technical for the non-scientific layperson and there were too many different scientific elements.  In addition to nanotechnology, for instance, the ideas of predator-prey relationships, evolutionary development and swarming characteristics were explored.  Although these were all interesting topics and the author needed each of these elements to draw the story together, it got a bit confusing at times.  I found myself skimming the super-technical parts to get to the core of the story.  I also found the ending somewhat predictable.<br />I do think, however, that this could be adapted into a really exciting great screenplay and would translate well on the big screen (but first I want to see his book &quot;Timeline&quot; in the theaters! That was my favorite Crichton book!).	2003-04-06

Well, here we are again in Elmwood Springs, Missouri ... the same place that welcomed Dena Nordstrom back with open arms in &quot;Welcome to the World, Baby Girl&quot; (another spectacular book!) ... but this time, as six decades are spanned, we learn about the lives of those who made up \\"the most middle town in America\\" (p. 446).  <br />The Neighbor Dorothy Show on WDOT is used as a storytelling device - her broadcasts and family life being the focal point from which all other story lines emanate.  We trace the lives of her husband (Doc Smith, the pharmacist) and children (Bobby &amp; Anna Lee) as well as all those who come in contact with them (Norma &amp; Macky Warren, Beatrice the \\"little blind songbird\\", Jimmy, Betty Raye Oatman and the whole gospel-singing Oatman Clan, Hamm Sparks ...and of course, \\"Poor Tot\\" Whooten, etc.).  It is the story of small town America with charmingly real and in some cases, quirky, characters who would happily welcome you for dinner.<br />In her own way, even Neighbor Dorothy recommended this intoxicating tale when she said:<br />\\"...I only like to recommend books that are happy and cheerful...I know there are sad things out in the world...but I just don't like to dwell on them.  I guess I'm just like one of those ostriches; I just stick my head in the sand.  I don't want to face the facts.  All the scientists are determined to tell us what the moon is made of and what the stars are...and why there are rainbows...but I just don't want to know.  When I wish on a star, I don't need to know what it's made out of - let the men figure it out - as for me, if a thing is beautiful, what does it matter why.  I never get tired of looking at the moon.  One night is small and round as a shiny, ice-cold, white marble and the next it's a big soft yellow moon.  How can we get bored when nature gives us so many wonders to look at.\\" (p.305)<br />...And Fannie Flagg seemed to follow this advice when she wrote &quot;Standing in the Rainbow&quot;.  Sure, there were some sad and poignant parts ...but that was just part of the town's life. Like Neighbor Dorothy, though, the author didn't dwell on the sadness for too long and even as the world changed, Fannie Flagg's story is infused with optimism and hope! ...And with the state of the world what it is today, this is a wonderful story to read if you need that regained sense of optimism!<br />...Oh, and if my opinion matters here, I have a great idea for Fannie Flagg's next novel.  Wouldn't it be interesting to read a story about little Apple, Norma and Macky's granddaughter, who Linda adopted from China.  I would love to find out about her future ...and even her past!  If anyone can do it, it's Fannie Flagg!	2003-04-02

This intricately plotted \\"book-within-a-book\\" was truly unique.<br />When I first started reading this book, I wasn't quite sure about whom the book was written.  Was it Laura Chase, who committed suicide at the beginning of the book and went on to gain acclaim as author when her sister published her writings post-mortem? Was it Iris Chase (Laura's sister and the narrator)? And what about the \\"Blind Assassin\\" himself and his lover - who were they anyway?  <br />The plot alternates between the narrative of the elderly and ailing Iris Chase and the \\"Blind Assassin\\", as well as intermittent newspaper and magazines articles chronicling the Chase-Griffen saga.  While nothing appears interrelated at the beginning, it all comes together as the story unravels and reveals the entanglement between the sisters and how it molded their lives. Don't get discouraged by the intricacies - your patience will be rewarded and you won't be disappointed with the outcome!<br />This is the first time I've read Ms. Atwood's writing, but certainly not the last.

The couple behave like love-struck teenagers and live &quot;happily-ever-after&quot;!<br /> This tale was simple and sweet and I can't sum it up any better then Aaron Latham did in his toast to Gussie and Clyde at their wedding reception:<br /> \\"We are happy to be here today\\" - my heart was thumping irregularly or so it seemed - \\"because Clyde and Gussie give us all hope.  These newlyweds are going ahead of us, holding up romantic torches, to light our way to love, to being in love at any age.

They were both wonderfully drawn characters who, though from different worlds, managed to share a similar destiny.  Ms. Erdrich also created other characters with fascinating stories of their own while at the same time linking them all together in a meaningful way.<br />I've read some reviews stressing disappointment in the stark landscape portrayed in this tale.

I know that I was required to read Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; as a college freshman, but, 16 years later, this novel has made me interested in pursuing Dante's masterpiece with a whole new outlook.  ...Because, as the title suggests, this book is about the the historical collaboration of such great poets as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes, who created an American translation of Dante's work.  This novel, however, went beyond this basic premise when Matthew Pearl transformed this into a thriller/mystery in which Dante's Inferno is used as a vehicle for several brutal murders.  <br />I enjoyed this on so many levels:<br />1. The mystery itself was suspenseful and skillfully written;<BR>2. The social commentary was thought-provoking, especially the issue of censorship, freedom of press, academic freedom, etc.  This was touched upon in the discussion of how the Harvard Corporation attempted to stop the American translation of Dante;<BR>3.

The article discussed how many adult fiction writers have followed J.K. Rowling's lead and started writing novels geared to the pre-adolescent and adolescent age group.  SUMMERLAND caught my attention because I was, at that time, reading some of his other work and I thought it would be interesting to see how Mr. Chabon made the transition to the new genre.  More importantly, I saw that the book's theme revolved around baseball which is my passion.  What a I discovered was a  wonderful book for a baseball-a-holic/fantasy-fiction lover suffering from suffering from severe WBWS - \\"Winter Baseball Withdrawal Syndrome\\"!<br />This is the story of 11-year-old Ethan Feld, a mediocre ball-player at best, who was chosen to use his skills and determination to prevent the end of the world. He is joined in his adventures by some amazing characters - from friends from home to werefoxes, ferishers, giants and a Sasquatch - in his quest to defeat the satanic Coyote and his destructive Rade.<br />Although any lover of fantasy should consider reading this, an appreciation of baseball would probably be helpful.  I hope to see this in movie theaters - it would translate really well on the big screen if it is done right	2003-02-04

This book could kind of be called \\"The Sixth Sense, Amy Tan Style\\".  After all, there is a strange similarity between the first line of this book (\\"My sister Kwan believes she has yin eyes.\\") and the often quoted line from \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (\\"I see dead people!\\").  Yet, Amy Tan's tale is a story of Chinese mysticism, family ties, and modern and historical China - a fascinating albeit weird novel!<br />This is the story about the relationship between half-sisters Kwan and Olivia.  Kwan comes from China and serves as a mother-figure for the young Olivia, haunting her with tales of ghost and past lives. These mystical tales are engrossing because they also give a history of Manchu China.<br />This book goes where Amy Tan's other novels haven't - it actually travels to modern-day China.  This was my favorite part of the book!  The descriptions were so well-written that I felt like the characters who were seeing China for the first time.  I'd like to thank Ms. Tan for &quot;showing&quot; me this unique culture!	2003-01-20

Now that I've read 2 of Ms. Tan's novels (THE KITCHEN GOD'S WIFE and THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER) and seen the movie THE JOY LUCK CLUB, I can honestly identify her as one of my favorite authors.  Her wonderful story-telling ability, believable characters and fascinating exploration of Chinese culture and history make her stories some of the best I've read in a long time.<br />The story begins when both Winnie and her daughter Pearl are put in a position whereby they both have to reveal their secrets to each other. The novel, however, is dominated by Winnie's autobiographical account of her life in China before Pearl was born. <br />Winnie Louie told a fascinating tale of her life - a tale which included a strong focus on Chinese culture and history from a very human perspective.  She was a very strong individual who was able to survive and prevail through terrible hardships ...And she was still able to pass on a strongly feminist message about self-repect to her daughter despite the emotional and physical abuse inflicted upon her by her first husband in China. <br />This is such a powerful story dealing with the mother-daughter bond, friendship, loyalty, cultural differentiations, personal choices, courage and self-respect.  The story left me with a lump in my throat - feeling sad, touched and uplifted all at the same time.  I can't wait to read THE HUNDRED SECRET SENSES next!	2002-11-17

For years my mother has been suggesting that I read Fannie Flagg's writing and I just never got around to it.  Then one day I was watching some old episodes of &quot;Match Game&quot; on the Game Show Network and I realized there she was - Fannie Flagg herself.  I remembered watching her on that show as a child in the 1970s but I never connected her with the renowned author of today.  So this is when I decided to pick up the copy of &quot;Welcome to the World, Baby Girl&quot; that my mom had lent me several years ago.  ...And Mom was right, I LOVED IT!<br />This is the story of Dena Nordstrom (\\"Baby Girl\\"), a young and upcoming 1970s TV interviewer whose failing health leads her to seek answers about her mysterious family history.  In her search for the past, Dena learned many important life lessons.  ...the value of loyalty, privacy, family and love...the importance of slowing down to enjoy life.<br />Fannie Flagg certainly does create entertainingly real characters and paints a charming portrait of life in small-town USA (in this case Elmwood Springs, Missouri) ...as well as in other parts of the world (San Francisco, Vienna, New York, etc.).  But in the context of light-hearted prose, Ms. Flagg also makes important and powerful social commentary about subjects such as racism, media and fame as a whole. <br />I am looking forward to reading Ms. Flagg's other novels.	2002-11-08

Although I am familiar with Amy Tan's work after seeing and enjoying the movie adaptation of THE JOY LUCK CLUB, this is the first time I actually read one of her novels, and it is definitely on my personal Top 10 List for 2002!<br />Amy Tan is an expert at portraying the complex relationship between mother and daughter from generation to generation.  She also describes Chinese culture and traditions in a way that we rarely read about in  literature.  Her writing is so beautifully intriguing that I read her children's story, THE CHINESE SIAMESE CAT (PBS's Sagwa is based on this story), to my daughter last night and I found it equally compelling. Amy Tan has the ability to convey Chinese culture and traditions to every generation and I hope to read more of her work!	2002-10-30

I tend to enjoy novels dealing with the relationship between the living and the dead and this was a remarkable example of just that.  Ms. Sebold portrays the afterlife as a very personal experience - to each his/her own heaven ... or hell, for that matter.  Susie, who was murdered at 14 years old, chooses to observe her family for many years, witnessing the effect that her death had on the lives of those she left behind. <br />There were times when the book was a bit creepy, making me think that some dead person was watching my every move in a voyeuristic sort of way. And reading about the actions of a serial killer made me worry about my own children ...But it dealt so wonderfully with the process of mourning and letting go in times of great loss and it was also so marvelously suspenseful in certain parts that it was still a great read!	2002-10-25

It amazes me that after hundreds of years, Vermeer's art is so inspirational that 2 wonderful pieces of fiction about his paintings were published the same year (1999) ! After thoroughly enjoying GIRL WITH a PEARL EARRING (Tracy Chevalier), I was intrigued by this book by Ms. Vreeland.<br />Despite their major similarities, the general plot idea and structure was quite different and unique.  While Ms. Chevalier's novel dealt with the life story of Greit, the fictional subject of Girl with a Pearl Earring, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE begins in modern times with the current owner of the painting.  Each chapter is a short story unto itself and yet they are all connected by ownership of the painting as we travel back in time to the time when Vermeer actually painted the masterpiece.  Throughout the story, the power that the painting had over the emotions and actions of its owners is explored.  Therefore, it is ironic when Vermeer's painting subject doubts her own self-worth and her ultimate importance in the world.<br />A very helpful companion to both this novel and Ms. Chevalier's novel is VERMEER: THE COMPLETE WORKS (Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., 1997) because it features all the Vermeer painting discussed in these tales.<br />This was a very entertaining short novel and I would highly recommend it, especially if you truly appreciate the power of art!	2002-10-18

In High School English class, I remember learning how William Shakespeare often utilized the \\"play within the play\\" technique in his writing. Hamlet even said that \\"The play's the thing wherein I'll get the conscience of the King\\". Well, Ms. Brown puts her own spin on this technique by creating a \\"book within a book\\", thus \\"catching the conscience\\" of the villain. <br />Metafiction is defined as \\"a mode of writing that comments on its own activities, thus being self-reflective\\".  ENVY is a perfect example of that! I found it fascinating how both the psyches of a writer (Parker Evans) and an editor/publisher (Maris Matherly-Reed) were explored so thoroughly. Ms. Brown's ability to incorporate social commentary about her own industry (the world of the published novelist) into the plot was also intriguing.<br />The characters were wonderfully larger-than life and the suspense was masterful. After reading some disappointing suspense thrillers recently, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this page-turner, filled with all the twists and turns necessary for a great story! I just can't believe that I've never read any other Sandra Brown books - I guess I have a lot of exciting reading ahead of me!	2002-10-04

I have read several of Mary Higgins Clark's novels and have found them quite entertaining...that's why I find it so hard to believe that this is by the same author.<br />There really was no mystery to this book - it is obvious who the criminal is from the very beginning and there are none of the necessary twists in plot that make for an intriguing mystery. It was all just too simplistic and obvious for me.<br />...Maybe this is the typical example of a well-known author being able to publish and sell anything simply based on previous accomplishments!	2002-09-27

I actually heard about it from my sister-in-law who said it was her favorite book as a child and, after reading it to both my children (8 years old and 4 1/2 years old), I can see why!<br />This is a charming tale of how a small-town housepainter and his family achieved fame through the their amazing performing penguins.

I first heard about this book from some fellow educators who were planning to implement it as part of the English curriculum at an alternative high school and I decided to check it out for myself.  <br />This is a non-fiction memoir written by James McBride about his mother.  This is unique because Mr. Baldwin is black and his mother is a white woman of Jewish descent.  Sometimes real life creates the most amazing characters, and Ruth  McBride Jordon (formerly Rachel Deborah Shilsky) is one of the most incredible women I've read about in modern literature. Her amazing odyssey from her Orthodox Jewish family in Suffolk, Virginia to her life with her black family first in Harlem then in the projects of Brooklyn was like nothing I have ever read!<br />After reading this amazing memoir, I can definitely see why it is rapidly becoming required reading for high school and college student across America. It shows how one can overcome drugs and racial discrimination to become successful.  It also teaches important lessons about racial acceptance, religious tolerance and the discovery of hidden family background.  The latter especially fascinated due to my interest in genealogy - James McBride went in search of his mother's true background and discovered his unknown Jewish heritage.  FANTASTIC!	2002-09-26

Her prose is lyrical and I really felt like this was a story that could be put to music and enacted as an opera. ...It really makes me wish I knew more about opera because the descriptions were so mesmerizing ! If only it weren't so totally unrealistic! <br />Actually, I probably would have felt differently before 9-11-2001, before the reality of terrorism struck our nation as hard as it did. Perhaps the destruction of the World Trade Center, along with the happenings in the Middle East have jaded me to such an extent that I find empathy toward terrorists impossible! Knowing what I know, its hard to imagine that political terrorists, no matter how young they are, could develop such an attachment to their hostages and visa versa. I personally cannot find myself able to love any terrorists, even in a fictional setting! <br />Since I found Ms. Patchett to be such a talented writer, I would be interested in reading some of her other books. Perhaps I will find the plots easier to accept!	2002-09-19

Although the name Vermeer was unfamiliar to me, his art certainly was not.  It just took this amazing novel to help me make the connection between this 17th century Dutch artist and his artistic masterpieces.<br />Greit, the fictional subject of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, is a strong-willed young lady who does not let some of the degradation she experiences as Vermeer's maid destroy her spirit.  There is so much she is forced to deal with, from a plague-induced death in her own family to a shrewish mistress, a jealous maid, a lecherous patron, and a lustful and desirable master.  Yet her identity remains strong!<br />Ms. Chevalier's imagination and ability to weave such a fascinating tale from these paintings was truly amazing!  While I was reading this novel, I came across VERMEER: THE COMPLETE WORKS (Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., 1997) at the library and I found it to be a very helpful companion to this story.  The book displays all Vermeer's works as well as interesting biographical information.  I found it invaluable while reading Girl With a Pearl Earring, because I was able to visually identify all the painting referenced in the story.  I also found the internet itself a great source when trying to find out additional information about Vermeer and his paintings.<br />I found this book exciting in both the narrative itself and the fact that it reintroduced me to the works of this talented painter. Thank you , Ms. Chevalier!	2002-09-14

I really enjoyed this book ... it kind of made me think of many of the books I used to read by authors such as Chaim Potok (in its discussion of the acceptance and denial of Jewish mysticism and religion as a whole) and Judy Blume (in that it dealt with growing up with all-to-human parents, rites of passage and much more). ...And yet this is a book for adults and deals with adult emotions and issues! <br />The characters created by Myla Goldberg are wonderfully crafted. <br />* Saul, the obsessively scholarly dad/cantor;<BR>*Miriam, the mom secretly involved in a life of crime;<BR>*Aaron, a teenage boy who explores religions other than Judaism when cast aside by his father due to Eliza's spelling bee success;<BR>*Eliza, the mediocre student who suddenly replaces her brother in Saul's study and affections when she suddenly discovers her talent in winning spelling bees; <BR>The lives of all the characters are linked dynamically to each other and I found the book hard to put down because of them. I couldn't wait to see how everything was drawn together at the end!<br />A sign of a great book is one that keeps your imagination fueled even after finishing the last page ...and this story did just that! As I am writing this I still find myself wondering what religion Aaron will choose; will he return to Judaism? How will Saul cope with his family situation? What will become of Miriam? ...And will Eliza end up on top of the world ultimately -her wisdom before her time seems to indicate that to me! Lots to think about! Lots of fun!	2002-09-12

Remember that somewhat twisted fairy tale known as Rumpelstiltskin?  You know, it starts when a poor miller tells the King that he has a daughter who can turn straw into gold.  The greedy King decides to put this to the test and gives the maiden until morning to spin a room full of straw into gold - if she is unable to do so, she will die.  Hopeless in her task, the maiden is surprised when a troll-like man enters her tower and offers to help her.  ...With a price of course!  After she gives the troll all her material possessions, she is forced to offer him her first child once she becomes Queen.  Of course, once her son was born, she did not want to give him up.  So the troll gave her 3 days to guess his name - if she did this, she would be able to keep her baby.  By some stroke of luck, the Queen's messenger came across the troll dancing in front of a bonfire, gloating that his name indeed was Rumpelstiltskin.  Thus the Queen was able to keep her baby.<br />Dr. Frederick Starks' also had to discover the identity of a Rumpelstiltskin, but his path was paved with many more difficulties than was that of the Queen. Frederick Starks (\\"Ricky\\"), is a psychoanalyst who is thrust into a nightmarish version of this fairy tale when he receives a letter basically saying that if he doesn't discover the identity of the letter-writer within 15 days, he will have to commit suicide.  If he doesn't commit suicide, one of 52 family members whose names are included in the list will be tormented, ruined or killed.  Over the course of the next 15 days, Rumplestiltskin proves the seriousness of his threat by systematically ruining Ricky financially and professionally.  <br />Despite the fact the story was probably a bit longer than necessary (overdone description is some parts), this well-crafted and suspenseful story has more twists and turns than one can imagine and the game that Ricky is forced to play is both frustrating and intriguing.  Thought provoking social commentary is made throughout the book, touching on topics such as inadequate medical care, homelessness, Internet fraud and false identities. I also appreciated how Mr. Katzenbach referenced other literature, especially the works of Homer as well as greek mythology (not to forget the Brothers Grimm!)<br /> This would translate really well on the big screen, just as Hart's War  did!  Although I am having a hard time casting Ricky Starks - Bruce Willis and John Travolta crossed my mind but I'm just not sure!  Mr. Katzenbach and his producers will have to surprise us!	2002-09-12

The whole idea of a mentally-ill and controlling aunt (Amanda) ruining the life of her little niece (Ruth) after the girl's mother (Mathilda) mysteriously fell through the ice and drowned one cold winter eve just disturbed me.  ...And the ending was even more disappointing, leaving me with a tremendous feeling of hopelessness!<br />This was Ms. Schwarz's first novel, and I did find her to be a talented writer in that her literary style was intriguing.  The narrative alternates between the 3rd-person and the 1st-person.  The 1st-person segments were from both Ruth and Amanda's perspective and I liked these parts best.  It was this style of writing that kept me interested, despite my apathy toward the story.

Let me start by saying that I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this book!  It was fast-paced, intelligent, suspenseful and exciting, all the way to the very last page!<br />I first became interested in this novel after reading the cover story of the August 2002 edition of BOOK PAGE about Mary and Pamela O'Shaughnessey (&quot;Sisters in Crime: Career Crossroads turned Siblings into Co-Authors&quot;). These two women are sisters who use the pen name &quot;Perri O'Shaughnessey&quot; in their wonderfully unique brand of legal thriller - one in which the main character is a female attorney.  Even though the O'Shaughnessey sisters have written a number of these novels, I decided to get to know Nina Reilly from the beginning, which is MOTION TO SUPRESS.<br />I can't remember the last time I was so drawn to a character.  Nina Reilly is intelligent and strong-willed while at the same time being as human as the next person in her faults, doubts and desires - this makes her seem so real that one can't help but want to see her succeed.  I can't wait to read the next novel!<br />If you think you've had enough of the typical legal thriller, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this book.  Kind of a feminine combination of Grisham, COLUMBO and QUINCY.  Have fun with this one - and when you start it, give yourself long stretches of reading time.

Despite the confusing description of quantum physics (I always found physics a mystery) and a somewhat predictable ending, I have to admit that this was my favorite Michael Crichton book. I haven't read one since RISING SUN, and this made me remember why I always enjoyed his writing so much.<br />This was a typical Crichton novel in style and in the fact that it dealt with the concept of scientific advancement gone awry - however there was a neat historical twist. In a nutshell, the rapidly developing advances in quantum physics transported the main characters to the Middle Ages! Unforgettable characters and sweeping adventure would make this a great movie, much like JURASSIC PARK! <br />I also really liked the way Crichton portrayed the Middle Ages. We are so used to just hearing about knights and chivalry...sure, that did exist...but there was so much more to the reality of medievel life (ie - bubonic plague, unsanitary living conditions, brutal warfare, etc) and all this was touched upon, creating a realistic historical picture.<br />A must-read for both science fiction fans as well as history buffs!	2002-08-17

It was re-released in 2002 and I can't think of a more appropriate time to do so!<br />With the tragic attacks on our nation on September 11, 2001, it is wonderful to read this highly-readable, well-researched novel about George Washington - the man who helped to give us the freedoms we so enjoy today!  As Washington passes the presidential torch onto John Adams and returns to his beloved Mount Vernon, both he and his wife Martha (aka Patsy)flashback to their younger years. We're so used to stodgy accounts of Washington's military victories and political accomplishments that it was a pleasure to read a well-crafted  story about Washington as a man and a husband.<br />This is a short novel and a fast-read so it's a great beach or airplane book.

The story itself I give 2 stars, but I added an extra star for quality writing, page-turning suspense and interesting historical information. It's just that the story made me think more about death than I really wanted to!<br />I guess I should have known from the very beginning by the title -- Quietus is defined as \\"1. a finishing stroke; 2. discharge or release from life; 3. the moment of death\\". It says so right on the front flap! ...And she really means it! The book starts with a plane crash leaving the protagonist, Kylie O'Rourke, with terrifying ghostly visions and proceeds with many subsequent deaths.<br />I did, however, find fascinating Ms. Schilling's analysis of how views of death have changed throughout the centuries. She discussed the images of angels starting with early cultures, through the Middle Ages and the Reformation, up until the present. The research she did here was thorough and it was quite interesting.<br />So if you don't mind a book dealing with both the physical and spiritual aspects of death, than this might be a book for you. After all, it is well-written and suspenseful (although a bit too drawn out - found myself skimming through certain parts) ...But if those topics disturb and depress you, you may want to pass!  ...And I definitely would not consider this an airplane book - the book starts off with a tragic plane crash and the entire book is subsequently based on that!	2002-08-09

Just realize that the novel is intense and full concentration is needed in order to grasp the entire story line (not always an easy feat when you are the mother of two young children who are always competing for your attention, thus leaving me with even greater satisfaction in finishing this intelligent novel).<br />Talcott Garland reminds me of Hamlet - a man of inaction who is called upon to avenge the death/alleged murder of his father, Judge Oliver Garland. Like Hamlet's father, Talcott was contacted by his father from beyond the grave. In this case, however a note had been left and The Judge never actually said anything about being murdered - just some clues about \\"the arrangements\\". The suspense is there until the very end ...unfortunately the ending was a bit of a let down with many loose ends left. I hope Mr. Carter's 2nd book is a sequel that ties together some of the loose ends- it would make me feel a lot better about the ending of the book!	2002-08-03

Abandoned by his alcoholic mother and left for dead by all he knew, Edgar was an orphan left to fend for himself in the bizarre worlds of a substandard hospital, a horrid Native American boarding school and a sadly dysfunctional Mormon foster family. Through all his trials and tribulations, Edgar never gives in to hoplessness or despair and his perserverence leads him to a miraculous discovery about himself.<br />This was a most amazing odyssey, with characters both loveable and hateful...prose poetic, realistic and sometimes even gross!

Poetic and at times surreal (and sometimes a bit complicated), the author creates a world where not all Jews are portrayed as \\"nice Jewish boys\\", where characters such as Mila (Duncan's mother - a card shark and a gangster), Duncan and Isaac are larger-than-life but fascinating. The conclusion was extremely satisfying.<br />I feel that this story is very important, especially as the world loses many Holocaust survivors to old age. As those with the numbers tatooed on their arms pass on, we need someone to remind the world of the atrocities inflicted by Adolf Hitler on millions and it how it still effects current generations. Thane Rosenbaum has done that job in SECOND HAND SMOKE quite effectively!	2002-07-22

When I first started to read this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or even finish it. I had already read Ms Goodman's novels, KAATERSKILL FALLS and PARADISE PARK, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. I just wasn't sure if this would be more of the same ... the same characters...the same issues.  ...But I stuck with it because I enjoy her writing so much and I was pleasantly surprised!<br />THE FAMILY MARKOWITZ is a compilation of short stories describing different members of this complex family. From Rose, the family matriarch, to her sons, Henry and Ed, her daughters-in-law and her grandchildren, these stories span a period of about 15 years and delve into issues that face many families - religion, intermarriage, drug addiction, sibling rivalry, aging parents, etc.  I didn't love all the characters but I don't think you were supposed to - they are \\"real\\" people, created so well by an author whose true talent lies in her masterful characteriztion as well as with her literary ability.<br />I'd like to pick up a copy of her first collection of stories, TOTAL IMMERSION, next!	2002-07-11

This was the most fascinating book that I've read in ... well, I don't know how long!  THE BONDWOMAN'S NARRATIVE is a fictionalized yet seemingly autobiographical slave narrative written by Hannah Crafts somewhere between 1856-1860.  Hannah delves into the the mind and heart of a slave by telling the story of a young woman's personal experiences.<br />Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who chairs the Department of African American Studies at Harvard University, came across this hand-written manuscript at an auction for African American artifacts. He then embarked upon an amazing research project which explored the author's identity.  From scientific analysis of the manuscript (handwriting, ink, paper quality, etc) to actual genealogical research (census reports, etc.), Professor Gates attempts to prove that Hannah Crafts was indeed the first African-American woman to write such a narrative.   ...This is part of the book is intriguing although I do have one word of advice here - READ THE NARRATIVE FIRST!  If you read the Introduction first, you will know much of the story before actually reading it (in his discussion, he gives away the ending!).  By reading the narrative first, I found that I was able to reach some of my own conclusions before reading those of Professor Gates and I better understood the informative analysis!<br />I usually don't read books more than once but I would read this one again!	2002-07-08

A fast-reading glimpse into a 9-month nanny stint amongst the upper crust of New York society.  I flew through this book in 2 1/2 days and found it thoroughly entertaining (while disturbing at the same time)!<br />...And as far as being witty - well it certainly was, in a sarcastic sort of way! I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Grayer's extra-curricula activities. My children have been in some activities as well, and the descriptions were, in many cases, humorously accurate!<br />Being a one-time family day care provider and currently an at-home Mom who has been occasionally looked down upon by certain aquaintances as doing a &quot;nanny's work&quot; (i.e. - playing with my children, taking care of their day-to-day needs and activities!), I personally found this novel quite interesting.  I actually know people who take this hands-off approach to child-rearing and I never understood it. This book made me realize that I am not alone in these feelings!<br />...But let the reader beware: this is the combination of the authors' experiences and to say that all employers of nannies are this uncaring and cold would be doing an injustice!  First of all, there are always 2 sides to every story and I know of many instances of unreliable and problematic child-care situations. I also know of those who have had very good relationships with their nannies and have treated them very well in return.  So, enjoy this novel, but don't label unnecessarily!	2002-06-30

After reading both KAATERSKILL FALLS and PARADISE PARK, I feel that Ms. Goodman's talent lies in masterful characterization. From the lost yet loveable Sharon Speigelman of PARADISE PARK to Elizabeth Schulman and the surrounding Kaaterskill community, the characters are always interesting, always real!<br />KAATERSKILL FALLS is the story of a community of Orthodox Jews who migrate between Washington Heights (Brooklyn) and Kaaterskill Falls, an Upstate NY community, in the summer.  This novel deals with this community's relationship with both non-Jews and non-religious Jews as well as with their own feelings toward their religion.<br />I have read some reviews saying that this book went nowhere. My perspective is somewhat different:  Ms. Goodman writes here about a slice of life and life doesn't always have definite conclusions; it doesn't usually wrap itself up in a neat little ball.  Plateaus may be reached but there are always new mountains to climb and ongoing decisions to be made.The novelist, in my opinion, is intentionally leaving us with questions, thus enhancing our imagination and perhaps even leaving the door open for a sequel (How about it, Ms. Goodman? I'd love to find out how Chani ever managed to explore her budding yet forbidden Zionist sentiments! How does she ever manage to get to Israel anyway?)<br />I look forward to reading Allegra Goodman's short stories next!	2002-06-27

This is my first experience with his writing and his words flowed into my consciousness like an old friend!<br />This is a straight-forward tale of youthful innocence lost and a search for peace-of-mind despite past tragedy. When Scott Waring's young wife was brutally murdered by the Gestapo on their 1939 honeymoon in Berlin, he is forced to spend many guilt-ridden and lonely years trying to sort out his life. It was through the important influence of Max Leiberman, his abrasive yet honest psychiatrist, and his newly-found love, Janet Goldman - the young NYC waitress/dancer who survived the atrocities of the Holocaust - that helped Scott overcome the horrors of his past and his own ingrained prejudices.<br />This is called \\"The Bridge Builder's Story\\" for more than one reason. Sure - Waring is an engineer who builds actual bridges ... but he also builds symbolic bridges between past & present as well as bridges of understanding amongst different faiths, nationalities, etc.<br />A fast-moving, easy-read that would make a great airplane book. I look forward to reading more of Howard Fast's novels.	2002-06-21

I first heard of this book when I heard that the Rabbi at our synagogue would be conducting a discussion on Ms. Diamante's novel.  My first thought was to mentally prepare myself of some dry account of Biblical times.  Boy was I ever wrong!<br />This was a totally entertaining first-person narrative of the life of Dinah, Jacob's only and basically forgotten daughter - she is only mentioned in the Bible in terms of being a victim.  Her story, as much influenced by her mother(s)and the women of the red tent as it was by her famous brothers and father, begins when Jacob first entered the world of Laban and his daughters and follows Dinah through her life, through her joys and tribulations.  This sudden interest in women in the Bible in literature is refreshing since women are generally absent from the Bible!<br />I have to admit that this was one of the best books I had read in a long time and I found that I didn't want it to end! A must read for all (except if you are pregnant with your first child, in which case you may want to wait - a part of the narrative describes Dinah's experiences in midwifery and therefore there are many graphic descriptions of childbirth during Biblical times)	2002-06-21

It is wonderful that books are being written that show women's influence in Biblical times, especially for children.  Miriam is an inspiring heroine in her care of the Hebrew people, bringing them water even in the driest desert.  That's why we drink from Miriam's Cup on Passover and it is her story we read here.<br />My 7-year-old daughter, who is at the beginning of her religious education enjoyed the story and the illustrations and we now have \\"Miriam's Cup\\" at all our Passover seders.	2002-06-19

Attack in Jerusalem...Suicide bombings...Reoccupation of West bank...Bush proposal for Palestinian State...<br />Yes - the headlines are horrendous... and, as an American Jew, there are times when I find myself questioning my feelings toward the situation in Israel. ...That is until a book such as this, as told through the eyes of the 12-year-old son of 2 Holocaust survivors, comes along reminding me of the importance of Israel to Jews all over the world!<br />Panther in the Basement is set in in 1947 British-occupied Palestine.  While a real Underground is actively working toward the formation of a \\"Hebrew State\\", 12-year old Proffy and his friends are operating a make-believe underground movement. This first-person narrative tracks the growing pains of Proffy, from his \\"traiterous\\" relationship with British Sargeant Dunlop to his crush on his friend's older sister and, most importantly, to his understanding of a true need for a Jewish homeland as made evident through his relationship with his parents.<br />Once I got used to his style of writing, I found Mr. Oz poetic in his prose and I look forward to reading some of his other works.	2002-06-19

I have read all 4 years of Harry's Hogwarts experience now and I have to admit that this was my least favorite of the 4 books. It's not that the book wasn't entertaining - Ms. Rowling certainly wove an intriguing tale . It's just that I think she could have eliminated at least 100 pages, perhaps more. She seemed to take a wordy Dickensian detour, adding too much extraneous information in certain parts. This should not discourage Hary Potter fans who have not yet read Book 4 - Year 4 is very important in young Harry's life and after muddling through the extraneous, you'll find this a must read!<br />In any case, the rise of Lord Voldemort and the consequent discussion of good vs. evil comes at a time when the events of September 11th have forced society to examine these issues as they pertain to our own lives. The dark note on which this book ended makes me nervously anticipate Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts.<br />Keep writing, Ms. Rowling - the books are so much more important than the movies (and better too!)	2002-06-13

When I first started this book, I partially expected this novel to take a Harlequin romance detour. I was, however, pleasantly surprised when I was engulfed by this fascinating biblical era when Kings began to rule in Israel. Told through the words of King David's first wife and Queen, it is a fascinating tale of Kings (David, Saul and Solomon), prophets and the women behind them. Once I picked it up, I find it hard to put down and I finished it within a 2 days!<br />There style of this book is similar to THE RED TENT (I believe Anita Diamante was her Ms. Edghill's first agent.  Even though I liked THE RED TENT better, I still enjoyed this one and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Anita Diamante's novel.	2002-06-10

Although I have grown up as a Conservative turned Reform Jew in the metro-NY region, I can recognize many of characters in this book as Sisterhood and Temple Board members I have known. Ms. Mirvis insightfully portrays the well-meaning yet somehat alienating cliques who believe they know what's best for their community.  I also found this book quite educational, teaching me the inner workings of an Orthodox Jewish community.  I especially enjoyed reading the Q& A at the end of the book between Ms. Mirvis and the real Ladies Auxiliary, providing further insight into the novel and the author.<br />I am anxiously awaiting her next book!	2002-06-07
