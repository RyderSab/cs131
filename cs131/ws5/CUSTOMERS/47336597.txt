We see the lives of 3 women, Lisa, a determned workaholic with nor personal life- Ashling, the woman who wants to fix everything, and Clodagh, the beautiful Mother who wants whatever she doesn't have.  Lisa is sent by her publishing company to start a magazine in Ireland.  Ashling is hired as her assistant, and Clodagh is Ashling's oldest friend.  For four months we are treated to a glimpse into their day to day lives, and the story focuses more on Lisa and Ashling.<br />I though this was a little better than some of the &quot;chick lit&quot; books I read recently.  I like seeing how each character views things differently, and how their view shapes what they will do with their life.  I thought the plot was good, and fairly original.  The dialogue was snappy and realistic, and had me laughing and cringing at the same time.  I thought that the character behavior traits were explained in good form- throughout the story little details about the characters background come into play.  We are not hit over the head with these revelations, but are served them up slowly.  I like to understand shy a character acts in a certain way, and I think the author does extremely well.<br />My biggest problem in this book is the reliance on brand names, but I realize in a book about a women's magazine, these mentionings are inevitable.	2004-01-13
US	47336597	R3IJNS15NYWFL0	076791533X	40998123	Sixty-Six	Books	3	5	6	N	N	I expected more	This is a novel about a group of young men during events that happened to them around 1966.  It is told through the eyes of Bobby Shine, and we hear other tidbits from his life as well, but they all have a tie in to events that occur during the timeframe of the book.  We assume the author is looking back at his life from a distance of about 40 years, because he has the gaps of memory, of which incidents are important, etc.  We see how the sexual revolution, drugs, and the war all affect the men, and women that we meet.<br />I love the work of Barry Levinson on screen.  On paper though is another story.  THe characters in this book are one dimensional.  They have no soul.  And I never got their voice.  THough what each character does is unique, they all sound like the same person.  I never got to know anyone.  Their is simply not enough dialogue in this book-we are told but never shown anything.  I wanted to hear each character speak more, not the second hand version that is presented.  I know Mr. Levinson can do dialogue- it is the most brilliant thing about his movies.  I can't imagine why he didn't incorporate it here.	2004-01-08

She's wealthy, smart, a hard worker, and very stylish.  She's also single.  THis embaresses her Mother, but Bea is more pragmatic about the situation.  We also see a bit of a neighbor who was one of the last people to get Polio, and Bea's closest friend (if you can call it that) June.<br />The writing of this novel is fluid, and often beautiful.  The narrative is simple yet has depth.  THe dialogue, when we see it, is forced however.  By biggest problem with this novella is my wanting more.  We skip over years very quickly, and I sometimes would like more intimate detail of what characters are thinking.  THe glimpse into their lives is nice, but I felt I had to imagine too much on my own.  I was never able to get a good handle on any character motivation, or lack there of.  <br />THis would be a great novel to discuss in a reading group though- as there are many unanswered questions, and thought provoking ideas.	2004-01-08

Theresa, the heroine, is a lonely beautiful girl, daughter of hard working parents who are not as rich as their summer neighbors.  To make money, and get noticed by the right people, Theresa babysits, walks dogs, etc.  This is not a coming of age story, it is a reminiscience of a brief moment in time.<br />THe good thing about this book is the writing.  Much of it is lyrical and beautiful, and flows from page to page.  But hte plot of the book leaves much to be desired.  Things happen, but they are vague and underplayed.  I assume this was done on purpose, but it doesn't work for me.  It just makes everything that happens unimportant- days meld together.  And the character development is weak, as the main character is weak.  Theresa NEVER hangs out with anyone her own age.  For a girl who is supposed to be so beautiful, no one between the ages of 11 and 35 ever approaches her.  There are no girls from school calling, no trips to the ice cream shop, etc.  It is just weird.  All the adults we come across are strange as well- nasty socialite women, leering older men, the drunken next door neighbor, uncaring parents, including Theresa's own parents, who don't seem to care too much about what she's up to, or if she's happy.<br />Because of the time frame of this book, we never see Thersa grow, or change, which leads me to the question- what was the point of this book?	2004-01-04

This event brings notoriety to the town, and with the advent of reporters, Torie becomes interested in the legends of the ship- why it crashed- were there really diamonds on board- what happened to the heiresss, etc.  The reader follows Torie through her research, and eventually to solving all the pertinent mysteries.  Oh, and Torie finds out about a 1/2 sister that she never knew existed.<br />This is a quick, fun read.  The heroine, Torie is a great, well developed character.  She loves her family and her job.  She has a wacky best friend.  We learn just the right amount of information about her.  The other characters are good as well.  MacPherson doesn't introduce a million useless characters.  Things are given on a need to know basis, which is great, because you don't get bogged down with useless trivia.<br />This is not a suspenseful edge of your seat mystery though.  It is well thought out, and utilizes Torie's knowledge of history and research to come to a satisfying conclusion.  The writing is funny and well paced, the narrative snappy, and the descriptions detailed, yet not overbearing.<br />This is a good, fun who dun it.  Please read!	2004-01-04

She is homeless, pennyless, jobless, and stripped of her dignity.  She goes to live with her ecofriendly, save the world, dippy best friend.  The reader follows their world, along with the world of a co-worker thorughout the next month or so of their lives.<br />THe book alternates point of view from one chapter to the next.  Normally I like this device in a book.  It doesn't work in this novel.  You would need three interesting characters for this method to be effective, and unfortunetly, Matthews doesn't have any.  THe characters are shallow and sterotypical, and worst of all just not fun to read about.  Cara, the best friend is a vegetarian, which every book about 20/30 something women must have- her spin is that she's into loves spells, and relaxation candles.  Adam, the requisite love interest is a divorced Dad, with a bad ex-wife, and no interest in his career.  Declan, the ex-boyfriend drives a BMW, and heads up a dot.com.  The main character, Cara, is beautiful with a killer body.  Are you interested yet?<br />Despite the obvious character flaws, the book has some humorous writing, but not enough to offset it's flaws.  Though it appears to be a quick read, it is often dull, and I found muself skipping over many sections because they added no intrinsic value to the plot.<br />Would be OK to read if you're stuck on a plane, or if you have insomnia.	2004-01-02

Phoebe finds out on New Year's Eve that her husband and best friend are having an affair, and they plan on going off together.  She kicks him out of the house, and he ends up in a car crash.  Dashed by false expectations, she moves to New York to restart her life.<br />I have many problems with this novel.  1)  the plotline is totally unbeleivable.  She meets tons of people on the train, and they all want to help her.  Even in the 50's this would seem implausible.  And they are all fabulously wealthy- why didn't they fly from Chicago?  She meets a girl in the employment office and becomes her roommate?  <BR>2)  Phoebe is too melodramatic- I felt like I was in a bad dream sometimes- with her endless doubts and misgivings.  She is also a character who never grows or changes.  Why are we interested in her?  She is shallow and boring, and even her romances are shallow and boring.<BR>3)  The narrative is overblown.  There are no lyrical passages, no witty dialogue, or anything that would make this book worth reading.  Insignificant details are repeated so often that I even think the author forgot what she wrote.  This could be because the book is about 150 pages too long.<BR>4)  Too many characters- we never realy learn anything good about any of the characters, so why are we introduced to all of them.  It gets confusing, and doesn't help the book move along.	2003-12-30

While trying to get her ex to back off, she goes on a date with a man who inturn date rapes her.  She is emotionally traumatized, and that is the stuff with which the book is made of.  We follow Holly through the twists and turns of her rehabilitation as she struggles with going about everyday tasks, and watching her world crumble.<br />This is a difficult topic to deal with in a book, and Maxted attempts to use humor to diffuse some of the more emptionally tense parts,  Unfortunatley, this device does not always work- many of the jokes fall flat because they are ill timed, or ill conceived.  There are a few nice moments, but not enough to make this an interesting read.<br />THe book is also a bit long.  THe reader gets the same points thrown at them again and again.  This is a book that could be at least 100 pages shorter.  It seems to drag at points (another reason why the humor doesn't work)<br />The heroine, Holly, is also not that intersting a character,  I feel her pain, but more because of the situation than becaus of the way she is written.  ANd you want to kill her sisters!  THey are horrible!  <br />IF you have nothing better to read, try this, otherwise don't bother.	2003-12-28

Her bored, lonely, overbearing, nagging, widowed Mother moves across country to be close to her daughter.  In a typical Jane Heller way, her Mother becomes an overnight sensation.  And the mother/daughter roles become reversed.  THe daughter starts worrying about the mother in a nagging, overbearing way.<br />The book has some very funny moments as we see the daughter become a pain, and as we see a plain midwestern Mom become hip.  But in the begining, the mother (Helen) was too much of everything.  I got so annoyed with her at one point I almost put the book down.  It's a little too in your face, and I understand why Heller did this, but I still didn't like it.<br />My favorite thing about Heller's books are her strong 30 something characters.  I always like seeing woman who are vulnerable, but still persevere, who are not gorgeous, but have healthy attractive looks.  And who are fine living without a man.  This is Heller's greatest strength, and it makes Stacey Reiser a good, beleivable, and funny heroine.<br />A fun, fast paced read- try it.	2003-12-28

Martha is a retired lawyer living in New York City's Greenwich Village.  She still does freelance work, and though 74, her mind is still sharp.  Unfortunetly, she discovered her next door neighbor, the President of the Co-op board, dead.  Of course she gets intrigues by this and can't stop thinking about the murder.<br />We meet all the various neighbors, and learn why they might be the murderer. I found the characters types very sterotypical, for as a lifelong New Yorker, everyone who lives here has their own little quirks, and I thought her characters needed more personality.  Everyone we meet is very flat.<br />I also think this book would work better in 1st person.  We see the story through Martha's eyes, but I don't think a narrator is effective in this type of book- it distances the reader too much.  It is also a &quot;folksy&quot; type of novel, and dialogue and narrative would work better if we were in Martha's head.<br />As a who-dun-it, the story was a little weak.  It didn't take a genius to figure out who the villain really was, though she tried hard to 'confuse' the reader by introducing about a thousand unimportant, and uninteresting, characters.<br />IF you have nothing better to read, it will pass the time, but it is a book to be borrowed, not bought.	2003-12-23

The plot is fairly interesting- ugly ducking woman embezzles money form the accounting firm that she works for. We learn about the computer investigation unit of the NYPD, which is more interesting than it appears.  We meet a varitety of different characters along the way, and we find out how New York City can be an easy place to get lost in.<br />I had a few problems with this book. <BR>1) The amount of characters.  We are introduced to a lot of didderent people in this book, we start to learn about them, and then they pretty much disappear.  I think more attention should be paid to fewer characters.<BR>2)  One-dimensional characters- many of the people are very predictable sterotypes- the macho Italian cop, the pampered housewife, the sexy office manager.  A few are fine- when every character is cliched it gets a little much.<BR>3)  The ending is just not right.  It is too pretty.  I wanted something more.<BR>4)  I didn't like any character in the book.  Not one.  I had no sympathy for anyone.<br />But, outside of this, the book is a fast read.  The plot is interesting and entertaining.  Better than your garden variety beach book.  And there is definatley some humor to be found- Block's style of writing is snappy and cute, and wordwise she is not trite at all.	2003-12-22

The plot is straightforward- upper middle class Indian girl wants to be married.  Her parents want her married.  Her town wants her married.<br />It was interesting to hear about a woman's perspective of doing what is right and expected in India, even at the present time, as it is vastly different from what we Americans know.  Unfortunetly, I don't have much knowledge as to how representational this book really is, and though I enjoyed hearing this side of the story, I still had difficulty beleiving that this is how things are.<br />I was conflicted about the heroine Anju.  On one hand she is a rising star on the PR front, but she is also a devout Hindi who has set up a prayer shrine in her studio apartment.  I could not get the two halves of this character to mesh in my mind as far as a work of literature goes.  Her New York friends are too sterotypical for me, and I wasn't moved by her Indian relations.<br />I think the story would work better if it was done as a journal- the amount of interior monologue is oppressive.<br />But, the book is easy to read, and you do wonder if Anju will ever find love, so I think there is a definate audience for this book.	2003-12-18

THe plot is pretty good- political consultant decides to take on an unwinnable case- her ex ( a journalist) is accused of treason.  We go through lots of Washington politics- how you get to see the people you need to know, how important being being best friends with the matre'd of a restaurant is, how a nice bottle of champagne will get you everywhere.  Kate Boothe guides us on this journey.  We see her battle audits, vengeful old friends, scheming new enemies, an assalt on her reputation.  We see her fighting the good fight, saving an innocent man who everyone has turned their back on.  But it is just not a very interesting literary journey.<br />Mitchell makes the mistake of telling not showing.  Their are many positive personality traits to Kate, but we hear about them in narrative rather than in dialogue.  I needed to hear some of her intelligence, wit, and media smarts.  This did not come through to me.  She becomes just like every other mediocre heroine I've ever read.  There is nothing to separate her from everyone else, and since this is the story of Kate, it makes for a very average read.<br />The humor is trite, the characters are forgetable- I even think Mitchell forgets why she introduced certain characters.  Th eplot is definately good, but the story that goes along with it isn't.	2003-12-17

On one hand, it is a very readable story- it is easy to while away a snowy afternoon turning the pages and absorbing yourself in this book.  However, there are SO many faults with the plot.  THe story is way too contrived- woman almost never leaves the house, does not speak to anyone over the phone except to place work orders, sees a little girl in her backyard, and within 8 days she is transformed.  She's called old friends, made new ones, got a new job... And all because of a too precocious 9 year old girl! It has to be fiction.  Never has there been such a neat, happy, ending, where all things are as they should be.  Near the end of th book, Lucinda is remarking that she can't beleive it's only been a month...well, neither can we.  It's totally impossible to beleive  that this could happen to anyone.<br />But plausibility aside, the book has its moments.  The language is simple, and for anyone who does not wish to see a bad ending, this is perfect.	2003-12-09

THe story is generic- woman trying to make her mark in Hollywood before she gets too old, but it's the way that the story is told that makes it interesting.  Christine is 35, about to get divorced, and in search of &quot;it&quot;.  Her new goal is to produce a documentary about Richard Gault, a &quot;secret celebrity&quot;- he was on the verge on huge success in the 70's, and then he dropped out.<br />As the story unfolds we meet her cast of characters- they are all artfully drawn characters.  Wolper presents us with enough information to make them alive, without going into overload and boring the reader with the minute details of their lives.<br />The pace of the book is brisk- the lines funny, the character traits are very funny.  It is exactly how I want to view a book about Hollywood- light, humorous, a little social commentary.  <br />My only problem with the book is the amount of pop culture references that are thrown in- I realize that any book about Hollywood must include these, but they unfortunetly date a book- the book is out before it's even been published.  Two years from now the novel will loose much of its potency, and that's a shame because it is a fun book.	2003-12-08
US	47336597	RRT2HK3T16ALH	0684869403	299270934	The Wife, A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Powerful	This is a powerful read.  THe heroine of the story is Joan, anolder woman who has been trapped in a marriage that she doesn't really want to escape, but on a plane ride to celebrate her husband's greatest achievement, she decides she must leave him.  The reader is taken into a flashback mode of the events of her relationship with Joe, from how they met, and what led them to get together.  <br />I found this novel powerful because of the way it explores Joan's feelings about herself, and about her life.  True, the author does not give us a blueprint of the hows and whys of Joan's actions (or lack of), but I felt I got a good sense of what Joan is all about.  She was a woman who got caught up in worship of a man, who didn't understand her place as a woman in the 50's and 60's.  She willingly put up with all the garbage that Joe through at her, never listening to her own intuitions, and she never searched for her own happiness- everything she did was to make Joe love her, and to make Joe happy.<br />I did not feel sympathy for Joan- she was not particularly likeable to me, yet I was compelled to read her story.  I've seen many woman that are her age, and I see their bitterness, their distaste for the decisions that they made, the sacrifices, and that's where I think the author hit the nail of the head.  She captured the lonliness and disillusion of the 60ish woamn, who stayed with the husband because that is what they thought was right.<br />The prose is simple and straightforward.  I thought some of the dialogue a bit pretentious, but it is a novel about authors, so I can understand the elevated language.  I thought the chapters were a little long, and I think that certain passages lost their power by being in section that was just too lengthy.<br />I recommend this novel to all woman, of all ages, because I think there is a little regret in everyone, and I think it is wonderfully captured in this novel.	2003-12-07

It is the story of Alison, wa woman in her thirties who is widowed when her husband dies in an accident.  Like some woman in this situation, Alison romanticizes her relationship with Marty to the point that she is unable to get on with her life in any concrete way.  After two years of wallowing in misery, she begins to rebuild a totally rundown 1976 Corvette.<br />THe novel is cleverly written.  Each chapter heading is a section of an automotive repair manual, that gives you a brief description of what Alison is going to learn in the ensuing chapter.  <br />What I liked best about this novel was the complexity of the characters that we meet.  There are no wasted characters.  Everyone we meet is well texted, they are complete, and they have strengths and weaknesses, and some are not all that likeable.  Most of the dialogue is good- to the point, few embelishments, and very realistic.  You capture a nice picture of small town America.  I was not always happy with the interior narrative of Alison however.  Sometimes I felt the narrator was a little too detached, and I guess this supposed to be part of Alison's character, but it separated me a little too much from Alison, and sometimes I really didn't like her character.  This is always a big literary sticking point with me- how is the reader supposed to feel about the hero?  Are we supposed to like them, or is that too pat?  <br />I also didn't see the pattern of Alison's growth very clearly.  I don't like things spelled out, but I think the reader needed to make too many leaps and guesses as to how Alison's character developed throughout the novel.  I guess I was not convinced of any real transformation.<br />But, that aside, I think this is a novel that deserves to be read, and discussed, and reread.	2003-12-05

It is basically a simple tale, no fantastic plot twists, nothing special, or so you think.  The line is simple- a woman's only daughter is shot by the police in a case of mistaken identity.  After this tragedy, Miriam (the Mother) flashes back to incidents in her life that have shaped the person she is today, and in her thinking, have lead to this unimaginable tragedy.  It is a wonderful journey!  THe story is told with clarity and grace, and the wisdom of one who has seen and heard far too many horrible things.  The narrative is poetic, the dialogue beleivable and the characters are multidimensional, even the ones we only meet briefly.<br />This book made me cry.  Very few novels move me like this.  I was transported into Brooklyn, into Miriam's life.   I felt her anger, her rage, her fear, her hopelessness.<br />I have one very minor criticism though- the character of Bird uses dialogue that is beautiful, and intelligent, and thought provoking, yet he uses the slang terms of &quot;Cat&quot; and &quot;Brother&quot;.  I realize this was the vernacular at the time these scenes were supposed to take place, but it doesn't fit in with the rest of his speech.<br />But please read this novel.  It is so wonderful!	2003-12-03

I picked a snowy, cold New York day to begin this book, and I admit it was pretty easy yo keep reading.  The pace is as brisk as Becca's walk, the dialogue is cute, the characters are sterotypical, yet believable for this type of book.  Sure the plot is fairly predictable, it includes the overtight Mother, the witchy social climber, the precocious child, but there isn't much to think about.  Their is decent chemistry between the hero and heroine, so at least the inevitable outcome is fairly understandable.<br />On the downside, the editing of this book was fairly sloppy, and I noticed some continuity problems- characters said things that directly contradicted things they said only paragraphs before, and she should visit New York again, because Rumplemyers closed awhile ago.<br />I also have a problem with the amount of characters she introduced, gave big descriptions of, and then never to be seen again.  I only like characters that are incidental to the plot, especially in a fun book.<br />This book is not a great literary achievement, but it's fun and easy to read.  If they had 1/2 stars I would actually give it a 3 1/2.	2003-12-03

The story is OK, but I think my daughter misses some of the things from the TV show that can not be replicated in a book (such as, Swiper's expressions or comments, the little jingle- tree, bridge, tall mountain)  I try to add these touches but it's not the same.<br />Other than that, it is well constructed with hard pages, and the pullouts are easy, but not all that exciting when you slide them open. Before opened, the panels blend into the background, with just a dark shape highlighted.  When you slide open the area, the shape correlates with the picture below (circle and Tico's car wheel) Also as a parent, I would like the the shapes on the <BR>plastic sleeves to be more basic- if a book is going to touch on shapes, let them all be pretty basic.<br />If your child is a Dora fiend they will probably get some enjoyment from this book, but I think there are better books out there.  I gave it 4 stars because it is cute and well constructed.	2003-12-02
US	47336597	R5CDMAQFJAXZT	0380977338	622869821	I Wish I Had a Red Dress	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Beautiful and Uplifting	I thought this book was wonderfully inspirational.  It follows the story of Joyce who has had far too much tragedy in her life.  Another author writing this story might have made it trite or cliched, but the approach is fresh and interesting.  By using clever dialogue, we receive many insights into Joyce's life, and why she behaves the way she does.  Her character is strong yet vulnerable, and it is nice to see a character that is like a real person, and not a steroetype.  Joyce grows not in leaps and bounds, but in baby steps, and it was very beleivalbe to me.  Too many times I have seen characters make huge transformations apparently overnight, and it gets tiring!<br />I enjoyed reading this novel- strong female characters, interesting storyline- all the things I want in a book.	2003-12-01

I can not say that about many novels that I read, because the majority of literature today is a series of active scenes connected by sexual encounters, or wishes of sexual encounters.<br />I enjoyed reading this novel of a variety of levels.  I found it to be an interesting story, told in a very readable format.  The chapters are all short, and they are told from the various viewpoints of the 4 major characters.  I normally enjoy a story told like this because I enjoy seeing different aspects of the same situation (you know the saying- there's what he said, there's what she said, and then there's the truth).  I do agree though that this novel does start to get repetetive, especially towards the end.  It's almost as if the author got bored by the time she got to the last quarter of the book.  But the sections in the beginning are very powerful, and give you a good incite into the characters and their behavior patterns.<br />My major literary problem with this novel is that the reader is given little knowledge of Ava's mother, and this information is doled out at practically the end of the novel.  Given the nature of this book I felt that this relationship whould at least have been mentioned more than just in passing.  I realize this was supposed to be some sort of literary device, but it didn't work for me. Ava's character was incomplete to me, and though I finished the book last night, I am still thinking about her motivations.  Score one for th author because I continue to think about the book, but take one away because I am not thinking about the many wonderful things this book has to offer.<br />The language of th novel is simple and poetic and beautiful.  Many of the passages were almost lyrical, and it was a pleasure to see language so simplistically, yet creatively used.<br />Though I have some problems, I do recommend reading this novel.	2003-11-30

It is a board book, so it holds up well to wear.  When my daughter likes a book she tens to read it over and over, so durability is important.  I like the fact that she counts fruit, but some of the fruits are a little obscure for my daughter to remember- I've never seen a guava so I can't imagine how she will make the connection.  I like having the numbers written in Spanish, and the phonetic pronunciation guide is helpful as well.<br />This is also good if you own any of the videos, because Dora counts a lot, and the repetion of the numbers is helpful.	2003-11-24

I consider myself a fairly creative person, but this was just a bit too spiritual for me.  I thought her anecdotes were average, and I thought the exercies were trite.  If you are seriously one dimensional, I think this book might help, but if you are accustomed to keeping a journal, belong to a writing group, visit museums on your own, you will be way past this book.	2003-09-09

This book was a gentle passage of a boys recollection of his first love.  It is a beautiful story, and filled me with laughter and tears.  I rarely read a book these days that touches my emotions, so this was a revelation.  <br />I can't wait until my daughter is older, so that I can pass this on to her.	2003-09-06

She lays down a very simple framework about what our children should and shouldn't do, and it is an extremely helpful guide.<br />The format is very straightforward.  The beginning of each chapter spells out what the law is.  She adds a \\"real life\\"story about inappropriate behavior, and she follows up with how you can truly get good behavior again.<br />As a busy mother, I found the book easy to get through, and not too clinical.<br />The only thing I didn't like was some parts of her chapter on bullying.  Some of her ways to stop the child from being bullied seemed to be a bit off target.  Otherwise, this is a great book on parenting.	2003-09-06

I read this book for the first time yesterday, and it immediately became one of my favorites.  It takes place on a dig somewhere outside of Bagdad.  It is told my Amy Leatheran, a nurse who is asked to be a companion to one of the people at the site.  The tone and manner of this narrator makes for a fun read.  I also liked the perceptions of a young, independent woman, as we don't normally see that in Christie's works.  We see Hercule Poirot as a more minor character, which is interesting to me.	2003-09-05

We feel how difficult everything is for Bobby, how tough it was for him to just get by day to day.  His Mother does not seem to have a great support network, which also makes it hard for them to survive.<br />My only problem is that Francene seems a little underdeveloped.  I needed more of her, and that would help me see Bobby better.	2003-09-02

The protagonists of all the stories are confused, disillusioned, compassionate, and searching for what is just out of their grasp.  They are bleakly comic, and highly thought provoking.  I can't get some of these stories out of my mind.<br />I especially enjoyed &quot;Ellen's Book&quot;.  It made me think about  many different facets of relationships, and how you never know what will or won't hold couples together.	2003-08-27

The subject matter was bleak, yet it had purpose.  Stream of consciousness can be quite enlightening when done right.  Unfortunetly, I could not get involved in this book.  Perhaps it was because it is a translation, but I don't know.  There were certain passages that were quite lyrical, while others left me totally lost.  Perhaps one day I will try this book again.	2003-08-27

When we say the sense, she points to the corresponding body part on either herself or her doll.  Anything that helps my daughter learn while also having fun is worth the money.	2003-08-24

One can't help but enjoy the wry humor of the heroine China, and the odd assortment of characters in her novel.  I am always happy to find a heroine who is of a certain age, but who is still smart, sassy, and sexy.  <br />Sometimes Albert goes into a little too much detail for my taste, but this does not really detract from the general enjoyment.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a brisk, humorous mystery novel.	2003-08-22

Bourdain is willing to try anything, and I liked living vicariously through his food lust.  (Though a lover of food, there are definately things I would never eat)<br />The only chapter I had fault with was his chapter on French Laundry.  Having fantasized about that restaurant for years, I was hungering for a more detailed description of the 20 courses that he sampled- what exactly were those 20 courses?  And the courses of the other guests.<br />My one hope is that Bourdain decides to keep searching for great food!!	2003-08-21

Allen's prose is sparse, but she is able to create evocotive word pictures, and I am able to see every situation clearly in my head.  She is able to tell a story with the right amount of detail- we don't get bogged down trivia.<BR>    The stories deal with African American women of varying ages and social situation.  They center around a situation that will color the women's attitude forever.  My favorite was about a young girl who discovered the body of a homeless woman along the side of an abandoned railroad yard.  The girls confusion about the how's and why's of the world, were both beautiful and sad.  But whether the stoy was about a 9 year old girl, or an older widow, all the heroine's were searching for some sort of lost innocence.	2003-08-18

Being totally fascinated with felines, she fell in love with it.  The illustrations show a variety of different breeds, and as she's grown, she has begun to understand the differences.  The poem is very cute, and she enjoys listening to it.  Some of the cat facts are quite interesting and I'm sure as she gets older she will appreciate them more!	2003-08-13

I realize the hero gets involved in uncovering the truth because of where the &quot;body&quot; was found, but I was very bored by his thought process.  The main character was boring, and lacked any sense of humor.  I didn't get a warm feeling from his interaction with other characters in the book, and that made his search for the truth unbelievable to me.  And I hate unmentioned characters who show up at the end!  This is not a plot twist, it's just the authors way of &quot;stumping&quot; the reader.<BR>This isn't a bad book.  I just wouldn't classify this as a mystery.	2003-08-11

It is slow, overly attentive to detail, and oversimplifies the obvious.  The explanations and \\"origins\\" of things we are accustomed to are laughable.  Do not waste your time on this book.

Luckily these women are successful, witty, intelligent, and capable.  I find this very refreshing, as I am hard pressed to find novels where the heroines have these characteristics.  <br />The story here however is a little thin.  I did not enjoy this as much as I enjoyed some of her other novels.  The male characters are a little one dimensional, and I feel I've seen them a thousand times before.  And for a fresh approach to the &quot;husband leaving wife for a younger woman&quot; scenario, I found the ending too predictable.	2003-08-08
