I'm always impressed with an author that can make likable characters out of cold blooded killers.  It's a page turner.  I haven't read any other of his books, but I will after having read this one.	2005-10-12

I think that the author did a wonderful job bringing the words to life.  It is a mystery, yet not as much \\"who dun it\\" as figuring out the intricacies of others lives, which Mm. Ramostswe does with such class and humor. <br />This is the second time I've read this book and I think I enjoyed even better the second time.  A must read for those who just like a good entertaining book.	2005-10-04

However, the story is not unbeleivable at all. <br />I thought the essence of the 70's/hippies era was very well portrayed, the good and the bad of that time. <br />Cedar grows up very familiar with smoking pot, drinking and sex.  Her father Sol has her rolling his joints for .25. <br />Cedar and her Momma live in an old beat up farmhouse - with no heat or toilet. They first live with Sol (Cedar's father), then they move in with another couple and their kids and Daniel (Mom's lover), whom they met when they were on the road running away from Sol.  Everything is in harmony until Topaz comes to live with them and catches Daniel's eye, nothing goes right at the farmhouse after that. <br />Cedar and her Mom move to Grandma's house - which forces them into a more conservative lifestyle.   <br />This is a great book, especially if you lived through the 70's, but even if you didn't it is a good portrayal of those of us who did.	2005-09-30

I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.	2005-09-23

Until I read this book, I really had no idea what a great musician he was.  I'm a fan of Arlo, but knew very little about Woody.  <br />Woody's parents didn't have it easy - his father, Charley didn't like to face the reality of what was happening to his wife, he would drink so he didn't have to face it. <br />Woody explored just about every belief looking for answers, answers to life and how to live his life.  He was mostly interested in the Communist Party and their beleifs. <br />At times Woody was a counselor to those who were lost, sick,  hungry, wanting work and he would give them \\"commonsense answers\\", the people would go away satisfied with what Woody had to say to them. <br />Woody would quite frequently sing his songs to down and out families in migrant camps, always identifying with the workers. <br />Woody began to suspect the same illness that haunted his mother was effecting him also, he knew that Huntington's disease could be passed along generation to generation.  <br />My heart breaks for all the people who loved Woody and for Woody himself.  It's a tragic story, but one worth reading.	2005-09-23

This book was not - it was just a long boring book.   The first story was about getting his dead mother off the island, which actually was one of my favorite stories, but only because of the black humor of it.  Some of the stories were written in a dialect that was very hard for me to understand.  \\"Lord Short Shoe Wants the Monkey\\" was just a weird story - I couldn't really get anything out of it.  It might be because I'm not familiar with the Caribbean, therefore I couldn't appreciate the stories, whatever it is, I will not be keeping this book in my library.	2005-09-23

I just went back to read the first paragraph and it still doesn't really make sense to me - but after I got through the first chapter I was hooked.  I didn't rate it a 4 because the author skipped ahead of herself, leaving what I felt was important details behind.  Perhaps that was her intention and in a way it was refreshing because you couldn't get bogged down by details.  The characters weren't terribly believable, yet they were likeable.   <br />This is an easy read, so if you want something to just take your mind of the mundane of life, I would recommend you give this book a try.   <br />I liked it enough to give another one of her books a try.	2005-09-01

I love the image Pitt gives off \\"In fact he was downright scruffy, clothes all a mismatch, pockets full of rubbish.\\"  I forget that he looks like that because he's so good at his detective work.  I'm sure him a Charlotte are a bit of a mismatch.  I don't get the impression Charlotte is anything but neat and tidy. <br />This book had both Charlotte and Pitt in it, the lovely Aunt Vespasia and Charlotte's sister Emily, all my favorite characters.   <br />Pitt has his own brush with the law and it's left up to Charlotte and Emily to solve this mystery.   <br />If you only read one of the Pitt series, I'd make it this one.	2005-09-01

The women of the Victorian times are trying to break out from some of their perceived roles as women. <br />Having read these in order, it's fun to see characters reintroduced. <br />With all the shows on TV, like CSI,it's fun to see what things they did to identify bodies, how long they could keep a dead body, etc. <br />Very enjoyable read. <br />	2005-08-18

It felt like a soap opera and the circle of people and incidents just kept getting smaller and THEN it picked up and I truly enjoyed the ending.  This time Perry had me fooled all the way to the end.  <br />The book was more involved around Charlotte than Pitt, which I enjoyed.

I applaud Perry for addressing the subject and the depraved way people can use other people, and what people will/have to do for money.  Perry obviously feels very deeply about the abuse of children.  Unfortunaltely this is something that could happen in the Victorian times as well as now. <br />It isn't always hard to figure out \\"whodunit\\" in Perry's mysteries, however she still weaves an intriguing tale. <br />I was confused on whether this was Perry's 5th or 6th novel in the Pitt series, but I read it as the 5th.   <br />I appreciate Perry's descriptions of the surroundings of her subjects, I am able to visulize it, feel either the warmth of the fire, or the coldness of the weather.	2005-05-27

There were also some plot lines that were just a little too farfetched.  It was a great read though.   <br />There was a lot I could identify with in this book and it was reassuring to me remembering God's unconditional love - not only what Angel felt through her husband and friends, but also finding out that God walks through all the times with us, the good and bad.  I think Rivers did a very good job describing the shame Angel felt, unfortunately that is felt too often by actions (voluntary or involuntary) of our past.  A great book for everyone to read. <br />	2005-05-27

I learned a lot about the Jewish faith. One lesson learned was the fact of how much our life can change by just one indident.  Mr. Potok makes each of his characters lovable no matter which view they hold.  The culture the author shows us, is foreign to a lot of people, including me, but I think it is a part of history that is important to our society.   <br />The parental side of this book is told well, each father loving their sons with such a passion, but each showing it in the only way they know how - a conflict with their traditions and religion.  <br />It's hard to write a review about just one aspect of this book, since it is layered with emotion, love, tradition, life changes, friendship, and hard lessons.  You could read this book over and over again and come away having learned something you didn't quite catch the first time.   <br />I'm looking forward to The Promise, I'm not quite ready to let go of Reuven and Danny. <br />A must read.	2005-04-29

I usually don't like short stories, but Julie is an excellent writer and drew me into each story.  I think my favorite is \\"The Isabel Fish\\" which a young girl is blamed for the death of someone else due to drowning and how she tries to process it.  All the stories are about children and how they view and process different and hard situations.  A very well written book.	2005-03-27

The General was a pathetic old man who seemed to be living a life of self pity.  I got tired of his whining.  I know Gabriel Garcia Marquez is very respected for his writing, but I just couldn't get into it.  I guess I prefer books that I feel I have something to learn or are atleast entertaining.	2004-08-28

Towards the end when another new character was introduced, it was too much.  I didn't think it wrapped up well, either. <br />I will try another on of his books, but he'll have to put a little more substance in his writing for me to become a fan.	2004-08-28

Any reader no matter age or gender can appreciate the different characters and the roles each one of them play in this book.<br />It's a wonderful illustration on how love truly does win over evil.  A must read for every age.	2004-08-22

I loved the way we grew up with Johannes.  This book was well written (I didn't give it 5 stars because there were a few parts I rolled my eyes), but other than that, worth the read.    The spirituality the desert and Indians brought to the book was one of my favorite parts.  There is life bigger than us - L'Amour was able to express it in an entertaining way.  Unlike one of the other reveiwers I felt he expanded on the characters of the book - and the last 50 pages or so I couldn't put it down - always a sign of a good book.	2004-08-20

L'Amour holds true in this book to his theme of education, peace loving (unless forced to be otherwise) and a little romance.   <br />The book didn't pick up for me until the end.	2004-08-14

This was the most boring, pathetic book I've tried to read in a long time.  I love history, I love the Christian theme, but I couldn't even finish this book.  I read 1/3 of it , but even reading that much was laborous.  Don't waste your money on this dribble.	2004-08-09

It doesn't stray from L'Amour's style or his normal writing, which ofcourse is what makes this a great read. <br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about the old West, who like adventure and romance.	2004-08-09

I read &quot;The Brethren&quot; before this book, but didn't become quite as attached to the characters as I did in this book.  Even though Clay was greedy he captured my heart and I couldn't wait to see what happened to him.  <BR>I thoroughly enjoyed this book for an easy and fun read.	2004-07-14

There had to be something positive about the job, or she wouldn't have been a policewoman for so many years.<BR>Having a policeman for a friend, I did appreciate some of the insights into how they may feel different from &quot;civilians&quot;.<BR>It's a very sad tale of how many people live and how instead of the police being encouraged become discouraged.<BR>I struggled with how to rate this book, because it's discouraging and haunting, with no upside I wanted to rate it a 3, but Gina does a good job of writing and relating her experience, so I rated it a 4.	2004-07-01
US	44013468	R2VW1Q4W0XGQK3	0374525641	65032227	The Spirit Catches You and You Fall down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Must Read	This book is a must read.  It is thought provoking, educational and hard to describe.  I kept wanting to place judgement on the doctors, then I wanted to place judgement on The Hmong families, when really there was no judgement to be placed.  This book is about cultural issues that impacts many lives.  I liked the fact that Anne Fadiman didn't seem to have an agenda, she told the facts as they happened and as she saw it, without her own prejudices.  With so much prejudice in our society I think this book might help us each be a little more tolerant.	2004-02-24

Pearl Abraham is able to capture details that the reader can relate to.  Unfortunatley, this scenario happens too frequently, not enough thought put in to the relationship before marriage.<BR>It was interesting however how the author's insight into Deena's denial and &quot;allowing&quot; Daniels other relationship.<BR>Daniel's character wasn't developed, which was disappointing, but maybe the author only wanted us to see it from Deena's point of view.  <BR>The good thing about this book was it was an easy and entertainong read.  <BR>The bad thing was it is a sad story that is told too often.	2003-10-15
