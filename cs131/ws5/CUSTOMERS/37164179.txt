It was difficult to put down, it kept my interest.  Apparently, it is the first book in a series of 5? about the Hellfire League (Englands most exclusive Rogues).  I may check out the next one, The Passion. <br /> <br />In reading this, for some reason, I started thinking of the Tom Cruise movie, Eyes Wide Shut.  This book showed, in detail, the  <br />steamy underside of London, the perversions available that city <br />held.   <br /> <br />One of the things that struck me while reading the book was how, no matter where the story drifted, Nicole Jordan always managed to get me interested in her story telling.  I think she could write any kind of book she chose to write, she is so good in so many ways.  What I mean is, she has talents writing heartfelt stories, love stories, seductive stories, mystery stories, although this particular book didn't hold a lot on the 'mystery' dept., I can see how she could do that as well.   <br /> <br />The funny thing about this book was, how the prologue started off on the steamy side, then, when the first chapter actually began, it switched over to blackmail, then, till about 1/2 way through the book, the tenderness & sadness took over, then, the next quarter or more of the book was about depravity & debauchery. <br />The last part dealt with love, for both couples.   <br /> <br />Though this is not my usual kind of book, it was a nice change to read something different.	2005-07-09

I just finished this book last night, and I have to say, there are some books I hate to see draw to a close, and this was definitely one of them.  It is my first Jacquie D. book and it won't be my last.  If her other books are even close to this one, they will be winners, too. <br /> <br />I love Jacquie D's humor!!! I smiled and smirked and laughed thoughtout the book.  People on mass transportation probably thought I was nuts.  These characters, even the minor ones, are so well presented.  The story was excellent.  I was rivited and could not put it down.  <br /> <br />Eric was wonderful.  His alter ego, the Bride Thief, was outstanding.  Samantha was great -- she is one of the best heroines ever!  She has it all, except for looks, but that doesn't disuade Eric in the least.  He likes that her eyes & lips are too big for her head.  She's a brainiac, she's witty, she has charm & charisma that make up for her lack of physical beauty. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the side story, about Adam, Eric's best friend & the magistrate of the county, and Margaret, Eric's tortured sister.  It was a beautiful love story that deserves a book of its own. <br /> <br />	2005-07-09

Just like The Duke & I by Julia Quinn or The Pirate Lord by Sabrina Jeffries or Taming Rafe by  <br />Suzanne Enoch, this one really zipped by & even with my busy <br />schedule, I still read it in 2 days' time. <br /> <br />Now, if you want a substantial plot, a mystery to be solved, or a cunning villian, or a less steamy read, then this book will not be for you.  But if you're in the mood for laughter, 'need-an-air-conditioner-because-it's-so-incredibly-hot-in-here' sex scene,   <br />Kleenex when you start crying at the end, then this is the right book for you.  It may depend on your mood, or your individual preference, but use this as your guide. <br /> <br />About the sex scenes -- the raspberry scene was most inappropriate at the time it took place, I thought.  Either earlier or later in the book would have been better.  To me, a really caring husband would have waited at least a few more days  <br />after a miscarriage to go that far with her.  It was 3 weeks later, but I still thought it too soon for such a sensual scene. <br /> <br />Also, I had no use for the scene eariler in the book where he decides to try something different in their lovemaking.  I was disappointed because, after some initial discomfort from her, she   <br />was willing put up with what I think was a disgusting act on his part.  And yet, later in the book, when she discovers he is not 31 but is 25, she had a real problem with that.  Go figure. <br /> <br />Despite these 2 scenes, I really liked the book.  It zipped along at a brisque pace, the sex scenes were not the standard for a historial romance -- they were very vivid, erotically charged. <br />They tended to remind me more of a Lori Foster book than something written by one of the diva's of historical romance. <br />If ever Lisa Kleypas were to try a career in writing erotica instead of romance, she would most likely succeed.   <br /> <br />One thing I did miss, though, more than an unsubstantial plot, a mystery, or a villan, was a sideline romance.  There were no <br />sideline romances between other characters in this book.  Sometimes, I enjoy the sideline romances as much, if not more, than the main romance. <br /> <br />It kept my interest, and I would definitely read another Lisa Kleypas book again, though I can't imagine one being much spicier than this one.   <br /> <br />4 1/2 stars	2005-07-04
US	37164179	R174YCMY87GFMY	0843935197	437359270	Never Call It Loving	Books	4	10	11	N	N	To me, Jamie Covington was the true hero of the book	I liked this book very much, but it took me awhile to warm up to it before coming to that conclusion.  I liked the hero's friend, Jamie, better than I did him. <br /> <br />I will tell you why I wasn't fond of Cameron.  Cam was a tortured hero, in every sense of the word, so I guess he had a right to feel a little self pity for himself, but I had trouble forgiving some of the things he did, such as refusing to honor his wedding vows on his & Marisa's honeymoon, then seeking out a prostitute the very next afternoon.  Another thing that happened, more minor in nature but grating nontheless, was his flirting with the king's whore, Barbara, right in front of Marisa.  Barbara was another immature character.  Luckily, most of the characters in the book had integrity & redeeming qualities.  It took Cam most of the book to grow up, accept responsibilities, embrace his wife, his estranged mother, and all but forgotten daughter. <br /> <br />Now, about Jamie (James) Covington.  His scenes were written very poetically.  I loved his scenes!!!  He fell in love with Marisa's cousin, Brianna, and proposed marriage by a lovely creekside. <br />Brianna, a wonderful woman, had secrets of her own, and was only in it for a 1 time tryst.  After he proposes & she doesn't give him an affirmative, he succumbs to her wishes for lovemaking. <br />He is gentle, tender, kind, just the kind of man she is looking for.  He dresses & declares to God above that she is his wife in everyway.  She is teary-eyed, and refuses to believe it.  She goes home, ready to pack, but he finds out from Marisa what she plans and they have a much needed talk.  He tells Brianna he'd rather have a wife whom he loves that can't produce an heir than a wife he doesn't love who can produce an heir.  He proposes again, and this time she accepts, telling Jamie that she will do it on 2 conditions -- that a priest officiate, and that they do it as soon as possible, as she is anxious to get on with their new life together.<br /> <br />But, anyway, back to Cam & Marisa.  Marisa was a great woman, and for much of the book, I felt she deserved a better man than Cam, because of the way he treated her, or lack thereof.  It takes these two a long time just to get any real dialog going, because Cam doesn't want to be involved with her.  He's only her husband because the king ordered it.  She feels a sense of duty to the king too, but she is very kind hearted and knows there is room for love to grow, if only Cam will give it a chance. <br /> <br />Later in the book, the disgruntled lover who disfigured Cam puts in an appearance, threatening their safety, but Marisa takes care of her by shoving her out a 4-story upstairs window.  But before this happens, Cam had a lot, and I do mean a lot, of growing up to do.  He finally comes through in the last 3rd of the book. <br /> <br />Other characters I liked besides Marisa, Jamie, and Brianna, would be Cam's father, Angus; Kendall, Cam's valet; Barbara,  <br />Marisa's grandmother; and, towards the end of the book, Cam's <br />mother, Alanna.   <br /> <br />Despite Cam's immaturity until over 1/2 way through the book, I'd give this book about 4 1/2 stars.  He never did admit to using a prostitue right after his nuptuals to Marisa.	2005-07-03
US	37164179	R15AOIL7KEA5E8	0505520923	895889592	Traded Secrets	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Civil War time travel	This is the first time travel book I've read having to do with the <br />Civil War era.  In fact, this is my first Civil War era romance I've ever read. <br /> <br />It wasn't a book with a lot of humor, and I didn't go into reading it expecting any.  The plot showed a great deal about the lives of <br />confederate soldiers at that time, especially wounded & dying ones. <br /> <br />Jacob & Savannah were a great couple.  She came from 1996 into  <br />1862, and he is a confederate doctor in that time.  They fall in <br />love, but not without many pitfalls.  Savannah thinks she is fulfilling her destiny by helping the wounded soldiers, but before the book is out, she finally realizes that Jacob is her <br />destiny. <br /> <br />Savannah sincerely wants to help the soldiers, but in order to <br />do so, she needs plenty of medicines.  The problem was, she was <br />not allowed (this is where it gets a bit complicated) by her <br />time-travel aide, to bring back anything that wasn't already <br />being used in that time.  For instance, aspirin, though not <br />available in the United States at that time, was available in <br />Europe, therefore, it was a medicine that her time-travel agent <br />would allow her to use.  There was a catch here -- Mathilda <br />(the time-travel helper) required that Savannah bring her certain  <br />historically-valuable items she could sell in her antique store in 1996, in exchange for these medicines (this is how Savannah <br />gets these medicines without ever going back to 1996). <br /> <br />Also, there is a villain, in the form of her ex-fiance's ancestor.  His name is Jordan, and she is attracted to him until she realizes he is the same sort of schmuck her ex-fiance was <br />in 1996.  Since Jordan dies at the end of the book, I can only <br />come to the conclusion that the ex-fiance was never born in the <br />the future.  Jordan tried to use Savannah for his purposes & <br />died trying for his efforts. <br /> <br />On a1-10 scale, I would give the book at least a 9.  It was <br />very good.  I see on Amazon where a \\"Vickie Presley\\" has a book, <br />and I am wondering if it is the same author.  If so, I might be <br />tempted to check it out sometime.  Victoria Presley should definitely write more books, especially time travels. <br /> <br />4 to 4 1/2 stars.	2005-06-28
US	37164179	R37TOHJT8279IU	0843948167	525184008	Lady Pirate	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Daniel & Valoree	I enjoyed this book very much.  It is the 4th one of Lynsay's I've <br />read.  I agree with the one reviewer, I thought the story would have thought that Valoree's 'aunt' would have been interesting if she were a prostitute, however, since she wrote her with a small sideline story of her own, it was actually better that way.  Lynsay's stories have mystery involved, and the story involving 'Aunt Meg' was the mystery here.  I do think Lynsay could expand into the romance/mystery genre if she chose to do so & do very well at it, too. <br /> <br />Nearly every romance written has one of the main characters being <br />a bit more stubborn than the other main character.  In this case, it was definitely Valoree.  She was the big holdout in this book. <br />But, to her credit, her thought processes were amusingly written. <br />Daniel saw the benefits of their being married long before Valoree ever wised up to it.   <br /> <br />The only thing I found a bit odd in the story was that his friend    <br />never recognized 'Aunt Meg'.  He had to be told, by his mother, <br />who \\"Aunt Meg\\" really was. <br /> <br />I got a big kick out of Valoree's suitors.  Maybe not so much them as the way she went about obtaining them.  I also like the way she continued to dress as a pirate, wearing her breeches & <br />boots under her society dresses, and the way she would scale garden walls whilst wearing these dresses.  What a hoot! <br /> <br />4 1/2 stars to Ms. Sands.  Will read more of hers again in the future.	2005-06-27
US	37164179	R3JPQ656TF9AB4	006051969X	448727659	The Duchess Diaries	Books	3	2	3	N	N	The Duchess Diaries, Volume One	I have a lot of mixed reactions to this book.  First, let me address the cover (which I understand is out of the control of the author):  I think the hero looks like he should be on the cover of a romance about Indians.  My friend looked at the cover & said the same thing, \\"Is this book one of your westerns?\\".  So, no fault to the author here, but it would have helped a bit if the cover had been a better one.  Maybe after she's written a few more books & has more clout, she may start to get better covers. <br /> <br />Some of the other reviewers here did not like the heroine, but liked the hero.  I was kind of the opposite.  I liked her more.  Where she lacked in the intelligence department, she made up for in spunk & determination.  In regards to him, I thought his character was a bit underdeveloped & I had a difficult time <br />getting a clear picture of him in my mind.   <br /> <br />The villan of the piece turned out to not be much of a villan, and before the book is done, he's already turned over a new leaf, <br />admitting to one & all his devious ways & fleeing the country! <br />Oh, brother!  The true villian, was his one-time love, who rejected him once she found out he was crippled for life.  She was a relentless gal, and there is not one redeeming quality about her.  She was probably the most interesting character in the book, when it comes down to it. <br /> <br />I'm not sure how badly I care to read the next 5 volumes of The Duchess Diaries.  I might possibly check out Amelia's or Rachel's <br />(these 2 show the most promise), but I have a feeling that the  <br />Regina, Emma, & Lissie ones won't be so interesting, though I could be wrong. <br /> <br />My overall rating for this book is 3 1/2 stars.  Cute idea, just wish I'd liked it better than I did.	2005-06-18
US	37164179	RPFFVF0ARTOWJ	0380798867	562252278	Taming Rafe (The Bancroft Brothers)	Books	5	5	7	N	N	O.M.G. -- Possibly THE best romance I've read to date	I would love nothing more than to give this book way more than 5 stars, but Amazon won't allow it, so I'll do my best to extole its virtues. <br /> <br />When Julia Quinn, Amazon reviewers, or anyone says that Rafe Bancroft is the ultimate romance hero, they are NOT kidding. <br />I think it would be impossible to not adore & admire him. <br />This was truly HIS book.  Yes, there is a heroine (Felicity), but <br />even she takes a backseat to this incredible man. <br /> <br />Rafe may have been a rogue, scoundrel, cad, rake, etc in his previous years, but his is one mature male now.  It does not take him long to realize he is on the path to maturity & making his family proud.  He doesn't do what he does to make them happy, but it is a sideline benefit.  He does what he does because Felicity is everything he has ever wanted, but he didn't know it.  He spent most of his life either in the army or running away from <br />England on trips around the world, just to escape his friends & <br />family (but especially his snooty friends). <br /> <br />He uses his engineering skills to help out in the reconstruction of Felicity's birth home.  He does not just supervise, he gets in there & does the dirty work, right alongside all the other workers, and does not give a hoot that he is the 2nd son of a Duke.   <br /> <br />His relationship with Felicity is wonderful, and his relationship with her younger sister, May, is great.  It does not take long for him to realize that not only is he doing something he loves - carpentry - but that he loves Felicity & 8 year old May as well. <br />I can't believe the chemistry between him & Felicity -- it is awesome -- and the excellent interaction & dialog between him & <br />May.  May is a very smart & very funny young girl for her age of 8 years.  May thinks highly of Rafe and she does not let anyone say anything bad about him when she's around. <br /> <br />Most of the characters in this book had integrity to the max. <br />Rafe, Felicity, May, Rafe's relatives, and some of Felicity's <br />neighbors, all had loads of it.   <br /> <br />Now for the villian -- I do wish he had been killed at the end of the book, because sending him off to the constable wasn't adequate, in my opinion.  He was the lowest form of low & most definitely a sociopathic character. <br /> <br />This book, for me, ranks right up there with The Pirate Lord by <br />Sabrina Jeffries and The Duke & I by Julia Quinn as being the best historical (a.k.a. 'ton') romances I've read so far.  I can't praise it enough. <br /> <br />My only hope is that Suzanne Enoch & Karen Hawkins (who wrote Lady in Red) would get together & write a book for May Harrington & George Baker-Sneed (George is from Lady in Red).  I think they <br />would be a great couple -- in about 10 more years! (Both are 8 years old in their books). <br /> <br />I will most definitely read more Suzanne Enoch literature in the future, and I will absolutely keep this book and read it again. <br />This book is NOT to be understated. <br /> <br />As May Harrington says, \\"Rafe is 'top of the trees' and 'smashing'\\".	2005-06-15

This was an enjoyable read. <br />Devon is the toughest nut to crack of the brothers thus far (only <br />one left to go).  It was so sweet, the way he was always going to <br />visit Kat at her workshop.   <br /> <br />The intimate scene was interesting ... a smidge bit kinky at first. <br />Also, in this part of the story, guinea's are mentioned, so I was <br />curious as to their size.  I did some research, and they are quiet large, actually.  The hero liked her 'guineas'. <br /> <br />I loved the way the ring was 'passed on' to Marcus at the end <br />of this book (Marcus is in the last book, \\"Lady in Red\\"). <br /> <br />I would give this book, and the others so far, 4 1/2 stars each. <br />They are near perfect books and I honestly can recommend each one.	2005-06-15

The plot, wherein Chase plays The Captain with amnesia is really cute.  It seems like everyone in Harriet's <br />family is willing to go along with his plan, but her mom seems <br />to be in denial -- she really wanted Chase to be \\"The Captain\\". <br /> <br />The whole book was thoroughly enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed <br />the last chapters, and Chase's birthday present from his brothers. <br />I also like the way the ring was passed on from Chase to Devon for <br />the next book, The Bride Wore Plaid.	2005-06-15

The biggest diasppointment I suffered was the <br />place in which Marcus decides to deflower Honoria.  His behavior reminded me of how a teenage boy might act in this same situation. <br />He couldn't even wait till they reached their 'honeymoon' destination (such as it was).  That was another complaint I had -- <br />they had only ONE night on the outskirts of town for their <br />'honeymoon'. <br /> <br />Another thing I didn't like, was the way Honoria teased Marcus <br />with dangling the ring under other prospective buyer's noses. <br />During the scenes where she does this, she makes the reader feel as though she could not care less about his family's most precious heirloom.  Very disappointing, with her being his <br />love interest & all.  I wondered if she could be trusted.  As it <br />turned out, she could, but I did have occassional, momentary <br />doubts at different times throught the story. <br /> <br />Now, the pluses to this book -- there were a lot of them -- my <br />favorite character, from the second book (Confessions of a Scoundrel), the butler turned coachman, Herberts - puts in an <br />appearance here.  He is everybit as funny here as he was in <br />Scoundrel.   <br /> <br />Other characters I liked were Cassandra, the eldest Baker-Sneed <br />relative after herself, and George, the youngest Baker-Sneed son. <br />I have not yet reviewed \\"Taming Rafe\\" by Suzanne Enoch, but I <br />can tell you, Karen Hawkins & Suzanne Enoch should get together & write a book for George Baker-Sneed and May Harrington.  It would <br />take place several years after this book & Taming Rafe, and I  <br />would purchase it without a second thought!  George was great! <br />And, the French chef in this book added something special to <br />the end. <br /> <br />I will now attempt to try to rank these 5 books in my favorite order:  1.  Confessions of a Scoundrel  2.  An Affair to Remember 3.  The Bride Wore Plaid  4.  How to Treat a Lady  5.  Lady in Red.  1st & 2nd place are tough, because I loved these 2 books <br />the most.  Overall, I think An Affair to Remember has the best <br />story, but Confessions of a Scoundrel (and later, Lady in Red) <br />had the best character - Herberts. <br /> <br />One last thing -- this is one series that I believe should most <br />definitely be read in order of publication, because of the way <br />each story ends, it ties directly into its successor. <br /> <br />Eventually, I'll read another Karen Hawkins book, but for now, <br />I'm taking a breather. (Marcus, the biggest hold out brother <br />of the bunch, wore me out.  Evidently, Honoria eventually wore <br />him out, too, because he finally came around in the last few <br />pages of the book).	2005-06-15

The comic relief was provided by Herberts, Verena's shady butler, who was recommended to her by the  Society of Wayward Women, or something like that.  The man was a pickpocket, bigtime, never missing on opportunity.  Why she put up  with him is anyones guess, but I think, even with her modest means,  she could have got a different one if she wanted to.  It was nothing short of amazing to me that he did not steal the Talisman  Ring.  He certainly had plenty of opportunity.  Motive?  I think he  just liked the jingle of shiny, expensive items in his pockets.  He never tried to hawk any of it.    But on to the story.  I liked how the lead female, Verena, was not a virgin.  In fact, she was very aware of herself in regards to her passionate tryst with Brandon.  She knew what she wanted,  was never whinny.  The story was never about the usual things,   like I'm too poor for him (although there was an angle to the  story similar to this), I love him, but does he love me?, etc.  like most romances are.  Verena has to be one of the strongest  female characters I've ever read about in romance.  Anna was very  strong in the previous book, so I suspect this may be the norm for Karen Hawkins' writing.      The plot was just busy enough to keep a person interested, but not so busy as to be too difficult to keep a person's interest.  The plot was serious, but the interjections of Herbert & his antics throughout helped to lighten the load.      I would just like to know what happened to Wycham & Peters.   I assume Wycham was either sent to prison for a short stint or  was given a small allowance & sent on a boat to America.  With  Peters, I really have to wonder, because Herberts took over his  duties as coachman at the end of the book.    Another 4 3/4 star book from Karen Hawkins.  I'm looking forward to the next one, How to Treat a Lady.	2005-05-29

I wanted to give it 5 stars, and if it hadn't lagged in the first 1/3 of the story, it  would have been.  I guess I was anxious to get past the introduction of characters & on to the plot.    I don't generally enjoy romances with children in them, unless the  children truly add to the story, and in this book, they were a huge & important part of it.  The first part of the book, I just wanted to slap Desford, the oldest.  I really detested that kid.  But as the 2nd part of the book progressed, I found myself starting to warm to him.      Some of my favorite characters were Anna's grandpa - how he fancied himself the owner of Anthony's library; Selena & her  memorable scene at the pond (if you liked the croquet scene in  Married to the Viscount by Julia Quinn, you will love the pond  scene in this book!); Charlotte, how she changed from a simpleton into a very enlightened woman, thanks to Anna's assistance; and  Rupert, how he went from someone, living with minimal wealth, not a care in the world, to someone who found someone to care about, & how it changed him overnight, how he became a responsible person, just from his caring about her.  Suddenly, his financial future did matter, as he wanted to provide adequately for his beloved.    As for the main characters, Anthony & Anna, they were wonderful.  It was nice to read a book where the lead male finds the lead  female's legs more interesting than her chest (though it was  well endowed), for a change.    The pond scene being my favorite scene, my next favorite had to  be the play the children put on at the end of the book.  If not  for this play, the characters might have been forever held in limbo.  It was embarrassing to many of the characters, but necessary to tie up the loose ends & finish the story.    I really wanted to give this 5 stars, if the first portion had had a bit more umph, I would have.  So, my rating is 4 & 3/4 stars.	2005-05-29

It was my 4th Eugenia Riley book, and she has yet to <br />disappoint me.   <br /> <br />I was amazed by all the time travel in the book.  Bella goes to <br />1896, not once, not twice, not three, but FOUR times, and believe <br />it or not, it makes perfect sense with the plot each & every time. <br />The first time she was propelled back to 1996, I was shocked, but <br />once I saw where Ms. Riley was going with her plot, I totally understood.   <br /> <br />Bella is a woman unsure of singing capabilities, preferring to <br />not be in the limelight, to be a part of the chorus.  If she has <br />to do a trio or a duet, it is too close to a solo for her & she <br />panics.  She loves her grandmother in 1996, but is torn between <br />being able to sing a solo for her, and her attraction to Jacques <br />in 1896. <br /> <br />Jacques is a tenor of the highest order.  He is just as well known for his womanizing ways, infamous for it, in fact.  When <br />Bella enters his life (maybe I should say 'each time she reappears in his life), he is certain that she is the one who <br />will fulfill his destiny, to both be his bride and to sing <br />solos with him around the world. <br /> <br />In 1996, Bella is aware, due to her research, that Jacques is <br />murdered in 1896.  Each time she comes back to 1996, she finds <br />out more information in order to try to stave off his impending <br />murder. <br /> <br />The book got a little hairy for awhile, when it looked like <br />Jacques was going to follow her into 1996.  This never takes <br />place, and I understand why, although part of me would like to <br />have seen either them switching places in time, or perhaps <br />meeting half way between 1896 & 1996.  But, as I said, the way <br />Eugenia Riley writes this, it is appropriate & well done. <br /> <br />Now, if you like time travel, especially a lot of time travel <br />hopping in your book, you will love this.  If you don't like <br />a lot of time travel hopping or just don't like time travel, <br />avoid this book. <br /> <br />Otherwise, enjoy this beautiful romance on a rainy day.  It's the perfect rainy day romance book.	2005-05-21

Rosalind was an interesting character.  I kept thinking she's the oldest sister, not the <br />middle one, the way she took charges of things, but the oldest <br />sister, Helena, is actually in the next book, \\"A Notorious Love\\". <br /> <br />No one can accuse Rosalind of having good taste, when it comes <br />to asthetics.  She dresses gaudy, decorates her home gaudy ... <br />but, she has interesting qualities, such as a love for the <br />theater, and especially anything having to do with the works of <br />William Shakesphere.   <br /> <br />Griffith never thought of himself as a man who would ever be <br />interested in an \\"Amazon\\" woman.  He typically goes for petite, <br />feminine women.  He adores Shakesphere, and can cite quotes with <br />the best of 'em, and that means Rosalind.  Griffith grows not <br />only to love Rosalind for her love of Shakesphere, but her  <br />no-nonsense manner, her oversized body, but most of all, her. <br /> <br />The Swanlea Sisters sagas should be read in order, so you can <br />get a good grasp of what they are about & who the characters are. <br />1.  A Dangerous Love   2.  A Notorious Love   3.  After the Abduction   4.  Dance of Seduction. <br /> <br />So far, I have read the first 2, in order.  They are very good <br />books & well worth the time.	2005-05-21

It had a lot to do with compassion, and <br />I admired it for that. <br /> <br />Helena is a woman with a bad leg, due to polio from childhood. <br />She had just enough gritty determination to rehabilitate herself <br />(along with her sister Rosalind's help), and regained use of her <br />other leg.  However, Helena suffers from insecurity, due to the <br />bum leg.  Once, a suitor rejected her, just because of this  <br />impediment.  She took it to heart, and she spends most of the <br />book trying to loosen up & overcome this obstical, more mental <br />than anything else. <br /> <br />Daniel is a man with a once shady past.  When Helena comes to <br />him for help, he is a bit unsure at first, but when her story <br />of her sister Juliet's abduction unfolds, he can't help but want <br />to help.  Especially, since he has been attracted to Helena for <br />some time now (see \\"A Dangerous Love\\", the first book in the <br />series).   <br /> <br />The two set off on a journey to find Juliet, who suppossedly  <br />has eloped.  It does not take long to uncover that she has not <br />eloped, but actually been kidnapped, not for ransom, but for <br />information about the arrival of a certain ship.  During their <br />journey, Daniel succeeds in breaking down Helena's barriers about <br />her leg.  He tells her what a fool the other suitor was.  She <br />gains self confidence, and the two fall in love. <br /> <br />Over the summer, I will plan to read the next 2 books in the <br />series, After the Abduction, and Dance of Seduction. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a romance book <br />about overcoming obsticles & prejudices.	2005-05-21

I don't think I can adequately describe how I feel about this book. <br />I do not normally care much for a plot that has kids as some of <br />the central charaters, however, in this case, Derek & Lyssa add <br />much to an already stellar read. <br /> <br />I loved everything about this book.  This author has such promise, <br />and I hope I can find she is still writing books under another name, because it would be a shame if this is the only book she has <br />ever wrote. <br /> <br />This book touched me in a way similar to how Cordia Byer's <br />\\"Lady of the Night\\" did.  It was beautiful, sensitive, and <br />well written.  All of the characters came to life; I felt like I <br />was in the book with them.  They felt so real. <br /> <br />It was a mostly serious book, however, the few funny moments it <br />had were hysterical!  When Derek peeks under Galen's covers & <br />declares \\"he doesn't have a stitch on under there!\\", I laughed <br />so hard, I thought I'd break a rib.  Another funny moment, earlier in the book, was when Lyssa took Bryan's hand in an <br />attempt to comfort him, and the guards snickered.  It was cute, <br />tender, & funny.   <br /> <br />It did take much of the book for Anne to see Galen with just <br />his mask, let alone the scene where he finally whips it off & <br />shows her his scarred face.  But it was timed perfectly.  I am <br />telling you, Donna Lee Poff knows how to write! <br /> <br />The only thing that I might have found annoying (and in a remote <br />way at that), was the constant reference from Galen to Anne as <br />his 'wood elf'.  This was similar to Connor constantly calling Rebecca 'wee Becca' in \\"The Runaway Duke\\" by Julie Anne Long <br />(another excellent book, by the way).  I did not let this term <br />of endearment get to me.  I just took it for what it was & let <br />it go at that. <br /> <br />The end is full of shockers, if you have never read a romance, but if you have read romance, and follow the clues carefully, it won't be a shock to your system.  Donna Lee Poff's writing style <br />in regards to mystery reminds me very much of Lynsay Sands writing style.   <br /> <br />I could go on & on (I already have, really), but I can't say <br />enough about this book.  <br /> <br />Donna Lee Poff, if you are out there & reading this, please, <br />please, PLEASE pen at least one more book!  PLEASE!!!  You are <br />such a talent.	2005-05-21

I can't <br />remember anything I didn't like about it.  I thought <br />the scenes with the fans where just hysterically funny. <br />They talk about scenes in Julia Quinn's or Sabrina  <br />Jeffries books as being funny, well, these scenes, are <br />every bit as funny as anything you'll read in either of <br />these ladies' books.	2005-04-29

Her thinking was way ahead of her time, but this <br />really bothered me.  She loved Will enough to marry him as long <br />as he loved her back, but she would not consider having his baby <br />out of wedlock?  Then later in the book, he interprets what he <br />thought she said as her feeling that she was not really pregnant. <br /> <br />Also, I got a bit tired of Will at times, his attitude of  <br />his campaign coming first at all costs, of not having a wife <br />so his campaign would come first in his life, etc.  Even <br />stubborn Charisma got past her attitude of being single forever. <br />It took him till the very last pages of the book to realize, let <br />along admit, he loved the chit.  Oh, brother! <br /> <br />But really, it is a very good book.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give <br />it about a 9.7.  Most definitely good reading.	2005-04-29

But Jon, he was <br />wonderful!  <br /> <br />Now, with that said, here are my thoughts on this book. <br />It had an interesting mix of an Irish family, a Greek <br />cook, an Italian street urchin, a French tutor, and a <br />Norwegien miner.  Sometimes, if there were 2 or more <br />accents used in a scene, it was a bit distracting, but <br />some might say that made the book even more enduring. <br /> <br />The things that bothered me most: <br /> <br />1.  Aglia from the 1st book, Thalia from the 2nd book, and  <br />Phronsy from the 3rd book, were not invited to the Sullivan <br />girls' wedding.  This was a sacrilege from my point of view. <br />These 3 women (Greek godesses) were an intrigal part of each <br />story, and without them, there would have been no stories. <br />Of course, in order to have them standing at the 3 Graces <br />rock formation in their flowing white gowns & flowers in their <br />hair, they couldn't very well have been invited to the wedding, <br />could they?  I would have preferred to see them be invited to <br />the wedding, if it meant sacrificing the flowing gown scene. <br />They earned the right & deserved to be present.  When Will <br />says \\"why would they be here?\\" I wanted to hit that man upside <br />the head with a frying pan ... get a clue, buddy! <br /> <br />2.  At the end of Belle's & Charisma's stories, each of their  <br />3 wishes were revealed: their spoken wish, their unspoken wish, & <br />their heart's wish.  At the end of Grace's book, there is no <br />mention of it, so I can only guess at what I don't know. <br />Grace's spoken wish (we did see this in the 1st book): to be <br />more graceful.  Grace's unspoken wish: for her dad & mom to <br />stop fighting all the time.  Grace's heart's wish: for a husband <br />who felt, like she did, that propriety wasn't for everyone. <br /> <br />On a scale of 1-10, I'd give this book a 8.5 at the very least.	2005-04-29

I thought it was beautifully done. <br /> <br />I thought the Dara Joy story was good, but I found it to be the least touching story, for me.  I guess I like my Christmas romances to have children somewhere within the book, and this particular story didn't, although it did have a cute puppy. <br /> <br />The Sandra Hill story was different.  I would not have thought of having a halfway house as part of the backdrop for a Christmas story, although I'm not sure why I think that way, because each year at Christmas, we are urged to give to halfway homes.  The sex was a little kinky in this short story, something different from the norm. <br /> <br />Now, the Victoria Alexander story.  This was a very good story, an interesting choice for this particular compilation, I thought, <br />because it is a story that could have fit into other compilations as well.  This one could fit in a time-travel book, a time-travel  <br />Christmas book, or a book about 1940's romance, such as Strangers   <br />in the Night (I am currently reading this one).  Instead, Love Spell decided to put it into this particular book, which is okay, but I'm not sure it is the best fit.  That said, I enjoyed her story very much, having to do with 2nd chances.  It is my first Victoria Alexander book, and I will look forward to reading more of her books in the future.	2005-04-18

It was the first of 3 Lynsay Sands books I have read so far, and of those 3, it is my 2nd favorite.  I will review the other 2 shortly. <br /> <br />This book had a cute & charming premise, and I loved the way the <br />main character was always landing herself in predicaments that were  <br />difficult for her to get out of.  I got the distinct impression that he really did have a thing for libraries, although there is  <br />an interesting carriage scene at the end of the book >wink, wink, nudge, nudge&lt; <br /> <br />I don't know if Lynsay has any other regencies, but if not, she <br />should most definitely attempt a few more.  I like how she throws some mystery in to each of her books I have read.  She seems to balance humor, mystery, love, romance, villany, etc. very well.	2005-04-18

I do think another Julia Quinn is about <br />to be born, and I see this author eventually leaving Warner to go <br />to the cream of the crop, Avon. <br /> <br />I guess the reason I adored the main characters so well is that, <br />to a degree, they reminded me of my own first romance, when I was 17 & <br />the fellow in my life at that time was 29.  So, this book has a  certain bit of sentimentality to me because of my own experience. <br /> <br />My own story aside (hey, maybe I should write romance?  Maybe not, I didn't marry that guy, I married another instead), this was a wonderful book.  The author has a way of painting a vivid <br />picture of the characters, their surroundings, their story, without bogging it down. <br /> <br />One of my favorite charcters was Rebecca's father.  He was so <br />great, I just wanted to hug the old guy!  He lost a horse groom, but gained a son-in-law in the end.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-18

They lent a lot to the story, and I wish they had <br />their own stories (I'll look into it, maybe they do & I just don't <br />know it yet). <br /> <br />I will say that Marigold had a way of getting & keeping Satch's <br />attention, altbough it took him awhile to catch onto the fact that she was a big humanitarian, and he was just a bookwormish <br />kind of guy.   <br /> <br />I thought the epilogue was silly, I didn't think it fit the book. <br />If the epilogue had been written in the spirit the book was written in, I would have gave this review 5 stars.	2005-04-18

This book is PERFECT, or extremely close to it.  I've been reading romances since September of 2004, and this would be in my top 5 so far.   <br /> <br />This book had everything you could possibly want in a romance. <br />It sure did not seem like a first time book for an author, it seemed very well seasoned.   <br /> <br />The cover is beckoning, but don't buy the book on that premise alone.  The characters are all well drawn & even the ones not so <br />loveable have their pluses.   <br /> <br />In addition to liking the main characters, I also liked some of <br />the sideline romances.  Even though Petey & Ann were cute together, my favorite sideline couple had to be Salinas & Louisa. <br />They started out together, for convenience purposes, but found out each was capable of more than they had originally bargained for.   <br /> <br />There isn't much I can say here that other reviewers haven't already said, but I mean it when I say this must be among the <br />greatest romance novels of all time.	2005-04-18

That man is the Brad Pitt of romance cover models, let me tell you!!!  <br /> <br />Anyway, Stefan Schwarze aside, I did enjoy this book very much. <br />The perserverance of the main character was exlempary.  I think he would still be sitting in the rain right now, if not for the <br />event that changed the course of the book.  I must say, Willa got <br />over Hugh being snotty in the wink of any eye.  I would have thought her unhappiness with his attitude would have lasted longer than it did.  I must say she is a very forgiving woman. <br /> <br />I will read another Lynsay Sands book again, but for now, I'm <br />taking a break from them to try out some other authors I think I <br />might be intrigued by.	2005-04-18

No wonder the author never aluded to her 'best friend' as being male or female ... we just assume female ... <br /> <br />Anyway, I did think, like the other reviewer, that she did an awful lot of snooping, however, he could never seem to be honest & upfront with her about anything in regards to his past.  I kept thinking, he will run out of patience with her, and at the end, we see just how badly he did want her to know the truth.   <br /> <br />I liked the whole book, but especially the ending.

I never did figure out, though, who was suppossed <br />to be the wicked one?  Certainly not Sarah, and I didn't even think <br />of Ben as being the one.  Perhaps it was Fairy/Merci?  Probably not, she was so sweet, with wisdom beyond her years.  I actually  <br />didn't see any villans in the book, truth be told.  As for the way <br />the book ended, I felt it was a bit abrupt, because we don't actually get to hear Sarah tell Ben her secret, and because I wanted an actual wedding ceremony & an epilogue of their life with <br />kids & a ranch years later.  Also, the book was a bit of a slow <br />starter, the angst, if you could call it that, didn't start until sometime after the first 50 pages.  All in all, a very good read.	2005-04-18

I generally try to read them in order (for example,  <br />I have read 4 of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series books, in order). <br /> <br />This was a wonderful book, and I thought Christopher Raine was  <br />quite the pirate. Yup, yup, yup.  He was yummy, alright! (And <br />the cover, with Stefan Andreas Schwarze, didn't hurt anything, either!). <br /> <br />Even thought I thought this was a very good book, I wouldn't put it up there with the Julia Quinn's of the world (just yet), but <br />given time, Ms. Ashley may just make it to that status, she is <br />very close right now. <br /> <br />I am wondering why pirate books have a tendency to have pesky brothers as secondary characters?  I tend to want to throttle them.  I know they are great villans & provide lots of much need angst, but sometimes they are too much to bear.  Actually, they <br />aren't villans, but when they pursue their sisters as they do, it really bugs the stuff out of me.  Seems like, if they had love <br />interests that kept them interested, they would not be quite so <br />concerned for their little sister's welfare.  Oh, well!   <br />(Guess I like an old fashioned love triangle over big brother <br />syndrome!).	2005-04-18

The characters were so <br />easy to love.  I thought her refering to the bad guys (until she <br />learns their names at the end of the book) was darling - Slim, <br />Medium, & Brawny.  I liked how she was a woman who went after what <br />she wanted, she didn't just sit back & wait for him to come to her. <br />Being mistaken for Sinful Sinclair definitely had its advantages! <br />I was kind of surprised, though, that at the end of the book, Sinful's sister just basically threw her hands up in the air & said, oh well!  Guess my sister is stuck somewhere else.  At least it appears she is happy.  I loved the relationship between <br />the main characters.  They were perfect for each other, even if <br />she wasn't so sure for most of the book (typical heroine).	2005-04-18

It was shocking who the real culprit was, right under our <br />noses all along.  <br /> <br />Once the characters got past the gross parts (approx the first half of the book is gross things happening to the characters), the love scenes were just awesome.  Of her 3 books I've read so far, I liked the love scenes in this book the best. <br /> <br />I was super happy for the main characters, two people never deserved each other so much as they did.

This is the only book so far that I've reviewed, that I did not <br />finish. <br /> <br />I could not get into this book.  Maybe it is because my reading interests are more simplistic, but the 2nd story with his first <br />mate threatened to overwhelm the book.   <br /> <br />Also, I did not see where the people on board the ship did all that much to change her, it seemed to me like she did a lot of the changing herself, and much of that came from her new environment, onboard a seagoing vessel. <br /> <br />I read approx. 1/2 of the book, give or take a few pages.  I did <br />want to find out the reaction of the snotty boy back home, when she comes back to London society, but not bad enough to spend a few more hours reading the rest of the book to find out. <br /> <br />After having read the back of the book \\"Lady Pirate\\" by Lynsay Sands, it sounds more like a book I would enjoy.  I have read 3 of her books and all 3 were very good to excellent.  The plot <br />described on the back of her book sounds very much like the plot on the back of this one, but since I didn't like this one, Lynsay's book will most likely deliver.	2005-04-18

It was just as <br />much a page turner as The Duke & I was.  When Benedict looks for <br />Sophie for almost a year, then finally gives up the search (but never the longing), I cried.  But when he rescues her later, not <br />knowing it is his long lost masqurade queen, I felt hope.  It takes a long time, and an accident in the children's nursery, but he does eventually learn the truth.  The jail scene, near the end of the book, was one of my very favorites in the book.  I also liked \\"My Cottage\\" and the scenes that were in conjunction with it.	2005-04-18
US	37164179	R11UYBHYCEND4N	0505525887	812296081	Bushwhacked Groom	Books	5	1	3	N	N	I liked this book almost as well as it's prequel	This book was very funny & most enjoyable, I liked it almost but not quite as much as the first one. <br /> <br />Lucky & Molly were really good, but the couple I truly enjoyed in this book was Cory & Ida May.  Cory was very much like his mom, the main character in the other book, studious, gracious, curteous, etc.  Ida May was slightly overweight & shy, a bookworm, perfect for Cory.  Her sisters were perfect for Cory's brothers, just as the Hicks & Hollers girls were perfect for the Reklaw boys in the first book.   <br /> <br />I was happy to have a healthy dose of Grandma in this book.  She is one of the best characters in either of the books, definitely the spunkiest.  Have broom will travel should be her motto.   <br /> <br />Favorite scenes:  Molly being caught smoking by both her father & her husband (who reminded her it is not advisable to smoke near hay); the fiasco after the Wild Wild West show; the identity of the 5 bandits being revealed.   <br /> <br />I will read yet another Eugenina Reily book, but I need a break from time travel for awhile, so I'll probably read someone else's <br />book next, just for a change of pace.  Make no mistake -- Eugenia is one of my very favorite authors, so far!  Looking forward to your next book, Ms. Riley! <br /> <br />Just one more thing -- no Peaches Hicks in this book??? Never found out what became of her!	2005-01-26

I am finding out that from reading the first 15 or  so pages in a book, that if I manage to laugh outloud and proclaim  \\"I know I'm going to LOVE this book!!!\\" to whomever will listen, then it will be a winner.  And it was.    I loved everything about the book.  One of my favorite things about  the book was the secondary couple, in addition to the primary couple.  I am talking about Billy & Dumpling.  They were two very  strongly willed people who overcame other peoples hurtful comments in regards to her weight, to truimph in happiness.     Ma was great -- but so were the Reklaw brothers -- the book   wouldn't have been the same without her keeping them in line,  whether it be by way of her broom, her rolling pin, or her way of  convincing them to stay in line by way of threats she had every intention of carrying out, if they didn't behave.     Cole & Jessica, the primary couple, were wonderful!  He (and his  brothers) was/were stubborn & set in his/their ways, and she, coming from the future, knew what she wanted and of course, what she wanted was love, but also respect not just from Cole & his family, but also from the community of Mariposa.  She wouldn't concede to marrying him unless he told her he loved her AND reformed his outlaw ways.  Dumpling, by contrast, was also very strong willed, but did not need a declaration of love from Billy to know she wanted to marry him.  (I don't think that declarations of love were so important in the past, I think that evidence of love through actions was much more important than the three little words).      I debated about whether or not to read this book and its sequel,  The Bushwacked Groom, in order.  I finally decided to read them  in order, but I nearly didn't because I thought it might be fun to read them out of order, just to be different.  Often, movies are made that way, where the prequel comes later.  Maybe I'll read another duo of books out of order sometime, to see what I think.    I highly recommed this book for its time travel, for the western flavor, and for just the all-around fun of it!  I'm going to start reading the sequel tomorrow.      One more thing -- Time Travel is to Eugenia Riley as Regency is  to Julia Quinn.  Think of Eugenia Riley as the Time Travel Queen!!! :)	2005-01-24

I think this <br />is only the 2nd romance I've read that made me cry.  The part in <br />the book I am referring to is any part where Richard & Misty are <br />involved.  The Katharina & Kane story was beautiful, but I was also <br />captivated by Richard & Misty and John & Sidney.  I wish there had <br />been more of John & Sidney.  Now, I do remember at least 2 inconsistencies in the book, one where it was said that John was a cousin, then later in the book, it was said that he was their uncle, and a scene where Richard aids Misty in finding the castle, <br />in the evening, but when she enters the library where Katharina & <br />Kane are, it is suddenly the afternoon of the next day.  Go figure.  But I won't let these boo-boo's effect how I feel about <br />the book.  Definitely 5 stars all the way.	2005-01-15

I wish I could have got into the plot - smuggling.  I didn't <br />find that to be very exciting.  I did like the rest of the book, <br />though.  One of my favorite parts was the night of the masquarade <br />ball (which I wish had been longer than it was), where Kit is  <br />kidnapped by Jack and is sitting under a lover's bench, where a couple sits and all the lady can talk about is -- you guessed it -- <br />Captain Jack! Another passage I liked was when Jack bought Kit a riding outfit for their reception ride home.  I also got a kick out of her grandfather, when Jack came right out & told him what was <br />going on.  Jack really didn't have to say anything -- her grandpappy was very perceptive!  I made sure, after reading about <br />3 or 4 books in a row where a redhead was the central character, <br />to find a book about a brunette.	2005-01-15
US	37164179	R2XYGK79JTWEAX	0505521547	464499178	Tempest in Time	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A very balanced, symetrical time-travel read	I loved this book.  My favorite characters were Jeff & Melissa, and  I did not find Jeff to be a wimp.  He was very much male.  He was incredibly protective of Melissa, and the things he said about Fabian really put that guy in his place!  I do think, though, the book should have been called something like \\"Misadventures with Missy\\" or \\"Missy Makes Things Miserable\\".  She was very dominating,  however, both her & Melissa made changes for the better through their personal growth in different time periods.  Missy became less  selfish & Melissa became more self-assured.  One reviewer said this  book had a sad ending, but I didn't find a sad ending.  I think it  ended on a very happy tone.  I had a lot of favorite parts.  One  was when Jeff took Melissa to dinner, only to have the waiter hit on her, not once, but twice ... another was when Missy discovered she loved the taste of cigars & brandy on Fabian's mouth ... another was when  George told Melissa he knew she was not Missy.  I definitely recommend this book and I will read another book by Eugenina Riley again.	2005-01-15
US	37164179	RNF9S5OTICYCI	0505524457	924479709	The Pleasure Master	Books	4	3	6	N	N	I have to give this one 4 1/2 stars because . . .	... the only way I would have given it 5 stars would have been if the author had Neil come into the future with Ian & Kathy.  Neil & Coco need to have their own book. Colin & Mary could be <br />their own book, too.  Peter aka Ganymede reminded me of R2D2 from Star Wars.  Silly as he was, I think the fact that a cellphone, which needs to be recharged regularly, and which certainly can't span 5 centuries, was sillier.  But, without the use of the phone, Neil & Coco could not have conversed.  My favorite scene was not the climatic scene, but the scene where the 'bandits' appeared -- to me, that was the hottest scene in the book.  If this means I liked 'The Pleasure Master' better than Ian, then I am guilty as charged!  I think the quote that Ian & Kathy came into the future with should have been \\"You complete me\\" from <br />Jerry McGuire.  But, as Peter said, he was going to bring them into the future anyway, so the quote really didn't matter.	2004-12-31
US	37164179	RZC54OHIPO6SX	0505520621	968651528	Christmas Angels	Books	4	2	3	N	N	4 & 1/2 stars, Very good reading	I read this around Christmas, and I enjoyed all 4 stories. <br />My favorite was probably the 2nd one, about the couple who <br />adopts 3 kids.  My 2nd favorite would be the 3rd story,  <br />the only contemporary one in the book, where the heroine  <br />gets taken down a few pegs and is a better person for it. <br />I found the 1st & 4th stories to be very similar.  Each <br />had a little girl whos father & mother were no longer among <br />the living, who lives with her aunt (mother's sister), only <br />to have her uncle (father's brother) come along later in order <br />for love to get a foothold.  The main difference between these <br />2 stories is the little girls themselves.  One acted spoiled <br />(but was actually neglected) and the other was a truly sweet <br />person.  All in all, I thought the book was near excellent.	2004-12-30

Wolf is such a macho guy.  I loved the way he was always sitting by the fireplace, in <br />his bathrobe, drinking brandy & smoking cigars ... it was sooo <br />sexy! He enjoyed 'corupting' Red (Molly) and she definitely had her work cut out for her in the love dept.  These characters were <br />so easy to visualize, and it was also easy to imagine their what <br />their voices must sound like.  One of my favorite parts was when <br />Wolf fought his best friend Foster in the boxing ring.  I thought that part was so hilarious!  Foster really asked for it. <br />I liked the humanity of Molly.  She was a very caring person. <br />She did a lot to help people in difficult circumstances.  This <br />was my 2nd Linda Jones book, and I will definitely read more of her books in the future.   <br />	2004-12-30

I would like to have had a  few more pages at the end, though.  It ended a bit abruptly for me, but it was a good ending.  Ignore the cheesy cover -- neither  Eric or Maddlyn look anything like the couple on the cover.  I  rather doubt they had [...] implants back in the 1800's, as   Maddlyn's picture would suggest on the cover.  Eric had a bit of  a hairy chest in the book, but the fellow on the cover has the  typical hair-free look.  Also, Maddlyn (aka Goldilocks) hair was  blonde, not nearly so red as the picture on the cover, and the  clothes she is (almost)wearing on the cover are not the clothes  she wore in the book.  I enjoyed the funny moments in the book,  especially the way Karl & Conrad always kept Eric & Maddlyn at  a safe distance from one another.	2004-12-26

It was a real page turner.  For the most part, it didn't have a lot of funny scenes (except when it finally dawns on Nadine that she isn't in Kansas anymore, just after deciding that everyone was not in on some kind of a joke involving her), but <br />the last line in the book was hysterical!  It ended on such a happy note.  I really liked Faulk, and I realized fairly early on that he truly loved Nadine, though he denied it through to nearly the end.  The book was more of a reincarnation book than a time travel, I thought.  If it had been more of a time travel, it would have been interesting to see the medeval Nadine in our modern times.    <br />I hope to read Sandra Landry's other book, The Wishing Chalice, <br />soon.	2004-12-19

I found some things a little too convenient, such as <br />ailing spouses, but aside from that, I really liked the book & <br />did not want it to end.  It did have a happy ending, and I <br />didn't sob like a baby when it was finished, like I thought I <br />might.	2004-12-09

This book was given to me by a co-worker, another lady who loves <br />a good romance book & who is a huge Julia Quinn fan.  I was  <br />really excited to read it, because I had heard so much about <br />Lady Whistledown.  She was featured in the book, but I fell in <br />love with the characters Simon & Daphne.  Simon sure was stubborn, <br />and I think that added to his appeal & charm.  I was surprised <br />about Daphne's lack of knowledge of sex, but without that key <br />ingredient, there would not have been a 2nd half of the book.  <br />I will definitely read another Julia Quinn book in the future, <br />whether Lady Whistledown is in it or not.	2004-12-09

I think <br />the puppy part was put in to soften him up.  But there was one <br />scene in particular, in the last 1/3 of the book, where he <br />could have stopped something awful from happening to her, but <br />he let it happen anyway, part of his plan, apparently.  <br />I'm giving the book 4 stars, not for the characters, but for <br />the time & research that must have gone into this book.  As <br />for the characters themselves, I would give it 3 to 4 stars, <br />and for Richard, 1/2 a star, maybe.	2004-12-09

There was a lot of comedy in it, provided by the first <br />mate.  Everytime he showed up in the book, I knew I was  <br />probably in for a treat! He was a crusty old sea dog with a  <br />lot of sage advice.  The characters were awesome, my other <br />favorite was Jewel.  She was always willing to help, especially <br />when it came to sword fighting.	2004-12-09

I thought it read like a very <br />good rough draft, not a finished product.  Less than half way <br />through, I put it down for a few days and then came back to it, <br />because I rarely leave a book unfinished and I wanted to give it <br />a fair chance.

George is a wonderful man with <br />a lot of patience & love.  Alizon is a brave & beautiful woman, <br />and just happens to be what George is looking for in a woman in <br />every way.  One of my favorite characters, in a supporting role, <br />was Pippa.  I could just imagine a coming-of-age sequel with her <br />in it!  She truly belongs in this century, not the one she was <br />born it.  Her starburst (punky) hair & onery side prove it. <br />About the cover -- I liked the cover.  Some might call it cheesy, <br />but I thought it represented the book very well, especially  <br />Alizon.  I also like this style of cover, where, when opened out <br />completely, a full, panoramic picture is shown, back-to-front.    <br />I do have to say, though, that the picture of Belch reminds me of <br />a Portland, Oregon Rose Festival Parade float I saw in June.   <br />I'm now ready for my next Lisa Cach book, probably \\"Wish List\\", <br />since it is Christmas time. <br />	2004-12-09
