Live many of Shute's books the feelings he invokes are beautiful and powerful, all coming from rather controlled, unemotional characters. \\"The Rainbow and the Rose\\" is about lives twined and brought around in a full-circle effect. There are no surprises in the plot, but there doesn't need to be. It works even as you know what's coming. There is a great deal of detail on flying and airplanes that may or may not appeal to you--I enjoyed it. Shute writes those sorts of technical details very smoothly so they integrate into the characters' traits. Not Shute's best novel, but decidedly worth reading.	2005-09-07
US	51340707	R3ALOB1345U3PD	1842322753	367900377	An Old Captivity	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Wanted More	I enjoyed every bit of this story, but it wanted more. More of an ending. More of a wrap-around of set-up plot elements. More expansion on some very critical scenes.<br /><br />And yet, the book as is remains vividly and fondly in memory a couple weeks after reading it. The writing is lovely, the main character soundly developed (secondary characters are somewhat shadowy at times), with a lot of excellent and smoothly written detail. But... the thrust of the story came in a bit late and without complete set-up. Elements that were set-up and needed resolution were left undone with some characters left hanging.<br /><br />What was extremely good... the wonderful detail of flying from England to Iceland to Greenland. Beautifully done. The book is worth the price for that alone.	2005-09-07

The author claims to have gotten much of his material from Jesse's wife and mother. They deny they contributed yet apparently did receive royalties. The author writes a good story and quotes many good first-hand sources, though make allowances for hype-driven inaccuracies. It's good reading.	2001-11-25

The introduction reads as a very scholarly, ponderous doctoral thesis (which I think it was). Not knowing what to expect from a Viking saga, wading through this over-written deconstruction was not a promising start. I had visions of the saga itself being much the same--a chore to read rather than a pleasure.<br />  Fortunately I skipped ahead to the actual saga. The translation was bright and crisp, very well done, very readable. The story was excellent. This turned out to be a splendid Viking story that led me into all the others (the Paulson and Magnussen translations are equally good). The Saga of the Jomsvikings was exciting as an adventure story and fascinating as a look at the culture and thought processes of these people at this time (the beheading scene is particularly noteworthy).	2001-04-02

He writes this book about Cole Younger's life in such a way that you feel as though you're sitting around the fire with Homer while he tells the tale. It's very entertaining reading with many good touches of humor and wry comments throughout.<br />  As history...First of all, he doesn't footnote in the traditional way but does include notes about each chapter explaining his sources. It's an informal, rather than scholarly, style. His research was extensive and tended toward finding people who could give him first-hand accounts, or as near to first-hand as possible family stories, along with contemporary newspaper accounts. In this way he hunts down the sources of many of the myths, legends, and rumors surrounding Cole Younger's life and career. Is he right about every particular and conclusion? I don't know. I'd say to read this book hand-in-hand with one of the more recent high-quality works like Marley Brant's &quot;Outlaw Youngers&quot; to compare versions of events.<br />  Croy is very up-front with his opinions, something I appreciated. The author of such a book is the one who did the research, has a feel for the subject even in areas where hard data may be lacking, and I want to hear their opinion on disputed matters. Some history authors won't go out on that limb but Homer Croy has no such problem. He usually is clear on what is his opinion and what he has some evidence on, but he also recreates some scenes and conversations for which there could not possibly be any witnesses. So bear in mind there is an element of fictional novelization to the story.<br />  Don't miss the index--most entertaining index I've ever read.	2001-04-01

It creates more. For one thing, Cole Younger claims that the Northfield robbery, that landed him in prison for 25 years, was his first and _only_ robbery. This makes him either one of the world's most misunderstood innocents, or one of its most blatent liars.<br />  Most authors and historians come down on the 'liar' side of the argument and, bearing in mind Younger was an admitted and convicted criminal, that's not unreasonable. However, I'm inclined to think there's more truth in his tale than is generally acknowledged. Most people just don't lie outright in autobiographies--they hedge and recolor and leave things out to make themselves look better. Reading Cole Younger's book, you can see him doing all these things, as well as avoiding outright statements of his own in favor of quoting other people who had favorable things to say about him, or quoting old statements of innocence he had made. Take the book for what it's worth and make your own judgements.<br />  As to the writing itself... Cole Younger is no writer. The book is uneven and choppy, but parts are quite good. He has some moments of actually inspired prose. He includes the text of a lecture he gave in his later days at the end and it's quite good. Some of his war tales are well-told, but a bit scanty on details. He assumes you know the general stories and is often focusing on quelling lies, myths, and fabrications that had grown up around his story. In many of these cases he's probably being quite honest.<br />  Though dubious history, this book is a valuable and intriguing look at the person and personality behind the historical figure.	2001-03-21

I can't imagine I'll ever reread it, but I'm glad I read it in the first place, and did buy the sequel.<br />  I didn't find it even vaguely humerous, other than in the darkest, most ironic of ways. There were far too many deeply troubled people in the cast of characters for genuine humor to work. As overtly sacriligeous as the book might appear at first appearances (towing God's dead body with an oil tanker), the author actually managed to pull it off in what I thought was a quite respectful manner. And, believe me, that's quite a feat considering the bizarre stuff he had the characters doing.<br />  Even more odd, while reading I couldn't stop trying to work out the dimensions of the deity's corpse, i.e., if the body is five miles long would the belly button in fact be large enough to drive a jeep into.<br />  The story did drag at times, and other than the nifty gimmick suggested by the title, it was hard to see how the plot actually drove the story toward the conclusion, or any conclusion, but it came off okay at the end. One of the things I enjoyed most was the apparently well-researched view of an oil tanker and how it was operated.	2000-12-08

Stephens: His Diary Kept When A Prisoner At Fort Warren, Boston Harbou	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Vice President of the Confederacy	There is an in-print verison of this book though Amazon lists it as not-yet published.<br />  This is the journal of Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederate States of America written immediately after the war. It is wonderful. Stephens is a very peculiar little fellow not at all in the mold of any other Civil War character. He's a very good writer and, in this book, holds back nothing, not even strange little details of his daily hygiene (and I do mean _strange_).<br />  Stephens was lonely, kept totally isolated from all human contact, and so turned to this journal to both entertain himself and to try to explain to himself and others what he thought of the war, the nation, the other participants of the rebellion, and any other thing that came to mind. There's a tension to the writing, too, as he did not at that time know what his fate would be. He fully expected to be executed for his part in the Confederacy, a thought he didn't find as disturbing as being kept in isolated imprisonment the rest of his life. Stephens is in no way a strong, stoic character. He reveals all his fears without sort of self-agrandizement.<br />  Civil war historian or casual history reader will enjoy this look at a somewhat unknown, but important, participant in the American Civil War.	2000-12-08

Without ever being maudling, in a quiet, understated way Shute weaves a beautiful combination of feeling and character.<br />  &quot;In the Wet&quot; takes place in the Australian Outback. One can feel the heat, the dust, then the rain and the mud, as well as vividly seeing and being part of the scenery. The story is that of a Church of England parson well past his prime running a church in a very remote and widespread area. He's a practical man, acknowledging that &quot;wrong isn't always wrong&quot; in the Outback. He encounters a dying man who takes him on a trip through reincarnation, telling the tale of the life the man will live his next time around.<br />  As science fiction the book is severely outdated, yet--I've found this works well with the bomb classics like Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;--if you read it more as alternate history rather than a look to the future (the 'future' is the 1970s in this case) you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful writing, well-rounded characters, and the solidly crafted plot.	2000-12-08

This book by Rose Wilder Lane, daughter of Laura and Almanzo Wilder, is about the enormous price of that free land.<br />  Though Rose clearly draws her source material from the experiences of her parents and grandparents, she tell a far different tale than that of Laura Ingalls Wilder's &quot;Little House&quot; books. I always visualize this story as being that of a young couple living on the far opposite side of town from the Ingalls. One might expect to see Pa, Ma, and Laura in the distance walking down the street, but this is not their story. Many tales you may read about in biographies of Laura are told here in fictionalized form.<br />  &quot;Free Land&quot; is somewhat darker than the Little House books, and is an adult's story (though nothing is terribly inappropriate for younger readers, very young children may not care for it) with some of the harsher aspects of the pioneering life shown more vividly. It is also told from a young adult male's point of view, and so deals often with his struggles to be a responsible provider for a growing family--you can see both Almanzo Wilder and Charles Ingalls in him--while balancing against his desire for freedom and adventure.<br />  Rose and Laura were very different writers and, in reading this book, you'll probably find yourself doubting--as I do--the claims that it was Rose who really wrote the Little House books. Their styles are too different. Rose Wilder Lane is a fine writer in her own right and this book, and her others, are well worth reading.<br />  &quot;Free Land&quot; is a worthy novel in its own right, and as a suppliment to the Little House books it is a fine reading experience.	2000-12-07

The book is  alphabetical listings of death records and obituaries from various Missouri  newspapers. The print is _tiny_ so the book is thin, but there is a huge  amount of information in it. Browsing through is interesting as causes of  death, and methods the person used for suicide, are included. I downchecked  the book a bit for the lack of introductory material explaining exactly how  the book's format relates to the original newspaper listings--how much is  exact quotation? how much is the author/compiler's inserted comments? how  much info was excluded from each listing?--and for the extremely tiny print  size. The listings seem trimmed down to the basics.<br />  For broad  historical research purposes, the price of the book may be worthwhile. For  someone doing genealogical reseach looking for a single person, the price  may be a bit high as you may be able to get the individual listing from  other sources.	2000-09-07

The characters are a fascinating collection, each a  distinctive personality with a wonderful conglomeration of strengths and  weaknesses.

Each  of Heinlein's works is itemized and described, with insights about what  went into its creation. There are many fascinating tidbits of information  you probably wouldn't otherwise know, with inside information provided by  Mrs. Heinlein, among others.<br />  The format is very readable--either  straight-through, or to jump around through the book.

He wrote an autobiography  titled &quot;Frontier Trails&quot; that is a classic of western adventure  about his life as a western lawman. Only, Frank Canton completely left out  a significant part of his life history--his real name was Joe Horner and he  was a convicted bank robber and murderer from Texas who had escaped from  prison.<br />  Alias Frank Canton fills in the blanks Canton left in his  story, and does it very well.

That said, he still comes off as an utterly cold-blooded killer  without conscience or a twinge of remorse. This makes the reading all the  more interesting as he isn't holding back or trying to apologize for, or  justify, the things he did.<br />  The story is very well-written (Hardin was  a lawyer when he wrote it, during the brief time he survived once he was  released from prison). As authentic western adventures go, this is a  top-rate book. Hardin tells of cattledrives, chases by posses, encounters  with the law including Hickok, and shootouts.	2000-05-20

It was a well-chosen ending place to the story as Rose clearly is leaving the child world and entering that of the adult at the end.<br />  The 'Rose' series, overall, makes a nice compliment to the original 'Laura'  series--not as good, mind you, but a decent sequel. The series starts off a  bit slow and uneventfully, but picks up in the later books. I'd recommend  them to young readers who've read the 'Laura' books and want more of the  story. They don't have, and won't give, the same historical sense as the  original series, however, as they lack that element of first-hand flavor  Laura was able to give to an era she actually lived through.<br />  Now the  nit-picking critique...I found myself questioning the portrayal of Rose's  personality in this 8th book. In the previous books she'd been pridefully,  almost arrogantly, confident in her intelligence and educational  achievements. Though she hadn't socialized well with kids her age she had  been bold and out-going in other ways (dating a college man, etc.). Now,  grownup and on her own, Rose is suddenly shy and uncertain, letting herself  be trod upon and looked down upon. And tell me, would a girl who had  managed to learn fluent Latin in less than a year have to look up the  definition of &quot;inhibitions&quot;? Laura, even when she was being a  proper young lady, always held onto her inner rebelliousness--Rose's seems  to have been nearly snuffed out in most of this book.<br />  I also wondered  about her sudden interest in being a housewife. Flirting with the idea of  playing house with Paul could have worked better if it had been clearly  battling inside her with her desire for independence. The entire Paul  relationship was not quite as deftly worked as it could have been. Its  resolution was foreshadowed in a clunky, predictable way. It was  interesting to meet Rose's future husband (and future ex-husband), Gillette  Lane. He was not fully fleshed out as a character, but one could see how he  would both fascinate her with his flash and style and, regrettably, the  traits that could make the relationship fall apart later.<br />  Oddly, San  Francisco didn't come to life in the story. A curious omission was the  cable cars. I never quite felt I could place her within the City even  though several specific places were mentioned (including places where the,  mentioned, street cars would have been cable cars). The atmosphere was  missing.<br />  Something I would have liked to have seen hints of was Rose's  future career as a journalist. Though she wrote many letters (were these  historically authentic? ), the inclination to a writing career didn't come  through.<br />  Though these books were written as children's or young  adult's stories--fiction based on fact-- I would dearly have loved to have  seen an &quot;historical notes&quot; section at the end.e.

Though he  describes other prisons (including San Quinten), it is Alcatraz that breaks  him of his youthful attitudes of rebellion and crime. And that's how  Alcatraz was to him and others--not a place of rehabilitation nor even  pennance, but a place meant to break them and make them harmless, or kill  them. The awful sense of frustration and desperation that must accompany  prison life comes through vividly in his narrative.<br />  The story is told  with honesty. I felt I had a sense of him as a young man, and later as an  older one facing the real, adult world for the first time. Stories of  Alcatraz itself, and its escapes, are well-told from an insider's view,  with only hints of residual anger.	1999-12-04

Of them all, this is my favorite.<br />  The Sagas are  adventure stories, historical novels, and family histories all in one. They  were written approximately 800 years ago about the Nordic world around the  turn of the last millennium. The Magnusson and Paulson translations are  quite good, very readable, but don't expect to find anything resembling a  modern novel.<br />  The Norse Vikings were quiet farmers, talented poets and  artists, politically enlightened people with a democratic government and  strong rights for women...then they'd get drunk and head off for a  fun-filled summer of rape, pillage, and slave-taking. They were cooly  dispassionate about everything, including death for even their gods would  die eventually. Though the saga writers were Christians (Iceland converted  in the year 1000), they present the pagen Norse religion without editorial  comment. They write about it as about everything, in a very unemotional  manner.<br />  The unemotional tone is one that the modern reader will find  most odd yet, as you read more sagas, may begin to appreciate. The sagas  have a clear, bright, unencumbered atmosphere to them. Events are  presented, people live, act, and die and it is left to the reader to decide  how they must have felt. Consider a modern newscast--the reporter will  inevitably ask, &quot;How do you feel about that?&quot; Current style is to  try to delve into feelings and emotions rather than facts and events. The  sagas are the opposite.<br />  Terrific Viking stories in a fascinating world  lost to time.	1999-12-04

When I came to the part I wanted to learn about the previous errors cast doubts over what I was then reading. Even if the rest of the story is flawlessly accurate, I couldn't trust it. Truly a pity as the book is, otherwise, very well done.<br />--since originally writing that, I've done more research on the subject and have gone back to the book... only to find more errors! Some are trivial (but would have been easy enough to get right) and some are significant.	1999-11-21
US	51340707	RQ34LDO9N0Q18	1568330456	52017689	The Outlaw Youngers: A Confederate Brotherhood	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Well-written and researched	The story of the Youngers is very well told in this solid biography. As well as presenting well-researched information, the author writes in an engrossing style. It's good story-telling.<br />One area I found as having room for dispute was her use of Cole Younger's autobiography. She quotes from it extensively while at the same time saying that there's hardly a word of truth in it. I wouldn't go that far. People seldom lie outright in autobiographies--they hedge, leave things out, recolor things to make themselves look better. On the other hand, Cole Younger (an admitted felon) wrote an autobiography that is, at best, clintonian to the extreme, but I think there are far more elements of truth than the author gives credit for. As an example, Cole states flatly that Frank and Jesse James were not at Northfield. He says that two men using the aliases Howard and Woods were there, and he refuses to name their real names. Well, Frank and Jesse were living under the names Woodson and Howard at the time, so while Cole's statement isn't openly truthful, it is not entirely untruthful. In 1903, when he wrote, he was still protecting Frank James from a murder charge in Minnesota. I would have liked the author to give a bit more effort to finding the truth's in Cole's writings than the untruths. But that's a minor downcheck to a fine piece of work.	1999-09-22

However the author doesn't seem to present the information in a way that leads to the the implied conclusions. He gives information on various robberies, implying  they were conducted by the James/Younger gang, but the information doesn't  support the conclusion--I wouldn't convict them based on the info  presented. In fact, I was left leaning far more toward the James' and  Youngers' own statements that they _weren't_ involved in most of these  robberies and were convenient victims of post-war, anti-Quantill  sentiments. Evidence of the James/Youngers' guilt struck me as being rather  shoddy. Sorting out which robberies really could be attributed to whom is  largely left to the reader.<br />Though well worth reading, I would view this  book as a suppliment to other reading and research rather than the sole,  final statement on the events.	1999-09-22

He writes at length, and with great style, of the people and events at the prisons. It's a lively,  interesting read with the stories well told. People come to life in his  writing.  As an information source on these two somewhat overlooked  prisons, it's wonderful.  Some of his racial comments must be taken with  a substantial grain of historical salt, however.	1999-09-04

The story is inconsistant and filled with  random elements (such as the family having no meat--what happened to the  pig they were raising in an earlier chapter?).<br />Much is made of the  &quot;oh, poor us, we're poor and suffering&quot; without the sense of  dignity, pride and self-sufficiency--or outright joy of life-- that fills  the real Little House books. Instead the poverty aspect is hammered in over  and over.<br />The content could have been interesting if it was made clear  that the events were historically documented rather than contrived just to  make a new book series. This book, and those that follow, also suffer from  a basic lack of content--nothing much happens in most of them. Nothing  drives the stories forward. Stagnent.<br />The writing seemed to 'talk down'  to young readers in a way that the original series never did.<br />Disappointing.	1999-07-25

The tone,  feeling, and writing were perfectly on target (though the POV should have  been &quot;Laura&quot; at this point rather than &quot;Mama&quot; because  Rose wasn't there for the scene). Nevertheless, a touchingly beautiful  scene that recaptured the flavor of the original books.	1999-07-25

Jefferson Davis must have been possessed of immense patience and  calm to spend a lifetime with a woman as hyper as Varina. As well as a good  look at the private side of these public people, the letters in the book  contain amazing historical tidbits, such as the prophetic words spoken to  Davis by President Taylor on his deathbed, and Davis's true feelings on  being elected president of the doomed Confederacy.	1999-07-24
