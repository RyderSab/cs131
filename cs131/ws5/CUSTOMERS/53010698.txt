Given that there are over 3000 reviews of this book as I type this, I had to read the 1 Star reviews to see what people had problems with in regards to Phoenix.<br />Ok lets cover what I feel were positives about the book:<br />1. Harry grows up.  What do people expect that he will be the naive 11 year old of Sorcerer's Stone forever?  Harry delves into emotions he has never experienced before.  Harry pops off and shares his emotions (he's always done that, it's just before now they've mostly been happy ones).  Guess what 15 year olds are moody, dont know how to handle emotions well and some times make bad choices.  Harry is a normal teen (wizard), even if he is special.<BR>2. JK makes 870 pages fly by.  There is no doubt that it is long; however, I am equally confident that in some ways the book is too short.  My one complaint is that she failed on some of the details that we have come to love (like the House Cup, Dumbledore's end of term speech, etc).  Sure you could have cut out some parts and sure she could have expanded others, but the bottom line is the story is still great and JK had a lot of explaining to do and she did it.  Basically she wrapped up most of the questions asked in the first four books, even if she left the \\"little details\\" of book 5 unfinished.<BR>3. Book 5 is all about answering questions.  It is almost as if the first three books detailed the life of wizards with a weak and non-\\"alive\\" Voldemort and book four and five deal with a \\"live\\" Voldemort and the damage he is capable of inflicting.  This means six and seven must be about the conclusion and the completion of the prophecy.  Not quite three trilogies (shout out to star wars fans) but close enough and more than enough books to sufficiently cover the subject.<BR>4. The character to die was in fact the most likely character to do.  His sense of bravado, ego, and love for Harry were all mixed into his recklessness and risk taking which lead to his death.  Could the scene have been written better, probably, but in the end, JK did just fine and I will cut her some slack on this one because killing him was hard.<BR>5.  We learn more about the future.  O.W.L.s and possible careers are discussed even though we full well know what Harrys future career will be (if he survives I assume), however there are many sociological facts and features in the book as well which give us a closer look to this special community.<br />I mentioned earlier my only negative and I did catch one error, Hermoine and Harry have their wands confiscated by Malfoy before they march in the forest, yet they have them in the Ministry and JK never explains how they got them back.  Hmm.<br />I loved this book and look forward to re-reading it soon.  Its worth its price in gold because it will be read again by my kids someday, as a part of the one of the most fantastic tales ever.	2003-07-10

Given that his most recent book &quot;The Punch&quot; was released recently, I figured Feinstein hastily put this book together to cash in the upsurge in interest in golf.  I WAS WRONG and am happy to admit it.<br />The author once again takes us on the &quot;inside&quot; and proffers the reader another dose of history, tradition, and day to day banter of those who help stage the world's greatest (and most democratic) championship.  Feinstein grabs the reader with his poignant insights and an introduction to the jargon of those in the know (How many people will be correcting their foursomes on pin placements vs. hole locations?).<br />The 2002 Open was truly a special and spectacular event held so close to New York during an historical time and truly an Open for the people.  Feinstein does justice with this well written and easy to read tome.  In fact I found myself wanting more.<br />I noticed in the thank you portion at the end of the book that he thanks dozens of golfers, but did not mention the 2002 Champion, Tiger Woods.  I really thought there might have been more on Tiger, but maybe John has been frozen out of the inner circle due to his book &quot;The First Coming: Tiger Woods: Master or Martyr&quot;  Feinstein has alienated subjects in the past (right Bob Knight), but sometimes showcasing the &quot;inside&quot; leads to people reading unflattering things about themselves they wish to hide. It's the author who has to live with himself with those relationships; however once again I found myself enraptured in great sports book by Feinstein.  <br />Write on John!	2003-06-25

Not since The Firm had I torn through a Grisham book like I did with KOT and yet I finished feeling unsatisfied.  There is no doubt that J.G. is the King of page turning action; however, one small plot twist at the end does not keep this book from being predictable.  <br />Would I have been excited about King of Torts as I was about The Firm, Pelican Brief or A Time to Kill if I had read this first, I think I would have.  We have been spoiled by the freshness of his earlier books and let's be honest, his latest works have been of the same quality yet are no longer fresh.  It's tough for Grisham to surprise us anymore because of the number of books he has written and how he has trained his readers to truly expect the \\"unbelievable,\\" the \\"unexpected,\\" and the customary trip to the Caribbean-do you think he has to travel there for background information all the time, must be nice!<br />Is it just me or is Grisham just a little more didactic in this tome than in his previous works?  I think he did an excellent job with the main character and you could see the greed and ethical conflict boiling below the surface (like father, like son) as J. Clay Carter II decided to plunge into the depths of mass tort law.  Grisham does paint a vivid picture of the slide from \\"doing good\\" to \\"doing well\\" and character development has always been this author's strength.<br />In the end, this book is worth 4 or 5 hours of your time and even though you know where the book is going, you don't mind it when you know it is Grisham taking you there.	2003-06-13

McDonnell writes in an easy to read manner and offers succint reviews at the end of each chapter.<br />While the author is often the &quot;hero&quot; of many of the insightful real life situations the reader does not get the sense that the author is just patting himself on the back, in fact McDonnell points out the occassions where his successors came in and applied the same 6 Step principles to correct his errors.<br />If you are looking for a book with myriad nuggets you can put into practice on a daily basis this book is for you.

Conant offers an excellent portrayal of this dynamic and seemingly brillant man who excelled in every endeavor he undertook.  From law to financing a significant portion of the utility industry to almost every area of physics, Loomis combined his passion, his efforts, his money and his contacts to work at the highest levels.<br />I was constantly amazed at how he juggled all of his demands, but kept asking why had I not heard of him before?  Ulitimately it is because Loomis sought not the limelight for himself, but for the creation of new and better inventions that would serve others.  Yes he has an oversized ego, but he was more concerned with creating products than receiving credit.<br />My one fault is that the book seemed slow in pace, yet it was still exciting.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in science, technology and even WWII.<br />Thank you Ms. Conant.	2002-11-19

This is Roberts first effort in the Milan Jacovich series.  I fortunately read his latest effort (The Dutch) first and then had to backtrack and read the first effort.  Most of the plot seemed straight out of a TV special, but the richness of the characters, the setting and the all around likability of Jacovich made this a fast, fun read.<br />You can expect that I will read the rest of the series!	2002-05-30

Maybe it is  product of having less knowledge about the Mexican-American War than that of the war fought just 12 years later, but Shaara shares great insight to the workings of the Civil War's great generals and gods.<br />This style of writing (changing the view from main character to main character) has become very popular in recent works (Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire etc.)and it really engages the reader and adds depth to the story.<br />If you enjoy historical fiction, what to learn more about the Civil War's great heroes, or what to learn more about the march to the \\"Halls of Montezuma,\\" read this book. I am glad I did.	2002-05-30

If you have liked everything else he has written you will probably enjoy this; however, it must be said that this book seems tired.  Nothing new, nothing that really grabs you and say this is the man who started the run on legal thrillers.<br />I miss the depth of character from books like A Time to Kill, the surprise per page of The Firm and the audacity of The Runaway Jury, and yet this book is not bad.  People warned me of an ending that would leave me disappointed.  I found it predictable, but less unrealistic than many earlier books and it's nice to not end on a tropical island.<br />Like other Grisham books, this reads well on an airplane or at the beach.	2002-05-30

I found myself asking lots of questions of who I thought Christ was--and found Girzone answering them in a way I never expected.  Shedding light on Christ's humanity and well as his divinity by shedding insight to his story, as found in the Gospel, Girzone creates a vivid picture of a truely caring man who relished his role as counselor, teacher, healer, friend and savior.<br />If you want to know Jesus better and more personally, read this book. Have a Bible near by, you may wish to look up stories as Girzone mentions them. I know it was worth my time and effort and I highly recommend this book.	2002-03-05

The pace starts off slow and builds to a dramatic climax where I found myself racing to the end.  I read this in two sittings.  It's a book you won't want to put down.<br />The only thing that keeps this book from perfect is the same malady that plagues most thrillers and that is all the anti-climatic mish mash that detracts from the story being told.  <br />Meltzer does a decent job of developing the main characters; however, he could have added a bit more on some of the secondary characters as we hardly get to know Conrad and Guff (just enough to want to know more).  It was easy to picture Sara and Jared<br />I look forward to reading his next book, First Counsel.  If you love fast paced legal thrillers (with less emphasis on the law and more on action) then you will love this book.	2002-03-05

Let there be no bones about it however that Perrotta almost cheats us out of the best part of the book by wrapping things up a bit too quick at the end.  Some other reviewers mention this fault as well, but two days after finishing it, I have come to realize that I feel better about the ending now.<br />Our hero, if he can be called that, is living a life straddling two drastically different worlds, one where he wears and apron and another where he wears the gown of academia.  This dichotomy is further explored in his work study job in the dining hall cleaning dishes where he is able to interact with townies and with whom is probably has as much in common as he does with his Ivy League cohort.  How he manages to do this, with friends who clearly do not even see a fence, captures the optimism and work ethic of the working class and flies in the face of entitled aristocrats.<br />Constantly torn between the two sides in his personal life, social life, and intellectual life, Danny somehow manages to get by and to some degree excels is handling the struggles he faces.  In fact I'd argue that he learns one of college's most valuable lessons: How you handle your failures is more important than if you fail.  He makes decisions and then comes to find that his actions are not necessary.  He pauses for reflection and the author does an excellent job of including silence, tough to do in literature, to show the deliberations in his head.  Danny is a character you empathize with, yet don't envy, you root for him, but still expect him to earn his just deserts.  We all probably know someone like him and while he's not our best friend, he's still someone we hung out with in college.<br />Ultimately this book achieves its goal of providing humor and self-awareness without being too didactic.  I'm glad I read this book.	2002-01-24

On the one hand with no previous knowledge, Milan Jacovich is a fresh character, fairly well developed in this book, exciting and complex.  However reading the other reviews it seems that reading his earlier books would be the prudent thing to do to really know our hero.  As a stand alone this book is certainly a strong piece, but once I read his other works, I may change my mind.<br />This was a quick read for me (one day), but a very good one as well.  Being familiar with Cleveland and her landmarks adds greatly to this book, but the thrilling nature of the story should grasp you even if you've never been to the Rock and Roll City.  It turns out to be a bit more kinky than I was expecting, but then surprises are usually just that!<br />Two minor problems I had with the book had to do with Roberts overuse of the word &quot;bucolic&quot; and the ending.  I counted his use of the word 3 times and lets be honest here, it's a great word, but when overused, as it is here, it loses its flavor.  Secondly, the  ending comes too fast and leaves a few things dangling.  I don't want to ruin any of the plot; however he could have tidied up a few of the &quot;relationship&quot; strings.<br />I've heard that this will be the last Cleveland based book (something about his publisher or agent saying he's worn out Cleveland).  I hope this is not the case and I really look forward to reading his other works.<br />This is a solid effort and well worth you time if you like thrillers.	2002-01-24

This is the best book I have read in five years.  Only A River Runs Through It and A Prayer for Owen Meany surpass the greatness of this exceptional piece of literature.<br />Pressfield does a more than admirable job with presenting the Battle of Thermopylae.  Much like Shaara's Killer Angels, this novel puts you in the action, in a warfare so unlike anything we have ever known that it may take you a while to read through the battle scenes.  You can almost feel the charge of the enemy as you brace behind your oak and bronze shield, with a lance or spear in your hand, complete with lizard sticker.<br />I agree with other reviewers that when you take this book to a deeper level the story becomes more base (simple agrarians versus cultural modernists), but this does not diminish in any way Pressfield's powerful words.  In fact, it's the base message that probably best appeals to me.  Are the Spartans fighting for democracy?  Not necessarily as we know it, but you almost sense these fierce warriors embody true patriotism and an ethos of discipline and honor greater than anything known to man since.<br />Is it page turning-yes, is it detailed-yes, is it humorous at times-yes, is it true to the battle-yes, does it take liberties with Spartan society-well ok so it's not prefect, but this book will thrill you, educate you and touch your humanity.<br />Bravo Mr. Pressfield.<br />You will not regret buying and reading this book.	2002-01-18

Both books offer interesting glimpses at today's college students (although most of the data in Hope and Fear is from 1995 and prior), but from different perspectives.  Light focuses on personal narratives and Levine and Cureton more on compiled statistics. Both are well written and insightful.<br />This book also compares well with Millennials Rising by Strauss and Howe, which details more generational mores and trends than just college happenings.<br />The best chapter of this book is the last with the summary suggestions.  So often authors point out faults, problems and weak areas, but Levine and Cureton put forth a very proactive, innovative and interdisciplinary plan for the necessary curriculum and pedagogical revolution.  <br />I recommend reading the last chapter separately, otherwise it loses some of its appeal and clarity.  I found myself re-reading the last chapter and even taking notes!<br />This book earned four stars instead of five because much more could have been written in regards to the summary suggestions.  The early chapters are but supporting facts to what could/should have been a lengthier tome on college curricula and teaching styles.<br />Still this is a very worthwhile read and a helpful look inside college life, both in and out of the classroom.	2002-01-02

I am a college admission professional and while I really enjoyed the peak inside the Duke Admission office, the author does not offer real advice for the type of people who will most likely buy this book.  3.9+ gpa and 1400 SAT's are great credentials, but what else--what is your hook--how do you stand apart from thousands just like you?<br />I don't envy the challenge of handling 14,000 BWRK (Bright, Well-Rounded Kids) and a goal of selecting maybe 3,000 for admission?  Lots of people who are qualified are not admitted, but you do not need a whole book to learn this.<br />Toor's writing style does suck you in and you do find yourself rooting for the few students who she profiles a bit more indepth.  I for one did not mind her forays outside the admission office as it showed some personality, however the pig stories might have been a bit much.  Her introductions to each chapter show off her excellent writing skills, it is just too bad that her talent is tied up in an overlong newspaper article.<br />If you are thinking about this book because you want a leg up on the competition, you are probably better off reading A for Admission (which Toor takes a swipe at in her introduction) by Michele Hernandez.<br />Bottom line is that there are lots of great colleges out there, some have big time names like Duke, Yale, Stanford etc... While others offer excellent educations in their own right even if their name is Kenyon, Carleton, Albion or Grinnell.  The names might not be as recognizable, but the experience will be just as good if not better.<br />Glad I read this--yes for the inside look, but not much else.	2001-11-26

This is a great book with lots of information about how social epidemics are spread.  If you are in a field where reputation matters and word of mouth can make all the difference, you need to read this book.<br />I was a bit put off by the over long discussion on Seasame Street and Blues Clues, it was almost as if the author was trying to stretch things out to make the book longer.  This is the only complaint I have on this book and what keeps it from getting five stars.<br />The section on the &quot;Law of the Few&quot; is probably the best and offers the best insight, although the &quot;Power of Context&quot; chapters are solid too.<br />There are a number of other exercised included that will lead to ahas, wows and a few chuckles too.  A great read for marketing types and those interested in how fads/trends spread.<br />If you like Harvey Mackay, Harry Beckwith and/or Pat Williams, you will most likely like Gladwell too.	2001-11-26

Maybe it's just me, but the epilogue tied together too many of the loose ends.  Sometimes I like novels to leave you hanging and yet Russo cleans up all of his messes (I suppose most people will appreciate this).  It's almost like he offered that up for the paperback edition because too many people complained about unresolved issues.  It was almost anti-climatic.

Having just read the Game of Life and The Shape of the River which were primarily statistical analyses, the first hand account style was both fresh and easy to comprehend (although some empirical data would have been nice).<br />The chapters on interaction with faculty are problably the most useful for families and prospective students, while the final chapters on diversity are most applicable to colleges themselves.  Of course what other colleges have the ability to shape a diverse class like Harvard?  Some of the ideas presented are great for schools who are 20-30% multi-cultural.<br />Students and families who take the key lessons from this book to heart and utilize it when selecting a college will find an institution that will be value-added and will make a difference in the student's life.	2001-08-12

You'll get to know them too in this inside the lockerroom, season-long report.<br />Feinstein's style is very easy to read and this book would be interesting to people from a sociological perspective in addition to those who are basketball junkies like myself.  Does the NCAA and its member institutions exploit athletes?  Where did the fun go from the game--playing is a privilege and the competition in an of itself, along with a scholarship should be enough.  Feinstein tackles these topics again in his more recent book The Last Amateurs.<br />This is a very worthwhile read and more evenhanded and &quot;fair&quot; to the participants than A Season on the Brink.  In fact Dean Smith would not let the author have the same access as every other coach b/c Feinstein is a Duke alum.  And that is precisely why the Duke-UNC is one of the top 3 college sports rivalries.	2001-06-25

Okay so this book does not always stand up on plausibility, but it is a facinating and fun read.<br />Stuart Woods does a solid job of fleshing out his characters and gives them plenty to work with, using the election process and the inherent drama of a close race.  Maybe a bit too conspiratorial, but that is also one of the reasons the book appealed to me.<br />Not as much sex and overt violence as the Stone Barrington novels, but this is a great book for your airplane trip (or 3 hour delay), lazy sunny day at the beach or a quick escape to the cabin.<br />I love how Woods is able to elicit vocal laughter in otherwise serious novels.	2001-06-19

Maybe it was a bit conspiratorial and unrealistic for me (although the ending seemed eerily similar to what we witnessed last fall, but when I read Woods I expect the book to be over the top.<br />Definitely the kind of book you want to read on a 3 hour flight (so what if you get delayed, stranded or have to circle around) you have an interesting read with a fairy tale ending.<br />Not as much sex, drugs and rock and roll as the Stone Barrington books and this may be why the characters need a bit more fleshing out as the characters are a bit shallow.<br />Is this book going to make my top 10 list?  No way, but was it worth my time, effort and $--you bet.	2001-06-05
US	53010698	R34E3CJ80YERIT	0684847957	933865696	Wait Till Next Year - A Memoir	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A most excellent storyteller.	I have had the wonderful opportunity of hearing her speak in person and if you ever get the chance, go hear her.  This was a fun book for me because my parents are the same age as DKG and while they grew up in small midwestern towns, many of the stories she shares ring very true.  <br />While very different from her presidential books, her easy to read style will allow you the devour this book in only a couple of sittings.  The pictures are a joy as well as the reader is allowed a look back into yesteryear when Catholics, Jews and Protestants lived next door to each other without conflict and without a sense of separation.<br />DKG's ability to weave her storied life around baseball shows her gift for writing and provides an excellent vehicle for the myriad emotions caused by the ups and downs of a 154 game season as well as growing up, the move to the suburbs and the loss of a parent.  How many times do sports reflect life in a good way?  Lately not so often, yet this book reminds us of a different era; before the designated hitter, astroturf and free agency, before a 50% divorce rate, AIDS, and 500 cable tv channels.  It was a simpler time, yet DKG is not afraid to point out the sunken logs that would arise in the following decade.<br />I am sure each reader will find their own favorite story in this book and no doubt many of you will have your heart warmed by this feel good book.  DKG provides a gentle voice and reminds us all that for many folks the 50's were the calm before the storm.	2001-06-05

Despite its length, I loved this book.  But then again I would hope that 13 years in the White House would merit 600+ pages.  The author may romanticize the harmony of the White House by not delving too deeply into the private relationships of both ER and FDR, however she pulls no punches in defining their relationship with each other.<br />What a team they were.  Eleanor as a tireless worker pushing her husband to make a difference in the lives of women, minorities, the poor and immigrants and FDR, the political realist who maybe knows his wife is correct, but uncertain whether the Republican/Southern Democrat coalition will allow him to enact liberal legislation.  ER's almost radical agenda tempered by the realism of FDR's political savvy mixed in with a &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; draws many parallels to the recent Clinton administration and proves again that history is cyclical <br />The Roosevelt marriage was not a conventional one, but in the love and admiration were still a central component to their relationship and in the end, their teamwork/partnership defines this unordinary time.<br />I am certainly happy that I read this book and would read Goodwin again.	2001-02-20

I do liken Meltzer in many ways to Grisham, right down to the unbelievable and disappointing ending.  I would rate the first 80% of the book a 5 star rating, but the last 20% lowers my overall marks.<br />The great build up left the author no place to go.  LIke many people I try to figure out the conspiracy (who's in on it and who's out) and project the outcome---I've been surprised many times and by many authors, but the only surprise this time was the total destructive ending.  Whereas this type of ending worked fine in the Lords of Discipline (Pat Conroy), it utlimately fails in the Tenth Justice.<br />Worth reading?  On a plane or beach yes--otherwise there are better thrillers out there.<br />Will I read more of him?  Sure--I gave Grisham a second shot and A Time to Kill is still his best (if not most wordy work).	2001-02-15

Like most people I first learned of the Civil War via the timeline.  In 1861 South Carolina seceded and them attacked Ft. Sumter, Gettysburg was in  1863 and Appomattox in 1865.  And of course Lee was great, McClellan was  bad and Grant just had more men.<br />The Last Full Measure (as well as  Shaara's previous work and his father's) brings a much more holistic look  to the Civil War--with more than just dates and places. He attempts to  place you inside the conversations between generals, inside the minds of  Lee, Grant, Chamberlain and others.  The result is that the dates and  places have much greater meaning and the horrors of war become much more  real.  <br />Reading this series will teach you that war is more than battles  with guns.  War is battles for supplies--food, ammunition, guns, clothes.   The North was not victorious because they were better fighters as much as  they were better equiped, larger in number and better fed.  The Civil War  was about more than slavery or states rights, it was also a fundamental  difference between an agrarian and budding industrial societies.<br />The last  few chapters drag on to the inevitable end, but I enjoy his writing style  and Shaara does not disapoint.  A great finale to the trilogy.	2000-08-15

The characters are believable and I have little doubt that  they will have staying power.<br />The story takes a very unexpected twist  near the end and it was almost too much of a change for it's own good (this  is my only criticism). <br />Gaus captures the enigma of the Amish without  &quot;selling them out.&quot; Certainly you will learn more about our  technologically challenged neighbors, their culture, language and even  their food and you will walk away from the book asking yourself how you  would survive without email, television and cordless phones.	2000-08-08

I grew up 20 minutes from where most of the story  takes place and I like to read about home. However there is still a good  mystery here.  Even better is the fact that the ending is not entirely  predictable.  Gaus throws in enough twists that you might have to re-read  the last 10 pages just to be sure that you figured it out correctly.<br />The  characters are likable, believable and Gaus works at developing them.  No  one is going to confuse Gaus with Agatha Christie, but this series is  certainly as well written as Grisham.	2000-08-08

There are typical double  crosses and unthinkable acts that our the trademark of J. Patterson.<br />Jews  acting as Nazi's--even this might be a little overboard-but hey not every  book will be a home run for any writer.  It's not like you read JP for the  great literature--if you want a story that will keep you captivated and  guessing this is a solid pick.	2000-06-13

As an afterthought I picked it up four days ago and now have read all but the last story--<br />You will be captivated by how easy these  stories are to read, yet how deep of meaning they carry.  I now know what  books I will be giving to people for the next year.<br />My favorite and the  story I often retell to folks (over the phone even) is &quot;The  Clothesline.&quot;  It's full of chuckles.<br />Simple messages about the  fruit of the spirit that are heart warming and inspirational.  The keen  insights are refreshing and poignant.<br />Keep writing Philip!	2000-06-06

Rockefeller, Sr.	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Very long, but worth it for the detail	When I received this book as a Christmas present I was not sure if it was punishment or truly a gift. Clearly it was the latter.<br />A fresh, even-handed look at the life of Mr. Standard Oil himself with most of the  warts and the accolades presented.<br />One criticism lies in that Chernow  never really presents any damning criticism or analysis for some very  unethical practices.  He leaves that to the reader and while in some cases,  it's appropriate, in others it is not.<br />It's amazing how a person so pious  and truly interested in his faith could never reconcile his religious and  his business lives.  The ethical/morality tale has much modern relevance  and like good history allows us to understand the past so it is not  repeated in the future.<br />In the end I wondered, what will Mr. Softy read  like 50 years from now as the story of Bill Gates is shared.	2000-05-22

How will you impact the lives of others?<br />For anyone who works with groups of people (and especially youth) you will find this book to be a great addition to your library.  I especially enjoyed the worksheets at the  end of each chapter as they were tangible ways of putting theory into  practice.<br />This book is very easy to read, but as with most good books in  this category, take notes or be willing to re-read chapters as there is  almost too much good information.  Most books offer nuggets--this one is a  serious gold rush.<br />The leadership team I work with spent two weeks on  Chapter 3 (A person of influence has Faith in People).  I thought this was  one of the best chapters in any of Maxwell's books and this will become a  permanent part of our leadership program.<br />A great gift for graduating  college students or folks newly elected to positions of leadership.	2000-05-22

Books	4	15	18	N	Y	Interesting look at Jesus through the context of the gospels	Ok I have to admit this book took some time to get into.  And like other reviewers, I think the book could have been pared down as certain points were overworked.  My first reaction was three stars, but in the end  analysis, I stepped it up to four--mostly due to the last few  chapters.<br />However, after I reflected on the book for a week, my overall  impression has improved.  Morrison uses contextual analysis to break down  the &quot;true&quot; story of Jesus, his last week and beyond.  Building  upon the gospel story along with non-canon books, Morrison presents the  case that Jesus must have risen from the dead--as unbelievable that is to  non-Christian believers.<br />I bought this book last year and read it during  lent this year--as appropriate a time as any--it will challenge those who  read the Bible literally without room for debate, but proves to be a  worthwhile read for those looking to enlarge their knowledge of Christ.	2000-05-22

Why?  Well you have to understand this is not a typical novel.  <br />Another  reviewer called it a tapestry, I like that image, but I am going to use the  analogy that the book is more like a puzzle---it doesn't look like much,  until all the pieces are put together.  The underlying plot asks but one  question:  How are we connected?  <br />This is a story of divergent people  who converge and Doctorow's ability to involve significant people of the  time is masterful.<br />It reads quickly and I highly recommend it.	2000-03-15

This book profiles the last year of one class basketball--&quot;as it should be.&quot;<br />Who will win Mr. Basketball--The best player in the  state or the one with the best publicity machine?  Does race matter?   <br />While the writing style is easy to read, it's almost like reading  newspaper accounts and this is the only thing keeping this book from 5  stars.<br />This book reminds me of listening to 1190 AM WOWO and the crazy  call in shows where scores are reported from all over the state with brief  summaries.  You hit all the big games for the top stars for the year. And  of course there still lives the dream of the small school David conquering  the Goliath of New Castle Chrysler etc...<br />Truly a three point basket!	2000-01-11

The chapters are well organized and you will find him easy to read.<br />As someone who works closely with college aged youth this book  offered me tangible lessons to building a productive and successful team.   Using his own experiences as a model, (Pat and his wife have over 20  children adopted and otherwise) you know his principles are tried and true  on his family, let alone with the Orlando Magic.<br />Have a pen ready when  you read this work as you will find yourself taking notes from almost every  page and you will rewarded for your efforts as a team attitude oozes into  your personality. This ranks up there on my list of must reads with books  on leadership by John Maxwell and business by Harvey Mackay.	2000-01-11

It gives the reader a great perspective on what is happening on the other side of the coin.   Mayher does an excellent job of reminding us of the panic and worry that  goes through a young person's head while waiting for the acceptance  letter.<br />Some of the information is more relelvant to the  hyper-competitive East Coast market, but even parents students in the  Midwest, South and West will be able to glean helpful hints from this fine  work.<br />Mayher promotes a very pro-active search (which is the best way to  find the best college for you) and while it is not a glorified  advertisement like Loren Pope's Colleges that Change Lives, it does present  some ideas for what constitutes &quot;quality&quot; in an institution.	1999-07-26

Prior to giving it to him, I read it and was deeply drawn to the story of fathers  and sons--coaches and players.<br />But is some ways this is a morality tale.   Sometimes to get what you want and maybe what you feel you deserve, you  need to bend the rules.  Do we as society like this--no, but in many ways  the reward for success enourages it.  Increasingly more and more of us are  blurring the lines of morality and ethics to reach the top.  Gil and Ben  represent the proverbial bridesmaids who will do a little something extra  to reach for the brass ring and we have to live through their mistakes and  moral lapses.<br />My one concern was the issue of Gil and his father.  The  final act between father and son seemed to be as much about money as about  pain.  Maybe that's reality and is one reason why the happy ending is not  totally happy.<br />Great first book.	1999-07-06

Hey Amazon--spell Harvey's last name correctly--anyone else catch that error?<br />First let me say that I always hate finishing one of the Shark's books--that means I will have to wait a year to read the next one.  His  online site is a good snack, but I love a seven course meal of his best  insights and keys to success.<br />Some of the chapters seemed a bit too  familiar, as in &quot;Haven't I heard this from Harvey before?&quot; but I  love how he can put into perspective almost everything that happens to you  in your professional career.<br />Harvey is not shy about telling you his  mistakes and what he has learned from them.  That's the key, learn  something from your failures as well as your successes.<br />A must read for  any young professional (as is Dig Your Well...)  But like all his  books--take notes and/or dog ear pages or risk forgetting some of the many  nuggets included.  <br />Bravo Harvey, another job well done.	1999-03-15

I enjoyed the book on the whole, but I found myself racing to the end so I could &quot;finish it.&quot;  The book does offer ways in which to live below your means and I agree with other reviewers in their skepticism of  'not spending a penny.&quot;<br />Wealth can be defined in many ways and the  goal of being a millionaire for most is: I want millions and I want to live  like I have millions.  <br />Reading this book changed my view--having a  million dollars is no longer my goal--saving and investing what I can,  while leading a happy life is much more important than saving or spending  all of it.  <br />One last point for parents who are passing along money to  their children--read the second half of the book.  Your children will  reflect your values as they pertain to money--be careful what messages you  send them with your gifts.	1998-12-30

This book, with a ringing endorsement from Harvey Mackay on the cover, is  written in concise paragraphs which are perfect for those who send out a  thought of the day around their office (citing all appropriate sources of  course).  This book was highly recommended to me by marketing pros in the  education field and it did not disappoint.  I found the best information to  be in the last third of the book. Take notes so the nuggets are not lost  amongst the ordinary rocks. All in all a good quick read about the basics  of marketing services.	1998-08-25
