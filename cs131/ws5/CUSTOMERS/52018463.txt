First, the good news: the hardback I bought of this book came with a CD-ROM bound in, which contained a number of goodies:<br />* all 10 previous Honor Harrington book, in various file formats<br />* a cover gallery of the Mattingly covers for the books, which are generally very, very nice to look at<br />* the various star charts and ship schematics that have appeared in the books<br />* the two collections of stories set in the &quot;Honorverse,&quot; by various authors like David Drake and Weber himself<br />* a number of books in various file formats by military scifi authors like John Ringo and David Drake<br />Other good stuff:<br />* the book has a glossary of terms found not just in this book, but in many of the other &quot;Honor&quot; books. It would have been nice if it had been more extensive, but it's a good start. Perhaps we'll eventually get a &quot;Guide to the Honorverse&quot; out of Weber? One can only hope.<br />* Weber doesn't balk at shaking things up amongst his characters and within his setting. I don't know how much foreshadowing Weber actually intended, but I have to admit that I became concerned early in the book that some major characters would die, or that the stellar political landscape would change even more drastically than it did at the end of Ashes of Victory. This is a good thing overall, since it keeps the reader guessing.<br />The book itself is the longest of the Honor Harrington books. Unfortunately, it feels like it.<br />One of the things that bothered me was just how black and white the characters were. The Machiavellian High Ridge government has few redeeming qualities amongst its principle movers and shakers. Not a single thing they do, even the few things that are actually worthwhile (like a scientific project to find a new wormhole juntion), are done for any reason other than sheer lust for power. This has been true of the political &quot;bad guys&quot; in all the Harrington books, and it is blazingly evident in this book especially. I mean, in a society as progressive and as capable of producing nobly-motivated people as the Star Kingdom of Manticore, it seems curious that it oculd be run by such despicable characters.<br />Now, I try to remain aware that this is a book about good guys and bad guys, that in Weber's &quot;Honorverse&quot; the characters are all highly exaggerated in their deeds and words. This is, after all, a space opera, in the best sense of the term. These stories are about Heroes with a capital &quot;H,&quot; jut-jawed and nigh-infallible. Certainly they need appropriate villains, as diametrically opposed to them as possible. It just gets tiresome to read page after page of craven, double-talking politicians discussing how to spin-doctor everything to their advantage.<br />In addition, it seems that almost no one in Weber's &quot;Honorverse&quot; makes a mistake, especially a truly bad one, unless they're a total, spineless incompetent. That is, any given character who is written by Weber to be sympathetic at all is pretty much infallible. There are, to be fair, a few examples in the books, including this one, of &quot;good guys&quot; who do make mistakes, but Weber bends over backwards to make the reader aware that these characters only made such mistakes due to extenuating circumstances. It would be interesting if a good guy occasionally just simply messed up, or made a dumb decision, without an accompanying explanation as to how it really wasn't that character's fault.<br />Conversely, it'd be nice if there was the occasional routinely competent character. That is, someone who actually knows their job, and is neither spectacularly good or devastatingly bad at it.<br />Certainly these are decisions for the author to make, and as a reader, if I dislike his decisions, I can always simply choose not to read the books. Still, I really do love these books. I just have to admit that it's become very predictable; anyone who shows any sign of disagreement with any major protagonist, or who does anything that a major protagonist would not do, will always be shown to have thoroughly screwed up everything they've done, and will be revealed to be a total incompetent.<br />As a reader, I guess I crave antagonists who are both sympathetic or even likable, and who actually do things with which the protagonists disagree, but don't screw everything up. Especially when it comes to the political stuff. However, even when it comes to the space battles, it'd be nice to see a martinet commander who actually is good at being a starship captain, or a nobly-motivated space commander who really isn't very good at what he does. Yeah, I understand that the space opera genre is all about noble, infallible heroes and craven, petty villains, and I love the genre for that, but mixing it up a bit on occasion would provide enough variety to keep boredom from setting in.<br />Speaking of political stuff...I have to admit that I grew restless with what seemed like endless stretches of the book which dealt with High Ridge and his cabinet bickering and plotting. I understand that much of it was laying groundwork for what later resulted in the book, and what will result in later books entirely, but I can't help feeling much of it could have been edited down (like this review, I guess ;) ).<br />Overall, I liked the book. It feels more like a transitioanl piece, which shifts the focus from one area to another, rather than a major landmark in the series. It does open a number of new narrative possibilities, all of them potentially fodder for plenty of new books. Where it fails, in my opinion, is in the overwritten political aspect. My initial inclination is to give it 3 stars, but I'm adding a 4th star for the spectacularly cool CD-ROM found in the hardback edition.<br />I guess what lies ahead will be a SPOILER, so be aware...I think it's interesting that Weber has set up things so that further combat with the Republic of Haven may be necessary, and a conflict with the Solarian League is in the offing.<br />A few things I'd love to see as a reader of these books:<br />* a more extensive glossary<br />* a guide to the &quot;Honorverse&quot; that lists and explains people, places, and things<br />* how about a conflict with spacefaring aliens?rotagonist, or who does anything that a major protagonist would not do, will always be shown to have thoroughly screwed up everything they've done, and will be revealed to be a total incompetent. <br />As a reader, I guess I crave antagonists who are both sympathetic or even likable, and who actually do things with which the protagonists disagree, but don't screw everything up.

This is a truly stupendous product, the largest GM screen ever made for any roleplaying game. It contains the essential charts and tables necessary for the running of a HackMaster game.<br />Multiple panels can be folded up and over, changing what the GM and players see during combat and non-combat encounters. It is also cleverly designed so that the panels do not disrupt what the GM may have behind the screen, such as dice, notes, and minis. Kenzer includes a \\"tour\\" of the screen on their site, which will go a long way to revealing how big and inclusive this thing is: [...]<br />The artwork is by the Fraim brothers, who pretty much define the HackMaster look, and is also a take off on the art for the  original AD&D Dungeon Master screen. A tableau of triumphant adventurers vanquish evil and gather treasure on the panels that normally face the players, but the panels that are revealed when the GM flips the screen into combat mode turn these scenes on their heads, showing the heroes meeting their demise. Fun stuff.<br />Plus, the screen includes the legendary pizza matrix, so players can democratically pick the toppings of the pizza they order for the game session.<br />This screen is, like most GM screens, not entirely essential to play of the game. But any HackMaster GM will almost certainly be delighted by the thing. It's one of the most fun roleplaying products I've bought in years.	2003-11-21

The progression over 20th level is rather sedate.<br />Some of the skills pointed out as being ridiculous actually can be found used in - wouldn't you know it? - epics like that of Cu Chulainn or the Mabinogion or the Kalevala. Such tales from the real world are FILLED with heroes doing things like swimming up waterfalls and any number of other endeavors normally impossible for individuals, like diverting rivers. The book is about EPIC level play, after all. It's meant to evoke the kinds of feats (not in the D&amp;D sense) we find in legend.<br />While the book does approach this level of play, it is remarkably conservative in what is presented. Sure, the epic spells are extremely powerful - but look at the prerequisites and cost! No character is going to be wielding such magic daily, if ever - unless the campaign was already way out of balance before the ELH was published.<br />The spells are good examples of what to do with the new &quot;spell seeds&quot; concept. The skills and feats are logical, and often kind of mundane, extensions of the material in the Player's Handbook. The new epic monsters are amazingly strange, unique, and powerful. Anyone worried about Monty Haulism cropping up with the ELH need only trot out some of these new critters into a campaign - then you'll see why some of the epic level material is needed. Even then, epic-level characters will be hard-pressed to even survive against many of these monsters.<br />I wasn't too keen on the section about the &quot;epic city.&quot; I just wasn't convinced that such a city could exist (I think I saw 29th level, nameless NPC city guards). Plus, I just wasn't too inspired by it. I think that much of this section could have been replaced by more monsters, spells, skills, feats, and other supplemental material.<br />Overall, the ELH is a good addition to D&amp;D, and covers areas of the game I've been waiting to see covered for 20+ years. All the wailing and gnashing of teeth about the book I've seen on the internet has been overblown - as I said above, the ELH, if anything, was underpowered compared to what was expected. And that's better than being overpowered.for 20+ years.

One could make the defeat of Vecna the focus of 2 or 3 campaigns; the 3 adventures that star Vecna (Vecna Lives!, Vecna Reborn, and Die, Vecna, Die!)are certainly not for the faint of heart or low of level. Die, Vecna,  Die! is an epic adventure that falls just a bit short due to the fact it  seems a bit too pre-programmed, leading the adventurers by the nose at  times. It does bring the story arc for Vecna closer to a conclusion, but  relies too heavily on plot contrivances that negate some of what has come  before in the other Vecna adventures, such as the revelation that the Sword  of Kas that we've seen in Vecna Lives! is a replica, not the original, or  that, oh, by the way, there IS a way for the Sword to defeat Vecna. This  module also suffers in comparison to Vecna Lives!, which managed to evoke a  truly terrifying atmosphere. However, this is a fine adventure well worth  checking out.	2000-06-30

An example of the latter is Fedor Ohlt and  company's search for their newly-acquainted comrade, the half-elven ranger  M'Lenda, at the beginning of the book; the reader easily loses track of  just WHEN the elf disappeared and WHY those looking for her ARE looking for  her - in fact, the character Fedor muses upon that very question, seemingly  confused about it himself.  Could this be a dig at the editors by the  author, disgruntled by a lack of time to explore character and motivation,  or instructed to cut the (assumedly) missing exposition?  Whatever the  case, this is, actually, a fun, light read. Too much of the book consists  of the characters traipsing around the forest with little to do, and  characters portrayed as trusting and/or liking each other suddenly drawing  weapons on each other at little or no provocation discernible to the  reader. But, y'know, for all the glitches, any book that has a dwarf  destroy a futuristic battle-tank with an enchanted axe can't be all bad.  This book is a good companion to the boxed AD&amp;D adventure mentioned  above, and is of interest more to RPG'ers than the general public.	2000-04-04

I agree with the previous review; for an old timer like me (started playing D&amp;D back in the 70s) the Giants modules are absolute classics.  However, I felt the new campaign section was weak, adding nothing to the  original modules. That said, the original Giants adventures are phenomenal  for someone unfamiliar with them.  I suggest finding a copy of the old  supermodule Queen of the Spiders that collects the Giants, Descent Into The  Depths Of The Earth, Vault Of The Drow, and Queen Of The Demonweb Pits. It  far better fulfills the promise of the Giants adventures, integrating them  into a very fulfilling campaign.	2000-01-01

I bought the original  modules new, and I was appalled at how lousy this collected edition was. We  RPG players who didn't complain about such trash got what we deserved from  TSR for many years: a flood of junk. Thank God Wizards of the Coast saved  AD&amp;D.	1999-09-11

I love the Ars Magica RPG, but I was always irritated that the wizards generally were or ended up disfigured psychopaths.  TSR has finally jumped into the breach and shows us just how interesting the Good Guys can be.  This is by far the most interesting Wizard supplement ever produced by TSR,  and in many ways surpasses Ars Magica on its own turf.  Compare College of  Wizardry to Ars Magica's Covenants or Order of Hermes supplements; College  holds its own on most points.  Interesting characters, setting, and  background, and it's a &quot;generic&quot; supplement to boot!  In fact,  this is one of the few TSR supplements that I feel could have benefited  from greater length.

I wrote a brief, uninformative review way back in 1999, not long after I first discovered Amazon. It's now 12 years later here in 2011, and I thought that I'd edit my original review of this module with even more hindsight to draw upon.<br /><br />This is a classic AD&D module by Gygax. It features an overland journey through mountains that is, perhaps, as exciting as the main adventure, if not more so. This is my favorite part of the module. The adventurers have the chance of running afoul of everything from stone giants to hobgoblin armies. Gygax populates the mountains with bandit camps and blue dragon lairs, and a lonely gnome enclave staunchly survives amidst all this potential mayhem. This gnomish colony is both a potential base for the player characters, and a link to another adventure, WG4: Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun. In fact, I would recommend that these two adventures be played together, as they create a minicampaign with surprisingly far-reaching potential.<br /><br />The actual Lost Caverns feature a variety of encounters, including some of Gygax's trademark pocket dimensions. The challenges are often whimsical, but many more are dark and deadly. New (at the time it was written) monsters haunt the darkness. The art in this module is rather good. There is a second booklet that contains a number of new monsters, spells, and magic items, many of which are not featured in the adventure. This booklet contains the first glimpses of creatures like Valley Elves, gorgimeras, cooshee, and the demon lords Graz'zt and Fraz-Urb'luu.<br /><br />Overall, this is an underrated module with a lot of potential. It's particularly customizable, especially the outdoor journey, and features quite an array of challenges for player characters. I'd recommend getting WG4 as a companion to it, but it's not necessary.	1999-02-03

The  strength of the game lies in the reverential yet exciting treatment of the  whole milieu. Beautifully illustrated, particularly by Arnie Swekel and  Lisa Free. This belongs in any game library.	1999-02-01

It wasn't long after reading this that I learned Sagan had been ill. When he died, I was literally heartbroken that someone with such aspirations for humankind would never see his beloved species reach the stars. This is the  kind of book to read when your faith in mankind has been tested; it will  renew that faith.	1999-01-31

The Robots Won&quot;	There are very few RPG settings as bleak as this; Twilight:2000 is the first one to leap to mind. But bleak doesn't mean uninteresting. Reign of Steel is, although derived from the Terminator films, one of the most  distinctive game seetings I've ever seen. Humanity fights a last desperate  battle against flat-out extermination. The all-powerful computers have  divided up the world, and see humanity as little more than a nuisance, at  best. This is a great setting for just about any type of game system,  particularly as a side trip for dimension-hopping adventurers. The  highlights are too numerous to list, but for me, the most intriguing things  are: the one &quot;Good Guy&quot; computer on Earth rolling through the  western U.S. in a semi-trailer, the &quot;Good Guy&quot; computer on the  Moon that has to bide its time, and the horrific computer in Mexico that  has scoured the entire region of life, down to microbial level. And, not to  mention the standard sterilization of humans by the machines! BRRRRR!!  Don't look for hope in this one, kids, just hours and hours of  post-apocalyptic fun!	1999-01-30
