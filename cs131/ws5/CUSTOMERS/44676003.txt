From the very beginning, Tess comes alive. Her parents are witless drunks with two many children, and Tess must care for them. When news comes to her idiot of a father that once the Durbeyfields were the D'Ubervilles, a family with a famous past, money and land, her life takes some terrible turns.<br />One of the best things about this book is that it is not happy-go-lucky. When terrible things happen to her, Tess has no where to go. If you want to see what life for women was like, you can easily find out through Tess.<br />The end is very unexpected, and absolutely perfect, and very satisfying as well. I didn't need to know what happened next, I wasn't dying to read a sequel, I was content.<br />For you people who love happy books, that have happy endings, middles, everything- read something by Jane Austen. If you are into reality, check this book out.	2002-06-03

It still gives me chills.<br />I think this is the book I read, anyways.<br />It's about this boy who's mother dies, and his father has to make business trips, so the boy goes to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousins. <br />His cousin, Henry, is about the same age as he is, and Henry is evil.<br />If you can find a copy of this book, you really should try it, but it truly is frightening.	2002-04-30

Surprisingly, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. <BR>Thomas Harris did an ok job of writing this book, but he definitely isn't strong in the details department. If I hadn't seen the movie first I would never have been able to picture the things going on. <BR>For example, when Clarice is photographing the body of the girl, in the book you really can't get a feel for what the woman really looked like, and what Buffalo Bill had done to her. Also, Anthony Hopkin did an amazing job portraying Dr. Lecter ,and without seeing the movie, you can't feel the terror that Clarice felt upon meeting him.<br />Some things are much more interesting in the book, though, and it was helpful to get a feel for who Clarice really was, instead of being such a sweet person as she seems in the movie, she really had a temper. <br />The Silence of the Lambs was definitely a made for movie book, and I am very glad that they did make a movie out of it.<br />Overall, I'd give it three and a half stars, but alas! no such possibility exists.	2002-04-28

I came very close to getting in very deep trouble for bringing this book to school (I'm a freshman in highschool.) the day after I'd bought it. At that point I had barely begun it.<BR>One of my friends decided to look through the book, and came upon a very detail picture of a prostitute with a client. <br />Other than that, this book was very helpful, and it helped me to understand Ancient Egyptian women a little better. It doesn't really need a synopsis, the name does sort of tell you what the book is about. <br />If you are interested in Ancient Egypt, definitely try it, just make sure you don't let any little kids look through it.	2002-04-28

Everyone knows at least some of the plot, so I won't go into that.<br />I found Fellowship of the Ring to be rather dull, except for a few scenes.<br />I found Two Towers to be little better, and by the beginning of the Return of the King I was sick of the whole thing. The biggest problem had to be their change of speech.Did anyone else notice that in the beginning they talked just about the same as one might hear walking down the street, and that by the end of The Return of the King the characters sounded like they were quoting Shakespeare?<br />Also, some times Tolkien had his characters say very strange things, for example:<br />Sam says \\"Ninnyhammer! Noodles! My beautiful rope!\\" something like that, but.. honestly, NINNYHAMMER??<br />And then, before that, when discussing the elven rope, Sam also says \\"the rope is as soft as milk\\" or the like.<br />Anyways, overall, a great book, Tolkien really started off the entire Fantasy genre, but just because he was the first, doesn't mean he's the best. I prefer Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series, but then again, several of Jordan's stuff came from The Lord of the Rings, so.. I just don't know..<br />By the way, I liked the movie better, which almost NEVER happens.	2002-04-28

A little boy-genius who has amazing abilities, and a foe he'd never heard of, and a little girl with artistic talents.<BR>Unfortunately, Koontz did a Terrible job in creating this children in a way that would make them believable. Also, the good guys were FAR too good, and seemed faultess, while the bad guy was, well, bad and stupid. He was, however, almost three dimensional, which a lot of authors have difficulty doing(creating &quot;bad guys&quot; who aren't completely flat).<BR>The end of the &quot;bad guy&quot; was sad, a few hundred pages spent building this character until he seemed practically undefeatable, and one sentence killing him.	2002-03-26

I resisted the temptation, however, when I remembered that it belongs to my library.<br />When I have more time, and more patience, I may try to read this again.

Through years and years of thourough research (I am joking) I have come to discover that there are two kinds of WoT fans;<BR>1. The ones who think The first was the best and each following book steadily worsens<BR>2. The ones who think the first was amazing, but that each book afterwords gets better and better.<BR>I am the latter. If you read this book, and start the second, and find you fit in the former, stop instantly, because there will be no point in you reading further. <br />I read several of the reviews that said Robert Jordan was trying too hard to write a fantasy like Tolkeins. While there are similarities, I disagree. <br />It's a wonderful experience to read a fantasy that doesn't have hundreds of strange and exotic creatures popping up everywhere. There are maybe 5 species in this series that would not be found on &quot;Earth.&quot; This gives the readers an opportunity to more fully understand the characters. <br />The books are long because Jordon felt it was necessary for everyone to become aquainted with the characters, no matter how insignificant they may turn out to be. <br />I'm reading this a second time, and it's unbelievable how much I missed in my first reading, everything makes sense! if you look at the first book, and compare it to the ninth, you see that he has made no slipups, and everything matches up, unlike some uh.. more popular books *cough* *HARRY POTTER* *cough*<br />And for those who want to know when it will end, The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and only the Pattern may determine the outcomes.	2002-03-24

I had no idea what I wanted, because she wouldn't allow me to read anything by Stephen King, and I had no other ideas for something worth reading. My friend suggested Tess of the D'bervilles, and so I took it from the school library.<br />Unfortunately, I started reading it a week before I was supposed, and finished it the next day, and so I must choose another book to read for class.<br />This is an excellent book that makes you think about what women had to go through a few hundred years ago. It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.<br />The ending was excellent, and rather sad.<br />If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book.	2002-03-09

I usually do. I read this book recently for Language Arts, and it started out alright. It was very informative, and explanatory. However, the way she tells the story makes all Japanese out to seem to think practically the same way, and that they all acted the same because they were Japanese. She tries to portray the way Japanese felt about it, while effectively portraying what she must have been thinking when she was 7 years old.<BR>She tried to make the reader feel sorry for her because of the way she thought, which caused her to hold her feelings inside, but it seemed rather hollow to me.<br />It was sort of interesting, and did give me an idea of what the internment camps were like, but I wouldn't read it unless I had to, if I were you.	2002-03-09

I read it for an extra credit assignment in Language Arts, which was to find out why some schools ban the reading of this book. <BR>the Teachers were corrupt, the Vigels were really mean, and everyone else were sheep.. including Jerry until he decided to &quot;stand up&quot; to the vigels. <BR>What was good about the book is that the Hero does infact make very big and very stupid mistakes, proving that he is in fact human. i didnt get the impression that Robert Cormier was trying to Diss Catholisism in this book, it was more... dissing humans in general.	2001-10-02
