I continually find myself turning to it and reading it again and again. There are few pallets that match the constellation of Stephen Tanzer, David Schildknecht, and Joshua Raynolds, and they are all available within these pages. An invaluable tool that will save you costly mistakes and pay for itself in the selection of a single mixed case.<br /><br />Wine geeks frequently cite that this guide is for more easily obtainable bottles, implying a criticism of Robert Parker's phenomenal access to and reviews of obscure releases. In addition, the median price and price range of those wines considered here is less lofty than the Parker world. My own view is that there is a place for both, and that world wine offerings are so bountiful and complex that there is more than enough reason for the serious wine drinker, or the casual fan who wishes to maximize their budget, to read this guide and other leading critics' guides as well.<br /><br />A particular strength is Schildknect's appreciation for German and Austrian wines, and particularly in the case of the latter, the last true wine bargains on the planet. The complexity, fineness, and excellence of both terroire and grape are unmatched in Austrian whites. Couple that with excellent winemakers, then add the coup de graces: fewer corked bottles than white burgundy, and you have no contest. This guide is essential.	2005-10-13

For those using it in a finengineering class, it is best to try to decompose and model each product in small work groups to get the best replication of what an actual work-team is like.<br /><br />This work, however, is showing its age, but that is its largest flaw.<br /><br />This work, coupled with Joshi, Neftci, or Cutherbertson and Nitzche's \\"Quantitative Financial Economics\\" (good for time series analysis emphasis) should be the standard and preferred texts for structured products/financial engineering course(s).<br /><br />There is no need to be suspicious of the common function in academic publishing that the \\"big name\\" (Merton) maps to \\"poor quality.\\" For this is an essential book.<br /><br />Again, age is the flaw, for the \\"cases\\" selected here will be on the simplistic tail of the median structured product distribution offered today. However, such fundamental cases are excellent exercises to prepare for constructiong more complex, multi-dimensional products.<br /><br />In addition, the book is both accessible to \\"poets\\" (i.e. non-technical quants) and stimulating (it won't bore you to tears) for those gifted in math and physics and have intuitive understandings of programming and modeling.<br /><br />This is easily one of the top five books in quant fin (not that this is a very strong field of 'excellent' works, but you take what you can get).	2005-10-10

I'm an American who lives in France, and upon first reading this book I kept saying to myself \\"well, what is groundbreaking about this analysis? That's obvious.\\"<br /><br /> Then it dawned on me: Americans don't have any idea how bad it is here in France.<br /><br />The sclerotic bureaucracy, the quiescent press, the stultifyingly monolithic thinking, the lack of any political difference between the `left' and `right,' the petty jealousy, the cowardice, the arrogance, the indifferent elite, the lack of upward or downward social or economic mobility, the confiscatory taxes, the religious hostility of the elite, the arrested and shattered creativity, and the hollow unspoken recognition that all that remains of their culture is a poor imitation of another, more successful culture that they consider more base, abhor, but embrace in a decadent gargantuan bite anyway. Their elites dream of regulating America away, and have nightmares with each recognition of their own lost opportunities. After all, blue jeans and French fires started here, but were perfected, uuuhhhhhhhhh, ....France would prefer not to say.<br /><br />And the horrible, terrifying, omnipresent Cartesian worldview, believing in a mechanical perfection of man that forbids them ever to admit they were wrong.<br /><br />It is all here for your reading pleasure.	2005-10-07

To say that Watterson has created a visual poetic achievement on the scale of The Odyssey or The Holy Bible is not overstated, for as the appearance of this volume attests, something very significant has been achieved here. And yet, like blowing the seeds of a dandelion, it also is fun.<br /><br />It has been previously noted, but frankly too little has been said, of Watterson's refusal to license the Calvin and Hobbes characters for mass market merchandising. Such costly integrity is unknown in this day and age, and therefore a text such as this merits more critical attention, for Watterson has therefore said more loudly than he ever otherwise could have that he is saying something with his art that is beyond price. He could not sell it in that way, and as he allows in his few writings outside of the comic strip itself, Calvin and Hobbes is a deeply personal creation. Perhaps most of us will never be able to create something ourselves so deeply personal, and so we must pause and attention must be paid to the artist who has, particularly the artist who has at great cost.<br /><br />Fandom has explored the philosophical dimensions of \\"Calvin\\" versus \\"Hobbes\\" in the strip, and this again points to the inexhaustible nature of this classic text, for new dimensions are emerging in online discussions even now. Apart from the artistic integrity of the illustrations, Watterson's narrative is proving to be enduring beyond generations, combining the summit of achievement in two fields. Watterson is, therefore, an American artist simultaneously equal to both Mark Twain and John James Audubon, and from his merits deserves the Nobel Prize for literature. Would that the committee had the vision, this volume would certainly be among the finest ever to be recognized.<br /><br />As I live in France, I currently am among the few in the world to enjoy \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" daily re-runs in \\"The International Herald Tribune.\\" This is always a delight, yet Watterson would weep at the compressed space in which his creation appears. This volume, therefore, corrects what many of us suffered under during \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" print run and displays the strips in their proper originally intended size, with the Sunday features fully colored and breathtaking. For that alone this volume deserves five stars, and the additional collected material on Watterson's battle with comic space editors is always a welcome re-read.<br /><br />Watterson's deceptively simple use of line has influenced a new generation of artists, among notable ones are Aaron McGruder and his current strip  \\"Boondocks\\" and children's illustrator Jeff (Jef) Kaminsky in his \\"Poppy and Ella\\" and other works. For this legacy, Watterson is to be thanked. But for this complete collection and the excellent material assembled here as a permanent library worthy edition, Watterson deserves the highest distinctions both this nation and the world can offer.

His appeal to sentiment and tedious articulation of enlightened English Methodist benevolence rescuing decrepitude and industrial exploitation following the growth of empire only finally found a critic from the likes of George Orwell. His opaque prose and tedious one-note themes echoed and re-echoed from every angle wear you down far after they have become transparent. Most of his works are better experienced as summaries. Yet Our Mutual Friend is Dickens's finest work, and in it he exceeds himself. It deserves a wider audience.<br /><br />As middlebrows embrace \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"Oliver Twist\\" those of us with more mature tastes can turn with comfort to Dickens's final works, the uncompleted fragment \\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\\" and \\"Our Mutual Friend.\\" In MoED, Dickens explores repression and self-repression, and rebellion, with murder as the result. With OMF, Dickens explores some familiar territory, yet a gothic sensibility pervades, and indeed is both unresolved, and resolved, for the theme is death, and towards that inescapable fate Dickens never lets up. This is Dickens's darkest work, and perhaps his most personal, for throughout we glimpse characters struggling with the unanswerable, and also coming to no resolution. Dickens mercifully has no pat answer for this ambiguity, and indeed because of this breakthrough after a lifetime of literary treacle he finally writes something worth reading. Get it today.	2005-10-04

In the singular case of John Kennedy Toole this is simply not possible, for after his death at his own hand something of his spark animated his eccentric and marginally functional mother to ceaselessly seek recognition of his work and get \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" into print. Finally, in an inspired move that has given the world a great gift, she approached the late blessed Walker Percy and the chain of events that has led to public attention to one of the greatest novels ever written was put in motion: the Wheel of Fortuna finally ascended.<br /><br />The authors of \\"Ignatius Rising,\\" the first biography of Toole, Rene Pol Nevils & Deborah George Hardy, therefore, had a difficult choice. To remain true to the discipline of biography, or attempt to mirror the tapestry of existence that Toole both lived and gave expression to in his masterpiece. Sadly, the constraints Nevils and Hardy operated under are all too evident in this important work, for it pulls in both directions and leaves the reader unsatisfied. In addition, the best section is that which details the tension between Toole and his \\"editor\\" Gottlieb. The attention which Hardy and Nevils give undoubtedly reflects some of their own experience with their teacher, for they completed this work as part of their requirements for a course in writing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a work that deserves attention and respect, for Nevils and Hardy have done difficult spade work in uncovering details of Toole's life. For those readers that complain that his life was dull, I assign to the tension Hardy and Nevils felt in sticking with the facts of his life. For the interior life is always more complex than that which is on the surface, for each day the arc of life is actually quite dull: we rise, eat, work, defecate, occasionally copulate, and sleep. That Toole's life had mere routine and a limited life of itinerant academic toil is a fact that cannot be escaped.<br /><br />What is unsatisfying about this work is that Hardy and Nevils need to re-write it: for this is a first draft, obviously completed for an academic assignment. They need to follow the instinct that is tugging at them throughout, which is to fill in the details of the tapestry of Toole's life, which necessitates departure from the strict biographical construct. Additional interviews with those who knew Toole, even slightly, are needed, as well as additional interviews with former students of his mother, with Walker Percy's daughter, with Robert Gottlieb and those who worked with him during the period, and tougher questions need to be asked of him. Such as: did you demand changes in Confederacy because some of the comic characters were Jewish and that offended you? Do you believe it is okay that poor whites, blacks, creoles, and Italians can be painted with a comic brush, but somehow Jews never can be? These are the tough questions that need to be asked, for undoubtedly Gottlieb is aware of Thelma Toole's own anti-Semitism, which perhaps was only born because of his rejection of J. K. Toole's masterwork.<br /><br />There is another chapter absent to the Toole story of publication, and it also is dramatic. Toole wrote one other novel, also excellent, \\"The Neon Bible.\\" Because of the unique inheritance laws of Louisiana, the publication of this novel was delayed by Toole's squabbling heirs on his father and mother's sides. Drama is made of catfights, and this is a story waiting to be told.<br /><br />In summation, this is an excellent but flawed work, but Toole is so inherently interesting that any scrap, or even a bad job, is worth the candle, for his light was so luminous, even after death, that it shines over flaws. We pray the soul of John Kennedy Toole is received into eternal light, and this work helps us offer up that intercession.not be escaped.

For this work is far beyond the \\"Saxon sex\\" yarn of soft-core porn to appeal to the Marge Simpson habitudes of the K-Mart paperback rack. Laura Buchanan (pseudonym of polymath humorist Florence King) deftly constructs a fabulous world and weaves a wonderful story filled with excellent historical detail and famous classical personages. And it is all funny as hell. But Buchanan never breaks character, and so the tale reads on so many multiple levels of excellence of its type, stereotype, and self parody of the genre, that one must read it several times to even begin to appreciate its full dimensions. Highlights include the heroine staying as an unwelcome refuge amidst misogynist Christian ascetics, and the appearance of Hypatia. Hypatia's welcome cameo perhaps is the only unfunny portion of the book, for Buchanan (King) correctly details her horrible death: an historic injustice to knowledge and truth, as well as to the woman Hypatia herself. The work concludes with an allusion to strawberry blonds being the genetic result of a mixture of the Celts and the Saxons, and a ray of hope for the heroine and her hero on the sceptered isle. We know, of course, of the bloody history yet to come. It is sad that we had no further installments from King (Buchanan's) pen, for her own exploration of the romance genre and the history of England would undoubtedly have been delightful. This book is worth searching out and cherishing. By no means should one ever loan it to a friend.	2005-09-19

Edwards's \\"Riemann's Zeta Function,\\" for what little mathematics I have is self taught. Nevertheless, after reading John Derbyshire's gripping \\"Prime Obsession\\" and following the math he used there with ease, I thought to tackle a more challenging book on the subject. A Topologist friend suggested Titchmarsh's \\"The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function,\\" but I soon bogged down. I happily came across Edwards while browsing, and was pleased both with the low price, and the lucid contents.<br /><br />For those who are mathematicians and like their introductions to the most fascinating math problems straight and touching all horizons of inquiry, then experts appear to have converged on Titchmarsh as the volume for the first string. However, Edward's work is also appropriate for experts and hits the highlights of background leading to the Zeta function. But Edward's chief strength is beyond his intended audience, for it is his accessibility for the occasional mathematician. With some patience, and not without some little pain and an occasional side trip to \\"The World of Mathematics\\" or \\"The Encyclopedia of Mathematics,\\" even a self-trained mathematician can appreciate most of what Edwards is explaining.<br /><br />In short, I heartily recommend to those who have enjoyed John Derbyshire's \\"Prime Obsession,\\" and have additional steam, to take up Edward's \\"Riemann' Zeta Function\\" volume for further insights and knowledge.	2005-09-19

Paul Wilmott's two volume \\"Quantitative Finance\\" also has a solid following, in addition to growing appreciation for Mark Joshi's \\"The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance.\\" Robert Kolb's \\"Futures, Options, and Swaps\\" therefore is often confined to an \\"also-ran\\" and treated as unserious because of its inclusion in the CFA curriculum. This is unfair, and for most undergraduate and MBA students who are not destined for derivatives dealing desks, and even many who are, Kolb is the better volume.<br /><br />Critics of Hull frequently cite that he is dry and technical to the point of somnolence. For Wilmott the opposite is the case. Critics hold his tone is flippant and that he glosses over major dimensions. My own view is these harsh reactions to these fine authors are exaggerations, but do have some evidence to support their expression. This, as a professor, leads me to the conclusion that for many students the author's tone is a major factor in their successful engagement with a fundamental teaching text.<br /><br />This leads me to Kolb's excellent works. Many undergraduate and some MBA students of derivatives use \\"Hull lite\\" (\\"Fundamentals of Futures and Options Markets\\"), but I encourage the wider adoption and use of Kolb's \\"Futures, Options, and Swaps.\\" Kolb is superior to Hull for tone, accessibility, lucidity, and utility. Where Hull reaches for a completist coverage of obscure pricing models, Kolb's coverage is instead complete in a practical sense, while not abandoning treatment of less well-known options and their pricing models. Kolb's clarity is commendable, and never dry. Kolb does not gloss over or ignore difficult topics, and his style is never pedantic or superficial.<br /><br />This text does, however, contain any number of horrible errors and editing snafus that frustrate the reader. The errata sheet from the publisher does little to ameliorate the pain from these howlers. One wonders how a book can contain so many errors in such a competitive field. But it is fairly easily explained: because of Kolb's adoption by the CFA curriculum, there is a floor of near guaranteed sales that creates a non-competitive economic rent.<br /><br />I particularly recommend Kolb over Hull and Wilmott for those students whose background is not mathematics, engineering, or hard sciences. While the book is technical, it is not written in near-code geek speak. For my MBA students who are \\"poets\\" rather than \\"rocket scientists\\" Kolb wins as hands down favorite. Hull remains excellent for experts, PhD students, technicians, and pricing specialists, however, Kolb certainly deserves wider respect and use by the majority of students of derivatives. In short, while flawed, Kolb is an excellent and accessible work. I recommend the wide adoption of Kolb's \\"Futures, Options, and Swaps,\\" and in fact, all his other works, for most students of finance.orrible errors and editing snafus that frustrate the reader.

Powers (New York Review Books Classics)	Books	5	30	31	N	Y	America's greatest writer	In a world where bestselling authors Joe Queenan, P.J. O'Rourke, Dave Barry, Christopher Buckley, and (God-forgive-me) Al Franken are hailed as leading humorists, there are three giants of American humor that are criminally underappreciated: Florence King, Jim Goad, and the late James Farl Powers. While King and Goad follow in the Rabelasian tradition of the better known humorists listed above, J.F. Powers wrote in a deep and subtle field of allusion and irony. His humor is poignant and instructive in a way that is both profoundly human, yet open to the face of the divine.<br /><br />The stories collected here also include Powers's tragic pieces, as well as other sketches and thinly disguised passages of his own family life. These are exemplary works, and perhaps the best examples of American writing ever produced, for Powers has often been called \\"the writer's writer\\" for the craft and care with which he chooses words.<br /><br />Attention has been paid to the fact that Powers was a Catholic writer, and there have been critics who strain to invoke comparison with Flannery O'Connor. For me the only points of tangency are that they were Catholics, were writers, wrote about humor and irony, but that is about it. Their voices create entirely different worlds, and their characters are hewn from different rock, and their anima sprouted from different soil.<br /><br />Powers is a distinctly different writer, speaking from a different landscape and with a plainness of style that invokes the Midwest and invites comparison with Willa Cather. But as William Faulkner said and wrote, Powers's subjects are circumscribed by \\"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing.\\"<br /><br />And so we return to Powers's comedy. For his humor is deeply funny both for what is on the page, and for that which is unstated. Indeed, with a single sentence Powers creates paragraphs of detail in the reader's imagination; we have seen each of these people and each of these situations before, oftentimes in the mirror. But Powers is gentle, and gives us a kind of catharsis as we follow the bumbling path of flawed souls, venial, petty, and helpless, but not hopeless.<br /><br />If there is a counterpoint in American letters to which Powers should be compared, then I suggest H.L. Mencken, for in many ways Powers is the answer to Mencken, for all which he found contemptible, Powers has also found funny, but more importantly sacred. Mencken's American cynicism and misanthropy have been answered by Powers with prose that is his match, and a literary redemption of the common soul that could only have been inspired by both a love of man and a love of the written word. Until the Library of America recognizes Powers for the giant of American writing that he is, we will have to be content with this edition. A pity, for the binding is poor, and already sections are falling out of my copy. From heaven, Powers must observe this condition with the wry and ironic amusement to which, during his earthly life, he gave voice.and each of these situations before, oftentimes in the mirror.

So I will focus on the flaws. The last chapters have all the marks of a rushed job, which I suspect is true, as the author, the publisher, and the author's agent, all knew that two other popular works on Riemann's Zeta function were also being written. This is a pity, for every other chapter in Derbyshire's work is a gem of the first water of clarity. Imagine a string of sparkling diamonds, but the last few looking like dirty ice, and the final one a black, uncut, industrial diamond and you get a sense of the abrupt change in writing clarity and editing quality. In addition, the pacing for the majority of the book is just right, alternating the chapters on history and elucidation of the math topics necessary to appreciate large facets of Riemann's Zeta was a stroke of genius, and it works very well. Which again brings me to my disappointment with the last several chapters. One can only hope that Derbyshire is persuaded to issue a second edition, with an update on current work on Zeta, and a reapir job on his disjointed last chapters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I reiterate, this is the finest popular mathematics book ever written and everyone could benefit from reading it.	2005-09-19

Allen's \\"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election,\\" was. The answer is: not very. Other reviewers have noted that Allen has hopelessly muddled thinking on the difference between discipline, doctrine, and dogmas of the Church, and for this flaw alone he deserves zero stars: he has misled and misrepresented the faithful, and has misinformed those outside the Church. Such ignorance is not invincible, and rather more startling, to be clear on these points in this book is a large part of Allen's job. Allen clearly did not do that job.<br /><br />Where Allen is of limited usefulness is his \\"USAToday\\" style of journalism and covering some mechanics and some personalities of a Conclave. His work on explaining the difference between Cardinal Bishops, Cardinal Priests, and Cardinal Deacons, for example, was somewhat helpful. But even his few good paragraphs are thin gruel, and during the last Conclave I found more accurate coverage with better detail in such diverse sources as The American Spectator, The Jerusalem Post, and The Wall Street Journal.<br /><br />Which brings me to my conclusion: this is a sloppy work written with an agenda and an ax to grind, a \\"liberal\\" view from an author who intentionally misrepresented the Conclave as some sort of robed meeting of politicking Mafioso. It was also clearly written to make a fast buck, and smacks of lifted paragraphs from an archived news que of \\"backgrounder\\" pieces.<br /><br />Both Catholics and non-Catholics alike deserve a better treatment of the process and personalities of a Conclave. Allen's isn't it.	2005-09-19

The previous best work was the CBOT's own \\"Commodities Trading Manual,\\" which has been outdated for a decade. Before the arrival of Helyette Geman's \\"Commodities and Commodity Derivatives : Modeling and Pricing for Agriculturals, Metals and Energy\\" the current state-of-the-art for pricing models and information feeds for commodity derivatives was sadly dispersed across journals, often obscure ones. Now increasing attention is being paid to diversified portfolios containing commodity exposure in addition to classic investment vehicles. Along with hedge funds, who naturally seek \\"under priced\\" volatility, portfolio managers today must therefore have a command of a wider knowledge base of investment opportunities. This work is therefore, indispensable.<br /><br />The weakest element of the work is Nassim Taleb's introduction, for which commercial interests and pedagogic considerations no doubt combined.	2005-09-19

Connoly's \\"Buying and Selling Volatility\\" is a useful work for beginning option traders and market makers, especially those coming from other fields. However, one should be strongly cautious on two fronts: 1) the book is now outdated by some years, both in strategies and more sophisticated technological advances (faster and better random number generators, automatic execution, VBA & C++ code, utilities, Excel advances, distributed networks, etc.); and 2) this book only addresses some simple strategies, and senior desks and hedge funds will be light years beyond those described here.<br /><br />Both of these caveats are as one should expect from a book. Think about it, if Connolly had the holy grail of volatility trading, he would not write a book about it, he would be trading options.<br /><br />This book, followed by Baird's superior work \\"Option Market Making\\" should give beginning junior traders and trainees a good foundation in basics, vocabulary, model techniques, etc. However, one should not look at this book as the only answer or a prime reference or authoritative. The chief advantage of BaSV is that it isolates option trading and techniques as a topic. In most other finance books, or even option pricing books, strategy and market making are left to the reader to figure out for themselves. Connolly joins Baird in writing from the perspective of a trader, not an academic. For this perspective alone it may be useful. However, for those with limited budgets, I suggest buying only Baird, and skipping this work.	2005-09-07

Shreve's Methods of Mathematical Finance will be the most accessible for helping you understand what all the fuss is about in finance and Wall Street. From the groves of academe, finance as it is practiced looks like so much \\"nonsense on stilts.\\" However, serious intellectual work has been done examining finance and transactions under limits, spaces, stochastic paths and operators, and this work is the most rigorous explication of the foundations of this thinking, and its most natural extensions and applications.<br /><br />This work is explicitly not for MBAs or other `phynance-lite\\" types who view interest rates as single factor driven and think the alpha and omega of option pricing as the Black-Scholes model. While the work rigorously addresses interest rates and option pricing from a mathematical standpoint, it is better thought of as applying Brownian motion to contingent events and time series, which for the purposes of this volume are financial values and the volatility of outcomes.<br /><br />Another audience will be advanced students studying financial engineering or mathematical finance. This book is foundational required reading in most of the French DEA programs dealing with stochastic applications to finance.<br />One major caution: unless you have an intuitive grasp of programming from reading math presented in the \\"definition-theorem-proof\\" form of academia, you will be at a loss as to how to bridge this work to a practical application. I know of students who floundered around with Mathematica and this volume before coming across more accessible works written for practitioners and programmers in mind. This work is for those well trained in mathematics who want to learn about finance. For learning about programming optimal savings and consumption portfolios, option prices, etc. other works, such as those by Mark Joshi, are your better choice.	2005-09-07

This work features excellent introductory commentary to each tale. Editor Charles A. Coulombe has both intelligence and taste, and his curious selections bare no obvious common thread save one: each author of the stories contained here was not writing merely to thrill, but also to warn. For the arc of each selection is that both the editor and the authors here have a true and healthy respect for the supernatural, and acknowledge there is an evil side to it, and that the evil side is neither friendly nor pretty, but in fact is hell-bound. In addition, unlike Russell Kirk's admirable works in \\"Ancestral Shadows: An Anthology Of Ghostly Tales\\" that ultimately are moral tales, not ghost stories, Coulombe's selections have less predictable endings and allow for ambiguity in whether good triumphs over evil. For simple \\"good\\" does not always triumph over complex evil, rather, the supernatural source of these horrors needs something far more powerful than mere human good to be defeated. And the source of that power is supernatural also, and divine. Coulombe's selections, therefore, frighten us at a much deeper level than the gore and anarchy, or Lovecraft re-stated, that passes for \\"horror\\" today, but like Kirk Coulombe's selections also instruct the orientation of dimensions of our selves. But Coulombe's selections are superior to Kirk's works, and point to a challenging Platonic ultra-realism where the reader remains unsettled and seeks real solace outside the fictional landscape. Only good horror tales can do that, and Coulombe has found them.	2005-09-05

Holden's \\"Excel Modeling in Investments\\" came as an excellent surprise to me when I received a faculty review copy from the publisher. I have long used Simon Benninga's competing text \\"Financial Modeling in Excel\\" to teach undergraduate and graduate financial modeling courses, however, I seriously am considering switching to Holden's EMinI. Holden correctly emphasizes discounting a bond's value on various yield curves, rather than a linear or fixed discount rate as in Benninga. Holden has some flaws, his layouts for binomial pricing models are inefficient for adapting to trinomial converging tree models, for example, but Holden is the only serious rival to Benninga in coverage of the major topics of modeling. Holden covers bonds, duration, convexity, portfolio optimization, financial planning, and the leading option pricing models. In addition, he covers cost of carry in the context of spot and futures prices, and interest rate parity. Holden does not cover Value at Risk, cheapest to deliver bonds, and has little on Visual Basic. However he does cover the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross interest rate models more thoroughly than Benninga. Holden's flaws are many: there is no index, and this is a text that cries out for one. Similarly, the footnotes are inadequate, and a broad \\"Further Reading\\" and bibliography should be here. Holden also suffers from being written as a companion text to popular finance textbooks such as Bodie Kane and Marcus, however, one always has the impression that the author was looking more to maximizing the market share of the text than really selecting the best chapters. We can only hope that Holden follows the better angels of his nature and includes more detail and chapters, perhaps on Monte Carlo simulation, VaR, and VBA programming. The CD-Rom, while helpful, is a little light, but this is the author's intention for he wishes students to build their own models from scratch.<br /><br />In summary, I heartily recommend this book coupled with Benninga's more detailed \\"Financial Modeling in Excel\\" and find the practical emphasis indispensable for those working with or using a theoretical text such as Bodie Kane and Marcus. For those students that want careers in finance, this book is fundamental, primary, and necessary, for it emphasizes practical skills you will be executing everyday at a much higher level in a bank or asset management firm. Master these skills and models now before beginning your career and the acceleration of your promotions responsibilities will exceed those of your peers quickly.oupled with Benninga's more detailed \\"Financial Modeling in Excel\\" and find the practical emphasis indispensable for those working with or using a theoretical text such as Bodie Kane and Marcus.

As I write this in June of 2005, quantitative finance has grown up. What was once a cross-over subfield of finance with a veneer of mathematics is now a field unto itself, and hence, in the past decade there have been an explosion of books which often replicate or restate what has been said before with little new to add. Also, there remains an unforgiving gap between introductory texts that are too superficial and specialists' mathematics books that are rigorous and difficult works beyond the commitment for mastery of the busy, intelligent, practical front-line quant. In addition, works that were once adequate are now simplistic and under serve their readers by lulling them into false confidence. Into this fray Dr. Mark S. Joshi's \\"The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance\\" enters with a modern voice and delivers what previous texts have only promised and failed to. The work lives up to its title by presenting both concepts and practicalities, and makes other works that do neither well obsolete. Those familiar with my other reviews on quantitative finance texts know that I place a premium on clarity, and on this front Joshi deserves six stars, for he is a master of what William Strunk called \\"the plain style.\\" I am always sensitive to the fact that many of the world's best quants come from nations where English is not the first language. Readers from China, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Russia and eastern Europe will enjoy Joshi's clarity and find his English easy to follow. It would be impossible to cover everything in quanfin in a single volume, however there is nothing horribly glossed over here and neither is there a single wasted word or equation.<br /><br />I recommend Amazon review readers refer to the table of contents in the \\"Look Inside\\" feature to see what Joshi covers, but my own highlight is how welcome it is that Joshi focuses on risk from the very first word. Since Louis Bachelier risk measurement is what separates quantitative finance from \\"finance.\\" Other books, including some quantitative finance works, start with cash flows, valuation, and discounting, and only add risk as an antecedent. Joshi correctly emphasizes risk first, last, and always, and for that elevation alone his work deserves five stars. From this foundation Joshi then covers very well pricing methods and arbitrage, simple and high dimensional trees, and the useful shortcuts of Ito calculus that makes tractable Zeno's paradox. Joshi also covers risk neutral and martingale methods, continuous barrier options, multi-look exotic options and incomplete markets and jump processes with an aim of showing these as typical problems for the working quant. Joshi's own references, index, and footnotes testify that by no means is he offering the first, nor the last, word on these knotty subjects, but his treatment is welcome just the same.<br /><br />The target audience who would benefit from this text over others is four-fold. The primary audience is for first semester students in a graduate financial engineering program, for Joshi's \\"Concepts and Practice\\" will be handy throughout his or her studies and career. For those students unsure of their skills and with a limited budget considering between this and an introductory quantitative finance text I recommend Joshi over, say, Wilmott, for this work is more rigorous and in the long run will provide the better value as a practical companion. Within this audience I include professors looking for a high level foundational text for teaching practical risk management and derivatives pricing: this is the book to adopt, yes, even over Hull.<br /><br />The second audience is for those trained in other science fields: pure mathematics, statistics, physics, etc. who are moving to finance jobs. This volume is an easy \\"one-stop shop\\" for you to re-tool your own background towards those topics and techniques used on a quant desk. While by no means covering everything, Joshi speaks your language and after digesting this work all else will fall into place and be understood and used with greater efficiency.<br /><br />The third and broadest audience is one I am a member of: the already trained and practical \\"quant.\\" Why should we need this book? My observation is that between reading (for example) Hull and Wilmott, Joshi's \\"Concepts\\" unavoidably covers many of the same topics, but also some things they do not and in ways they never could. Joshi is an expert practitioner at the top of his art, and that practical spirit is in every single page. For example, while Hull and Wilmott cover the concept and mathematics of stochastic volatility, Joshi writes from the point of view of the coding quant and discusses the issues of implementation. Joshi's \\"Concepts and Practice\\" serves a two fold purpose for a qaunt: it provides an additional voice and explanation of inescapably fundamental material, while bridging the gap of technical deployment for front line practitioners. This is not to say that Joshi offers us up a cookbook, for by no means is this such. Anyone who thinks they can simply buy this book and in a sleepy afternoon plug away code and technique and be done is missing the point: for this is a teaching text. Moreover, each house and set of problems and instruments and structured products to offer are different, to say nothing of the platforms one will be working on. That is why they call it \\"work.\\" Therefore the practical quant should look to this text as a reference guidebook in a tool box.<br /><br />As a fourth audience I cautiously recommend this book for those who are going into exotic product sales, but only those who have a good grounding in upper level calculus, linear and matrix algebra, time series analysis, and trees. Why? Simply put, you will be offering products built by quants who simply assume the knowledge in this book is a given. In addition, your better clients will (or should) have quants speaking this language, and the greater your own understanding of the concerns of your team and your clients the better your sales. If this work is too rigorous, then Wilmott's \\"Introduction to Quantitative Finance\\" quickly followed by Joshi's \\"Concepts and Techniques\\" is the course to follow.<br /><br />Who is this work not for? Here are some tests. If you are a quant who can type at five lines of code a minute and can read Shreve and Karatzas drinking beer, then this work is too redundant for you. On my desk is a paper on a stochastic process with drift and viscosity under regime switching. If you are reading the same journal, then this work is too simple for you. If you have no idea what I've written about in the past three sentences, then this work is too hard for you.<br /><br />In summary, Dr. Mark Joshi advances his excellent reputation as an intelligent, practical, and generous quant in offering \\"The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance\\" and I recommend this book's wide adoption in graduate programs and its addition to reference libraries.esting this work all else will fall into place and be understood and used with greater efficiency. <br />The third and broadest audience is one I am a member of: the already trained and practical \\"quant.\\" Why should we need this book?

US	49164331	RIS2MBVT8HDMO	0743410459	913713005	It Came From Memphis	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An indispensable masterpiece of music history.	Robert Gordon has performed a valuable service to music history in penning \\"It Came From Memphis\\" and correctly amplified attention to names known to cognoscenti but are overshadowed by the overly familiar. Indeed, Gordon could increase his scope for a second and third volume with little trouble. Gordon's focus on the offbeat musical offerings paired with the critically respected Chilton, Dickinson, and Lewis, captures the spirit of Memphis music that emerges in the rich melange of swamp trash culture overlaid with bourgeois convention and its anti-thesis of rebellion. In many ways this is Gordon's point: this music could only have come from Memphis. The casual reader may wonder why this matters, and the simple answer is that between the clean sounds and production values of Los Angeles, Nashville, and New York City,  Memphis's Sun Studios, Stax Records, and Ardent Studios emerged as birthplaces of something that was much more than merely \\"The Memphis Sound.\\" Indeed the Memphis sound could not be circumscribed. Gordon's proper emphasis on the commercially overlooked is also appropriate. For the tragedy of Memphis music is also rooted in its curse: Memphis Music is nearly always damned with commercial failure yet critical success. Today, musicologists speak in reverential tones about Dickinson's work with Ry Cooder, and hold Big Star 3rd and The Scruffs as mortal products that now abide as music for gods; such is the influence of these masterpieces that lack the airplay and exposure of even Elvis's \\"Clambake.\\" Commercial success of Memphis music is a binomial model, either you are elder god like Elvis and W.C. Handy, or you have a number one hit record like \\"The Letter\\" but still end up a flophouse habitude and washing dishes in New Orleans. Yet the influence of these Memphis artists abides and, like the Snopes, they endure. Gordon has brought our attention to Memphis music and corrected the oversight of history with this foundational work, and it merits inclusion in the music reference section of every library. We owe Gordon our thanks.the music reference section of every library. We owe Gordon our thanks.	2005-06-08

Not since John Law has there been another evil genius on the scale of Milken, whose re-writing of his own history also presages our modern world of constant spin by decades. Milken's debasement of capital markets begins with his misrepresentation of the seminal W. Braddock Hickman study of corporate bond returns, follows his testimony before Congress and his telling silence during his prosecution, and ends in a prison term he so richly deserved. Stein documents each detail carefully and well in a delightful and compelling style that is readable, funny, and horrifying. Unlike \\"Predators Ball\\" and other titles that focus on the glitz posing as glamour, and the fraud posing as capitalism, Stein's study is a character portrait that follows Milken's rise and fall while focusing on both the hubris and hamartia that makes up Milken's twisted worldview and sense of himself. Stein also correctly calls attention to Edward Altman's early sponsored research that further polluted the high yield market and extended Milken's criminal activity, and highlights the underappreciated study by Paul Asquith on cumulative default rates of high yield bonds to support the fact that yields did not pay for default risk with Milken's desk of Drexel Burnham Lambert in the market. If Stein has any flaw, it is that he is too hard on the concept of high yield (and therefore, high risk) bonds. Like John Law before him, Milken did do some good, but it was an accident of his actions, not his intention. For John Law, it was the tangible proof that an economy could survive and grow on paper script instead of coin. In the case of Milken, capital markets were sclerotic and entrepreneurs' access to financing was circumscribed to highly regulated and overly cautious banks. Milken forced banks to reexamine their own lending priorities to include a wider mix of risk profiles in their loan portfolios, and simultaneously encouraged the industry to lobby regulators for eased restrictions. Mercifully they were led in this effort by current Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. In hindsight, it now is obvious that banks and Savings and Loans were too constrained. It is equally obvious that the original issue high yield bond has a place in capital markets as part of a portfolio. But for a brief time in history there was a vacuum between banks, capital markets, entrepreneurs, regulators, and ratings agencies: filled by the evil ego that was and is Michael Milken.

The absence of detail in the hard gills of the famous \\"walking catfish\\" of Southeast Asia and South Florida is an example.

Efficient. Concise. Witty. Dry. Wry. Informative. Accurate. One hesitates to cease the superlatives, because Charles Coulombe truly has achieved something here: a work useful for the interested casual reader, or a student completing an assignment, or a reference librarian, or an expert. There is not a single word wasted, and those seeking further details would necessarily need to turn to specialized complete biographies and contemporary histories, but my advice would be to first read here for a well-thought through sketch before adding details from other sources.<br /><br />Because each Papal biography is contained within itself, Coulombe's Vicars of Christ is easy to put down and take up as time permits. In addition, it serves as a welcome contextual reference when you are reading another history and need a quick perspective on the Pope of the time. Perhaps the best place to read the book would be St. Paul Outside the Walls in Rome, with the famous mosaic portraits of the Popes, from Peter to John Paul the Great, along the nave. The small pen and ink sketches introducing each biography remind one of these similarly low-resolution depictions. In summation, Coulombe's Vicar's of Christ should be in the reference section of every public and private library as an essential work on the successors of St. Peter. In the interest of full disclosure, this reviewer and author Coulombe correspond on a variety of topics, however, my own admiration and thanks for that happy exchange in no way colors my opinion of this volume. \\"Vicars of Christ\\" is excellent on its own merits, and I commend it to both your reading pleasure and instruction.	2005-04-15

My thinking remains that my students have been well served by this textbook.<br /><br />The inadequacies that limit my assessment to four stars and need to be addressed in the third edition are: 1) frustrating errors in the text and models, for which the errata sheet and corrected models (available at: [...] only improve, but do not heal. My students find new, undocumented, errors each semester. 2) the data sets and examples are getting, frankly, a little old. It is the year 2005 as I write this, but the data sets and examples end in 1999, a year in which my current students were in high school. 3) the models, while excellent as introductions to the field, are now at the point of being fundamental, rather than exemplary. This is not Prof. Benninga's fault, but as the other reviews from professionals here attest, Excel modeling has advanced in all fields (option pricing, financial statements, portfolio optimization, bond metrics, etc). When this volume was introduced, it was adequate for helping MBA and Master of Science in Finance students build essential modeling skills. Sadly, it now is only appropriate for raw beginners or undergraduates. A new text with a larger scope that addresses advances in the fields is called for. 4) While it is a subject in itself, the book is seriously hindered by not introducing basic Monte Carlo simulation in Excel. 5) No information on downloading data from BLOOMBERG, REUTERS, and other historical and market data providers. It would add to the scope of the text, but 6) fitting DCF models to yield curves also would be welcome.<br /><br />Even with these criticisms, Benninga's Financial Modeling remains the best book in the field for what it seeks to accomplish. It covers the major topics of finance that are appropriately addressed with models: financial statement, firm valuation and credit metrics, portfolio construction, fixed income metrics, option pricing, etc. Benninga's  FM also compares favorably with his two nearest competitors.<br /><br />Powel and Baker's \\"The Art of Spreadsheet Modeling\\" is a two pronged monster: it seeks to be a meta-level theoretical work on spreadsheet modeling, and then introduces modeling Monte Carlo simulation as a fundamental component of Excel (a student edition of CrystalBall is included in the text, and is the only reason to buy this book). The gap between the two is a Grand Canyon's worth of knowledge space that this text does not fill in and nearly ignores. The student who uses only Powel and Baker is ill served; whereas if he uses Benninga, he knows how, why, when and what to model. Consider Powel & Baker as sketches of a concept car with simulated wind tunnel runs, whereas Benninga shows how to build your own kit car and drive it around. Powel and Baker's concept car is beautiful, advanced, gracious, but doesn't exist and doesn't run; Benninga's kit car is like a Lotus Super Seven: simple, runs, is a blast to drive, but is dangerous in heavy traffic and you would not want to go on a 1,000 mile journey with it (i.e. or build a DCF model for the Goldman Sachs LBO team with only Benninga).<br /><br />Chandan Sengupta's \\"Financial Modeling Using Excel and VBA\\" is the only book that comes close to Benninga, and I recommend it as another perspective for my students who want to continue with financial modeling. However, Sengupta's work is flawed on two counts: 1) it is clear throughout that he had read Benninga, and 2) he dropped much of Benninga's content in favor of adding wordy explanatory paragraphs to soften the blow of the fact that modeling is mathematically and technically both boring and intense work. With those criticisms in mind, his work still has neater, leaner, more compressed models with updated contemporary detail.<br /><br />There are three other books, Scott Proctor's \\"Building Financial Models with Microsoft Excel: A Guide for Business Professionals,\\" which focuses on building vanilla financial statements, as does John Tjia \\"Building Financial Models.\\" Mary Jackson & Mike Staunton's \\"Advanced Modeling in Finance using Excel and VBA\\" is also now dated and seriously flawed and limited in scope), however it is the next step following Benninga.<br /><br />For those working in top-tier banks, the internal training and modeling documents, and examples built by colleagues, will likely surpass by light years what is offered in these books. And so for beginners, Benninga remains the the best choice and first step, until something better comes along, or Benninga himself produces a new edition.uide for Business Professionals,\\" which focuses on building vanilla financial statements, as does John Tjia \\"Building Financial Models.\\" Mary Jackson & Mike Staunton's \\"Advanced Modeling in Finance using Excel and VBA\\" is also now dated and seriously flawed and limited in scope), however it is the next step following Benninga.<br /><br />For those working in top-tier banks, the internal training and modeling documents, and examples built by colleagues, will likely surpass by light years what is offered in these books.

This book blows anything by Fabozzi away. But I suppose that isn't saying much so let me be clearer: this book is worth it. There is no padding here (like some of Fabozzi's books), and there is no superficial treatment here (like most of Fabozzi's books). This is a clear, well-ordered, logical, useful, practical, interesting, well written, and above all, helpful book. It covers bonds very well, the term structure of interest rates and various theories very well, hedging duration thoroughly, investment strategies well, and swaps and futures in a helpful (but by no means comprehensive) way. It also covers interest rate modeling and assumptions with particular attention to credit spreads (but again, as an introduction, not a comprehensive treatment). The lightest chapter is on securtized products (MBS, ABS, CAT bonds, etc.), but those sub-fields are best left to specialized texts (which hopefully these authors will write and address with better clarity than you-know-who). Unlike a lot of books I have purchased on fixed-income for school, teaching, and work, this one is definitely worth it. I highly recommend it as a through introduction to a broad range of fixed income instruments, but also recommend that folks looking for specifics in sub fields (high yield, distressed, asset-backed, structured products, etc.) turn to more specialized texts. I now recommend this text to my students over others available covering the same material.	2004-09-23

Neftci's `Principles of Financial Engineering' is a triumph. Neftci's `Principles' joins Mason and Merton's \\"Cases in Financial Engineering\\" as the field's premier fundamental texts, most especially for students, but of practical use for practitioners as well. Neftci's chief strength in this work is the same that has made his \\"An Introduction to the Mathematics of Financial Derivatives\\" deservedly famous: clarity. Where other authors get bogged down in dark obscurantism, such as Beaumont's unsatisfying and inadequate \\"Financial Engineering Principles,\\" or Galitz's risk management book, inappropriately titled \\"Financial Engineering: Tools and Techniques to Manage Financial Risk,\\" Neftci sheds clear sunlight on the field of constructing structured products with the building blocks of financial instruments. He is the most gifted writer in practical financial mathematics, and his legions of fans are not wrong: there is no one better than Neftci at breaking down complex concepts in clear, digestible bites and then reassembling the whole. Neftci's `Principles' improves upon, and indeed replaces, Cuthbertson and Nitzsche's \\"Financial Engineering: Derivatives and Risk Management\\" for applicability and lucidity, and replaces Mashall's \\"Financial Engineering: A Complete Guide to Financial Innovation\\" in scope. But Neftci does not sacrifice addressing difficult or complex structures through useless over simplicity, as sadly is the case with Eales's \\"Financial Engineering,\\" rather he builds his explanations smoothly and logically, shedding light on the topics at hand by continually clearly demonstrating a replicating portfolio that mimics the instrument using other asset classes. For example, he begins by addressing the construction of cash flows with forward contracts, and then moves on to interest rate derivatives, swaps, repos, and then puts them all together for dynamic replication methods and the construction of synthetics. Each chapter builds and sheds light on the next instrument and technique. By the time Neftci addresses options and applications to bond convexity strategies and credit derivatives, we are in a position of strength. Most notable is Chapter 14, which clearly reviews volatility trading and discusses both the strengths and pitfalls, before turning to the nearly endless problem and opportunities of volatility smiles. He does not turn away from the problem of pricing in the presence of smiles, and uses the example of trading in the FX markets to shed light on strategies. For those working on synthetic and structured products desks, this will be the premier text. For those working on credit derivatives and other derivatives desks, this work assists in clarifying basic financial engineering concepts that then are more appropriately addressed in specialized texts, Sch&ouml;nbucher's \\"Credit Derivatives Pricing Models,\\" for example. For those seeking a more rigorous mathematical foundation to financial engineering, Capinski & Zastawniak's  \\"Mathematics for Finance: An Introduction to Financial Engineering\\" or the works of Steven Shreve and Ioannis Karatzas are the volumes to turn to. But for a solid work for a student who wishes to be a practitioner, Neftci is always the first choice. For the instructor, this book, coupled with the above-mentioned `Cases' will provide the exact balance between techne and arte that provides students with the best education for engineering structured products. There is a single caveat to my otherwise wholehearted praise for this book: those already deeply familiar with these topics will find little new here: this is not a groundbreaking work announcing new techniques or research. Rather, the strength of Neftci's `Principles' again is clarity clarity clarity. This is a most welcome volume, the one I wish I had had as a graduate student, which leaves this reviewer envious of those who will benefit and have stronger careers due to its current availability. We owe Neftci our thanks..	2004-08-27

Partridge has done a wonderful service for students of the life of King Charles, martyr; particularly for those who continue to lament the impropriety of the dearth of appropriate memorials to Charles's memory. `O Horrable Murder' serves to refresh the memory of experts, and provides useful background and context for those beginning to study his life and martyrdom.<br />Partridge begins with an accurate and compressed recounting of King Charles's life, then focuses on his imprisonment, last days, trial, execution, and burial. He is adept at synthesizing familiar material from secondary sources, but goes the extra mile correcting errors that have crept into the record by consulting primary sources. For those efforts alone Partridge is to be commended. But this book's primary strengths are the organization of familiar and new details about Charles's final resting place, and the stunning examples of the neglect he has suffered in death. This book provides valuable information for those who argue today for a more appropriate and larger shrine to his memory.<br />Partridge throughout keeps his sympathies well in check: his factual work is scrupulously accurate and fair. Not every detail selected or featured will please Royalists, and some of Partridge's historical analysis might be discussed with alternate views, but by and large he is an author that defends the martyr case and the cause of Charles's memory because he doesn't argue: he presents the facts.<br />Partridge's writing style is brief, clear, and clean, but most commendably he is a master of selecting details that give focus to the argument of the neglect of King Charles. Yet, the argument is not made explicitly, but rather by allusion. Partridge carefully details the initial actions of the interested parties in Charles's day that had neither the resources, nor the power, to provide him with a more suitable burial. He continues to recount the processes and delays for a Restoration memorial through the reigns of Charles II and James II. He then provides the most ironic section of the book, \\"1649 to 1813,\\" detailing the long period of ignoring Charles. Partridge furthers the unstated argument by providing details of Charles's relics being displayed without piety but as a \\"curiosity.\\" He then carefully and fully describes the standard treatment dead English Royalty ordinarily would be served. The contrast with Charles's treatment cries out from the vault of Saint George's Chapel at Windsor castle.<br />Partridge's strengths as a historian are evident throughout, but his work with neglected primary sources is the volume's real contribution. Chapter twelve for example is a transcription and comments on Sir Henry Halford's account of the exhumation of Charles in 1813, unearthed when workmen accidentally broke through the unmarked vault in St George's Chapel. The exhumation revealed how the body of the King had been prepared for burial, which enables a comparison to be made between his and other royal burials of this period and furthers the case for Charles's neglect. Halford discusses medical evidence from the king's body, and strikes a fine balance on including thorough pathological detail without descending to the ghoulish, however, this chapter safely can be skipped by those whose piety or other proclivities would prevent review.<br />Chapter thirteen contains perhaps the one disappointment of this book: Partridge provides information of how the martyred King's resting place finally came to be marked with a slab of black granite in 1837 by King William IV.  The information, but not the story; as Partridge notes \\"Exactly why William IV decided to have the site marked may never be known.\\"  Well, readers want to know the story, and Partridge has done such an excellent job teasing out the telling detail, correcting the misleading error, and synthesizing the available information so far the reader is left curious as to why he stops on this subject.<br />`O Horrable Murder' includes for the first time in print a transcription of the Tuesday, December 13th, 1888 account \\"REPLACING OF RELICS in THE GRAVE OF CHARLES I.\\"<br />In a sadly annoying conclusion he lauds as a fitting epitaph for the Martyr King the Puritan poet Andrew Marvell's well-known lines about Charles, in a poem otherwise glorifying Oliver Cromwell. Well it is not a fitting epitaph, not nearly adequate enough, as Partridge's whole own book makes all too clear.<br />  Partridge includes several excellent additions to his main subject matter that further illuminate his focus and provide useful guides. \\"Principal Players\\" for example, is a collection of sketches of the figures involved in Charles's life, imprisonment, trial, execution and burial. \\"The Banqueting House and the Window Leading to the Scaffold\\" is the best treatment ever regarding the specific window Charles's used to ascend the scaffold and meet his maker. \\"Signatories to The Death Warrant of King Charles I\\" collects all the usual suspects in one quick reference, but sadly does not come as a perforated detachable page for use as a darts target.<br />\\"The Death of A Monarch\\" provides detail on English royal burial customs that preceded and followed the death of King Charles, martyr, and serves to accentuate the level of neglect and impropriety he suffered. Those who wish to avoid technical, medical, and clinical treatments of the dead would be advised to skip the first 23 paragraphs (until the middle of page 162) of this appendix, and then continue on with the fascinating details about coffin ornamentation for royalty, the construction of life-like funeral effigies, and elaborate temporary monuments.<br />Appendix IV provides an introduction to the activities of The Sealed Knot, of which Partridge is a leading member. \\"The Society stages a wide variety of seventeenth century historical military reenactments, throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain.\\" Partridge notes that the modern society of The Sealed Knot is \\"non-political...and includes both Royalists and Parliamentarians within its ranks.\\" Of course the members of the original society of The Sealed Knot were loyal Royalists who eventually succeeded in restoring Charles II to the throne, although not without their own martyrs along the way.<br />The book includes 58 rare and seldom available illustrations that contribute helpful detail, many the author's own competently executed pen and ink sketches made to amplify historical points in the text. Most startling is the cover, which on first glance appears to be a close up photograph of the face of King Charles. It isn't of course, but rather a \\"soft-focus\\" photograph of his wax likeness at the famous Madame Tussaud's of London.<br />The Bibliography contains the usual secondary sources familiar to students of the English Civil Wars, however he also includes primary source surprises such as King Charles I, his Death, his Funeral, his Relics, by Edmund H. Fellows (Windsor Castle, 1950), and Essays and Orations, including An account of the opening of the Tomb of King Charles I, by Sir Henry Halford (John Murray, 1831). The index is quite good, but not exhaustive, and further editions would need improvement as it covers proper names only and excludes topics and subjects.<br />`O Horrable Murder' is printed by a very small London-based press, which no doubt accounts for its rather dear price.

But for a nut-work gotta-price-this-bugger-cause-my-boss-asked-me-to-and-Im-the-quant-guy-in-the-shop this guide, while not strictly a cookbook, is indispensable. Although it begins at a relatively basic level, it clearly and concisely explains every technique from the simple (y = mx + b) and then step-by-step ratchets up to the Excel-samuri level (MIN and MAX tests after multiple operations of option pricing trees (bi-nomial and tri-nomial)).<br />I limited my rating to four stars, however, because Connolly only mentions in passing the available (expensive) software-house products that do many of the same things his example spreadsheets do.  Fin software needs critics, and I can think of no one better placed than the author to examine them and give front-line quant analysts his views.<br />In addition, like most worker bees, I try never to reinvent the wheel (programming in C++ and VB or anything else for this kinda thing is undiluted soul-destroying tedium), but at the same time want to thoroughly check out the foundational theory and techniques someone applied before I risk my career on someone elses work. In this case, a good list of the academic sources and current financial literature on the topic would have been a useful and welcome addition to this slender volume.<br />I suppose a final criticism is that we have all seen the exponential growth of credit derivatives in the past few years. Connollys next edition will need to address the topic of credit derivatives in relation to convertible bonds, as their use in combination with CBs provides alternate hedging, investment, and speculative strategies not explicitly considered in this book.	2001-08-15
