Ward makes the strongest case yet for accentuating the positive in examining the life of Dr. von Braun, but still falls short of a balanced examination of the rocket scientist's wartime career.  The major limitation of the book is the sketchy, at times almost non-existent, discussion of the technical details of developing the V-2 and the later US missiles and space launchers. (Compare this to \\"Rocket and the Reich\\" for instance.) Ward reports many positive comments by other engineers about von Braun's engineering skills, but hardly any examples are described.  Overall, recommended, especially for space and military collections, but not the definitive work.	2005-06-28

The author shows how the operations were conceived, how they worked (or didn't, in too many cases) and what the results were.  He provides a good discussion of Air America and the use of non-US nationals in these operations such as Nationalist Chinese, Tibetans and Cubans.  He also mentions why certain aircraft were chosen for certain missions. Peebles compares the success of the Special Operations Executive and the OSS in World War Two with the failures during the Cold War, and his summary of the meager results of these later covert operations is straight-forward and honest: while the operations might have had some greater degree of success, the very nature of the totalitarian states they were aimed at presented a huge obstacle in infiltrating outsiders who could effectively create and sustain a resistance movement.  For readers who want to know more about a particular operation, the bibliography is a great starting place.  My chief reservations about this title are (1) a lack of maps (not the author's fault!) and (2) no discussion of whether there any new air-supported covert ops after the fall of South Vietnam--did they stop completely, or is sufficient information lacking to say anything about them?  Despite those (minor) criticisms, this book is highly recommended, especially for libraries who may not have much else on Cold War covert operations.	2005-06-27

He credits MacArthur for his operational abilities while not overlooking or excusing away his faults: occasional overly-optimistic planning, poor use of intelligence, rocky relations with the US Navy, distrust of our Australian allies, and certain decisions relating to the removal of subordinates.  The book does not overlook the contributions of the Australians and points out some of the logistical and political limits that affected the Aussies.  The contributions of the US Navy and US Army Air Forces are considered, as well as the medical conditions that the Allied forces faced. Decisions by Japanese commanders are discussed and considered, something not all \\"popular\\" histories do well. <br /> The book is primarily drawn from secondary sources, though most of those are official and unit histories, but the source notes do credit some interviews with participants and archival materials. <br />   On the downside, the book suffers from: inconsistent mapping, as some operations get a map while others do not; a lack of an order of battle; and some of the sloppiest copy-editing I've seen from a major publisher--inconsistent capitalization (half the time it is \\"thirteenth Air Force\\", the other half \\"Thirteenth Air Force\\"), inconsistent proper names (the 1st Infantry Regiment is identified in three location with two pages as the \\"1st Regiment\\" [inaccurate], \\"1st Infantry\\" [better] and \\"1st RCT\\" [best-but nowhere is the significance of RCT as \\"regimental combat team\\" explained]), and constant misspelling of Japanese names.  And would it kill an editor to insist on an explanation of the seemingly-odd numbering system of Australian units e.g. why one unit is the 2/24th and the other the 56th/57th?  On balance, these are irritants, and do not substantially detract from the book's quality. <br />  Overall, strongly recommended for any collection with an interest in the Second World War.	2005-05-25

That aside, this is a very good book. <BR>   Disney took on the collective work of Dan O'Neill and the Air Pirates after they issued parodies of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters.  Or, as intellectual property (IP) lawyers say, &quot;properties.&quot;  Levin's work emphasizes the case, how it came about, how it moved through the courts, and what the disposition was. As a result, the reader gets a good idea of how IP cases work, and what was at stake.  He discusses the notion of parody, infringement, and so on, pointing the oddities and contradictions in the statutory and case law.  (But, hey, a case citation once in a while, counselor?) The publishers reproduce some of the offending material, letting the reader see what Disney saw.  Levin also does not glorify O'Neill or the other Air Pirates, though he clearly supports their side, and says that getting the real story from O'Neill and his crew was not always easy.  Finally, if this book causes a few more folks to seek out O'Neill's &quot;Odds Bodkins&quot;, it will have done a great service. Like UG comics? Don't miss this. IP lawyer? A must read.	2003-07-14

The Battle of El Alamein is bound up in considerations of the dominant general on both sides, Montgomery for the British and Rommel for the Germans and Italians.  Latimer describes the battle at a level of detail that keeps the reader from becoming confused, while pointing out that the battle itself WAS confusing. Both Montgomery and Rommel are fairly criticized, Montgomery for taking too much credit upon himself and Rommel for deliberately ignoring logistical concerns.  Latimer, however, is not out to \\"debunk\\" either general, and in fact supports Montgomery against some charges laid against him by Corelli Barnett (DESERT GENERALS.) Latimer makes sure to credit the Italians when they did fight, and shows that while the British manned the tanks, Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans carried the day as the infantry.  He also significantly discusses the excellent British logistical preparations, pointing out that the British had been supporting armies overseas since the 18th century and knew the importance of ports, roads, and supply centers.  He also describes the contribution of the Desert Air Force, which included US fighter and light bomber units.  As far as negatives, this reviewer didn't care for the clustering of maps at the beginning, and would have appreciated a British-to-American glossary as well as some extended discussion about relative equipment scales between the forces; Latimer, like many historians of the Desert Campaign, focusses almost exclusively on tank counts and overlooks the differing numbers of artillery and support vehicles.  Nonetheless, hightly recommended.	2003-02-26

Wright's book reads more like a collection of essays than a coherent study of the social image of the tank.  Some of the chapters are good (the mysticism of J.F.C. Fuller, the tank in Poland) while others show weak research (the modern U.S. Army and the tank.)  In some places, especially as the book closes in on contemporary issues, one can easily detect the modern academics sniffy disdain for anyone who wears a uniform. Especially an American uniform. And where is any discussion of the image of victorious panzers in Nationalist Socialist propaganda? Nonetheless, this is book worth reading, less so for the tank buff than for a reader who is interested more in the impact of war upon society.

While the incidents he relates are worth reading about, more useful are his comments about dealing with the (former) East Germans and Soviets, and observations on the Russian character.  His memoir should serve as a excellent example of how fluent and perceptive linguists are crucial to intelligence operations.  His comments about one (unnamed) mission chief provides a good example of how carefully intelligence agencies should choose their personnel. One very minor shortcoming: Cdr. Fahey's assignment was to the US Military Liaison Mission to the Soviet forces in East Germany.  The Soviets had a similar mission in West Germany.  Were their &quot;licensed&quot; spying activities similar?  Recommended for those interested in intelliegnce activities, the Cold War, and the Soviet/Russian military.	2002-06-12

Guillemin's fascinating story of the research conducted in Russia to find the truth behind the 1979 anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk, now Yaketerinburg says much about life under the old Soviet regime.  Official silence on key  information compunded with official statements never really believed by  those hearing it lead to all sorts of wild rumors, many repeated by the US  government which probably had little firm evidence to go on.  (Given that  many major disasters under the Soviet regime such as plane crashes, subway  cave-ins and train wrecks were never publicly announced, US analysts might  well have thought they were being reasonable in their reports of  &quot;thousands&quot; dead in a release of anthrax spores.) The research  steps taken by the Harvard University team, including the interviews  conducted by Guillemin and her Russian assistants are laid out.  The author  recounts her reactions and those she interviews, showing the impact the  outbreak had on the residents downwind of the mysterious Compound 19. She  points how certain features of the Soviet regime assisted her : the lack of  mobility for residents kept most survivors and relatives of the victims in  the same neighborhoods, which made locating them for interviews much  easier, and the centralized nature of the Soviet government enabled public  health officials to quickly mobilize a response, saving some lives.  &quot;Anthrax&quot; contains a rich bibliography for those with further  interest in the history and use of biological weapons.  The author  restrains her obvious outrage at the existence and use of these weapons,  hoping that publicizing their existence and potential threat will encourage  the rest of us to take steps to contain and eventually eliminate them. To  her credit, she does point out how public scares can exaggerate the  usefulness of bio-weapons, and become excuses for continued restriction on  the freedoms of the public. Recommended for those in public health and  epidemiology, those concerned with the threat of biological weapons, and  historians of the Former Soviet Union.	1999-11-16

The development of the successful Sidewinder (AIM-9) heat-seeking missile deserves a book.  This one is almost it.  The author discusses not only technical problems and their solutions but also the managerial side of  weapons development.  Unfortunately, there is too much chronological  back-and-forth to allow one to get an idea of how the technical solutions  worked off preceding developments; a graphic timeline would have allowed  the reader to know what happened when.  Westrum doesn't discuss the what  the China Lake center was doing, and how it was doing it before the  scientists and engineers responsible for Sidewinder showed up. While there  is some discussion of the social activities of the Sidewinder personnel,  this review er never got a feel for the whole China Lake setting. Westrum  relies too heavily on &quot;telling&quot; and not &quot;showing&quot; ; in  some places he says that certain defense contractors had problems managing  their programs, but provides little evidence of what he would base that  on.(Not to say that private industry contractors haven't had problems; this  reviewers knowledge of McDonnell Douglas problems makes him sympathetic to  any story of How The Navy Could Do It Better.) The author wants to use  China Lake and the Sidewinder project as a possible model of how to  correctly manage a weapons project, but his story comes off more as a paean  to certain personnel.  If the secret of success is the right manager or  designer or technician, this book might give us some guidance on selecting  those people (flexible, open-minded, creative, informal, dedicated,  technically competent) but there must also be some managerial methods and  organizational that get lost in an emphasis on personality.  Still,  recommended for anyone interested in modern air combat, aerospace  technology, or defense management.	1999-11-16

Why did Switzerland keep its independence during World War Two?  According to Stephen Halbrook, it is due to a well-armed Swiss population that cooperated just enough with the Axis to not anger Hitler and just enough  with the Allies to keep diplomatic relations alive.  The delicate dance  between a powerful neighbor you don't like and a distant friend is the lot  of a neutral and some found that the Nazis were too-often their partners :  Sweden has admitted to allowing the passage of German troops through their  nation.  Halbrook argues that be being just friendly enough to Hitler and  hence useful, it made the cost of invasion too high.  Terrain certainly had  much to do with it, and Halbrook shows that the Swiss high command was  willing to give up about half their country in order to conserve their  forces to defend a mountainous and more defensible portion.  Yet, constant  repetition of the point that all Swiss soldiers were good shots seems to  simple; at one point Halbrook seems to claim that all Swiss soldiers were  riflemen.  The Swiss army included ski units, cavalry, mountain artillery,  and even bicycle units, giving them a high degree of tactical mobility.   The country also boasted extensive fortifications, with no easy means of  getting around them.  Surely these considerations also contributed to a  perception of a small-yet-formidable army?  Halbrook defends Switzerland  against charges of anti-Semitism and refusing entry to refugee Jews; his  evidence seems slim and doesn't seem to fully engage the critics.  Further,  his defense of Switzerland seems to often rely on quoting newspaper  editorials in places far removed from the Alps.  Finally, the narrative in  the book continues after the war into a discussion of targetshooting  events.  Huh?  A clear theme in this book is the importance of a citizen's  militia in national defense, and those plucky Swiss who keep military  weapons in their homes.  No problem with that, except that if your point  really is just a lengthy historical example in support of Second Amendment  rights, just say so. (Disclosure : I'm agreeable to arguments in favor of  personal ownership of firearms, just don't base it on paranoia.) No need,  as Halbrook does at one point, to bad-mouth the unready armies of the  Netherlands and Norway, a nation that, in 1940, was full of well-armed  citizens. An emphasis on straight-shootin' Swiss soldiers simplifies the  historical analysis.    Nontheless, recommended for those interested in  Swizerland in WW2.	1999-11-16

Mike Spick has been writing about modern air combat for some years and the experience shows.  He covers the development of modern jet fighters introduced or in development from the 1970s onward, the &quot;post-Phantom&quot; generation.  If you are interested in air-to-air  combat, this is recommended.  With two caveats, however.  One, have some  background in either flying or engineering, as the author assumes a certain  basic knowledge of both.  Secondly, don't expect abbreviations to be  explained the first, or even second time they are used.  For example,  &quot;sfc&quot; (for &quot;specific fuel consumption&quot;) isn't explained  until two chapters after its first appearance.  Also, expect a number of  Britishisms that are simply mystifying to any Yanks who may be reading.	1999-10-11

Anyone interested in tanks and mechanized infantry in the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps ought to read this collection of historical essays.  The emphasis is upon technical and doctrinal development, and while most of  these topics have been treated elsewhere, their compilation here makes for  a nice (if uneven) survey.  Strengths: the discussion of armor use in the  Marine Corps, the recognition that U.S. tank destroyers were as significant  as tanks during WWII, the development of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and  the relationship of doctrinal development and the use of armor in the 1970s  and 1980s.  This reviewer faults an emphasis on post-WWII developments, a  lack of discussion on armored artillery or the seemingly-immortal M113 and  its variants, glossing over survivability criticisms of the M2/M3, a lack  of tabular comparative technical data, and limited discussion of armored  and mechanized tables of organization and equipment.  That said, highly  recommended for any modern military collection.	1999-10-06

Eumeswil has no easily discernable narrative, but rather a series of almost-episodes that trigger a series of philospohical ruminations by Martin Venator, the narrator.  He observes power but removes himself from  it, describing himself as an anarch, responsible no one but himself, not  judging history or individuals. In doing so, he ends up serving the Condor  as both a barkeep and as a collaborator.  Our narrator doesn't see that by  standing aside from autocracy, he enables its perpetuation.  He would  rather spend hours in front of a historical simulation device called the  luminar and working to create a little refuge in a nearby river delta,  indicative of his remove from the world around him.  Not an &quot;airplane  book&quot; by any means, but worthwhile as a glimpse as to how intellect  can convince itself to serve power.	1999-09-29

This book is essential reading for any serious student of the Japanese Empire, as well as anyone interested in the history of colonialism or Chinese-Japanese relations.  Young shows that Japan's occupation of  Manchuria and the subsequent transformation into Manchukuo may have been  initially driven by the Imperial Army, but became an effort supported by  various other political and economic agencies.  She also describes how a  perceived Japanese mission of improving fellow Asian nations may have been  sincere, but was ultimately destructive. TOTAL EMPIRE is best read in  conjunction with THE ABACUS AND THE SWORD, about Japan's colonial  relationship with Korea.  Military historians will find Young's book weak  on details of the military administration, but that doesn't seriously  detract from the social and cultural historical value of the work.	1999-08-25

I found his  discussion of mashing techniques to be one of the more organized I have  read in a homebrewers manual.  He is also upbeat about the possibility of  culturing yeasts from such Belgian beers as Orval and Chimay--this has  definitely encouraged me to try to do so.

Okay, look, books like this have three purposes : one, to entertain; two, to teach; three, to inspire.  Entertainment-wise, this isn't too bad.  It does suffer from flat characters, a female who seems to exist only to show  how lousy the press can be and to change her mind (&quot;what was I  thinking!&quot;), and the predictable US victory.  However, the pacing is  good, the good guys don't get everything handed to them, and the bad guys  get some credit for competence.  I actually didn't even mind the ending as  the author doesn't just pull it out of thin air (if you NEED a quick  victory and you PROMISE a quick victory, but you DON'T get a quick victory,  you're in trouble...) Education-wise, the book is pretty obvious, with one  set-piece delaying action and one set-piece attack. Inspiration-wise, well  that depends on the individual.  It will make me look for Antal's next  novel. If you like mechanized warfare, fall out and go get it, soldier.	1999-08-25

The obvious parallel in this novella is between the anatomist Mateo Columbo, and the explorer Christoforo Columbo.  Each may have expanded the universe of knowledge of their time, but did so for personal gain as much  as any devotion to a Quest for Truth.  The anatomist's search for the means  to control women through their &quot;passion&quot; is also a means to  impose his passion upon the unobtainable great puttana Mona Sofia.     This  reviewer sees an additional parallel suugested by the fact that the author  is a psychiatrist.	1999-05-24

Michell not only covers the US effort, he also reports on what the North Vietnamese did.  Though this story is not part of his main narrative, he shows that the NVN Air Force fought hard, learned from their mistakes, and  tried to make the best use possible from their MiGs and SAMs.  Two points  Michell never makes : first, any NVN pilot who successfully bailed out  would land in his home country and would be able to get back into a  cockpit; US pilots could only do so if they were rescued, a very complex  operation that might involve additional losses.  Second, if any NVN pilot  did decide to go beyond the GCI-controlled airspace, they might be tempted  to defect.  Possible?  Couldn't rule it out : NVN ground troops defected,  and a couple of North Korean pilots have done so over the years. This book  is highly recommended not only for those interested in the Vietnam War, but  also those interested in the development of aerial tactics and weaponry.	1999-04-15

Author James Grace does a very good on describing the actions of the U.S. and Japanese forces during the naval battle of Guadalcanal, especially given that the action was a night-time slugging match.  His coverage of the  Japanese combatants is appreciated.  He also covers the immediate aftermath  of the battle, detailing some of the stories of damaged ships and overboard  sailors.  The author generally eschews dramatic writing, and doesn't spend  a lot of ink second-guessing the commanders.  He lets the story, especially  the limited success of radar and the tragic episodes of &quot;friendly  fire,&quot; speak for themselves.  A major weakness of the book is the  overly-short discussion of the near-term effects of the battle on the  Guadalcanal campaign.  The author also assumes that the reader is familiar  with the layout and design of surface warships. Nonetheless, highly  recommended for those interested in the Solomons Campaign, naval operations  in the Pacific during World War Two, or in naval surface warfare.	1999-04-07

In the service he became one of the first Black machinist's mates (MM) and was assigned to a maintenance unit in the Philippines.  After the war, he reeenlisted in the Navy and served on a  repair ship.  His memoir is honest and personal, and includes frank  descriptions of looking for (and finding) women and liquor in liberty ports  around the world.  Occasionally he even had to stand up for his right to  fight for his country.  He did suffer gratuitous racial insults and unfair  discipline, and speaks candidly about his opinions about white folks.  An  interesting touch is his love of jazz and popular music; MM Newton  frequently recalls what songs were popular at a particular time and even  takes credit for exposing other sailors on his repair ship to bebop.  The  main shortcomings of this book can be laid to the publisher : no index, no  maps, and no glossary.  Overall, strongly recommended for those interested  in the integration of the U.S. Navy and the common life of the naval  enlisted man.

The author's research is  solidly historical and scientific (he mines demographic, criminological,  and anthropological sources.)  While some of his premises are controversial  (evolutionary behaviorism and Moynihan's views on the breakdown of society  in the black inner cities), he recognizes the interplay between genetics  and culture, and points out that societies can become less violent over  time given the right circumstances.  The author also points out where  &quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; disagree over root  causes and possible solutions.  Highly recommended for those interested in  American social history, criminology, and urban issues.	1999-02-22

It is difficult to select adult videos, no doubt about it.  Especially for women.  Now, I'm a straight male, so (supposedly) just about anything would work for me, but in reality, I'm fairly selective.  Sexy, like funny,  differs greatly from one person to another, so just because my best friend  may like a video entitled &quot;Nothin' But Breasts&quot; I may not.  The  &quot;sex positive&quot; (and mostly female) crew at Open Enterprises/Good  Vibrations has put together a guide to what they think are videos worth  watching, on the basis of actual storyline, performance, attention to a  female viewpoint, and diversity of cast. The effort is appreciated, but to  a large degree it is compilation of the brief reviews found in their  earlier mail order catalogs.  The brief reviews are handy, but seem skimpy  in a book-length format. A lengthy grouping of videos by interest  (S/M,  Feminist, Gay Male, etc.) or performer (Nina Hartly, Jenna Jameson, Seka,  etc.) would help, as would some additional artwork.  The text includes a  brief history of adult films from the 1970s onward, so this title can  definitely be considered educational.  I would especially recommend this  book to viewers who are curious about adult videos but don't want to spend  all that time in the little room in the back of the video store.	1999-02-16

A major theme of this novel is :  Duty Calls.  There are few individual choices made by characters here.  The  chief narrator, Xeones, is forced by circumstances to flee his home city  and live in the mountains.  Eventually, he chooses to join Sparta--yet that  choice is compelled by his desire for the solidarity of a city, especially  one that is secure.  The Spartans do not freely choose to be warriors, as  that is their lot in life decided long ago by Lykurges.  Their women cry as  their sons and husbands march off to war, but that is their lot as it keeps  their farms and homes from the devastation war brings to others.  The novel  frequently mentions the gods, sacrificial offerings, and omens; even the  skeptical find comfort in them in the stress of campaigning.  This is a  worldview far from our own, and it is tro Pressfield's credit that he  presents the characters alive within it.	1999-01-05

As he advised Cambodians largely resident in South Vietnam, Scott brings out the  nationalistic elements in the conflict.  (This reviewer strongly believes  that nationalism kept the VC and the NVA going, not Communism.)  Scott  discusses the civil war in Cambodia during that period and connects it to  Cambodia's ancient past.  My main criticism is twofold : a confusing  timeline as Scott jumps around mixing national, military and personal  histories, and a viewpoint that may reflect Cambodian biases.  A larger  complaint : the Cambodians here, like the Montagnards and Nungs in other  books on the Vietnam War, are labelled &quot;mercenaries.&quot;  Why?   Because U.S. forces paid them to fight?  The South Vietnamese soldier was  paid to fight, and many of them seemed less interested in the war than a  good number of the ethnic minorities in the country.  Are these soldiers  &quot;mercenaries&quot; because they fought under American command?  The  term &quot;mercenary&quot; implies an attitude that the soldier so  described doesn't really care about what the fight is about, but only that  he makes it to pay day.  In &quot;Lost Crusade&quot; Scott shows that, in  fact, the Cambodians did have a definite ethnic identity and a purpose for  fighting. The NVA was seen as a Vietnamese force and not a universal  liberator of the oppressed and downtrodden, and the Diem and Thieu regimes  as  authorities to be survived, not embraced.  The Cambodians may not have  cared about who was in power in Saigon, but they cared very much that  whoever was in power in Saigon had designs on Cambodia. If fighting for Ho  or Thieu (or Westmoreland) would result in their achieving autonomy or  independence, they would do that.	1998-12-30

Forester and Patrick O'Brian have set a high bar for novels set in the &quot;Age of Fighting Sail.&quot; Some authors such as Alexander Kent or James Nelson meet or get close to that bar.  Unfortunately, William Mack  does not.  To be fair, I must admit that I have not read his series of  novels set on a World War Two destroyer, so I can't say if this book is any  better or worse.  I can say that it suffers from rather flat characters, a  lack of that descriptive &quot;color&quot; that makes the reader feel a  participant in some grand historic event, and dialogue that sounds far too  modern. The last is particularly jarring : one bit of dialogue refers to  &quot;kicking their butt&quot;; another refers to English as  &quot;Brits,&quot; a twentieth-century term. At one point a character  refers to &quot;Texans.&quot;  In 1777? Wasn't it called &quot;Tejas&quot;  then?  Recommended for real Fighting Sail enthusiasts only.	1998-11-19

Martin Van Creveld is a contrarian.  This new history of the Israeli Defense Forces (TSAHAL) is by turns complimentary and critical.  It starts with the development of self defense forces established in Palestine under  the Ottomans and continues forward through the British mandate, then  through the various wars up through the Intifada. Enough campaign history  is provided to buttress the author's criticism and praise of various  leaders. While Van Creveld is critical of the amateur (and often vengeful)  nature of the early Zionist and Israeli forces, he does credit them for  high morale, aggressive leadership, the ability to learn from mistakes, and  to effectively improvise where needed.  For Van Creveld the myth of Israeli  invincibility rested on stunning successes and tight censorship that  covered up mistakes and would-be mistakes. The fall of the IDF starts with  the ill-considered invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and accelerated with the  response to the Intifada in the late 1980s. Van Creveld sees the surest  sign of IDF failure as the inability to participate in the Gulf War; this  criticism is unfair and unrealistic as the Israeli military was not  designed to project so much power so far, and any Israeli participation in  the Coalition would have broken down the anti-Hussein consensus among the  Arab participants. Van Creveld shows that the IDF no longer enjoys the  invincible reputation and high status that it did 20 years ago. The book  covers many topics : the development of Israel's arms industry, the  &quot;tank is king&quot; mentality that was so disasterous at the beginning  of the 1973 October War, the effect of Israel's nuclear capability, the  entangling of party politics, the rise of the Air Force, the usually  marginal nature of the Navy, and the status of women.  Two interesting  aspects of this book : the not-quite-standard English rendering of Hebrew  and Arabic words (Mount Chermon for Mt. Hermon, Beqa Valley for Bekaa  Valley) and the frequent citation to popular songs, jokes, and sayings that  reflect the public image of the IDF. Highly recommended for anyone  interested in the Middle East or in the development of national military  systems.	1998-11-03

If Kara Hultgreen had been a man, she would have been just one more competitive, headstrong Navy aviator with an annoying &quot;I'm right, you're wrong&quot; attitude.  As a woman determined to fly F-18s, she  wasn't just one more of anything, and through both her presence in  male-dominated units and a willingness to engage the media in her struggle,  stood forward as a challenge to historic sex roles in the Navy.  In doing  so, of course, she made life much more difficult for herself and those  around her.  Her biography, written by her mother attorney Sally Spears,  benefits from access to letters and journals, as well as many interviews  from instructors and squadron-mates.  Spears had decidedly mixed feelings  about her daughter's desires to fly in harm's way; this book is not so much  a plea for women to become combat pilots as it is a story (and defense) of  a woman who became one.  Whether or not you want to see women flying into  battle, this book shows that some women will have the desire and ability.   If you think that Lt. Hultgreen was unqualified and got special treatment,  you have to overcome the evidence presented in CALL SIGN REVLON that if  anything she was held to a tougher standard.  A &quot;must-read&quot; for  anyone interested in women in the military, and a strong recommendation for  anyone interested in the Navy or combat aviation.	1998-11-02

It is possible to see the beginning of a revisionist school of historical  writing on Vietnam.  Spector's AFTER TET, Burkitt's STOLEN VALOR, and now  PHOENIX AND THE BIRDS OF PREY all represent a point of view that wants to  remove the stigma of absolute failure from the U.S. military efforts in  Vietnam.  Moyar's book is more than a simple defense of the Phoenix/Phung  Hoang program; it is a study of intelligence-gathering, pacification  programs and their effectiveness against the NVA and the Viet Cong.  Moyar  concentrates on the post-Tet period which he argues saw increased American  and South Vietnamese success in counterinsurgency.  He collates interviews,  translated captured documents, official statistics, and memoirs for his  history and does a pretty fair job of evaluating the material.  Moyar  criticizes plenty of Americans and Vietnamese, and credits the NVA/VC for  excellent motivation, organization  and determination.  Not all of his  arguments are persuasive, but the breadth of his work must be considered by  anyone who wants to challenge him.      The response by an earlier  &quot;reviewer&quot; at this site (&quot;...CIA propaganda...&quot;) is  enlightening. One of the moral bases of the 1960s political movements was  opposition to the war in Vietnam.  The antiwar movement cast the U.S. in a  villainous role; My Lai, Cambodia, and inflated body counts made that  pretty easy. Over the years, evidence of atrocities, the forced  collectivization of agriculture in the reunited South Vietnam, corruption  in the Communist Party leadership,  and grudging admission by NVA leaders  of high losses and military mistakes have made some question whether the  war was such a stark &quot;good guys v. bad guys&quot; conflict.  Of  course, questioning the assumption that the U.S. was on the wrong side in  Vietnam would seriously weaken the moral arguments of the antiwar leaders.   Is the former South Vietnam better off once the U.S. left?  If it is, why  did so manyleave after reunification, and why is the current Vietnamese  leadership so eager to welcome American capitalists?  On the other hand, if  it was important that we took a stand in South Vietnam, why didn't the U.S.  push the Diem and Thieu governments into real political and economic  reforms? The real study of the Vietnam War can only begin when historians  can set aside the need to prove a theory, and can look at what participants  really did and why they thought they had to do it.	1998-10-22

I know its not just me, as I have met other riders who just didn't find  this book the &quot;miracle&quot; that many have.  If visualization  techniques work for you, then by all means buy this as it is chock-full of  them.  Ms. Swift has had a lot of influence among riders and trainers, so  she does know horses and riders. However, don't feel stupid if Sally  doesn't do it for you!  Just as any given riding instructor is great for  some riders and the worst for others, the same is true with riding books.  The suggested exercises are helpful and the positive attitude is  appreciated, especially for those of us who have taken up riding as an  adult. However, if you find yourself struggling to understand one of Ms.  Swift's metaphors for riding, this may not be the book for you.  Best  advice : if you have a regular trainer, discuss the book with her (or him)  first.	1998-09-29

When reading some historians of ancient Greece and Rome, you get the sense  that they are impatient with those fool ancient writers.  Peter Green, in  this eminently entertaining and solidly-researched history of the campaigns  of Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea, treats Herodotus, Plutarch, Thucydides  and the rest as equals, giving them respect where merited and skepticism  where necessary.  Green, for some years a resident of Greece, is not afraid  to use more current history (political and military) to cast light upon  events and motivations of the past.  Where he has a good theory, he says  so; where he just doesn't know, he also says so.  One aspect of academic  writing endemic to ancient history is the criticism of other authors.   Green, thankfully, puts most of his in the notes. In doing so, he keeps the  story of the wars moving along, allowing the reader to appreciate the  effect of local politics on the course of both Greek and Persian strategy.  Unhesitantingly recommended to anyone with an interest in ancient Greek or  military history, and to students of national strategy.	1998-09-16

Dick Keresey's days as a PT commander in the Solomons in 1942 and 1943 are  the subject of this excellent memoir.  Told in a series of vignettes with a  loose narrative line, the book wraps up with a long account of a moral  choice made in the field that came back to him years later.  Keresey is  honest about himself, his men, and the Navy he served in.  Especially  insightful is his candid admission that what made him appear so calm in  combat was his &quot;cornered-rat&quot; impulse.  Finally, Keresey loved  those little boats, and he defends them against detractors who called them  &quot;expendable&quot; and &quot;made of balsa.&quot;  (He also defends  then Lt. John F. Kennedy for his actions in Blackett Strait when he sunk by  a Japanese destroyer.) This reviewer did wish that he had elaborated  somewhat more on the command arrangements of the PT forces, but this is  probably nitpicking.  A plea to the publisher : better maps and an index,  please!	1998-09-14

Author Dorrian tells the story of the raid to destroy the docks at St.  Nazaire so as to deny a berth to the German battleship TIRPITZ.  He  describes the strategic situation, outlines the plan, and gives some  background on the primary individuals involved before getting into a  highly-detailed account of the raid itself.  He gives full credit to the  crews of the British motor torpedo boats who found themselves in a  harrowing situation without having volunteered for it, unlike the  commandoes they were supporting.  Dorrian does not hesitate to criticize  the lack of support given to the raiding force by the Admiralty and the  RAF.  He also shows how the local French suffered as a result of the German  response to the raid, side effects that are often overlooked in glowing  accounts of World War Two special operations. Ultimately, the book shows  how a well-trained, highly-motivated military unit can achieve remarkable  success despite great difficulties. Highly recommended to anyone interested  in special operations or coastal defense.	1998-08-27

Motz draws upon many years of study in mythology and folklore to examine  how female dieties are represented in various traditional cultures (Baltic,  Germanic, Siberian, Near Eastern, Ancient Mexican, Japanese).  The result  is a complex view of goddesses as both creative and destructive, dominant  and subservient.  The first three chapters are given over to a critical  review of the purported ancient European &quot;Goddess Religion&quot; that  was supposedly swept aside by violent, patriarchical, storm-god worshipping  nomads.  Motz shows that the evidence for such a belief system is shaky and  subject to differing interpretation.  Not always an easy read due to a  rather academic writing style, &quot;Faces of the Goddess&quot; is very  rewarding.	1998-08-27

Professional soldiers may get more out of this than the general reader,  but close attention to the descriptions of the squad and platoon actions  are rewarding.  The importance of pre-planning, of coordinating different  weapons systems, and of  aggressive &quot;upfront&quot; leadership all come  through.  Another reviewer comments on the maps; yes, sometimes the text  references locations the reader can't find, but they may be due to an  inability of the authors to reconcile conflicting testimony between the  participants and the official records. Given how few maps show up in  military history books these days, I'd give the publisher a lot of credit  for their efforts here.  The style varies somewhat from section to section,  but not so much as to detract from the value of the book.	1998-08-27

Griffith critically examines the evidence on how and why the Vikings  fought, and finds much of it questionable.  The sagas aren't reliable,  sources are fantastic or biased, and physical remains are insufficient for  firm conclusions.  In short, he acts like a real historian in a period  where enthusiastic amateurs have set the standards. Overall, he finds a  mixed record of Norse military success, seeing them more as opportunistic  bandits than conquering warriors.  Given the persistance of Norse  &quot;kingdoms&quot; in some areas of Northern Europe, this conclusion is  far from proven.  Many readers would probably disagree with some (or most)  of his conclusions, but he does make you go back and look at the sources.

The naval actions around the Solomon Islands were a series of hard-fought  actions between two well-matched opponents.  The Japanese ability to fight  aggressively at night challenged the U.S. Navy.  Eventually, increased  tactical ability joined with an advantage in radar allowed the Americans to  defeat the Japanese, but as Crenshaw shows, it was not easy.  The pleasant  surprise in this book is the emphasis the author (a former gunnery officer  on the USS MAURY) puts on the effectiveness and use of weapons and fire  control systems.  His narrative flows, and shows the reader the many tasks  destroyers were called upon to do.  I don't get a real personal feel for  Mr. Crenshaw, to me the biggest drawback of an otherwise-admirable work.   Good set of maps! Recommended to those appreciating naval history, the  Pacific Campaigns in WW2, and destroyers.	1998-08-27

The decades of Motz's academic work in myth and folklore are on powerful  display.  In the first three chapters she critically undermines the  whole  notion of the ancient European &quot;Goddess Religion&quot; and points out  how this modern construct is a response to current social concerns.  The  bulk of the work is given over to an examination of the role of female  deities in various pre-modern cultures (Mexico, Siberia, Near East).  The  result is a richer and more complex understanding of the role of both  goddesses and women in these societies. The academic writing style is  better than that of many social scientists, and the included illustrations  are appreciated. Strongly recommended for those interested in myth,  folklore, or the social impact of theology.	1998-08-23

A well-researched and -written book on the British commando attack on the  docks in St. Nazaire, France, in March of 1942.  Dorrian points out the  risky nature of the raid, the limited support given to the raiding force by  the Admiralty and the Royal Air Force, and the incredible courage and  persistance of the commandos and sailors assigned to the mission.  Dorrian  also brings the French residents into the story, and shows how the German  occupiers took out their revenge on them.  Unlike many current military  history titles, the maps are useful! The two biggest drawbacks : as this  title was originally published in Great Britain, the author does not  explain his use of certain British military terms (e.g. &quot;O  group&quot;, &quot;pongo&quot;) and practically no research was done from  the German side.  Nonetheless, highly recommended to those interested in  the Second World War, special operations, or naval history.	1998-08-23

By focusing in on one particular unit of the Imperial Roman Army, Spiedel perhaps inadvertantly  points up how many historians of ancient military institutions squeeze a maximum of explanation from a minimum of sources.  The author uses words such as &quot;seems&quot;, &quot;assume&quot;, &quot;must have&quot; and &quot;probably&quot; rather frequently.  He is aware of the limitations of too much interpretation, though he seems too uncritical of most of his sources (he doesn't care for Dio Cassius though.)  Nonetheless, a solid attempt at understanding one element of the Roman military system.  For cavalry buffs, read this with Hyland's work on training the Roman cavalry.	1998-05-14

Pete Slosberg, the &quot;Pete&quot; of Pete's Wicked Ale, started as a homebrewer and became a craft or &quot;micro&quot; brewer.  This biography starts well, but ends up chatty and full of self-congratulatory anecdotes.  Slosberg has a good discussion of beer types and why brewers shouldn't worry too much about what category their beer is in.  Not much useful information on the business side of craft brewing.  Slosberg repeats a number of stories about beer origins and phrases, most of them reprinted in other books.  Definitely recommended for brewing aficionados.	1998-05-14

While the overall argument of this title is to show why Truman approved the use of the atomic bomb, Allen and Polmar also show the strengths and weaknesses of the grand strategies pursued by the U.S. and Japan during World War II.  The American failure to truly appreciate the massive national effort to defeat the Axis powers lead to a reliance on a bombing campaign to knock Japan out of the war, the apotheosis of which were the atomic bombs.  The Japanese expected to exhaust America through heroic sacrifice and terror weapons.  Code-name Downfall does a better job than most books on this period of the war in discussing the internal Japanese debate over surrender.  My main complaint is that the book fails to consider the possible success of the continued American submarine campaign against the Japanese merchant marine.  Nonetheless, highly recommended for all those interested in the Pacific campaigns in World War II and those debating the dropping of the atomic bomb.	1998-04-27

With an emphasis on the cocktail, Straight Up Or On The Rocks is a solid and entertaining history of drinking in America. Grimes' appreciation for a good cocktail is evident, and while he has his opinions on certain drinks, you understand why he has them.  This could be very useful for restuarant and bar professionals.  The drink recipe section in the back, while short, is very good.	1998-04-27

If you were looking for a book on whiskey, you could stop looking after you pick this up.  While the author is an Englishman, he appreciates fine spirits from around the world and writes about them gracefully.  Bourbons get their due as well as Lowland Scotch whiskies and Japanese brands rarely seen outside their native land.  The text is accompanied by many colr photographs; this could almost be a tourist guide. My recommendation  : buy this book (don't borrow it, you'll never return it), take it to a good liquor store, buy a whiskey that Mr Jackson likes, and drink it while rereading your favorite chapter.	1998-04-27
US	52422471	R3B5Y3FJMPZQK9	1574881809	41706538	Military Geography: For Professionals and the Public (Association of the United States Army S)	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Excellent introduction to a specialized topic.	If you are a serious reader of military history, a serving military professional, or a specialist in international security and defense issues, this book is worth your time.  As an introductory text, it covers many topics that are crucial to military planning but often receive only brief mention in histories or briefings.  Collins, a former Army officer, stresses land geography, but does not stint oceans, the atmosphere or interplanetary space.  His discussions of urban areas are too brief, given the increasing amount of large-scale violence in cities since the end of World War II.  More maps would also be an improvement.  Nonetheless, highly recommended.	1998-04-27
