US	52668768	R23VDSVNE4AO27	0441005837	937207660	Rose Daughter	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Another retelling	The beginning of this book was brilliant, in my opinion, and engaged my interest far more than Robin McKinley's original Beauty. I liked the better characterization of the sisters, the father and Beauty herself, and the world and events were far more fascinating. Where this book loses momentum is, strangely enough, when the plot gets going and Beauty meets the Beast. The scenes at the Beast's castle are incredibly slow, with large amounts of description and nothing much ever happening. The only times I felt a spark of interest again was when it returned to Jeweltongue and Lionheart, which surely shouldn't be right? The original Beauty was also quite a slow-moving book, but at least managed to track the development of the relationship between Beauty and the Beast in a believable and more interesting way. I preferred the ending of this book, of course, but found it didn't work after the poor setup. It's too hard to believe that they could fall in love in only seven days, during which they didn't even see much of each other.<br />I liked some of the gardening information in this book, but again, felt it was over-described, and was disappointed to see Beauty's love of books going out the window to make room for it. The descriptions of the roses worked at Rose Cottage, but not at the Beast's castle - there they just fell flat. Overall, this book had a much more fairytale feel to it than the original Beauty, but didn't tell the story nearly as economically as fairytales manage to do. In my opinion, you should read both Robin McKinley's retellings of this story, if you're interested - both have their flaws, and their strong points. Neither of them are going to be my favourite books.	2003-10-30

Basically, this book is a fantasy set in a Japanese-type world, dealing with warring between clans and a mysterious people called 'The Hidden'. It is told through the eyes of Takeo in first-person narration, and also includes chapters in third-person narrative about Kaede, a young girl.<br />To begin, I have to say I didn't think this book was the sensation that most people seem to. It was better than most of the fantasy books I have read, but then, most of them were pretty bad. The way the book is written is indeed good, fitting the setting of the book and including many interesting images and descriptions. I was fascinated by the idea of a 'nightingale floor.'<br />But that leads me onto one of my main problems with this book. The whole narrative appeared to be building up to Takeo crossing the nightingale floor, as would be implied by the title. Personally, I love challenges like that, so I was really looking forward to it. But when he finally did, he just ran across it easily and it was hardly even mentioned. I also found the many clans and their rivalries very confusing and couldn't keep them straight, which meant I didn't enjoy the book as much.<br />But my main problem has to be the characterisation. It wasn't so much flat as it was very hard to identify with the characters. I didn't find Takeo or Kaede's love story moving as I simply didn't identify very much with either of them. Takeo's character could have been explored more deeply through the first-person narrative, while Kaede's felt a bit shallow and she had several very fast changes of mind. The book didn't make me think and seemed to be almost all action and plot, which is fine for some people but I would like to see more depth in the characters and more interesting ideas.<br />Overall, it's quite a good read but only if you already like fantasy, it won't win anyone over to the genre in my opinion, and certainly isn't up to the standard of someone like Philip Pullman yet.	2003-07-22

Rather than updating it, the author has chosen to retell it in a fairy-tale style with more depth and substance.<br />I found this book difficult and almost boring to read in parts, but then there were brilliant patches where I couldn't put it down. I thought the beginning, when the magical country was described in such detail, was a bit of a mistake, although it was interesting. I would have preferred the characters to be introduced first and then the book to have moved onto a more detailed description of the scenery. I also didn't like that we had to see so much of the book from Katriona's point of view; I found her a boring and flat character and it was a relief to move onto Rosie.<br />Even though Rosie is the slightly stereotypical tomboy princess, I still liked her character and thought it was one of the strong points of this book. The characters around her are less well drawn - I would have liked to know more about Narl, and Peony annoyed me. By this point I'm wondering myself why I gave this book four stars - but it really is a wonderful read, most of the time, despite these shortcomings. My one big complaint which I can't overlook must be the ending. I found the final confrontation very tedious and wished it hadn't taken place it such an unreal setting. It jarred with the rest of the book. The author's take on the kiss is interesting and it was good to have a few twists near the end. However, I don't think the story should have been resolved in the way it was - it seemed too easy after all the run up. Peony is not the princess, whatever anyone says.<BR>I could have done without a lot of the animal stuff as well - as one reviewer said before, it reminded me far too much of Daine in Tamora Pierce's Immortals Quartet. I liked the idea of this being the gift that could save Rosie, however - another original twist.<br />Overall, this was beautifully written and had some really riveting parts, but was not without its boring patches and faults. It could have been slightly less predictable - near the end, one of the characters says 'But it is not a story, with the happy ending already written and waiting for us to turn the pages.' Yet it is, isn't it?	2003-06-20
US	52668768	RWTPZZXNNFLEK	0439507529	62377907	Martyn Pig	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Martyn Pig	I found this book to be well-written and interesting, but ultimately the plot was disappointing and certain aspects of the book let it down. The main character is Martyn Pig, obviously enough, whose problems start after the accidental death of his father. The plot promises a startling twist at the end, and I suppose it lives up to it. However, the way this twist is handled makes the reader feel cheated and the whole book seem slightly pointless. (And I'm not talking about the obvious twist. Read the last page more carefully if you don't get it) I felt that this revelation could have been built up to more carefully, with perhaps more of a suggestion of what was to come.<br />Martyn himself was an well-rounded character, but I personally found Alex, the other main character, a bit flat and stereotyped. There was a lot of space devoted to describing Martyn's thoughts, which was mostly a good thing, but in the scene at the beach this made the plot drag a bit. Overall, this isn't a book I would recommend exactly, but it was far better than I expected it to be and you find yourself thinking about it for quite a while afterwards.	2003-06-07

I think the main problems with it were the lack of strong characters and of a good ending. Instead of having an exciting final showdown, everything was over far too quickly, especially with the many scenes that had gone before to reach this point. Although the author had invented an intresting fantasy world I didn't really find it believable or solid, and at times it seemed she was just tossing in exotic-sounding names to make it seem more fantastical.<br />I thought the characters of Sara and Dorjan were very dull and two-dimensional. In contrast, Maeve and Jasper were slightly more intresting but I felt they could have been more developed. The book could have been shorter and more compact, which would hopefully have made it more tense and exciting. It took me much longer to read this book that it would to read a book this length normally because I simply didn't want to pick it up.<br />However, I disagree with the people who said there should have been more about Torina and Landen; they weren't central characters in this book. Their story, 'The Seer and the Sword' is a lot better than 'The Healer's Keep' and I would recommend not to read this one at all, unless you really love fantasy, which I don't.	2003-02-10

This is the last part of a trilogy (the first two books are 'Sabriel' and 'Lirael') and as much, you should definitely read the first two books before reading this one, otherwise it might get quite confusing. This story begins directly after 'Lireal' ends. Lireal and Sam are still trying to stop Hedge's plans coming to fruition, with the help of the Disreputable Dog and Mogget.<BR>Although not my favourite book of the trilogy (I like 'Lirael' best, especially the first eight or so chapters of it) 'Abhorsen' was still excellent. There was lots of action and a very dramatic ending. I thought that it was intresting seeing deeper into Death, with more detailed descriptions of the precints than there were in 'Sabriel'. The plot wasn't confusing and I was glad to see that Nicholas, my favourite character, appeared a lot more. Overall a very good read and a great series for anyone, whether you like fantasy or not. I don't usually read fantasy but I loved these books. <br />I hope that Nix will write some more about this world, because there seems to be a whole lot of material left to explore. (I'd love to know more about the Wallmakers and the Clayr, for a start).	2003-01-23

I liked Sarah and Frances's stories, but found they still became boring in parts, and didn't really like Julia's at all. This was easily the most touching and sad of the books, and I think, the most well written.<BR>Unlike the other books, this one doesn't have much about the First World War in it, instead concentrating on Gwen's later life. I expected this to make the book boring, but it doesn't. Instead it makes it far more realistic and original. (The reason I didn't really like Julia's book so much was because it was the typical 'war story' and the characters were boring.) Gwen, although she fades into the background in the other books, is actually a very interesting character and I like Antony the best of the Mackensie brothers. <BR>This whole quartet is great for anyone who likes historical fiction, though I advise reading them in order (I didn't) otherwise you can get a bit confused.	2002-12-03

But 'Rilla of Ingleside', which you can't really count as an 'Anne book' as Anne is hardly in it, comes very close to being my favourite L.M Montgomery book ever (can't choose between it and 'Emily's Quest')<BR>This book is about Anne's youngest daughter Rilla, and how she is forced to grow up during the years of the First World War. Many boys she knows go off to fight, and the worry and the grief their families feel over them is the best part of this book. It is much sadder than the other Anne books, which is probably why I like it, but there are some funny bits as well (as in, most of the time Susan appears!)<BR>Many of the characters introduced in earlier Anne books do not appear in this book, which is a bit annoying, but explainable, as Anne has so many friends and aquiantances that L.M Montgomery couldn't possibly write about them all. And most of the interesting ones do at least get a mention. Most of the children from 'Rainbow Valley' are also pushed into the background in this book, except Rilla and Walter. I didn't mind much about this, as I found most of the children (Anne's and the Merediths) quite boring, but I would have liked to see more about Una and Carl Meredith.<BR>This book stands on its own, but it would be a good thing to at least read 'Rainbow Valley' first, otherwise all the characters might get a bit confusing. Even if you didn't like the other Anne books, read this, as it is very different and not so cheerful all the time. I prefer depressing books.	2002-10-25

All the battles at the beginning dragged a bit, and I wanted to see more stuff with the characters (not just romance, though that would have been good, but Kel just having time with her friends like she did in the first two books) This book picked up a lot by the second half, though, once it got past all that strategy stuff which I found a bit boring, and it had one very good point: Neal was in it. He's been my favourite character from the very beginning and I was disappointed when he was hardly in Squire. Even though he was betrothed to Yukimi and all that, I was still hoping he would go out with Kel some time. Oh well... <BR>I have suspicions that at some future book set in Tortall, Kel and Dom will make an appearance as a couple, which would be fun. :)<BR>It may be a slight let-down after the other three, but Lady Knight is still a good book and this quartet is definitely my favourite out of all that Tamora Pierce is written. I agree with the other reviewers - you can't really imagine being Alanna or Daine (or any of the people in Circle of Magic who have magic and that) but Kel is an ordinary girl you can identify with.	2002-10-22

The problem with several of the other books is they always seemed to have one part where they lagged a little, but not so with this book. I was glad to see the Drews return in this book, because I always liked the books with them in better then the two which they aren't in('The Dark Is Rising' and 'The Grey King'.) Will is my favourite character, though.<BR>In this book, some of the best parts are those involving the Greenwitch, especially the ceremony on the beach, and I also liked how the characters of the Drews were developed more in this book, especially Jane. In 'Over Sea, Under Stone' they were a little two-dimensional, and like another reviewer said, a bit like some of E. Nesbit's characters!<BR>Anyway, I recommend this sequence of books and especially this one to anyone who likes fantasy, they are really good and the kind of books you can read again and again. I still think that Susan Cooper's best book is 'King of Shadows', though.	2002-08-19

The beginning and end parts were intresting, but in the middle it started to drag a lot, and got very boring for a while. The plot, at least until the last few chapters, seemed to be much the same style as 'Fire Bringer' which I enjoyed more. The plot centres around the mystic power 'the Sight' which a few of the wolves have, which gives them many special abilities. Some of the characters in this book were intresting, especially Kar, and I would have liked to hear a little more about them rather than the plot. This book seemed to be focused on giving a message, rather then concentrating on the characters, and this is why I didn't like it very much. Larka, especially, seemed to be just used as a vessel for the message the author wanted to put across.<br />I enjoyed 'Fire Bringer' more than this book, but although they were well-written, neither of them seemed to be very orginial, and were pretty predictable. And considering the number of people who disagree, I expect lots of people will vote this review 'unhelpful'. Well, it's only my opinion.	2002-08-16

I enjoyed this book as it was a good story and left me wanting to know what happened next, but I didn't like how it mixed the real information about Wicca in with the Seven Great Clans fiction. I thought this would be quite confusing to people who didn't know much about Wicca, also I don't like the idea that there are certain people 'selected,' to be witches. I prefer the 'Circle of Three,' series to this, it is quite similar but more realistic and you can identify with the characters more.<BR> However, I liked this book and am looking forward to reading #2.	2002-03-07

I really can't decide which is my favourite book out of this brilliant trilogy, but I think I'd say this one simply because its the ending, which is always going to be good. I'm glad that Cassie and Adam stayed together-it was clear from the start she was never going to go with Nick. Although I liked Nick's character he wasn't anywhere near as intresting as some of the other 'bad-boy' characters L.J Smith has written about (eg Julian, for anyone who's read The Forbidden Game trilogy) This book brought the Secret Circle trilogy to a great close, although it did still leave some loose ends, which made it more realistic in a way. I liked all the details given about the stones and I loved the candle ceremony the girls did.<BR>One more thing-why on earth have some people said they think Diana and Nick will get together?? That would never happen! The Secret Circle trilogy are some of my favourites of L.J Smith's books and I reccommend them to anyone (but make sure you read them in order or it ruins the later ones)	2002-02-19

Lireal, as said in the title, is a Daughter of the Clayr, but is the only one without the magical gift of the Sight. The other main character in this book is Prince Sameth, son of Sabriel and Touchstone. <br />This book picks up roughly fourteen or fifteen years after Sabriel ended. (BTW, you should definitely read Sabriel first. Without it, the surprises revealed in this book aren't half so..surprising!) I found Part One to be the most intresting, Lireal's adventures in the Clayr's Glacier kept me reading non-stop! The books action slowed down a bit, however, when it came to the parts dealing with Prince Sameth. Sam's story was intresting, but compared to the brilliance of Lireal's story, I was left reading quickly through Sam's chapters to find out what happened next to Lireal.<br />This book leaves many loose ends, which I don't mind-at least it means there's a 3rd book coming! I guessed the surprise about Lireal's birth( I won't write what it is so as not to spoil it) as soon as she found the pipes and it was revealed Sam didn't want to be the Abhorsen-it was obvious! I was then waiting through the rest of the book for Lireal to find out and was satisfied when she finally did at the end.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who even enjoys fantasy sometimes. Along with Sabriel, it is one of the best fantasy books I've read.	2002-01-18

Although good, I probably wouldn't have found this book very intresting if I hadn't read the Giver first; read after reading The Giver its much better. The storyline was quite simple, and more predictable then the Giver(I cant help comparing the two-they're so alike!) and although the future world described in Gathering Blue was harsh, the one in the Giver was far more chilling and therefore more intresting to read about. One thing I picked up on-its intresting how this book is based so much around colours, while the Giver is about a world with no colors at all, until Jonas learns to see them. (talking of him, did anyone pick up the reference at the end, about the boy with blue eyes? When an author puts in an insignifcant detail like that its got to be for a reason.) Anyway, I recommend reading the Giver first and then Gathering Blue, otherwise you might be disappointed.	2001-12-10

I love all the Forbidden Game Trilogy, but after re-reading them recently, I decided if I had to pick a favourite, this has to be it. #1 had the most intresting game and I guess the best plot, but this one win because it had all the best parts about Julian!(my favourite character.) Like a lot of L.J Smith's books, this sounds like a typical teen horror/romance novel, but it really isn't. In this last part of the trilogy, Jenny and her friends return to the Shadow World to rescue others left behind, and of course, meet Julian again, the evil (??) Shadow Man in love with Jenny. I found the ending to be perfect, though sad, and wouldn't want another book in this trilogy. Although I liked Julian SO much more then Tom,(Tom was the least developed main character in it!) (spoiler) I love this book and this trilogy, I really recommend them and also the 'Night World,' series by L.J Smith, though they aren't quite as good.	2001-11-03

Juniper is a more intresting character with a better story line. She begins her story as a Cornish princess who begins to learn the ways of the dorans through her godmother,Euny. I especially liked the parts of the books with Angherhad and Trewyn, with Juniper making her doran's cloak and at last beginning to understand more about magic. Although this is the better book, I would still recommend you read Wise Child first, as it makes it more of a surprise when characters from there come up in Juniper.

I have one complaint: Cleon. ....<br />Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.)

But if the rest of the books continue to be as good as this, Remnants will be a brilliant series. Its a much darker series then Animorphs from the very start, and the scenes near the end are very powerful. The idea behind the series is that eighty people- The Eighty- escape a doomed Earth to try to keep some part of the human race alive. Several characters are introduced as the countdown begins to the destruction of Earth. The book may seem to have a simple plot, but its actually full of surprises, and some parts like Cordelia's death, are very moving- up until then, I was still hoping she'd be able to get on the Mayflower shuttle some day. And the end of the book, with the sample chapter for Remnants #2, left me wanting to read more. Definitely a great book, whether you're a fan of Animorphs or not.	2001-06-24

The Redwall books have been getting quite similar lately, so I thought this book by Brian Jacques, written outside the Redwall series, would make a change. But I was wrong. Its getting boring how all of Jacques' books follow the same plot.There is always some cryptic puzzle to solve, the plots are predictable, and the characters aren't memorable. This one actually starts off better then most with the scenes onboard The Flying Dutchman, but quickly becomes boring. Brian Jaques has already written too many similar books- I wish he would write something completly different, like one of his earliest books, Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales. For now, all I can say is skip this one, and if you're looking for a real plot and some surprises and good writing, read Robin Jarvis' books.

The book started in an intresting way, which made you want to read more, as it begun in the middle of the story and then went back and described what happened before. The first half of this book was brilliant, I loved the world of the Seventh Tower, and the Sunstones and Achievments etc. A really imaginative new world was created. The only time this book began to drag was when Tal, the main character, fell from the Seventh Tower into an icy waste, where he meets Milla, who is hoping to become a Shield Maiden. This part was still good, but not as enjoyable or imaginative as the rest of the book. Still, I wasn't disappointed. This book is a great start to the Seventh Tower series.	2001-05-17

After that, some of the suspense is lowered. But it really blows you away. This is one of the few books I have not been able to put down. Jake's character changes completely, but it is a change that is needed to win the war against the Yeerks. One of my favourite parts in this book was when Jake talks to the Taxxons. I was really glad to see the return of Arbron, as he seemed to have been forgotten after The Andalite Chronicles. You must at least read the others in the ten part mini-series before you read this, but once you do it's a brilliant run-up, along with The Sacrifice, to the conclusion of this series. (The ending of this book is infuriating! I just wanted to grab The Beginning right away!) The end is near....	2001-05-06

This book was so much better then the previous one in the series, 'The Absolute.' at last there was a book with few battles and more time for people's characters to come out. This book followed on well from the last Ax book, with Ax still wondering where he stands with the Animorphs and what path he should choose to follow. At first it seems like he is going to go with the Andalites, but his views change throughout the book. There were some intresting views on Cassie and Rachel in this book. Tobias also seemed to be back in character. He has been a little off in previous books. This book is extremely powerful and moving. You could see how hard the choice was to make, but I thought their decision was the right one, in the end. None of the Animorphs were unlikeable in this book by the end. One of the best in the series, surprising for one of the last books. I hope the last one is this good.	2001-04-09

Some more recent ones haven't been very good ( Lord Brocktree, especially) but this one is. The story starts off slowly with Martin journeying to find out what happened to Luke the Warrior, his father. it really gets going once it gets into the second part. The best part of this story is finding out more about Martin. The earlier books in the redwall series have always been my favourites. Next I hope Brian Jacques will write a book about Martin which ends with him hanging up his sword, and also one about Loamhedge. If you want to read this book, I advise reading Martin the warrior and Mossflower first, as they come before it, though they aren't written in chronological order.	2001-04-02

It's very different but good in its own way. I would have to say this book is the best in the Switchers trilogy. The way Kate Thompson writes bring you into the story. The book doesn't get boring but never seems too rushed, either. The two main characters in this book are Kevin and Tess, two Switchers who have the power to 'switch' into any creature they can imagine. They are just beginning to learn how to use their powers to the full extent. The other two books in the series are Midnight's Choice ( almost as good as this one) and Wild Blood ( nowhere near.) And I know I said they're nothing like Animorphs, but anyone who has read 48-The Return and Midnight's Choice will notice some strange similarities.	2001-02-04

I was worried about what the ten-book mini-series was going to be like after reading no 45, which wasn't half as good as I expected it to be. But this book was a huge improvement. There was a lot of fighting, but somehow it seemed to return to the quality of the old Animorph books, even though it was short. Ax's previous books have made me dislike him slightly; he seemed more and more arrogant. This book has changed my mind about him, showing why he has always been so careful before to not interfere in human matters, and the terrible choice he had to make. The ending was brillant and echoed parts of the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, especially. The book didn't change so much from the-war-with-the-Yeeks point of view, but it changed Ax's friendship with the Animorphs completely. One of the best Ax books recently!	2001-01-31

Once you've read about three of them you get to realize that the plots are very similar. Redwall was good, that doesn't mean he has to write 12 more! All featuring annoying mice who always win against the rats never losing a important character or even taking many casualties. It's all white and black with no sublety. and these books are so famous? You should read Robin Jarvis's books, who I notice are now being marketed as 'in the tradition of Redwall' although they were published before most of the Redwall books!

By the end of the book everything for Marco is changed. If the books are going on like this, things will get out of control. I thought this book was too short and a bit rushed. Good that things are changing, bad that everything is changing at once. There was a lot of action, but it didn't stick in your head. I wouldn't call it one of the Animorphs that stand out, though I thought it would be. I hope the next ones are better then this- I think they will be. Also, parts of the plot didn't really hang together, like their big mission to the Yeerk pool. Wasn't the whole point to rescue Visser One ( the yeerk) and Marco's mother, so Visser Three doesn't end up launching a full scale invasion of Earth? But Marco kills the Yeerk. Maybe I should read that bit again. This could have been a great book, but it wasn't. That's about it.	2001-01-15

The plot was quite predictable and I didn't really like the characters, especially Ian who I didn't like at all, because he was so religious and always going on about God, which didn't really mean anything. Heather was also a very flat character. The plot was good but the bad characters spoiled it. However, the sequel is much better and I could identify with Amber much more then with Heather, so you could just skip this one. You won't be missing much.	2000-12-30

After reading some of her other brilliant books, such as Stranger With My Face, it was a letdown. The story is about a girl called Nancy with special psychic powers, given to her by her dying grandmother when she was a child, and what happens to her and her sister and brother. The story seemed too young and simple for me, and with her other books, I thought could be enjoyed by almost any age. I also have read them over and over again. This is an okay book, but compared to her others, it falls flat. Read it, forget about it.	2000-12-02

The books can be read on their own, but it's better to read them in order as you gradually find out about the mystery of Amy's past. In this book Amy goes to New York to compete in the finals of an essay competition. But after she faints and ends up in hospital, she discovers there may be another reason she's in New York.. What I like about these book is all sorts of clues are put it, and they all end up tying in with the mystery at the end but not in the way you expected. I didn't like the ending of this book, though. I hope she does find out it was real or the book is pretty pointless.	2000-11-29

It is one of the best Sweet Valley University Thrillers I've read. It starts off normal, the twins and their friends getting ready for a party. But when most of the guests disappear, the party turns into a nightmare. Near the end this book becomes literally unputdownable. I was scared myself when Lila was trying to hide in the secret safe-it was so nerveracking! The ending was a letdown, but I think it had to happen or the book couldn't have been as tense without being totally unrealistic. I warn you not to buy this book. ( Sorry, Amazon!)It's great the first time round, not so good the next time because you know what is going to happen. But read it.	2000-11-29

But it was a lot better then I thought. The beginning was boring ( and why don't they start with 'My name is..' anymore) but the book picks up after Cassie wakes up on a plane heading to Australia. The other Animorphs have no idea where she's gone, and though she manages to escape from the clutches of Controllers, she's stranded in the Australian outback. My favourite parts of this book were when she met Yami, who I guess is an Aboriginal Australian...and almost cheats on Jake! I think, like another reviewer said, that Cassie's attitude will change now and she will realize sometimes you have to do bad things to prevent worse from happening.	2000-11-21

Even though I knew some things about this book already because I read She Died too Young first by mistake, it didn't spoil this book which is my favourite of all of Lurlene McDaniel's books. It was slightly different from her otheras because it was longer, which was good as it gave you more time to get into the story.It follows the story of Jenny and Richard, starting just before Jenny is diagnosed with leukiema. This book has a very sad ending, but you are made to see that their is still hope left in Jenny's legacy of One Last Wish and Jenny House. It has also made me look at the other books in the series in a different way, the letter seems to mean more, for example. I think this is a book that lots of different people could like and I defintely recommend it.	2000-11-01

This definetly ranks in my best Animorphs books, not quite up there with #3,#31 and #33, my all-time favourites but close. Tobias is my favourite character and I always enjoy his books.

This book is mostly about the Animorphs on the run from the Yeerks who have activated the Helmacron's morph-finding device. When I first started this book I thought I wouldn't like it as it sounded a bit like #24, another Cassie book which I hated. But the other main plot in this book was about a buffalo accidently getting the power to morph and morphing into Chapman several times. It was very intresting and touching in some parts seeing a buffaflo trying to deal with a human form. I didn't like the bufflflo dying though since I had hoped for a happier ending for it. The book seemed to end too quickly after that. One thing I found strange though was Cassie's attitude towards the ant which had accquired her. She was very sympathetic towards the buffalo but after seeing the ant her first reaction was just 'kill it' which she did and never had any afterthoughts. The ant didn't know what was going on any more then the buffalo did. That didn't seem in the character of Cassie. This is one of the best recent Animorphs books, definetly better then #40 and #41 and also an improvement on #38. I advise you to read it if you like Animorphs.	2000-09-30

Melissa Austin is only sixteen years old but she has leaukiema. This book descibes how she faces her future, goes through chemo, and ultimatly achieves remission. I could really identify with Melissa in this story, what she was going through and how it made her feel which made the book much more powerful. As Melissa is fighting her disease her best friend Jory helps her all the way.  This book is quite sad, but not as much as its sequel, Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever. However, I think this is the better of the two. Maybe because the sequel is told more around the point of view of Jory, and I like Melissa better. Anyway, I reccommend this book to anyone.	2000-09-28

She is adopted and is forced to search for her birth mother after she learns she desperatly needs a bone marrow transplant.

Most of the book focuses around Leah and Ethan's romance and the sudden sad ending just seems contrived. I found it almost boring in places. The third and final book of this trilogy is better, but Angels Watching Over Me is definetly the best and also unluckily the shortest.

The other three were not very intresting or with very  imaginative characters and ideas, especially Tehanu, which seemed to have  no plot at all. I don't like the Earthsea series very much because women  don't play much part in it as they can't be wizards, so it was good in this  one to have a main character who's female. It drew me in right away with  the descriptions of the strange rituals and religion surrounding Tenar's  life. I don't think it was slow to start. It might be best to read 'A  Wizard of Earthsea.' first to be introduced to Ged and the world of  Earthsea, but don't be put off if you don't like it that much, give this  one a try.	2000-09-05

I had  to perservere to finish it, as it didn't really keep your attention. The  characters Rialle and her friend weren't very memorable.

It's one of the best in the Sweet Valley University series so far, focusing mainly on how Jessica deals with  thinking her boyfriend, Nick Fox is dead. It has a brillant ending which is  very sad, when Jessica finally meets her 'guardian angel.' It also shows  how Elizabeth deals with her problems with Tom as well as with her sister's  depression. It's very realistic with lots of plot strands woven through the  book. There's just one thing that stops it getting five stars- Dana and  Todd! Those two as a couple is just ridiculious.

But this was just full of crazy and unbelievable things  just to make the plot more intresting, though it in fact makes it boring.  All the characters were nothing like themselves, except for Elizabeth,  Jessica and Ryan who together make the only good plot in this book. This  book and the next one feel as if the other sub-plots are just there to make  the book longer, especially the plot with Stu and Nina, which is just too  weird.

I think the 'Melissa'  mentioned was Melissa Chapman,I wonder how she got into the Animorphs?  Well, anyway this book had a great start and some good scenes at the Battle  of Agincourt, I liked the bit with Tobias in the church. But then the book  sort of went downhill with battle after battle. It seemed to just be the  same old thing, and a lot of the information was hard to take in all at  once for example where all the Animorphs were. The ending improves this  book which I thought was a clever solution to the problem, so Jake didn't  'come back to life', he was never dead. It was pretty enjoyable,  fast-moving with plenty of action. Still, it wasn't the best Megamorphs. I  prefer #1 or #2. Its got a nice cover, though Tobias looks wrong.

This book has a very strange plot and  introduces a new class of aliens, the Helmacrons which aren't that  intresting. Some parts were okay, like when the Helmacrons shrunk Visser 3.  I also liked the Helmacron log entries, they were funny. But Cassie seemed  to be acting out of character, especially after no 19. This is a book I'll  probably only read once or twice.

If you like football, you would probably love this book, which  is a mystery set around a football team, Radwick Rangers when someone is  murdering the players. There are too many characters to keep track of at  first until you sort them out into unimportant and important. Anyway, it  was okay but I recommend something like 'Dying For You' more if you're not  intrested in football.	2000-08-12

There was something about this book that made me want to read it over and over again. I liked all the  scenes with Salvador,Anna and Elizabeth and I thought their magazine pieces  at the end of the chapters were very funny, especially Elizabeth's about  school bus manners and Salvador's school uniforms. I did think Jessica was  acting a bit out of character though when she became friends with Bethel.  Bethel seems more like someone Elizabeth would be friends with. You should  read the first two books in the series first before buying this book, it  makes it more enjoyable.	2000-08-12
US	52668768	R3DQPGAUNCG9GX	0688154921	935348000	The Time of the Ghost	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Confusing, but it gets better	I found this book very hard to start as it was very mysterious and hard to keep track of the characters, and the ghost, who at first has no name. Once  I got about halfway through I enjoyed it a lot more as the story became  more exciting and the ghost's mission became clear. I thought the four  sisters were very intresting characters and in parts the book was quite  sinister and chilling. It's not my favourite book, and you have to be quite  a good reader to keep on with it but it does improve as you go on.	2000-08-11

Basically it is about a girl called  Ashleigh who moves to an old house and finds a doll in the garden. Later  she finds out the doll belongs to Louisa, a sick child. It has quite a good  ending but it wasn't a page-turner. 'Wait Till Helen Comes' by the same  author is much more spooky and interesting and though they are for the same  age group, I think older people would enjoy 'Wait Till Helen Comes' better  then 'The Doll In the Garden', which I read when I was 12 and I thought too  young for me. People ten and under would probably like it better.	2000-08-11

I love every single one of her books, and I can't say that about  any other author. Stranger With My Face was the first one I read. On the  back, it sounded like an easy read, like Point Horror or something but it  was nothing of the kind. The story of Laurie and Lia is unforgettable and  will linger in your mind for a long time. It is a very thought-provoking  book and one I have read over and over again. One thing I really like in  this book is the 'Eternity' quotation, I can't remember it all but that  quotation made me think. Read this book, that is all I can say. You should  definitely read this book.	2000-08-11

It is about another universe where in the modern day, witches are still burned and is set at a boarding  school called Larwood House where a lot of the children are  'witch-orphans'. It has an unusual plot and is a good read, but one thing  which spoiled it for me is I didn't really like or identify with any of the  characters. Charles Morgan was probably my favourite character. Lots of  other people who have reviewed this have compared it with Harry Potter, I  read this book before I read Harry Potter and don't think they are much  alike at all. I prefer Harry Potter, however but I would recommend this  book to people who like fantasy stories about magic, and other Harry Potter  fans would probably enjoy it.	2000-08-11

Every person in the story comes vividly alive and even minor characters such as  policemen and firemen have their own personalites. The separate story of  each person unfold as the 'Golden Hour' runs out.. Definitely a book you  can't put down as the constant changing from character to character left  you hanging on what was going to happen next to each of them. This book is  sad in some parts, exciting in others, dramatic in others and I recommend  it to people 12 and up. It is my favourite Caroline B. Cooney book. My only  complaint is it ends too quickly and some of the stories don't seem quite  finished. I want to know what happens next!	2000-08-11

The quote above is from the review on the back of the book but I totally  agree with it. There is something about this book that just makes me want  to read it again and again.. Bascially, it starts off with these two girls,  Tracy and Mandy, who are penpals. It's a good start but not exactly  inspiring. But read a little further and it starts getting good. One thing  I really like is the story Tracy writes about her Nanna, that is very  touching and sad. This is probably a book for people over 13 or 14 as it is  quite difficult, in parts.	2000-08-11

David and Kim as very realistic  characters and it also taught me a lot more about some illnesses which I  didn't know a lot about. I recommend this book especially to fans of  Lurlene McDaniel as its a bit like some of her books.	2000-08-10

Jessica is  one of my favourite characters and I liked Jeremy because often these books  just focus on the person with the disease and their boyfriends and friends  are just in the background. After Jeremy decided to donate his kidney to  Jessica, he was a very big part of this book and a lot of parts were told  from his point of view. I could guess most of the plot, but some parts were  surprising and I really identified with the characters making Saving  Jessica one of the most touching and sympathetic books I have read. I  advise you to get it if you liked Somewhere Between Life and Death or other  Lurlene McDaniel books.	2000-08-09
US	52668768	R19J4DDMCMCXHO	0140386270	411821001	Vampire Heart	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Three stories in one...	This book is mostly about Ella and Alex, two vampires and what happens to them. It's not as good as some books I've read about the same subject, like  Night World, but it's pretty good and I really liked the vivid  descriptions, when you could almost see what was being described. This book  is three short books in one, my favourite was the second book which is the  story of how Ella first got made into a vampire switching back and forth  with what's happening to her now. This book was also similar to the Night  World books as it seemed to also feature soulmates, though they weren't  called soulmates. A intresting new idea was instead of the vampires just  being immortal, they could take on new bodies and new identities. I don't  know why this book is rated 4-8 as it is definitely a teenage book. I  reccommend it to anyone who likes books about vampires and readers of L.J  Smith's Night World especially.	2000-08-09

The fanasty world of the first two seemed to have turned  into a science fiction universe which was boring and unimaginative. The  story was hard to follow and it was very annoying having Dairine as the  main character as I never liked her and didn't want her to become a wizard.  Rather then this bad end to a good trilogy I would prefer to think of So  You Want to Be a Wizard and Deep Wizardry as a book and its sequel. The  only reason I finished this book is because I wanted to read the whole  trilogy-otherwise, it just wasn't intresting.	2000-08-09

But this book was definetly bad. It was just the same old  thing over and over again, action, action who cares? It did have a few good  parts though. The ending was good and a big improvement on the rest of the  book. It also showed you what happens when Rachel gets out of control, but  didn't we already see that in #32? One thing I did like about this book was  the cover.	2000-08-08

It focused on Visser One, switching between her  trial at the Council of Thirteen and her memories of finding Earth. as it  was set amoung Earth and the human world, it wasn't as intresting as the  other two, which were about Hork-Bajir and Andalites. The bits with the  Council of thirteen, in my opinion were better then the rest of the story  as I'd been wondering about this for ages. It was O.K, but had nothing  special about it, no revelations like The andalite Chronicles or moral  issues like The Hork-Bajir Chroncicles. If you're a big Animorphs fan, get  this, though you'll probably only read it once or twice- which makes it  annoying it's a hardback as my copy of the Andalite Chronicles is falling  apart- I'd rather that had been a hardback. Though the holographic cover is  cool.	2000-08-08

As  soon as I had finished it I wanted to read the next two books. It makes a  welcome change from the last two 'Lifeguard' summer trilogys to have this  one set in New York where Elizabeth and Tom are on holidays and Elizabeth  directs a play she's written. There is also a separate story about  Jessica's experiences in a security guard training camp, which I found  funny. Get it if you like SVU but are sick of lifeguards!	2000-08-08

It is narrated by my  favourite character, Tobias and in this book the focus isn't so much on  action, action, action but more with his thoughts, feelings and memories.  Basically, Tobias is captured on purpose so they can make the eerks think  the Anti-Morphing Ray doesn't work. Then he is tortured by a Controller  called Taylor with a switch that moves from pleasure to pain. This part  takes up most of the book but is fascinating because you see parts of  Tobias' human life which have never been revealed before. I also liked the  bit near the end when Taylor goes a bit crazy. By the way, everyone is  saying that in this book is Tobias' and Rachel's first kiss but I thought  that was in Megamorphs 3.Which comes first?	2000-08-08

I found all the characters  really touching and believable- Todd, who's being torn in two, Elizabeth,  who has to make a sacifice and Gin-Yung, who's having the hardest time of  all.. It was great to see Todd and Elizabeth back together again, which was  romantic and the bits about Gin-Yung dealing with her fatal illness were  very touching. Jessica's parts didn't add much to the story, still they  broke it up nicely and left you wondering what was going to happen next  between Todd, Elizabeth and Gin-Yung. Don't miss this one if you like SVU!	2000-08-08

Jez Redfern is the main character, and the story is about what happens  to her when she turns from a vampire gang leader into a vampire hunter  after discovering she's half human. This is the first of the 'Wild Power'  Night World books. In this one, Jez has to search for a Wild Power and to  do so has to rejoin her old gang who have evidence of a sighting of one.  This book has a great surprise ending and Jez is a brillant character who  really comes alive. The only thing I don't like is her soulmate, Morgread.  He doesn't suit her. The poem which ends this book also ends the other  'Wild Power' books in this series: One from the land of kings long  forgotten, One from the hearth which still holds a spark, One from the Day  World where two eyes are watching, One from the twilight to be one with the  dark.	2000-08-08

It reveals some bits of Tobias' pre-animorphs life, which was very intresting. I liked it because it wasn't a big battle book, it focused more on his feelings and thoughts and was very different from most Animorphs. The basic  story is they are trying to make Visser 3 think his Anti-Morphing ray  doesn't work so Tobias has to volunteer to be captured. When he is captured  he is tortured, which is where the flashbacks part comes in, this part  takes up most of the book.  A lot of people were really pleased someone  morphed Ax, but in my opinion this book didn't actually need that scene, it  would have been great anyway. I can't choose between #3 and this one now as  the best Animorphs.	2000-07-26

THey might sound a little similar, but #30 and this one are nothing alike! This book was really intresting and moving. I liked it because it didn't have really big and boring battles, and was much more subtle and undercover. I thought  the animorphs thought of some really intresting plots in this one, instead  of just doing the same old thing. Jake's grandpa's death was woven into the  story, with comparisons between the battles that his granpa was in and the  battle Jake's fighting now, instead of just being there to make the plot  work.

I would reccommend this book to anyone as i  think there is something for everyone in it.	2000-01-08

It was hard to keep track of what was happening and it was really unrealastic. Don't buy this book or Dawn diary 2 but all the other california diaries are really good.	1999-12-15

Also the ending was a bit of a let-down, I hoped dawn and sunny would become friends again even if it doesn't always turn out that way in real life. It was quite good but Sunny-Diary Two is better.	1999-12-15

I like the Animorphs series but prefer the megamorphs and the chronclies because the other boooks are too short. The andalite chronclies is brillant, but you should definetly read at least one  animorphs book before reading it because otherwise you won't understand it  and the surprises will be ruined.	1999-12-15
US	52668768	RQ09N9KBJOGPB	0439070341	917493272	The Prophecy (Animorphs #34)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	The Prophecy	I guess this book was good, but I found it really hard to understand as I hadn't read thev Hork bajir chronclies first. All the book was about stuff which happened in that. it seemed to end too soon,there should have been a bit about cassie at the end. but still a good animorph book, though you  should read the hork bajir chronicles first.	1999-12-11

At the end of it you end up feeling like stacey does and really sympathizing with her. At the end you also feel like kristy and dawn are really immature.	1999-06-26
