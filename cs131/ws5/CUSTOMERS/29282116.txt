Eager to see if the legend is true, horror writer David Masters moves onto the estate with his teenage daughter Amber to write his latest book about the house.  Given this rather basic premise author Tamara Thorne then lets her imagination run wild and pulls every trick in the book to keep the reader at the edge of their seat -- seances, cold spots, daggers, dungeons, possession, a cult, succubi, a headless ghost, an abandoned lighthouse, bloody dolls, a torture chamber...  HAUNTED is wonderfully atmospheric and grips the reader from the start, holding them fast, and maintaining a solid momentum throughout this juicy, and nearly 500-page, tale of possession and evil from beyond the grave.  A spooky and sexy epic.  Lots of fun for those who crave a good scare before bedtime.	2005-06-09

Terry Wolverton's debut novel, BAILEY'S BEADS, is one of the most extraordinary and engrossing books I've read in some time.  This moving, wise, and provocative novel is the story of Bryn Redding, a Los Angeles writer who lies comatose following an auto accident.  At her bedside are Bryn's lover (Djuna) as well as Bryn's mother (Vera) and through their alternating points of view the reader soon comes to discover that Bryn is not quite the person either of the two grieving women thought she was.  While drawing the reader into the compelling plot Wolverton simultaneously explores that common human tendency to feel we actually \\"know\\" another person when in fact we are often only familiar with a select part of the whole...or we are merely interpreting their behavior...or simply projecting our own experience onto them. This extremnely well written novel accomplishes this all in a quiet and subtle manner which haunted this reader long after finishing the book.  It's a real gem not to be missed.	2005-05-28

Coming back to school after holiday break Cal discovers there has been a murder in his dorm room.  Investigating the shushed crime he unearths a conspiracy involving both the faculty and fellow students. The flood of ghastly scenes which follow test Cal's sanity as he battles demons both past and present.  What is real?  What is in his mind?  The novel is filled with creepy passages, surreal visions, a dark sexuality, and various religious symbolism (i.e. stigmata).  The problem I had with the book wasn't the characters or content.  It was simply the style.  The artistic slant given the narrative flow was muddled and made it extremely hard to follow at points.  The distance needed to decipher the plot made immersion in THE NIGHT CLASS tough -- which for horror is necessary for me.  Try as I might I just couldn't lose myself in Piccirilli's dark vision...and I was so ready to be taken to that gruesome place.	2005-05-23

Kate Bornstein's very existence is a defiance of gender labels so it's no wonder it should be the topic of her first book. <br /> <br />     Bornstein, a transsexual S&M feminist, performance artist, playwright, NEA casualty, spokesperson, and talk show regular became a celebrated theorist as well with the publication of GENDER OUTLAW.  This fascinating and informative account of her own experiences is also an accessible exploration of gender politics and the current bipolar gender breakdown as an oppressive class system.  Drawing on numerous sources and told with frankness and humor, the book covers a great deal of territory such as the mental preparation for and the logistics of genital reconstructive surgery, her reentry into the world, her argument for gender as a social construct, the script of her art/theory play `Hidden: A Gender', and roles the transgendered have played in other cultures. <br /> <br />     With her plays, her book, her talk show appearances and her lectures Kate Bornstein is working to break the myths and mystery of the transgendered.  Her work is a true union of life and art with education and understanding as the end goal.  This is a fascinating exploration of a topic mostly taken for granted in our culture.  Discovering that gender is more than simply genitalia is a true revelation.   <br />	2005-05-22

It was an ideal creepy late night companion.  His writing style is enjoyable -- very vivid and the breadth of his imagination is especially impressive. The book is filled with rich horrific visions. I also enjoyed that he injected some fresh thoughts and unique concepts into the horror genre -- a very admirable undertaking. In my opinion the greatest weakness of the book was character development. The 5 primary characters are rather underwritten and as a result they somewhat blend into one another.  That caused some confusion.  Differentiating them grew difficult at times -- and frequently it didn't seem to really matter anyway.    <br /> <br />The plot concerns how five different individuals are drawn to a house they lived in as children...and the strange evil girl who inhabits their collective past.  As the novel progresses we understand the reason for the house's existence and the reason all these indivudals have been drawn back within it's walls.  I was enjoyably immersed in it's frequently surprising plot which spans life, the afterlife, and the gray area in-between.     <br /> <br />It prompted me to go out and purchase another of his books (The Revelation) as soon as I finished.	2005-05-16

However, more than the killer this book is about the two detectives assigned to the case.  Jessica Balzano is a rookie homicide cop and single divorced mother who must battle several of her own demons to solve the case.  She is partnered with (externally) tough veteran Kevin Byrne who has his own ghosts to battle and has more depth and senstivity than at first meets the eye.  With this novel Montanari has created a solid book with a gripping plot and frenetic pacing that captured my attention from the gruesome start.  The Rosary Girls shines with fine writing, wonderful characterization, and crackling dialogue...it all builds to a very satisfying climax that will leave you gasping.  The only problem I had with the book were some muddled scenes which peppered the text, mostly involving the several red herrings in the plot.  This is one of those books that will someday make an EXCELLENT film, but you can be one of the ones to say, \\"I read that book when it was first published.\\"	2005-04-25

The core of opera's queerness is dismantled and reassembled with a reflective and lyrical precision that defies typical essay format and approach.  This is a brilliant monologue -- a very entertaining brainstorm which even includes silly graphics. It's smart, funny, personal, and spirited and even of interest for the operatically challenged. In fact, I bet big opera fans would give this a five.	2005-02-22

Set in 1962 Venice the book focuses on a young gay writer (Mark Trigger) sent to ghost write the autobiography of fiery opera diva Adriana Grafanas (a character closely modeled upon Maria Callas).  Over the course of a year the book traces Mark's awakening sexual identity as well as his tumultuous relationship with Adriana.  Over time he discovers the woman behind the legend, a woman obsessed with acceptance while facing the erosion of her talent, a woman whose life has become her greatest performance and whose truth is ultimately an operatic tragedy of mythical proportions. <br />     As an ardent fan Mark is promptly swept up in Adriana's life and dramas, a world populated by a cast of profoundly fabulous and colorful characters - a sexy leading man, a jet setting princess, a gay Italian film director, gossips, critics, \\"omosensualis\\" galore, and many more.  Even Venice itself is brought vividly to life, given characterization through precise description and a brilliant use of language that made me want to drop everything and learn Italian. <br />     In addition to being a sexy lot of fun the book also explores the tangled skein of issues involving the artist -- the state of celebrity, self-invention and transformation, gay identity, determination verses destiny, redemption and acceptance, the elements of genius, the enduring nature of art by all too human creators, and much more.  Operatic to say the least!  This is a fascinating stew to consider with no easy answers, which seems to be the ultimate truth of great art and the ultimate deception of all who attempt to define it.   <br />	2005-02-06

Her newest collection of essays, VAMPS AND TRAMPS, includes sharpened swords drawn and abruptly driven into the current direction of gay activism, feminist thought, and academia. Her criticism is fierce, at once educated and adolescent, she is a rebel thinker whose mind seems in constant overdrive. She's philsophy with cajones.  In addition this book contains her thoughts on all aspects of sex and sexuality, AIDS, prostitution, abortion, rape, and homosexuality. VAMPS AND TRAMPS also contains a blistering essay on Susan Sontag, an examination of Lady Di's popularity, Foucault body-of-work slams, and much more.  Never boring, this book of breathless vitality is volcanic.

Whether he's discussing true love in Coordinate Geometry class, true lust for David Cassidy, the enduring pains of sissy torture, the unrefined glories of 70s pop culture, or the idiosyncrasies of his family, Frank DeCaro has created a frothy memoir readers aren't likely to forget.

The incredible life of the controversial photographer is given new focus in the biography Mapplethorpe: Assault with a Deadly Camera by friend, confidant, and former lover Jack Fritscher. Insider knowledge of the man humanizes a complex individual who has become obscured by his art and by the scourge of censorship.  <br />     This revealing portrait by Hastings House publishers shows Mapplethorpe from his early days as a fledgling photographer. As the former editor of Drummer magazine, it was Fritscher who gave Mapplethorpe his first magazine cover. The biography traces his rise to prominence as the avant-garde photographer of the New York art scene, his sexual obsessions, his ongoing relationship with punk legend Patti Smith, his drug use, his submersion into leather culture, his love of beauty, his theories on art, and much more. Into the narrative Fritscher weaves a fair amount of artistic exploration and examination as well.  <br />     Mapplethorpe: Assault with a Deadly Camera also contains a generous number of photos and a gold mine of data about not only Robert Mapplethorpe, but about the larger scope of the gay leathersex New York scene of the late 70s and early 80s. Fritscher explores somewhat extensively the great creators of the erotic image from that period such as Rex, as well as those on the photographic cutting edge such as Joel-Peter Witkin. By exploring Mapplethorpe's influences as well as his life, Fritscher provides the reader with a wider understanding not only of the artist, but also of his world and times. <br />	2005-01-05

The premise of his latest book is looking at intention not as a mere exercise of the will, but as a separate force.  Dyer maintains that intent is something that can be tapped into, explored, and used to further one's personal goals and life situation. It is a matter of making this \\"connnection\\" with the very essence of intent and following some basic natural rules for its implementation.  Beyond that this force is effortless, it flows.   <br />     Dyer has such a knack for inspiring the reader that this book is like a motivational seminar/therapy session/and life overhaul workshop all rolled into one.  THE POWER OF INTENTION is another Dyer title to read, digest, and reread in order to keep the ideas fresh and one's mindset on course.

At its surface the novel is the story of Edward Manners - a 40ish, drinky, and rather raunchy former academic who relocates to a small Belgian town to work as a tutor.  Almost at once Edward becomes infatuated with Luc, a student.  His obsession is comic, tragic, and romantic.  With this as its core THE FOLDING STAR then begins to reveal a much deeper and more complex reality.  The interconnectedness of various lives and histories soon begins to become apparent, with former details gaining greater significance and literary relief in this engrossing epic of obsession and taboo.

Primarily this book deals with discovering and tapping into your true self - that knowing part of you which is eternal, has perspective, is serene, and sees only situations - not problems or conflict.  However, the ego (our consciousness of ourselves as separate from this underlying essence) is a barrier -- and is in direct conflict to experiencing this sacredness we all share.  What Dyer offers is a plan to remove our ego and all the strivings, judgements, internal voices, addictions, and negativity in order to discover the spiritual essence inside us all. Interesting Dyer maintains that by overcoming the drive, needs, and divisiveness of the ego that every hunger we have is sated or becomes no longer important.  Meditation and the ensuing awareness is the key to discovery.  This is a perfect continuation of Dyer's themes and fans of the man will not be disappointed.	2004-11-25

However, through every bit of it Dusty maintained a wacky and wonderful sense of humor.

Grimsley not only paints with a dazzling richness and depth of character, he also explores the nature of memory and the need for acceptance even as it comes in direct conflict with the survival instinct.

IN AWE is certainly one of the most original, poetic, amd menacing gay novels outside of Dennis Cooper's work in recent memory.  It's a moody and atmospheric horror movie with deep literary significance (Imagine a Gen-X Faulkner on acid writing a horror novel - and toss in equal parts Shirley Jackson, Dennis Cooper, and David Lynch).  This meticulously crafted novel follows a season in the STRANGE lives of 3 Lawrence Kansas misfits.  The completely absorbing and slightly surreal plot defies succinct description but includes mutilated mannequins, a vile of urine, and numerous other surprises.  Suffice it to saw IN AWE is one hell of a ride.  Demented, evocative, descriptive, deeply profound, and not recommended for the squeamish...big ole GORE ALERT...and I'm not talking former VP Al or his wife Tipper.  The characters were a bit tough for me to get a handle on...but the strongest presence in this novel is that overall menacing mood and that holds it all together.	2004-11-19

Reality is consistently filtered through veils of memory, family and personal history, sexual secrecy, legend, lore and more.  The result is a reality that is fleeting and no more tangible than moonlight.

Film director James Whale ('Frankenstein' and 'Bride of Frankenstein') suffers from mental erosion as a complication from his recent stroke.  His life is now ruled by his past and the random surfacing of memories - childhood, poverty, horrific experiences in the trenches during WWI, his days as a celebrated film director, his life as a gay man in Hollywood, etc.  It's all uncontrolled and very painful.  Whale finds the fact that he will eventually lose his mind even more unbearable.  Enter Clay Boone - a straight, hunky, \\"monster-sized\\" gardener hungry for life experience and drawn to the aged celebrity.  Seeing Clay gives Whale an idea - he'll somehow have the monster/man kill him, therefore giving his life a sort of fitting conclusion.  He will be the director of his death as well.  FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN traces the developing relationship between Whale and Clay over the course of several weeks with surprising twists and equally moving turns as events progress towards a rewarding conclusion.  A brilliantly imagined novel, a rich historical atmosphere, and a riveting character study.  A wonderful read.  Frightening, funny, sexy, and very unique.	2004-11-17

It's about his girlfriend and his boyfriend and about dealing with parents while trying to assert independence.  It's about the sheer vastness of the future and the countless possibilities it presents.  It's about being 17 and therefore includes much angst and drug use and racing hormones.  This is a story of self-discovery and self-acceptance.  It's personal and at the same time universal in the questions it raises about life and decisions.  D.

This sweet, eccentric, moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town.  Three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared, closeness is established, and love blooms....think FLANNERY O'CONNOR meets SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with a dash of STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  Themes of finding one's place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative.  It has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth.  Primary assets are the \\"thick as molasses\\" southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters.	2004-11-17

This is an absorbing (and sad!) study of the emergence, glory, descent, and eventual debasement of an icon...as well as an interesting commentary on the addictive nature of fame.  THE CROSSING is also noteworthy as a chronicle of the birth of modern swimming and a satisfying glimpse into mid-Victorian culture and social mores.

Merlis breaks very fresh literary ground with this imaginative tale of contemporary hustler/stripper/heir Pyrrhus being led by an oracle (and a eunuch) to claim his birthright as the son of Achilles and conquerer of The Trojans in the Trojan War.  AN ARROW'S FLIGHT is a brilliant (and tres gay) retelling of THE ODYSSEY as well as an on-target commentary on current gay identity and politics.  The narrative presents a crazy and brilliant mix of then and now, classic and disposable, enduring and fleeting, myth and mansex, humor and tragedy, and much more...and amazingly it all makes sense!  With this novel Merlis surpasses even the highest hopes I had after his wonderful debut novel AMERICAN STUDIES.  I think this one is destined to be a classic gay novel in the years to come.

REAL MAGIC is another work by Dr. Dyer that literally had me absorbed and excited and reading along with highlighter in hand (Which is my highest accolade I suppose).  This book contains all sorts of strategies for bringing magic, coincidence, and miracles into everyday life...so that these things become everyday occurances.  REAL MAGIC is a real source of bound inspiration - the kind of book I read and think \\"Oh yeah, this is what I need to do to get my life back on course.\\"  It reminds me of who I truly am.  It's very applicable and very readable and is about miracles yet very much grounded in the real world...which is something I look for in books of this nature.  Dyer covers every aspect of life from finances and health to addictions to relationships and of course the basic \\"goals\\" of happiness and fulfillment/discovery of life purpose.  Dyer is an expert not so much at giving ideas but awakening ideas...and yet it seems fresh and not simply a rehash of thousands of other books out there.  That combo is priceless and it sure works for me.	2004-11-16

In 'You'll See It When You Believe It' he gives a detailed account of how to change not only the way you perceive reality, but reality itself. He shows how to bring your reality to a higher and more enlightened level which will necessarily include manifesting good, being internally driven, heightening the power of coincidence and connection, getting in the flow of the universe, achieving a greater sense of serenity, being in the moment, and being free of negative and fruitless emotions.  It's the sort of book that makes you want to highlight passages and ideas.  The text is filled with personal stories, examples and anecdotes to teach and inspire.  It's ideal for those needing a little nudge (or a big jolt) in life.  And it's ideal fuel for change.	2004-11-05

Each masterfully written segment is amazing in its own way - multi-layered, absorbing, rich with an air of menace (unsettling), and a recurring habit of smashing all notions of predictability. The surprises blindsided me every time. My favorite novella was 'The Hundred and Ninety-Nine Steps' about a strange isolated woman on an archaeological dig. However, all three stories left a strong impression. It must have been nice for Mr. Faber to work on some shorter pieces after his mammoth novel 'The Crimson Petal and the White'.  <br />	2004-11-01

Arnott's juxtaposition of the two elements (the mob & homosexuality) provide a truly uncommon combination and tension that's utterly fascinating.  The atmospheric work is amazing as well.  The underground scene vividly comes to life, is driven by a solid plot, peopled with excellent characters (especially Harry himself), and given great period touches...and it even includes a guest appearance by Judy Garland.  The Long Firm is a bold and successful literary undertaking that really delivers on it's promise...and makes the reader an offer he/she can't refuse.  Seedy, sensational, and a truly unique gay historical/cultural treat.	2004-10-30

It was a wild time when everyone seemed larger than life --- a time when egos, libidos, and liquor ran free and very wild!  No where was this hypnotic chaos more pronounced than in the artistic community.  By tracing and weaving her narrative around and about the lives and social circles of 4 amazing women (Zelda Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, Edna Ferber, and Edna St. Vincent Millay) Meade captures the artistic pulse of the era wonderfully.  This is a very entertaining book of authors and the literary set behaving SO badly that it's surprising they still had the energy (much less the time) to write.  You know you are in for some twisted fun when Dorothy Parker seems the sanest person in the crowd!!  Extremely enjoyable!    <br />	2004-10-28

If you're looking to make some changes in your life Dr. Wayne Dyer outlines the nine principles for (not so much getting what you want) as living a more fully rewarding life.  It's more about getting into the flow of living rather than making any sort of material demands and having them promptly met.  'Manifest Your Destiny' is filled with numerous ideas and insights to expand your take on reality, enhance your everyday existence, feel a deeper connection to the world, and really change in a deeper and more substantial way than 99.9 percent of the self-help books on the shelf.  I found Dyer's explanations logical and easy to follow and felt an almost internal 'click' that what I was reading was right for me.  Few books strike me that way and this is one which I have periodically read to recenter myself when life starts to feel a bit too confusing and chaotic.  Reading this book is a wonderful way to regain focus and clarity.	2004-10-28

It's told in alternating (then and now) chapters and follows a handful of graudates through Vietnam(an extremely harrowing segment), cancer, adultery, and other life changing experiences.  O'Brien explores the choices his characters have made and the reverberative consequences of those decisions.  At it's core 'July July' explores the loss of youthful innocence and the accompanying idealism and shows what these characters  have adopted to replace that absence or void in their lives.  O'Brien also shows how -- given the right reminder (like a reunion) this hope and love of being alive can sometimes be reborn.  I found this novel a gripping and very moving reading experience.	2004-10-28

Tatum O'Neal was an Oscar winner & star at a very young age (Paper Moon, The Bad News Bears, Nickelodeon, International Velvet, etc.) and seemed to have it all --- but appearances can be very deceiving. The tales of her early home life are horrific with abuse (physical,verbal, and mental!)by her father Ryan O'Neal making it seem like tales from the front.  Not since Mommie Dearest has a film star come across as a worse parent!!  Paper Life is a tell all that truly lives up to the title...Tatum O'Neal pulls no punches in divulging everything and even manages to own up and take responsibility for her own drug and alcohol abuse.  This book features a truly all star cast --- her troubled marriage to tennis star John McEnroe, a ditzy and self-absorbed Farrah, a drunken Richard Burton (her lecherous and twisted costar in Circle of Two), Cher, Madonna and Sean Penn, Mackenizie Phillips, Bianca Jagger, Michael Jackson, Kristy McNichol, Burt Reynolds, expert joint roller Anjelica Huston, Melanie Griffith, Walter Matthau, John Ritter, etc.  If you love Hollywood memoirs that are painfully frank and hold back nothing than Paper Life is the lurid and delicious treat for you!!!

The novel revolves around the theme of healing on several levels. Reeve is 62 and hospitalized after a severe beating by a hustler.  He feels his sex life, his dignity, and everything he held sacred - those very things which defined him - are all gone. Over the four day span of this novel, Reeve gradually regains his footing, adapts, and rebuilds his life.  Most importantly he recognizes that he is a survivor.  Much of this realization occurs in his detailed reminiscing about Tom, an early mentor of his who killed himself when his exposure as a homosexual as well as his betrayal by a lover combined to undermine his world.  Reeve also gets a renewed zest for life by the hunk in the adjoining hospital bed. American Studies is a book of incredibly strong characterization abundant in insights and displaying a skilled interweaving of stories.  It also contains interesting gay history, a strong narrative, and even some great laughs along the way.  Merlis has created a real gem!	2004-10-21

He decides to \\"create\\" his own zombie by kidnapping adolescent boys and performing frontal lobotomies on them --- scrambling their brains until they can see only Quentin.  Unfortunately Quentin has never performed a lobotomy before and is doing them primarily in his bathtub!

This is the thoroughly gripping, utterly creepy, and ultimately tragic story of Dare Wright, her mother Edie, her doll Edie (Yes, the doll was named after her mother!) and Dare's creation of The Lonely Doll series of children's books popular in the 1950s-60s.  Edie was also an accomplished portrait artist!  Eccentric doesn't even BEGIN to describe this family dynamic.  This mother/daughter duo often slept in the same bed, took numerous photos (many nude!) of each other, played an ongoing game of dress up and make-believe, and existed almost exclusively in a clinging calustrophobic fantasy world built for two.  The parallels between Dare's life and her Lonely Doll books are chilling as is Edie's maniacal possessiveness of her daughter.  It's very reminiscent of the 70s film documentary 'Grey Gardens'...only with a doll named after the mother but fashioned to physically resemble the daughter. A gripping chronicle of two enmeshed and unbelievable lives that left me in awe many times...Wonderfully weird...dolly dearest indeed!	2004-09-25

Stahl brings the era and the man to life in this creative, evocative, and (YES!) sometimes funny book.  I FATTY is also a commentary on the fleeting and fickle nature of fame and public opinion. All Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle wanted was to be loved which makes the vicious turning of his once adorning public all the more tragic.

Ozick has written a smart, thoroughly compelling and wonderfully charactered neo-Victorian (people and themes and social symbolism blend) novel of displaced persons set in 1930s New York.  It's part social commentary, part the melodrama, part mystery.  It's simply amazing how Ozick takes a cubist approach to the philosophy being discussed...some live it, some study it, some defy it ---- but all are some form of it!  Thematically it's a novel of history and identity and the hazards and benefits of attachment as well as rejection.

There are frequent passages which are so on target and gorgeously done that they gave me chills.  I did a lot of rereading in parts.  This is a novel that eludes simply categorization such as 'Coming Out' or 'Issue' novel.  Give it a try.  This seems the start of a very promising career for Chee.  Can't wait to see what he does next!!!	2004-09-01

Funny Boy is an exquisite debut novel of unnatural and amazing grace, clarity, and subtlety.  Arjie's familiar and awkward coming of age and coming out as well as making sense of the world is set against the senseless backdrop of hate and prejudice in the Sri Lankan civil war between the Tamil and Sinhalese factions.  Rich with engrossing situations...I found myself learning about a new place and political background while drawn into the lives of these characters.  In that respect it reminded me of the more recent novel The Kite Runner.  Evocative, unique, and ultimately very rewarding.	2004-09-01

The Beauty of Men is the painful story of Lark, a survivor of an AIDS decimated group of friends in New York.  Middle aged and still in shock from his enormous loss, Lark has moved to northern Florida to care for his paralyzed mother.  The emptiness of Lark's life there prompts a deep exploration of his past and his current state as an aging gay man.  Depressed and in a state of \\"identity limbo\\" Lark finds brief solace at the local boat ramp tearoom and in his fantasies of a relationship with one-night-stand Becker.  Given this brief synopsis it should come as no surprise that The Beauty of Men is not a lighthearted read, but it is a compelling and rewarding one.  Lark's profound sense of loss and remorse is tempered by both undeniable truth and periodic humor.	2004-08-31

Rob Stevens' The Overfed Head takes a unique and potentially life changing approach to the issues of diet and weight loss.  Stevens' straightforward style, personal testimony, and solidly supported facts make his concepts readily accessible.  I was especially impressed with how Stevens' methodically debunks the &quot;industry&quot; of dieting as well as his common sense platform to return to our inborn &quot;Thintuition&quot; to tell us when we are hungry, what we're hungry for, and when we've had enough to eat.  In addition Stevens' explores the numerous other reasons people eat and how societal conditioning has made our brains the seat of most of our food issues rather than our stomachs!  I highly recommend The Overfed Head as a clear, concise, fresh and worthwhile way to change the way you view food and dieting in general.	2004-07-05
