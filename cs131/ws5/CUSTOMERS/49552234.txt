She provides a good history of the fiddling tradition in Alabama, reaching back to the 1800s.  I liked her descriptions of dances and contests, and her biographies of Alabama brag fiddlers are fascinating reading.  She also includes information on the traditions and beliefs associated with fiddling, and there are good appendixes that reveal the names of tunes and fiddlers from the early 20th Century.  This book will be interesting for those studying Alabama's history and folklife, and it is also an important contribution to the growing volume of scholarship on American fiddling as a whole.  The book also includes terrific photographs, some of which are over 160 years old.	2002-07-17

The book is valuable not only for learning an array of fantastic old-time tunes from top players, but it is also a fine record of the playing of top fiddlers.  Krassen includes good biographical information about the fiddlers, and he includes excellent photographs of the musicians.  It's a great book.  The tunes are not for novices, though, and they will challenge intermediate and even some advanced players.	2002-05-21

Rosenberg is an engaging writer and a fine historian.  He also performed with Bill Monroe and has continued to maintain a strong presence in bluegrass music.  The work rightly focuses on Monroe's early contributions to bluegrass music, and Rosenberg demonstrates how the musical structure and context is linked to major social issues and cultural expressions in American life.  The connections that Rosenberg makes between bluegrass and baseball are fascinating and right on the money.	2002-03-15

There is a wide range of interesting stories, and they cover various eras of Florida life. The stories are presented in an accessible style that is very close to the verbatim texts of actual storytellers who were recorded by fieldworkers in the state. The book is illustrated with fine drawings that have the whimsy of a cartoon but are not cutesy. The book contains creative ideas for teachers to use the stories in a range of classes, but the stories will also appeal to adult readers. This is a fine collection of actual stories told in Florida, and the book will be interesting to readers across the country.	2002-02-28

The book provides excellent resources for demonstrating how material folk cultural expressions can be studied for clues to regional identity.  Glassie then demonstrates that understanding how folk culture is distributed over geographic regions provides clues for studying American history.  It is an early study that links folklore to cultural geography and social history, and it provides a great starting point for understanding the scholarship in these areas within subsequent years.	2002-01-04

Milnes provides good descriptions of the history and the cultural contexts for fiddling in West Virginia.  He provides especially good descriptions of dances.  My favorite part of the book dealt with some of the traditional beliefs and practices associated with fiddling.  There are fascinating traditions that fiddlers continue to use, and there is a wealth of folklore associated with the instrument.  Milnes also provides a fine history of dulcimer music in Appalachia, and his work provides a corrective perspective about this instrument as he challenges the degree of purism and perhaps &quot;snootiness&quot; that is associated with fiddling.	2001-12-17

Most of the stories are legends, and there are also good examples of other genres such as myth.  The introduction covers some of the basic sources where these stories have been recorded and studied, and it provides an overview of the stories in the compilation.  The transcriptions are clear and well-organized, and I enjoyed reading the narratives.  There is also a list of motifs found in the stories, and this resource should prove to be useful for comparative studies of Florida folklore with the folk culture of other states, regions, and nations.	2001-10-22

Prior to Vlach's study, there had been well-documented and interesting studies of folklore within African-American communities.  But Vlach's work is the first thorough study of material folk culture that any folklore researcher had completed on African-American folk culture.  It's an in-depth and interesting study, and Vlach paved the way for additional research, some of which offers perspectives and interpretations that critique Vlach's findings. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in black history and culture, and it is filled with excellent documentation and intriguing insights that set the stage a range of important issues that are worth further examination.	2001-10-22

After introductory material that places his scholarship within the history of research on old-time fiddling, Titon focuses on the transcriptions of 170 tunes that are either unique to Kentucky or else characteristic of Kentucky fiddling styles. The tunes are transcribed in clear, accessible, and accurate musical notation. He includes transcriptions of older recordings made decades ago as well as transcriptions of recent field recordings. The tunes are from the repertoires of numerous players, and the transcriptions should thus be very useful in comparing individual techniques. They also will add to the store of tunes that fiddlers can play. Titon includes discographic and historical information on each tune, thereby adding to the usefulness of his study of Kentucky fiddling. I also appreciated the biographical information and photographs of the various fiddlers, and listening to the accompanying CD warmed the written notes on the cold, printed page. The book has a terrific bibliography for those interested in additional research on fiddling, and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in folk music, folklorists' scholarship, and Kentucky history. My only critique of the book is that Titon could have included more information about the style of fiddling used in each tune. Simply discussing bowing techniques, tempo, and ornamentation for various tunes within the pages where they were transcribed would have helped round out the excellent treatment of Kentucky fiddling.	2001-10-18

One could argue that this book confirms what's in the assassination literature, but the better argument is that Morrow is just making up a story based on what he's read.  I support this position by suggesting that his only claim to be involved in the assassination was the &quot;job&quot; he was given to purchase rifles and rig up a radio transmitter and receiver system.  If the CIA employed him only as a shopper and electronics whiz-kid on this mission, then why would they tell him the whole nefarious story and introduce him to gangsters?  The other major problem is that much of what he writes can't be backed up by facts.  For example, he writes of a James Bond-style quadruple murder in a south Florida motel.  But there is no record of these murders in the press nor in police reports.  Maybe the &quot;powers-that-be&quot; could hide one murder - but four murders out in public?  Yeah, right.	2001-08-20

Classic articles on ways to examine architecture in relation to cultural geography are featured prominently in this volume.  There are also important pieces of work that link architecture to the history of various ethnic groups, and I especially enjoyed articles that deal with contemporary forms of vernacular expression.  This is an important book for anyone interested in the study of folklore, history, art history, and architecture.  It could also be useful for practicing architects to read the essays for ideas to inspire their own designs.	2001-08-15

He primarily used resource materials from the 1930s Historic American Building Survey and WPA interviews with former slaves to develop a social history.  The research is solid and comprehensive.  Vlach demonstrates ways to interpret the buildings for information about the life of the people who worked and dwelled in them, and he backs up his conclusions with interview materials.  It's a terrific way of studying architecture that merges folklife studies with architectural history.  The conclusions expanded my understanding about history, and this book is an essential contribution to learning about black history.	2001-08-10

The book provides various ways of studying the games, songs, rhymes, and other forms of folk culture that children express.  It is an excellent resource for learning to understand ways that children's culture leads insight into the worldview of children.  I also am impressed with the ways that the study of children's culture leads one to think about common and implicit aspects of adults' culture that form important ways of thinking about life -- but need to be critically examined.  This volume should interest anyone who is curious about kids, but it is also academically-oriented and scholarly.	2001-08-07

The work is solid scholarship, and he provides empirical ways of researching and interpreting various forms of verbal expression.  The collection may be most useful as models for additional studies, and there is a great variety of research topics evoked what Bauman discusses.  At times, however, the conclusions are less-than earth-shattering, and the theoretical apparatus tends to get in the way of developing important conclusions and offering insight into why these conclusions are significant.

They are mostly from the mid to later part of the 19th century from the coastal lowlands area of Georgia.  The hundred + year-old tales are transcribed in a dialect, but they shouldn't be considered authentic renditions of the Gullah creolized language.  The book has a great introduction that explains how Jones came to compile the work and write other books on a range of subjects.  The dialect of the stories take a while to understand, but the glossary at the end of the book helps explain unfamiliar words.  The stories are really good ones, and it is great to see this important book in print.	2001-07-05

The problem is that this book is used as a defense of irrationality and as a cornerstone for critiques of reasoned argumentation and postmodernist discourse that challenges the validity of scientific thinking and rational argument.  The modes of discourse associated with this author-function open the door for a dangerous and romanticized view of the reality of mental illness.  For this, I must critique the author-function Foucault -- AND Foucault, himself does assert the independent author is merely a &quot;function&quot; or mode of discourse.  This book is dangerous when fed to impressionable minds struggling with the necessity to learn to think accurately and clearly.  Foucault wanted to subvert and transgress the bounds of the established social order -- I don't think he realized how dangerous some of these trangressions can be.  If, however, he did realize it, then Foucault was not merely a playful &quot;author-function&quot; but a truly evil human being:  an assertion that seems plausible when one reads about his personal life.	2001-05-15

He also has terrific backstage shots, photos of parking lot pickings, and nostalgic images, such as Uncle Pen's fiddle.  These photos portray fascinating facets of bluegrass music's history. Neil Rosenberg's writing complements and enhances these images. His writing provides sufficient information to answer significant questions raised in looking at Fleischhauer's photographs. As a special treat, the book includes a fine photo memorial and essay to Bill Monroe. This book is an excellent record of the early history of bluegrass, and it vividly portrays images that ring true today.	2001-05-09

Beginning with stories about night riders and beliefs about the supernatural, Fry documents stories about white people's use of folklore to attempt to intimidate African Americans.  The book traces out stories of night riders and legends throughout American history as it  demonstrates how the stories began with the patrollers and the KKK.  She demonstrates how the stories continued into the 20th century and how the old beliefs transformed into plausible scenarios that make sense in relation to contemporary social tensions.  The book has been critiqued for not dealing with black people's resistance to oppression, but this criticism misses the mark of what Fry accomplishes:  namely, she has written a careful analysis of relationships between belief, oral history, and systems that establish hegemonies.  To further balance out the aspects of resistance that show up in these complex belief systems, I would recommend reading Patricia Turner's excellent study &quot;I Heard it Through the Grapevine.&quot;	2001-04-25

At the time it was published, it received luke-warm reviews.  I'm not sure why reviewers did not originally appreciate this very fine study.   The topic is fascinating.  There are engaging discussions of the method Dorson used in studying the lives of millworkers.  But the content of the stories that Dorson documents must be recognized as an incredibly important contribution to the historical record.  Every chapter is highly readable, and the stories are fascinating, poignant, and moving.  There are rich and vibrant descriptions of the vitality of life within steel mills, and the work is an important contribution to preserving a record of an industry that has undergone rapid change.  Although some of the major theoretical issues that Dorson addressed are now dated, a reminder that this book was written almost 20 years ago reveals that the book has grown old gracefully.  This book is great  reading for anyone interested the occupational culture of steel mills and life in a milltown.  It is now essential reading for anyone interested in the history of the region.	2001-03-13

This book comes out of the WPA materials that were collected for the state of Virginia.  The book consists of photographs and excerpts from interviews along with introductory comments by the editors.  There are various themes that are presented, and the editors develop commentary to interpret what they present.  The photography is first rate, and there are a lot of interesting stories in this book that are well worth reading.

There are treatments of Robin Hood in relation to literary criticism, history, media, and a range of topics.  I found the section on history to be the most interesting.  Some of the essays provide model studies for investigating intriguing issues that relate to the development of ballads and stories about Robin Hood, and there is a great deal of scholarship for investigating historical kernels associated with the stories.  The section on media includes a few strong essays -- I enjoyed the treatment of Robin Hood on screen from the earliest movies into contemporary cartoons and even satires.  But some of the essays and in fact entire sections are really weak.  I thought that by far the least interesting (and the poorest written) essays were in the area that focused on literary criticism.

The book has a very fine introduction to the study of folklore as it relates to the collection and interpretation of jokes.  Each section is about jokes on specific topics, and each section includes introductory commentary that analyzes key themes in the jokes.  Be forewarned that these jokes are documented from near verbatim sources, so they might not be appropriate for children.  The book also includes examples of jokes that are racist and sexist, but the goal is not so much to sensationalize the objectionable material but rather to honestly show how these types of stories are part of folklore.	2001-03-08

What Bronner does, however, is to expand upon this idea and show that the Northeast also is home to a fascinating fiddle tradition.  He provides life histories and descriptions of styles of playing in New York.  Much of what Bronner writes about shows that the old-time music is also a characteristic cultural tradition of regions across America.

The book is valuable for folklorists, historians, anthropologists as well as biologists and anyone interested in relationships between environmental concerns and culture.  I would recommend this book highly and encourage readers to also look at important studies of maritime folklife such as the book &quot;Beautiful Swimmers,&quot; which deals with crabbing in the Cheasapeake Bay and &quot;Gladesmen,&quot; which deals with fishing and hunting in the Florida Everglades.	2001-03-02

This book might be useful in a graduate course in folklore studies, but by the time that students begin studying folklore at advanced levels, they will probably be interested in more complex and thorough studies of folklore.  The book might, however, be a good starting point for professors and students in other disciplines who are interested in folklore research.

Helias grew up in the community that he returned to study.  Consequently, he knows about the daily life of his community, and his training in European folklife studies provides him with an amazing resource for writing about the quotidian realities of Breton folk culture.  The book provides solid ethnographic description of daily life in the peasant village, and he writes of the ordinary and extraordinary experiences of daily life with equal grace and ease.  The book reads beautifully, and the insights are timely and even more poignant 20 years after he completed his insightful study.  This book is an inspiration to writers who present studies of folklife throughout the world, and it is essential reading for anyone interested in ethnographic writing.	2001-02-20

There are great ideas about using the everyday culture of various communities for intervention work in a variety of employment settings.  Teachers will find useful ideas and a well-written bibliography on the use of folklore in the classroom.  Park and recreation workers will find a good resource for developing projects and programs that use locally-based cultural resources for their programming.  The book contains ample ideas that can be used by those in medical fields, prisons, libraries, refugee services, and other organizations that work to deliver services to the public.  The book also contains a good introduction to the history and practice of studying folklore, and the excellent bibliographic references will provide readers with a variety of resources for further developing the approaches offered in this volume.	2001-02-19

In the first part of this book, he provides vivid and interesting examples that reveal ways in which tacit assumptions and implicit patterns of culture can influence interviewers to make mistakes in their research techniques.  What is particularly inspiring about this book, is that Briggs refuses to throw up his hands in despair about the validity of field research.  He shows how understanding cultural dynamics associated with interviewing can provide useful ways to develop stronger interviews.  In sum, the cultural diversity that he documents provides a stepping stone for learning about others rather than an obstacle that prevents one from researching other individuals, groups, and communities.  This book is a good antidote to the practice of ethnographic navel gazing, and it should be useful to folklorists, anthropologists, sociologists, reporters, and anyone else who learns and practices interview techniques.	2001-02-19

I especially enjoyed the case studies in which the pragmatic implications of thinking about tradition in a range of conceptual domains was tested by fieldwork and ethnographic description.  Some of the writers take very different approaches toward defining &quot;tradition.&quot;  For example, one writer presents a convincing argument that &quot;invented traditions&quot; are ersatz constructions that make a mockery of the history and culture of various indigenous peoples whereas another writer presents an idea of &quot;invented tradition&quot; that seems to resonate well with one particular society's own thinking about its history and culture.  Although the discussion of a range of issues is thorough and intriguing, one weakness of the book is that the authors do not cite the scholarship of folklorists.  Folklorists have been engaged in the study of traditional culture for over a century, and their writings on key words such as &quot;tradition&quot; will be very useful for anyone else engaged in scholarship about the issues in Mauze's volume.  In particular, readers interested in thinking about tradition can consult Dan Ben-Amos's article &quot;The Six Strands of Tradition&quot; in the Journal of Folklore Research as well as Henry Glassie's essay &quot;Tradition&quot; in the Journal of American Folklore.	2001-02-19

The chapters on occupational folklife and tourism are especially strong.  The writers provide a very readable and informative study of the types of traditional activities associated with the many different ethnic and occupational groups in the region.  There is excellent background history on the Seminoles, Miccosukees, and Cuban communities as well as fine descriptions of the folk arts, musical traditions, and festivals associated with each of the various cultures.  The bibliography is excellent, and it is a useful starting point for further developing the insights of the writers.

Bendix provides one way to think about folklore in relation to political movements such as nationalism and capitalism.  A major problem of this book is that the term &quot;folklore&quot; and the enterprise of folklore studies is much older than she assumes.  Recent research has demonstrated that the term &quot;folklore&quot; is actually close to 1,000 years old -- not 150 years old.  This new discovery changes her origin myth for the beginnings of folklore research.  Although Bendix rightly critiques jingoistic nationalism, her own European heritage seems to provide a bias against any form of nationalism.  She advocates an ideology of &quot;globalism&quot; that she asserts is in opposition to nationalism.  But she needs to deal with the fact that globalism can be a handmaiden of international corporate culture to make an effective argument.  This oversight brings us to the major problem with the book.  Namely, Bendix needs to pay more attention to left-wing nationalist movements that have also had an incredible influence on folklife studies -- especially in America.  To begin to write the history of folklore studies, one would do well to begin with Bendix's study but then expand the dialouge (and debate) into liberal and radical nationalist movements.  One counter-narrative to Bendix's history could be found in the use of folklore amongst the Wobblies as well as in the use of folklore for identity politics among Black nationalist and American Indian groups who use folklore to make political claims for self-determination.  One final problem is that she decries Richard Dorson's coinage of the term &quot;fakelore,&quot; but if she had read Dorson more thoroughly, it would be clear that Dorson was actually using the term &quot;fakelore&quot; to critique the marriage between nationalism and capitalism that Bendix works to break apart.	2001-02-13

Cantwell started out his research by working on a history of the Festival of American Folklife.  When this project was curtailed due to foreseen circumstances, he reworked his research into a review and critique of the festival.  The book examines the festival in terms of ways in which participants, performers, producers, audience members, and others in the cast of characters act out their various roles on the mall in Washington DC.  Cantwell focuses his study on the idea that the festival provides a way to break stereotypes about other people.  He develops his argument to emphasize that stereotyping can involve a range of factors including arbitration of meanings as well as enagements with &quot;the other.&quot;  Throughout the book, he makes deep inquiries into the salience of stereotyping within American history and culture.  The book is best when Cantwell writes interpretive descriptions of what he observed at the festival and what he has researched in archives and libraries.  At times, however, the bulky theoretical apparatus and the over-blown jargon detracts from the rich, sensitive insights that the writer makes about American (folk)life.  Despite the opaqueness of many sections, this book is an amazing study of festivity in American life.	2001-02-12

Thoroughly documented, this book is a fine guide for finding out how various towns and cities in Indiana got their names.  What is especially interesting is Baker's introduction to this volume.  He shows how there are common patterns to the development of place names in the state.  Baker then provides ways for readers to draw conclusions about the history of the state by finding out how various names came to be.  This book is very useful for understanding the folklore of Indiana, and it is a model for studies of place names in other states.	2001-02-05

He discusses the history of log cabins in America, and he develops an intriguing way to study the buildings to learn about American history.  The book also has a thorough description of how a log building is constructed.  The writing is so detailed that one could probably build a log cabin just by reading a few chapters.  Roberts finds out some intriguing points about log buildings that challenge the conventional ideas about these structures.  First, he provided convincing evidence that hewn-log buildings were probably covered with siding.  When originally constructed, the first cabins were almost indistinguishable from frame houses.  Second, Roberts challenges the &quot;myth of the log cabin&quot; by proving that log cabins were built more by members of a community working together rather than by lone, rugged individuals who were out to conquer the wilderness with little more than an axe, knife, and gun.  It is an important study, and I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in architecture and American history.	2001-02-05

The editor, Alan Dundes, has compiled a broad range of studies that provide early approaches to theorizing myth-making and then moves into relatively recent approaches to myth.  The essays are well-chosen, and they are linked together by Dundes' well-written introductions.  Dundes is a fine folklorist, and his thorough grounding in the history of folklore study provides an excellent resource for placing the essays into a useful intellectual framework for learning about myth.  Some of the essays are classics, and Dundes provides fair as well as critical appraisals of the various approaches used by the essayists.  This compilation is essential for anyone interested in mythology as well as anyone interested in religious history and the social sciences.	2001-02-05

Revivalism refers to a number of movements within traditional music.  It can refer to ways in which older forms and genres are repopularized, a common dynamic in folk music.  Revivalism can also refer to ways in which those who grew up outside of a particular musical tradition become interested in a form of musical expression.  This dynamic happens a great deal as, for example, teenagers from Philadephia became interested in old-time music during the 1960s.  The book provides a great range of ways to think about revivalism, and it is an excellent historical study of folk music from the 1950s and 60s.  Many of the writers take very different approaches and offer different perspectives on the music, and the work should stimulate lively discussion and more study of this facet of musical history.  There is a lack of a unified way of pulling together the disparate threads of thought, but perhaps that is task that remains to be done by those at the cutting edge of folklore study.	2001-02-05

Paredes takes a &quot;literary ethnographic&quot; approach to studying the ballad singer Gregorio Cortez.  Paredes develops interesting and rich ways of applying literary analysis to the ballads.  He also uses the study of history along with ethnographic inquiry to challenge the image of the Texas ranger as a knight in shining armor.  For anyone interested in social history, ethnographic study, and literary approaches to studying culture, I would highly recommend seeing how this fine folklorist integrates all three approaches in a fascinating story.  What is especially interesting is that he was taking this approach three decades ago.	2001-01-31

Morrison Series in Southern Studies)	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Pioneering Work on the Politics of Culture	David Whisnant coined the term the &quot;politics of culture.&quot; He provides an application of a theory of &quot;systemic cultural intervention&quot; in this book.  Essentially, Whisnant argues that cultural intervention is a process in which specialists work to create change in a community.  He looks at ways that positive interventions can bring about positive as well as negative effects.  He also provides ways to examine how cultural intervention can be developed for negative purposes.  Whisnant is a folklorist, and he examines how wealthy northerners went to Appalachia to promopte folklife programming in settlement schools and festivals.  The book is very useful for examining how outside interventionists need to understand the culture and political dynamics in communities that they enter.  At times, however, there is a degree of cynicism in Whisnant's writing that seems to emerge from a nativist stance by Whisnant himself.  The lines he draws between &quot;outsider&quot; and &quot;insider&quot; are too neat and rigid, and the analysis would be improved by recognition that the case histories that he examines had far more complex issues at stake.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend reading this work to understand fascinating aspects of Appalachian history and to consider ways to work more effectively in contemporary communities.	2001-01-31

Montell demonstrates that oral history and the study of folklore can be used to ascertain answers to important questions that pertain to historical analysis and the study of culture.  He examines stories about murders and killings in southcentral Kentucky, analyzing them for common themes and implicit assumptions about violence and retribution.  He concludes that the high incident of violence in the area can be understood, in part, by looking at the stories to reveal attitudes about a &quot;subculture of violence&quot; within the region.  Although Montell cautions the reader against overgeneralizing from his work, his research suggests that the high incident of violence in this region of the South can be understood by identifying areas in which violence is considered an acceptable means for resolving certain types of disputes.  It is to Montell's credit that he demonstrates how to interpret the texts he collected in order to develop these types of conclusions.  Furthermore, his analysis of the stories suggests resources for interpreting violence in other communities.  The book is well-written and provides an excellent model for similar types of research projects.	2001-01-26

As I read it, I kept looking for main themes, big ideas, cohesive arguments, and clarity.  Boy, did I feel like I was reading the wrong book.  I thought that I was missing something, but when I went to class, none of the seven other advanced-level doctoral students had anything to say about this book either.  In discussion, I found that the reason why no one had anything to say about this book was related to our perceptions that the book displayed a relative absence of main themes, big ideas, cohesive arguments, and clarity.  All of the students thought that we were all a few watts short of firing up the light bulbs that day, so we found other things to talk about in class.  In the last fifteen minutes, the professor said, &quot;Well, we really do need to discuss the book.&quot; No one said anything, but we had a good time doodling in our notebooks.  She then asked, &quot;Could anyone say what this book is about?&quot; I stared blankly at the ship that I was drawing in my notebook.  No one else looked at her.  She then concluded the class by saying that she didn't know what this book was about either. I still don't quite know why she assigned it, but she said that the idea of mapping communications might be more useful than analyzing culture.	2001-01-25

Along with volumes on the folklore of South Florida, Louisiana, Kentucky, Carolina Piedmont, and the Ozarks, McGregory's book provides historical sketches and ethnographic descriptions of an area that is largely neglected in studies of American's regions.  The author succeeds in providing an interesting social history of the area that reaches from Florida's Panhandle into neighboring areas in Georgia and Alabama.  Her discussion of contemporary forms of traditional culture that share common historical links provides an interesting overview of ways in which activities such as rattlesnake round-ups, gospel-sings, storytelling, and yard art are related to wider patterns of history.  The book is primarily descriptive, and the texts of stories, songs, rhymes, and tall tales are interesting.  McGregory also provides good descriptions of Sacred Harp sings, local festivals, and other community-based forms of recreation.  Although written for a non-scholarly audience, the book includes analysis and interpretive commentary, and there are ample references for further study.  The book provides an interesting point of view in that African-American history and culture are brought into the foreground throughout the writing.  It would have been stronger if McGregory had brought a more specific focus to the work and beefed up her commentary in her afterword that provides a conclusion.	2001-01-24

What is especially interesting, is that the musician was virtually unknown, and I have never even heard any of this musician's works.  Yet, I came away from this book with a profound appreciation for Joe Scott and an even deeper appreciation for Edward Ives's writing abilities.  Ives uses fieldwork techniques from folklore studies and oral history research to develop a life-history of Joe Scott, a ballad-maker and ballad-singer who was previously known only for penning a tune known only within a small northeastern region.  Ives completes thorough research on Scott's life, pulling together information from obscure sources and from the commonplaces of local memory.  He develops an in-depth biography in which he places Scott's musical creativity within the context of an interesting life.  Ives not only demonstrates ways to glean fascinating insights from snippets of information but he also provides an incredibly interesting presentation of the results of his finding and conclusions.  His conclusions about artistry, poetry, and creativity are intriguingm, and they are backed by credible and well-reasoned arguments.  Ives is a first-rate writer, and the story that he tells about Joe Scott is reads like a first-rate novel.	2001-01-22

Erika Brady begins with a consideration of early recordings, focusing her analysis on relationships between perception and audio technology.  She then winds her way through implications of how this relationship is relevant to developing ethnographic descriptions of folklore and other forms of expressive culture.  The book will be useful to anyone interested in phenomenology, social history, intellectual history, and ethnographic description.  Much of her work provides a strong basis for more nuanced readings of ways in which new forms of technology affect--and are affected by-- ethnographically-grounded research.  Brady is an insightful writer and a fine stylist.  Her subtle wit enfolds sharp commentary that reveals hidden nuances of history, and her arguments are always cogent, clear, and intriguing.  The book is written from Brady's experience of working with hundreds of old recordings, and her practical experience of handling and listening to the recordings is clearly evident in her writing.  The book is illustrated with historical and contemporary photographs that are well-chosen and provide rich context for the study.	2000-10-23

Hinson takes his readers through an anniversary service for a gospel group while providing thorough and insightful descriptions of salient aspects of the context for the religious expression that he presents in this sensitive and articulate study.  Although Hinson allows for a range of interpretations about what the participants are experiencing in religious devotion, he makes a strong argument that is too easily dismissed in academic research.  Namely, rather than explaining away encounters with the supernatural as physical or psychological phenomena, the researcher will gain a different understanding of culture if he or she takes the claims of a believer as a valid starting point for ethnographic inquiry. Hinson suggests that experiencing divine presence provides a new way for readers to truly &quot;understand&quot; what he writes of in this book.  I have attended countless gospel services, and Hinson's book provides an excellent resource for gaining a greater awareness of what I have seen as believers &quot;have church.&quot;  Hinson's methods, theories, and insights as a folklorist provides an incredibly rich and accurate way to complete ethnographic study.

She attempts to make the claim that Barrie created a new genre of fantasy with the publication of Peter Pan. The problem is that Barrie's books about Peter Pan are actually components of a genre well-studied and documented for hundreds of years. Even a cursory read of scholarship in folklore would have clearly demonstrated to Rose that Peter Pan is a Marchen, a genre of folklore in which a poor, obscure hero is called to complete acts of bravery in a land of fantasy and magic. There are numerous other problems with her analysis. Even reading this study as an essay on contemporary social issues is a confusing exercise, at best, because Rose's style tends to obfuscate rather than to provide any semblance of clarity. Sorry to be so critical of literary criticism, but incoherence and bad writing simply do not belong in scholarly discourse.	2000-10-16

I was, however, interested in the writing of an ethnographic study of the folklife of potters, weavers, and other artisans.  By the time that I finished reading Glassie's rich description of the life and work of the people of Turkey, I found out why he was so amazed at the quality of artwork in this exciting land.  To begin to understand the work of the potter, the weaver, the calligrapher, and the woodworker in Turkey, Glassie takes the reader on a pilgrimmage into the Islamic nation.  The words, narrative, and rich photographs are the physical manifestations that bring the reader into a shared sense of presence with the artists.  By the time I finished reading this fine book, I came to feel as if I was actually experiencing the sense of peace and presence that inspires master artists in Turkey.  As I closed the book, I found that I not only was more intrigued by Turkey and Islam, I had gained a glimmer of a shared experience of working as an artist in this nation.  Glassie inspires the author by showing that printed words and reproduced photographs in a book can provide a sense of the  presence that is evoked when one admires woven rugs, woodwork, and ceramic plates.  Through ink he provides a glimmer of the light that shines out from the ceramic glaze covering the pot of a master artist -- or usta -- in a Turkish ceramic studio.	2000-10-03
