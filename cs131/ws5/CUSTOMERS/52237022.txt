Each story portents the author's unique view of different aspects of the human condition, from true love to brotherly love, and about those who have no conscience toward others.            Confirmed bachelor and successful civil attorney Barry Chandron gets a mid-life chance at romance when he is smitten by the much younger Tildy Jennings, who is also a practicing attorney.  They meet at a local Bar Association meeting, and their relationship ignites overnight.  While being euphoric about finally finding the love of his life, Barry takes on one of the most important cases of his career, the defense of a medical malpractice lawsuit against his neurosurgeon brother, Dan Chandron.  Dan is honest about his medical mistakes, and Barry assures his brother that he can successfully settle this horrific case.  There's just one big problem, Dan's medical malpractice insurance is apparently bogus.  Dan stands to loose everything, including his house, the country club membership and his tenuous marriage.  For Barry and his newfound girlfriend, the search is on to find the confidence man behind this worthless insurance policy.    The strength of this novel is not only in the clever and fast-paced storylines, but it is also found in the depth of the characters and the bonds between them.  Barry and Tildy, with all of their vulnerabilities, embark in a torrid fairytale romance.  But not far behind is the wonderful and unconditional bond between the middle-aged brothers, Dan, the doctor, and Barry, the attorney.  Their sibling devotion is nearly idyllic and very moving.  It hangs out there as something to aspire to.    The flip side of these warm and human characters is the dark side of  humankind.  The bad guys in this novel are void of compassion and conscience.  They are narcissistic and despicable.  But as always, their demise lies in the predictability of their greed and self-absorption.    This is a very enjoyable legal thriller, and it is on par with other legal novels and authors that we see on the bestsellers' lists all the time.  It's that good.	2005-06-23

This new mutual respect, between cop and capo, leads to a cave that has entombed two dead and entwined lovers for fifty years.<br />How do you solve a crime that occurred in Sicily during World War II?  The Inspector is obsessed with the case, and searches for all of the relevant clues, from former family and friends, to the meaning of the terra-cotta dog, along with the other artifacts that were found alongside of the lovers.  What follows is a very clever tale and trail of answers. <br />While this mystery unfolds, the storyline reveals the Inspector's complex human nature, and his enigmatic relationships with his girlfriend, co-workers and bosses.  The Inspector is passionate, quirky, self-righteous and egotistical.  This leads to some bizarre personal behaviors.  For example, when Montalbano, who is a cop, learns of the rape and incest of a friend, he chooses a very much out-of-bounds and non-legal method of dealing with the perp.  So much for being a cop.  <br />THE TERRA-COTTA DOG is more than a single-dimension murder mystery. It is literature-like in its look at human relations, and the realities and rationalizations that make these characters tick.  But as a murder mystery, by way of the Inspector's astute police methods, it doesn't get any better than this.	2003-12-27

This subtle humor continues as Montalbano must find a way to \\"out\\" the fact that a young, naked and dead woman is locked inside the quieted cottage.<br />The suspects include the husband of the deceased; a girlfriend; an out-of-town lover; and a quirky neighborhood admirer and sometimes stalker.  Leaving no stone unturned, even a questionable judge and some trigger-happy cops are fair game for Montalbano's investigation.<br />While solving this crime, Montalbano has girlfriend problems of his own to mend, on top of his infatuation with the girlfriend of the deceased.  Sometimes Montalbano's life is even too much for Montalbano.  These times usually call for a good Italian meal and an unplugged telephone.<br />VOICE OF THE VIOLIN is irreverent humor, with an underlining belief that \\"the end justifies the means,\\" as in half-truths, news leaks and 'anonymous' police tips.  But it is the complexity of Montalbano,  and the complexity of the whodunit storyline, along with the wonderful setting, that make this a thoughtful, enjoyable, fun and worthwhile read.	2003-12-13

Even the Witness Protection Program provides no shelter from those that are trying to find and kill her.  <br />Kristen has made allot of bitter enemies in her career as a prosecutor.  Some are hardened criminals seeking revenge; and others are federal agents that she has been openly critical of  for their failures and hypocrisy.  <br />Kristen's journey to protect herself and her daughter starts when her husband is gunned down in front of her on the streets of New Orleans.  It is a professional hit with a message that more violence will strike her.  She initially flees on her own accord, only to narrowly escape being tracked down by those seeking lethal revenge.  She reluctantly goes into the Witness Protection Program and finds that the good guys don't care much for her either.  <br />In an ironic twist, Kristen befriends a fellow protectee, a former mobster and hit man, who takes a strong interest in shielding Kristen and her daughter from the malicious powers inside and out of the Witness Protection Program.  <br />A hit man protecting against intruding hit men makes for an interesting plot and dialog between the former prosecutor and the former murderer.  The best man in Kristen's life becomes a man with a shady past and allot of notches in his belt.  But they become good friends, with her daughter even calling the capo &quot;Uncle.&quot;<br />With multiple forces trying to break Kristen's cover and kill her, the pace of this thriller is fast and furious.  All secret roads lead to a tense and explosive ending.  <br />THE PROGRAM is a fantastic read, with a somewhat dark-humor look at good and evil.  The difference between right and wrong get cleverly blurred in this one.    And the nightmare of running for safety hits a cord in the pit of your stomach.  Few works of fiction can match the psychological, visceral and adrenaline rush of THE PROGRAM.	2001-07-19

Dr. David Crone, an academic type who is clueless about the real world and the realities of his trial, seems to have had the motive and means to have killed his fellow associate, the very bright and attractive Dr. Kalista Jordan.  The murder occurred after Dr. Jordan filed a sexual harassment complaint against Dr. Crone; and similar materials used to choke Dr. Jordan were found hidden in Dr. Crone's home.  It seems all but certain that Dr. Crone is about to get a new address and a lifetime supply of orange jumpsuits. <br />Enter book series attorney Paul Madriani, and his blunt sidekick Harry Hinds, who do everything, including the courtroom two-step, to get their client freed.  Although a conviction seems certain, Madriani is conflicted and confused over the guilt and mental state of his client, Dr. Crone.  Madriani actually knew his client before the trial started, during a time when Madriani was trying to get help from Dr. Crone for a little girl who is dying of an insidious genetic disease.  Could the good professor really be a proverbial Dr. Jekle and Mr. Hyde?<br />The story pace and depth is not up to the very high book series standard of intricate plot development and complex characters racing at thrilling speeds.  And THE JURY, for some inexplicable reason, is actually missing the jury.  Descriptions of the jury, their reactions to the testimony, their dynamics among themselves and with the courtroom players, are all under developed to a point of being grossly missing from the courtroom action. We get to know the defendant, the prosecutor and the cantankerous judge, but what happened to the book namesake?  Steve Martini and his editors needed more time deliberating this one.	2001-07-17

Jackson moved to the island of Martha's Vineyard for a lifestyle change, only to find that trouble always has a way of finding him there.  A couple of Beantown mobsters show up at his home and try muscling his wife, Zee, for some information about one Tom Rimini, an apparent missing gambler who is in deep hawk with the loan sharks.  The thugs get physical with Zee, so she manages to modify their behavior by grabbing her pistol and shooting.  With one dead and one wounded, the mystery begins to unfold about who Tom Rimini is and why the Soprano types are looking for him on the island.<br />Once a cop, always a cop.  J.W. Jackson's instincts lead him to a series of clues that allow him to piece together the puzzling story of Tom Rimini and his myriad of problems, including those involving the Boston crime family.  All this while taking his kids out for an occasional ice-cream, and playing with his two cats, Velcro and Oliver Underfoot.<br />Philip Craig's books, about the adventures of J. W. Jackson and his family on Martha's Vineyard, are fun and laid back.  Yeah, there is usually a mystery to solve, in between getting stuck in the traffic jams at the A&amp;P supermarket, or the long queues at the standby auto lines at the ferry dock in Vineyard Haven.  Craig has captured the nuance and magic of sleepy Martha's Vineyard while delivering a light-hearted mystery laced with humorous dialog and usually dumb bad guys.

An international arrest warrant has been issued against former President John Harris for alleged crimes that he is said to have committed during his tenure in office.  Peru claims President Harris ordered a CIA-backed attack of a biological weapons factory that resulted in the deaths and carnage of Peruvian lives.  Under the same international treaty that foiled Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet into a long detainment in England, Peru wants the former U.S. President arrested and extradited to Peru to stand trial.<br />The former President is on board a German commercial airline, en route to Rome, when he learns of his legal problems.  Since most of the free world has signed the treaty, including the United States, it seems as though there is no place to run to.  But the former President has friends in all the right places, including the cockpit, whose captain is a U.S. Air Force reservist who has strong feelings and loyalties about defending a U.S. President, active or otherwise. <br />The hunt for a safe haven, while on board a jetliner, makes for a fast-paced and exciting drama that is irresistible to put down.  The velocity quickens, and even the headwinds build, until the plane takes the former President to his final destination.<br />This is a breakout novel of sorts for author John Nance as it has less to do about aviation, (as his fantastic previous airborne thrillers are), and more to do about the human, political and legal ironies of our times.  There are a couple of courtroom dramas that bar none, as well as insightful forays into the decision processes of the Oval Office and 10 Downing Street, both of which give new meaning to the definition of leadership.  This is pure adrenaline from takeoff to landing, and author John Nance at his very best.	2001-06-28

Since leaving the agency, Gabriel has been looking for solace in the art of restoring old great oil paintings for a London art dealer.  However, the risk of terrorism against a possible PLO/Israeli peace accord brings Gabriel back to make everything right for the world, and for his soul.     <br />The hunt is on to find Yusel al-Tawfiki, a former PLO terrorist who now believes Yasser Arafat has gone soft on too many issues.  Yusel, ironically, hates Arafat and Israeli, and if that were not enough loathing, he also has a personal vengeance against the Israeli agent, Gabriel Allen, who has been sent to destroy Yusel.  <br />The storyline runs deep with its ever unfolding sub-text.  And the characters, good and evil, have rich and compelling backgrounds with credible life circumstances.

Since being a paid assassin is not a forty-hour-a-week job, Keller also has time for a dog and an occasional romance.<br />But Keller is dead serious about his work, and thus neurotic about the details and nuances of what he does.  He meticulously plans his 'hits,' often adding a personal flare to his execution methods.  Why use a bullet when you can make a death look accidental?  And in a perverse irony, Keller has a strong sense of right and wrong, and sometimes improvises on an assignment to improve a conflicted situation as a result of his deadly deed.  What a guy.<br />HIT MAN is the premiere episode of another Lawrence Block book series.  It is slow out of the blocks, using valuable prose to set the stage for future installments. The humor gets lost in the mechanics, which is a shame as HIT MAN's sequel, HIT LIST, is a knee slapper.  This inaugural episode is worthy of a pass, while the Keller series itself is shaping up to be a fun, clever and humorous look at the life of a 'thoughtful' paid assassin.	2001-05-16

The elderly defendant, known as Pigeon Tony, openly kills fellow pigeon racer and bad man Angelo Coluzzi as a vendetta for the murderous acts that Coluzzi has done over the years to Pigeon Tony's family.  Like the Hatfields and McCoys, near war breaks out between these hot-headed families as the murder trial moves forward.<br />Lawyer Judy Carrier, with the help of her mentor and tough-minded boss Bennie Rosato, lays out a defense for her client whom she knows has committed this crime.  Her argument is going to be a tough sell to the jury.  The trial proceeds with the backdrop of the warring families, and Judy ends up being protected by Pigeon Tony's grandson, Frank, whom she romantically enjoys.<br />THE VENDETTA DEFENSE has a wonderful parallel storyline that takes place decades earlier in the 'old country,' as told through the day dreams of defendant Pigeon Tony.  These flashbacks are the coming-of-age story of Pigeon Tony in fascist Italy during the War, and his courtship and love affair with his future wife.  And these dreams tell of the sad and emotional events that sparked the years of anger and bitterness between the Italian families.<br />Author Lisa Scottoline weaves the old times with the new, and the new romances with the old, as she works a masterful courtroom drama.  And even more so than in her prior works, she uses humor, along with broken language, to energize the story and its characters.  Even the names of the players are funny: Tony Two Feet, Tony-From-Down-The-Block, Fat Jimmy, and of course the other Anthony, Pigeon Tony.  Although this book is part of a series about the all-female Philly law firm of Bennie Rosato and Associates, THE VENDETTA DEFENSE does 'stand alone,' and is a great place to start the series and enjoy a fantastic Lisa Scottoline legal thriller.	2001-05-08

The first case is the unsolved demise of Steve Buckman, a local tour guide and former resident of the City of Angels.  The bereaved widow is the client.  The second case is the challenge to rid the town of a group of organized thugs, called the Dell, who black-bag so-called protection money from Potshot's businesses.  Town leaders want the hoods removed before the desert hamlet becomes a modern-day ghost town.<br />Spenser does what Spenser does best: super sleuthing one clue at a time, with his 'ah shucks' good-old-boy, quick-witted humor, until he develops a plan and moves to solve his cases.  The plan to purge the town of the Dell calls for Spenser to mobilize many 'characters' from past Spenser episodes.  This band of misfits makes for a hilarious dialog on top of the always humorous interplay between the old boxing buddies, Spenser and Hawk.<br />Like a standup comedian who uses a news story to deliver a gag, author Robert Parker uses a detective story to deliver his best-yet comedic dialog.  (I wished the narrative would never end.)  POTSHOT is Robert Parker, and the enigmatic Spenser, at their best.	2001-05-02

Being twenty something and handsome, he is not likely to survive prison very well.  He spends his remaining hours of freedom partying with his friends into the night of New York City, and thinking about his future and his options, which are few.<br />Brogan is all ego and no remorse.  He is not concerned with crime and punishment, only about his own survival.  Brogan's self-absorbed, no-conscience, easy-money lifestyle is contrasted against his friends who have bought into the system: Frank Slattery, a young self-destructive high-roller bond trader, and Jakob Elinsky, a neurotic English school teacher who has enough guilt to cover his convicted friend's lack of any.   Three young men, three chosen paths.  None are particularly cheery or appealing.  Is there another path with a better view?<br />First-time author David Benioff does not build allot of sympathy for Monty Brogan's life and his pending destiny with prison time.  In fact, Benioff sometimes argues that it may take a prison cell for a guy like Monty to straighten out.  After all, that's the way its suppose to work in a compassionate society of rules and wardens.<br />THE 25th HOUR is a dark but lively countdown with friends and family who are about to loose someone near and dear to incarceration.  At the same time, the novel takes an insightful and existential look at the notion of crime; the prerequisite of punishment; and the outcome of redemption and change.  Although sometimes sidetracked, THE 25th HOUR is an exceptional work for this first-time author.	2001-04-29

The ad hoc women's club also becomes a support group for each other on issues of work, family, romance and illness.  Lindsay Boxer, in particular, battles to balance a blood illness, a new beau, and her passion to solve the murders. <br />When the case is finally nailed down to the Club's satisfaction, it becomes unglued as Lindsay becomes unsure as to the real killer.  Another search for the truth leads to a surprise ending, as well as to the meaning of the novel's title.  <br />The author's risk to try something new seems to have succeeded in this novel.  The 'Club' characters are likeable, enduring and memorable, just as those in the Alex Cross episodes.

But he is quickly suckered into a political vortex of murder, blackmail and sexual deceit.  <br />While on a date with Michael, Nora shakes off her Secret Service detail for the fun of it.  But the laughter ends when she and Michael think they have witnessed a crime by a White House insider.  But what do they think they have seen, and what does it mean?  As Michael starts to uncover the truth and its political consequences, powerful people set him up for the fall of his life.  As a political neophyte, Michael is an amateur among the White House powerful.<br />THE FIRST COUNSEL is fast reading out of the blocks, then slows during the middle innings, and finishes amid suspense and a surprise ending.  For a fictional work, it is an interesting and insightful look into the inner workings of the White House and the transient families that occupy it.  The storyline itself is probably not plausible, but this does not diminish the enjoyment of this political love story.	2001-03-29

But deflecting the blame for the murder to the decease's father, Donald Sales, is a defense strategy that backfires in unimaginable ways.  The loss of his daughter, and then the innuendo that he killed her, does not sit well with the Vietnam veteran.<br />The end of the trial begins the real search for the truth.  The hunt involves the local police, the FBI and a trail of other female victims.  But those being hunted are also doing some hunting of their own, and the race is on to solve these crimes before another young woman is dissected.<br />THE LETTER OF THE LAW gets off to a somewhat slow start and builds to a frenetic conclusion.  There are also some loose ends that tighter editing might have sewn up.  But as a legal thriller, it stands tall among today's popular courtroom bestsellers.	2001-03-19

Fun is listening to the radio (Harry Carey and the St. Louis Cardinals), or gossiping in town with the locals on a Saturday afternoon.   Despite below poverty living conditions, life is not all that bad for the main character, seven-year-old Luke Chandler, whose excitement for life is measured by his raw first-time experiences with growing up.  Through his innocent eyes we get excited about a fist fight or watching a river flood its banks.  Or marvel at listening to a baby being born.  Or dream with Luke about playing baseball for the Cardinals.  Everything, good or bad, is new and exciting to the seven-year-old.   <br />But when the realty of life's consequences begin to sink in, Luke begins to harden into an adult.  A bunch of literary metaphors are used to paint this message, all successful and clever.<br />A PAINTED HOUSE is a great work of American fiction.  This is not the fast pace of a John Grisham legal thriller.  However, it is the rawness of the characters and the visceral storyline that compensates for the novel's slower pace.  But, in the end, it is the seven-year-old that really holds our attention as we are reminded of our own youth and a time when we saw everything as being new and exciting for the first time.	2001-03-06

His spouse, Talia Potter, was anything but faithful, and she had several million (dollar) reasons for wanting him dead.  Talia will not be an easy client to defend, and the outcome may well be unfavorable, or at best, a judicial toss up. <br />Book series defense attorney Paul Madriani takes the case even though he has a 'nexus' with both the deceased and his client.  Given Madriani's shaky marriage, and his ties to the parties involved, this is a case he might well have passed on.  But Madriani has strong feelings for Talia, and he has a strong ego that presumes himself to be the best attorney for the job.  And of course he is right.  The court room battle is bruising, with lots of suspicion, lies, suspects and hidden agendas.  So who did it?  <br />This fast past thriller is as good as the latter Paul Madriani episodes of THE ATTORNEY and THE JUDGE.  A little dated (blood typing instead of DNA), but allot of suspense and adrenaline.	2000-12-12

The scientist, before his death, con's his ex-wife into taking a so-called 'model' of a Medusa device to the Pentagon for analysis.  A working Medusa bomb, the theory goes, would knock out all of the working computers in North America, while killing a few million people at the same time.  For the purposes of national security, the former Machiavellian husband argues that this information belongs in the hands of our military to study and defend against.  But in transit to the Nation's Capitol, the model comes alive in the belly of a Boeing 727 air cargo jet, and its inventor speaks from the grave.  <br />MEDUSA's CHILD maybe author John Nance's finest aviation thriller.  The heroes of this novel not only have to battle a bomb to survive, they have to battle horrendous weather, fuel limitations, a screwed up military, a paranoid FBI, and the limitations of their own aging 727.  One adversarial situation after another, they just keep coming.  And one after another, the pilots keep on flying.  <br />Suspense thrillers just don't get much better than this.	2000-11-29

Hiding behind the political pretense of the so-called Beirut Brigade, the thugs move their operation to the Big Apple for one last big heist.  But the Joint Task Force on Terrorism has an adversary the Brigade did not count on: Jake Malloy, a New York cop and Navy ex-Seal with a gun, strong instincts, and a belief in the Golden Rule.  Malloy puts the clues together from the various crime scenes and hunts the bad guys down in a climatic ending.

Nominated by his party, Franklin Delano Rawley is nearly scared out of the race by attempts to shut him down.  There are several individuals and groups that want him out of the race, and quickly.  The conspiracies run deep, and their motivations run deeper, as the eleventh hour approaches.<br />J. D. Cade, a successful businessman with a wild past, buys his way into the candidate's inner circle with a large donation.  Cade, a former black ops sniper during the Vietnam war, becomes close to Rawley and his campaign staff.  Maybe too close.  The watch-full eyes of the Secret Service do not like new faces with mysterious backgrounds.  A border-line agent makes it his mission in life to protect his charge by attempting to unravel the background and ulterior motives of newcomer J. D. Cade.<br />The reasons for changing the course of history are many.  Some are altruist, but most are egotistical.  Author Joseph Flynn writes about both, with some colorful variations. This is an extraordinary political thriller that is exciting but a little long winded at times.  THE NEXT PRESIDENT is timely and entertaining, especially during an election year, which seems to be every year.	2000-11-10

And in between these quirky episodes, Sunny finds the time to hang out with her ex-husband, as well as her gay friend and restaurateur, Spike, who sometimes doubles as her PI sidekick (much like monosyllabic muscleman Hawk in the ROBERT PARKER Spenser novels.)<br />Things take a turn for the worse when the client's co-worker is murdered, and Sunny's snooping services are abruptly terminated as well.  With or without a paying client, Sunny continues to follow a trail of murder, prostitution, and organized crime to solve the whodunit.  And in the end, the problems plaguing all three women get some form of poetic closure.<br />PERISH TWICE is the second Sunny Randall novel, which followed the great debut of the series premiere, HUGGER MUGGER.  HUGGER MUGGER is hilarious and clever; and the characters are often caricatures of themselves.  PERISH TWICE does not sustain what are the strengths of the first Sunny Randall novel.  Let's hope that the third installment in this neat new series will be a charm.	2000-11-01

And to make matters worse, there are similarities between this 'flash' incident, and another jumbo jet that got into trouble in the skies near Cuba.  Is this a new kind of terrorism?  Or some sort of internal sabotage?  Or maybe just a coincidence? <br />Book series heroine FBI Agent Katherine 'Kat' Bronsky is delivering a seminar on just these kinds of problems when she is pressed into service to solve and save the 'rudderless' jumbo jet and its two hundred passengers. With mysterious information provided to her by a newspaper reporter covering her seminar, she realizes evil forces, with possibly a worldwide network that rivals the capabilities and size of the FBI, are at work.  These nefarious forces quickly make her and others the hunted, instead of the hunters.<br />Just when you hope for an adrenalin let up, this best yet JOHN NANCE aviation thriller climbs to a higher level of suspense, terror and fear.  Series (swashbuckler?) character Kat Bronsky unconventional style continues to develop with this installment, along with her intelligence, wit and inventiveness.  When every situation gets worse (by the minute), she gets better.  So strap in, place your tray tables in their full upright position, and enjoy the flight.	2000-10-28

But from the get-go, someone is leading the unhappy campers down a trail of death and destruction.  And like all politicians, Governor Fielding Dawson has his share of enemies, as well as future foes.  And he probably has his share of unhappy staffers who cannot stand another adventure with a self-absorbed elected official.<br />New York City subway cop Richard Corrigan, a last minute addition to the wilderness party, does not like politicians or unpaved paths without street signs and sausage vendors.  And he does not like what his instincts are telling him about the unexplained events that are happening among his tenting group.  He shares his concerns with fellow hiker Dara Wylie, a magazine reporter, whom he enjoys towing the line with.<br />The race down BLACK MOUNTAIN is a heart-stopping adventure of survival, cunning, political mystery, and romance.  The characters have to weather the dark side of nature, and the dark side of man.  The ending unearths the truth, in a satisfying way, but leaves open the rhetorical question of which is more vicious: mankind or the BLACK MOUNTAIN.	2000-10-21

This best yet Stephanie Plum suspense thriller is a hoot from the get-go, with a dysfunctional set of characters that can't shoot straight.  Bounty hunter Plum tries to help her friend and mentor Carlos (Ranger) Manoso solve the murder of the son of an international gunrunner.  Ranger, a mercenary by training, is wanted for questioning in connection with the murder.  Stephanie's not sure whether she should 1) seduce Ranger 2) take him down for the bounty 3) or try and help him solve the whodunit.  <br />Along the way Stephanie, with her occasional side-kick Lula, bumbles a couple of bounty take downs; helps her grandmother get her driver's license (so she can buy a hot car); gets help from her spaced-out friends Mooner and Dougie (who can't get enough of 'I Dream of Jeannie' reruns from the sixties); and takes in an unwanted dog who eats everything and poops like there's no tomorrow.  Of course, the bad guys aren't much better, tailing Stephanie all day long (to get to suspect Ranger) until 5 pm when its time to take the kids to soccer practice.<br />This novel should be cataloged as a comedy rather than a suspense thriller.  Like something out of the Three Stooges or an SNL skit, this JANET EVANOVICH novel is outright hilarious!  I mean outright, as in constantly howling out loud!  The storyline, dialog, and characters are exceptional in this easy-to-read Stephanie Plum series book.  Fans, old and new, won't want to miss this read while waiting impatiently for number SEVEN.	2000-10-16

The hijacker does not want money or free passage to an extradition-free country; the perp wants another perp brought to justice for an alleged capital crime.  The irony is not lost on Kat and the others involved.<br />The tension and suspense climbs constantly until the story line lands on a clever note.

Is it related to a high-profile murder investigation?  Or to the recent carjackings in L. A.?  Or maybe a vendetta against her not-always politically correct dad?<br />Cindy's paranoia extends to her cop colleagues who think she is a holier-than-thou and arrogant ivory leaguer who does not play the police blues very well.  And just like her daddy, she is not very good at fitting in, but she is pretty good at piecing together transgressions, even those that are perpetuated against her.<br />The anchor and centering force for both daughter and father is Peter's wife, Rina Lazarus, who has wisdom and religion beyond her years.  She is also a steadying force for her kids and others that are touched by her.  Rina is low-key but direct; warm and humanly insightful.  She is a wonderful counterbalance to the world of cops and robbers.<br />The introduction of Cindy as a main character is a bold move for this series, but one that opens up many possibilities for author Faye Kellerman.  But we have come to love and enjoy fictional 'characters' Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus, so the author's argument to embrace Cindy will have to be extraordinarily strong.  The jury is still out on this, but the odds are good that Cynthia will eventually win our hearts.	2000-10-02

The police give him up for dead. <br />Cardoni's attorney, rookie Amanda Jaffe, moves onto defending other criminal types, until four years later, when she is asked to defend another surgeon for a new series of ritualistic crimes.  A copy cat?  Cardoni’s work?  A coincidence?<br />Its hard to keep track of all the good guys, bad guys, and dead people in this new novel by Phillip Margolin.  It seems like most of them have 'motive, means and opportunity' to sport these crimes.  In the end, clarity produces a chilling conclusion.<br />This is, by far, Mr. Margolin's most dark, graphic and gory novel.  And it is also one of his more intense works, with a frenetic pace and a palette of bi-polar psychopaths with scary tendencies.  WILD JUSTICE, in part, is a wild ride through the sadistic side of criminal human nature.	2000-09-26

President Jack Ryan flexes foreign trade sanctions as a show of resolve and morality, but to no avail.<br />THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is slow to unfold; then gets exciting in the last few hundred pages; and then abruptly ends.

Their personalities are  loony as ever, even though the book series baton has been passed from  writer Lawrence Sanders, who sadly died, to Vincent Lardo.  For the most  part Mr. Lardo has made a smooth transition, although his portrayal of some  of the characters differs somewhat from Mr. Sanders.  <br />Rather than dwell  on what is missing, much has been added, such as a Hamlet-like play within  a play.  Its cute and boorish, which is part of the spirit of this series.   Kudos for Mr. Lardo for maintaining the fun while 'trying out' some new  stuff with the bunch from route A1A.	2000-08-29

There  are fields for such things as daily weather conditions, as well as your  daily conditions (pounds and pulse rate), and it also has a section for  keeping track of your 'racing results'.  There is a 'quick diary' section  at the beginning of the log to keep track of a year's worth of miles on two  pages.<br />Through thick and thin (skinny and fat), and slow and fast (lots  of PR's, no more PR's), this diary has been a constant companion.

This second installment opens with a boat race that ends almost  tragically in the wake of several dead gray whales.  Speeding along at more  than 100 knots, Kurt, and his fearless sidekick, Joe Zavala, use their  ingenuity to escape a near-death collision.
