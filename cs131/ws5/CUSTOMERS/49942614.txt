US	49942614	R2EQTV7YYWSTKC	0765303671	340488847	Spaceland: A Novel of the Fourth Dimension (Tom Doherty Associates Books)	Books	4	31	31	N	N	Interesting yet confused	A sequel, of sorts, to Edwin Abbott's classic novel, 'Flatland'. Joe Cube is a high tech executive waiting for his company to be IPOed. One night, while playing with his company's product (a TV screen that turns standard television broadcasting into a 3D image), Joe is contacted by Momo, a creature from the fourth dimension. Momo 'augments' Joe, giving him the ability to see into the fourth dimension, and also the ability to see into our dimension using a four dimension perspective. This gives Joe the unique ability of seeing inside people and objects, naturally, Joe tries to use this to make money... Momo only asks (demands, to be more exact) that Joe start a company that will create a specific product that she will supply. The plot gets complicated when another race of four-dimensional creatures, the Wackles, seem intent on  stopping Joe. What is going on? Try the book and see.<BR><BR>This sounds like a very cool premise and it really is. The author truly captured the feeling of a 4D universe, a 3D universe from a 4D perspective, as well as a one dimensional and a two dimensional universe. The book is worth reading if only for this.. or perhaps, only for this: The book suffers from the worst characterization I've ever read in a book. The characters are completely unbelievable, obnoxious, annoying, self-contradicting. They are ridiculous. It feels like a cartoon of a cartoon. Maybe that was the purpose? I've never read any other book by the author, so I can't really say if it's his style. It's a pity, because the book could've been so much better. At the end I couldn't stand any of the characters (including the protagonist). Another weakness is the plot itself: Until the middle of the book it's really quite a good story, but then the quality goes downhill from there.. Shame. I'm giving the book 4/5 stars, but if I could, 3.5/5 would be more appropriate.	2004-03-06

This one really didn't live up to my expectations. Why? Well, most stories were either unoriginal, or started nice but the ending was completely predictable. This was, literally, a collection of boring stories. I think one of the things I like about time travel books, is that the ending can be really tricky - there are so many ways such stories can have a punch line, and even after reading many of these books I still find myself surprised most of the time. Sadly, it wasn't the case with this collection of stories..<BR>There was only one story which was more or less okay, &quot;Blood Trail&quot;, about a police officer who is sent in time to try and find the identity of a serial killer. The officer is not allowed to change anything, but he CAN try and gather information about the killer which will enable catching him in the present. However, the officer really, really doesn't like to see people killed in front of his eyes...<BR>To summarize: if you have nothing else on your list, go for it, or even if you just MUST read every time travel book you can find (like me). However, don't expect anything above average, and most stories don't even live up to that.	2002-08-26

In fact, I dedicated an entire day to just sit at home and read it (I haven't done this in years!). Imagine, UFOs are really not extraterrestrial vehicles but are actually time machines used by historians from the future who want to study the past. Sounds good, even if somewhat unoriginal, no? Well, the entire book was a mixture of good ideas, but the end product was bad. It's as if the author couldn't make up his mind what he wanted to write about. Time Travel, aliens, paradoxes: these all sound like good ingredients, but SOMEHOW Mr. Steele has managed to get it very, very wrong.<BR>The plot: Franc Lu, a 24th century historian, is being sent back in time to view what happened on the Hindenburg: witness first hand the destruction and what caused it. But somehow, he makes some changes, causing history to diverge and a paradox to be created. A parallel storyline tells about David Zachary Murphy, a scientist working for NASA at the end of the 20th century. David came up with the (correct) theory that UFOs are really time machine. How do both these threads join together? Just barely, and not in an interesting way. Read the book if you want to find out.<BR>To summarize: I DON'T recommend this book. There are far better time travel stories, which cover very similar ideas in a superior way. (check out Joshua Dann's books if you want a glimpse). The reason I'm not giving this book one star is because it did capture my attention for about a third of the book, I was still convinced it might turn out to be a decent one, until this hope shattered.	2002-06-23

The basic premise of \\"Digital Biology\\" is that biological systems (brains, plants, insects, etc) were \\"designed\\" in a certain way because there was an inherent advantage to this design. Therefore, if we can understand the principles behind the design, we can take these techniques and use them in our software and hardware.<BR>Many things in nature seem as if they have no reason behind them - however, as the book illustrates, there are certainly valid, good reasons. An example would be neural networks: since our brain uses this instead of hard coded rules and programming, it is much more flexible. It can learn by trial an error the \\"best\\" approach, something traditional algorithms cannot do as efficiently. By taking this mechanism we can create very sophisticated - almost intelligent - programs and robots.<BR>There are numerous chapters in \\"Digital Biology\\", each dedicated to a specific subject. Each chapter begins by explaining how a specific biology mechanism works (i.e., the chapter on \\"immune systems\\" gives a short tutorial on how the body's immune system works). Then, different ways that similar mechanisms are used in artificial applications are demonstrated.<BR>Among the most interesting chapters:<br />\\"Evolution\\", this chapter elaborates on the principles of Evolution and how they can be used in Computation. What are Evolutionary Algorithms ? What are Genetic Algorithms? What is Genetic Programming? Evolvable Hardware, and more.<br />\\"Brains\\" - this chapter was FASCINATING. It started with a short introduction of how we believe brains work, and how these principles can be a foundation for AI and ALIFE: by using Neural Networks.<br />\\"Insects\\"- Insects are interesting because in many ways a group of insects acts as one larger organism. Sometimes many simple organisms can form one fairly intelligent \\"Creature\\". There are ways to use these techniques in computation as well, as this chapter shows. (Swarm Intelligence, Boids, etc)<br /><BR>Overall this is a very interesting book. It covers a lot of subjects, yet does NOT go too deeply into any of those - I don't think that was the purpose of the author. My main criticism is the way the book was written - some chapters are very raw, the examples chosen could've been better. (I think my favorite one was where the immune system is being compared to the music industry, and antibodies are compared to boy bands. Probably the strangest analogy I have read in my life). I also think that there was too much emphasis on real biology, especially since in many subjects there was no analogy in digital biology. Nonetheless, if the idea of using biological mechanisms in software or hardware appeals to you, this should serve as a fascinating introduction.	2002-06-19

I've started this book really suspicious: \\"Is Ray Kurzweil going to be one of those 'Visionaries' who predict we'll have nanotechnology in two years, flying cars in three years, and immortality in four years?\\". While reading this book I both realized that Ray Kurzweil really is a 'visionary', however, this is not necessarily a bad thing. <BR>In \\"The age of spiritual machines\\" Kurzweil surveys many technologies which he believes might turn out to be major technologies of the future: Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Life, Virtual Reality, Nanotechnology, and more. He tries to estimate where are we, the human species headed to, and backs all of this with very current scientific research. The second half of the book is like a series of interviews with a \\"person\\" of the future, each done in intervals of 10 years (2009, 2019, 2029 and 2099). Each depicts a certain future, at least the way Kurzweil imagines it would be. Like other reviewers have written, I believe Kurzweil is way, way, too optimistic in his time estimates. However, I do believe many of his predictions are basically right, and the way he threaded all of these various technologies into one believable future (actually, four) is truly astounding. This book was very engaging, written in a clear language. And considering the various technologies and sciences that are mentioned, this is quite an accomplishment.<BR>I don't say this often, but I do believe this book will stay with me long after I have finished it, the possibilities and futures described are inspiring and stimulating. While Mr. Kurzweil might have been wrong in a few details, and certainly in his time estimates, I believe the gist of things yet to come is in this book. VERY highly recommended.	2002-05-28

I've heard about \\"True Names\\" a few years ago and was really intrigued, however, I could not find this book anywhere. Therefore, I was delighted to see that it's out again - I didn't check what else is on the <BR>book, however, it would probably not have made a difference.<BR><br />\\"True Names\\" is basically a medium sized story which was (apparently) groundbreaking at the time it was written (1981). In addition to this story, the book contains many articles by known figures in related areas. <BR>So what is \\"True Names\\" about ? Roger Pollack, aka Mr. Slippery, is what is called a warlock. However, he's not the type of warlock of fantasy worlds, he is a warlock of \\"The Other Plane\\" (the name Vinge uses for Cyberspace.. simply because Cyberspace has not been coined at the time the book was written). There are a lot of similarities between the two types of warlocks, Mr. Slippery has special powers because of his great knowledge of The Other Plane. Mr. Slippery also is a member of a coven of warlocks, the greatest one in The Other Plane. These people are generally good natured, but are known to cause mischief every now on then. Roger's world crumbles around him when the FBI finds his true name (they discover his secret identity). The offer him a chance to get a reduced sentence by exposing his coven, or more specifically, expose a specific member, The Mailman, whom they believe is trying to take over the world. But the FBI does not know how much they are right, and how much the situation is more dangerous than they think.. only Mr. Slippery and Erythrina, another witch from his coven, have any chance of stopping this danger before it is too late.<br />I'm sure this story sounds great to you - well it is! I really enjoyed reading it, and it was interesting to see how many of Vinge's predictions have come true.<br />In addition, there are many articles in the book: among them<BR>* Tim May's LONG article about Cryptography. Very interesting article, however, its relevance to the story is fairly small, and it is way too long.<BR>* Pattie Maes' article about the future of intelligent software. Short article, yet very interesting<BR>* Richard Stallman's very short story and commentary about free reading and software. Very interesting article.<BR>* Chip Morningstar and Randall Farmer's article about Habitat, the first online multi-user game. Fascinatting! So interesting to see the great ancestor of EverQuest and Muds. Also very relevant to \\"True Names\\". and there were more.. <BR><BR>To summarize: while the articles were interesting, they were not interesting enough to buy without the actual story, and some were simply just barely related to \\"True Names\\" which was frustrating, because it made me think this was just an excuse to fill up pages. Nonetheless, the entire book is worth it because \\"True Names\\" is an excellent story, and the articles are still interesting. Just don't be embarrased to skip something if it bores you, because there are quite a lot of articles and a fairly short story in between...	2002-05-19

The main character, Ernest, reminiscences how his family/clan, which was led by his father, discovered fire, domesticated dogs, invented the first bow, drew the first cave drawings, and more. Even though this <BR>family lived thousands and thousands of years ago, they weren't so different from us. In fact, what I particularly liked about this book is that the main characters, while still ape-men, are talking and thinking like modern people. Ernest's father and his uncle keep arguing how &quot;Modern Technology&quot; (i.e., fire) is dangerous, and how maybe they should go back to the trees. Despite that, they are STILL ape-men: when Ernest's brother finds a wife, Ernest keeps thinking how amazingly fat she is - meaning, truly gorgeous! <BR>Even though this book was very humoristic, it was also intellectually stimulating. It offered some very interesting points about how many things which are the cornerstones of human life started. All this is presented in a truly hilarious way.<BR> I wholeheartly recommend this book for anyone, especially if you're a bit interested on how the human species was at the very beginning. Absolutely a wonderful book - I wish I could see this as a movie.	2002-04-28

Typical to an O'reilly book, this book is not a bad introduction to Java Server Pages (JSP). It teaches the basics: what is a JSP, what is a Servlet, how to use them, what are the best practices for JSPs, etc. In my opinion it provides a fairly comprehensive tutorial. There is also a chapter about a design model (the MVC model) which the author recommends. However, despite all this I still do not recommend this book. Despite the fact that &quot;Java Server Pages&quot; seems to be a very comprehensive introduction for JSPs, it really isn't. Why do I say this? Three main reasons: First thing, the author uses his  classes all across the book, which makes it somewhat useless for the developer seeking to see how to deal with <BR>programming issues. All it teaches you is how to use the author's classes - but nothing besides!! With all due respect, this is a book about JSPs, not about O'reilly classes - and using premade classes considerbly hinders learning!<BR>Second, the author seems to forget there are many ways of using JSPs and almost exclusively focuses on Java Beans. Well, I have been using JSPs for almost two years now, commercially, and WE DON'T USE JAVA BEANS. It's not that I'm saying it is a wrong approach, but it isn't the ONLY approach - which is what the author continuously states. Last, the author was using Tomcat, so there were Tomcat configuration tutorials all over the book. Since I don't use Tomcat (and I assume, many other people don't use it either), I felt as spending so much space on Tomcat was a waste. It would've been better if fewer subjects were covered, but examples on more Application Servers were given. (Similar to &quot;More Servlets&quot; by Marty Hall which gave each example for 3-4 different servers).<BR><BR>To summarize: I believe that there are better books than this one, however, it does teach the basic technology. After reading the book I can definitely say I learned new things - however, I would still recommend turning to another JSPbook.	2002-04-26

In Neil Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" series, Lucifer Morningstar - the devil - was a fairly minor character. During the \\"Sandman\\" series Lucifer lost his wings, resigned from hell and went on to pursue other unknown activities. In \\"Devil in the Gateway\\" we finally learn what happened to him - that he started running a nightclub in LA. \\"Devil in the Gateway\\" contains three stories. <br /> The first one tells us how Lucifer is being contracted - by none other than God almighty himself - to eliminate some ancient competition: terminate some <BR>primordial gods. I think this was an interesting story, but it didn't have Neil Gaiman's \\"magic\\". It just didn't have \\"it\\". <BR> <br /> The second story tells about Lucifer's encounter with an angel - an encounter which gives strange superpowers to a mortal. Again, this was an OK story, but I didn't find it to be particularly good. <br /> The third - and the shortest - story tells about a young girl who has magical powers. Lucifer barely <br />appears in this story. Nevertheless this one was my favorite story - it was a definite improvement over the previous two. <br /> All of these stories tie in together - but this pretty much happens in the next graphic novel. Overall, the stories were good, but felt unfocused, vague - and sometimes just plain cryptic. Even though this is Neil Gaiman's world, Mike Carey did not capture its spirit successfully. I was hesitating <BR>whether to continue with the series, but (as I later found out) it is totally worth it. I recommend this graphic novel mainly because the sequel is much better!	2002-04-25

Worthy of being in the "Sandman" universe.	\\"Children and Monsters\\" starts exactly where \\"Devil in the Gateway\\" ended: after Lucifer finished doing God's quest, he received a gate into the void - a place outside of creation. That is the main storyline of this novel.  This graphic novel also contains three parts:<BR><br /> The first story tells how Lucifer journies into the Japanese dimension of death. As we found out in the previous novel, the Japanese goddess of Death obtained Lucifer's wings (which were torn off him). Thus, Lucifer embarks on a quest to get back his wings. I loved this part! If I didn't know, I could've sworn Neil Gaiman wrote this part.. it really felt as if it belonged in the \\"Sandman\\" universe.<BR><br /> The second story is above an immortal girl who was born thousands of years ago, yet can't die because she was cursed by her gods for not getting an abortion.<BR><br /> The third story unites the previous novel with the first two parts of this one.. Lucifer comes back with his wings and wants to enter the void, only to have an army of angels try and stop him. All the previous threads come together here.<BR><br />I think this graphic novel was much better than the previous one. It definitely feels more and more like an extension of the original \\"Sandman\\" series. If this level continues - I am definitely going to stay till the end! Highly Recommended!	2002-04-25

I've never worked in Silicon Valley (even though I have worked in NYC's Silicon Alley), but still, this book rang so true. The book doesn't really have a main character, but instead focuses on the tales of a few people. Paul Armstrong: a programmer, Liz Toulouse: the liberal arts graduate who tries to work in high tech, Steve Hall: the free bits hacker (Free Bits = Open Source), and Barry Dominic: the CEO of a multinational technical company, TeraMemory. The plot covers a period in the life of these characters in the crazy events which took place around 1999-2000 - the internet bubble era. As part of the story we get to see the environment, coworkers, workplaces of the main characters - the author has truly captured the essence of these. But more than just a very accurate portrayal of the time, &quot;Silicon PFollies&quot; is simply a funny book!<BR><BR>I guess people who have never worked in high tech might not get all the inside jokes (I'm not sure I got all of them either), but I believe they will still enjoy a very amusing book - and get some of what it meant to be a part of the internet craze - I couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic as I read about the CEO's &quot;motivational speeches&quot;..<BR><BR> The dot.com period might've been an illusion, but it still was quite an experience for me - and I think this book relays that feeling quite well. Highly recommended!	2002-04-05

I've always seen those Groo comic books, yet never bought one (figuring I don't know the background, etc, so I won't understand it fully). So yesterday, when I saw a Groo graphic novel lying around in my local comic book store, I knew I had to buy it. What can I say? It was worth the wait!<br /><br />The plot: Groo is a mighty warrior, a barbarian, who just roams the earth with his loyal dog, looking for adventure and trouble. The thing is, Groo is really, really, quite stupid. In this graphic novel, Pipil Khan, a tyrant whose schemes were foiled many times by Groo, is on his death bed. Pipil Khan, however, declares he won't name his heir because he keeps being tormented by memories of Groo. So he issues a quest for his three sons: the son who brings the head of Groo, will be the named heir. So, Etrufio, a great warrior, Ogamio, a great wizard, and Relmihio, a great schemer, start hunting for Groo. The plot gets complicated by the fact that Groo's tales by now reached mythological stature, and everyone think of him as a six headed giant - nobody really knows how he looks like, and also because Groo is just too plain stupid to know somebody actually wants to kill him..<br />This leads to a very amusing tale..<br /><br />I wholeheartily recommend this graphic novel, it was very amusing - and I definitely will be reading more about Groo's adventures.	2002-04-03

In all the science fiction I ever read (and that's what I mainly read!), I cannot remember reading anything which resembles \\"Brother Termite\\". The plot is so surreal, yet is written with such talent that it totally seems plausible. <BR><BR>As for the plot: somewhere in the middle of the 20th Century, Aliens - small, gray skinned with large eyes - have landed on Earth. Using treachery they have gained control of Earth. However, most people don't really realize that the President is really a puppet in the hand of the Aliens, as well as the CIA and the FBI. Most people don't realize that the aliens are also plotting genocide against the human race. The entire story is told from the perspective of Reen, the chief of staff of the white house, and the effective ruler of the planet. Reen is a \\"Cousin\\", which is the word the Aliens use when they refer to themselves. The time is roughly the end of the of the 20th Century, and there is great turmoil in the world. Humans hate the Cousins, and vice Versa. and everybody - Everybody has a secret agenda. It all starts when many \\"Cousins\\" start vanishing and dying. Something is going on, and Reen and his fellows can't understand what is happening. There is definitely a conspiracy, but who is behind it? the CIA? the FBI? other Aliens? You'll have to read the book to find out.<BR><BR>I really couldn't put the book down from the moment I started, although I really had to concentrate to fully grasp what is going on. Not all the plot elements are explained, and much is discovered in stages. Many things happen constantly, many small details occur. That's what made the reading fun. It was also nice to see the way the author put real political figures into the plot (J. Edgar Hoover, John F. Kennedy).<BR>However, I have rarely encountered such a bleak, depressing book. I recommend science fiction fans who love politics to try this book - but be warned, this is far from light reading.	2002-03-02

I really hesitated whether I would give it a chance after I read \\"The Mind Pool\\" by Charles Sheffield, which started excellent, but ended as a big mess. But then I saw that people had given \\"Tommorow and Tommorow\\" such good reviews, and I figured Charles Sheffield deserves another chance.<BR><BR>The book started really well: the story is set at the end of the 20th century and tells about Drake Merlin, a musician and a composer. Drake and his wife, Ana, live a happy life. Both do not pursue money or power but instead concentrate on their professions (Ana is a singer), and live in bliss. But this doesn't last for too long, as Ana contracts a strange and lethal disease, leading to her death in a fairly short period of time. Drake is heartbroken, but decides not do despair. He contacts a company called \\"Second Chance\\", and freezes Ana in a cryotomb - hoping that sometime in the future technology would be high enough to revive her and cure whatever she has. Afterwards, Drake works for a few years, collecting knowledge which he figures would be very useful in the future as well as making money so he could afford keeping Ana frozen for a long period of time, and also afford to freeze himself. Drake hopes that in some time in the future, both of them will be revived, Ana be cured, and they can continue their life. His love for Ana is really strong, and he is determined not to give up. The time comes, and Drake is frozen - only to be awaken 500 years in the future, in a totally changed society. <BR><BR>This is but one of the many times Drake will be frozen only to be woken up in the yet farther future.. things have not gone as smoothly as Drake had hoped..<BR><BR>This took exactly one half of the book, and was really fantastic. The author built a completely believable future (actually, several futures), and the story was very captivating:<BR>I totally thought I had misjudged Charles Sheffield, and couldn't put this book down. <BR>However...<BR>Then Drake wakes up, and the book takes a very strange twist. Apparently in the very, very distant future, Drake (as an \\"ancient and primitive human\\") will be needed to save the descendants of the human race, as they are fighting for their survival against a force from outside our galaxy which cannot be fathomed. Drake must take control, find out what is the problem, and then solve it. Other reviewers commented on the accuracy of the science in this part. I agree. However, it is still very boring. For me it was a distraction of the main story, and frankly, I think this shouldn't have been put in this book. I read the entire second half of the book in one long evening, because I really wanted to get to the end, which wasn't very satisfying (but better than not reading the end at all). I really wanted to see whether Drake and Ana will be united.<br /><BR>To summarize this book: first part is really good, but the second part might disappoint you. Overall it is still definitely worthy of a read.	2002-02-24

Lee must find out how to protect herself, and if possible, destroy Bonito! <BR> The book really had so much potential, pity the plot was so unimaginative, and apparently mainly served to bring to print some of the sexual fantasies of the author. To summarize: bad and boring - Check out 'Axiomatic' of Greg Egan, as I could see there some of the elements of this book, written in a much better way.	2002-01-14
US	49942614	R33B8ABOIL7FM1	0312876939	631611062	End of An Era	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Fantastic Science Fiction Novel!!!	The last book I read by Robert J. Sawyer was &quot;Calculating God&quot;, which I think was a phenomenal book. Hoping for another book on the same level, I got &quot;End of an Era&quot;. It's quite uncommon that an author writes two superb novels in a row - however, this time Robert J. Sawyer absolutely did it! &quot;End of an Era&quot; was a fantastic, fabulous story and I enjoyed every minute I spent reading it. It contains everything a good science fiction story should have: a great idea, great writing, face pace, hard science, and themes which remain with you long after you finish the book. And believe me, you won't forget this book for a while. <BR><BR>As for the plot: Brandon Thackery, a Canadian Paleontologist (sounds familiar? his previous protagonist from &quot;Calculating God&quot; was also a Canadian Paleontologist) is being offered the chance of a life time: go back in time 65 million years, and actually witness the dinosaurs - and hopefully, see what killed them. Along with Brandon comes his best friend/nemesis (he stole Brandon's wife) Miles &quot;Klicks&quot; Jordan. Once they arrive to the past, they are surprised to find a few unexpected things.. First, Earth's gravity is about a 1/3 of what it should be. Second, there is a second moon to the Earth. Third, and most surprising, the earth is populated by enigmatic aliens, which apparently can control the dinosaurs. I am sure you're already intrigued, and trust me, this book promises AND delivers!<BR><BR>In my opinion, this book would literally appeal to everyone: for those who like action and adventure, as well as those who love serious themes. The book continues the ideas started in &quot;Calculating God&quot;, although is a bit lighter and less serious. To summarize: terrific book - can't wait for the next Robert J. Sawyer book who has already become one of my favorite authors.	2002-01-14
US	49942614	RCUHSVHU1RHBJ	0553288105	229605670	The Gods Themselves	Books	5	142	144	N	N	Wonderful!	It's been a while since I read any of Asimov's books - the Foundation series has always been one of my favorite science fiction series. Therefore, I decided to read another classic of Asimov (or at least, so I've been told). &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; didn't surprise me, yet I was also surprised. Why? Well, the book was terrific, definitely one of Isaac Asimov's greatest novels. But also, I was surprised to see such an amazing description of a fascinating alien society - Asimov usually does not like to write about aliens (at least, that's the impression I've gotten from reading his books), but the &quot;alien part&quot; of the book was SO good, and so well conceived and written, it made me wish Asimov would've written more books in this style.<BR><BR>What is the book about? The book contains 3 parts, each is actually a separate story which revolve around the same theme. <BR>The first part tells the story of Dr. Peter Lamont, a physicist, which recalls how the &quot;Electric Pump&quot;, a device which enables receiving a near-infinite amount of energy as a result of matter transferral between our universe, and another universe which has different laws of nature. Lamont finds that this device might destroy our solar system, and this story depicts his attempt to stop the pump. I really liked this story. It's written in typical Asimov style: witty, humorous and totally brilliant.<BR><BR>The second part tells the story of Odeen, Dua and Tritt - an alien &quot;Triplet&quot; (3 beings which are a family). These aliens live in the other universe and the story describes what happens on this side of the pump (as a result of the events from part one). As I mentioned before, this part was truly amazing. I wish Asimov had written more books about this world, as he created such a fascinating universe. You have to read it to see what I mean.<BR><BR>The third and final part, tells the story of Denison, a scientist which also appeared in the first part, and as a result of events which occured there, moved to the moon. I found this part a bit boring. This part resolves the story lines from parts one and two.<BR><BR><BR>I wholeheartly recommend this book, if only for the second part. Asimov being a professor, this book is filled with real science in a way which integrates with the plot and supports it (contrary to &quot;technobabble&quot; use of science) - this is one of the reasons the book is so good. The only thing which bothered me a bit, is that the first and second parts aren't really resolved on their own, meaning, the story ends only after the third part is over. This disappointed me, because these really were the best parts of the book and I felt somewhat cheated that I could not see how the protagonists reacted to what happened in the end. Nevertheless, this only detracts a little from the book which is still a masterpiece.	2002-01-14
US	49942614	RQRTEAORI47U0	0380973650	337033298	American Gods	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Brilliant and Complex.	How can I review a book such as 'American Gods'? Well, let my say that this is Neil Gaiman's deepest and most impressive work I have read. I read many of his tales, and I believe that there is no author who has his talent for creating modern legends, and modern mythologies. So saying it's his best book should give you a rough idea how much I liked this book.<br /><br />'American Gods' has a main story, and a back story. The main storyline evolves around Shadow, an ex-con who is hired by an enigmatic character called Wednesday to be his bodyguard. It takes Shadow some time to realize it, but apparently Wednesday is trying to enlist many odd people all around America for a war.. these people, Shadow finds out, are in fact the old gods from various mythologies. The war is a war of old gods against the new gods... gods of the media, computers and the internet. I would not elaborate much on this storyline, because I don't want to ruin it.<br /><br />The back story examines ideas which Neil Gaiman likes to explore.. what is belief? what are gods? what happens to gods when there is not so much belief anymore? The book is filled with ideas and characters from so many mythologies.. I'm sure I missed many of these anecdotes, most are not explained at all. This creates such a deep background.<br /><br />The book has such a feeling of loss, of old passing away, and new things waiting for their own demise..  this held me captivated, I could not put the book down until I finished it.<br /><br />To summarize: I wholeheartly recommend this book - but beware, as it is definitely not light reading.	2001-12-15

This book is a bit different than the rest of the discworld series, it starts when the leader of the assassins guild gets contracted (by some mysterious entities) to make the Hogfather &quot;vanish&quot;. The Hogfather is Discworld's equivalent of Santa, and Hogwatch is the extremely similar version of Christmas. The next thing we see in the book is Death (yes, Discworld's lovable Grim Reaper) acting instead of the Hogfather, that is, going from house to house to fill up stockings, putting little boys on his lap and saying Ho Ho Ho. The rest of the book kind of reads like a mystery novel: how did this happen? why does Death fill up for the Hogfather? I was very immersed in the book, and couldn't wait till the conclusion.<BR><BR><BR>As usual, the result is very witty and is truly hilarious. Towards the rest of the book it became more serious and philosophical, which added another layer of depth to the book. The same ideas which underly &quot;Hogfather&quot; also appear in &quot;Small Gods&quot;, and partially in &quot;Pyramids&quot;. The fact that the Discworld series always have such an insight into many aspects of being human has always been one of the factors which makes it much more than just a regular fantasy/humor series (a la Piers Anthony), and that's why &quot;Hogfather&quot; is such a great book.<BR><BR><BR>If you love the Discworld (or even if you just &quot;like&quot; it), this book is really for you.	2001-11-11

As a relatively new fan of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series, I was so impressed by what he wrote so far I started to believe that everything from the series will be brilliant and excellent. Therefore, despite the fact other books sounded better, I picked \\"Pyramids\\" at random. And also because<BR>... All I can say is, even the best writers can make mistakes now and then - and that I will be more careful next time.<BR><BR>About the book: Pyramids is set in Djelibeibey, which is the Discworld equivalent of Ancient Egypt. The main character is Teppic, the son of the Pharaoh who gets sent to Assassin's school in Ankh-Morpork for a few years, only to come back exactly when his father dies and he becomes the new Pharoah of the kingdom. The plot gets complicated by the building of a pyramid which is bigger than any pyramid which has ever been built in the kingdom. This pyramid somehow twists the rules of space, time and belief to create a big mess. <BR><BR>Does this sound a big vague? To me it does - and the story feels confused and vague to the end. Many plot lines aren't fully explored, many characters aren't fully developed.. the plot is very thin, it feels as if it leads nowhere. Even the jokes in the book weren't as witty as the other Discworld novels I have read. It's a pity since the premise has a lot of potential, and Teppic is cool as the main character. <BR><BR>What can I say, I guess Pratchett is human after all, even great authors can do less than perfect every now and then. Was I disappointed? Yes. Will I continue to read more Pratchett novels? You bet! I guess I would recommend this book only to people who are absolutely die hard fans of Discworld.. for anybody else I would say, Skip this one.	2001-10-09
US	49942614	R23J9PCV6P7HHP	0743423909	613495349	Cronos	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Three excellent stories which capture the wonder of Sci-Fi.	I don't know what is it about modern science fiction, but I haven't read a fantasy or a science fiction book in a quite while which gave me this feeling of wonder. If you don't know what I mean, try reading the &quot;Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book somehow managed to capture this long lost feeling - and not only once, but three times! Time Travel stories have always been a favorite of mine, so I was delighted to find a collection of three medium sizes time travel stories.<br /><br />The first story, &quot;Letters from Atlantis&quot; tells about Roy, who is sent 20,000 years back in time. However, Roy does not travel physically - only his mind makes the journey. Upon getting to the past he finds himself inside the mind of the prince of Atlantis (which hasn't been destroyed yet) - and what he sees greatly surprises him... I'm not going to reveal any of the plot, just that it's a good story - even though it's my least favorite of the three.<br /><br />The second story, &quot;Project Pendulum&quot;, is definitely my favorite one. It tells about twin brothers who are sent to a journey through time. However, since matter has to be preserved, whenever one is in the future, the other must be exactly in an identical &quot;amount of time&quot; in the past (So, for example, when the first brother is 50 years in the future, the other brother is exactly 50 years in the past). The way their journey works, is that they increase their interval by 10. The first brother is being sent 5 minutes forward, when the second brother is sent 5 minutes backward, and then the first brother goes 50 minutes forward, and so on: 500 minutes, 5000 minutes, 50,000 minutes, etc. This interval goes to 90 million years in the future and in the past, which is when their journey ends. As you can imagine, since the brothers explore a myriad of timelines, every jump is a story of its own. Robert Silverberg really managed to do it well - he kept every jump interesting while still not repeaeting himself.<br /><br />The third story, &quot;The Time Hoppers&quot;, has a definite Asimovian feel to it. If you liked Isaac Asimov's &quot;The End of Enternity&quot; you will definitely love this story. The story tells about Quellen - a lowly crime investigator living in the 25th century. Appaerntly, the 25th century turns into quite a dystopia. Too many people and too few jobs cause most people to live unemployed and in quite bad conditions. Many have found that the best way to escape this is to jump into the past. However, the government isn't all too happy about this, so assigns Quellen to investigate how this is accomplished and put a stop to this.<br /><br />Three different stories, all quite different, but all good - I recommend this book to all time travel lovers, and even if you're not really a fan of this sub-genre, you will still probably like these stories.still not repeaeting himself. <BR><BR><BR>The third story, &quot;The Time Hoppers&quot;, has a definite Asimovian feel to it.

US	49942614	R2KH4DHV40KL1Z	0380770237	302223171	Lord Demon	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Easy to tell Zelazny didn't finish this himself...	What can I say, I'm a BIG fan of Zelazny - However, this book is NOT really a Roger Zelazny Novel.<BR> The books starts like a classical novel by the master: Kai Wren, a Demon, also called &quot;Lord Demon&quot; because he's the only demon to ever kill a god in a one on one combat, finds that his personal servant has been murdered. The murder investigation causes him to suspect that there is more than meets the eye to this affair, and that the entire Demon-God status quo is in danger. <BR> What I love about this book, and all of Roger Zelazny's book, is that there's a new &quot;mythology&quot; in them. The worlds described in his novels are filled with their own legends, their own creatures and<BR>myths. Nevermind that so many of those are repeated again and again in these novels (&quot;Lord Demon&quot; reminded me a lot of Amber's second series - books 6 to 10). <BR> For example, in &quot;Lord Demon&quot;, Kai Wren is also a bottle maker. However, his bottles aren't just bottles: they take centuires to complete and can<BR>have an entire universe contained inside them! <br /> If it's all so great, why did I give the book only 3 stars? <BR> Well, the book starts really well, but then it loses all of its momentum, it turns into a definite non Zelazny novel (Dimensions of socks? Dimensions of Coat Hangers? COME ON!!!), and the end is stupid, not to mention boring. I'm sure if Zelazny wrote it from beginning to end it would've been a masterpiece - as well as a<BR>beginning of an awesome new series. But the way it is right now, the book promises a lot, but does not keep its promise.<BR>My final verdict: read it, but expect to be highly disappointed halfway through the book. However if you're a Roger Zelazny fan - read it, you'll probably still love (most of) it.	2001-08-30

However, I really did not like its sequels - they were very different from the original, and did not appeal much to me. So when I heard about Ender's Shadow I had mixed feelings. Will it capture &quot;Ender's game&quot;'s essence? Or will it be like the sequels? and how much can this story be retold, anyway? Surprisingly, more than once! <BR> Ender's Shadow tells the story of Bean, who had a small role in the original book. But there really isn't a lot of overlap. The book begins with Bean's rough childhood in the streets of Rotterdam, how he grew in a gang and every day was a struggle for life, and it continues when he gets to Battle School and meets Ender Wiggin. Even though many of the events are already chronicled in Ender's Game, the perspective is so different that it is possible to forget this is a story which was already told before. Bean is a genius - but Bean is no Ender, so their perspectives vary greatly. Ender's Shadow is much more analytical, much more of a psychological novel. I think Ender's Shadow is not as good as Ender's game, but still very, very worthy of a read - although only if you've read Ender's Game before. It is definitely Orson Scott Card at his best - the writing is simply brilliant. One last point, I agree with some other reviewers who said that Ender's Shadow takes a bit from Ender's Game. We see that Ender wasn't as brilliant as we thought he was (even if still more brilliant than anyone else), some things we thought were coincidental were not in fact. This detracts a bit from the original, especially since we know it was written without knowledge that there will be another book in the future, with Bean playing such a prominent role. Nevertheless, it is still superb as a complimentary reading for Ender's game. I am certain I will not forget Bean's story for a long time.	2001-08-17

A few weeks ago I finished my first Discworld novel, 'Mort', which was a very light and funny book. Therefore, I assumed all Discworld novels would be like this.. I guess I was wrong. Small Gods is funny (at least in the beginning) - but far, far from being a light book, which is not necessarily a bad thing. <br /> Small Gods tells about Brutha, a not so smart lad who one day hears the voice of his great god Om calling him. But contrary to what he expected, the great god Om wasn't really such a great god - in fact, he was quite small.. like a turtle. And he didn't have any powers at all. And apparently, not many believers either. The book tells about the god Om and Brutha's adventures, trying to survive in Omnia (which is a very religious in a fanatic way...) - and maybe even restore the god to his full power. <BR> The book really started light, but turned into a very heavy and philosophical novel about the nature of religions and gods - and of people and belief. Really, I think it would've fit quite well into a philosophy class. Typically to Terry Pratchett, the book is very very witty - I don't think the man knows how to write in an 'Unwitty' way. I don't think I laughed at all during the second half of the book, but I still couldn't stop reading it - and definitely enjoyed the read. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Discworld, and enjoys reading books which make you think afterwards. However, don't get it if you want a book which will just make you laugh.	2001-07-29

The book continues where the previous book left: Emma Merrigan's mother, Eleanor, is trapped in the wasteland and as a result, her real body is in a coma. Emma, along with the mysterious rogue - Blaise Raponde, tries to further explore the wasteland and rescue her mother from the curses. What complicates matters, is that one of the rogues she encounters takes on a body in her close vicinity - a girlfriend of her good friend Matt. <br /> Sounds kind of messy? It definitely is. <BR>I think the author really wanted to get this book done with. The first two thirds of the book should've been compacted to 50 pages; almost nothing happens, and it just feels like an attempt in filling pages. The rest of the book is not bad, but way too rushed, and more than that - a few things in the book don't really feel complete, which makes me feel cheated because most of the book was so slow - other parts just don't make sense. I guess it will be continued in another sequel..  <BR> If you liked the previous book, you can read this one - but don't expect too much: despite it being an okay book, I can't say I wasn't disappointed - I really expected more!	2001-07-22

But first - &quot;Mort&quot; tells about Mort, a young boy living in the Discworld who is looking for an apprentice position. Fortunately (or not), Death - yes, the grim reaper - is looking for an apprentice and Mort seems like a very good candidate. Mort takes on the offer and starts a rather bizarre existence.. especially since he falls in love with one of his &quot;Clients&quot; and refuses to let her die, thus, challenging the destiny and gods of the Discworld. <BR> As a stranger to discworld I was a bit afraid that I will not understand many of the puns and ideas of this book, but it is *completely* self contained. I did feel there were some references that I wasn't familiar with, but nothing which ruined the fun in the least. Very highly recommended, reading it was a nonstop pleasure.	2001-07-08

The book tells the story of Jesse Dailey and Eric Twilegar, 2 self proclaimed Geeks. Eric and Jesse are two teenagers who lived in Idaho in a place which is really as remote as it gets in the US. They did not fit in their school's society, and their only joy was a &quot;Geek club&quot; which was started by a teacher of theirs - and the internet. The author, Jon Katz, was very intriguied with Jesse and Eric after an email correspondence, so he flew to Idaho to meet and interview them. This started a chain of events which led Eric and Jesse to leave Idaho for a search of a better life. The book tells their story. <BR> But that's not all. The book is more than that, it also contains &quot;essays&quot; (I have no other word to describe these) about geekness in general, why there are outcasts in high schools and other interesting related issues. <BR> To summarize: I loved the book! Reading what Eric and Jesse had gone through really made me feel close to them, and the way they grew and matured was truly heartwarming. The geek essays were also very interesting, and gave me a lot food for thought. But more than that, the story of these 2 smart teenagers really is a tale of the internet age - how anybody who is smart, brave and good with computers can make a better life for himself these days. I certainly see a lot of the book in my personal life. <BR><br />I recommend the book to geeks and non geeks alike, and I wish Eric and Jesse luck everywhere they go to.	2001-06-22

I read some of the other reviews, and it seems I'm in aminority view - for I really really didn't like this book.  The bookstarts in a very 'standard' way: Mathew Mantrell, a graduate student,finds an ancient text. He somehow manages to read it (not knowinghow), and finds himself transported into a fantasy world, where magicand fantasy creatures exist.  So far, a simple use of a A very populartheme. I even reviewed another book which starts in a similar same way(top dog). When Matt find himself in the unknown land, he for someunknown reason, starts to say rhymes out loud (we don't know why),only to discover that in this realm, his rhymes have strange powers -magical powers, and since he's such a strong rhymer - well, he's avery powerful wizard. Soon enough he is 'drafted' to help a princessin distress reclaim her kingdom from an evil sorcerer.<BR> So far sogood - really a great premise. However, the book is a TOTAL cliche -everything is expected, there really is no explanation why the maincharacter acts in certain ways, he always casts spells when somethingbad happens - but the idea of actually using magic in advance to solveproblems never occurs into him. Thus, the story becomes reallyunbelievable.  A good example: at the beginning of the book, Matt useshis powers to transport his companions out of a dungeon. Then hediscovers he has to cross an entire land to get to a certainplace. Not even once he thinks 'Hey, I can teleport myself.. so whynot try and port us again?'. I guess if he did that, then there wouldbe no story.. but this kind of stuff really makes the story feelamateurish, if not even .... <br /> But the thing which really turned meoff about this book was its inheret seriousness. At first I thoughtit's a really light read. But I was wrong.  The book is not light atall. Apparently, in the book's fantasy world, medieval moralityactually &quot;works&quot;, i.e., if the main character lusts aboutsomeone, he is a sinner, and if he goes to church, he is forgiven -it's not just theology there.  ....  Every short tale in this book hadits underlying religious aspect, which was very transparent, andcompletely ruined whatever shred of fun I had from this book.	2001-03-31

Other times, I just want a light and fun book.  Cat-A-Lyst started as one of the lighest novels I have ever read:  an actor, Jason Carter, goes on a trip to Peru in search of hidden Inca treasure. While there, he encounters interesting characters and strange situations (funny aliens, An Inca colony on another planet which is determined to avenge the demise of their empire done by the Spanish centuries ago, and more). I read two thirds of the book and really had lots of fun - this was exactly what I wanted at the time, very very fun plot - even if it wasn't really a believable one. But then the book became *really* ridiculous.. so I forced myself to finish it just to know how the story ends. <BR> Overall, I think this book would be perfect for times of real boredom (such as a long flight).. but don't get it expecting a masterpiece, because this is nearly the exact opposite.	2001-03-26

In the book's setting, people  can travel through time easily and with very few problems. More than that, they can travel to MUs - Moment Universes, which are like instances of our universe at a given point in time. That means they can travel through a certain point in time and behave in some way, and afterwards go to the *same* moment, only on a different universe, and act differently. (Imagine, killing Brutus when he tries to murder Ceasar on one universe, and helping Brutus on another). <BR> The book's protagonist is Dr. Owen Vannice, a paleontologist who gets entangled with 2 con artists who trick people in different time periods. <BR> This too sounds good, no? <BR> So what is bad? <BR> Well, The story is utterly *filled* with logic inconsistencies. The author contradicts himself left and right.. and the most annoying thing, is that the author simply avoids certain &quot;problems&quot; with his theories.. he doesn't even bother finding silly solutions for them... simply ignores them altogher. You must agree that a book about time travel which doesn't raise the issue of travelling to the future is kind of silly. And what about meeting with yourself? Or maybe even having time travellers from the future coming to visit YOU? All these are ignored.<BR> In addition, the story doesn't focus on these ideas.. it concentrates on a silly love affair of the main characters...  That, and the fact that I couldn't stand any of the characters made it a BAD book. <br /> Another wasted idea in the book: the kidnapping of historical figures and bringing them to the present. This can lead to to interesting ideas - but what does the author do with it? Mozart becomes a pop star, Jesus starts a talk show, Abraham Lincoln becomes a PR representative.. It's as if these historical figures just *wanted* to drop everything, leave their families, and come to the future to do silly tasks. Utterly ridiculous. <BR> If you really like the premise, read Joshua Dann's Timeshare trilogy... wasn't a masterpiece, but certainly much better than this. Otherwise, avoid this book.	2001-02-25

I've read the other two books of Jerry Jay Carroll (&quot;Top Dog&quot;, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;), which were far superior. It's not a bad book, really, but if you've read Heinlein's &quot;The puppet masters&quot;, or seen the movie &quot;The Arrival&quot;, this book will really be a waste of time. It's quite well written and witty as well, but come on - it feels as if I have already read this book - and more than once! It's almost a copy of the mentioned works.. The story? Aliens try to conquer Earth by possessing humans, and our hero, the private investigator Goodwin Armstrong is the only person who is able to stop them. If it sounds familiar, then you're not imagining things.. if it doesn't, then this will be a reasonably amusing book.	2001-01-28
US	49942614	R2QZVZSPTA023U	0312867131	77230724	Calculating God	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Science fiction at its best!	A while ago I read another book by Robert J. Sawyer, &quot;Flashforward&quot;. Despite the fact I liked that book, I can't believe the same author wrote book, because &quot;Calculating God&quot; is considerably superior. It is written in a very clear and funny way, yet still is a very, very serious book. <BR> The permise of the book, in my humble opinion, is probably one of the best I have ever read. Imagine this: An alien spacecraft lands near the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada (the time setting for the book is the present). A spider-like creature comes out of the craft, walks into the lobby, and in perfect English asks the guard for the location of the nearest Paleontologist. The shocked guard directs the creature to a paleontologist, and an interesting conversation starts between the two. Apparently, in both the alien's world, our world, and another alien world, there were 5 great extinctions (the last 1 occured 65 Million years ago, and is the most famous one here). The interesting fact, is that all occured exactly at the same time. Our protagonist, the paleontologist asks, But how can this be? All these worlds are very distant. So the alien replies, it could only have happened because that is the will of God. The paleontologist seemed taken aback by such religious opinions, so the alien says - but how can you not believe in god, for his existence is a scientific fact. According to the alien, the purpose of all modern science is to discover god's reasoning, and his methods of operation. <BR> That's the premise. It all happens in the 1st chapter, so I don't think I spoiled anything. This is superb hard core science fiction, filled with scientific theories. I must say, I have never heard a more convincing argument for god's existence than the book's. The first 150 pages are literally among the best I have ever read. Then the book starts to lose focus, fills with rambling thoughts of the main character, and I really didn't like the ending. Nevertheless, the first half is SO good, that the book still gets 5 stars from me.	2001-01-21

Books	3	1	1	N	N	Very Cute - but Extremely Predictable	&quot;O Pioneer&quot; tells the story of Evesham Giyt, a futuristic hacker, who decides to immigrate to the new frontier, a newly inhabited planet named Tupelo. One thing Evesham wasn't aware of when he came to the planet - it is NOT empty. The planet is already inhabited by 5 other sentient races, each with its own characteristics. In addition, it seems there is some kind of a conspiracy going on the planet, and there's no one able to stop it - except Evesham!<BR> This is a real cute book. Very relaxing and enjoying. The aliens are really a delight to read about, so diverse - yet very consistent. But the bad thing about the story - it's very predictable from first to last page - there's no catch or anything. And the story gets a bit slow at times - which is annoying, since the book is very short anyway (~250 pages). Nevertheless, it's still worth a read to any sci-fi fan, if only for the aliens. One last comment, I am a Star Trek fan, and I'm really getting tired that all aliens there are nearly identical in appearance and behavior.. this book shows there are more possibilities to this often underexplored genre.	2001-01-16

US	49942614	R2IHRWVE9YU3W5	1565926919	774738062	Building Oracle XML Applications	Books	5	9	9	N	N	I wish all programming books were like this one!!!	First, I must say, when I picked this book a few weeks ago, I already was working with XML/Oracle/Etc for almost a year. At the time the variety of books in the market was very limited (I had to learn XSLT from a site in the Czecz republic because no book offered a decent coverage!). So, I picked this book to see what I had missed, and what I was doing perhaps not in the best way. This book was everything that I expected and more. It covers *a lot* of material, XML, XML Storage (How to use Oracle Clobs, for example), XPATH, XSLT and more - the authors don't cut corners, they explain everything thoroughly, and that's why the book takes more than 700 pages. The examples are excellent - concise and right to the point. The material is written in a clear and comprehensive way. Usually programming books take a lot out of me - but not this one!  I thought I knew a lot about XML, but I learned much I didn't know from this book. To summarize, this is how a programming book should be! Simply above and beyond the call of duty. I also think it would be useful for people which intend to use XML with databases other than Oracle.	2001-01-08

I haven't read the previous version whom many of the other  reviewers said was outdated, but this book seems very up to date, and discusses the new network capabilities of Java 1.3. To sum it up, I think this book provides an excellent introduction to Java network programming, and will be good to anyone who needs to learn this information.	2001-01-08
US	49942614	RNV8TX7REU83X	0061057983	514473042	Diaspora	Books	4	41	45	N	N	Ingenious but...	First, let me tell you this: Greg Egan is a genius. His ideas are unparalleled by any other science fiction writer I know of. I have read several of his books, and his novels/short stories are the most unique stories I have ever read. Having said that, I have to say he has a bit of a problem with writing long novels and tends to lose focus and drift away. He shines with short stories, though. This book has the same problems. It actually seems like 2 books, really, the first and the second part are so different. The first half of the books tells the story of Yatima, an artificial intelligence being who lives inside a &quot;polis&quot;, which is the equivalent of a city of AIs. The story details how Yatima was &quot;born&quot;, how did he evolve, and elaborates on his experiences. The background of the story is complex and detailed - yet still remains believable: most of what is left of humanity chose to turn themselves to digital beings, others turned themselves to Gleisners (Robots). But a few chose to remain human, albeit genetically modified humans. This part is *awesome*, *amazing* - it is very, very good! Then, roughly in the middle of the book the story takes a turn: after an unexplained phenomena which occured and wiped the remaining human population, one of the polises decides to go on a &quot;Diaspora&quot;, clone itself and explore the galaxy. This part elaborates on the journey. The thing is, there is very very little story, most of it is complicated scientific theories. I'm sure Greg Egan knows his science, from what I understood (I couldn't follow everything), he got it right to the point. But it gets way too complicated. Seriously, I had university courses easier than this part of the book! And it is not really necessary, most of the time, a theory is introduced, and then the story moves on to the next theory. In the meanwhile, there isn't much left of the original story - the scientific background seems to be much more important than the plot! I wouldgive 5 (or more!) stars to the first half of the book, and 2 to the second part. But overall, the second part really ruined a lot of the book for me. Nonetheless, I'd still recommend it - just be prepared for a very high level of physics! And check out &quot;Axiomatic&quot;, this is truly one of the best short science fiction stories of all time - Greg Egan at his best.	2000-12-21

Nevertheless, it is still not as good as its predecessor. In the story Bogey Ingersol is back in our world, having being completely changed by his experiences in 'Top Dog'. But a strange series of events leads him to think that his nemesis from the other world, the evil wizard Zalzathar, might have chased him to this world - So  Bogey must find a way to fight back! Like the previous book, this novel is witty and original. It is very fun to read, and filled with memorable characters. Overall, a really good book. My only complaint is that the ending of the book seems terribly rushed.. what was written in 5 pages should've taken at least 2 chapters. Last, one of the reviews below (I won't say which) has a VERY big spoiler in my opinion, which really ruined part of the fun and surprise of the book for me, so be careful when you read them.	2000-12-08

First, it's not written in a very clear way, I simply didn't understand everything in the book. However, the biggest reason not to buy this book, YOU HAVE TO READ ALL/MOST OF THE CHAPTERS TO UNDERSTAND PARTS. Why is that bad? Many people, including me, like to read only relevant chapters. For example, if you already know some of the stuff, you skip directly to the right chapter and read from there. You can't really do it here, since the authors create lots of classes they constantly use in later chapters. Thus, it makes the book terribly inconvenient. Maybe this is only my impression, I didn't read all of the book, but after a few chapters that I found myself reading stuff I *DIDN'T WANT TO READ*, I just abandoned this book and moved to another one.	2000-12-08

Imagine, everybody in the world &quot;living&quot; for 2 minutes their lives 20 years from now. This can have a huge effect on people, as can be expected. This is the premise of this book! I think it is overall a good book, however, it is not written in an &quot;exciting&quot; way, I didn't find myself eager to continue every day, and it's sad, because the premise is just *so* good. Also, the author seems to focus on the technology of this occurence, which is kind of silly, since he's &quot;inventing&quot; a future technology and really expanding on it.. this really isn't very interesting, and too much time is being spent on it. Other than that, I guess it's worth it after all, although it should be a priority reading if you know what I mean..	2000-11-27

Well, this is one of these books - with a twist. The twist? Our hero, Bill Ingersol isn't an average person - he's a wall street shark - who's still not sure whether to go with the good guys or the bad guys. And he's also been turned to a dog - no human can understand what he's trying to say. This sounds intriguing, I'm certain - and indeed, the book delivers what's promised! The writing is witty and original, the hero is certainly not the classic hero type, and the book ends before you realize it, it's that good! Now I'm sorry I haven't bought the second book already.. have to wait till I get it! So - go get &quot;Top Dog&quot;, you're going to love it!	2000-11-17

Now, after reading most of the book I can definitely say I know the subject. The author patiently explains us the basics - yet also goes into the deeper aspects of EJB. The book is filled with examples, which makes learning so much easier (don't you hate it when there are very few examples, or there is no sample output??). I must say, EJB is a pretty boring subject - but the book did a good job of keeping me awake! One comment I do have, is that the book doesn't explain very well how to deploy beans.. I still have problems with my weblogic server. But I guess that's not the point of the book, so it still deserves 5 stars.	2000-11-11

But bumping into an abused teenager, and inviting her to stay with her draws her into a strange world, where curses exist, and time travel (sort off) is possible. This book is not really a time travel novel (as I thought when I bought it), it's more of a fantasy book. But I never read any other book like it. Lynn Abbey, the author, creates a believable fantasy world. It reminded me a bit of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere - a fantasy world superimposed on our modern reality. I really loved the book - and am eagerly looking for a sequel.	2000-10-27

It's really a very sweet and sentimental book. Mr. Shatner tells the readers about the history of Star Trek, Star Trek fans, Star Trek conventions (what happens there?), Star Trek anecdotes and more. He also tells some stories about himself. But more than everything else in the book, he tries to analyze what makes Star Trek such a huge success, and why some fans love this series so much that they are acting crazy (for example, he tells about a guy who likes to come to Star Trek conventions with his cats. The punch line? the cats are dressed in Starfleet uniforms!!). Mr. Shatner also interviews several cast members, asking for their take on the Star Trek phenomena. (Jeri Ryan, Leonard Nimoy, and more) As a big Star Trek fan I must say I really loved this book. William Shatner is actually a talented writer, and the book is very fun to read! However, I felt as if there was too little material.. I had hoped for more personal anecdotes from Mr. Shatner's experience. Either way, this is a book no trekkie should miss, and even people who aren't very big Star Trek fans will probably like it. One last thing - I think everybody who has liked this book should also look at the &quot;semi&quot; documentary film &quot;Trekkies&quot; which is wonderful, and reminded me a lot of this book.	2000-09-20

If they bore  me after 80-100 pages, I stop reading the book, often never returning to  it.. Ever since I've started reviewing books in Amazon, I've made a  conscious decision to try and finish all the books I've started reading.  But here I failed!  The book has such an interesting premise.. The solar  system, inhabited by many different races. Humans trying to obtain a  &quot;deepdrive&quot; which all the other aliens have. And it is an  interesting premise! However, the story just doesn't make any sense at  times. I found that I couldn't understand what was going on. Why did this  character do that? What happened right now? What do the aliens want? What  is going on here?? I agree that the aliens were very interesting.. but  there just wasn't enough to grab my attention. and I did try.. I suffered  through 150 pages (1/2 the book). One last thing, the book is called  &quot;Deepdrive&quot;, and according to the book reviews it's about getting  a &quot;deepdrive&quot;, the one thing humans don't have. As I mentioned -  I'm halfway through the book, and there is still no explanation that  &quot;getting the deepdrive is the purpose of the book&quot;. Or what is a  deepdrive, etc. I guess the author assumed we'd all read the book reviews  to find out the background to the story.. To summarize, I gave it 2 stars  mainly because it does have some interesting ideas.. but the rest is just  plain bad.	2000-09-05

In short, it tells the story of  Gabriel, an Aristoi, something like a &quot;modern god&quot;,(ordinary  people, yet who control a planet with future technology). The book's  greatness is in the amount of great ideas it has.. every one of those could  be a basis for a book on its own. I know some people didn't like this  book... but I loved it!

As a java software developer, who works a lot with servlets, I found this  book very useful. But it really isn't targetted towards novice programmers.  You need to already have some background about servlets. I found the book  especially useful in teaching some of the more advanced servlet programming  issues. As well as the chapter which dealt with applet-servlet  communication. (There is a basic chat system sample in chapter 10 which is  written using applets and servlets. I learned a lot from looking at that  sample, and I also learned a lot from the problems in it..) Overal, it's a  good book, but you have to concentrate when reading the book, and  sometimes, even read the chapter more than once.	2000-08-30

First, before I begin, I must say that Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. He is a science fiction grandmaster, and deserves the honor. He  wrote excellent works such as Starship Troopers, The puppet masters, and my  personal favorite: Jobe, a comedy of justice. However, this book is simply  bad!  The first story, Gulf, tells about a person (a spy) who discovers he  is a part of an advance subrace of human. The story has some interesting  ideas, and is actually quite good. The second story, Elsewhen, tells about  a group of people that can travel between various realities. It has  interesting ideas, however it is written *SO* badly, *SO* badly, the level  of writing is like a 7th grader. The characters aren't even two  dimensional... Maybe one dimensional, barely. The third story, Legacy,  tells about a scientists which try to develop uncharted parts of the brain,  because they believe it holds the key to superhuman abilities. Again, this  is horribly written, after reading half the story I realized I feel as if  I'm watching &quot;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&quot;. It was just so  similar. I couldn't finish the story, it was that stupid. The fourth and  last story, Jerry was a man, tells about a future where it's possible to  create (almost) any kind of creature, with genetic engineering. I liked  this story, it had good ideas, and was short - and good. Overall, I think  this book is not worth it. I saw that all of these stories were written in  the 40s-50s, so they might actually be some of Heinlein's earliest work..  maybe that's why he doesn't shine in them. If you're really a fan, you can  get this book, but as a collection of stories it's simply bad. The 2 good  stories just aren't worth buying the entire book.  One last thing, if you  never read any other Heinlein book - go get one! He is one of the finest  science fiction writers, and one lousy book can't change that.	2000-08-16

First, I must say, this book has *A LOT* of material. It  covers much more subjects than any other java book I saw. However, it's not  very clear. and it uses &quot;too many words&quot;, so to speak. For  example, there is a chapter comparing some strange nuances that C++ and  Java differ in... Who cares?? I spent so much time reading these things, it  was difficult to tell what is important, and what isn't. Also, there are no  code sample runs, which makes the examples difficult to understand. Last,  for every small thing the author uses 2-3+ pages of examples, which makes  understanding cumbersome, sometimes 1 page would be enough. However, it's  still worth buying, because of the depth. When I just started learning  Java, I bought another Java book which had considerably less material than  this book, and read it, and if I needed more information, I would just read  the appropriate chapter in &quot;Thinking in Java&quot;.<br />To sum it up, in  my opinion, worth buying, but not as the only book. Good as the 2nd java  book.	2000-08-04

This book was very easy to read, good examples, well written.  However, SO MUCH was not covered. Even basic things! (If I'm not mistaken,  even things such as Collections were not covered! As far as I can  remember..) Every time I needed to master quickly a subject, I read the  appropriate chapter from this book, and if I needed more information, I'd  just glance at &quot;Thinking in Java&quot; which contains much, much more  information. The problem exists in the subjects which aren't covered...

It tells the story of a woman, who inherits her great grandmother's appartment, and finds out there is a door in there which leads 72 years into the past. Contrary to  other time travel books, the travel itself isn't what the book focuses on -  the &quot;technical&quot; aspects of time travel. Neither does it focus on  historial facts (like other time travel books). Instead, it focuses on some  historical figures, such as the famous Aleister Crowley, and on magick  (&quot;real&quot; magic). Overall, this is a fantasy novel, with a lot of  romance in it, but written in a very unique manner. I simply could not put  it down!  I recommend it to anyone who has an interest (or at least, isn't  upset) by reading about magical rituals, likes time travel books - and has  a romantic heart ;-)	2000-08-01

On one hand, I think the book is very good. Creative, superbly written, realistic characters. However, I really didn't like the end. I'd say this book is a part of  sub-genre inside the &quot;Time travel&quot; genre. I'm a time travel  fanatic, I read any time-travel book I could get my hands on, And I've  noticed that many of these books tend to concentrate on historic facts, as  if to make the story &quot;come alive&quot;. Well, &quot;Time on my  hands&quot; is definitely the best. (MUCH MUCH better than Joshua Dann's  series). The story has some unusual twists. But again, the ending somewhat  ruined the book for me. It seemed to be a homage to H.G. Wells' classic  story, &quot;The time machine&quot;, which also had a bad ending in my  opinion...pity. I just hope the author will live up to his promise, and  write a sequel. And if that happens, I guess this review should be upgraded  to 5 stars :)	2000-07-04

This is one of these stories. This is the story of a memory-less hero, who embarks on a  quest to find his memory.  The tale of his exploits is not an ordinary  adventure tale: his adventures are poetic - philosophical. This a story  which really makes the reader think. I know I did not fully comprehend all  of it. Yet it is worth the read. This book will be great to anyone who  loves philosophical fantasy novels - or loves the planescape setting.	2000-05-29

Actually, I'd say, most of Greg Egan's books are for you. This is a collection of short stories, unlike any I have ever read (and I love  reading these collections! ). Almost every single one of them is  extraordinary. At times I had to slow down, and try to grasp what he means  in order to continue, but once I got it, it just made the story more  enjoyable. If you're a hard core sci-fi reader - buy this book! You won't  regret this desicion. :)	2000-05-13

I got the impression it's going to be one of the best books I'm ever going to read. (Did it win a Hugo? I'm not sure, but it might have had). The world David Brin created was fascinating, but the story was just SO BORING... I kept  waiting for something exciting to happen - but nothing! I managed to finish  the book, only to decide I'm never going to read the sequals. Although many  reviewers said that this is the weakest book in the series, so maybe I  should give him a second chance. His short stories book was superb, in my  opinion.  Anyway, to summarize - so-so, in my opinion. If you heard good  things about the next books - I guess this should be worth reading. but if  you have a list of good books, and you're just trying to decide which one  to read? Wait with this one	2000-05-13
US	49942614	RRWANW0EH695S	0451457366	887615419	The Engines of Dawn	Books	4	23	26	N	N	Fun read!	This is what people might call &quot;a light novel&quot;. It's not too deep, but it has a very engaging story. At times, I found I couldn't stop reading despite late hour and lack of sleep :) It has some interesting  ideas, and it's written to the point with not too much long and boring  background. As for the bad reviews it got? I can't argue with them, the  book has its bad points (again - not too deep, very thin character  development), but if you don't expect to read a masterpiece, and are just  looking for a few hours of enjoyable reading, this book should be very  satisfying!	2000-05-13

This book taught me so much! It's filled with technical data - yet very easy to understand! It has many short chapters, so it's actually possible just to learn very specific stuff by reading some chapters. It's simply the  best way to start with networks.	2000-05-03

It had some funny parts which were worthy of reading, despite the annoying parts. What do I mean when I say &quot;annoying parts&quot; ? stuff like &quot;As for my computer skills,  you know there hasn't bee anyone that ineffective at a keyboard since Susan  Dey was in The Partridge Family.&quot;. I'm not sure who Susan Dey is, and  I barely remember the Partridge Family. The point is, I think one of every  3-4 funny &quot;bits&quot; of the book refers to a name, or a show, or  something. Nevermind that I don't know 80% of these names - it just stops  being funny after the 3rd or 4th times. Anyway, Like I said before, it's  funny despite the annoying parts.	2000-05-02

Very easy to understand, yet still manages to reach depth of subject AND in MANY areas of Linux - definitely the best way to start Linux Programming!	2000-04-15

If you don't know much about Java Servlets, this should be a very good way to start with - but if you're looking for a book with more  info, this one isn't suitable.  By the way, there were many strange  inaccurate facts in the book. (i.e., the author says &quot;Many people  believes cookies can be a risk to user's privacy, which is obviously not  true&quot;. I took an entire course about these things - Has the author  EVER heard of DoubleClick? .  Also, where did the author get the idea that  Microsoft Access comes with Windows.. you have to buy it separately)	2000-04-15

But he seems to write mostly for the money (he even admits this fact, as far as I can remember). The result is, many of his books have very interesting ideas, yet poor (sometimes even  pathetic) character development and a story line which doesn't make sense  at time. Not to mention the chapters added only to &quot;fill the  quota&quot;. This book is a good example. It tells the tale of the  reincarnation of Time - a person which got the job of being in charge of  time. The ideas he uses are really original and fascinating - but some  parts are just plain stupid! Either way, it's worth the read - if you have  the patience (and nothing better to read).	2000-04-15
US	49942614	R3HKWNDPLRVQB2	068816112X	761772754	Replay	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A must!	One of the greatest books I ever read - great story, great characters, thought provoking. The story of a man who returns 25 years to the past.. lives his life as he always wished he could (with future knowledge). And  then finds himself back in the past, where he started. So he lives his  life, again. After 25 years he returns once more to the past. and once  more. and more... What can a person do when he lived his life - so many  different ways?  <br />This book is simply perfect! I wish Ken Grimwood wrote  more stories... One can only hope .. (Although &quot;Into the deep&quot; is  also good, but not even close to the quality of this book)	2000-04-15

One one  hand, it is well written, and very clear to understand. But on the other hand, it contains *very* little information, almost everything I needed I had to find on the net, or  search the man pages. It claims &quot;not to be a reference&quot;. Then why  buy it at all!  I'd rather buy a book which teaches the material *and*  contains all the information I need.	2000-04-15
