Throughout this autobiography Marya gives strong detail about the drugs, drinking, and hospitalization periods she went through while going through the struggles and fighting with her parents.  Marya never went to a public high school, but she attended a boarding school, also known as \\"the hotbed,\\" for people with eating disorders.  But for Marya, it did not start there.  When Marya was only nine years old she thought of herself as worthless and fat.  That's when bulimia beacame a dark reality in her life, and it was just the beginning of the end.<BR>I recommend this book to people struggling with the need to know the reality of the path they may someday choose to walk.  This is a great book, and Marya has a meaningful story that people should be aware of.	2003-03-17

This book describes the lives of our countries aeronautical pioneers,<BR>Wilbur and Orville Wright,and how they invented the first true airplane. From the time they were children, Wilbur and Orville lived together, played together, worked together ,and even thought together. From their tiny bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. to the Kitty Hawk Island sand dunes. These two men defied known ideas about flight and built their own self-propelled craft that soared them to fame. Even today, a little over a hundred years after their first self-propelled manned flight, these two men are remembered for their courage. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in either the Wright Brothers or the history of flight in general. If it were not for these two, man would not have gotten of the ground!	2003-03-17

This book was great.  It doesn't just tell about her adult life; it also talks about how she got started, like when she was young.  She was always the tomboy type until she was in her twenties.  As she got older, she had to be the center of all the attention.  To tell you the truth, she was always full of herself, which wasn't always a good thing.  Babe participated in almost every sport that a woman could do.  She was good at every one of them, too.  She turned professional in track and field, basketball, and golf. I recommend this book to any girl who loves to compete in sports. I really didn't have a role model until I read this book!	2003-03-17

I liked it because it gave more information about Einstein's personality and went into less detail about the science that made him famous.  His theories and figures are explained well but kept simple enough so anyone could understand them.  The book's not very exciting, but it keeps you coming back to it after every chapter.  The book covers many interesting facts of physics and laws of nature that Albert's curiosity and desire to learn brought this knowledge to the world.  I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in Einstein, his discoveries, or the laws of nature.	2003-03-17

I liked this book because the main character, Mary Crow Dog, stands up for what she believes in.  She is also a strong-willed Native American woman.  She and her husband, Lenard Crow Dog, were great leaders in the American Indian Movement(AIM).  I enjoyed reading this book because Mary Crow Dog stands strong through the many difficult situations she had to go through.  One part I liked in the book was when AIM protested outside of a police station, and the police got scared, so AIM got what they wanted.  People who like to stand up for themselves or admire people like that will enjoy this book.  I encuorage anyone who is looking for a great biography or autobiography to read this book.

This book was very informative and meticulous.  I liked this book because it had many fascinating facts about the horrific life Hitler went through.  Most people think he was only involved in the Holocaust but as I read, I learned that he affected so much in history other than that.  Before the Holocaust even started, he was infamous in Germany.  I would definitely recommend this book for people who love learning about history around the world or for the people who are interested in reading about Hitler and what he did to change history.	2003-03-17

Throughout this autobiography Marya gives strong detail about the drugs, drinking, and hospitalization periods she went through while going through the struggles and fighting with her parents.  Marya never went to a public high school, but she attended a boarding school, also known as \\"the hotbed,\\" for people with eating disorders.  But for Marya, it did not start there.  When Marya was only nine years old she thought of herself as worthless and fat.  That's when bulimia beacame a dark reality in her life, and it was just the beginning of the end.<BR>I recommend this book to people struggling with the need to know the reality of the path they may someday choose to walk.  This is a great book, and Marya has a meaningful story that people should be aware of.	2003-03-17

The thing that kept me reading was that I am a skateboarder, too!  The character is a boy called Tony Hawk.  The book talks about Tony from the time he started to skateboard, to when he was a professional skateboarder.  As I read the book, I was always wondering what would happen next, which made me want to continue reading more to see.<br />    I easily noticed that it was full of action and entertainment.  I recommend all you skateboard fans read this book and have an adventure with Tony Hawk.	2003-03-17

James Herriot's All Creatures Great and Small is the greatest book about being a veterinary assistant.  Herriot begins his story when he is fresh out of vetranary school.  Anyone who loves animals and is thinking of maybe becoming a vet would love this book,too.  There may be a lot of pages to read, but this book keeps you guessing what will happen to him next.  I would love to recommend this book even to people who love adventure stories.  In this book you may be able to relate to a lot of problems that Herriot has.  Some of his problems are easy and some are hard.  For example sometimes he comes in late about midnight then gets a call to deliver a calf at 2 a.m. in subzero temperatures.  I hope you take my advice and read this wonderful book.	2003-03-17
