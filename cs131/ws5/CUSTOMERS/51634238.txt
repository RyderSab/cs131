The only drawback was that I had nothing to read on the way back. I thought I would be taking breaks in between but I just had to keep reading. Great realistic action and mystery. Overall just great descriptive writing. I'll be getting more books from Chris Ryan!	2004-08-24

I bought it anyhow. And I was wrong. It does go on little tangents sometimes but it doesn't detract from the book. It covers the major aspects of improvements and wars that attributed to the advancement of the british navy. I suppose going into too much detail would make the book over a 1000 pages long. At 450 pages the book gives a pretty good overall glimpse of the passing of time and the movements of the naval command. Great read.	2004-07-09

I was told that this is the book to read when you want to begin understanding the goings on in the market. And he was right. The book gets better as it goes on. Very interesting and very relevant to today's market. You will learn some things reading the chapters, its worthwhile.	2004-03-01

I learned more about Jades and Burma than about accounting. The theories that it did touch on was only covered very loosely.<br /> Not to mention the editing, character and basic writing mistakes. The story was pretty amateurish as well unfortunately.	2003-10-11

I've heard so many great things about Numbered Account that I wanted to read his latest book because the premise sounded interesting. While he did delve into financial crimes details which I enjoy, the story line was just not beleiveable. It just felt like something was missing. It was all too pat, the characters were cardboard.<br /> I am planning on reading Numbered Account and I am hoping that it will be better.<br /><br /> But on the plus side, I'll still keep an eye out for what he will be writing next as I like financial thrillers.	2003-10-03

I'm hoping that Paul Erdman is in the process of writing more books. The book moves quickly, though in the beginning it gets into some financial descriptions that might put off some readers. If you are reading a financial thriller I think you should expect that kind of thing, and I think going into financial theory is an interesting part of the book.	2003-08-18

And after reading most of the other books (not in order), I just finished reading Crisis Four after Liberation Day, I have to say that if you really enjoyed the other books you'll probably still like this one.<br /> On that point, I do have to agree that it seemed to get a little tired. Like Andy wasn't trying that hard to make a good story. All the usual tradecraft descriptions were there, but the plot wasn't. The book is okay, but compared to some of his other books, it wasn't totally up to scratch.<br /><br /> But if you've only read this book then you should probably pick up one of the other books to get a better idea what the series is like. Though if you don't like a litany of tradecraft descriptions then you'd probably not like the others as well. But to me that is all part of the charm of the series. It adds to realism.<br /> Better luck next time.	2003-06-27

Let's just say that based on the strength of this book I immediately went out and bought Remote Control, his first non-fiction book. And seeing how that's going so far I'll be buying more.<br /> I had finished reading Firewall in a few days. It was that good. Great detail on how Intell operations work, tactics, strategies. fantastic for realism.<br /> Other books of this nature that I found great were 'Dogs of War' and of course, 'The Day of the Jackal'. Both excellent books for Forsyth.<br /> I should have started to read McNabs books years ago. I had falsely assumed that the books would be all bravado a la Rambo-style but its not like that at all.<br /> Constant action, realism, and just an all around great read. What you also discover is that McNab is also a really good writer for someone of his background.<br /> Keep up the great work Andy. I'm looking forward for your latest book.	2003-04-29

In the beginning I thought it wasn't so bad, but then it really got deplorable. I really really wanted to like the book. It started off well, and the premise and story was original. As was, the style. But in the end it fell flat and I rushed myself just to finish the book (I skipped and skimmed pages). It felt rushed.<br /> The idea of North Korea was intriguing considering the current situation, and there was a some good elements to the book.<br /> In the end, I think the writer has potential. But obviously going from journalism to fiction writing is not a simple step.<br /> And a real need for a real editor would help.	2003-02-07

It is very detailed on the 'how to' of building a mercenary operation amongst other things (banking and setting up front companies), which I really enjoyed.<br /> It seemed to be almost a manual for the mercenary soldier. In fact, if you are thinking of becoming one you should probably read this book.<br /><br /> Don't get me wrong here either. There was a very good story, and with a surprising end (and surprising middles too).<br /><br /> Very well written. Anyone know of other books detailed like this?	2003-02-07

I just finished reading this book, and I am very much planning to read more of David's novels (as this was the first one I've read).<br /> From beginning to end nothing can be assumed in this book. It gave a very realistic feel to the spy game and to middle east politics. Though it takes places years ago the story could have taken place today. It's sad to see how little has changed in this area of the world.<br /> Agents of Innocence gives the reader a inside look at the geopolitics of the middle east and how the CIA, Mossad, Fatah and other groups operate and interoperate. Very good morale tale, and ending. I just loved it. Thanks David for a great book and some very fine writing and for my friends who gave it to me as a christmas present.<br /> How well you know I'd love this book.	2003-01-22

The author goes into details of operations used to capture, and at times not capture various transnational organized gangs. On the flip side he also describes how the gangs operate to circumvent the law, including names of major players and which cities they are located in.<br /> Ironically when I finished reading one of the chapters on Russian Maffiya there was an article in the newpaper concerning a front company that I had read about in the book. The book covered a lot of information to the extent that when I read the article I was thinking that there was a lot missing that they either don't know about or don't want to print. Check out YBM Magnetics, read this book and find out what they don't tell you.	2002-10-29

Most of the book focuses on how the mossad pick and train their agents, along with the author's experience with the training methods. It also touches upon the politics and foreign relationships within the intelligence community.<br /> The last part of the book details several missions of the Mossad from an insider's perspective. This gave real insight into details often missed when reading newspapers (often manipulated by the intelligence community).<br /> Buy the book, you will not be disappointed. This is a must have for any intelligence library.	2002-06-25

I would consider the book somewhat more of a psychological book, than a business book.<br />  In either case these tactics are an advantage to business people or any people wishing to learn more about handling yourself and others; it is true that seasoned businessmen will have probably have learned most of these lessons through their own experiences. But isn't it nice to have them all described neatly in a book, complete with example situations? Yes, I would say.<br /> The lessons are not taught only by Mossad. These tactics are taught also in European and Western spy programs. They are not unusual. Although it IS unusual and rare to have a book discuss these topics. I've seen very few books that broach the subject in such a exemplified and direct way.<br /> The only con to this book is that it reveals too many secrets. If you've stumbled upon this book and are considering buying it, then do so. You will either be hooked by the book for its spy stories or it's 'secrets' of psychological control.<br /> enjoy..	2002-04-25

The only contention I had with the book was that it was misleading in the description that it explains how to preform hypnosis. It does not do that. This book is written for the professional Hypnotherapist and not a novice person who wants to gain an understanding on how hypnosis works and is performed.<br />  The book essentially explains what things you can do to better your skills once you attain the basics of hypnosis/hypnotherapy. It goes on about how you can use such and such method to each a desired outcome but assumes you know how to perform that method. So it is definately not a beginners book.<br />  With that said, the reviews are correct in saying that it is written in a style for everyone to understand. It is very readable and well written.	2002-04-23

Its obvious from Daniel's book that he's done his research right in getting the feel and capabilities of the agents fictionalized in the book. I urge you to read the resources that he lists at the end of the book as well if you want more info.<br /> The book is set in modern times, concerning an Israeli agent who's mastered the art of restoration as a cover to such a degree that he in fact became one of the world's best art restorers. The story does not circle around this fact. It is about the chase of an old rival bent on destoying the mideast peace process and the details involved in preparing and executing the mission from both sides.<br /> There are some twists in the end of the story to be sure. It is a fast paced, action adventure story that takes you across Europe which also touches upon both side (Israeli/Palestinian) views of the peace process and the history of Isreal.<br /> I will be definately reading more books of this sort from Daniel Silva.	2002-04-23

I found this book to be a very enjoyable adventure mixed with history and interesting characters. It didn't go into the history very deeply, nor in the adventure/action, so I considered the book to be 'light'.<br /> With that said, I intend to get more books from Iain Pears. And I can see by his writing style that he probably is capable of writing a good literary historical fiction novel. And from what I understand 'An Instance at the Fingerpost' is such a novel. I'd be interested in seeing him write more books of this nature.<br /> The book delivered what it promised; art, history, and some adventure.	2002-01-11

Every chapter goes into little to no detail about any subject. There's lots of rambling code that's not explained. You can get that code off the net with explaination for free. This book does nothing useful except compile printouts of some code. Not only that, but there are hardly any mention of advanced hacking techniques. Who needs explaination of how to code in C. Buy a book on C, don't rehash the whole thing (badly) just to fill pages. I felt like everything in the book was done just to make it bigger.<br /> Everything that is on the CD is printed out in the pages. So you see page after page of code with no comments or explaination other than &quot;this code will do a denial of service attack with some modification&quot;. Who cares, there's no explaination of how and why the attack works or how to prevent it!<br /> If you are a novice, perhaps you'll get some information from this book. But at it's price you are better off without it. For anyone more advanced, avoid this book altogether. There is not even a discussion on how to block against these hacks! Believe me, I scanned the book looking for anything worthwhile. I couldn't beleive it, there was nothing! He lists a bunch of unix commands like &quot;cd, awk, etc..&quot; and then says &quot;these commands can be exploited to gain root&quot;. Well, how? He doesn't even explain anything at all!!<br /> If you've been around then you will not learn anything new from this book. He doesn't even talk about buffer overflows, come on. I was so disappointed.<br />  I made the mistake of taking all the stars for the book as meaning it's a good book. The index misleads you to think the  subjects listed are covered, but they are not. Merely, mentioning something doesn't classify it as being discussed.<br /> I give it one star because I couldn't give less, I'm sorry.<br /> If you want something worhwhile to read then read books by Bruce Shneider. At least he knows a little something about security.<br /> :(little something about security. <br /> :(	2001-08-10
