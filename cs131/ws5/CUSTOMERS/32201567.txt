If you have any feelings for animals, particularly dogs, you should love this book.  The story is one of personal growth in the art of living for self as well as for others...human and animal.  It is meeting great challenge in doing something never done before and supreme satisfaction in a job well done.  Your heart strings will be pulled if you do read this and a better person for it.	2005-09-05

There is a lot of fact mixed up with the author's creation with a multitude of reference you can check for yourself. <br />The story will keep yu on the edge of your seat and at the same time there is enough mystery to satisfy the most discerning reader.  There is a good reason why this is now a best seller; deservedly so.  It also points out the stubborness of some people after much proof is given of why they are wrong, yet refuse to change their minds...usually because of vested interests.	2005-04-27

The twists and turns in her life are like a corkscrew where changes are constant, but purpose remains strong.  The author is the most down-to-earth academician I have ever known including my brother who is a retired professor.  If you want a marvelous reading experience, then get this book.

Like Phyllis Diller, I read a most wonderful book \\"The Magic of Believing\\" by Claude Bristol when I was in my early 20's that did change my life, but not to the extent that she transformed herself because of that book.  Many miserable things happened to her traveling through her life journey, but she was always optimistic and overcame the adversities.  This book has funny parts, however, it is really an autobiography and details the life of the author.  A marvelous read and a story that should get more than 5 stars.	2005-03-21

You discover that Communisim is a disastrous joke and wonder how it lasted as long as it did...and does in a few countries still.  The author does a masterful job of writing about her life as it was from age 5 to 10 and conveys to the reader the innocence and excitement and concern of what is important to a young child.  The big sister is in her story who adds to her troubles at times and the fact that her father is fired from many many jobs due to his resistance of the political regime, yet is able to always be optimistic and find other ways to get work has an important part also.

There was nothing I could discover of explaining why we're here.  Nevertheless, this is a fine book that does reassure us of an afterlife from an author who has had more than her share of life problems and heartache.  Some of it was brought about by herself, such as allowing her husband to almost kill her more than once and not leave him 'til around 15 years had passed.  This is an autobiography and most interesting indeed.  She talks of events that happened to her and of her realization that she could communicate with the other side of life and how she has helped others for many years now.  A good read!	2004-11-05

The Potato Factory is an interesting title and most significant, but not what you might think.  The time period is the early 1800's and most reminiscent of what Charles Dickens would write.  The first half of the 832 pages in the pocketbook takes place in London and the second half in Australia.  This story has many, many layers and all are easy to keep track of.  Most of the problems are resolved by the end, but a major one would be explained and expanded in Tommo & Hawk as I shall soon discover.  The writing is superb and the characters are etched in your memory for all time.  The subjet matter is crass in the first half, yet is the foundation for what happens in the second half.  This is a tale of Australia's beginnings and an engrossing one you will not put down 'til finished.	2004-09-12

The author is a retired N.Y. Times foreign correspondent who attends his retirement party in Manhattan and then the next day starts walking to Vermont (near Hanover) where he is going to live.  He walks on the Appalachian Trail where the distance is almost 400 miles and he accomplishes this in 5 weeks moving through 5 states.  He tells of his experiences while on the trail with frequent interjections of incidences overseas while doing his work for his newspaper.  I feel he could have elaborated more about his overseas experiences as they were interesting, but they took up from one paragraph to one page...oh well, I guess that is another book.  He meets some interesting characters on the way, but because of the nature of his quest, nothing is permanent.  I thought he hiked in a most sensible manner as every so often he would rent a motel/cabin, get a good meal in a local cafe, and take a shower/bath to clean off all the accumulated crud, and stop in to see past friends in their homes (which were on the way) and stay for a day or two.  He accomplished lhis goal and derived great satisfaction in doing so and then wrote a book about it.	2004-09-02

Mark was a hippie in the literal sense and took decades for him to decide what he was supposed to do in this life.  He never had any money, yet would do odd jobs in his neighborhood on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco to provide food and sunflower seeds for the parrots in his neighborhood.  He never had to pay rent and lived in a dilapidated house, but his loving nature shone through in what he did...and that was nurture a flock of parrots where he named most of them and grew to understand their personality and personal traits.  He tells all in this book and a wonderful story it is.  You learn the joy of freedom in Mark and the birds and his telling in a well written story.  One great loss in his life was never finding a woman to love, but in the end he discovers his mate and he was taken completely by surprise.  You will too, if you read this book.

At that time I formulated my opinion that about 90% of the inmates were there due to their parents. This book has reinforced that opinion 55 years later...and nothing has changed except there are more people incarcerated today than then. This book is an eye-opener about a life/society that I knew nothing about. It is about extreme violence, heavy drugs and booze, and sexual activity non stop. It is about how you can waste your life if you participate. 'Tis hard to believe the author did not yet attend college when he wrote this as the quality of writing is very good. You learn a lot about gangs by reading this. To quote on page 229: &quot;Adults in the neighborhood contributed to the loss of a generation by turning their backs and never seeing anything...didn't bother to help those who did try to stop the violence. Both a retired police officer and a Chicago Transit Authority bus driver who lived in the neighborhood directly contributed to gang activity.

His serious occupation did not develop until his early 40's (along with his marriage) and the story of how he arrived there is very interesting.  He was responsible for much of what you see on cable television today and his ideas of what to look for in finding a job for yourself is enlightening.

Her brother is killed in an accident at a young age and she is so devistated that it ruins her life and she is unable to overcome the shock all during the book.

She is American through and through, yet her parents were from China and she has many relatives there.  Amy has an academic background, yet is down to earth with language for the common man and a sense of humor that is refreshing.  Her mother is a major influence in her life and stories about her are very, very different from the &quot;typical&quot; American mother; you will enjoy!  Amy talks about the process of creating stories and, like other authors, she has no idea where all the gist for her mill comes from.

It was published by Nan A. Talese, an imprint of Doubleday, but I doubt if any editing was done whatsoever.  There are too many ill constructed sentences and words and sentences repeated to add emphasis.  However, none of this detracts materially as the story is just too powerful.  James Frey was a drug/alcohol junkie from around age 8 and lasted until he was on his last leg at age 23 when he entered a residential treatment center.  You learn of his unconventional life, but you also find out what it is like being an addict.  How one lives from one hit to another.  One man by the name of Leonard literally saves James's life and to read of how this is accomplished is worth the price of admission.  Even though fraternizing with the opposite sex is forbidden in this residential center, there is a love affair that is an important result of Mr. Frey's recovery.  This true story is amazing in its complexity and you find out what happened to all of the characters you meet on the very last page.  Whatta read!	2004-05-07

This is the premise of the whole book, but you would not believe what they had to go through to accomplish this mission.  In fact, the story of how this child came to be is a story all by itself as covered in the Prologue.  A fine read with a reminder of what it is like in countries other than the U.S.A.	2004-03-02

However, those that took their content to heart has their story revealed here.  Carlos lived his stories 24 hours a day as did his many followers.  He controlled many many lives pervasively and this is Amy Wallace's story of the results of that control.  'Tis amazing and something I will never understand....allowing someone else to take over my life including the disavowing of family and acquaintences because Carlos says so.  Even after his death from cancer, he is missed terribly by his followers.  I do think the story was a little long and could have been pared down about 50 pages.	2003-12-01

She always blames everyone but herself and uses her good looks and talent to create waves of good fortune...for a time only.  This is a story of extremes and greed and I was enthralled through the entire book.  Chris, the husband, was a good guy; his wife Liysa had horns growing out of her head she was so evil.

Most of the time (never always) the route is circuitous before a life's occupation is finally realized.  In this case Pete Hamill is talented from childhood due to a creative brain and the ability to draw.  This lead to many many adventures and the final destination of author.  What a trip!

The proper designation is Criminal Investigative Analysis, but I like to consider it as an educational course in learning to be a Sherlock Holmes in real life.  It is taught at the fBI Academy and is a 10 month program.  Another contribution for the author was his practice of Shorinji Kempo, a marital arts discipline (this led me to an interesting inquiry into that subject).

Around 15 years is the time period of investigation and this case was finalized in the year 2000.  All up-to-date stuff.  You discover the history of DNA and its application to crime detection which is a fascinating subject and also the fact that hundreds of inmates have been released from prison as it was proven they were innocent.  The thrust of this story however, are the deeds of David Frediani, his incredible self-made alibis, those who helped him (a handful of people), and how he was eventually brought to justice because of the work of a handful of law enforcement people.  I thought if the volume was cut by about 25 pages it would have rated 5 stars.  This is one of the early detections using DNA and if it had occured much earlier then Mr. Frediani would have gotten away free...forever.	2003-10-01

Using his mimicry and ability to extemporize he has become most successful and did not go through the usual number of failures that most have to get into show biz.  It seems, while still in high school, he just got involved in acting and was seen by one of importance while auditioning and hired on the spot.

You get a lot of current history in his story, particularly the events on 9/11 and the year 2000 election, but much much more than that.

He certainly puts in long hours in preparation, but that goes along with his job.  The author states, \\"In the American Legal System, a lawyer's job is not to seek justice, but to win the case for his client.\\"  He relates many interesting cases, but two exceptional ones are defending a rapist who is truly mentally defective and one about defending the \\"Chicago Eight\\" in 1968.  A lot of detailed information about that political incident is fascinating.  Mr. Tucker does a lot of pro bono work and one of this type was defending the Contract Buyers League in Chicago...a race conflict of great proportions.

I would call it a saga as it is a story that envelops you and I spent a week getting through the 544 pages.  The main characters are Fiona and Joe, however, there are many more and all easy to keep track of.  There are 2 or 3 dastardly villains, and they keep you on edge at times, but the main thrust is of feelings before doings.

Though it is different now, when she was a young girl, the Moso did not read nor write and their entire history was oral.  Also, the only holidays they celebrated were two in number.  This is the first positive story about China I have read.  The Cultural Revolution did touch the Moso, but in a minor way as they live in the middle of nowhere.

He had too many valleys in his life (don't most of us?}and the peaks were short lived.  There is no gossip in this book, but an interesting story for all...not just movie buffs.	2003-03-16
