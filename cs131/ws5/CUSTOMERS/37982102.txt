First, pious works of small persuasiveness which merely rehash dogma heard interminably since childhood.  Second, romantic and preposterous tales of Jesus running off to the Cote d'Azur with Mary Magdalene, or alternatively, to the Mysterious East to study at the feet of various yogis, swamis, sadhus, pandits, fakirs, bonzes, and lamas.  Third, anachronistic depictions of Jesus as a first century version of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara leading a Judean liberation movement and murdered by the Fascist Roman power structure for his pains.  Fourth and last, judicious and careful works of scrupulous scholarship by historians acknowledged as leading lights in their field by peers (e.g., E. P. Sanders, Paula Fredrikson), even those peers who may have scholarly disagreements with the author.  This book belongs to the forth category.<br /><br />Professor Vermes has devoted over half a century to the study of first-century Palestine and shares some of the results of his investigations in this book.  It is entirely devoid of pedantry and alive with bracing insights into the world Jesus lived and died in.  Some reviewers here have made much of what they take to be insufficient documentation, but citations are easily found in Professor Vermes' earlier works that this book draws upon.  A history written for non-specialists need not be excessively freighted with notes and other scholarly apparatus.<br /><br />Professor Vermes' method is to carefully dig away the layers of theological encrustation that formed over the narrative of Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament by a sort of painstaking literary archaeological dig.  This is aided by careful study of other remaining records of the period including those by classical historians such as Flavius Josephus and Tacitus.  Where Professor Vermes really shines is in his careful attention to and  interpretation of writings by Jewish contemporaries of Jesus, some of which (e.g., the Dead Sea scrolls) have only come to light in modern times.  Until relatively recently, these sources have been mostly ignored.  Even when they have been studied, it has often been more for the purpose of extracting facile glosses then of providing illumination.  The author draws a convincing portrait of first-century Palestine as a land febrile with apocalyptic and eschatological expectation.  Prophets and wonder-workers of every description were active, and Jesus was fully a part of the matrix of first-century Judaism.  Despite longstanding belief that it was envy and malice, first from the Pharisees and Temple priests, then from the Jewish crowds that caused the execution of Jesus; Professor Vermes concludes that apprehension for the safety of the crowds in Jerusalem during Passover caused the priests and officials to arrest Jesus and hand him over to the Romans.  He was then put to death in the barbarous manner prescribed by Roman law and custom for seditionists and revolutionaries.  His followers were left untouched however-a puzzling omission the Romans would scarcely have made had they thought Jesus a genuine revolutionary and his followers a real threat (or even potential threat) to their rule.  When the Romans put down the slave rebellion led by Sparticus, the roads leading out of Rome were lined on either side with thousands of crucified rebels for miles around.  All sources (including Roman ones) agree that Pontius Pilate was a brutal man, even by Roman standards.  (He eventually would be removed from office because of his cruelty by the Emperor Tiberius, whose own harshness was legend.)  He would not have hesitated the slightest in condemning a wholly innocent man to die out-of-hand.  The idea that he meekly acceding to the wishes of a Jewish mob baying for Jesus' blood as attributed by the gospels is utterly fantastic by all evidence, including the rest of the gospels themselves.  The disturbance provoked in the Temple precincts by Jesus among the moneychangers and merchants in the days prior to the Passover was sufficient to seal his tragic fate.  He might have only been whipped and released with a warning--as was done to others who had disturbed the peace--had things happened at a less tense moment.<br /><br />As everyone knows, in the decades after the execution of Jesus, the early Christian movement spread throughout the Roman world to Gentiles as well as Jews.  Tragically as things would turn out, it began to change form as it became ever more removed in time and space from Jesus' lifetime in Galilee and Judea.  With repeated warfare and destruction in Palestine during the reigns of the Emperors Vespasian and Hadrian, the organized Jewish community was decimated and scattered, and could not serve as a check on the process of transformation.  The virile Jesus, concrete in word and deed, became the pallid, spectral Christ of Faith; enthroned in heaven and silent in his eternal, sacred calm while his earthly viceroys spoke and ruled for him.  A non-hierarchical movement that began in the Galilean countryside among independent tradesmen, small farmers, and fisherman, all of them Jews, became centered upon the abject and deracinated Gentile masses of Roman cities, most descended from slaves with the mark of servility still upon them.  They were lorded over by a celestial bureaucracy that emulated the Empire at a time when it  had become an absolute despotism, and the rights of Roman citizens had virtually disappeared.  Most tragic of all, the fissure that opened between Gentile Christians and Jews (including Jewish followers of Jesus) would grow into a chasm of mutual enmity and suspicion,  manifestations of which would range from slurs in the writings of Church fathers such as Saint John Chrysostom and reformers such as Martin Luther, to murder at the hands of medieval European peasants and their twentieth century descendants who served as camp guards, trusties, auxiliary police, German and foreign SS troops, and indifferent bystanders.<br /><br />This book is rendered in clear, graceful, and gracious prose that displays the author's goodwill on nearly every page.  His comments are touched with a gentle irony here and there that is certain to discomfit a certain type of Christian all the more for being so marvelously devoid of rancor or bitterness.  This in spite of the profoundly tragic loss of Professor Vermes' family during the Holocaust.  By way of comparison, the comments on display in negative reviews here tell all that we need to know about the writers' intellect, and rather more than cared to know about their character.  (Accusations of poisoning wells and of draining the blood of Christian children to make matzos are the only things missing from these reviews.)<br /><br />Ultimately, the Jesus we meet in these pages is the Jesus we always knew; the Galilean who preferred the rough company of the poor and \\"sinners\\" to anyone else, and who gave them the encouragement and strength they needed to endure and reform their hard lives.

The idea of founding a church appears to have been the furthest thing from his mind.  When we glimpse him through the mists of time and the smoke of myth, we do not see the awe-inspiring figure crowned with golden riza and riding on the clouds of glory; still less do we see the scowling, terrifying Christ Pantocrator, i.e., Judge of the Universe.  Thanks to decades of careful, patient work by Professor Vermes and other scholars, we see the man of gentle visage and steel-eyed determination who feared no one but God, and of whom none should be afraid.

(The title of this review is a quotation from Saint Augustine.)<br /><br />Compared to his colorless successors, Nikita Khrushchev remains a remarkable and vivid character even across the gulf of more than forty year since his abrupt fall from power.  Professor Taubman, with the help of declassified documents from Communist and U.S. archives, and extensive interviews with Khrushchev's family and associates has produced a massive (for some, too massive) biography that outshines all others.  Not only in depth of detail, but also in the astuteness of the author's  judgements of Khrushchev's character and motivation.<br /><br />The most interesting parts for me were those chapters on Khrushchev's rise though the Communist Party apparatus in Ukraine and Moscow at a time when a single false step, such as not meeting Stalin's gaze when he stared at you, meant imprisonment, torture, and death--not only for you, but for your family as well.<br /><br />While Khrushchev was able to save a few friends and subordinates (when it was safe for him to do so) from the mad purges, the appalling thing was how much of a faithful servant of Stalin's will and whim he really was.  For example, while in charge of incorporating western Ukraine--formerly ruled by Poland--into Soviet territory after World War II, Khrushchev ordered the murder of Ruthenian Catholic Bishop Teodor Romzha by an injection of poison while Romzha was recovering in a hospital from injuries received in a previous assassination attempt.  During the \\"Yezovschina\\" of 1937-38 (named after secret police chief Yezov, who administered the terror and was later consumed by it), Khrushchev, like his Politburo colleagues, signed off on death lists containing the names of hundreds of \\"enemies of the people\\".  If he was not the worst of Stalin's henchmen, then one of Stalin's henchman he certainly was.<br /><br />Amazingly, this brutal man did not utterly lose his humanity in this nest of serpents as did such fellow Politburo members and arch-Stalinist ghouls as Lazar Kaganovitch (an anti-Semitic Jew and Khrushchev's early patron), Lavrenty Beria (Stalin's last secret police chief and a serial rapist of underage girls), and Vyacheslav Molotov (the Foreign Minister, described by Winston Churchill as \\"a robot\\").  Instead, after Stalin's death Khrushchev managed to outfox them all to become the (almost) undisputed leader of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Despite its monumental inadequacies (not least about his own complicity), Khrushchev's 1956 `de-Stalinization' speech must be set down as an act of genuine courage on his part.  Millions of families who lost loved ones to the purges also carried the shame of being related to an \\"enemy of the people\\".  This belated admission of the victims' innocence was like the lifting of a great shroud from the land.  Not until Mikhail Gorbachev's time would Stalin's crimes be openly discussed again at such length and in such detail.  As a result of the speech, fossilized Stalinists on the Politburo would attempt to depose Khrushchev the following year.  Thanks to the help of his ally, Red Army Marshal Zhukov, who flew Party leaders from all over the country to Moscow on military planes to vote down the conspirators, Khrushchev was able to fend off the attempt and to demote  his enemies or force them out of the Politburo.  In 1958, Zhukov himself would get the boot from the recipient of his benefactions.<br /><br />Turning to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, given what we now know it seems even more of a miracle that most of the Northern Hemisphere was not destroyed.  Khrushchev seemed amazed that the United States would react so badly to the discovery of Soviet intermediate-range missiles in Cuba.  In his view, he was merely protecting Castro, a fellow Communist, from U.S. invasion, not trying to offset Soviet weakness in strategic range missiles.  He had no backup plan if things did not work out as hoped.  Did he then remember the sight of thousands of German corpses burning on oil-fed pyres made of railroad ties after the Soviet victory at Stalingrad?  Whatever influenced Khrushchev's thinking, we can all be grateful that he and John Kennedy-both of whom had a broad streak of reckless impulsiveness-were able to defuse the crisis in spite of everything that could have gone wrong.  (Ranging from the downing of a U-2 over Cuba by a Soviet surface-to-air missile, to a U.S. warship trying to force a Soviet sub equipped with nuclear-tipped torpedoes to surface by bracketing it with depth charges.)  Although the Kennedy administration avoided rubbing his nose in it, everyone understood the agreed-upon withdrawal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba to be a defeat, something that would return to haunt Khrushchev in the bill of particulars drawn up against him when he was finally removed from power two years later.<br /><br />Khrushchev had high hopes of humanizing and reforming Communism, but the consciousness of his failure to do so afflicted him in his last years in power and beyond.  (Alexander Dubcek in Czechoslovakia and Mikhail Gorbachev would also fail at this futile task.)  This ebbing of morale allowed his own worst traits to come to the fore, including his hunger for accolades, his unwillingness to listen to sound advice, his impetuosity, and his mercurial temper.  Although he sensed the machinations against him by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, and other members of the Politburo during the summer and early fall of 1964, he remained strangely passive; seemingly unwilling to believe such a thing as forcible removal from power could really happen to him.  Recalled from a vacation at his Black Sea dacha in October 1964 to an unscheduled session of the Politburo, he defended his record in a stormy two-day series of meetings, but to no avail.  Accepting the offer of a Moscow dacha and a pension in exchange for his resignation from all government and party posts, he virtual disappeared from public view overnight.<br /><br />At first, Khrushchev was shattered by the suddenness and completeness of his fall.  (\\"Grandfather cries all the time.\\", said his school-age grandson to an inquiring teacher.)  But he rallied and began to compose his sometimes revealing, sometimes self-serving memoirs, portions of which he had smuggled to the West for publication.  Near the end of his life, perhaps prompted by intimations of his own mortality and guilt at his role, Khrushchev bitterly lamented the colossal toll of the purges; all to no purpose, he realized.  He died of a heart attack in 1971.<br /><br />It is difficult to see how Professor Taubman's biography can ever be surpassed.  The tone of his writing is finely balanced between scrupulous fairness, human sympathy, incisive comment, and scholarly detachment towards a man who merits all of these.  A Roman historian's comment about Lucius Annaeus Seneca-one of the Emperor Nero's consuls-could serve as Khrushchev's epitaph: \\"In order to work some good, he let pass much evil.\\"of German corpses burning on oil-fed pyres made of railroad ties after the Soviet victory at Stalingrad?

US	37982102	R3IDYJJLHD3C0R	0877883068	493570815	Growth into Manhood: Resuming the Journey	Books	2	27	84	N	N	The author is a nice guy but...	At a low point in my life some years ago and at the inducement of a misguided friend; I attended some sessions of Mr. Medinger's \\"ex-gay\\" group, \\"Regeneration\\".  (Both my friend and I ended up leaving--along with many others, but that is another story.)  This book has many of the qualities that I observed in Mr. Medinger at that time:  a kindly, avuncular manner, a pleasant and clear style of communicating, fervent Christian faith--and complete ignorance of what an untroubled, healthy gay man is like.<br /><br />It is plain from his book that he regarded himself, and regards all gay men as suffering from a lack of masculinity that can be cured by learning how to 'act butch' from an appropriately masculine man.  If this sounds facetious or oversimplified, consider that his organization regularly held softball games to help those cursed with individuality achieve the good ol' American and Christian conformity of team sports.  Then, if the person is lucky, he will grow into a heterosexual role, perhaps even marrying (a woman that is).  Instruction in feminine dress and deportment was given to lesbians (who were greatly underrepresented--perhaps women have more sense) to transform them into normal girls--in other words, into \\"a minx, a moron, and a parasite\\" to quote C.S. Lewis on the parody of femininity which conservative Christians seem to hold up as their ideal.  In one instance that I know of, a gay man jubilantly declared himself 'cured' (he wasn't), then announced his planned marriage to a lesbian also enrolled in the program.  (Thank God--literally--it never came off.)  A wag remarked that such an arrangement would at least be better than if they had each married heterosexual spouses--this way there would only be two people made miserable instead of four.<br /><br />Just because Mr. Medinger felt himself inadequate as a man is no reason to project this onto all gay men.  Many, perhaps most gay men would pass anybody's criteria for masculinity-unless, of course, homosexuality is automatically equated with unmanliness, in which case no amount of reality will influence such views.  Evidently for some, Greg Louganis can't possibly be a real man or a real athlete despite executing one of the finest dives in the history of the Olympics while wracked with severe pain from bone spurs, a vicious stomach upset, and a near-concussion brought on by striking his head on the diving board earlier.  (But he has AIDS, still regarded as divine punishment by most conservative Christians although this view tends to be cloaked in Uriah Heep-ish saccharine these days.)<br /><br />To confuse matters for those who think Real Men can't be gay (and vice-versa), many heterosexual men display effeminate mannerisms, pastimes, or occupations.  Most male ballet dancer are not only resoundingly heterosexual, they are more athletic than football players because of the more rigorous training.  Also because they are not hobbled by injuries, past and present, and tend not to use the performance-enhancing drugs rampant in the hypercompetitive world of both professional and amateur sports.  (When are Christians going to start attacking a \\"lifestyle\\" that encourages--nay, requires the use of dangerous drugs beginning in adolescence that can cause cancer, testicular atrophy, and psychosis?  Not to mention the brazen cheating involved.  But hey--at least it's not pot, and it's more fun scourging gays anyhow.)  Finally, I have known some effeminate gay men who had the hearts of lions; their spirits unbowed, their nobility and integrity intact despite the ill-treatment--from taunts on the street to murder--routinely dished out to them by Christians and even by some gays.  If conformity to social norms is the ideal for American Christians, then perhaps those KGB \\"psychiatrists\\" who used to perform \\"reparative therapy\\" on Soviet dissidents (some of them Christian believers) tossed into asylums weren't so bad after all.<br /><br />As I have intimated above, most gay men find their way to a book like this (and its associated groups) at a low point in their lives.  In my case, I was unhappily stuck in a career rut, but in other cases hapless men had been remanded to Mr. Medinger's group by the courts after being caught \\"en flagrante\\" in some public place.  These unfortunates, frequently married, feeling ashamed not only of their circumstances but also of being gay and facing conviction (and a public record) as a sex offender, naturally leaped into Mr. Medinger's arms (so to speak).  Has it dawned on anyone but me that it is deeply immoral to take advantage of these people, no matter how well-meaning you are?  Such doubly unfortunate men would not have found out from this book that a gay man can live an upright and satisfying life, find friendship, support, and--who knows?--maybe even love, if they come out and meet well-adjusted gays instead of secretly skulking about parks and restrooms.<br /><br />To conclude, I must record here that Mr. Medinger once stated that--contrary to the assertion in this book--his attraction to men had not completely left him, although he was successfully suppressing it.  Normally, I would not divulge the substance of this conversation, except that it goes to the very heart of this very misguided and misguiding book., most gay men find their way to a book like this (and its associated groups) at a low point in their lives.

Until recently, my only acquaintance with Mr. Derbyshire was in his role as a somewhat disagreeable controversialist in \\"National Review\\" magazine.  Then, I noticed his most recent book (as of this posting), \\"Prime Obsession\\", a non-fiction account of the work of 19th century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, whose prime number theorum remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in mathematics.  Through the capsule biography of the author, I found out the existance of this book and consulted the reviews here.<br /><br />Having read \\"Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream\\", I can say that it fully lives up to the sometimes-extravagant praise posted here.  The book has a quirky charm all its own, not least because of the first-person voice of its hero, Chai, a winning and fascinating personality.  Since the plot has been fully discussed in other reviews here, I will limit myself to a few random observations.<br /><br />--Chai's account of his participation in the Red Guards as a teenager reads like a chiller out of Chen Jo-Hsi's book, \\"The Execution of Mayor Yin, and Other Tales of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\\"  His witnessing of a gang-rape (which he feigns participation in) shames him and destroys at a stroke any loyalty to the Party he may have had.  This starts him on his long road to America.<br /><br />--Like Joseph Conrad in England, Chai masters the intricacies of English while in America.  His ironic and insightful observations of the United States, China, and Hong Kong (before the PRC took over) are fun to read and dead-on.<br /><br />--The long-dead Calvin Coolidge appears to give some dry and intelligent advice.  Mr. Derbyshire manages to squash the old legend of \\"Silent Cal\\" as unintelligent and indolent.  While the author perhaps spreads it a mite too thick, it is still a useful and entertaining corrective.  (I hold with the political scientist who believes that Mr. Coolidge's apparent indolence was the result of a deep--perhaps clinical--depression at the death of his 16-year old son, Calvin Jr. from septicemia caused by an infected blister on his foot that had been raised playing tennis on the White House lawn.)<br /><br />All of this is just by-the-by, however.  The book was simply a delight and I urge anyone whose interest has been piqued by these comments to read it just as I did.16-year old son, Calvin Jr. from septicemia caused by an infected blister on his foot that had been raised playing tennis on the White House lawn.)

(Instead, we now have pedants writing more and more about less and less.)  To be sure, there are plenty of works in the genre that are treacly with sentimentality, dull with didacticism, or inaccurate with facts (sometimes all three).  This book is none of these, and while it is certainly not the last word, I can think of no better starting point for those wishing to explore Roman history.<br /><br />By taking some of the focus off political and military matters and including everything from descriptions of the everyday life of subjects and citizens, to beautiful and illuminating excerpts from Roman literature, Durant brings to life a vanished world and makes the reader eager to learn more.  For my own part, I doubt I would have come across the poetry of Horace (I am now but the latest member of his 2000 year-old fan club.) had I not read this book.<br /><br />One of the charms of the book is the astuteness of so many of Durant's judgments.  For example, he is perhaps the first English-language historian to write of the Emperor Tiberius as something other than a monster of vice and cruelty.  Interestingly, most modern historians of the subject would probably agree with Durant that the picture of Tiberius painted by gossip-mongers such as Suetonius and novelists such as Robert Graves is an enduring libel.  Instead, the author writes movingly of then-Emperor Augustus commanding his chosen successor Tiberius to divorce the beloved Vipsania Aggripina and marry the loathsome Julia, to further Augustus' plans for a dynasty.  You start to get a better idea of what is meant by the phrase, \\"the tragic sense of life\\" when you read of such things here.<br /><br />Durant's discussion of the life of Jesus and the origins of Christianity tracks well with recent detailed studies of the historical Jesus by such investigators as Geza Vermes, E.P. Sanders, and Paula Fredrikson.  Readers may well disagree with his opinion of the provenance of the miracles recorded in the New Testament, but they will agree that it is at least informed speculation.<br /><br />I have to agree with H.L. Mencken (who had dismissed Durant as a \\"mere popularizer\\"), when Mencken recorded in his diary that to his surprise, \\"Caesar and Christ\\" was \\"a thing of extraordinary merit...  full of sound sense and sound learning, [and] wholly free of sentimentality.

Despite the off-putting smugness of this book's title Professor McGrath proves to be a genial writer who has some interesting insights on theism and atheism.  Unfortunately, the book is also marred by misconceptions that are surprising given the author's obvious intellect and learning.  To start, I am not sure that atheism is entering the twilight that the good professor claims.  In the industrialized world, secularism seems entrenched in Europe and Japan, and is increasing even in that swamp of Christian piety, the United States.  To be sure, membership in evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant sects has also increased, as has the number of Catholics, but as any sociologist of religion knows, figures on denominational membership are imprecise to say the least.  The result of carefully designed and overlapping public opinion polls indicates that unbelief continues to gain ground in the U.S.  Turning to the underdeveloped world, Professor McGrath has a solid case (backed up by historian Philip Jenkins in his book, \\"The Next Christendom\\"), but surely the burgeoning numbers of third-world Christians has a great deal to do with the truly desperate conditions under which many of them live.  If I may modify remarks about Communism made by President Harry Truman before a joint session of Congress:  \\"(Religion is) nurtured by misery and want. It spreads and grows in the evil soil of poverty and strife. It reaches its full potential when the hope of a people for a better life has died.\\"  In the face of wide-scale social breakdown and the alienation felt by formerly rural populations jammed into anonymous megacities, is it any wonder that religion serves as a source of community and help?  On the other side of the coin, one might ask if religion will decline in third world societies as they transform into developed nations.<br /><br />Professor McGrath brings an interesting perspective to the growth of atheism in the nineteenth century.  He correctly notes that Karl Marx did not call for religious persecution; Marx simply thought religion would die off naturally in the envisaged workers' state because its consolations would no longer be needed.  (How wrong that was!)  He accurately quotes one of Marx's comments on religion:  \\"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.  It is the opium of the people.\\"  However he wrongly states that this complete quotation is Marx's most famous statement about religion.  Typically, only the last sentence is cited, and that is used to smear anyone to the left of Pat Robertson as hostile to religion.  There are several more consequential mistakes about the views of Sigmund Freud.  While Freud did compare religion to a mass neurosis, he chiefly viewed theistic religion as an illusion.  (The title of his most extended work on religion was his book, \\"The Future of an Illusion\\".)  An illusion is a misperception (as when someone mistakes a coil of rope in a darkened room for a snake, or thunder for the voice of the gods), in contrast to a delusion (a false idea) or a hallucination (a false perception originating entirely in the mind).  Illusions are not in themselves a psychiatric condition.  Contrary to what Professor McGrath implies, it would be considered a terrible breach of professional ethics for a psychotherapist to try to talk a client out of their religious beliefs.  Psychotherapists, like plumbers, are hired (or invited) by clients to perform the job at hand--not to give extraneous opinions.  Freud, whatever else one thinks of him, was entirely clear about that.  Certainly there are therapists so caught up in their hostility to theistic religion that they commit the malpractice of overstepping their bounds; certain fervid Christians who hang out a psychotherapist's shingle (e.g., practitioners of \\"reparative therapy\\") can be charged with similar offenses.<br /><br />An entire chapter is devoted to the noisy career (and terrible end) of Madalyn Murray O'Hair; but to what end?  I did not need Professor McGrath's account to know that Mrs. O'Hair was a dreadful shrew who loved the sound of her own voice.  Had she lived in a world of quiet agnostics, no doubt she would have wound up being a loud, obnoxious Christian, instead of a loud, obnoxious atheist.  She is no more representative of atheists then the carrion-faced Reverend Fred Phelps is typical of Christians.  Professor McGrath disapprovingly notes--among other unlovely traits--Mrs. O'Hair's antipathy towards homosexuals.  At this, I can only recommend to the Professor and other Christians some prudent prescriptions regarding motes, beams, and eyes.  In much of the United States today, it is still as dangerous for a known gay person (or someone merely thought to be such) to be out walking alone as it was (and sometimes still is) for an African American during the high noon of segregation.  Perhaps individual Christians cannot be blamed for this state of affairs, but it was not Mrs. O'Hair or other atheists who poisoned the atmosphere with incessant attacks on gays as putative `menaces' to the family, the nation, the Earth, the Moon, the Solar System, and the Universe beyond.<br /><br />Finally, and most bizarrely, the author pins his hopes for the return of religion on the rise of postmodernism.  To think it was the redoubtable C.S. Lewis who wrote that, \\"Radical subjectivism is the death of the society that embraces it.\\"  A descent into an abyss of irrationality and it's companion, superstition, is a wholly bad thing--especially in an age that has religious enthusiasts such as Osama bin-Laden eagerly combing the world in search of fissionable material to construct a bomb.  Unfortunately, Christians are not exempt from outbreaks of religious enthusiasm that start off commendably, but can degenerate quickly into hunts for scapegoats when the New Jerusalem fails to arrive on cue.  (See Norman Cohn's book, \\"Pursuit of the Millennium\\" for a fascinating-and sometimes grotesque-history of medieval millennialism.)  True, after the \\"witches\\" or Jews are burned, or the gay kid beaten to death, remorse may set in.  Then Christians swear a mighty oath not to do it again, which holds until they do it again.  Christians in search of corroboration of these points may wish to query gay or Jewish acquaintances, if they have any.<br /><br />Professor McGrath insists that atheism must fade because religion has lost its oppressiveness and atheism is increasingly seen as flogging a dead horse.  On the contrary, I predict that fanatical religion, armed with weapons from AK-47's to anthrax to tactical nukes, will produce (and is producing) a Golden Age of worldwide conflicts that will rival-if not surpass-the death tolls of the twentieth century from secular totalitarianism.  (Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sudan are just curtain raisers.)  Secular, democratic societies should beware of conservative Christians and radical Muslims joining forces against them the way German Communists and Nazis joined forces against the Weimar Republic, or the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany allied against western democracies from 1939 to 1941.

At one point, he claims that the Clinton Administration's Health Security Initiative failed to make it into law because of the Administration's petty aversion to having the Catholic Church as an ally. This strange assertion will come as news to many, including Theda Skocpol, author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the Clinton health care proposal. Elsewhere, Professor Jenkins explores the pedigree of anti-Catholic prejudice in America in depth, but he fails to do the same for Vatican hostility to the United States which has a long pedigree of its own. Despite the good feelings towards the Catholic Church in the United States at independence (due in part to French aid against the British) and the disestablishment of Protestant churches, the Vatican regarded the U.S. \\"as the bastard brat of Jacobinism\\" (to quote Samuel Eliot Morison) and warned against the heresy of \\"Americanism\\". This hostility persisted right up until the papacy of John XXIII. Also, during the 19th century, the Vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion, freedom of thought, and freedom of conscience. This hostility persisted right up until the Second Vatican Council. Unfortunately, while none of the Vatican II reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of John Paul II, they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old Soviet constitution.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is deplorable that Roman Catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents. Such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. But the proper reaction to outrages committed against Catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice. There is an immense and inordinate effort by the Vatican in some countries (e.g., Poland, Italy, the United States) to manipulate civil-statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law. Even when the Vatican's efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people, (as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease) its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved. Although the authoritarian inclination of the Church is not a crime, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity. When the Church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies, or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right, neither the Vatican nor Professor Jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational and violent reactions increase. Therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination, lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the U.S. Constitution is a morally acceptable option. It is not.<br /><br />With all this in mind, decent Catholics should ask their Bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure American law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens, even while claiming not to do so. A careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative Catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead Catholics and the general public alike. For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws. Its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society. Some of these groups will use the word \\"democratic\\" to describe either the organization or its intended actions, yet they do not defend and promote the interests of American society; indeed, they even openly attack it. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to American liberty and pluralism. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a 'sacral state' ideology that denies the democratic nature of the United States, as well as the rights of every individual. This does not mean that conservative Catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion, but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens, they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self-indulgent.<br /><br />Jesus promised, \\"You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free\\" (Jn. 8:32). Conservative Catholics (including the hierarchy here and in the Vatican) should have the truth about American society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly. After all, without the defeat of Nazism and U.S. opposition to Soviet communism, the young Karol Wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff. There has never been a society in human history that afforded so many--Catholics included--the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the United States.

There can be no objections to critical examination of Lincoln or his policies, but this books' rampant falsehoods, omissions and distortions forever exempt it from informed and intelligent controversy. It is, indeed, more like totalitarian propaganda than scholarship. (The title of this review was Orwell's comment on the grotesque falsity of Stalinist propaganda during the Spanish Civil War. It certainly fits this book.)<br /><br />The author rattles the dry bones of state's rights, while studiously avoiding the all-important question: right to do what? --To enslave people? To censor the press and even personal correspondence of any remark deemed insufficiently enthusiastic about slavery? By contrast, discussion of the conduct of the war was completely unfettered in the North, with some newspapers attacking Lincoln as virulently as any Southern journal--or this book. There is something utterly weird about libertarians who cannot (or more likely, will not) recognize that the racial caste system of the Old South prefigured 20th century totalitarianism in its division of human beings into a 'Herrnvolk' oligarchy and 'Untermenschen' chattels. To be sure, there were no extermination camps, Gulags, or Einsatzgruppen, but the first steps down a drearily familiar road had been taken before being rudely interrupted by force of arms, the only thing that would stop it.<br /><br />Once more, we are treated to the old chestnut that slavery would have died a natural death had not meddlers like Lincoln interfered. This almost reads like a parody of Marx's prediction that the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' would wither away of its' own accord. Libertarian economists such as Mr. Dilorenzo seem so mesmerized by their idee-fixe of 'homo economicus' that they fail to grasp that the master-race mentality does not know or care a whit whether its dystopias are cost-effective or not. (After all, the masters are usually doing just fine, thank you.) Not only were the concentration camps a net economic drain on Nazi Germany; the cost in transport and manpower needed to keep feeding the gas chambers 'til the last possible moment came at the expense of the Wehrmacht. (Perhaps I should have had the tact not to bring up the Nazis; many libertarians and paleoconservatives seem just as eager to ignore or minimize their atrocities and execrate Churchill and Roosevelt.)<br /><br />One leaves a book like this with a kind of bemused wonderment at those Americans whose perverse hostility towards their own country easily matches that of a defeated KGB officer, a Nazi (or Serbian) war criminal, or an Islamist.t the master-race mentality does not know or care a whit whether its dystopias are cost-effective or not.

Congratulations are due Professor McInerny for a masterful rebuttal of all those vile, horrid, nasty, depraved, vicious, disgusting, cruel, evil, false, base, and not-nice rumors about the Church during the Second World War.  He has undertaken a Herculean bout of cut-and-paste research, presenting the results with a winning literary style compounded of querulousness and bile.  The good professor wisely avoided consulting unreliable works by secular academic historians such as Saul Friedlander, Guenter Lewy, and Walter Lacquer; (What should those names tell you?) not to mention libels from turncoats such as John Morley, Michael Phayer, and Susan Zuccotti.  (It would have been the stake for them in the good old days!)  This current campaign of defamation is, of course, a vast secret conspiracy masterminded by dissident Catholics, adherents of a certain non-Christian religion, Freemasons, liberals, and--worst of all--sodomites!  The ranks of the Nazis, of course, were pervaded with sodomites so it should come as no surprise that there should be an attempt to shift the onus for their atrocities onto the One True Church.<br /><br />Why, only last night I saw perverts prancing about in Nazi-style garb at the local leather bar where I often repair to once my wife, six children, and grandchildren are all safely asleep.  (I am studying sexual immorality in order to denounce it, I'll have you know!)  There I sat, nursing my usual Shirley Temple while filthy and obscene acts unfolded before my fascinated gaze.  Finally, overcome with longing--er, loathing--I abandoned my emission--uh, my mission--and fled the sordid scene for home.  (Must remember:  Aquinas says self-pollution more heinous than rape!)

Since this was first posted, some reviews by children have appeared here.  From the look of them, they were presumably assigned by a teacher or teachers seeking to pad the number of five-star rankings.  No mention is made that the title incident of \\"She Said Yes\\" is only a pretty story without foundation in fact.  This abuse of young minds constitutes what even most Christians would judge to be aggravated fraud.  Jesus said it would be better for those who mislead the \\"little ones\\" to be drowned in the depths of the sea with a millstone around their necks.  Judging from the children's reviews here, Stone Mountain in Georgia would have to pulled down to supply enough granite to cut all those millstones.<br /><br />--(Original review)  This April (2004), the results of a summit the FBI convened three months after the Columbine massacre were released.  The panel included world-renowned mental health experts, among them psychiatrist Dr. Frank Ochberg of Michigan State University, and Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, a clinical psychologist and the FBI's lead Columbine investigator.  The panel had full access to diaries, homemade videos, and other revealing materials left behind by the killers.  Among other things, they concluded that Christians, including Cassie Bernal, were not singled out for execution.  (Neither were jocks, nerds, or anyone else.)  Eric Harris, the mastermind, appears to be a textbook case of a psychopath--utterly devoid of empathy or conscience, and killing indiscriminately.  Dylan Klebold, on the other hand was troubled and easily led by Harris.<br /><br />This only adds to the overwhelming weight of evidence found by investigators for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation that the title incident of this book is a Christian urban legend that never took place.  What did happen was that one of the killers posed 'the question' to another girl, Valeen Schnurr, after she had already been wounded. They had a short exchange, he reloaded, and while he was distracted, she crawled away to safety.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Bernal cannot be blamed for trying to pull some meaning and comfort from such a horrible tragedy.  What is nauseating is the sheer contempt for simple honesty shown by the publishers, their ghostwriters and publicity flacks, and assorted Christian teachers who try to use this young lady's casket as their soapbox.  Yes, yes, after the truth started leaking out, the Bernals wrote (or had published over their names) a evasive statement that makes a vapid apology to anyone who was \\"hurt or offended\\" by the book.  Instead of admitting they were wrong, they (and many reviewers here) take refuge in the possibility that it just MIGHT have happened as claimed--but the truth really doesn't matter anyway because the incident was only symbolic of Cassie's Christian faith.  Hmmm.  Can you imagine the uproar if an evangelical Christian released a book about the resurrection of Jesus from the dead; concluding that it was probably just a myth, but advising readers to pretend otherwise?  The honest thing would have been to withdraw \\"She Said Yes\\" from publication and eat the loss, instead of continuing to hawk it as if the title incident really took place.  Everyone seems clueless that all of this puts Christianity in a worse light than anything a religious skeptic could say.<br /><br />More honest and honorable Christians may want to gently point out to their brethren that this book makes Christians look like credulous fools, not only to those horrible liberal secularists, but to conservative politicians who think they will swallow anything--such as trumped-up pretexts for starting a war.she had already been wounded.

Michelle Malkin's latest effusion is as fine an example as any of the depths to which today's Right has sunk (I voted for Reagan, by the way-twice).  She takes reasonable proposals (such as beefing up border security), and debatable issues (Should racial or ethnic profiling be used to safeguard air travel?) and wraps them around stuff sufficiently disgusting that only the fever-swamp right would touch it before now.  The trick here, of course, is getting your audience nodding in sweet agreement with you while you slowly bring out the lynching rope.<br /><br />It is one thing to look for enemy agents among a population in which they could hide, quite another to treat an entire population as the enemy.  Madame Malkin claims that she is not calling for a general round-up of all Arabs or Muslims, but her shining example of Japanese-American internment certainly belies this.  ALL Japanese-Americans living on the west coast of the United States were deported to what amounted to concentration camps.  The fact that prisoners were not shot, gassed, starved, or subjected to sadistic medical experiments, should not prevent us from using that phrase.  (It originates not with Nazis, but from the Spanish governor of Cuba from 1896 to 1897, General Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau, who set up camps to intern civilians--in abysmal conditions--during the revolt against Spanish rule.  It also referred to civilian internment camps set up by the British during the Boer War.)  Meanwhile in Hawaii, mass internments did not take place, even though the proportion of people of Japanese descent to the general population was far higher than on the U.S. Pacific coast.  Even if honorable men acted with good intentions in the continental U.S., they are responsible for stoking the inevitable hysteria that occurs at the outbreak of war, instead of containing it as was done in Hawaii.  Madame Malkin makes much of the fact that a thousand or so Japanese-American families \\"voluntarily\\" moved to camps in the interior.  They chose to leave after being targeted by vigilantes and California officials \\"suggested\\" that they move.  Some choice.<br /><br />As mischievous reviewers on this page have pointed out, there are al-Qaeda linked Moro separatists fighting on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.  Presumably, Madame Malkin would not mind being deported on a moment's notice (along with family and relatives) to a camp in some isolated, God-forsaken wasteland should Filipino-Americans come under suspicion.  If not, then this makes her a hypocrite on top of everything else.  But there's more.  While the Arab of popular stereotype is a villainous-looking fellow with a hooked nose, hooded eyes and an extremely swarthy skin, the truth is that Arabs can vary in appearance as much as Caucasians do.  (I went to high school with a Palestinian who had reddish hair and fair skin, not to mention an Arab-American in college who looked more like an Italian than anything else.)  So Madame Malkin's notion of separating the terrorist goats from innocent sheep fails on its own terms.  Speaking of Caucasians; as Malcolm X found to his surprise, there are any number of Muslims from central Asia who have blond hair, fair skins, and blue eyes.  There are indications that al-Qaeda is assisting Chechen separatists with terrorist attacks (including the latest massacre at a school in southern Russia).  What's to keep al-Qaeda (or similar groups) from employing suitable-looking terrorists here if we follow Malkin's advice to round up the usual suspects?<br /><br />Balancing civil liberties so as to protect American society (and American Muslims) while rooting out Islamists is going to be tough, especially in a conflict that has no definite end.  But if we do things Madame Malkin's way, then I suggest that the National Archives send her the original U.S Constitution and Bill of Rights so she can run them through her shredder.the interior.

Shortly before suffering the stroke that would virtually end his career, H.L. Mencken estimated that he had written perhaps five million words over the preceding fifty years.  Given all this, not to mention everything written about him by others, any biographer faces a monumental task-not only absorbing all of this material, but distilling it into it's essence without sacrificing vital details.  Fortunately, Mr. Terry Teachout proves up to the job.  His experience as a journalist and music critic gives him valuable insight into Mencken's career and avocation of music that other biographers lack.<br /><br />This is probably the best biography for someone who has come upon Mencken's writing somewhere, either quoted or in full, and only knows him as a name but would like to learn more about him.  There is a great deal in the book that is new concerning Mencken's relations with the women in his life, chiefly his longtime lady friend, Marian Bloom, and his wife, Sarah Haardt.  Unlike some reviewers on this page, I do not think there is anything prurient here; rather, it serves as a view into a facet of Mencken's personality and character that has been long obscured.  Also fascinating are the details of the estrangement that set in between Mencken and his friend and co-editor (on both \\"The Smart Set\\" and \\"The American Mercury\\"), the drama critic George Jean Nathan.<br /><br />The book takes up the long-smoldering controversy over Mencken's ambivalent opinions of the Jews that burst forth afresh in 1989 after a volume of excerpts from his diary was published.  I do not wish to give a potential reader any preconceptions, so I will restrict myself to observing that Mr. Teachout strikes me as fair and specific in his consideration of the evidence, and just in the conclusion that he draws.<br /><br />Despite the foregoing, the book does have a few minor but annoying (at least to me) quirks.  Mr. Teachout is a bit too hard on one of Mencken's earliest books, \\"The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\\", first published in 1908 (with a second edition in 1913).  Despite some of Mencken's youthful misconceptions, his book turns out to be a remarkably good conspectus of some of Nietzsche's main concepts and ideas.  Considering that Mencken struggled through Nietzsche's collected works in the original German (Despite widespread misimpression to the contrary, Mencken was not especially fluent in German.), and had almost no prior studies to consult; I think it is something of a miracle that he gets as much right as he does.  He was certainly far closer to the mark than the stock caricature of Nietzsche-as-proto-Nazi that was the order of the day in Anglo-American philosophy and literary criticism until well into the 1960's.<br /><br />Also, Mr. Teachout is a tad too disapproving of Mencken's religious skepticism.  To be sure, paying obeisance to religion is now 'de rigeur' among many neo-conservative intellectuals these days, few of whom are actually religious themselves.  (Mr. Teachout's preface is dated only a few days before September 11, 2001.)  Mencken is too honest for this kind of thing.  Moreover, his skepticism is needed now more that ever, what with a U.S. president speaking of a \\"crusade\\" against the Muslim world, and the deputy director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency vouchsafing that he could spot \\"demonic presences\\" hovering over Muslim cities in reconnaissance satellite photographs(!).  (Let us hope that the personnel controlling nuclear missiles are a little less caught up in eschatological fantasies.)  These are just differences of opinion though; they do not really detract from what will probably be the standard account of Mencken's life and work for some time to come.first published in 1908 (with a second edition in 1913).

Bush	Books	3	26	38	N	N	Christians rushing to chain themselves to Caesar's chariot	There is something tragically wrong with this book.  I do not impugn the veracity or sincerity of either the author or his subject, but the idea that a person should vote for a candidate because he proclaims himself a Christian strikes me as a serious abuse of religion.<br /><br />Mr. Bush's successful struggle against alcoholism (a scourge in my own family) with the help of his new-found faith is not to be sneered at, nor is his devotion to his family; but this book seems to avoid the crux of the matter:  Is is truly better to be misruled by devout Christians rather than be tolerably governed by sinners?<br /><br />Despite some demurrers here and there, the author mostly reports Mr. Bush's own valuation of his actions without any probing questions of his own.  Christians from Saint Augustine to Reinhold Niebuhr have struggled with the intersection between Christianity and politics.  For all too many Christians today, there is no struggle--Mr. Bush is God's annointed, and there is only one Christian way to vote.  Since the author avoids searching questions, then I am compelled to ask some:<br /><br />--Does it manifest the sin of pride when a leader initiates war while ignoring warnings from most veteran military officers and area specialists that there is extreme risk, not only of being trapped in a bottomless morass, but also of multiplying enemies a thousandfold by driving ordinary folk throughout the Muslim world into the arms of fanatics.<br /><br />--And what of starting such a war under false pretenses?  Anyone reviewing the writings of many of the President's advisors will note that most of them advocated attacking Iraq long before joining the Bush administration.  In other words, the idea of lauching the war came first, the elaborately worked out justification (itself mistaken to say the least) later.<br /><br />--As Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush's policies have demonstrably harmed the least of our brethren.  The mentally-ill, the mentally retarded, the chronically ill and the aged have been seriously harmed by cutbacks in social services.  We're not talking about lazybones collecting a government check.  In spite of having an economy larger than most nations, Texas ranks at the bottom along with Mississipi in measures of deprivation, ranging from child mortality to the percentage of citizens living in extreme poverty.  As for the prison system, it can proudly stand comparison with Soviet labor camps for it's brutality.  Finally, \\"treatment\\" for the seriously mentally ill consists of jailing them--just as British used to do in London's Bedlam hundreds of years ago.  Do modern Christians think that mistreatment will drive out unclean spirits?  One would think so.<br /><br />On the national level, the complete bill for Mr. Bush's policies has yet to come due.

Update--I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Vice-President Dick Cheney's Chief of Staff, has been convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying under oath to obstruct a national security investigation.  One of the jurors (in an interview conducted after the trial ended) said that the jury believed Mr. Libby to be the \\"fall guy\\" for his superior.  If Mr. Cheney is fortunate, his ailing heart will suddenly give out before an investigation and possible trial.  If he is not, he may find himself occupying a cell next to Mr. Libby's.  \\"Time wounds all heels.\\"<br /><br />Original review--The following paragraph is excerpted from the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, signed into law by that notorious leftist, President Ronald Reagan:<br /><br /> \\"Whoever, having or having had authorized access to classified information that identifies a covert agent, intentionally discloses any information identifying such covert agent to any individual not authorized to receive classified information, knowing that the information disclosed so identifies such covert agent and that the United States is taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert agent's intelligence relationship to the United States, shall be fined under Title 18 (USC) or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\\"<br /><br /> Valerie Plame's cover was blown by leaks reportedly emanating from the office of Vice-President Dick Cheney. Now for my question: Why has there not been a Federal investigation of this, much less an indictment? Or is it one thing when the far-Left (e.g., Philip Agee) does this kind of thing, and quite another thing when some far-Right munchkin working for the Bush administration does it?<br /><br /> The next time a blowhard lumbers to their feet on a Fox Network infotainment program and piously declaims how the Bush administration can best protect the country, kindly remember this book and the administration's reaction to it. A late 19th century historian, commenting on the 'Know-Knothing' party of the 1840's wrote: \\"Anything more low, mean, and feculent, the manifold heavings of history has not cast up.\\"<br /><br /> Until now, that is.0's wrote: \\"Anything more low, mean, and feculent, the manifold heavings of history has not cast up.\\"      Until now, that is.	2004-08-05

It goes without saying that anyone writing honestly on these topics has to endure parrot cries of 'racism!', but then that was to be expected.<br /><br /> The most eye-opening part of the book (for me) was the chapter on the inner world of the illegal migrant. Few native-born Americans can conceive of the sort of poverty that impels anyone of industry and spirit to leave their home in Mexico. These folk, almost entirely mestizo or 'Indio', are considered dispensible by the ruling strata of Mexican society--themselves almost entirely descended from Europeans. (Amusingly, Professor Hanson mentions talking with Mexican officials who snicker about dumping their peasant bumpkins into the U.S., only to lapse into silence when Hanson points out that joke is on them--they are losing some of their most capable and hard-working citizens.) Upon arriving in the U.S., migrants are astounded not only at the money they can make, but at the fact that stylish clothes, indoor plumbing, appliances, vehicles, and electronic doodads are within the reach of all. But within a few years, the light begins to dawn: this is as far as they can go. Sooner or later, knees, back, and sheer physical stamina will begin to give out. If married and with school-aged children, then the migrant finds the world turning topsy-turvy. His children know more about the world they are living in than he does. His teenaged daughter, if her English skills are good, finds herself working in 'pink-collar' jobs that are easier and better paying than anything her parents can do. Their sons are at risk for all of the vices of American society, drugs and alcohol especially. Little wonder that the migrant finds himself in a winter of discontent.<br /><br /> While there are no easy or magic answers, I agree with Hanson that the continuing flow of migrants from Mexico (legal and otherwise) must be cut off. Otherwise it will be impossible to increase the wages and opportunities of those already here. It will also be difficult to make them fully participating members of American society instead of living in a weird twilight, neither U.S. citizens, nor Mexicans. Finally, the Mexican government will never be induced to spend money to bring the bulk of it's subjects up to a decent standard of living unless the United States stops serving as a &quot;safety valve&quot;.<br /><br /> An honest and intelligent national discussion of measured and effective policies--free from the usual falsehoods and evasions--had better start soon. Otherwise, if there is a successful terrorist attack in the U.S. with smuggled nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons (especially if they were smuggled in via Mexico), the result will be panic, instantly shutting U.S. borders tighter than a mouse's bunghole to everything and everyone going either way.

The rest, as they say, is commentary.<br />The book is a good basic introduction to the topic for readers who have outgrown their old faith, realize that they cannot go back (except at the cost of heaving their rationality and common sense overboard), and want a deeper philosophical grounding for their views.  I would especially recommend it to younger readers (around high-school age, say) whose childhood religious instruction was either mostly pro forma (like many of us) or who had no religious training at all. (Lucky them!  The residue of childhood socialization is a frequent sticking point for people who sense that their faith is no longer believable, but who balk at admitting as much to themselves.)  As for most of the rest--young and old alike--I certainly do not recommend they upset themselves by reading anything they are not yet ready for.<br />Needless to say, such a small book can hardly be said to be an exhaustive treatment. (What book could?)  The reading list at the back has some good books for those who wish to go further.  (I would have included Mencken's \\"Treatise on the Gods\\" for fun, but that's just me.)<br />The author deserves praise for swatting down (among other things) a favorite smear employed against atheists, agnostics, and even anyone entertaining doubts, no matter how blameless their lives.  This is the oft repeated cant that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were both atheist states.  In the first instance, this is wrong, and in the second, Professor Baggini makes that point that militant atheism can certainly have deadly consequences.  So can militant Christianity and militant Islam, just to start.  In fact, with the collapse of Soviet Communism, fanatical religion has now resumed it's customary place as the chief threat to human life and liberty.<br />To conclude, it is curious that (up to now at least) the reviews on this page that praise this book have been--like the book itself--reasonable and temperate, even if one disagrees with them.  On the other hand, the ones that criticize do not merely say the author is mistaken; they indulge in the sort of hysterical rhetoric one would usualy find under a revival tent.

I subscribed to Mr. Tyrrell's late magazine, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, back in the late 70's and '80's when it was still a magazine of ideas. Although Mr. Tyrrell's slavish aping of Mencken's writing style grew tiresome, and despite such jarring notes as constantly calling gays &quot;pederasts&quot; in his in-house column, it was on the whole an intelligent read. (Mencken disliked homosexuals, but it's a bit difficult to imagine him indulging such gross impulses in print.)<br />As the Clintons rose to the apex of conservative demonology though, the magazine became more like &quot;American Opinion&quot;, and Mr. Tyrrell finally managed to run it into the ground. (Some legal trouble about using 501(c)3 money improperly, I recall.)<br />Now here he is again, having learned nothing from hard experience. I have no brief to make for Mrs. Clinton; if she wanted to be President so badly, then she should have divorced her cad of a husband and run for office under her own name. Despite this effort to paint her with horns and a tail, I really do not see that she is any more venial, ambitious, or ideological than most pols. Indeed, she is less than some. (I have the scion of a not-especially distinguished Texas family in mind.)<br />But as Mr. Tyrrell surely knows, someone with an obsession has low sales resistance, and this book is squarely aimed at the fears, fantasies, and hates of the sort of oaf who finds the very idea of an intelligent professional woman anathema. Once conservatives found this group, they started cultivating them like dollar bill-bearing trees using inflammatory rhetoric in books, columns, talk radio, the Fox network--you name it. The humor of it is that they are the ones whose pay has stagnated and whose career prospects have dimmed the most due to conservative policies. Now their children are asked to fight a war while our president's wealthy friends are not even asked to pony up some of the money to pay for it.<br />Hey!; I think their finally waking up. Execrating the Clintons for the n th time is starting to lose it's effect. Mr. Tyrrell shouldn't worry; a wealthy conservative foundation will step in to buy up the numerous unsold copies to hand out at the next CPAC conference.

Looking over this book, I'm reminded of the ballroom scene in the 1967 movie, &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;.  Here, the doofy old professor and his hapless young assistant have infiltrated a fancy dress ball of the vampires--in a mirrored ballroom.  Bewigged and clad in 18th century garb like the rest; they continue dancing away, heedless of their reflections in the mirrors.  As the music and dancing grind to a halt and everyone glares at them, they finally notice what's wrong.  The professor's reaction is to start pirouetting again while edging towards an exit.  Then the two break into a run while the horde chases after them.<br />Given the timing of this preposterous book, Mr. Podhoretz must feel like the professor, as public confidence in our Fearless Leader fall faster than price of Enron stock.  The author must feel a certain kinship with George W. Bush, considering that they are both are sons of famous fathers, devoid of any other distinction.  Both have spent almost their entire adult lives in sinecure jobs without any real responsibility.  (Mr. Bush as an ornament on the boards of Harken Energy and the Texas Rangers baseball team; Mr. Podhoretz grinding out hackwork for first, Sun Myung Moon, and later, Rupert Murdoch.)<br />But I digress... Now this book would scarcely be worth a second glance except for Mr. Podhoretz's smelly little habit of imputing anti-Semitism to critics of Mr. Bush's splendid little war in Iraq.  I have no brief to make for critics such as Michael Lind, who I think is harsh--even unfair--in his criticism of the Sharon government and it's more frantic American boosters.  But there is an enormous and unbridgable gulf between offenses such as this, and openly expressed wishes that Israel be wiped off the map, or accusations that all Jews all over the world are conspiring with Israel to control governments everywhere.  Considering neoconservatives (Yes, Virginia; there really are such things!) rightly decry critics of affirmative action being painted as racists, one would think that they might be a bit more cautious not to smear others in like manner.  But flacking for George W. Bush evidently means abandoning all sense, decency, or dignity.<br />Perhaps if Mr. Bush wins reelection, Mr. Podhoretz can giggle at the thought that crime does indeed pay, but the long term result will be to make the phrase 'anti-Semitism' as debased as the word 'racism' has already become.  This is something genuine anti-Semites (and racists) will exult in.ve action being painted as racists, one would think that they might be a bit more cautious not to smear others in like manner.

The magazine, and the era ended soon after the death of its' editor Bob Mizer in 1993. There is not much to say about the pictures that other reviewers haven't said already. (Although it is sad to see the models metamorphose from clean cut, boys-next-door to dull-eyed, druggie/hustler types as the 1970's wore on.)<br />What really amazed me was the hard-hitting commentary by Mizer in issue after issue. A genuine libertarian, the intense public opprobrium towards homosexuals (the word &quot;gay&quot; wasn't yet in wide use) fazed him not at all. He insisted on his rights as an American citizen and insisted his readers do the same. His eloquent arguments against censorship carried the day in several court cases where various bluenoses sought to ban distribution of his magazine. He frequently had to contend with anthropoids from the LAPD vice squad who did everything possible to make things difficult for him. I marvel at the guys' self-possession and courage. Mixed in with the commentary are mordant and amusing photo captions regarding some of the models. Mr. Mizer was nobody's fool.<br />For those who can afford it, this is a marvelous historical document as well as a fun read. More proof that the gay community of today didn't just pop out of nowhere in 1969.	2003-03-22

Bush and the Southern Takeover of American Politics	Books	5	28	36	N	N	"The past isn't dead; it isn't even past."--William Faulkner	Cultural factors do not explain everything about the policies of the George W. Bush administration, but it is uncanny how the ways and mores of the Old South (crony capitalism, Protestant fundamentalism, a primitive extractive economy with a tiny oligarchy riding on the backs of an impoverished populace) shed light on otherwise incomprehensible follies.  Mr. Lind's thesis is plainly informed by the work of historians and cultural geographers such as David Hackett Fischer and Joel Garreau.  The genius of his book lies in the author's ability to use this background to help explain the here-and-now.<br />For example, how is it that the Republican Party-once the stronghold of Taft/Eisenhower-style fiscal discipline-now thumps wholeheartedly for \\"supply-side\\" quackery that may end up making the U.S. economy as debt-ridden and broken-down as Argentina's?  The answer is that with the \\"southernization\\" of the GOP, Old South habits of wildcat financial schemes and scams are back in vogue again.  (Even supposedly wealthy southern planters usually barely staved off bankruptcy by borrowing year after year against crop liens on tobacco or cotton.)  This carefree approach to debt has the added attraction for some supporters of hamstringing government so that it is unable to perform pesky functions such as civil rights law enforcement or occupational safety and health inspections.<br />Equally striking is the disproportionately strong influence in first the Texas, and then the federal government of Protestant fundamentalism, especially its' apocalyptic and authoritarian strains.  Oddly enough, while agitating against the menace of evolution or the Teletubbies, our modern Pharisees seem blind to the weakest in our society judging from the snake-pit conditions in the Texas state mental health system.  (Along with Mississippi's the worst in the nation.)  What Would Jesus Do?<br />However well-meaning he may be, for George W. Bush to continue in office for another term would probably shove the United States into the widespread poverty and social strife of such large, potentially rich and misruled countries as Russia, Nigeria, or Brazil.  Hopefully, this trenchant book will be the occasion for a widespread reappraisal of the man and his policies.y shove the United States into the widespread poverty and social strife of such large, potentially rich and misruled countries as Russia, Nigeria, or Brazil.

This book is very different and is written for the average citizen by a former U.S. Army officer, field geologist and civil engineer who built and field-tested the \\"expedient\\" shelters described within while still employed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.<br />These shelters can be put togeather within a few hours by ordinary, untrained men and women. (It is a good idea to take a weekend and practice building them.) They provide good protection during the weeks it may take for fallout to decay to negligible levels of radioactivity. (Expedient blast shelters, which also protect against the shockwave from a nearby explosion, are also discussed.)<br />The author is clear and thorough throughout, supplying checklists for supplies, equipment and materials; detailed building instructions and descriptions of the genuine (as opposed to fanciful) effects of nuclear weapons. There is also a valuable discussion of the purchase and use of potassium iodide compounds for protection of the thyroid gland from absorption of radioiodine. Finally, detailed plans and instructions are provided for the construction and use of a homemade fallout meter(!) to indicate radiation levels. (It is a lot more accurate than many of the over-priced, defective-or-uncalibrated war-surplus \\"Geiger counters\\" on the market!)<br />The 2001 edition contains a new chapter on the hazards of trans-Pacific fallout, which could drift eastward to the U.S. mainland from a nuclear conflict in Asia. (Such as India vs. Pakistan, or a North Korean nuclear attack on the South or Japan.)  There is also a new appendix detailing the persuasive medical and scientific evidence that low levels of ionizing radiation below a certain threshold do no harm to humans or other forms of life, or their descendants.  In fact, it may make them healthier.  (Far from being crackpot, this concept is known in Biology as \\"hormeisis\\" and is dicussed in a recent article in DISCOVER magazine; see \\"Is Radiation Good for You?\\", DISCOVER Vol. 23 No. 12, December 2002.)  This should help to dispel the superstition that radiation is some sort of magic poison, and that any amount is deadly.<br />Anyone not living in a fool's paradise realizes that the chance of a nuclear detonation in an American city is probably higher now than it ever was when the United States and Soviet Union were locked in mutual standoff. Nuclear deterrance may have worked even on hardened Soviet or Chinese apparatchiks; but to to depend on it alone now against psychopaths and apocalyptic fanatics is to invite hideous disaster.s.

It is less useful for anxious laypeople (including me!) because it presupposes detailed knowledge of (and presumably practice in) decontamination procedures, using specialized personal protective gear, and emergency medicine. At the very least, I recommend having a medical dictionary on hand as you read and noting definitions of unfamiliar terms on the page margins. Taking a comprehensive first-aid course would also be a good idea.<br />This book serves it's purpose admirably, but it is not the chem/bio equivalent of Cresson Kearny's \\"Nuclear War Survival Skills\\". I suggest that the publisher produce a civilian manual along the lines of Kearny's classic civil defense guide.	2002-12-06

Mencken is on his best behavior here, but his characteristic flash and dazzle light up the book. As \\"The American Language\\", reflects Mencken's enduring interest in words, so this book reflects his fascination for religion in all it's varieties from high-toned to gaudy. While innumerable histories of religion have appeared before and since, probably none are so gracefully written and engaging. Even the pious will enjoy it.

Besides reprinting hard-to-find shorter items such as Shelley's essay \\"A Refutation of Deism\\", the editor has skillfully excerpted passages from longer works. Each selection is introduced by a brief essay providing biographical information about its' author, and a deft summary of the ideas expressed. Besides the necessary inclusion of representative works from Greek and Roman Epicurians, 18th century 'philosophes', and such philosophers as Hume, Nietzsche, Russell, and Sartre; the editor also adds works from now-obscure but important early figures such as Anthony Collins and Elihu Palmer.<br /><br />My only disappointment was the absence of Antony Flew's famous (and much anthologized) essay, \\"Theology and Falsification\\", but this is only a cavil. There is always room for one more custard pie, as Orwell wrote. Oh, and it would be nice if this book were printed instead of photocopied.	2002-08-07

While most have their good points, this one stands out for its clarity, unforced feel, and the sheer beauty of its poetry. (It doesn't hurt that it is reasonably priced!) In this Lucretius, the poet and philosopher are inextricably mixed and cannot be put asunder.<br />The naturalistic view of a beautiful but cold, and unfeeling universe is limned brilliantly and passionately. The gods appear, but only as a literary conceit, or as a faint concession to the possibility of higher realms of being. We are left \\"all alone\\", but not \\"all afraid\\". The light of understanding banishes dark terrors: Nothing; no horrors await us in death. Our lives here remain what we make them. Far from leading to nihilism and despair, this knowledge renews our sense of purpose. Play your part well; there is no second act.<br />I can only hint at the excitement that awaits the interested reader within these pages.

His observations and insights into the past and present of several U.S. and foreign cities are--as usual--dead on.  The chapter on the transformation of Paris from fetid medieval antheap to 'City of Light' in the 19th century by Baron Haussmann and his patron, Louis Napoleon is the best short account I've seen.  To read it is to see the falsity of the legend depicting the Emperor as a vain and gullible dolt.<br />That characterization better fits many of our own citizens today, to judge from the author's chapter about the Atlanta metro area.  (Houston would have served just as well, believe me.)  His accounts of two-fisted boodlers (journalist/editor Thomas Frank's phrase) plowing up and paving over everything in sight (in vain, it turns out--traffic congestion just gets worse), local government hacks refusing to enforce such weak regulations as exist, and the mentally apathetic and physically obese boobs--uh, citizens--who imagine all this is for the best in the best of all possible worlds--all of this is rendered like a Daumier drawing in words.<br />No one sane expects American cities to duplicate the look and layout of European ones (which have a much higher population density on average). But with imported petroleum now running over fifty percent of total annual U.S. consumption, even the most slack-jawed watcher of TV news from the Mideast should realize how precarious and unsustainable current land use and transportation patterns are.  Even if they are not sitting in traffic on I-75 for three hours every day behind the wheel of an armor-plated SUV.<br />Kunstler is no harsher in his appraisal of the American scene than was Lewis Mumford forty years ago in \\"The City in History\\".  But we're supposed to have learned something since then.  That we haven't seems due to a)  the propensity--more marked now than ever--of the American public to act like spoiled children who learn nothing, even from hard experience; and b)  the fact that corporate PR (i.e., everything from advertising to think-tank talking heads) fights good sense--even the evidence of one's senses--tooth and nail.  If Kunstler's sarcasm can help sting certain bovine/impotent portions of the citizenry into cerebral activity, then perhaps this is a favor to thank him for instead of an injury to nurse.then.

He loved Big Brother"	This book attempts to sugar over harsh Vatican pronouncements about gays and lesbians with glib and disingenuous language. Would-be readers are best off consulting the original documents, salted as they are with such disparaging phrases as \\"intrinsically disordered\\", and \\"objectively evil\\".<br />The author's account of his anti-gay epiphany while reading the anti-nazi German Protestant pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer has an incredible ring to it. Bonhoeffer courageously fought Nazi anti-Semitism from the beginning. (The record of the Catholic Church in this matter is mixed, to put it charitably.) Nor did he urge Jews to submit to ill treatment with resignation and quietude. By contrast, the book recycles boilerplate from Rome, to the effect that discrimination and violence against gays and lesbians would not arise if only they would obligingly stay closeted. It is cheap grace to pander to base prejudice this way, and worse to do so in a tone of chirpy sanctimony.<br />In sum, this book caters to conservative nostalgia for the era of the closet. It is difficult to see it as being of any value to a gay man or lesbian not utterly abject.	2002-01-23
