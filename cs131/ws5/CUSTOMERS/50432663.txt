You see the book is not overly long, and of course plays fast and loose with the HG welles story and the superman story, but it blends them very well, the story is set in the 30's and even has a more throwback feel to the art. <br /> <br />the story is mostly fighting but there is a lot of epic stuff going on and a fan of either will smile as you see how they blend this or that together, like for example the narration at the beginning is really well blended to tell both the superman and WOTW story with both having come from the respective books, very nice. <br /> <br />I love alternate stories because there is much to be done in the \\"what if?\\" setting, I wish the book had been longer since it feels rushed along, but for the price you can't be bothered too much, it's less than $6, so if you like either then get this book.	2005-08-22

I grew up reading the byrne F4, it was one of the grandest reads, it was epic but he kept it down to earth by makign the connection with the characters. <br /> <br />unlike many superhero teams such as the JLA or avengers the F4 are not a team at all, they are a family, it's what makes the book so great, your seeing a family cope with all these problems..sure the problems are alien invaders and such but it works! <br /> <br />Byrne has lost his art and writing talent in recent years, some people may be scared off by that, so if you read his recent JLA tenth circle or spider-man year one don't worry, this was back when he was the best man around, he was writing the best superman, F4, and co-writing x-men among others, it was like he could do no wrong, he understood what made them tick.  <br /> <br />also this book is great for kids and adults, i would give this to a kid just was my father gave me the byrne issues so long ago, now reading the issues again i see there is much more there to enjoy like bens struggle with being a monster, reeds struggle with having caused it...and much more. <br /> <br />also you should buy the first volume since it sets up characters for this volume and they have more impact when read together but this can be read alone and enjoyed greatly if you only get this one.	2004-08-17

Ok years ago I had never heard of fantastic four, my father brings home a comic for me and it was trial of Galactus, it was an amazing read and hooked me on the F4, well for years i could never get any of the issues of Byrnes other than the trade, now marvel comes out with this collection that is i hope one of many. <br /> <br />it's amazing as i read it i can see the little set up he was making, i'm sure at the time it may not have seemed as epic as F4 liked but when the puzzle falls into place it's  amazing. <br /> <br />Byrne has lost his art and writing talent in recent years, some people may be scared off by that, so if you read his recent JLA tenth circle or spider-man year one don't worry, this was back when he was the best man around, he was writing the best superman, F4, and co-writing x-men among others, it was like he could do no wrong, he understood what made them tick. <br /> <br />they are a family and they are not crime fighters liek a batman who patrols the city, they are explorers and that is what is great, we get great sci-fi stories of living planets and aliens aplenty. <br /> <br />if you have never read the F4 then this is the perfect place to start, then pick up the second volume to see where the set up goes and fine more wonderful stories. <br /> <br />also this book is great for kids and adults, i would give this to a kid just was my father gave me the byrne issues so long ago, now reading the issues again i see there is much more there to enjoy like bens struggle with being a monster, reeds struggle with having caused it...and much more.	2004-08-03

Ok first of all you do not need to know any history from DC comics to enjoy this book, it reads great as just a WW2 spt adventure, it is an elseworlds (a alternate reality story, a &quot;what if&quot;).<br />we see batman and more as more realistic, they don't even use their real names in most cases, like Batman is called the Bat, Houseman is called the clock.<br />if you love the heroes then you will love to see a fun new adventure in a alternate world, if you have no idea about them you still get a lot of fun and only miss out on a few little names or events, nothing that hurts the story though for new readers.<br />i can't say much about the story since it has so many great twists and i would hate to ruin it, but trust me it's worth every penny, and the price for this big a book is not bad.	2004-04-07

Kelly is one of the worst writers ever to write for the JLA, I have been reading the JLA for a very long time, i have also read many of the early issues thanks to the many trades so i know a little about them.<br />now the story is overly confusing, I love a cplex story bit i hate stories that think being extra confusing for the sake of being confusing makes them great.<br />we also have a lot of back and forth between the teams, never any real use of the new team that replaced the old JLA, and i think it would be a lot better if the focus had been on the replacments and been their story.<br />the story after you get past everythign else is only average at best, and with the rest of the problems it's just not worth the money with so many other great JLA or JSA trades out right now.<br />Also another beef i have with it is the character raven, he joins the team for stories that show up in future trades is a stereotyped character (who was based on the old superfriends TV show Apache Cheif who is also badly stereotyped, they just give him a new name but the writer admits he was based on him), though it does not happen in this issue we see him walk in casinos and do his native american tears act they love to write, i am native american and i find it insulting.<br />would it have been so bad to create a native american character who was not always a shaman or warrior brave who does his little native act? well Kelly can't it seems.<br />so stay away from any kelly JLA comics, trust me a long time JLA fan.	2004-03-02

Now first i would like to say i am not some patriot whowill bash anything said bad about my country, and i find you must always keep an eye on the government..now on to the review.<br />This story was just horrible in many way, we have captain america more as an icon than a man, we don't see steve rogers the man like we once did but just the image and that can be very boring.<br />the story is very one sided in how it says america is at fault for so much, terrorists attack a town that makes weapons, he rants about how america has down so so much harm, a woman looks at her husband and is upset to find he makes weapons at the local plant, like she did not know? or that makes him bad for finding a job?<br />where is the rebuttle? we see it's all one sided, all i ask is maybe cap or some one speak back and make their case..but no the message is clear in the comic.<br />so we get a boring story that tries to shove in our face how america is so badand we shoudl all hang our heads in shame? sorry but this is not my kind of story.<br />i don't want a overly patriotic cap  but i don't like this extreme either.<br />but the art is stunning, i just wish the story could be as good.	2004-02-25

The story is about Savitar who is  in his own mind the God of speed, and when he finds out others are using the speed from the speed force and so he cuts them off...All but wally west The Flash and thats when all hell breaks loose. This story has it all, lots of speedsters like the first flash and others and you have &quot;Speed Ninjas&quot; who work with Savitar so all in all you get a good story with lots of the &quot;Flash family&quot; in it. Also you have the death of a few speedsters as well so if your a flash fan you will not want to miss the story about that.<br />My one problem with the book is that it has a cliffhanger ending! trades should never leave the ending open like that because you buy a trade for the complete story not cliffhangers. but DC comics have published the second book &quot;Race againist time&quot; so you might want ot pick it up at the same time if you want the whole story.	2001-07-08

Yeah i love this book and Flash is my favorite hero of the DC heroes (better then supes even). This book tells the story of two very different heroes Hal &quot;Green lantern&quot; Jordan and Barry &quot;The Flash&quot; Allen and how even though they don;t seem to have anything in common other then being heroes are the best friends in the DC Universe. This reprints all six issues of the Brave and the bold mini series that made new &quot;old stories&quot;, Since both are dead now this is the only new stories we will see. If you are a fan of either or just love a good story then get this book because it is one of the best only i wish it was longer then six issues in fact i could read an ongoing series like it!<br />(Also this has guests like Green Arrow, Kid Flash, The Original GL and Flash and others.)<br />a story of two buddies.	2001-07-08
