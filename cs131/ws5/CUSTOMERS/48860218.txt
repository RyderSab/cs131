The mythology of Egypt can be fun, but the history is what really draws your attention. A clear part of Egyptian history is her pharaohs, and this book follows the line of ancient pharaohs with adequately-sized sections for each.<br /><br />If you are looking for specific details this might not be very helpful, but it is very good for reading about the bigger stories.<br /><br />This is a great book to help start young readers on their road to learning about Ancient Egypt.<br /><br />A 'must have' for any Egypt-history-lover!	2005-08-23

It has all the basics, where you learn about the more important gods and their stories.<br /><br />There isn't much violence in the book, because this is to tell the stories, not the epic battle sequences, but that doesn't mean only younger audiences can enjoy it.

Or where the word 'O.K.' came from? Or a hundred other things about where words came from?<br /><br />This book can't hold all the answers, but it has a good collection. Janet Klausner has put everything in a way that makes it fun to read, and you learn quite a bit. You find out where names of animals and clothing came from, and the roots of bunches of words. Sometimes you learn some words you didn't know before.<br /><br />In addition to the history of English, you will also read about some basic history of different peoples and kings.<br /><br />I would say this book is good for all kids (9 and up), but for any curious adult who wants to find a few facts about English this is perfect.	2005-08-23

To prove himself right he steals the king's seal, and then goes to brag about it in a wineshop. Soon after he is caught and thrown in the dungeon and kept there until the Magus (Sounis's most trusted advisor) wants to use him to steal something. Along with the Magus, his apprentices Ambiades and Sophos, and the soldier Pol, Gen goes on an adventure over the mountains of Eddis to the kingdom of Attolia to steal something that is said to be a myth. The Magus treats Gen like a prized tool, Ambiades treats him like scum, but Gen still manages to add wit to his story that will have you laughing out loud.<br />The book is good enough to read again and again, but the best time is the first time, because of the ending. You probably will never see it coming, and when all is revealed, it seems like the most clever book in the world.<br /><br />There is some minor language, but otherwise this book is good for all ages over 8.<br />Once you read it, don't forget to read the sequel, the Queen of Attolia, which is more for older audiences because it's of a little darker and serious tone.<br />My sisters and I all are avid readers of fantasy, and we have all agreed that The Thief is one of the best books in the world, likely even the best.<br />Don't sit around waiting for Harry Potter 7 twiddling your thumbs (2 years of that would put a strain on your hands); read The Thief!	2005-07-31

War, rule, treachery, diplomacy, despair, and hope.<br /><br />Two kingdoms, Sounis and Attolia, stand on the sides of the mountain kingdom of Eddis. Across the sea lie the ambitious Medes, wanting to end up with those three kingdoms with as little effort as possible.<br /><br />Sounis no longer has a hold over Eddis (read 'The Thief') to entice the queen to marry him, and the king is anxious to control her kingdom by other means if necessary. Attolia is a tiger ready to pounce, waiting for her chance.<br /><br />All events are set in motion when Eddis sends her Thief, Eugenides, to spy on Attolia in her own capital. One time too many, and Attolia finally gets her hands on the thief who has eluded her grasp so many times before. She doesn't hang him, but sends him back to Eddis maimed for life.<br /><br />A one-handed thief isn't use to anyone; that is the way Eugenides feels. Locking himself in his room, he shuns the world around him and ignores the clues to the trouble his kingdom faces that would eventually pull him out of his stupor:<br /><br />Eddis is furious at what Attolia has done to her cousin, and as retaliation the two kingdoms go to war. Sounis seizes his chance and allies himself with Attolia, Attolia brings in the aid of the Mede and their crafty (and charming) ambassador, and Eddis's only hope lies in the Thief.<br /><br />Quote: \\"Steal peace, Eugenides. Steal me some time.\\"<br /><br />Eugenides is growing from a boy to a man, but his wit still remains. The twists and turns and smooth curves will delight you, and you will cry and laugh with the clever Thief.<br /><br />The political intrigue will keep you on your toes, the characters will engross you: it will be hard to put the book down, and once you do you are anxious to pick it back up.<br /><br />A delightful story in whole, but even once you know the ending you will be able to read the book again (and again) for the beauty of each individual part.eauty of each individual part.	2005-07-31

So he has to deliver this message to this council of people, blah blah blah.<br /><br />So perhaps it's an all right story.<br /><br />But he - Thomas Covenant - is an annoying person, who doesn't care about anyone or anything, is an unfeeling pest, and I didn't like him.<br /><br />The story went slow, grr, and I gave up. Perhaps Covenant undergoes some miraculous change of character, resulting in a great story, but I didn't want to have to get to that point (if it exists).<br /><br />Edit some time later:<br />I originally rated the book 2 stars because I felt bad, having read under 100 pages... but in order to honestly express my feelings, a change to 1 star is appropriate. Even now, 6 years later, I can only think of the book with revulsion.<br />(Note, it probably helps to actually know he's supposed to be an anti-hero. I had no idea. Picked it up at a library sale and naively thought it had promise because it was fantasy and had sequels.)	2005-04-13

His father keeps him on an island in this different plane, so no one is aware of his existence.<br /><br />But when his father dies, Timothy goes into the care of his father's friend, Leander, a member of the order his father was part of. Leander likes the boy immediately, but doesn't think it's right to keep him away from the world. So he bring him out to join the world of magic.<br /><br />But Timothy, who is an inventor, turns out to be more of a threat to the magical world than he would have thought. Timothy has no magic - but magic has no hold on him.<br /><br />An interesting story, yes, but that is all. It was very poorly written. All the characters talk the exact same way, and all act the same - except for Nicademus, the head of the order of the Alahazad (~), the order in which Timothy has now joined. This man has a little different attitude. But otherwise, the characters seem the same.<br /><br />And Timothy, called a 'brilliant' boy throughout the book, aside from inventing things, doesn't seem very brilliant.<br /><br />I found the characters rather hollow, and it was hard to enjoy reading this book.<br /><br />Still, it's not a very long book, and the story does have many interesting ideas.	2005-04-13

But Cain doesn't only want the money; he wants to create a name for himself. By killing Santiago, he would be remembered.<br /><br />He meets up with some strange characters along his way:<br /><br />Virtue McKenzie, the 'Virgin Queen', a reporter who desperately wants an interview... with Santiago;<br /><br />The Jolly Swagman, art collector, who is looking for several pieces of art currently possessed... by Santiago;<br /><br />The Angel, the most famous bounty hunter, cold, deadly, and never failing, who wants money... from killing Santiago;<br /><br />Moonripple, a nice girl who likes to work as a waitress, and thinks the greatest hero in the universe... is Santiago.<br /><br />Clue after clue, name after name, lead after lead, Cain will follow the bread-crumbs that could lead him to Santiago. But as he nears his goal, he doesn't know if he will ever kill Santiago... but he's not sure of the reason why....<br /><br />A satisfying read, that will have you brimming with excitement and even laughing at times, this is a 'must read' for anyone who likes science fiction.

The Hogfather is, of course, Father Christmas - except that he drives in a sleigh pulled by pigs, and gets sherry and turnips as snacks.<br /><br />But someone has hired the Assassins Guild to `get rid of' this certain somebody, and they get on the job.<br /><br />While the Hogfather faces the peril of being un-believed in (which is how a god `dies', though just as soon they can come back to `life'), Death takes up the reigns, puts on a fake wig, stuffs some pillows under his coat, and becomes the substitute Hogfather. Eating the sherry and turnips (or leaving the turnips and letting his assistant Albert drink the sherry), leaving toys in the stockings, and making sure there are plenty of coal-prints on the carpet, Death hopes to keep the belief of the Hogfather alive.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mr. Teatime (that's `teh-ah-tim-eh' to you), the hired Assassin, has hired a few thugs to help him with his work. They are having a hard time getting used to this odd, one-eyed (one glass eye), eccentric assassin.<br /><br />And Susan - the daughter of Death's adopted daughter and his former apprentice (thus Death's granddaughter) - knows something's wrong; when Death instead of the Hogfather comes in and fills the kid's stockings. She is trying to lead a `normal' life as a governess; though when your hair rearranges itself, you can walk through walls, can see bogeymen, and talk in capital letters like Death, it's hard to be normal.<br /><br />So Susan, along with the 'oh god' of Hangovers (who she runs into), goes to find out what has happened to the Hogfather - and see if she can return Hogwatch to what it was before, with the correct Hogfather.<br /><br />Along with 'Interesting Times', and 'Small Gods', this makes it to the top 5 of all the Discworld novels.	2005-02-14

Then, hey, I read this book, and boom! Ok, so they still need work, but this book made me understand how to keep characters exotic, good, and believable.<br /><br />The first part of this book didn't interest me as much, because it was advising on how to make sure your characters are good on their background - of people who live in this world. This wasn't 'really' helpful for me, because I write fantasy in other worlds, but I picked up a few helpful things.<br /><br />Then came a section on Dialogue, which was good too - at the time I was reading it I didn't realize it, I thought it was a bit dull, but then I realized I had started taking the advice unconciously.<br /><br />But then came along the next part of the book, and I could hardly wait to pick it up each time. It explains greatly how to make sure your characters aren't hollow, and how they should respond in situations according to their attitudes and past life.<br /><br />This book I highly recommend to any author who feels his characters aren't to their full potential (or if they don't want to admit that, this book was fun to read as well).	2004-10-05

Wrede has written so many good books (Enchanted Forest Chronicles, Marileon the Magician, the Raven Ring, the Lyra Novels, and more), so I picked this book up a few days after having listened to a long lecture from my sister on how great it was. I looked at the cover, said, 'Nice cover,' and set it down to start later - which I did. I had hopes it would be good, I didn't doubt Patricia C. Wrede, but I didn't want my hopes to get to high and be disappointed. Well, it turns out I needn't have worried. This book is seriously the best book I've read all year (except perhaps the Harry Potter's, and the Witches of Eileanan's, both series are fantastic), and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />It's about these two (women) cousins, Cecelia and Kate, and the story takes place many years ago in Britain. Kate goes to London to be introduced to Society, but Cecelia is in disgrace because of a goat incident (which it never fully explains). The whole story is in letters from one cousin to the other, and they discuss social events, politics, fashions, family, and... wizards.<br /><br />One very interesting thing about this book is the way it was written. The two authors, Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer, played the 'Letter Game' - they sent real letters to each other, pretending to be their character. They never discussed the plot (well, once, a tiny), though they did discuss the characters, and then at the end of (I think) 6 months, they looked at the letters together and decided to make a book.<br /><br />It's a very hilarious book, with a great plot and wonderful characters, and anyone who likes fantasy - or even Jane Austen - will enjoy this book; unless you like battles with guns or swords, because this book doesn't have that. Otherwise, it is certainly worth it to get this book.	2004-10-05

You also are sad at some places, but that's good - if you aren't sad, then you haven't connected with the characters enough, and the writer isn't doing his job. In this book you understand the characters, you get to know them in a few pages, and it's great.<br /><br />This story is set in 'Ancient China', but not any China that's ever been anywhere except in imagination. It has myths and other things in it that you may have encountered before.<br /><br />It starts when a pair of annoying people accidentally poison all the children of their village, and one young man (the main character, Number-Ten-Ox) goes to find someone who knows the cure for them. He finds Master Li, who has a slight flaw in his character, and they figure out they must find the Root of Power to cure the children. They then embark upon a magical and hilarious journey, where they meet new characters (friends and foes alike) and pick up pieces to a puzzle that takes until the end to complete (as is right).<br /><br />If you like bizarre fantasy novels, this is for you.

I, for one, know that there are a lot of computer hoaxes sent along e-mail 'trains' that I've gotten and just laughed at.

The student bought a bunch of turtles, each slightly larger than the other, then each day took a hook, pulled out the turtle in the tank, and replaced it with a bigger one. And then he reversed it and started putting smaller ones.<br /><br />Have you ever heard about Charles Ponzi? You should have. He told people that if they gave him money, he would give them twice that back. People were, of course, flocking to do this after the first few people got twice their money back. But it was soon figured out that he only gave them the money back because he had an ever-lasting line of people willing to give him large amounts of money. When this happened, people stopped and this caused Ponzi's whole scheme to go wrong and he spent five years in jail. This type of hoax has since then been known as the Ponzi hoax.<br /><br />You also get to read about the Cottingley Fairies; two cousins cut out drawings of fairies from a book, placed them with hat pins, and then took pictures of them and told the world that faeries were real.<br /><br />So all in all, this book has many funny and facinating hoaxes and is well worth getting and reading.Fairies; two cousins cut out drawings of fairies from a book, placed them with hat pins, and then took pictures of them and told the world that faeries were real. <br /> <br />So all in all, this book has many funny and facinating hoaxes and is well worth getting and reading.	2004-07-26

My sister is even reading it, and she 'never' reads books I recommend. It's so interesting - this author, besides these books, only writes Star Wars books, which is really sad (for me), but that's OK.<br />These books are really good. They are fantasy.<br />The Fey are a war people who are also magic people - well, most of them. There are some Fey called Red Caps, who don't have magic (thus are short), and they are considered servants pretty much among the Fey. The Fey are tall, dark-skinned people, who are very proud, brave, and intent on conquering the world. The leading force of all the Fey is what is called the Black Throne. It's a line of kings and queens who have what is called Black Blood. And usually the heir is the oldest child of the throne, because killing among Blood is not good - for anybody. It causes what is called the Blood, where everyone turns on people. It happened once, and only a tenth of the Fey survived. They weren't a very large force then, and (around) 3000 people died. Now they rule half the world -  preventing causing the Blood is on the mind of every Fey.<br />That's just killing them outright - if you send an assassin, that counts. But if you perhaps send him somewhere to fight when you know he'll lose and he dies - hey, it's not your fault. Which is what the Black King did.<br />His name is Rugad, and he sent his son to a place called the Blue Isle. He didn't think his son was worthy of the throne. But what he didn't want was his granddaughter, Jewel, going with him. Her brothers were absolutely not going to become the next rulers (Fey live a long time).<br />This is the Fey, who want to take over the world. They would probably have succeeded, with their Beast Riders, Dreamriders, Infantry, Domestics, Wisps, Echanters, and Spell Warders. Except for the Blue Isle. Rugad's son, Rugar, did get defeated. But to an extent Rugad didn't expect. The Islanders (as they are called) have a strange magic, that most of them don't know they have. Among them is a hidden place, a place of magic. And they are the most formidable force the Fey will ever encounter, with their Poison (Holy Water) and other religious relics.<br />I won't tell you any more, because - who knows? - you might read this series. And I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.<br />This series covers all things - religion, war, prejudices, love, mystery, and the true meaning (and wrong meanings) of family ties.

It's very interesting, and has many different things it tells about - from Hunting Crocodiles in Egypt, to Medical Experiments at Dachau (Germany), to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (USA), to The Home Front: A Child's View, Sheffield. Of all my years of reading history books, this one has been the most educational and informative. Also, some things have influenced and touched me greatly. One example:<br />Christmas in the Trenches, Western Front, 1914:::  The enemies shared beer and greetings, and not a bullet was shot that day. It is nice to know that even war people can be good and celebrate.<br />While reading this book, I have learned that there is no end to human behavior. Cruelty and kindness, trust and betrayal, love and hate - it's all here in this book, and I have been greatly changed by it.<br />Though not a history fan myself, I encourage everybody to read this book:<br />It, with no doubt, is a great treasure to the world.	2003-10-14

If you have not read the Chronicles (Dragons of; autumn twighlight, winter night, and spring dawning) but want to, my review tell some things one might not want to know.<br />This takes place (at the starting) about two years after the War of the Lance.<br />This is about the Majere twins, Raistlin the wizard, and Caramon the fighter. After the War of the Lance (dragons of; autumn twilight, winter night, and spring dawning), Raistlin started wearing the black robes. His brother isn't to pleased with that, but his love for his brother is strong. Now Raistlin lives in a tower of High Sorcery, he became the 'master of past and present' - the requirement to enter the tower, and even the grove around it. Raistlin was always one of my favorite characters, even though he is not very nice. I think what I most like about him, is that he is evil, but he doesn't work with the evil side.<br />Anyway, Caramon is now married to Tika, and they live in Solace. But Caramon has sort of fallen into depression, and isnt... himself. He has become, for the most part, a drunk - which is terribly unlike him.<br />As for the other hero?s of the lance; Goldmoon and Riverwind (the plainsmen) have three children and live happily. Tanis (half-elven) and Loranna (the elf) are married. Tasseloff (the kender) is still wandering. Flint, the dwarf, died in Dragons of Spring Dawning, and it is believed he is happy, sitting under a tree. Kitiara (does she count as a hero of the lance?) is still a dragon Highlord. Sturm died as well, during the war.<br />Tanis arrives at the Inn of the Last Home with Crysania, a cleric of Paladine. She is going to the tower of high sorcery to see Raistlin. Tanis was supposed to take her there, but he needs to go to Qualinesti for the funeral of the Speaker of Suns. So Crysania goes on her own. Tika then sends Caramon after her, and with him goes Tasseloff, and the gully dwarf Bopo.<br />When they arrive at the tower, they find out what Raistlin is after, and Caramon and Crysania are sent by Par-Salin back in time (Raistlin has already gone) to right before the Cataclysm. Tasseloff stays. Or - he was supposed to. You see, kender are one of the races that were not supposed to be, so it was thought that if one was to go back in time, they could change the past. Will he?<br />All in all, I like this book (one might guess - I rated it 5 stars). It's a bit dark, but Tasseloff (like always) brightens it up a little, and made me laugh a few times.and Crysania are sent by Par-Salin back in time (Raistlin has already gone) to right before the Cataclysm.

I rate most books 4 stars, with an exceptional few getting 5 stars.<br />This was about a kender, Tas (again), who stole a bracelet from a dwarf. Oh, Tas's excuse was that Flint had just left the bracelet 'laying around' so Tas was inclined to pick it up and keep it in his care until he saw the dwarf. Anyway, Flint gets the bracelet back, but then the two of them and Tanis half-elven go to the Inn of the Last Home to have a drink, and when the Dwarf and elf leave, Tas finds out that the bracelet just 'happened' to 'fall' into his pocket. He then goes to sleep, and in the morning remembers nothing about the bracelet. He leaves town, and when he's miles away, puts the bracelet on. He then finds it shows the future. Bad things, that is. Tas saves a man from hobgoblins, and then gives the bracelet to him to return to Flint, for the man was going in that direction. Tas then goes on. The farmer, in town, gets robbed, the bracelet included. Then the woman who had Flint make the bracelet comes up and wants her bracelet, and Flint is forced to tell the whole embarrassing story. And then they have to go on a journey; just a little one, to solve a few mysteries, save a squire, castle, and almost the world- nothing much.	2003-02-13

On the street Harvey meets a man who tells him that he could go with him to a place where Harvey would never again be bored. Harvey follows him. Indeed, the place, Hood House, is a place where Harvey is never bored. He calls his parents, and they tell him to stay as long as he wants, saying they had arranged for it. Harvey is not suspicious, and takes the wonders of the house without question; every morning is spring, every noon is summer, every evening is fall, with Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas every day - it's all he ever could have asked for.

Furniture is flying around (more like a flying squirrel flies, really), undead are not that rare, and a stash of little glass globe-things are appearing - the kind that you shake with the snow and they have the city of Ankh-Morpork as the figure inside.<br /><br />And then, carts start appearing. Useful; until they run away with your things in them.<br /><br />While there are some of the funny elements that make the Discworld series so fun, it lacks somewhat in that area and the story area.

Of all of these, my favorite was the second book, 'The Dark is rising' which I would rate 5 stars.<br />Of the whole series:<br />It was a good story, a good plot, and a pretty good ending, considering. It was a story about good and evil, the Light and the Dark, fighting each other. There were five magical items that needed to be collected, and, basically, which ever side got all of them won. The five items were; the Grail, the belt of Signs, a parchment, the harp of gold, and a the crystal Sword.<br />There is a poem in it which I likes a lot, and I memorized it. It tells some of the story in itself:<br />  \\"When the dark comes rising, six shall turn it back;<br />  Three from the circle, three from the track'<br />  Wood, bronze, iron; water fire stone;<br />  Five shall return, and one shall go alone.\\"<br />  \\"Iron for the birthday; bronze carried long;<br />  Wood from the burning; stone out of song;<br />  Fire from the candle-ring; water out of thaw;<br />  Six signs the Circle; the Grail gone before.\\"<br />  \\"Fire in the mountains, shall find the harp of gold;<br />  Played to wake the Sleepers, oldest of the old;<br />  Power from the Greenwitch, lost beneath the sea;<br />  All shall find the Light at last, silver on the tree.\\"<br />All in all, this series really got my attention. At first I wan't very enthusiastic about it, but now that I've read it, I look back and wonder; why didn't I think I would like it?<br />The only thing that wasn't all that good was the ending. I suppose their aren't many other ways it could have ended, though.	2002-12-13

They are the most powerful beings on the Discworld, even equal with the Gods. A sourcerer happens by a wizard having eight children. Then the eighth one has eight children, and then his eighth child is a sorcerer. Sourcerers aren't generally good news.<br /><br />This time what had happened was that a wizard had eight sons. Ok, so that's fine. But then, his eighth son fled the University, married, and had eight sons. And the eighth son became a sourcerer.<br /><br />This sorcerer, Coin, was an infant when Death came for Ipslore, his father. Ipslore was supposed to go with Death, at least. Death was pretty annoyed when the man died and put his spirit inside the staff. And Ipslore got away with it, for Death could only take him if he destroyed the staff, but then that would destroy Coin, for the staff became his. And if Death destroyed Coin, then that would damage the whole fabric of time.<br /><br />So, one day, the wizards at the Unseen University were going to elect a Archchancellor, and Coin appeared, reduced the 'one who was about to be elected' to ashes, and demanded to be chosen himself. The wizards only protested for a little, until they found out what they could do once he showed them. Sourcerers are sources of magic. And so, all the wizards were able to do anything they wanted. Produce anything out of thin air, fly, etc. Which was not good for the city of Ankh-Morpork.<br /><br />Rincewind was a wizard. Or, he tried to be a wizard. He was not in the Unseen University at the time when Coin appeared. He was getting drunk (this was after he heard that a sourcerer was coming, from a gargoyle, all of which were off the walls and were leaving, and after he saw all the rats, bedbugs, and ants fleeing also), and talking with the Librarian, an orangutan who used to be human.<br /><br />Then a thief comes in and takes him away (after a few incidents), telling him that the Archchancellor's hat had spoken to her and made her steal it and find a wizard to put it on.

Cruella is around, but she is asleep and selling 'clothes that clank' with her husband, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the mysterious sleeping.<br />Pongo and Perdita `swoosh' (fly) over to london to meet with their daughter, Cadpig who belongs to the prime minister.<br />Cadpig seems to be the main character; she is the one who did almost not live at birth (in the Disney movie this is Lucky, but in the book Lucky is the one who has spots in the shape of a horseshoe).<br /><br />After many attempts to find out what is wrong, they solve the mystery and must face a decision that could change the nature of the very world.	2002-12-13
