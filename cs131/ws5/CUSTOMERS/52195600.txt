Yes, this book is almost entirely reprints of Coulter's columns, but don't despair!

Books	2	12	33	N	N	Lights Out	I've never been a huge fan of Norman Mailer--let's be frank, no one is a bigger fan of Norman Mailer than Norman Mailer--and this book did little to change that opinion. <BR>The first section of this book is exactly the kind of rhetorical meandering that gives intellectualism a bad name in some circles. Mailer spends so much time propping up his own semi-logical house of cards that he completely sidesteps the meat of the matter. Truth is lost in the dust. After a while, statements like \\"people who are wicked are always raising the ante without knowing quite what they're doing. Most of us are wicked to a good degree,\\" start to sound like the blathering of Hawkeye Pierce in a sub-standard MASH episode. <BR>Part II, a critical analysis of American foreign policy in the Middle East, Arabia and Persia following 9/11, is right on the mark, though Mailer's refusal to give even the slightest benefit of the doubt to the Bush administration overwhelms some of his better points; his relentless ridicule of religion and patriotism of all kinds is also daunting, unfair and unfounded. I have a hard time granting much credibility to a man who writes \\"We violate Christianity with every breath we take. Equally do the Muslims violate Islam. We are speaking of a war then between two essentially unbalanced and inauthentic theologies.\\" Mailer never hints at any argument to buttress this statement; it is simply stated as fact. To write off 60 percent of the world's population as spiritually irrelevant is bogus, to say the least. <BR>Perhaps most distressing is Mailer's increasing tendency to invoke an idealized past to support his arguments. Late in the book he complains that young children don't \\"read consecutively for an hour or two,\\" as he says they used to. Again, there is nothing factual to support the statement. Odder still are the bizarre causes Mailer claims led to the supposed problem: TV commercials (not TV shows, just the commercial interruptions) and--get this--fluorescent lights in classrooms. <BR>\\"What characterizes fluorescent light is that everybody looks 10 percent plainer than they do under incandescent bulbs...if everybody seems uglier than they are normally, why then, everyone naturally grows a little depressed.\\" <BR>Oh brother. <BR>One of my usual complaints about Mailer is the length of his books: endless. Not so with \\"Why Are We At War,\\" which I read cover to cover on my lunch hour. Eight bucks seems a little steep for 111 pages that appear to contain only a few more words than a NEW YORKER feature or a front page NY TIMES story with a jump.	2003-08-13

There is detail, and then there is minutia. Gray spends way too much time on the pre-Clash--and even the pre-musician--days of Clash bandmembers, and way too little time on the Clash itself. The book is 505 pages long and the first Clash LP isn't released until page 300.<br />There is plenty of interesting stuff, most of it falling somewhere between page 150 and page 300, which sheds some light on the musical background of Mick Jones (Glam) and Joe Strummer (Folk). All the stuff about the early teaming up of the Clash and the Sex Pistols was interesting. I would have liked to have known a bit more about how these guys learned to play and write--according to this book Topper Headon just sat down at a drum set and began playing great stuff--and a few more nuts & bolts type things would have been nice too.<br />The amazing thing about this book is that, at 500 pages, virtually all of it seems to have been culled from contemporary magazine storys/interviews/reviews. Gray is decent enough to credit his sources at every turn, but by constantly referring to those sources, Gray repeatedly reminds the reader that he was not given the opportunity to interview members of the band.<br />But the real shortcoming of the book is Gray's silly opinion that the Clash didn't meet the author's incredibly narrow definition of a Punk band. According to Gray, you could only qualify as a real Punk band if you were constantly abusive, cheered rioters, played to audiences of no more than a few hundred, refused to have your records released to large audiences, demonstrated a hatred of America, never did anything similar to anything else you'd ever done before, and never ever ever ever allowed evena trace of a musical influence to show through in your own music.<br />For Gray, after their first record, the Clash didn't meet his standards.<br />Call me jaded, but I think musicians want people to hear their music. I'm weird that way. And, at the time, Pete Townshend said, rightly, that the Pistol's \\"Pretty Vacant\\" was the best record of the year; he also said, rightly, that Punk was doomed if they were going to attempt (or pretend) that their music had no musical heritage whatsoever.<br />Finally, it's hard to read the endless recitations of Gray's definition of 'real Punk' when he so blithely ignores his own rules: \\"Last Gang In Town\\" was distributed by a big market publisher; a second, \\"sequel\\" edition was released; his style seems to be a misguided attempt at recreating Phillip Norman's fantastic book about the Beatles, \\"Shout!\\"; and--I actually find this kind of funny--Gray's photo on the dust jacket is a silly recreation of the cover photo from Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\"<br />Maybe I'm being petty. But I find it frustrating that there is no good book about one of the most interesting bands of the past 25 years; Marcus Gray had the chance and--hard as this is to say about such a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng book--he came up short. A ruthless editor would have made a great difference here.	2003-08-08

The whole book can be paraphrased as 'I, Bernard Goldberg, the only straight-thinking and non-biased journalist ever, spent many years telling my wild-eyed liberal bosses that they were evil and bent, but they were too stupid to recognize my obvious genius.'<br />Perhaps most discouraging, Goldberg mentions only in passing in the book's forward that nearly all talk radio, a growing number of cable networks and FOX News in its entirety are blatently and overtly conservative; he then spends the 234 pages whining about instances of vaguely perceived liberal bias on the big three networks--particularly the network that refused to make him evening news anchor, by the way--and concludes that Americans are being misled by the Left.<br />Hogwash.<br />Another favorite topic of the new edition is how those horrible liberals refused to interview Goldberg about the first run of BIAS. He even ridicules networks and programs that never talk about bestsellers, because they didn't make the exception for his oh-so-important tome. Paragraph after paragraph is devoted to the supposed shut-out until--finally--Goldberg gets around to mentioning that he DID get to hype his book on the TODAY show. But that's not good enough for him either: it was only \\"a dog and pony show.\\"<br />If you're looking for books about journalism and the problems you'll encounter in the business, look around. There are some good ones. <br />Skip BIAS, though. It is nothing more than the whining of a frustrated man who, to be perfectly blunt, is not quite as smart or nearly as unbiased as he obviously believes.	2003-05-09

I disagree.  I think both are pro-humanity books.  Heller and Vonnegut, like Voltaire centuries earlier, both seem to have reached a place when writing these classics where they could no longer stomach the absurdities of their day.  It wasn't just war that nauseated them; it was the ease--the eagerness--in which they saw men become animals.<br />They are, unfortunately, depressing books.  Great books, but depressing nonetheless.	2002-07-28

Like all good teachers--and all good writers, for that matter--King knows how to strip away the adverbs and the clutter, leaving a clean story and a clear idea.	2001-07-01

My only real complaint is that it has not been reissued with updated information, carrying the story of this politico-cult to it's current status as some kind of latter-day Hole In The Wall Gang in suburban Washington DC.	2001-06-20

Like virtually every other book I've ever read by or about a rocker (small 'r', not Rocker, with a big &quot;r', which a good Mod would still take as an insult, I'm sure), ALL THE RAGE is little more than a litany of boozy gigs, plane trips, dull hangovers, and bad business deals.	2001-06-10

My friend, Andru The Engineer, has written the be-all and end-all book on the moment that froze female hearts throughout the western world.  It wasn't enough that he married Linda Eastman; then it looked like he fell off the planet.<br />This is an exhaustive look at the phenom that swept AM radio and even took in some of the 'serious' media.  It was one of those stories that was totally bizarre, but you'd catch yourself thinking &quot;yeh, but what if--?&quot;<br />Andru and I spent many hours--probably way too many for his parents taste--watching HELP! and A HARD DAY'S RUT on the TV in his parent's den.  I'd like to take some credit for inspiring him to begin this book...but that would be quite a stretch.	2001-06-09

Once the survivors are rescued, Philbrick loses his storytelling ability.  Characters stumble all over each other in a confusing mismash.  Even Philbrick's writing gets worse in the last 50 pages; there are several sentences towards the end of this book that are simply incomprehensible.	2001-05-24

This is the place.  Although I'd like to find a more condensed version--actually going cover-to-cover here is a near impossibility--this is a valuable tool.	2001-05-22

But the AP Press Guide is an indisputable tool or the writing you do on the job--newswriting--and it is what it is.<br />You should have more than one guide, including some kind of in-house directions, sitting on your shelf.  This must be one of them.	2001-05-22

All of the Arthur books are worth owning, because they're fun for kids and parents will not be dulled to sleep when they read them.	2001-05-22
