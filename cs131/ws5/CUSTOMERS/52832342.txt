I know I have, like each one of us, a deep spiritual inner source beyond the limits of my own ego that I get to glimpse, for brief seconds at a time...........and by reading any part of PRACTICING THE POWER OF NOW each morning, or anytime during the day, more or less as an 'oracle'  or 'focus'...brings me another glimpse of that source.  This volume is slim in size, so I can carry it with me anytime. Thank you again, Eckhart Tolle.	2001-10-17

Given Allen's own success, it would seem that he knows what he's talking  about. A VISIONARY LIFE is a visionary book because it transcends the airy  platitudes found in many New Age books and get into the real, practical  work that it takes to not only have a successful life but to be a  successful person.	1999-03-30
