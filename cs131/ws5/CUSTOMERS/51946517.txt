US	51946517	R2ZDI1CQOQHCND	0966757130	833278374	Conversation Pieces	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Practical, provocative, and fun	As an ESL instructor who has taught conversation classes in several programs and often felt frustrated with superficial textbooks, \\"Conversation Pieces\\" stands out for its practical and fun format. Adam Rado, the coordinator of a large Intensive English Program at UCLA Extenstion, has pulled together a wide range of engaging classroom materials. Young adults, community college students, and working professionals seeking to share life experiences and share perceptions in an ESL classroom will appreciate this unusual workbook.<br /><br />The first section, titled Grammar-based Conversation questions, includes revealing questions that allow students to practice their English in a safe, structured, and illuminating format. The author, conscious of the need to match vocabulary and grammar skills to student abilities, provides 11 worksheets for Basic students, 14 for intermediate, and 13 for advanced. My favorite exercises include: \\"too/very\\"; \\"tell/say\\"; \\"take/get\\"; \\"for-in-ago\\" \\"do/make\\" \\"about verbs\\" and modals. The flexible exercises can be used for communicative activities in a grammar class or a review exercise for a writing course. (I got Santa Monica Community College to adopt the book for both an Advanced Conversation and a Intermediate Grammar course.) The second section, titled information gathering activities, encourages students to interview other English speakers - in and outside of the classroom. The friendly questions also allow students to examine their own lives and share personal experiences. There are 100 pages of solid classroom exercises in these two section.<br /><br />The third section, titled \\"bingo activities\\", seems more popular with high school and college students than older immigrants and working professionals. Topics include food, drinks, last night, weekends, favorites, gender roles, family issues, and values. The casual tone appeals to younger folks and tends to make more self-conscious students less comfortable. Yet these exercises often evoke laughter who seem to enjoy the playful, chatty format. Perhaps the author will publish a separate book just on Bingo games, geared to the High School and College prep markets, in the future. Personally, I'd like to see the current book become two separate worktext books for that reason. Instructors must preview the questions, and might choose to change some sensitive questions.<br /><br />Despite this minor criticism, I constandly recommend this book to students and fellow teachers because it leads to genuinely interesting, revealing conversations. I've used exercises in settings ranging from workforce training courses and adult schools to commmunity colleges and elite private universities with very positive results.<br /><br />School directors, ESL instructors, and English language learners should find the material practical, provocative, and fun. The textbook's versatility, ironically, has probably hindered its incorporation into ESL curriculums since committees often want very narrow, specific books for each linguistic skill. That's a \\"good mistake\\" since students need to speak, try out new vocabulary words, and practice grammar in context. This valuable, and affordable, worktext achieves those simple goals.

Does form follow function? What are some common mistakes in patent writing? The Evolution of Everyday Objects, explores the hidden history of axes, spoons, paperclips, garbage bags,tin cans, and zippers for a general audience. Henry Petroski, a professor of industrial design at Duke University, also introduces unlikely heroes like Walter Hunt (the safety pin) Richard Drew (Scotch tape), and Jacob Rabinow (pick-proof lock) while celebrating the marvels of engineering and industrial design.<br />This lucid primer weaves a weird and wonderful tale of techincal evolution and expanding consumerism. Petroski argues that disappointment with available choices inspires inventors, engineers, and industrial designers to continually expand our consumer choices. Form, contrary to rumors, follows failure. Edison's edict seems more apt than ever.<br />Petroski focuses on the telling details behind both familiar success stories and the far more frequent failures of consumer objects and modern artifacts. Although this 288-page paperback lacks illustrations and might seem a bit repeative and/or simplistic to specialists, Petroski's book should appeal to aspiring inventors, engineering students, and curious readers seeking a better understanding of our modern consumer culture. You might even look at your cluttered desk, a crowded department store, and your crammed tool shed with more appreciation.	2004-03-17

I picked it up, browsed at the title story, and found myself drawn into a difficult, often dismal life of an overweight and under-educated woman on a crowded Mexican bus.<br />This thin book, written by a middle-aged journalist and former cook, contains riveting tales of desperate folks seeking solace and satisfaction. Usually, they fail.<br />Stephen Blackburn, the author, brings great sensitivity to his portraits of Los Angeles nannies, Louisana cooks, lonely loners, Vietnam veterans, ambitious Boy Scouts, and Mexican women. People misperceive, take chances, make poor choices, find the courage to try something new, and fail again.  The litany of personal tales of woe afflicting these fine folks ranges from betrayl, crime, and poverty to indecision, drug abuse, and abusive employers in this Steinbeckian collection.<br />I can't pretend that I respected all these peculiar characters, but they felt authentic. This collection of short stories certainly deserves a wider audience of readers - especially in  community college classrooms and adult education centers. The costs of ignorance - emotional, physical, and financial - become extraordinary clear in this compelling work. I wouldn't be surprised to read a short story from here in a college anthology someday.	2004-01-15

Cavo summarizes and simplifies modern intrepretations of Mayan historical eras, major deities, and many surprising scientific achievements. Yet Cavo doesn't shy away from the less romantic aspects of Mayan cultures like a frequent civil wars, a rigid class structure and human sacrifice that so many New Age narrators overlook in their celebration of this &quot;spiritual&quot; culture.<br />While some adults find hesistate to pick up a 109-page comic book, this casual approach helped clarify several aspects that more academic books had only deepen by specialized jargon and excessive detail. Readers should know that the text, originally written in Spanish from a cynical point of view, contains many spelling errors that are easier to overlook when dealing so many new words from Mayan culture.<br />Tourists to Mayan ruins, struggling students, and archaelogy buffs should find this accessible work a helpful and satsifying guide. If I were teaching a class that included a section on Mayan civilizations for middle school, high school or even college, I would assign this book as a satisfying introduction to a confusing subject.	2004-01-15

This thick book offers the drill and kill approach to learning languages with far too much time spent on minor differences of more interest to linguists than to ESL students wanting to read, write, and speak English. What is the goal, anyway?<br />Yet even if one believes in dwelling on the smallest details of some idealized use of the English language, I'd hestitate to recommend to either the second or third versions. Why?<br />\\"Fundmentals\\" costs far too much, weighs too much, and contains far too many impractical exercises of limited practicality. Teachers may find the grammar puzzles fascinating, but students usually want to learn grammar so they can use the language.<br />In comparision, Raymond Murphy's \\"Grammar in Use\\" series (Cambridge University Press) provides far clearer examples, a simpler format, and a more logical format. It's also ideal for self-study since lesson's answers can be found in the back.<br />Plus, the \\"Grammar in Use\\" books cost far less. Administrators and teachers, especially ones working with immigrants and refugees, should consider price and practicality when choosing texts.<br />Granted, this \\"classic\\" text makes more sense in elite, private programs where wealthy studdnts are preparing for the TOEFL test outside of the United States. Yet immigrants and refugees, however, don't need, want, or have the time to master these often silly distinctions without a difference. They need practical readings and compelling conversation exercises that help them get better jobs, make smarter consumer choices, and fully participate in the society. Ms. Azar's book provides almost no assistance to immigrants as they struggle to create new lives in an often confusing, strange land.<br />Finally, I must confess that I don't like fundamentalists in religion or language study. The same excessive zeal and narrow-mindedness that can distort and pervert rich religious traditions can be detected in the Fundamentals of English Grammar. Ms. Azar wants new English readers to write - and speak - far \\"better\\" and more \\"correct\\" than the vast majority of native English speakers. She advocates a fossilized view of the English language where innovation, slang, and change are all \\"corruptions\\" and \\"wrong.\\" Let's just throw away the last century of art, film, and literature!<br />How can we, as English teachers, ask our immigrant students to write and speak better than of the President of the United States?e zeal and narrow-mindedness that can distort and pervert rich religious traditions can be detected in the Fundamentals of English Grammar.

It's almost ideal for self-study since each lesson (unit) can stand alone and unit answers can be easily found and understood.<br />Plus, the \\"Grammar in Use\\" books cost about half as much as the other \\"classsic\\" texts like Betty Azar's overrated and impractical \\"Fundamentals of English Grammar.\\" Administrators and teachers, especially ones working with immigrants and refugees, should consider price and practicality when choosing texts.<br />Just compare \\"Grammar in Use\\" with Azar's \\"Fundamentals of English Grammar.\\" Murphy's text uses 340 pages to explain esential grammar points while Azar takes almost 600 pages to overwhelm students with exceptions to rules. Murphy's book focuses on common expressions and everyday language; Azar's thick book offers the drill and kill approach to learning languages.<br />Granted, many ESL teachers have an almost religious faith in the Azar series. They can recycle their grammar lessons year after year. But the Azar series costs far too much, weighs too much, and contains far too many impractical exercises of limited practicality. ESL Teachers may find the Azar's grammar charts fascinating, but adult students will find Murphy's series helps them actually using English at work, school, home, and shopping. What is the goal, anyway?<br />Since immigrants and refugees don't need, want, or have the time to master these often silly grammar distinctions without a difference, I strongly recommend Cambridge University' \\"Grammar in Use\\" series. Don't busy adult students deserve an accessible, practical grammar text?<br />I don't usually like requiring grammar books for adult ESL classes. The desire to speak \\"correct\\" English can sometimes morph into a strange cult of some idealized English that one can't find spoken in American cities. Still, Murphy's clear exercises avoid this common pitfall by focusing on essential grammar points, using practical examples, and skipping over the peculiar oddities that mesmerize too many grammar fundamentalists. This affordable book lives up to its title and helps students learn English by using the language.<br />Finally, \\"Grammar In Use\\" stands out as the most student-friendly grammar series that I've seen in a decade of teaching English composition and ESL.

What were the different strategies used by government agencies to promote American ideals, self sacrifice, and gas rationing to a scared and confused public? Which advertising methods and artistic techniques worked best? Why?<br />This concise, colorful guide examines the power, poetry, and politics of American WWII posters in five thematic chapters. Delving beneath the surface of over 150 colorful posters, the authors showcase and analysis the zig-zag evolution of wartime posters.<br />Personally, I found chapter three (Art, Advertising, and Audience) to be a fascinating summary of vigorous debate among message makers. How should the war effort be framed? Is it a struggle for truth and democracy against terror and fascism? Is it a battle for survival? Should the focus be on personal fears, national achievements, or heroic freedom fighting?<br />George Gallup, later of pollster fame, urged posters be designed to appeal to \\"the lower third\\" of the population. Other analysts warned that the Office Of Facts and Figures early communication efforts were too abstract and contained too much information. \\"It would be wonderful indeed if the psychological war could be fought on an intellectual basis,\\" warned two critics \\"if the American people who will win or lose this war were so educated and conditioned that we could bring them understanding on the terms we all prefer. But, through no fault of ours, they unfortunately are so educated. And in pitting the strategy of truth against the strategy of terror, we cannot stop to educate - we must win a war. We must state the truth in terms that will be understood by all levels of intelligence. Further, we must dramatize the truth.\\" Powerful images soon replaced statistics in posters.<br />The considerable efforts to coordinate wartime messages across departments also generated vigorous debate. Eventually, the newly formed Office of Wartime Information identified six basic propaganda themes for general information programs: The nature of the Enemy; the nature of our Allies; the need to work; the need to fight; the need to sacrifice; and Americans and our ideals.<br />This visually appealing book also carefully examines the proliferation of wartime posters, full of patriotic messages, created by non-profit organizations, unions, and corporations. The last chapter, Postwar Aims and Private Aspirations, focuses on the impact of Sheldon-Claire company posters celebrating the middle class home, the traditional nuclear family, consumerism, and free enterprise. It also features a haunting gas mask poster produced and distributed by Kroger Grocery store chain.<br />The epilogue, the weakest section by far, argues that the change in postwar workplace posters reflected a more condescending air toward workers, explicit anti-union messages, and the renewnal of industrial conflict between management and labor. This thin section seems both out-of-place and a disjointed conclusion.<br />Design for Victory, despite this somewhat weak ending, should satisfy the curiousities of graphic designers, artists, historians, and scholars interested in advertising methods and persuasive communication.em understanding on the terms we all prefer.

This fine book, which I read in less than two hours, remains a solid primer. Both longtime admirers of Camus and undergraduate students forced to read his celebrated novels should find this brief work a valuable investment of time.<br />It's also worth noting that cartoons are often read by adults in Europe. The format provides readers with a superficial, yet accessible and non-threathening, way to enter into academic and philosophical discussions. College and high school teachers of French, literature, and philosophy would benefit from adding this book to their students while assigning any novel by Camus.	2002-06-05

This concise biography provides brief summaries of his most important intellectual works, introduces some of his key concepts, and acknowledges the profoundly deluded political predictions of this controversial French philosopher. If the personal is political, then Foucault's private life as a hyper-sexual gay hedonist and seducer of young boys - and death from AIDS - can be seen as the logical consequences of his peculiar belief systems where there is no objectivity and everything is subjective.<br />This comic book biography explores the paradox of Foucault, one of the most influential modern philosophers, right from the first page. \\"Should we look at the life of the man himself, who as a boy wanted to be a goldfish, became a philosopher and historian, political activist, leather queen, bestseller, tireless campaigner for dissident causes? What about his literary skill, combined with painstaking historical inquiry, his excellence as a pasta cook, captivating lecturing style, passion for sex with men, occassional drug-taking, barbed sense of humour, competitiveness, fierce temper - and the fact that he came from a family of doctors and dearly loved his mother?\\" The cartoon of the bald intellectual includes the caption/quote from Foucault: \\"Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same.\\" Fairness and multidimensional from the beginning.<br />While many academics will inevitably find this introduction too brief and too superficial, this thin and accessible book draws readers into Foucault's ideas, passions, and lives. Far more lively and engaging than than most secondary sources for undergraduate philosophy students, this black and white, adult comic book provides a comfortable entry point into some of the great intellectual debates of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  It also delights in contradictions and paradoxes.<br />Did you know that the man who subtley explored the connections between order and brutality promoted the new Islamic Government in Iran in 1979? How could a gay, leftist western intellectual support religious fanatics? \\"An Islamic government cannot restrict people's rights because it is bound by religious duty,\\" claimed Foucault to reporters while visiting Tehran. \\"The people will know what is right.\\" The harsh objective reality of public executions and stonings -including women who refused to wear the proscribed veil- soon silenced Foucault. The authors cover this embarrassing situation with an admirable directness on p.79. His other questionable political crusades are also examined in a sympathetic, yet critical light.<br />This thin book, digestible in a few hours, would make an excellent companion text for both undergraduate and graduate philosophy students confronted with reading a Foucault tome. It would be a valuable addition to college libraries and belongs on the bookshelves of postmodernists - and Foucault's critics.so delights in contradictions and paradoxes.<br />Did you know that the man who subtley explored the connections between order and brutality promoted the new Islamic Government in Iran in 1979?

Going beyond the trivia answers, McCullough recreates the historical context and human passions that drove Alexander von Humboldt to explore South America, Frederic Remington to paint a vanishing way of life, Harriet Beecher Stowe to write Uncle Tom's Cabin (the most popular book - and play of the 19th century America!), and Miriam Rothschild's studies of insects.<br />Yet the most fascinating chapter, by far, celebrates the literary powers of pioneer airplane pilots: Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Beryl Markham, and Charles and Anne Lindbergh. Rising above the clouds as no man or woman had ever done before, these courageous souls combined a love of science and technology with a sense of reverence for nature's beauty. &quot;With the advance of the airplane, they were sure, the old barriers of time and distance would give way, bringing humanity closer together,&quot; writes McCullough. &quot;That they would also share a common crisis in such faith is also part of their story.&quot;<br />McCullough does a remarkable job of resurrecting quirky hereoes and suggests that &quot;courage is contagious.&quot; Perhaps he's wrong, but I hope he's right as we begin a new century of unknown peril and possibility.<br />P.S. I've given a few copies of this book as gifts to relatives and friends.	2002-05-23

How important is haggling for prices? What would you do in a medical emergency?

Part travelogue and part philosophy, this book includes 18 chapters organized around particular dilemas. The breezy format feels like a selection of USA Today Travel Tips for the more adventuresome (and/or socially responsible)travelers.<br />While I often disagreed with the author's conclusions, I appreciated the balanced approach to very complicated situations. You can finish the entire book in one seating.

Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (1772-1810) avoids obscure religious references to any holy book while encouraging readers to \\"never despair!\\" and \\"get into the habit of dancing.\\"<br />  \\"Always remember: joy is not merely incidental to your spiritual quest,\\" warns Nachman, a Hasadic leader in Ukraine during a turbulent time of religious persecution. \\"It is vital.\\" Nachman's inspirational quotes, often given in imperative sentences, focus on the need to liberate yourself by maintaining hope and secluding yourself daily.<br />  Adored by his followers, many modern readers will find his extremely optimistic assertions questionable. \\"When troubles come, as they will, take comfort in your faith that whatever happens is for the best,\\" advises Nachman. This soothing advice, especially in light of the Holocaust and suicide bombers, remains a very difficult task for contemporary adults.<br />  Still I have found myself drawn to this wise little book on many somber, pensive occassions. The Rebbi seems like a kind, tolerant older brother urging me forward toward the light. \\"Go carefully: spiritual growth must proceed slowly and steadily. Too often we want to improve ourselves and our relationships so quickly that we make ourselves frustrated and confused.\\" Doesn't that sound very apt for the 21st century?<br />  For whatever reason, I have found myself giving copies of this book to friends during times of emotional confusion and mild depression. It seems to strike a familiar chord and ease burdens. What more can a thin book do?	2002-03-23

The section titled \\"Posters and Reality\\" includes vivid posters and explores the ideas of expressionism, realism, and surrealism in an accessible, yet scholarly manner.<br />\\"Posters and Society\\", however, remains my favorite section. Tracing the evolution of the poster through travel, theater, and liquor ads, Barnicoat explains the significance of outdoor advertising in modern cities. Posters also seem to lend themselves to an ironic, comic style.<br />Yet the classic posters from World War I and II show that governments can also develop ideas in the popular medium. Wartime posters played a critical role in recruitment of soldiers, selling War Bonds, and instructing civilian populations to conserve precious supplies.<br />Barnicoat also seems fascinated with the use of posters by communist (Soviet Union, Mao's China, Castro's Cuba) and fascist dictatorships (Nazi)to create \\"consensus\\" and the illusion of mass support. He juxaposes these propagnda efforts with the students' posters of May '68 saying \\"these were attempts to produce a genuine pattern of popular art.\\" (While few propaganda posters have become popular collectibles, wartime posters and protest posters from the 1960s command good prices these days among vintage poster collectors.)<br />Written in 1973 in a belated celebration of the poster's 100th birthday, this classic art book does show its age - both in the evident leftist sympathies and ignoring recent trends. Posters: A Concise History, however, remains the best introduction for art lovers, graphic designers, and poster collectors.	2002-03-21

Gregory has pulled together 110 distinctive images, some beautiful, some simple, and many surprising - to create a visual catalog of propaganda efforts to recruit soldiers, sell war bonds, and encourage civilians to conserve rubber.<br />Some familiar images, like Rockwell's Four Freedoms poster series, articulate American ideals. Many graphic images use humor and fear to emphasize worker safety and efficiency in factories. I was surprised to find posters targeting cooks and children with messages like: \\"lick the platter clean.

It allows you to quickly research difficult topics, check the veracity of a book, and follow your intellectual curiousity.<br />For example, I recently watched a biography of Frederick Douglass, the 19th century abolitionist. That revitalized my interest in the fiery orator and the abolitionist movement. The Reader's Companion contains a concise, yet in-depth profile that emphasizes Douglass' insights into the roots and consequences of racism in the 19th century.<br />This hefty reference work, featuring the work of respected scholars should be used by anyone enrolled in a United States History course, professional historians, and amateur historians.<br />There is also enough balance that you can easily detect the biases of various writers.	2002-03-14

This fiery autobiography, written as anti-slavery propaganda, told of his struggle to gain freedom, identified his \\"owner\\", and became a 19th century national bestseller. Long before Uncle Tom's Cabin opened the eyes of sentimental Northerners to the evils of slavery, Douglass' chronicle inspired the small abolitionist movement and challenged the conscience of the United States to live up to the heroic ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence... \\"all men are created equal.\\"<br />The publication of this masterpiece also forced Douglass into exile in England for two years to avoid capture by slave traders. British supporters eventually \\"purchased\\" Douglass allowing this great American to return to the United States and live in freedom.<br />While the battle against slavery was won almost 150 years ago, this autobiography's remains a very powerful tool against racism, ignorance, and historical amnesia. Douglass links his quest for literacy with his need to be treated as a man - and become a free man. This book should be required reading, for all American schoolchildren, in the middle school and excerpts should be constantly used in high school and college courses. Adult literacy centers should find this story a powerful  inspiration too.	2002-03-14

Because so many of the environmental issues, and surrounding philosophical questions, remain the same almost a decade later. The Green Pages stands out as an excellent primer on environmental issues with 39 indepth articles by leading experts and focuses on what each individual can do to live a greener lifestyle. (Yes, there are some real extreme back to nature Greenies here, but there are many more sensible suggestions for average California consumer.)<br />&quot;We can no longer depend on government or industry to save us,&quot; writes Rick Luskin of the Malibu-based Environment Now foundation. &quot;We must enlist consumers to produce a cleaner, safer environment. We all make hundreds of decisions every day in the marketplace, and each decision has consequences.&quot;<br />That &quot;the world is on your shoulders&quot; theme continues. Noting that reforming government and lobbying for greener laws can take time, many writers emphasize personal responsibility.<br />The Green Pages underscores the essential fact that elected representatives and corporate decision makers would be far more likely to &quot;bite the bullet&quot; and suggest environmental alternatives if more American consumers were willing to recharge electric batteries, ride the bus, take shorter showers, and pay &quot;sin taxes&quot; on products like gasoline and wood.<br />Perhaps this manual for green, frugal living will find a larger audience in the post 9/11 world. Stranger things have certainly happened.	2002-02-03

A Polish emigre who survived numerous horrors as a Jewish child during World War II, Jerzy Kosinski escaped the Holocaust, as well as communism, becoming a celebrated American writer of often bleak, haunting, and nightmarish works. The sardonic author of The Pained Bird, Steps, Pinball, and Being There consciously created an aura of mystery with his \\"autofictional\\" novels and flamboyant lifestyle. Kosinski's 1991 suicide, following a period of declining healthy and increasing literary criticism, shocked many of his firneds - and added to enigmatic image as a cult figure.<br />Passing By:Selected Essays, 1962-1991, Kosinski's post-humous book of previously published and unpublished writings, claims to answer many questions about his controversial life. Partially compiled by himself and finished by his wife and two friends, Passing By contains 51 literary essays, magazine articles, New York Times op-ed pieces, and political speeches organized in ten chapters rangigng from \\"Life and Art\\" and \\"Self vs. Collective\\" to \\"People, Places, and Me\\" and \\"The Sporty Self.\\"<br />One of many surprising, and fascinating, chapters is titled \\"God &\\" where Kosinski reflects on his persecution as a child and his \\"spiritual inheritance\\" as a \\"circumcised Catholic.\\" \\"I'm a missionary to only one particular life: the life within me; and I proselytize only one faith: my faith in the sanctity of life.\\"<br />Given Kosinski's intimate writings about painful childhood memories and erotic adult fantasies, however, Passing By maintains a strange silence on his private life. The only direct reference to the author's suicide, for example, is on the book jacket. No defense, explanation, or context for Kosinski's decision can be found. (Kosinski does praise the great French biologist Jacques Monod, a longtime friend, for his philosophical acceptance of his terminal condition in \\"Death in Cannes.\\" \\"Mercy killing interests me,\\" said Monod. \\"Mercy living does not.\\")<br />Clearly designed to hint and allude, rather than decipher or explain, Kosinski's essays mirror his fictional style. A man who loved secrets and disguises, Kosinski retains his control of readers' perceptions with illuminating symbols and brilliant metaphors.<br />For better and worse, Passing By resembles Kosinski's montage-like novels of fragmented perceptions by refusing to offer a grand summation or any final judgements. Instead, readers are left with contradictory statements and tentative conclusions.<br />The Kosinski mystique remains.ather than decipher or explain, Kosinski's essays mirror his fictional style.

Super Mario, Nintendo's mascot, became more familiar to American children in 1990 than Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse. Nintendo also dominated the market that holiday season by owning 25 of the top 30 most popular toys sold. American toy companies Hasbro and Mattel were left far, far behind.<br />Author David Sheff concludes, \\"Nintendo sailded past stalwart American corporations such as IBM, Disney, and Apple Computer, not only in profitability, but also in impact on American culture.\\" The melodramatic title broadcasts his peculiar premise that there is something very sinister about millions of obsessive American children playing witty and clever video games - if they are designed by a Japanese company for profit. (Do American companies seek a loss?) Written during the mid 1990's when fear of Japan was still strong, Sheff's  seems to pander to populist anxieties about new technologies, foreigners, and big international companies in the opening chapters.<br />Ironically, the majority of Sheff's book undercuts those exaggerated fears of conquering Asians using \\"ruthless scorched earth\\" business practices like developing affordable hardware and creative software products. Social scientists and psychologists are extensively quoted praising Nintendo games as more interactive, intellectually demanding, and entertaining than television. (This was written in the pre-internet, pre-web era.) Sheff also dissects parental allegations that Nintendo games hynotize kids by releasing endorphins, and notes that Nintendo wasn't invented to be a babysitter. Sheff suggests, however, that Nintendo might be a better babysetter than commercial television for latch-key kids.<br />Beneath the sensational promotional title and occasssional Japan-bashing nonsense, Game Over ultimately emerges as a solid examinatin of modern warfare and the rise of a dynamic Japanese entertainment empire.

While many things irk John Leo, the academic left's tendency to radically expand the meaning of words like \\"racism\\", \\"rape\\" and \\"rights\\" inspires columns of outrage and humor. Racism, not so long ago, meant denying people the right to vote, eat in a restaurant, or even a trial prior to lynching. Now the word, observes Leo, has morphed into anything that makes people feel uncomfortable. Leo, being a traditionalist, wants words to mean to have precise meaning. Who can blame him?<br />This wide-ranging collection of his favorite essays captures Leo's brilliant wit, brual logic, and safely narrow range of subjects. Attacking the 1990's as the \\"golden age of censorship,\\" Leo rebukes the right for wanting to censor everything: \\"pornography, rap, rock singers, military news, J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, photors of Robert Mapplethorpe's idea of a good time, and the burning of the American flag.\\" Yet the left, Leo's primary target, \\"wants to censor tobacco ads, girlie calendars and sex jokes in the workplace, Saturday morning TV, overly Eurocentric schoolbooks, Andy Rooney, many college newspapers, all sorts of speech, and the waving of the American flag.\\"<br />Leo, it seems to me, reflects the views of his mostly moderate, upper-income readers. He dissects the loonier edges of leftist political activists far more than vapid euphemisms that fill commercials and deflect attention from the misdeeds of the Enrons of our society.<br />Perhaps Leo will find a way, in his sequel, to make all professional liars equally uncomfortable.	2002-02-03

All cultures were, despite all evidence to the contrary, equal. Some people ate with forks; others with chopsticks. Some cultures had elections, provided universal public education, and used hi-tech computers. Others persecuted women, celebrated brutal dictators, and praised murder in the name of some religion. All were equal. There was no difference between the backward, primative Afghanistan and modern, democratic United States.<br />How did this nonsensical, ultra-romantic idea become so widespread - almost unquestioned - &quot;truth&quot; in academic circles? The End of Racism helps answer this puzzling question. First, anthropoligists expand the word &quot;culture&quot; to include all and any behavior. Cannabalism is one culture; shopping at the malls is another cultural activity. In the aftermath of WWII and the Nazi's glorification of Aryans as a superior people, the newly created UNESCO declares that all civilizations/cultures are equal. This diplomatic ideal becomes the foundation for multicultural education across the United States a few decades later.<br />This thick tome deserves to be read - or at least skimmed - by everyone interested in the terrible legacy of racism. Educators, administrators, and social activists will find D'Souza's discussion of Booker T. Washington and W.B.DuBois to be illuminating. Washington emphasized the need for individuals to become educated, skilled, and moral while W.B.DuBois emphasized the need to change laws, customs, and social structures. While they could have ideally complemented each other, these two men became fierce antagonists. D'Souza tracks the statements - and consequences -of each man's philosophy. Needless to say, W.B.DuBois the Pan Africanist Marxist - despite his brilliant achievements as a writer and activist - provided far more false answers than real responses to the acute suffering of his people.<br />There are dozens of fascinating snapshots of intellectual debates, over several centuries, in this comprehensive work. The endnotes are an education in themselves.<br />After celebrating differences between civilizations for three decades in academia, perhaps people are ready to hear some hard, cold, and uncomfortable truths.<br />We can only hope that the distinction between moral and immoral, rational and irrational, just and unjust, modern and primative, will again be considered relevant.ffering of his people.<br />There are dozens of fascinating snapshots of intellectual debates, over several centuries, in this comprehensive work.

Why did nightclub owners discourage Billie Holiday from singing this protest song against the murder of innocent Blacks? How did this powerful, somber song become Time Magazine's Best Song of the Century?<br />David Margolick traces the history of Strange Fruit from a forbidden, banned song to a celebrated cry for civil rights in a concise style. Performers, club owners, reviewers, and activists are extensively quoted - and the differing perceptions allowed to exist next to each other without comment.<br />This facinating book should be carried in all public school libraries, read in courses on American music. It's a fine addition to the scholarship on the civil rights movement too.<br />I do have, however, one serious criticism. Somehow, even if in just a single sentence, Margolick should have noted the irony of sensitive, gentle progressive defending Stalin's regime. Several key people, great souls, involved in the early civil rights movement - including the songwriter of Strange Fruit - were members of the Communist Party during the Stalin's dictatorship. They were outraged at the lack of freedom for blacks in America, and their criticisms of Jim Crowe laws were totally accurate. I wish, however, that Margolick had at least mentioned - once - their blindness toward the brutal rule of Stalin in the USSR.<br />The vast, vast majority of these progressive activists recognized their mistake, and their committment to the Bill of Rights and individual freedom only increased.<br />Despite this minor criticism, this is a fantastic book that documents the great change in American cultural norms over the last 50 years.It's hard to imagine a time when Billie Holiday and Strange Fruit would be banned and lynching accepted as a Southern tradition.<br />Thank God for progress!	2001-12-26

This international bestseller promised spiritual salvation to a defeated, hungry, and desperate people - especially Germans who considered themselves a special, elite race called Aryans.<br />This ambitious tome, subtitled &quot;a study of the secret history of religions&quot;, claimed to chronicle the evolution of spiritual seekers across time and space. It also claimed to identify both children of the light (Aryans) and children of the dark (Semities/Jews)as engaged in an eternal struggle for man's destiny. The confusing prose appears academic to many lay people, yet there are no footnotes, index, or bibliography. Readers were expected to simply accept these revealations, without question, from a great spiritual master. The only people who could &quot;understand&quot; the secrets were people whose soul was worthy of &quot;perceiving the veil.&quot;<br />Here is a typical passage from p.45: &quot;The Semitic current contains absolute and superior principles: the idea of unity and universality in the name of a supreme Principle which, in itas application, leads to the unification of the human family. The Aryan current contains the idea of ascending evolution in all terrestrial and supra-terrestrial kingdoms, and its application leads to an infinite diversity of developments in the richness of nature and the many aspirations of the soul. Semitic genius descends from God to man; Aryan genius ascends from man to God.&quot;<br />In simple words, the author claims Jews are humanitarians who wanted a peaceful, artificial, and universal culture based on man as he is today. The Aryans, on the other hand, wanted an advanced civilization for natural elite who understood that war was nature's way to push evolution and mastery over both the external and internal worlds. Weak vs Strong. The many vs. the few. Artifical vs. Natural. Pacifist vs. Warrior. Egalitarian vs. Elitism. Material vs Spiritual. The past vs. the future. Fossils vs. Masters.<br />These &quot;innocent&quot; beliefs spread across Weimar Germany, increased the prevalent anti-Semitism, and provided intellectual justification for the dehumanization of Jews as &quot;germs infecting the Aryan Fatherland.&quot;<br />The Bible says you can judge the seeds by the fruit it bears.

This collection would make an excellent house-warming - and apt warning - for any new homeowner. The essays \\"Help\\" \\"Design Flaws\\" \\"How to Have Fun at Home\\" \\"Deck the Halls\\" and \\"A Slight Inconvenience\\" illuminate some of the less pleasant aspects of contemporary daily life.<br />Yet Bryson also summons his dark wit on odd, yet potent, social absurdities. In \\"The Risk Factor\\", Bryson compares the perils of living in the United States with some other advanced countries with some surprising insights (there is almost no danger to secondhand smoking) and predictable rants (guns usually kill people the owner knows... and often loves). Perhaps the man loves statistics because he also wrote another witty  essay on weird ways people injure themselves in \\"Well, Doctor, I Was Just Trying to Lie Down.\\" His inspiration? Scanning the Statistical Abstract of the United States.<br />Along the way, Bryson celebrates Thanksgiving (The Best American Holiday), offers utopian suggestions for a better world (Rules for Living), puzzles over the growing perception that America is over crowded (Wide Open Spaces) and worries about sedentary habits of his fellow citizens (Why No One Walks.)<br />While some may one to linger over each essay, I read almost the entire book in a single, very satisfying afternoon on the beach.

Why would someone want to censor love stories (Dr. Zhivago, An American Tragedy, Women in Love, The Scarlet Letter)?

Thomas Jefferson, our philosopher of freedom, wrote, \\"the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\\" This book names the names of censors, identifies dangerous trends, remembers the popularity of censors, and celebrates the struggle of free spirits to live as free thinking individuals. \\"Banned Books\\" proves telling the truth and creating great stories can be dangerous to your health and reputation. Voltaire's advice, \\"dare to think for yourself\\" often carries a heavy social price.<br />Every library, and school library, should have this vital work on their shelves.

The good professor, obsessed with his namesake, however can't finish his epic poem or forget a sexual encounter with a student.  Despite some poignant historical vignettes illuminating the fanatic intensity of Columbus' search for gold, Jay Parini's cinematic technique of quick cuts traveling back and forth across five centuries becomes increasingly tiresome - and sometimes very confusing. The novel's bizarre climax, where the two Christophers' lives merge, reveals the limits of Parini's awkward imitation of magical realism.  The post script and final chapter, a symposium on Columbus' life and legacy moderated by St. Peter, features Noam Chomsky, Samuel Elliot Morrison, and God. This second ending - in both its disconnection from the preceding 370 pages and its breezy style - ironically shows why Bay of Arrows could have been a classic short story.  Unfortunately, Parini's &quot;whimisical parody&quot; - cursed with a vocabulary worthy of a German metaphysician - becomes a boring, unfocused rant. It's a shame.

Western historian David lavender never hides his sympathy in this powerful chronicle of Chief Joseph's &quot;flight toward freedom&quot; in 1877 to avoid reservation life.  This is a really sad story filled with overlooked possibilities for compromise, understanding, and tolerance. Lavender considers the Nex Perce War the final betrayal of a long and once-promising relationship between white explorers, fur trappers, Christian missionairies, and the tribe. Chief Old Joseph, father of the more famous Chief Joseph, even converted to Christianity for both spiritual and practical reasons. Peaceful coexistence and friendship with the new settlers was his policy. Greed, cultural intolerance, and racial hatred eventually doomed those possibilities for Nez Perce.  Although Chief Joseph developed a reputation as an Indian Napeleon for his brilliant fighting tactics, Lavender emphasizes that Chief Joseph continually sought to avoid war. Chief Joseph's simple hope was to have a reservation that would allow his people to live in their traditional land and stay close to his father's grave in Wallowa Valley, Oregon. The United States military commanders of that time, however, demanded the tribe move.  This compelling account of the Nez Perce's failed 1700 mile exodus to join Sitting Bull in Canada captures the cruelty, mindlessness, and viciousness of 19th century America's expansionist policies. Chief Joseph's eloquent words, especially when surrending after a blizzard just a few miles south of the Canadian border, accents the pain and injustice.	2001-02-27

The widespread obsessions with religion, trade, Spanish empire building, and bureaucratic organizations are meticulously documented.<br />The Worlds of Christopher Columbus stands out as a balanced, fair, and well-researched  work examining the life and legacy of Columbus within the context of his times, European exploration, Christian theology, and the search for quicker/safer trade routes. The book combines a wide variety of sources and perspectives as it chronicles Columbus' four voyages, and many more controversies, to the New World.<br />The authors, both historians at University of Minnesota, essentially argue that Columbus reflected the basic assumptions of his era like &quot;a prism&quot; combining ambition, zealous Christianity, and excellent navigation skills. The right man at the right place and time, Columbus sought recognition for opening Asia to trade and the expansion of Christianity. Ironically, Coulumbus always passionately condemned the idea that his &quot;his world&quot; was a &quot;new continent.&quot;  This valuable work brings new insights to the gradual evolution in Columbus goals, from Asian trading and building African style trading posts to island colonization. Columbus' decision to make slavery an economic cornerstone of Spain's new territories recevies special attention. (Queen Isabella, of Spanish Inquistion fame, opposed the enslavement of native tribespeople for religious reasons.)	2001-02-27

The concise, yet detailed, entries provide excellent thumbnail sketches.<br />Yet there are some peculiar features to this ambitious and beautiful encyclopedia. First, there are the baffling typos like listing Pope John XXIII as condemning heretics in the 13th century (p.174... didn't somebody remember the soon to be sainted 20th century Pope John XXIII? Perhaps it was supposed to be John XXII.)<br />Yet, like some other reader-critics, I found the discussion of Jews to be, well, peculiar. The descriptions sound more medieval than modern. Persecutions are de-emphasized, explained, and almost justified. Consider the following paragraph, under Jews, on p.260: &quot;It is also significant that in the first generation of Dominican inquisitors there were a number of Jewish converts. So the attack of the papal inquisition on the Jews in the 13th century France in part represented a split among the intellectuals of the Jewish community. The same internal culture conflict occurred in the days of the Spanish Inquisition around 1500.&quot;  Is the author blaming the converted Jews for the torturing and burning of thousands of devout Jews? Is he implying that the inquisition might have been, well, unchristian, and that's because of the converted Jews? What is this nonsense?<br />Likewise, the four page entry on Jews, single spaced without illustrations, concludes on p.261 with same highly unorthodox assertions about the size and dimensions of the Spanish Inquisition. Mainstream historians estimate the number of murdered Jews between 50,000 -100,000 and forced exile of several hundred thousand. The encyclopedia - without giving sources - says, &quot;the impact has been ridiculously exaggerated. In the whole history of Catholic inquisitions from early 13th century France to early 17th century Spain and Portugal, not more than 5,000 Jewish families suffered capital and less severe punish at the hands of the Church courts.&quot; Perhaps the author wants to count families, instead of people, to reduce the number of innocent victims. Or perhaps the author means to shift blame to crazed mobs that burned entire neighborhoods with the blessing of Church authorities... and outside court procedures. Yet murder is murder.<br />I'm grateful that I bought and read several sections of this important work.

Why  were these devous, courageous, and often difficult people widely believed  to be doing God's work? Marcus, a Dominican friar and Catholic chaplain to  the University of Edinburgh, uncovers a surprisingly long history of social  activism in sixteen poignant profiles of relatively obscure saints.  Long  before Thomas Merton pleaded for peace during the Vietnam War and Jesuit  Father Daniel Berrigan went to jail for pouring blood on nuclear weapons,  the core teachings of the Catholic Church have inspired - and protected -  many crusaders for radical social change. &quot;Acting as if you have  faith&quot; has brought out the noblest side of humans - and sustained many  uphill challenges to corrupt earthly powers.  This vital book illuminates  that religious zeal, exceptional faith in things unseen, deserves more  credit than it usually gets today when secular historians often highlight  only the negative aspects of church history.<br />I learned a tremedous amount  from this odd, little scholarly book: Labeling poverty and oppression as  social sins long predates liberation theology; Teresa of Avila showed God's  grace could provide woman with exceptional intelligence; and Antonino of  Florence (1390-1444) overcame pervasive apathy by caring for plague victims  and orhans; and Vincent De Paul, sometimes called the &quot;father of  social work&quot;, developed programs to help the poor.  This fascinating  history, espcecially for socially conscious Catholics, shows dynamic  individuals identifying the stupidities and cruelities of their own  societies - in service of their God and their souls. A wonderful counter to  too-prevalent notion that pure selfishness is the only way to live.	2000-09-12

Williams' recreates the political and historical atmosphere  of Manifest Destiny era in a critical, yet sympathetic biography that  should become a standard work for 19th century history buffs.  Williams  portrays Houston as a charmistic man and alcoholic, a distrustful populist,  and an authentic American hero who tried to keep Texas in the Union.<br />Williams' Houston is also an easy target for revisionist historians  looking for expansionist villains. An occassional supporter of the Know  Nothing party, Houston defended slavery and advocated a war with Mexico to  unite all Americans in 1860.  It was a futile effort to both prevent the  Civil War and become president of the United States. Williams suggests that  Houston's temper and penchant for secrecy blocked his highest political  ambitions.<br />Williamns' vibrant biography illuminates the enduring appeal  (and danger) of an authentic military hero and populist politician. Full of  memorable quotes and extensive resource notes, this compelling biography is  the kind of first rate history that tantalizes readers with absorbing  &quot;what ifs&quot; and the lost possibilities of a distant time and  place.<br />I learned a great deal reading this book and highly recommend it.  Books like this demonstrate how many great stories remain untold or  forgotten in our history - even when cities and streets are named after  yesterday's idols.	2000-09-04

Written in the era of Ross Perot and Jerry Brown and focused on the  Savings and Loan scandal that cost taxpayers at least $200 Billion dollars,  this insightful book identifies many factors behind the growing power of  transnational corporations to set the national agenda. Villains include an  expanding executive branch, the collusion of both major parties with Wall  Street interests, the increasing use of technical jargon in the halls of  power, and a press that seems more focused on selling celebrities than  examining policies.<br />Greider's prophetic book, written in 1992,  anticipates how NAFTA, GATT, and the most favored trade status with China  all passed - could be pushed through by a Democratic president (Clinton)  and a Republican Congress in a bipartisan effort. Polls, by the way, showed  the vast majority of Americans oppossed to all three pieces of legislation.  A populist political critic, Greider suspects what is good for Wall Street  might not be good for Main Street. (Of course, many people living on Main  Street owe some stock too.)<br />I first read this book in 1992, and wondered  if Greider was exaggerating to make more compelling copy. Re-reading parts  today and knowing the disaster caused by NAFTA, Greider emerges as one of  the few political analysts aware of the signifance of trade to Wall Street  and the negative influence on corporate money on both  parties.<br />&quot;We're perilously close to not having a democracy,&quot;  warms Greider, noting that while many elements are involved in  disenfranchising the American public, none are buried secrets and all are  familiar features. Campaign finance reform, of course, remains the  preferred euphemism for legalized bribery used to win Congressional votes  and manipulate regulatory decisions. Incumbents like the system (shock,  shock) and reformers seem to lose in primaries (McCain, Bradley.) Greider  makes a few commonsense suggestions: more press coverage of how government  actually works, campaign finance reform, and elections on the weekends.<br />Unfortunately, this witty tirade, written with outrage and fury, seems  more relevant today than ever. Both moderate Republicans and conservative  Democrats support unrestricted trade leaving true outsiders like Nader and  Buchanan to articulate the fair trade argument. Greider suggests that the  possibilities for renewing American democracy are dwindling -despite  technological advances that could revitalize citizen activism.<br />A  fascinating, sobering book for the 2000 election season.campaign finance reform, and elections on the weekends.  <br />Unfortunately, this witty tirade, written with outrage and fury, seems  more relevant today than ever.

Roberts'  powerful narrative doesn't idealize the sometimes brutal Apache traditions  (cutting off a wife's nose if she was suspected of adultery, etc). Yet, it  seems to me, that the real villains clearly remain the Mexican troops who  purchased Indian scalps and casually murdered Apaches for fun and profit.  The American settlers, who seem to be hysterical, are likewise committed to  Manifest Destiny and seizing the Apaches' traditional lands. The federal  government and U.S. Cavalry, to my surprise, played the role of both  hunting Apaches and protecting them from the local settler population.<br />This book details some real quirky personalities from General Cook to  Geromino and documents a few forgotten dirty wars. (Cochise still comes  across a great chief who almost forced the federal government to abandon  New Mexico and Arizona to the Apache during the Civil War.)<br />An almost  perfect gift for history teachers, relatives living in the Southwest, or  addicts of 19th Century American history. Don't be surprised if a clever  travel agent uses this book for organizing tours in Arizona and New Mexico  one day!!!	2000-09-04

The author's  leftwing bias is clear and upfront as he documents the rise of the  Democratic Leadership Council (Senator Leiberman is the current chair - and  VP candidate) as the latest chapter in neglect and oppression of poor  minorites. Solomon concludes, &quot;to accept the mirage of a humanistic  Clinton administration it helps - enormously- to be white and not  poor.&quot; Written in 1994, this book anticipates the tensions between  Clinton and more hardline environmentalists and union activists concerned  about the World Trade Organization.<br />False Hope's harsh, and it is very  harsh, critique of the Clinton Administration's origins, motives, and  consensus solutions sounds too harsh for my ears. Still, False Hope offers  a breezy if depressing read that might be helpful as voters consider  whether to promote Gore and Leiberman to the White House. The question  remains whether false hope is better than no hope?	2000-09-04

Have you ever been trapped in a crowd, a hysterical crowd,terrified of the future? Imagine being a young Jewish woman doctor in Stalinist former Soviet Union during the Second War - and each decision might be fatal.  Fear, terror, and blind hatred rule the day - and everyone wants the young doctor to perform miracles when God seemed silent and remote.<br />This fascinating autobiography, written with a sharp sense of life's ironies and injustices, conveys the wisdom that comes from being a true survivor.  Compassion and knowledge can sometimes save a life - or mean nothing except dying with a conscience.  (It's worth juxaposing the Machevillian logic of Rich on that silly island TV show where ethics were jettisonned for money with the heroism of the partisans of WWII.) Ruzena also illuminates the brutality come so easily to so many individuals in the name of so abstract ideology like fascism or communism.<br />Perhaps Oprah could interview Ruzena so television viewers can see how a true hero behaves in a crisis! This inspirational story of a woman's survival, sacrifice, and success (living and enjoying life in the California) combats the easy cynicism that seems so pervasive today. We should never, Ruzena shows, underestimate what a smart woman can do - especially in a crisis!	2000-08-28

On one hand, he acknowledges that life is a  disappointment and almost all is vanity. On the other hand, sensual  pleasure provides some solace and a solid foundation for an ethics of  compassion.<br />While I often had to reread several passages a few times to  extract some clear understanding, this influential tome provides an  excellent overview of a controversial philosopher whose ideas continue to  inspire and confuse.<br />I found Schopenhaur's harsh denunciation of  nationalism particularly interesting given the fact that he was writing at  a time of rising German nationalism. &quot;The cheapest form of pride is  national pride; for the man affected therewith betrays a want of individual  qualities of which he might be proud since he would not otherwise resort to  that which he shares with so many millions.&quot; (p.276)<br />Given the  tragic consequences that extreme nationalism lead to in Germany during the  20th century, it seems a safe bet that Schopenhaur will remain a strong  philosophical presence in 21st Europe.	2000-06-23

This scholarly, yet accessible, book argues that Israel was forced to fight for its survival in 1967 because the Soviet Union wanted a second front against the United States. Written by a Rutgers history professor and  filled with detailed chapter notes, Klinghoffer makes a compelling argument  that both superpowers treated Vietnam and Israel as mere pawns in a global  struggle for power.<br />In the Spring of 1967, many liberal American Jewish  leaders found themselves in the odd position of oppossing American military  intervention in Vietnam - and urging President Johnson to deploy the  American Navy to the Mideast. The Soviet Union's support for the Arab cause  pushed Israel's Socialist Zionist leadership to relucantly shift from  neutrality to become a strong American ally.<br />This work details how the  distinct possibility of a second Holocaust in the Mideast woke up many  idealistic Israelis and American Jews to see the dangers of third world  revolutionary movements. Klinghoffer also effectively links domestic  political concerns with international policies in Vietnam and the Middle  East with wit and confidence. An insightful work that seems quite plausible  - and helped me understand a confusing part of the world.<br />An excellent  primer on Mideast politics that unintentionally illuminates the problems  facing peace negotiators today.	2000-06-10

The errors begin on page 1 when Thomas Jefferson, a rather important American hero, is wrongly identified as the second president. Jefferson beat John Adams to become our third president. Since many ESL students are  also studying to become U.S. citizens and must pass a civics test, this  glaring error was immediately noticed in my California community college  class.<br />Unfortunately, this disappointing collection of sociological  essays seems more intent on promoting a left ideological bias than teaching  English or providing a wide range of perspectives. Sokolik, a professor at  Berkeley, CA, or his editors have filled this textbook with silly factual  errors, a strong multicultural slant, and a odd fascination with all things  racial and negative about the United States. (How many people celebrate  June as Black Musicians month?) The articles did inspire extensive class  discussions - often focused on the editor's peculiar choices and the sad  attempts at misinformation in the misleading charts in the index. It's fair  to ask if the subtle message isn't &quot;welcome to America - it's a racist  country run by greedy White folks. Life is better elsewhere.&quot; Given  the intense desire of new immigrants and foreign students to learn about  America, it's sad that Sokolik has taken this approach.	2000-06-04

A brutal, bleak, and brilliant work.  The Sorrow of War  revealed the back story to what I was seeing in Saigon - North Vietnam may  have won the won, but the people of Vietnam and America lost lives, limbs,  and loves. &quot;Everyone experienced difficult, painful, and different  fates.&quot;	2000-06-03

Hunt gives poignant images of young people trying to  survive in in a fast-changing country. They fantasize about the fabled  suburbs of America - the land of infinite consumer goods, exciting movies,  and Bay Watch. Yet the museums provide evidence of the long, brutal war  known as &quot;The American War.&quot;<br />Hunt's Vietnam remains an odd,  exotic country where anything can happen. How many places are there where  police shake you down, negotiate a bribe, and then give you a receipt!  I could relate to Hunt's twin desires to push the limits and  explore the unknown while riding along the broken Ho Chi Minh trail - and  being genuinely afraid. When does riding alone on a dark road become  stupid? Can you trust the innkeeper? How can you transcend being the  &quot;rich&quot; American in a poor country? What do people expect or want  from you? What do you want from them? When are you being set up? Does evil  lurk behind that smile? What topics, besides critizing Ho Chi Minh, are  taboo? Where are the boundaries of speech in a corrupt police state? Is it  fair for an American tourist to even comment on Vietnam's woes  If you  plan to see Hue, Saigon, Hanoi, or go to Laos, then this book presents  awkward situations worth considering before visiting Southeast Asia. It's a  travelogue, not an academic history of the area. Hunt critizes many aspects  of Vietnam - he's judgemental. That also makes the book more real because I  can't avoid, no matter how hard I might try, making judgements. You have to  make choices, and Hunt shares his decision making process with us. I  appreciated that!  I looked at many, many books before my trip. I took  Lonely Planet and the Rough Guide. This was the only book on Vietnam that I  read cover to cover with delight.	2000-06-03

My grandfather was murdered in a concentration  camp, and my father raised in a Brooklyn orphanage. A proud veteran of the  SS might have a different point of view.	2000-03-30

Kafka's conversations with a 17 year old poet show the very human side of  this literary genius. Perhaps best of all, you can open almost any page and  find an insightful dialog.

This insightful book explores the profound differences in decision-making over the last 2,500 years. Despite a penchant for social science jargon, the authors successfully translate a tremendous amount of current communications research on the creation and maintainance of belief systems  into an accessible book. &quot;Age of Propaganda&quot; documents the rise  of advertising, the decline of genuine public discourse, and the inherent  dangers of ten second soundbites in determining our desires, needs, and  goals. Further, they detail the unique difficulties in making a  &quot;rational&quot; decision in a fast-paced, message-dense, mass-media  culture.  This provocative and disturbing book also paints a potentially  bleak picture for America's democratic traditions. Fortunately, the authors  provide readers with &quot;an arsenal&quot; of intellectual tools to decode  messages and protect ourselves. As the authors conclude, &quot;we must  depend on our own knowledge of propaganda tactics and our own efforts to  treat important issues as if they were truly important.&quot;	2000-02-02

Written by a distinquished popular historian, this critical biography of the seventh United States President traces Jackson's dramatic rise to power from poverty. Hailed as the &quot;greatest man of the age&quot; by admirers and attacked as &quot;King Andrew the First&quot; by critics, Jackson  dramatically expanded the presidency's powers and dominated American  politics for two decades. After defeating the British at the Battle of New  Orleans and conquering the Creek Indians, Major General Jackson became a  national hero. Jackson soon organized what became the modern Democratic  Party to become President, vigorously ruled as President, and wiped out the  Federal debt. Synthesizing conflicting perspectives on this charismatic  populist leader, this well-written book also examines promotion of slavery,  the forced relocation of Indians against a Supreme Court decision, and  expansionist policies. Excellent annotated source notes for people  interested in further pursuing this fascinating era in American history.	2000-01-28

A beautifully illustrated pioneering reference guide examining the forced exile and voluntary migration of ethnic communities across political borders in search of safety, sanity, and freedom. This fascinating work  expands the original definition of &quot;diaspora&quot; beyond the Jews to  study the nature and history of minority groups in new lands. Detailed,  color historical maps accompany this ambitious, informative survey of the  Jewish, Armenian, Gypsy, Black, and Chinese Diasporas across centuries and  under many oppressive governments. While diasporas spread ideas, expand  trade, and make significant contributions to cultures, these minority  groups frequently have faced brutal persecution as outsiders without basic  rights in host countries. The American and French revolutions established  new principles of tolerance, but the Armenian genocide and Nazi Holocaust  prove that evil was still alive in the 20th century. Far shorter sections  also outline other ethnic diaspora communities including the Indian, Irish,  Vietnamese and Korean while placing the current global refugee crisis  within a larger context.	2000-01-28

While some academics still worry about people watching television, Douglass Rushkoff celebrates the power of individuals to create their own media presence in &quot;Media Virus.&quot;<br />In a witty style, Rushkoff  praises the MTV generation for their ability to do - and understand - more  than one thing at a time. Written in 1994, the book's seems a bit dated in  its predictions... and more than slightly optimistic in speculating about  the liberating aspects of new media to resurrect the political passions of  Americans. Media Virus remains an excellent overview of the tensions and  possibilities that television presents for political activists.	2000-01-27
