Every day Karin visits her husband Danny's grave, the husband she killed when his abuse finally became too much.  But her mourning has awakened a spark in Danny, and now he's coming back, fueled by a penchant for explosive violence and a thirst for revenge.<BR> It may not sound like much, but it's pretty well done - for the first half or so.  The descriptions of Danny's return to the land of the living are particularly, er, realistic (that is to say, it is shown convincingly, how you might expect it to happen.)  But once he's freed from his earthly prison, the book goes downhill.  The author seems mainly concerned with having Danny continually one-up himself in his rampage of murder and torture, and everything else falls by the wayside.  As graphic and over the top as these scenes are, they are really kind of dull.  The characters have no depth: the only hint we are given as to why Karin is the way she is comes in a brief prologue of her as a child.  We are told a few t! imes that Danny had a bit of goodness somewhere inside him, but we never see any evidence, so it's inexplicable to the reader that Karin would have any positive feelings for the man at all.  The other characters are throwaways.  None are likeable. <BR> It's not hard to see why Poppy Z. Brite raves about Devereaux's writing on the cover.  They both share a fondness for mindless gore at the expense of plot and characterization.  If you found her awful 'Exquisite Corpse' to your liking, you may wish to seek this one out.  Otherwise, don't bother.	1998-07-23
US	52971386	R29LVLNIS0D669	0061053384	593843215	Waking Beauty	Books	3	2	6	N	N	Original in concept, but ponderous in execution.	I can see why Witcover is compared to Clive Barker on the jacket text.  The two rival each other for verbosity.  'Waking Beauty' is a gratuitously overwritten novel that took me quite a long time to get through.  It wasn't that it wasn't interesting, but each chapter was such a task to read that I could only do it in small doses.  This is even more of a sore point when you realise that most of the set-up is thrown out towards the end of the book anyway.  The story changes direction completely and all the politics and ceremony that was so painstakingly depicted are rendered virtually meaningless.  All the characters are as in the dark as the reader until the last act - when the story finally picks up - and sadly, the revelations we are eventually shown are not quite worth the wait.  If only the entire work was as strong as that final sequence.	1998-07-22
US	52971386	R1M7CRHYBQKZKP	044021503X	425043459	Revenant	Books	4	4	5	N	N	The loved lost.	A mother whose children were killed in a car accident.  An old woman whose husband lies in the grip of Alzheimer's.  A man who longs for the sister he loved as a child.  A fifteen-year-old girl who aborted her baby.  A little boy whose mother abandoned him as an infant.  One by one these and others are led by the ones they grieve for to the hidden town of Revenant.  The ghosts are not merely of the dead, but of those who once were or might have been.  Revenant feeds on the grief of the living.  Some will break free of their emotional chains; others will be consumed.  In her third solo novel, Melanie Tem again displays her mastery and understanding of human nature with astounding depth.  Though her award-winning first novel, 'Prodigal', remains my favourite, this book is also remarkable in it's way.  Truly one of the finest writers of original, modern, *meaningful* horror fiction.  Recommended.	1998-07-07

'Kissing' is the story of the curious relationship shared by two twentysomethings: an illegitimate child-woman named Mina, and Stephen, the man obsessively in love with her.  Occasionally explicit in language but subtle in its eroticism, it is an engrossing study of two people's growth, from youth to adulthood, together and apart from one another.  A beautiful short novel that arouses as it draws blood; highly recommended.	1998-06-25

It concerns a young painter named Isabelle and the magical ability she possesses, which manifests itself through her work.  A series of tragic events causes her to abandon her Art, but now, nearly twenty years after her initial training, a letter from an old friend forces her to confront the past she'd buried under lies and denial.  <BR> My main problem with the story is that its premise - that Izzy can bring to life entities from her paintings - was too fantastic.  Bear with me here; I know it's fantasy, and I've certainly read wilder tales.  It's just that I think the Newford stories work best when grounded in the real world with just a hint of magic lurking about.  Izzy's virtual Goddess condition was a little too far-fetched for the context in which these stories exist.<BR> It's also a little longer than I felt it needed to be, but it was still enjoyable.  If you're looking for an introduction to either de Lint or Newford, I recommend the collection 'Dreams Underfoot' first.	1998-06-14

I'm not one who has trouble separating an author from his characters, but as Card is known for wearing his religious affiliation on his sleeve in his writing, I couldn't help but read a little into the views expressed in this novel.  If you are a practicing witch, this book will only make you angry; I'm not one and it still bothered me.  <br />Aside from this, Card's writing is bland and uninvolving, and the characters are shallow and dull.  I found it barely believable that the villain of the piece would be capable of all she's done, although the way it tied in to an early scene in the story was a welcome surprise.  Unfortunately, there's nothing else very original. <br />As usual, don't read the Kirkus review above, if you are still interested in the book.	1998-04-22

A light and very funny fantasy about a thief, a sorceror, and an enchanted serving set.  The lodge scene later in the book was a bit confusing, with too many characters and not enough identity to them (or at least, not enough time spent to clearly define them in the reader's mind), and I wish more had been revealed about the magical items in question, but otherwise I enjoyed 'Mairelon' a great deal.<br />I think Doctor Who fans might want to check it out as well; the relationship between Mairelon and Kim is a very Doctor/companion-ish one, and Mairelon himself is suitably mysterious, eccentric, and possesses all the other qualities we love the Doctor for.  Think of it as one of his historical adventures, possibly with Paul McGann in the title role.	1998-04-09

In this collection Lucy Taylor achieves something very difficult and presents us with nine very sex-centric tales without ever losing a handle on her plot or characters (something which, say, Poppy Z. Brite has continually failed at.) A woman searches for a lost city of sin; a hitman meets the love of his life - after death; a young man learns the dangers of idol worship backstage at a wrestling tournament; the spell of a forgotten goddess awakens forbidden lust in a bored Greek tourist.  Very explicit (but never gratuitous), often psychological and complex (see the title story) and recommended for the adventurous horror reader.	1998-04-01

As a story, though, it failed to really grab me.  Though the characters are very likable and Rickman gives us a good &quot;feel&quot; for the setting, the plot meandered far too much.  Cut out the by-election subplot (which didn't seem to have any relevance in the end anyway) and the book would have been half as long.  After building up the mystery of Y Groes with hints here and there, we never really learn anything.  Kind of disappointing.	1998-03-28

There's nothing really bad about the stories in this anthology, but there's nothing exceptional or revelatory, either.  One story in particular is kind of old hat (war victims haunting a U.S. soldier).  All but one of the tales are contemporary.

A small Arizona town is torn apart by the arrival of a new mailman.  Sound ridiculous?  Something must have made me pick this book up - the rave reviews, the fact that I have really liked Little's short fiction - but now I can't help but wonder what I was thinking.  This book reads like one of King's weaker, goofier short stories (think &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; or &quot;The Mangler&quot;), except it's long...*too* long.  People receive threatening letters, incriminating photos, but do they do anything about it?  No, they just moan about that darn mailman for 250 pages (the half of the population that is actually smart enough to realize what's going on, that is.)  There isn't even any logic or motive to the things the mailman does, and Little fails to, ah, deliver a satisfying conclusion.  <BR>This book isn't scary; it's laughable.	1998-02-24

Barker explores pleasure and pain and the extent a person will go to for the unltimate experience in this short novel that later became the film 'Hellraiser'.

It mixes gothic horror with both Egyptian and Biblical mythology.<br />  I found it a letdown from the first two installments (DARK DANCE and PERSONAL DARKNESS), which I loved.

I'm not sure what &quot;horror for the next millenium&quot; is supposed to mean; are these destined to be new classics to last us the next thousand years?<BR> A bit presumptuous, maybe, but there is some great work here.  A poet finds a most unusual collaborator in Robert Levy's &quot;Skinwriters&quot;; a teenage girl takes a contemporary disorder to horrifying extremes in Lauren Fitzgerald's &quot;Wasting&quot;; a child's escape fantasy runs out of control in Wayne Allen Sallee's &quot;Soul of the Beast Surrendered&quot;; a girl discovers her underground origins in Caitlin Kiernan's &quot;Tears Seven Times Salt&quot; and Brian McNaughton's Lovecraftian &quot;ystery orm&quot; takes us to the frightening snowbound desolation of a foreign university, where a solitary student receives a warning...but of what?   And honorable mention must go to Edward Lee's &quot;The Stick Woman&quot;, a story of imprisonment and torment which is quite possibly one of the nastiest things I've ever read in my life.  <BR> Unfortunately, most of the second half isn't as impressive as the first.  A few exceptions from David Silva, Jeffrey Osier and Jack Ketchum shine in the midst of a lot of pretty standard material.  Still, it's an anthology worth picking up, as it shows the genre's death has been somewhat exaggerated.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of these wound up in a year-end anthology somewhere.	1998-01-10

Borderlands is a series of horror/dark fantasy/suspense anthologies that attempts to push the boundaries of concept and storytelling.  The first three volumes were overwhelmingly excellent, but this fourth is somewhat of a disappointment.  It simply doesn't possess the power of the earlier material.  It starts off with a fairly strong handful of stories, including some quiet horror from Dennis Etchison, and a wierd tale of a child prisoner by William F. Wu.  Later there are some good stories by William Browning Spencer, David Herter, and James C. Dobbs.  Most of the rest are okay, but not very memorable.  &quot;Monotone&quot; is so poorly written I don't know how any editor continued reading past the first couple lines.  I guessed the &quot;twist&quot; of &quot;The Long Holiday&quot; by the second page; I'm sure it's been done before.  I'd like to see this series continue, but I hope the grade of material returns to its previous greatness.	1997-12-21

'Slippage' is the latest collection of work from someone who is not only one of the greatest writers of short fiction, but also one of the greatest essayists.  These stories have been culled from the pages of F&amp;SF, his &quot;Dream Corridor&quot; comic, as well as some of the best horror and dark fantasy anthologies including 'Midnight Graffiti' and 'Borderlands.'  There is even a script for an episode of the Twilight Zone series that ran in the eighties.  I had read many of these stories before and they did not lose their impact the second time.  Ellison continues to unearth ancient secrets in &quot;Chatting With Anubis,&quot; &quot;Darkness Upon the Face of the Deep,&quot; and the touching and horrific &quot;She's a Young Thing and Cannot Leave Her Mother.&quot;  But the true gem is the novella &quot;Mefisto In Onyx,&quot; about a black telepath who is asked to discover the truth about an accused white serial killer, which has so many twists you'll never guess it's nevertheless perfectly logical conclusion.

Classic King overwriting continues to mar what could have been a decent short novel.  I daresay it all could have fit in two of these little books had they used a more manageable typeface, instead of this large print.  <BR> What bothered me most about this installment was the attempts (failed, in my case) to elicit sympathy for Eduard Delacroix.

Deborah, fifteen, filled with self-loathing and already pregnant, unwilling to be initiated into the family, runs away to make it on her own.  Her adventure is juxtaposed with scenes of life within the werewolf society as they deal with events that may signal the end of their line.<br /> As in her first novel, PRODIGAL, Tem shows her mastery at getting inside her characters' heads - all the more impressive considering these aren't even human.  She believably portrays how the werewolves might observe the human world, the confusion of the city streets, through all their senses.  Yet this novel seems to be too much a simple character study, and I couldn't help but feel there was a lot more story waiting to be told.  There is an ending, but I was left wondering exactly how I got there.  The characters don't change much, and the final events strike the reader as inevitable from the start.<br /> A near miss from a writer whom I will nonetheless still be keeping an eye on.	1997-10-18

Some of it is mildly entertaining, but what's the point of reading an introduction to Mary Gentle's 'Scholars and Soldiers' when few of us (at least in the U.S., sadly) will ever have a chance to read the actual book? <br /> That said, I'd still recommend the collection overall.  My grade of 7 comes from averaging out the good stuff with the filler, so it still comes out on top.  Oh, there are some nice pictures, too..	1997-10-15

Not my usual type of book, but my mom thought I'd like it so I borrowed it from her.  A new doctor at a psych bospital becomes involved in something dangerous when he discovers forbidden experiments being performed on human patients, and with another doctor (read: love interest) decides to do some investigating of his own.  &quot;Kindling&quot; is a method of electrically burning out criminal tendencies in the human brain, but sometimes it has the opposite effect.  Two of the patients, one a serial killer and rapist, the other a once relatively harmless pervert, are somehow freed and embark on a killing spree that culminates in a painfully drawn out showdown in the mountains.<br /> I have to admit, the hero's (and apparently, the author's) pro-animal research stance (he calls animal rights activists &quot;nuts&quot;) put a bad taste in my mouth early on, but it still doesn't affect my opinion of the book as a whole.  It just isn't very well written and the story isn't new or even exciting.  It seemed like something Hollywood would spew out into the multiplex with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the leads.  I know I'm not very experienced in the med thriller genre as far as literature goes, but there's got to be better work out there than this.	1997-10-12
US	52971386	R1BL8O5BYONVN1	0671704184	257613214	Weaveworld	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Made me long for The Books of Blood again.	Barker goes heavy on plot and description, writing with a verbosity I don't remember encountering in his short work, but skimps on the characterisation.  I really didn't care about or feel I knew any of the people in the story.  The wordiness made reading a little tedious and I soon became anxious just to finish the book.  Where Barker excels is in his unique, horrific imagination and there are a few scenes that shine, such as the introduction of the Rake, and the discovery and assault of the Scourge.  But there wasn't enough in here to satisfy me.  I can't recommend either for or against reading 'Weaveworld' as it wasn't *bad*, and apparently a lot of people loved it, but I thought it was just fair.	1997-10-10

I enjoyed the first two books of this series, in fact, I liked the first a lot.  I didn't like the third, but a friend had given me this volume, so thinking it might be different as the &quot;normal&quot; Incarnations were over with, I decided to jump over the intervening novels and read FOR LOVE OF EVIL. <br /> I wish I hadn't.  Though it was better than WITH A TANGLED SKEIN, it was still bad.  Anthony is probably the worst player at &quot;show and tell&quot; out there.  You know, how an author is supposed to show, rather than tell?  He writes as if his readers are idiots.  I nearly lost it when Parry took a swipe at the succubus and his hand got caught in her crotch &lt;!&gt;  He even has to tell us that it's &quot;warm and furry.&quot;  Pleeease.  <br /> I don't know if his writing style had deteriorated by this installment or I simply wasn't aware early on, but by now it had gotten exremely irritating.  The study of evil is inept; I can only imagine what the next chapter (which apparently dealt with God) turned out like.  Fortunately I'll never know.  Avoid!	1997-10-02
US	52971386	R3LE33VDK4TQPO	0684822547	628567784	Exquisite Corpse: A Novel	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Poppy should just take up writing gay porn full time...	...since it seems like that's what she's most interested in.  DRAWING BLOOD started off promising till it turned into an endless series of sex adventures between the two main characters.  Um, could we get back to the *story*, please? <br />        Well, EXQUISITE CORPSE is even worse.  You can't go five pages without one of the characters fantasizing about how he'd love to do one of the others up the rear.  Once again Poppy abandons her story for a lot of homoerotic fantasy that does nothing but bog the book down and take up space.  Such tedium along with a cast of entirely unlikeable characters (another of the author's weaknesses) made the book nearly unreadable for me. <br />       I really liked LOST SOULS a lot and I thought I'd give Brite another chance after being disappointed by her second novel, but I think this is it for me.	1997-08-18
