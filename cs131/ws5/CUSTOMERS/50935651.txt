The very style of it is clearly designed to be read out aloud, with repeated lines varied, like in modern blues, combined with heavily alliteration. <br /> <br />The vigour of this poem, which is four thousand years old, is astonishing. Literally, modern writers could learn a great deal from this long-extinct style of writing.  <br /> <br />My favourite part is where Gilgamesh crosses the ocean at the edge of the world: the poet writes something like: \\"He rowed one mile. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed two miles. And darkness was before him, and darkness was behind him. He rowed three miles...\\" etc. This is magical writing, evoking the style of oral tale-tellers of the time. One gets a real sense of Gilgamesh's trip into the murky and Jungian darkness of the outer ocean. <br /> <br />Also, of course, there is a lot of fine detail of Assyrian life, such as the details of the palaces; also, the mythological monsters are fascinating, such as Humbaba the ogre, who attacks people with somethign called an \\"aura\\", which seems related to later Gnostic ideas about the multi-layered universe.  <br /> <br />To round things off, we get bits of five even more ancient Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh, or Bilgames, as he was then called. These deal with tales that precede the later Epic. I particularly liked the tale of the captured prince who watches out for the attack of his allies that will liberate him and vanquish his captors. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the Epic of Gilagmesh and most of these poems are fragmentary. I'd like to have known what exactly happened to the Scorpion-People that Gilgamesh encounters; or what the nature of the Stony Ones was.  <br /> <br />We will probably find out some day, as there are plenty of tablets either waiting to be excavated, or awaiting study. Unfortunately, many of these tablets, read and unread, were kept in museums in Baghdad.No doubt some shady dealer in antiquities is trying to flog them off even now, unable even to read what he is selling!	2005-03-03

This means that the annotations assume that Sherlock Holmes really existed. This really gets on the nose at times, and I must say I was expecting something far more scholarly (i.e. Sherlock Holmes never existed, people!!) <br /> <br />That aside, the edition is a magnificent one if you can overlook the geeky aspect of it. The quality of the production is fantastic, with very good paper (cream coloured) and two-colour printing which is used to excellent effect. The photos and illustrations include (as far as I can tell), every single one of the Strand Magazine illustrations by Mr Paget, reproduced in stunning detail - I can make out details I never saw in any previous edition!  <br /> <br />The stories are copiously annotated. Sometmes this is fantastically useful in setting the scene in a way that modern audiences might not be able to do. A good example is \\"The Noble Bachelor\\", which has annotations explaining that the Apache attack mentioned in the text was actually a real attack in New Mexico in 1881.  <br /> <br />Alas, sometimes the annotations got a little too precious and \\"cute\\" for this particular reader. An example is Silver Blaze, which has an entire article speculating on whether Sherlock Holmes placed a bet on Silver Blaze's race (groan), while leaving out what I was looking forward to - an explanation of why and in what manner the racing detail in the story is \\"faulty\\" as Conan Doyle famously admitted. I suppose that would require too much \\"reality\\" for the Sherlockian conceit to bear... <br /> <br />Anyone wanting a much more scholarly approach to an annotated Sherlock Holmes would do well to look at the Oxford edition, which is considered definitive by Conan scholars (Although even here the annotators sometimes seem to cross the thin line into pure nerdy fantasy!) However, that edition has no illustrations at all, and is an exceedingly uninspiring and rather drab presentation.  <br /> <br />(By the way - Whatever happened to the Holmesians?? Have their American cousins the Sherlockians completely taken over the field, with their boundless energy and seemingly limitless excess of time on their hands???)	2004-12-29

"Stonewall" Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, Spring 1862	Books	5	34	34	N	N	A Remarkable Book!	<br />I have always been fascinated by the Valley Campaign, and surprised that nothing appeared to have been written specifically on the Campaign itself - at least nothing definitive. <br /> <br />I just knew Tanner's book was what I was looking for, just by the appearance of it. And in fact it is THE definitive account of the Shenandoah Campauign of 1862. <br /> <br />This is a remarkable campaign history. Never does Tanner's pacing seem off. He tells the reader precisely what he or she wishes to know. At proper moments he gives a literary touch to th writing; at other times he tells us what the soldiers were thinking; and at other times he tells amusing anecdotes. <br /> <br />THe sheer amount of research that must have gone into this book is phenomenal. Most books on civil war battles and campaigns tend to rely on accrued secondary evidence, and those pieces of primar evidence that are already widely known. <br /> <br />Tanner, on the other hand, has miraculously discoverd sources NEVER before seen. He is so thorough that the bibliographu and notes take up a seriously large portion of the book. And the information is important - a good deal of it clarifies points that have always been puzzling. For example, he proves that the famous Staunton maneuver, where Jackson seemed to deliberately leave the Valley on foot, only to return by train, was actually ad hoc, and probably not intended. <br />On the other hand, the new evidence regarding the march south from the Battle of Winchester really makes you feel sorry for the Valley soldiers - my feet really almost felt sore even reading about walking that fast, and going without sleep for so long.  <br /> <br />Jackson himself comes across as a flawed genius, which he undoubtedly was. While he was a remarkable soldier, one must admit that there were certain aspects of his character that nearly defeated him on occasion; his almost continuous friction with his subordinates, his extreme strictness, his extreme inflexibility, his religious fervour, his inability to know when his soldiers were past breaking point.  <br />  Yet we also see Jackson's incredible energy, his strategic genius, his unerring instinct for what to do next.  <br />   <br />  Ultimately Tanner's book is about as definitive as a campaign book can get, and is highly recommended to anyone interested in the Civil War.	2004-10-17

The dictionary is incredibly thorough and well-written; but fiercely accurate without any romanticising gloss or faux-biblical style. The text is interpersed with sometimes haunting images from ancient art - such as the Athenian pottery painting showing Heracles journeying across dark oceans in the golden bowl belonging to Helios. <BR>If you are into Greek and Roman mythology (actually it seems the Romans pinched most of their mythology from the Greeks), then here they are in all their primitive glory, local variant stories and all. I find this book especially good for re-reading, with many entries I have never even  heard of.	2004-06-29

An excellent resource for those fascinated by the murky, violent world of American organised crime is Carl Sifakis' Mafia Encyclopedia. The new edition is well-updated (though John Gotti is now dead, and Vinnie the Chin was recently jailed). <BR>Sifakis' book is accurate without being too dull. The Mafia has the potential for humour (albeit rather black humour), as seen in Goodfellas. Sifakis doesn't get as &quot;heavy&quot; as some other books, narrating stories with a real verve - such as his description of Mad Dog Coll whistling when he heard his boss Maranzano was dead!<br />Sifakis' information is very accurate, and is ideal for a crash course in Mafia history and practices. I am a little hesitant about his insistence that the Mafia is flourishing - it's very hard to tell, but I think most people think the Mafia is dying, and no longer able to maintain its old strangeholds.	2004-02-25
US	50935651	RQTH3AWE6XQN7	0394533941	594364058	Napoleon: Abel Gance's Classic Film	Books	5	26	28	N	N	An Amazing Tale	Very few stories of the makings of films can be described as truly dramatic, dramatic enough to form a story worth telling in its own right. Citizen Kane qualifies, as do Platoon and Once Upon a Time in America.<br />But all these very famous stories of dramatic productions pale in comparison to the story of the making - and reconstruction - of Abel Gance's magnificent silent epic Napoleon (1927). Brownlow, who appears to have been the prime mover behind the incredible revival of this film through the late 1970s and early 1980s, tells a story of a film epic that was practically ignored in the hype over the new hi-tech &quot;talkies&quot;.<br />Abel Gance's &quot;Napoleon&quot; suffered indignity after indignity as it was first butchered by money-minded studios in America wanting to suppress foreign creativity, then turned into a patched-up sound film, and finally totally forgotten by all but a very few; the remaining fragments of film rotting in film archives throughout the world.<br />Were it not for young Brownlow's rediscovery of the film in little 9.5mm abridgements in his local store in Englkand, then it is likely that the film &quot;Napoleon&quot; would never have been rediscovered. Thanks to Brownlow's virtual obsession over this film, he broke through all barriers to find more and more of the film, finally being the main force in its reconstruction. Through it all we hear of vast and distasteful conspiracies against Brownlow's work; of archives jealously guarding the remains of the film uintil they literally rot away; of obsessive - and cruel - collectors determined to do the same; of massive commercial intereasts, heartless and money-minded, threatening to strangle the project several times over -  of painstaking restoration with mylar tape and scissors.<br />Beyond that, we hear of triumphs; the exciting discoveries, over and over, of new pieces of film; new sequences whose genius was a little too much for their timel; of the incredible reception the film received in 1981-3 with the new restorations, especially the french restoration of 1982; and above all, the moving reminisces of visiting the aging, seriously embittered, and very egotistical Abel Gance himself!<br />This book is about as dramatic as stories about the making of a film can get. Although Brownlow descends into abject worship fairly often - Abel Gance seems like a rather unpleasant fellow to me - and his obsession sometimes gets a little disturbing and &quot;on the nose&quot;, there can be no doubting his enthusiasm and joy in his task. We feel for him every time he discovers a never-before-seen sequence of incredible genius; or when he finds that a certain hostile collector has let his copy of the film rot to pieces. It is a real adventure story; a story about a film, that goes way, way beyond mere box office receipts and the Hollywood process. This is a real story of guerilla film restoration!<br />Of course, the book also is a wonderful introduction and companion to the film itself - already released on DVD in Australia and England, and shortly to be released on DVD in the US. My own opinion of the film is that it is a film more full of great scenes, than being a great film overall. Not surprising since Gance originally wanted to do a Peter Jackson and film a series of six films simultaneously! This film was only meant as a mere introduction. I also agree with Brownlow that the film's major failing is self-indulgence. Some of the snazzier special effects seem to overshadow the story - again, a bit like Peter Jackson...<br />Please note this; that the versions released on VHS and DVD are NOT the full restorations. The US Coppola Version of 1981 is a rather cut-down version of Brownlow's UK Version. It has also been speeded up to 24 fps, making Napoleon a little jittery. The UK version will probably never be reloeased on video or DVD, which is a terrible pity, even though I like the tinting (well, maybe the red is a little too strong) and the Coppolasoundtrack which are only found on the US version.<br />The real pity is that the SECOND Brownlow restoratioin of 5h 13m, the French version, will probably also never be released This was made shortly after the UK version, with music by Carl Davis. That is a version of Napoleon I would like to see! (though, again, lacking the tinting of the US version.)<br />One final point about the DVD/VHS: the triptychs, which occur at the end, look pretty bad on a TV screen. This is because the only choice is to shrink the image to fit like a &quot;letterbox&quot; image in the screen., Inevitably this damages the impact of the last sequence.oundtrack which are only found on the US version.<br />The real pity is that the SECOND Brownlow restoratioin of 5h 13m, the French version, will probably also never be released This was made shortly after the UK version, with music by Carl Davis.

This is probably the best account of a battle that I've read, along with A Bridge Too Far. The descriptions of the horrors of the Caen battlefield - particularly the Battle of the Falaise Gap - are excellently done. One gets a good feel for small unit tactics in the British Army, especially tank actions. They ought to make a movie out of this!!! <BR>McKee also does not hold back on stories of Allied war crimes, with the English, Canadians and Scottish mistreating and executing prisoners, especially SS-troops. It certainly gives a dark side to the story, especially the Canadians, who seemed to have been especially venegful (many were descended from Frenchmen).

Ever want to know what a British Soldier's cigarette lighter looked like in 1944? - well, you can find that here. Want to know what the cap-badge of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division looked like? You can find a full-colour photograph in here.<br />Volume 2 is a little disappointing. I wasd expecting modern photographs of surviving British tanks, but the book is instead full of black-and-white photgraphs. Layout is much more haphazard and unprofessional than the previous book, with much of the space wasted. This is unlike the previous volume, which was incredibly compressed and filled with information on every page. Given these flaws, it is still useful, especially the section on British armoured formation markings, which is information that is devilishly hard to get hold of. Also the unit formation guides are quite good, if you can get past the excessive colouring-in.<br />Bear in mind that these volumes are hastily translated from the French, and contain many errors. Their layout generally is not very professional.<br />Given all that, these are still valuable books, on a subject that is rarely dealt with. Most such books talk about the German army, never the late-war British.	2003-06-07

Like Julia and \\"The Grasshopper...\\" we are left pondering its true meaning.<br />Consider this: in the novel Abendsen writes his alternate history using the I-Ching. He reaches a result that, although it does not match our reality exactly, is oddly familiar.<BR>In reality PKD used the I-Ching to plot \\"Man in the High Castle.\\" The implication is that TMITHC does not exactly reflect TRUE reality - but it is pretty close.<br />PKD, like Abendsen, ws not really talking about his alternate universe. He is making a bold statement about America in the 1960s. Did the Allies really win the second world war? What benefit was it, if the USA becomes another Nazi Germany? <br />Hitler once said: \\"Even if we cannot destroy our enemies, we can force them to become like us in order to destroy us.\\" PKD often quoted this. He saw it as appalling that the victors over evil in the 1940s could end up plotting to blow each other up in the 1960s. Like Mr Tagomi, we are faced with a feeling of enormous moral outrage. Does it matter who wins, if the extermination of entire nations is even conceived of as realistic policy?<br />Yet PKD also points out how unthinkable life under the Nazis would be. (He is a little soft on the Japanese, in my opinion; just check out their occupation of China. But I digress). PKD's outrage at the Nazis' appalling mental processes (they have wiped out the population of Africa, and don't even care) makes for very interesting reading. He puts into words what many of us cannot - the bizzare feeling that the Nazis were literally inhuman - that ordinary people cannot even begin to comprehend how the Nazi mind operated. It was something at a total remove from ordinary humane thinking - the sheer coldness that PKD was later to call \\"android behaviour.\\" (This would later be studied in the classic \\"Blade Runner\\"). <br />Furthermore, there is the simple visceral pleasure of slowly working out the details of PKD's alternative universe. Churchill still in power in 1962?? F.D. Rooseveldt assassinated in the 1930s?? Hitler dying slowly of syphilis?? This is a history that really might have happened, had the world been less vigilant - and less lucky. In real life, FDR nearly was assassinated - and was saved by his cigarette lighter. History is a mass of chance transformations.<br />Lastly, there is PKd's fascinating ideas about \\"historicity\\" - ideas that are apparent to anyone who owns ancient or historic artefacts. I have some ancient coins in my collection. These coins probably went through the hands of Roman merchants, Roman sailors, even Roman soldiers, senators and noblemen. Yet I cannot shake the feeling that they are just pieces of metal. Where is the historicity in these coins? Only in my mind. PKD plays around with this idea with his notion of a factory turning out fake historical artefacts. <br />The Man in the High Castle may seem disappointing at first reading - but further reading shows the great subtlety in this, one of PKD's masterpieces.	2003-02-04

Yet Gardner has seen fit to put pretentious, geeky, ...pedantic annotations all over it. Now I like nonsense, but the vulgarly rational \\"sense\\" of some of these annotations irritates me. Do we really need to know that the word \\"BOMB\\" begins and ends with B (thereby relating it to the Boojum) and that OM is the Hindu name of God??? Do we really need to know of a political cartoon in which Kruschev says \\"BOO\\", and does Gardner have to tell us that he was trying to say Boojum??<br />Annotations should be done in the manner of Gardner's own annotations of Alice in Wonderland. Now those were annotations that made *sense*. Annotations that simply explained out of date concepts, gave relevant details from Carroll's own life, or obscure humour. That's all! That is what annotations should be like.<br />The pedantic geekery of these annotations remind me of the...games of Star Trek fanatics (or Sherlock Holmes fanatics).<br />The poem is brilliant, though; and the illustrations were funny, before the annotations over-analysed them.	2002-11-07

The book is basically a record of Horwitz's travels through the South (to non-American readers, that is southern USA) and his experiences in seeking out Southerners who remember the American Civil War of 1861-65. <br />Tony Horwitz has described Northerners who have read this book as coming up to him and saying \\"Is it really like that down there?\\" For an Australian, this reaction is multiplied tenfold. Yes, it really is like that \\"down there\\". The whole world has a culture heavily influenced (or, in the case of Australia, practially based on) America's culture. The shock of this book is in discovering a whole other America - an America of which even very many Americans are largely ignorant. The South is like America's subconscious - sort of the same, but with certain underlying peculiarities. Of course, as with any other culture, that of the South is a product of its history.<br />The remembrance of the American Civil War is much stronger in the South than elsewhere in America. By some it is not just remembered but virtually worshipped. Horwitz contacts two types of \\"worshippers\\" in his travels - the benign (and often hilarious) re-enactors or \\"living historians\\", who are largely apolitical; and the exceedingly disturbing groups such as the UDC, who are highly political - they salute the Confederate Third National Flag, (which cannot be changed \\"until the Confederate government reconvenes\\"), teach their children to hate Yankees and to recite Confederate \\"catechisms\\", and above all believe that the Old South was a glorious place where the slaves were loyal and grateful to their masters.<BR>  <BR>It is to Horwitz's credit that he usually stops short of open criticism of such people, or indeed anyone. While his liberal leanings are made clear, he is never openly outraged. His criticisms of the people he meets are subtle, likely to be more ironic than explicit. This is so even when he meets members of the Ku Klux Klan.<br />Above all Horwitz's deep love of the South and its history (he is a Northerner living in Virginia) comes through; and he never treats anyone he meets, or their beliefs, with light dismissal. We feel his horror at seeing the battlefield of Chencellorsville covered with a mini-mall; or Atlanta's bulldozing, and Orwellian suppression, of its antebellum past; or the general soullessness of modern cities compared with the great historical events that once took place there. <br />In a way, the presentation of this alternative America, hiding beneath the surface of the tarmac and strip malls, is strangely comforting sometimes. It indicates the surprising - and rich - alienness that can sometimes lurk even within the dullest facades. And Southern history *is* fascinating.	2002-11-07

The novel depicts colonists on the planet Mars (a thinly disguised analogue for life in 1960s suburbia) who are so bored they have to take a hallucinogenic drug called Can-D to stay sane. Can-D causes a group hallucination in which several persons can participate. However, the titular Mr Eldritch, a drug pusher from outer space, comes to Mars and offers a new and more powerful hallucinogen, Chew-Z.    Palmer Eldritch, a character based on an hallucination that Dick himself once experienced, is a wealthy industrialist with metal eyes, a metal hand and a metal jaw. In character and action he seems to this writer to resemble the \\"crippled man\\" of German expressionist movies and literature; who is himself physically crippled, but has almost a supernatural control over others. Examples of such characters in movies include the Professor in \\"Metropolis\\", the title character in \\"Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari\\", and the title character in Fritz Lang's \\"Dr Mabuse\\" films. More recent examples may include the title character in Kubrick's \\"Dr Strangelove\\", and the stammering, limping Dr Schreber in Alex Proyas' \\"Dark City\\".    The character of Eldritch is the unforgettable centre of the novel, and is truly a terrifying presence.    The effect of Eldritch's drug Chew-Z is to cause the user to enter a hallucinatory reality, apparantly of his or her own choice. However, in these realities the user is alone - no one else can enter their hallucinations except, apparantly, Palmer Eldritch. The contrast between the two drugs may be seen as an analogy of the difference between the \\"soft drug\\" marijuana and the hard drug heroin. While marijuana may be taken in company, heroin is taken alone, and the user becomes withdrawn. (Incidentally, Life Savers recently put out a type of sweet called \\"CHEWZ\\").    The main character, Barney Mayerson, is obsessed with going back to his estranged wife. When he takes Chew-Z, and hallucinates that he goes back to his wife but is rejected, Eldritch reappears and goads him into taking more of the drug to try again, and again, and again. Every time Barney goes back, the universe of the hallucination degrades slightly. Palmer Eldritch begins manifesting himself in the universe. As per the title, the \\"stigmata\\" of Palmer Eldritch - his mechanical parts - begin to appear on other people - even when Barney is supposedly in the 'real\\" world again. This can be seen as an analogy of neurotic or compulsive behaviour, wherein the neurotic, of any kind, is caught in a loop of doing the same unfulfillable action over and over. The neurotic can even be caught in a thought loop, repeating the same fruitless thoughts again and again.    The degrading of Barney's universe is a little like the effects of schizophrenia. At an advanced stage the schizophrenic may be totally locked off from the world. Rather than experience new things in the external world, the schizophrenic may become highly introverted, feeding off his or her own internal \\"world\\" forever. Eventually the internal \\"world\\" becomes more and more degraded, until nothing is left but \\"white noise\\". This conception was explored much more fully in another Dick masterpiece, \\"Martian Timeslip\\".    Meanwhile, a second theme involves the religious analogies of Chew-Z. Dick seems obsessed with the theme of the taking of Chew-Z as being analogous to the partaking of Eucharist by the Catholic. Whereas the flesh of Christ causes the devotee to enter the fellowship of the church and other people, Eldritch's evil Eucharist causes the devotee to become more and more withdrawn from the \\"light\\" of other people.    Added to this is the theme of stigmata. While th development of stigmata among Christians is supposed to reflect the absolute reality of the Christian God, the taker of chew-Z sees the manifestations of Eldritch all over the place - of one man, clearly not God, whose limited and apparently psychotic world view insidiously engulfs the entire universe of the user.    Finally, \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\" can be seen as an analogy of modern life. In the novel's future, while infinite technology has given mankind incredible achievements, its chief net effect has been to make life very dull. Most of the touted \\"high technology\\" created today is literally created to entertain us. How are we much different from a drug user - languishing in dull lives where we work day after day to make enough money to lounge in front of an expensive television on weekends, surrounded by consumer goods? One is perhaps reminded of Sergio Leone's movie, \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\", where the denizens of New York City are depicted spending their hard-earned money in lying about in an opium den watching a shadow play and taking drugs.    Clearly even very rich people are there. Why develop so much technology if it is chiefly used to make us feel pleasure, in a world incresingly sterile and eventless?      \\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\" can undoubtedly be seen as one of Philip K Dick's masterpieces. Indeed, this writer believes it to be his greatest achievement of all. Though it could be said to be poorly written from a technical standpoint, the sheer power of his images and themes is almost overwhelming. It also tends to stay in the mind for a long time.    Philip K Dick is best known for the number of recent movies made from his stories. However, no film has ever been made of this book, even though it seems ideally suited to such a medium. An expressionist style retelling of this tale, even on a low budget, could be very effective.    The book itself is currently very widely available, thanks to an apparant boom in interest in the author. The current printings I am aware of are American paperbacks put out by Vintage and Milennium.    Similar books to \\"Three Stigmata\\" by the same author include \\"Martian Timeslip\\", created the previous year, which explores very similar themes.	2002-09-01

SHUDDER at the scene where Oedipus and Jocasta think they have the prophecy licked, and laugh at the gods!<br />This is fine drama, no mistake. I have not yet read the other two Theban plays in this volume, but I'm sure they're great too.<br />Oh by the way: Australian readers take note. The cover of the Aussie edition has no fewer than EIGHT typing and setting errors! \\"Robert Eagles??\\" \\"Thebian Plays??\\" I see from Amazon that the American edition is corrected.

The problem with Holocaust denial is that it is more religion than history, making convincing them a literally impossible task. <br />Shermer's approach differs from Deborah Lipstadt's, in that he acknowledges that many Holocaust deniers actually do believe the lies they are spouting. Very wise. Unfortunately, he places too much faith on the basic rationality of Denier belief.<br />Hence, he has a large chapter - in fact several - devoted to convincing deniers of the truth. This is, of course, impossible. The only benefit of such an approach would be to convince those who are still unsure as to whether they are \\"true\\" deniers or not.<br />Perhaps Lipstadt's detached approach, aimed not at deniers but academics, is preferable. Because there is no arguing with religious dogma.<br />\\"I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken...\\" <BR>                   - Cromwell.	2002-06-02

Basically, the premise is, \\"what are the philosophical implications if robots became virtually indistinguishable from humans\\"? In 1968, this was a mind-blowingly new idea.<br />The vision of Philip K Dick is absolutely fascinating. For example, in order to maintain the difference between androids/replicants and humans, the government has invented a new religion, based on the idea that killing animals is highly immoral. Yet today we eat animals every day. This belief-system has artificially made a moral code which androids fail to understant. <BR>  It's a little like the blacks after the Civil War - invent white supremacy, disallowing the blacks from making their way in society as normal people - and whites can then point at them and say, AH HAH! I told you blacks need us around to help them! Look how (...) their lives are! OBVIOUSLY they are inferior!<br />Philip K Dick makes many references to the Afro-American experience in this novel, and the theme is most disturbing.<br />There are many, many other, even more interesting, themes in this novel; including those seen in the film. If replicants show more mercy than humans, does this not grant that they have greater \\"empathy\\"? This is a vast theme, and one that is successfully portrayed in the film. Roy Baty has a chance to kill Rick Deckard (in the film), yet he chooses to save him.<br />This novel bears so many re-readings. For instance, yesterday I reread the part where Deckard gives the Voigt-Kampff test to Rachael the replicant (it also appears in the film!) I noticed for the first time, that the questions that Rachael does not react to are the ones concerning killing animals! Again, this is an artificial moral code, so the only reason she feels no \\"empathy\\" to wasps, butterflies etc. is that such moral codes were never natural.<BR>  ALso, she fails to react toa question about killing babies. The reason this is so is that replicants cannot have babies, and so any emotion towards \\"children\\" are denied them...<br />To anyone hesitating before being this book: There are some aspects of this book that may turn one off.<br />First, there is little or no action, and no film noir style. That part (great as it is!) is only in the film version.<br />Secondly, the novel is in Philip K Dick's bizzare, almost childlike style. Do not look for brilliant prose (although there are some gems), or brilliant dialogue.<br />Thirdly, Philip K Dick was desperately poor all his life, and all his books were written VERY fast in order to make enough money to live! Thus, the book is not as well polished as it could be 0- although it's better than some others.<br />Fourth, there are some parts of the book that are - well - strange. VERY strange. Philip K Dick was the master of strangeness. If you prefer books where both feet of reality are kept firmly planted on the ground, this is probably not for you.<br />Fifth, the book is extremely rich in religious imagery, especially towards the end. Although these are my FAVOURITE parts of the book, if you find religion a bore, or disturbing, then maybe this should be given a miss...<br />BUT - if you don't mind your mind being stretched - if you don't mind a rather ropy style - if you LIKE PHILIP K DICK or GREAT GREAT IDEAS - then read \\"Do Androids Dream\\" now!<br />Oh, and by the way, because of Blade Runner the Movie, this book has sold more copies than all PKD's other books put together. It was the event, the film was, that made PKD a name as a great writer - some two months after he died of a stroke...<br />Oh well. Thank you Ridley Scott, and thank you Blade Runner. You have opened PKD's books to a wide, wide audience...	2001-11-16

After reading a few of his works with bemused admiration, this was the first of his books I really enjoyed.<br />SPOILERS<br />A Maze of Death is genuinely readable; most PKD is a little shoddily put together, but this one is perfect. It is a wonderful allegory of loss of faith in God. These people create a world with a virtual reality machine. A world where God exists. The trouble is, when they get out, they can't face reality any more... This is indicative of Dick's own religious confusion at the time - this was prior to his &quot;revelation&quot; of 1974. I can sympathise with him.	2001-06-07

I mean, Christians are still around, and they can get edgy about books like this. But in my opinion, Mack goes to the other extreme. He is known for his slightly radical attitude to Christianity. And this shows through in this book.<br />&quot;The Lost Gospel&quot; is a good read. It is a fine attempt to bring scholarly work on Q to a wider audience. But sadly, as others have said on this site, he is too conclusive in his attitude. Most of the things he says here are exceedingly controversial. Now I am not a Christian; but I can imagine Christians being a little annoyed by this.  For a fuller view of the nature of the controversey...I am afraid the average reader needs to read further. If only the situation was really as simply as Mack claims! Then our job would be easier.<br />But please, don't simply reject books like this out of religious faith.

Not his very best or weirdest ideas...but the quality of the writing is very, very good. One of the rare PKD's with such good writing - most were written in a tearing hurry, with little time for redrafting. <br />For those hesitant to go on to Scanner because it sounds too different from his other work; well, don't hesitate. Scanner Darkly is easy to read, brilliant, frightening and hilarious...all together.<br />One minor problem: er, the death scene of Charles Freck may be hilarious...but has it really got anything to do with the rest of the novel???

The Silmarillion has gained notoriety for its dense, difficult style and huge profusion of names. This reputation has, no doubt, driven away many who would otherwise have tried to read this magnificent work.<br />In contrast to these people, I would just like to say that most of these complaints must be by younger readers of Lord of the Rings. I really believe that the complaints are seriously exaggerated. Any adult should have no problems with this book. It is fairly short, too.<br />I really believe that the Silmarillion is by far Tolkien's greatest work. I don't really like Lord of the Rings that much, to tell the truth. But Silmarillion, with Tolkien's daydreams written down over a period of sixty years, is unforgettable, brilliant and beautiful. <br />In short, it is not as hard to read as people tend to claim. Indeed, it is brilliant and fast-moving.<br />Jonathan	2000-12-28

I think it is her best book. <br />I espceially love the beginning of the book. It is almost ritualstic, like a Japanese dance. Quite unlike, say, Ackroyd or Express.<br />The solution is not a trick (unlike both the previous); and it is based purely on psychology. Very good characterisation, an almost surrealistic atmosphere, and a devious, devious Poirot!<br />The only comparison to this novel is And Then There Were None, which is even more devious, but less of a joy to read.

This is probably Agatha Christies's greatest  novel; and yet there is no trace of Hercule Poirot. The reason for this  becomes clear as you read the novel.<br />Ten uncaught murderers are invited  to a luxury island by the ethereal U.N. Owen. They are all alone.<br />Then  they are murdered, one by one by one by one...until they are all dead. Yes,  ALL.  How, you ask? That's what's so brilliant.<br />Before reading this book  I thought The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was Christie's best mystery. But  unlike that novel, and unlike most of her &quot;great&quot; novels (Orient  Express, Nile), here there is no trick plot. Everything is precisely what  it appears to be. And that's what's brilliant.<br />I can only compare it to a  master conjuring trick, which you can puzzle over forever before it is  finally revealed.<br />The writing quality is also brilliantly atmospheric;  and unusually for Christie, the characters here are unforgettable and  realistic. There is nothing lightweight about this novel - you can tell  Christie really took this one seriously.	2000-09-08

Yet I have to say,  regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly,  overrated.<br />The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely)  grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the  characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.<br />It can't be  that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel  that I have read). It can't be that I am too cynical (I thought The Hobbit  was excellent). It's just that this fat lump of a book is plain poorly  written. Sorry, Tolkien fanatics.	2000-08-31

I hated  it.<br />The second time was last week, at the age of nineteen.  The first  thing I noticed about &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was that, to start with, it  was surprisingly childish. Not surprising, as it is a childrens' story.  However, athough I have never read Lord of theRings, I could sense  something bigger behind the story. It was inexorable. Towards the end of  the story, the tone changes dramaically (around Chapter 14). Quickly, the  language becomes almost biblical in style, eg: &quot;Thorin bent his horn  bow and fired an arrow at Dale; it smote in his shield and stuck there  quivering&quot;.  The juvenile language all but vanishes, and a grand epic  feel is created. The character of Thorin is most memorable.  This is a  masterpiece.	2000-07-08

George Orwell, and many others realised that, if you controlled the thoughts of everyone in the world, then you are literally omnipotent - because nothing  can be proved to exist outside the human consciousness.

I'd read half the novel before realising what was going on...but that's not  the point.<br />It's very difficult to describe why this book is so great.  Strictly speaking, it's not &quot;poetry&quot; or suchlike, it's not the  &quot;originality&quot; of his writing style....<br />  I suppose it could be  described as a sort of Japanese minimalism and American mass consumerism  blend society, which is Gibson's unique vision. <br />Here we don't have  &quot;x flew in spaceship to y, defeats z empire&quot;, but we have the  world we know today, pushed to absolute overdrive. No pristine environment,  or moving descriptions of the peace of space travel - here we have the  dirty, hedonistic, consumerist, urban society we have today, driven by  brandnames, bright lights, and no future; in essence, the Gen X-er's  future.<br />  It's not quite like Blade Runner, where it's a more Film Noir  type city.   Here we have technology used, not to benefit mankind but to  sell to consumers - people who live out their lives as the pawns of  corporations.<br />  There is of course the wonderful descriptions of Virtual  Reality/Internet, where mankind has created a sort of spirit-world, where  depressed outcasts of this society can escape from the &quot;world of  meat&quot;.<br />  I suppose this is why I think Neuromancer is great.	1999-11-12

I like these books a lot.<br /><br />The chief feature distinguishing these three books from the earlier Hitch Hiker books is their infernal complexity. It is almost as if these books are \\"puzzle books\\" where at the end the reader wins a prize for guessing the true meaning of what happened. In order to do so, one has really to read between the lines.<br /><br />One can't really call it \\"deep\\" in the artistic sense (although they are superbly written), but this aspect of Adams' writing style makes these books unusually resilient to re-reading. The disadvantage, now that Adams has made his exit, is that some of these bizarre questions may never be solved. Ever.<br /><br />When I was in high school I puzzled over the scene where a hologram of the Earth turns into a sausage, and then into a string of sausages. One of my friends suggested that it represented the distortion of the Earth as one of its avatars was destroyed in a parallel dimension and the gap filled by a distortion of its neighbours.<br /><br />Another puzzle was whether there is any significance to the fact that the Vogons are grey, not green, in this book. It is remarked on more than once. I recalled a passage in \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" in which Zarniwoop's artificial universe, which is entered by leaving his office by the window, shows green spaceships as grey. Notice that Ford Prefect only sees grey Vogons after jumping out of the window of the same office.<br />In which case, Ford is in a parallel universe during the following portions of the novel.,It is established that arthur goes into a parallel universe every time he jumps into hyperspace. Therefore the meeting with Ford on the sandwich planet takes place when only one possible Arthur happens to bump into the Ford who happens to be in the same universe at the same moment.<br />It doesn't help the Earth, since theEarth is destroyed at the end along every plane of existence.<br /><br />Some mysteries are more recondite, and may only be private jokes.<br />An example: in Mostly Harmless, Arthur Dent lands on a planet called Bartledan where all the books are precisely 100,000 words long. Acting on a hunch, I did a quick calculator check on the probably number of words in the book, and came up with something like 100,240. Obviously a private joke aimed at Adam's frustrated publisher, who probably forced Adams to reach the 100,000 word limit.<br /><br />Of course, simply understanding the ending is dificult. Are we to understand that the Vogons have simply been manipulating Megadodo Publications, to get them (under the name InfiniDim) to produce a device to allow them access to all parallel universes in every possible dimension, simply in order to destroy the Earth along every plane of existence, and make sure Arthur and Trillian are there too? Seems so.	1999-05-14
