It was hard to tell who was speaking in conversations with more than three people. That's an editing error so it's an easy fix and I would never tell anyone to let that keep you away from such a wonderful story.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more adventures set in this universe.	2004-11-09

I'm reading Heat Stroke the second book in what is supposed to be an on going  Weather Warden series by Rachel Caine.  It's an enjoyable rip-snorting summer b-movie sort of read and I'm really enjoying it.  I also liked first book in the series, Ill Wind, a great deal. I'm a weather junkie (How geeky is that!) and surfing the Weather Channel is a guilty pleasure so I especially enjoyed some of the storm manipulation scenes in Ill Wind.<br /><br />There are praise-blurbs from Jim Butcher on he cover and also blurbs comparing the series to Laurell K. Hamilton, but these books are less occult than either of their works and have none of the  graphic sex and gore than the more recent Anita Blake books, although there is a little sex. Caine's style reminds me more of Wen Spencer's alien-wolf-boy detective series than it does of Harry Dresden or Anita Blake.  The smart mouthed no-nonsense first person narrator with a seemingly out of place fixation on muscle cars and designer shoes, reminds me more of the heroines from several sort of post-modern-tounge-in-cheek-thinking-girls romances I've read more than the traditional SF/Fantasy heroine, but that's not bad, she really works in these books.	2004-08-29

It has all the elements a good Arthurian fantasy needs, but for some reason they don't gel.<br />The backstory data-dumps about the villian and the glimpses we see of court life in Camelot are more compelling than the love story between the two main characters. The second half of the book is better than the first, which is very slow, but the ending comes out of thin air.  Where did the heroine learn the spell she uses to save herself? The reader has no reason to believe she has that sort of knowledge.	2004-07-16

Ms Barry seems to be write well, she developes nice tension between her lead characters, but her story would have been more enjoyable if set in an original universe and if she had spent as much time developing the Sci-fi part of her plot as she did on the Romance.<br />As a reader who enjoys a well done Sci-Fi romance novel nothing bothers me more than novels where the writer's experience with Sci-Fi seems limited to media franchise fiction and video games. I wish people who didn't \\"get\\" the Sci-Fi part of the equation would just stick to straight Romance and the ones who want to write media tie-ins would try for the media market.	2003-06-02

To bad that's not the case. This book combines all the worst of really bad series Sci Fi and really brainless Romance. On top of that I found something about the writing style choppy and hard to read. Even the characters internal thoughs seemed stilted and awkward.

I'm a big fan of the hybred genre of Sci/Fi-Romance, but I'll be the first to admit that lots of the &quot;futuristic&quot; or &quot;paranormal&quot; books sold on the Romance side of the isle are so bad that it hurts to read them.  That's not the case with this book.  Ravyn's Flight works, and it works on both levels. It's good light action adventure SF, and good Romance.  I think the secondary characters were way too calm about the strange powers of the Old City and that made the ending a little weak, but overall this book was a great read.  Patti O'Shea goes next to Susan Grant on the short list of people who do SciFi-Romance the way it sould be done. I'll be looking for her next book.<br />Although the writing in Ravyn's Flight is top notch the cover is wretched.  It is overly fluffy headed &quot;romantic bodice ripper&quot; and completely wrong for the book.  It has no connection to the characters or the plot.  In fact the cover was so silly that if I had not heard a bookseller talking about the book I'd have skipped it over as one of those &quot;Futuristic&quot; Romances written by someone who dosen't have a clue. I think the cover is going to loose the book crossover readers from SciFi who would enjoy Ravyn's Flight.  That's too bad.	2003-01-24

I don't really like time travel stories, either in Science Fiction or Romance. They always seem to have some sort of trick or cheat in the plot resolution. Despite that I started reading Ms. Moning's work because she is a local writer and a friend of a friend knew her and recommended her.<br />Her books were a pleasant surprize. Sure there are the expected tricks in the story lines, but I was willing to overlook the time travel tricks because the plots and characters are engaging, and the sex scenes are hot, but not too over the top silly they way they are is so many Romance novels.  Ok, maybe they are over the top silly, but they are so fun you don't care they if they are anatomicaly possible.<br />This is the sort of book that can help you unwind and relax after a stressful day, and forget that you have a whole box of double stuff Oreos in the kitchen calling your name. It's brain candy, but it's brain candy of the best sort.	2002-11-11

It is a blending of fantasy and alturnative universe novel. There is both tecnology and magic in this universe. The book is a weird blend of Law and Order episode and fantasy novel that shouldn't work, but does.  The magical forensics scenes are the best part of the first half of the book.<br />The plots builds slowly  but by the time you get to the end you will be turning the pages as fast as you can read.  There are a few holes in the storyline that it seems a writer of Ms. Duane's skill could have closed(the origin of the madrin for example). These few logic flaws keep the book from being perfect, but they do not ruin it.<br />I would like to see other stories written in this universe and I hope there are more in the works. If you like stories that are a little differnt this book should be on your to be read list.	2002-11-11

It's not a bad book, it's just a very weak book. The characters lack the texture and depth of the people in her previous novels. The plot is not very original or clever.  The world building is incomplete.  This reads like a first draft, not a finished book.	2002-11-06

It was just the thing.<br />Contact is one of those growing number of books that is only shelved in the Romance section because Susan Grant thought of first as a Romance writer. If Contact had been written by someone else it would have been shelved with Science Fiction. That's not to say that there is no romance in the book, there is, lots of it, but there is also action, adventure and intrigue. Unlike so very many para-normal romances this book works on both levels.<br />Ms. Grant has taken advantage of her experience as an airline pilot to create a plot that rings true. The reader feels the heroine, airline co-pilot Jordan's fear and horror when she realizes the plane she is flying has been hijacked.  When the plane's Captain dieds, she steps in and takes control.  She's not wonder woman, it's her job.  The passengers and crew of United Flight 58 refuse to be victims. Even after being told that the Earth has been destroyed and they are the only survivors they don't give up hope.<br />I have to wonder if writing this book in the aftermath of the 911 events was not at least a little cathartic for Ms. Grant. It was great to see everyday people fight back and win.  Whatever the inspiration Contact was a fun read, and I look forward to more great books from Ms. Grant in the future.	2002-10-20

There are some hot sex scenes, but a book needs more than that to get on.<br />To me the biggest problem with the set up is that Ms. Joy does not tell us why a few major things happened. Why did the ship to settle Forus have only women on board? What is the biological change that causes male virginity to be externaly visable? Was that a natural mutation or one caused by the original settlers. There is no explaination for what that change is or how it came about.  Without that the whole rest of the plot is has nothing to hang on.<br />I would also like to know why did the founders of this planet set up such a repressive society? In the society in the book not only men, but non-landed women the majority of the population, would live very hard and limited lives. Regency England seems a very poor choice as the social template for a fresh start on a new world.<br />In addition to this problem Ritual of Proof suffers from a very big case of \\"bad science fiction language\\". It's full of akward words and phrases that distract from the flow of the book rather than add to the atmosphere. I did like tasteslikerooster as an animal name, that was the sort of humor I expect from Ms Joy's books, the rest just made the book a rough read.  Namegiver and namebearer were especially bad.<br />I have greatly enjoyed Ms. Joy's other books but I have to say they this one was a waste of time and money.	2002-07-11

He is the most one of the most interesting characters in contemporarty SF. It has been fun to watch him grow up over the years and come into his own. Ms. Bujold has once again written a witty and fun story with Miles as the star. This book is basically a who done it on a space opera set, like the rest of the book in the series it keeps you amused and turning the pages. Although Miles in now a respectable married government offical in his mid thirties, he still has a few of the bouncing off the walls loose cannon moments that got him into trouble when he was a teenager running coverst ops so secret even he didn't know who was really in charge.  If you have not read any of the Miles Vorkosigan books, you might want to start with on earlier book in the series and not jump in with this book.

This is her second novel and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It is as well writtin as the first and the ideas and plot are just as good, but I really disliked one of the three POV characters and it made it hard for me to relax into the book. I think you were supposed to like the woman, but I'm not sure. I found her abrasive, still that did not keep me from liking this book more than most.<br />How can you not get caught up in a book where the three main characters are  -  A self aware computer program who wants to make a pilgramage to mecca. -The devil, who just want God to admitt that making humans was a mistake.  -And a female Catholic priest who was raised in a Chigago mob family (An interesting character even if I didn't like her as a person).<br />You don't see a plot like that everyday.<br />If you like a little something different in your SF you should love Morehouse. She makes you think, sets cliches on end and entertains all at the same time.	2002-06-18

It may not be quite as good as Dead Untill Dark, but I enjoyed it. The tone of the book is fresh and better than so many of the cookie cutter epics that fill the fantasy shelves these days. I'm a sucker for first person narration and I like Sookie Stackhouse's voice. She is stong, and strait forward without being crude or abrasive. She's not a rocket scientist, and she knows it, but she does not let that stop her.  She is honest, hard working and real.<br />This book and the one before it do invite comparison to the Anita Blake series.  There is a lot that is the same, vampires, murders, shape changers, but Charlane Harris can keep the tension up and the plot going in her books with about half the body count and weird sex.  I'm not a prude, but I like that. The tone of the book is much more like Tanya Huff's Victory Nelson stories, or some of the non-vampire urban fantasy books that I've read, than Hamilton's Anita Blake series.	2002-05-17

Shrinking the Cat is a wonderful little book crammed full of the sort of lucious tidbits of scientific knowlege that I love.  As I read the book I just couldn't wait to work the ideas I was picking up into conversations with my friends. This is one of those books that can make you look at things you already know in a whole new light, and that is a rare thing. I already knew a lot of the facts that Hubbell covered in this book, but I had not looked at them the way Hubbell does. I really enjoyed the way she wove the history of Man's creation of Silkworms, Domestic Cats, and Apples in to a single story tied together the Silk Road linking Asia and Europe.<br />I'm not sure that Hubble really lays to rest the fears that people have about transgenic plant and animals, but she does a very good job of showing how in many ways we have always lived in a world created by human hands, and that shaping the world is the basic and defining thing that make us human.	2002-04-08

This is not a bad book.  It may not be on a level with Cherryh's best work, but it is a good read.  Cherryh is know for her complex plots, and well drawn aliens, this book does not have either but it does not miss them. It is a simple straight forward story with a simple almost everyman hero. It pulls you into it's world and makes you care what happens next. It was a nice change of pace from the huge complex multi volume sagas that seem to be dominating the genera lately.	2002-03-14

The publisher really [messed]... up by blowing what should have been the big secret of the novel on the cover blurb and letting the reader know that there are still humans alive on the 2nd Station.  Starting the book already knowing that fact put the reader in an akward position reguarding the plot.<br />Defender is not up to the high standards of the previous books in the Foreigner series. There is a feeling here that the Characters, and maybe the author, are treading water.  Still Cherryh treading water is better that a lot of other writers on their best day. I hope this does not mean that Ms. Cherryh is loosing interest in this universe. I'll be interested to see where the story goes from here.	2001-12-31

I has heard good things about this book and I had looked forward to reading it. I was a little disappointed.<br />This book has all the texture and flash but seems to be missing something at its heart. I'm not sure quite what. It does have it's high points.  The descriptions are lush and you have no trouble seeing this world. The characters are interesting and eclectic, my favorite is Phasia.<br />The problem with this book was that the plot was a bit murky. Things happened, interesting things happened, then something else happenes, but the thread that should link everything together and push the plot along is missing. It is like watching scenes form a movie, but not the whole movie.  The backstory was just not as tight as it should have been. I was never sure why the border style in this book came from an old gangster movie. The one time this is brought up in the book I was not satisfied with the answer.  Also the sub plot where Doc has to learn to accept his true inner self is so subtle it's confusing.  I'm not saying don't to read this book, but get it from the library and save your money for a better book.	2001-07-06

This is not the sort of Sci-Fi that is going to change your out look on life, it may not win any awards, but it is exactly the sort of book that got me hooked on the genera.  This book has everything you might want in a Space Opera, action, adventure, mysterious aliens, High Tech spaceships, political intrigue, an exotic hero and a splash of romance.<br />This is Ms. Czerneda's fifth book and her best yet. The plot and settings in the book are handled well, the pacing is good and the images are fresh and interesting, but all that takes second place to the people. Ms. Czerneda's strength as a writer is her characters.  She manages to breath life into people who would cardboard cutouts in most other writers hands. In fact the extras in all her books sometimes stick with you more than her heroes.  In this book Malley and FD Commander Grant are both more interesting people than the &quot;hero&quot; Pardell. About the only complaint I have for Ms. Czerneda's books as a whole is that her male leads are maybe just a bit too strong and silent. But don't let that keep you away from her writing.<br />In The Company of Others is not a perfect book, there are a few holes in the plot, the romance is a bit hokey, the ending is a little wistful, but it is the sort book that you regret finishing. It leaves you wanting more of the same.	2001-06-29

If for some unfathomable reason William Gibson and Andrew Greeley co-wrote a book and took a few plot suggestions from Nora Roberts, that book might have turned out like Archangel Protocol. There is a dark dis-utopian future. Government is a Theocracy. Citizenship is controlled by access to a cyber world called the Link. The Link may be haunted by Angels.  The hero is an excommunicated Irish Catholic Cop with good soul and lost faith. There are a whole flock of ethnically diverse Angels who use multiple and revolving pronouns when they talk about God. To top everything off there is a nice romantic subplot.<br />None of this should work together, but it does. Wonderfully. Morehouse has woven all these elements with a deft hand. This is a novel where the action never stops, but at the same time she has characters who are more than cardboard and even tosses in some ideas for you to think about.<br />As I neared the end of the book I found my self in the reader's dilemma of wanting to read slowly so it would last longer and at the same time unable to slow down because I wanted to see how it was going to end.  I definitely am putting Morehouse on my list of authors to watch for.	2001-06-06

The books are an equal blend of good old wiz-bang space opera and romance. I think that this book like the rest of the series will appeal mostly to women, but if you are not a Romance fan do not let that keep you away. This book owes more to books like White's Sector General series as it does to the world of bodice rippers.<br />&quot;Endurance&quot; is the third installment in the adventures of Cherijo Grey Veil, genetic construct and intersteller surgon. The book starts right where the last one ended and it ends with a cliff hanger of its own, but don't let that put you off because there is enough action in this book that it will leave you wanting more.<br />The only flaw in the book is that it becomes harder and harder to believe that someone as smart and savy as Cherijo could be as stupid about men as she is. I think that Ms. Viel still has cards to play in the increasingly disfunctional relationship between Cherijo and Duncan Reever the series hero/villain/general mystery man, and I hope she playes them soon or that relationship will begin to get old.  At this point you are still rooting for them to get together, but their chance of happiness seems dim through most of this book, at least untill the ending.	2001-01-23

At the heart of this book is the relationship between Esen Alt Quar, a 500  year old shape changing being and Paul Ragem, a human male. This might make  your want to put this book with the SciFi novels that are really romance  novels in SciFi costumes.  That would be a big mistake. Although  &quot;Changing Visions&quot; is personality driven it is also a first class  space opera full of interesting aliens, plot twists, and wonderful  characters.<br />Ms.Chzernda shows how immage effects the way we react to an  individual by showing how various caracters, who know Esen's secret, react  differently to her as she changes form.  At the same time she exlores how  biology influences personality as Esen's physical forms effect how she  reacts to each new situation. Then there is the problems that arise from  the differences in the life span of the main charactes.  As the plot twists  throught a series of adventures that could be labeled 'the perils of Esen'  you come to realise that Paul and Esen are not suffering from unrequinted  love, but a bound by much ties that are deeper and truer than that.  I  particularly like Paul'd &quot;It takes a villiage...&quot; answer to the  problem, even though Esen resents his solution.<br />The cliff hanger last  chapter leaves not doubt that there will be more adventurs ahead for Esen  and her Web.

Marsh and the Rise of American Science	Books	5	5	5	N	N	There's nothing like a good rivalry	The heart of the book is the war of words between E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh. These two men were the top paleontologists of their day and were among the first scientists to do serious scientific studies in the American West, they also hated each other. The accouts of their expiditions in the 1860's and 1870 are as exciting as any western. One of the expiditions was working in the little Big Horn area at the time of Custer's last stand. At that time Paleontology was the hot new science, the way cloning and genetics aretoday. Darwin's theory of evolution had only recently published. America was trying to recover forn the Civil War. A large part of the American identity was wrapped up in the West. The fantastic fossils that were being found there were something America had that Europe did not and therefor important to the American public.<br />In addition to enduring the hardship of field collecting Cope, Marsh, and their contemporaies were inventing modern science as we know it.  They also were building the univerities and museums, (Yale, Harvard, The Smithsonian) that would become the breeding grounds for the educated scientific community in America. Jaffe has a sort of 'Ken Burnes\\" style with lots of excerpts from letters that really makes the material come alive. I'd say anyone who has more than a passing interest in paleontology would enjoy this book, but so would any one who is interested in the history of American Science.	2000-07-12

It does get just a little but much that  Asa Frost is able to always pull his bacon out of the fire at the very last  moment, but it is in keeping with the pulp adventure flavor of the  book.<br />I like May's more serious work much better, and I would like to see  more of it, but this book is not a bad for light summer escape reading.	2000-06-15

I don't mean it is not a good  book,  but it is a harsher and less comfortable book.<br />It is hard to  really like either of the two central characters. Berk Nielsen is self  centered and immature,despite having been raised with the world at his  feet. Sadonya is self centerd and immature, but she is 13 and has raised  her self in the middle of a constant gang war.  These two do not even like  each other.  The only thing that unites them when they are forced together  is the feeling that they deserve better, and the sheer willpower to rip  life out of the tangled hell of a post apocolyptic future.<br />The main  narritive of this book deals with helecopter pilot Berk's quest to find  himself, or to at least make a name for him self, so he can keep flying and  not get a &quot;real&quot; job. Berk's life is set against a really well  visualized post-ecocolapse east cost. Wood creatively blends some standards  from the 'end of the world' genera and tells a good story. You like, and  even feel sorry for, Berk at the beginging of the book.  As the story  progressed be become less and less likeable, when forced to survive in the  wilds he can, but he looses his a little bet of his soul to do it. He  realizes this, and does not seem to care. Contrasted to &quot;The  Brethern&quot; who live in the harshed part of the outside and yet are  humanity at it's best he looks especially bad.<br />This book does not have  the romace subtext that helped make &quot;Looking for the Mandi&quot; so  fun. It could have used something like that to soften and humanise its  characters. It also has an unexpectedly bleek ending, but that may be part  of the point of the book.<br />As a Queen City native I was happy to see that  for once our city fathers planned ahead. In this book Cicninnati survives  the end of life as we know itnd of life as we know it	2000-06-14

Despite the &quot;modern&quot; trammings of an independant AI and a genetically enhanced character, it is basically an old fasioned Space Opera.  The book starts out like gang-busters drags just a  little in the middle, then gets you back on your toes with plot twists at  the end. This is not the kind of SF that will change your view of the  universe, but it is better than any thing on TV and makes a great stress  reducing escape.	2000-06-05

It also  has a less ensemble cast of characters, but that just makes the action go  even faster. The first person narratior is the sort of laid back hapless  hero that you can't help but like and the plot has plenty of twists and  turns to keep you awake.<br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.	2000-04-26

The &quot;Foreigner&quot; series is as good as it gets in my opinion and each book has been better that the last. They also get better each time I read them<br />I love the  political intrigue.  I love the fact that the humans are the alien  invaders. I love the fact 9 times out of 10 humans and atevi minds get to  the same place bu different routs, but on that 10th time, watch out. Lastly  I really love Bren's crazy neurotic mother and all the other family trama  he has to deal with while he is also tryin gto save the world, that adds a  dose of reality to the series. You and pick your friends, but not your  family.<br />Cherryh's best characters are those who are in the process of  transforming their souls. Bren thinks he has had to trade bits of his human  soul to do his job of standing between Humans and Atevi, but he is not  becoming less human as he fears, nor is he becoming Atevi as his critics on  Mospheira claim, he is becoming something completely new the Paidhi for the  entire planet.<br />I can't wait to see what happens next.	2000-02-16

I had read her earlier fantasy series and thought they were ok, but nothing to write home about. Ove the holidays I picked up Once A Hero on a  wim and I was hooked her Familias Regnant series.  I do love a good Space  Opera and this is one of the better ones going.  I will admit that Change  of Command does have a tendancy to suddenly grow subplots, but I found  myself getting sucked into them and only being anoyed later that the main  plot was crawling along.  How can you not love the brassy big haired Lone  Star ranger? I'd like to read a book about her case file. I'll be browsing  my local bookstores for Ms. Moon's next book.  I think she is going  someplace fun with the loose ends at the end of this one.	2000-02-01

I have to admitt that the Star Trek book are a guilty pleasure.  They are to real science fiction  what grocery store romances are to real literature, Cheap and easy fun.  I think I have enjoyed the &quot;New Frontier&quot; books especially because they stand on their own and have  never been on video.  I also like the fact that they are  maybe a little  less spit and polish than the rest of statfleet.<br />I do have one bone to  pick with this book though.  It's been a while since I read #6 but I  thought Soleta found out she was pregnent at the end of #6.  Now I know  that Vulcans are supposed to be focused and logical, but shouldn't it have  at least been alluded to in this book?  It's not the sort of thing you can  put a shelf until it fits into your schedule.	2000-02-01

Sorry but it's the truth. This book, like &quot;Changer&quot; befor it was a breath of fresh air.  It playes with themes from mythology without ever becoming cute or tired .  Lindskold tips your expectations around and plays with the archetypes of  the genera. These two books remind me a bit of Sharon Shin's  &quot;Archangel&quot; book in the way they turn old ideas on their ears.<br /> Lindskold weaves her imortals into todays world and leaves you wanting  more. After reading this book I want to know more about Nigeria. Some of  the facts I found out about AIDS in that part of the world when I did a  little looking made me wish there were some imortal gardians looking to  help their people.<br />  I like a book that takes me totally away from the  tials of my everyday life, and amuses me.  If it makes me think a little  that is even better. I can't wait for Lindskold's next Athanor book.	2000-01-26
