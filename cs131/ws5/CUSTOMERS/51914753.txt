It quite simply is a unique collection of fascinating facts all printed on bright pink paper which tells you about the first openly gay politician to be elected to office, books written by gay authors, as well as books about the LGBT scene and a look at the first lesbian soap opera character, along with many other interesting facts, figures and hot gossip that is often hilariliously funny and tragically poignant in the same breath.<br /><br />I got this book on one of my thrift shop hunts and I bought it just on spec, and I was totally fascinated and really enjoyed the whole book from cover to cover.<br /><br />Not overly explicit by my standards but it could offend those who hold deeply religious views but then it very much a book for those who know, love and are part of the LGBT scene.<br /><br />Am I part of that scene?

It is obvious from the way she writes that she is remembering every moment of that terrible incident.<br /><br />Despite all of this horror she seems to get used to sending young men back home minus limbs or their minds or in body bags and she gets on with her job of being a nurse.<br /><br />Interspersed in all of this is her innocence that is slowly but surely eroded by war and its indifferent cruelties, I laughed out loud when I read a section where she has to be told what \\"condom\\" is at the ripe old age of 22, Winnie grew up in Vietnam, came of age as did many of her counterparts but as woman she was never to be counted as one of the \\"survivors\\" of the Vietnam war.<br /><br />Winnie is as much a causality of the war as the men she has helped put back together or sent home in a casket.  She doesn't realise this until she is sent stateside and only then does the real horror begin, she has to come to terms with what she has seen and been through.<br /><br />This is not a sentimental read, it is abrasive, harsh and mind numbing but it is also gives a real insight to the \\"other side\\" of war, of what it was like to be a Nurse looking after the soldiers wounded in battle.<br /><br />Despite having a loving family at home Winnie is never able to make them understand what it was \\"truly like\\" in Vietnam but if Winnie is anything she is a survivor and in the end she comes to terms with her being a \\"Vietnam Vet\\" and gets on with her life, scarred, battle weary but totally and utterly a survivor.nd been through. <br /> <br />This is not a sentimental read, it is abrasive, harsh and mind numbing but it is also gives a real insight to the \\"other side\\" of war, of what it was like to be a Nurse looking after the soldiers wounded in battle. <br /> <br />Despite having a loving family at home Winnie is never able to make them understand what it was \\"truly like\\" in Vietnam but if Winnie is anything she is a survivor and in the end she comes to terms with her being a \\"Vietnam Vet\\" and gets on with her life, scarred, battle weary but totally and utterly a survivor.	2005-08-24

It's not a feel good book in any sense of the word.<br /><br />The author is aware that she she still is a prisoner to her illness but what she has done is come to terms with it; Anorexia and Bulimia are still millstones around her neck but this book is her way of dealing with this burden.<br /><br />Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia by Marya Hornbacher is not an easy book to read, not because the author makes the subject she is talking about complex, rather it is a brutally honest picture into a life governed by eating, puking, starving, eating, starving, puking, a vicious in which there seems to be no escape.<br /><br />The author looks carefully into her childhood, her teenage years, her adult life, her relationship with her volatile family, her own detachment from herself as a woman in a man's world.<br /><br />I couldn't read this book in one sitting, I had to do it in stages, it is powerful stuff, I have an eating disorder, and I can relate to some of the thing Marya is saying, especially about how you fit your sickness to suit your life and how you learn to be devious, to hide if from those around you, how the lies you tell are lies that you want to believe and so they become the truth.<br /><br />This is another book that we should give teenage girls to read because I think that it just might sway some of them from taking the road that Marya took and barely survived going down.<br /><br />An incredible, disgusting, compulsive, painful, and totally addictive read about a subject most of us would rather avoid if we could.	2005-06-11

Paul McKenna is not a miracle worker when it comes to \\"making people thin\\", in fact it's not so much \\"him\\" making you t thin as yourself making yourself thin with the power of the mind.<br /><br />The accompanying CD was a good idea too, easy to listen to and subliminal so that it can work on you on a subconscious and conscious level.<br /><br />The book is a good read only seven short chapters long, with tips on how to control those \\"mad food cravings\\" you get now and again even when you're not dieting, and a good FAQ section to dip into when the need arises, so all in all it's a pretty good \\"self-help\\" book that won't go amiss on any bookshelf, even mine, and that is saying something as I am a jaded cynic when it comes any sort of book to do with weight loss.<br /><br />Personally I am sick to death of these \\"LET'S HELP YOU FATTIES LOOSE WEIGHT\\" kind of books, you've seen them in every bookstore you have ever visited with titles and promises like \\"Eat TONS of pineapple and you too will get that scrawny starved look you SO desire\\" or \\"Dr Atkins says, greasy food will make you thin AND happy!\\" or my all time favourite, \\"These exercise bikes work like magic, just buy this $2,000 magic machine to get your ABS in shape and then starve to death `cos you can't afford groceries!\\"<br /><br />At least this book doesn't tell you WHAT to eat, that is up to you, what it does do is help your mind to look after your body, the rest then is up to you which I guess is all you can ask for in the end and though I still struggle to see the end of the rainbow, I have a binge eating disorder, at least I have found a book that gives me hope if not all the answers and cures I am looking for.	2005-03-28

If we want to take Global Warming seriously then reading a book like this is tantamount to reading a book on plumbing and its many uses in the drainage system of life.<br /><br />Come on guys, this is a FICTION book, i.e. it's not laying claim to be the truth as we know it, if you want to read a book like that, then LOOK somewhere else!<br /><br />I read this book, and I read it for what it was, a book of fiction, with fictitious characters going through a fictitious scenario.<br /><br />It wasn't the most brilliant read I have ever come across but let me tell you it certainly is not the worst!<br /><br />The book did give more insight to some of the lesser characters in the movie, and I actually appreciated that, and it pretty much followed the movie in every other way too which was fine by me.<br /><br />As for the reality of Global Warming, it scares the pants off of me, and should do the same for everyone else, however in the case of the book, \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" we should look at it with the eyes of wisdom and know that this is not how it will be if the big freeze happens, there will fewer survivors that is for sure, at least for those of us on the surface, those who have access to nice bunkers deep in the warm earth, well, they will be okay, but the world they know and remembered will go the way of the Dinosaurs and they will have to start all over again.<br /><br />I only hope that whatever is left of humanity if they get that tiny second chance, they don't make the same mistakes as we are making right now.<br /><br />I don't know about you guys but all I ask for is to be with my family when the \\"big freeze\\" comes around, (if it comes around in my lifetime, you never know!) at least we will all go together and you can't ask more than that can you?	2005-03-27
US	51914753	R1H28HBUS44MQX	0312302487	573239732	The Character of Rain: A Novel	Books	5	2	3	N	N	The Character of Rain, the Character of God	The translation of this book into English has been done extraordinarily well and there is seemingly no loss of nuance and feeling in the strangely compelling storyline.<br /><br />The child protagonist is a mere tot when she starts to tell her story but in the beginning we are treated to her creation when she was a \\"tube\\" \\"a plant\\" \\"a vegetable\\" bought into life by sweet white chocolate and her Belgian Grandmother's hand.  Now we all know the best chocolate comes from Belgian and whether the author meant us to realise this (somehow I think she did) we are drawn into the strange world of a child who has the mind of a little God but has the body of a baby girl.  She can talk before she is two years old but for a long time she hides it from her family, but fluently speaks Japanese to her favourite Nanny Nishio-San whose simple outlook on life lets her accept without real question this anomaly.<br /><br />At first the characters in the book are one dimensional, the \\"little God's\\" parents and older siblings nothing more than card-board cut-outs but slowly with the turning of each page, everyone gradually comes to life, the two Japanese Nanny's are my favourite characters, one good and loving toward the \\"little God\\", the other arrogant and contemptuous of her European ward, all in all a complex relationship between various people and various levels of the mind.<br /><br />The book ends with the \\"little God\\" making a serious attempt to take her own life, she wants to die, and she wants to leave the world before she looses all her \\"Godhead,\\" but she is saved and in being saved she is lost.<br /><br />This is a kind of Paradise Lost for the modern world and I would highly recommend it but only for those readers who like to read strange books like myself.	2005-03-27

Like most people I've seen the movie with Michael Caine and Julie Walters but I wanted to see what they \\"play\\" version was like with only \\"Rita\\" and \\"Frank\\" seen at any given moment.<br /><br />It is actually quite enlightening, the discourse is perky and colourful and the other characters we verbally \\"meet\\" in the play are only one dimensional in the sense they are talked about but never seen by the audience.  However this does not make them any less real and we soon start to believe in their existence even though we never get to see them in the flesh.<br /><br />This particular Longman book is quite good in that it gives a sturdy and interesting preface from Willy Russell himself, along with a fairly comprehensive glossary at the end and a reasonable study programme, rather basic if you are a graduate student but still useful for anyone who is a literature buff, be they beginner or expert.<br /><br />Not bad for a book that cost less than a dollar is all I can say!	2005-03-27

she had not \\"come into her power\\" as others in the Unseelie Court had done and each dual she had to fight was dual that bought her closer to death so she fled, hiding among the mortals that she could mimic because of her own human ancestry.<br /><br />However, Meredith's cover is about to be blown when a case she is involved in drags her back into her Aunt's fey sights, along with her hated cousin Cel the Queen's spoilt son who desires her death, and the protection of the Queen's bodyguards who have been denied sexual release for nearly a 1,000 years.<br /><br />There is nothing sweet about the \\"magical\\" characters in this book, Goblins are sex obsessed and violent, faeries are vicious blood sucking miniature vampires, Brownies are good but without power, and Elves don't just have pointy ears look beautiful, they are vicious as the next person in either of the Court's they live.<br /><br />The Seelie and Unseelie Court is complex and their links to each other can be described as Night and Day.<br /><br />Among all of this you have the Slaugh, ones who can be called to do the bidding of the feared Queen Andais and it is Sholto, of the Slaugh who has been sent after Meredith and he is a creature that all fear, perhaps even the Queen herself.<br /><br />The story is rich with nuance, complex and spelling binding (forgive the unintentional pun here) and Ms Hamilton manages to keep a good hand on each character so we know just who is who.<br /><br />There are many wonderful scenes in this the first book about Meredith Gentry and my favourite is with Rowan, a Selkie (and Meredith's lover) who has lost his skin, and the only half seal half man to survive it, for the seal skin is part of the person and the creature of the sea and Rowan wears the burns on his back.<br /><br />However Meredith is far more powerful that she gives herself credit for and the scene in which she \\"gives\\" Rowan back what was taken from him is actually quite beautifully written, and the story just gets better and better from then on.<br /><br />I won't say this book is easy to read, the characters are many and complex, the world that has been created is grafted on to the real that we know, and the strangeness of the few mingles with the familiarity of named places and human vices that we are all so aware of.<br /><br />All in all in all this is a hot, sexy read that is surprisingly intelligent, and fun to read too, a rare commodity today when pretension is the name of the game in the literary world at the moment.y are vicious as the next person in either of the Court's they live. <br /> <br />The Seelie and Unseelie Court is complex and their links to each other can be described as Night and Day. <br /> <br />Among all of this you have the Slaugh, ones who can be called to do the bidding of the feared Queen Andais and it is Sholto, of the Slaugh who has been sent after Meredith and he is a creature that all fear, perhaps even the Queen herself. <br /> <br />The story is rich with nuance, complex and spelling binding (forgive the unintentional pun here) and Ms Hamilton manages to keep a good hand on each character so we know just who is who. <br /> <br />There are many wonderful scenes in this the first book about Meredith Gentry and my favourite is with Rowan, a Selkie (and Meredith's lover) who has lost his skin, and the only half seal half man to survive it, for the seal skin is part of the person and the creature of the sea and Rowan wears the burns on his back. <br /> <br />However Meredith is far more powerful that she gives herself credit for and the scene in which she \\"gives\\" Rowan back what was taken from him is actually quite beautifully written, and the story just gets better and better from then on. <br /> <br />I won't say this book is easy to read, the characters are many and complex, the world that has been created is grafted on to the real that we know, and the strangeness of the few mingles with the familiarity of named places and human vices that we are all so aware of. <br /> <br />All in all in all this is a hot, sexy read that is surprisingly intelligent, and fun to read too, a rare commodity today when pretension is the name of the game in the literary world at the moment.	2005-02-20

By writing this book, Lawrence has blown off the doors so to speak, even in this the first and mildest of his three attempts at Lady Chatterley's Lover.<br /><br />It's best to read all three of these books, for each is quite distinct, quite different from the other in a variety of ways from plot, to characters, to scenery.<br /><br />My favourite Lawrence book is \\"The Virgin and the Gypsy,\\" but \\"The First Lady Chatterley\\" has a special place in my heart for its pastoral quality combined with the biting potential of human sexuality waiting to be unfretted in future editions.	2005-01-16

Sally Hemmings was his wife's half sister, and probably looked a lot like her, I leave the rest to your imagination plus the fact only Sally and her children were freed upon Thomas Jefferson's death, and also the fact that<br />Sally followed Thomas Jefferson back to the USA when she could have stayed in Paris a free woman of colour.<br /><br />All of this is expressed in this wonderful book that should be on the shelf of every school in the USA.<br /><br />I just wish we had books like this in England because we too have a secret history like the Hemmings and Jefferson relationship, born from Britain's colonisation of Africa, India and the Caribbean, we too have a legacy that needs to be told and perhaps one day it will be.in Paris a free woman of colour.

It was in the sale and I thought, \\"What the heck, I've nothing else to read tonight!\\"<br />The author Albert DeMeo pulls no punches as he chronicles not only his father's life, the Mobster Roy DeMeo and his steady rise to power in the Mafia in New York but also his own involvement from the tender age of five in a world that was seductively charming as it was dangerous.  \\"For the Sins of my Father\\" is a brutal, candid, violent, tender portrayal of a life in a huge glass bubble in which escape is not an option for anyone.<br />However Albert DeMeo is not an apologist for his father's actions, rather he pulls the reader in a world in which corruption is at the heart of everything.  Just as you can't feel sorry Roy DeMeo for the choices he made in his life you also cannot feel anything for the Police, the FBI, the Government, the Court system because they were often as corrupt as the people they claimed they were trying to bring to justice.<br />Albert's father knew many people and many considered themselves law abiding whilst at the same time asking and getting favours from the Mafia Capo who was their \\"neighbour\\" and \\"friend\\".<br />In one chapter the young Albert helps his father's \\"crew\\" to work out how wipe clean some audio tapes that could send one of their members to jail; magnets the child tells them men can wipe clean magnetic tapes of all their contents.  It is a corrupt police officer who puts a magnet next to the audio tapes so that they will be blank when they are played in court.<br />It is also to Mafia owned drinking dens that many court officials, police officers and other city officials attend to drink, buy drugs and enjoy the company of Prostitutes.<br />Roy DeMeo's murder in the early 1980s is a brutal wake up call for the teenage Albert and hounded by both the Mafia who want his silence and the FBI wanting him to turn State's evidence, Albert somehow manages to salvage his life out of the wreckage of violence his father has left behind.<br />This is not a fairy tale, there is certainly no happy ending but Albert DeMeo is living proof that you can walk a way from organised crime and go on to live a legitimate life, all it takes is a lot of courage, the memory of how your father, a man you loved beyond all words, died in a hail of bullets, murdered by the very people who were supposed to be his friends and associates.<br />This book is very different from the gratuitous Best Seller \\"The Murder Machine\\" which demonises Albert's father; this is a book that puts a life into perspective, warts and all.  Violence, car crime, prostitution, gambling, protection rackets, corrupt officials, loan sharking, pornography are put on display and it is left up to the reader to judge where the line between right and wrong lies.<br />There is no moving away from the fact that Roy DeMeo was a murderer, a Mafia Capo and a man with a criminal mind, but the world he worked in was a world providing services and commodities that people wanted and even the law was not above the stench of death, and corruption.<br />Read this book with an open mind and remember a father's love can transcend even the most vile of crimes....olence his father has left behind.<br />This is not a fairy tale, there is certainly no happy ending but Albert DeMeo is living proof that you can walk a way from organised crime and go on to live a legitimate life, all it takes is a lot of courage, the memory of how your father, a man you loved beyond all words, died in a hail of bullets, murdered by the very people who were supposed to be his friends and associates.<br />This book is very different from the gratuitous Best Seller \\"The Murder Machine\\" which demonises Albert's father; this is a book that puts a life into perspective, warts and all.

I'm lucky that the copy of audio tape that I have has Derek Jacobi as the reader.  He played Brother Cadfael in the recent TV series.<br />\\"The Light on the Road to Woodstock \\"is a prequel in that it tells the story of how Brother Cadfael ended up as a monk in the Abbey of Shrewsbury.<br />Cadfael is introduced in this story as a soldier for hire heading back from Normandy in 1140 AD in the employ of an arrogant and much disliked English Baron.<br />Cadfael has yet to become a Monk; he is at a Crossroads in his life and does not know what he will do once his service with the Baron ends.<br />In his company is a renegade monk, Alard who fled his monkish lifestyle when he was 15 years old and he is now hankering after his old life in Evesham.  Together they accompany their Baron employer who has kept them on until he has completed some legal business in Shrewsbury.<br />It is from this point we are pulled into an intriguing mystery that includes a kidnapped Abbey Prior and a disputed Manor and village at the centre of it.  Cadfael uses his shrewd understanding of human nature to unravel the clues and get to the bottom of the whole sorry business and along the way we are treated to a satisfying twist in the tale.<br />A great prequel well worth listening to as it gives many snippets of information about Cadfael's early life before he became a monk of Shrewsbury.	2004-06-05

It is about a grotesque man, Fred West and his equally grotesque wife Rosemary West, two serial killers born and bred in the UK.<br />Fred and Rosemary West will long be remembered for their systematic abuse (and murder) of their own children (and others) and how, for many years they evaded being discovered because of the indifferent society they lived in.<br />Gordon Burn takes his readers into a modern day Heart of Darkness in which there is no happy ending, only survivors who will never be the same again.<br />This is not an easy book to read, it starts in a peculiar way, far removed from the West family themselves, in a way it is quite detached from Fred and Rosemary, and I think the author did this on purpose.<br /><br />Instead the book looks at the lives of people who at first seem to have nothing to do with the storyline, but then the threads are carefully drawn in, showing the connections to Fred and Rosemary West and how evil can spread its tentacles in and too the most unlikely of places.<br />This is a horror story that turns your stomach because it is a true horror story, of how a man and a woman could get away with cold blooded and totally calculated murder for years.<br />This book is not for the faint hearted or squeamish; it is brutal, and explicit in its search for truth and understanding.  It is well written, savagely analytical and totally mesmerising from beginning to end.  It is a book that I can recommend but only if you have the stomach to read it.	2004-06-05

Bang goes the Prime Directive but it is an emergency after all!<br />The humanoid looking inhabitants of Sardalia are only too eager to help Voyager and are very friendly, too friendly in fact and it soon becomes apparent that there is something going on that is being hidden from the crew.<br />It turns out that all the inhabitants on Sardalia have a genetic illness called the Gray Plague and the only medicine to keep the symptoms at bay is the blood of a giant sea creature called the Darra but there is a war going on between different factions who want to control this very precious commodity.<br />But the Darra are sentient beasts, and their distress becomes evident to Harry Kim when he and Tom Paris end up with Marima the daughter of the Sardarlian Leader in a rather sticky situation in the middle of a hostile ocean.<br />There are a couple of faux pas in the book, but not enough for it to make much difference to the plot and the over all exciting story.<br />Well worth a read despite what everyone else says!	2004-04-20

My mother once said to me when I was a young girl that in my life there will be ten books I love with a passion and ten books I hate with a passion<br />The Human Stain comes under the \\"ten books I hate with a passion\\" remit.<br />I really wanted to like this book, honest!  All I can say is that I am glad I only paid a $1.50 for it in a thrift shop and didn't go out of my way to order it new because I would have not only been disappointed but I would have been downright annoyed at myself for throwing away my very hard earned pennies!<br />The Human Stain is quite simply a very BIG HUMAN stain of jumbled words, unlikable characters (except for Faunia Farley) and a plot that is so flimsy and full of holes you want to scream out your frustration whilst jumping up and down on the book in a bid to beat the breath of life into it!  However there is only so much jumping up and down on a book you can do until you realise you are flogging a dead and buried horse.<br />So what do we have that makes this book extremely infuriating and teeth grindingly awful?  In a nutshell that answer is the anti-hero/protagonist Coleman Silk, a 71 year old recently dismissed for racism College Dean, living a lie for nearly half a century, fornicating quite happily with a 34 year emotionally crippled College Janitor and trying desperately to justify his wasted life (despite doing so many noble and good things in that aforesaid wasted life) before kicking away from this mortal coil.<br />What is so agonizing for me as a read is that this book could have been so much more than what it was, but what it ended up being was a pile of literary trash of little merit other than a wonderful concept that was totally ruined in the hands of the esteemed Mr Roth.<br />I have no problems with the use of profanity in books, its comes with living in an enlightened society but Mr Roth takes it to heights I didn't think was possible, I was almost impressed, almost but not quite...<br />Coleman Silk's sexual escapade with the brittle and emotionally broken Faunia is flung into your face at every available opportunity and you are left feeling somewhat queasy, (or more bluntly sick to your stomach) especially as you are aware that Faunia is so damaged by her own tragic history, molested as a little girl by her step-father, called a liar by her blinkered mother who refuses to believe she has married a pervert, physically and mentally abused by her ex-husband a emotionally, drug addicted and very unstable Vietnam vet and mother to two dead children, killed in a fire and blamed for their death by her ex.<br />And what is Coleman Silk doing to help Faunia?  He's merrily banging her bones and lamenting over his dismissal as Dean to Athena College, something he could have avoided if he had revealed his own racial heritage (he passed for white when he was actually Black) but pride wouldn't let him and he allows himself to be destroyed in much the same way a martyr to a supposedly just cause would.<br />This book got two stars only because of the creation of Faunia and the idea of a College Dean being fired because he was supposedly racist only for everyone to eventually find out that he was actually Black himself, I really liked that irony and thus I feel a generosity of spirit that perhaps I otherwise wouldn't have.<br />We only glimpse tiny fragments of Coleman's past life as a Black man and his reasons for leaving his racial heritage behind, it's like being given sips of delicious lemonade and then being told, \\"Sorry, there isn't any more, nor is there EVER going to be any more,\\" so hard luck and this is one of several reasons why I found this book so hard to digest and come to terms with.<br />Finally I can only hope and pray that the film with Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman is much better than the book, I don't think that can be too difficult because the book is so atrocious (with certain exceptions listed above!) I don't think the film can be much worse.pade with the brittle and emotionally broken Faunia is flung into your face at every available opportunity and you are left feeling somewhat queasy, (or more bluntly sick to your stomach) especially as you are aware that Faunia is so damaged by her own tragic history, molested as a little girl by her step-father, called a liar by her blinkered mother who refuses to believe she has married a pervert, physically and mentally abused by her ex-husband a emotionally, drug addicted and very unstable Vietnam vet and mother to two dead children, killed in a fire and blamed for their death by her ex.<br />And what is Coleman Silk doing to help Faunia?

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br /><br />Louis L'Amour has never been one of my favourite authors because most of his books are Westerns but \\"Last of the Breed\\" is an exception to my rule simply because it isn't a Western.  This is a brilliant novel that is both suspenseful and creative and it is a real shame that a sequel was never done.<br /><br />Set during the hostilities between the Soviet Union and the USA Joseph \\"Joe Mack\\" Makatozi is a man trapped in enemy territory.  He is a downed test Pilot who has been captured by the Russians and is seemingly at their mercy in the inhospitable landscape called Siberia; the only inhabited cold Hell in existence.<br /><br />However Joe Mack isn't your ordinary test pilot.  He is part Sioux and in his blood is the will to survive a savage land that was once home to his ancestors. He escapes his prison with the goal of crossing Siberia and making his way across the Bering Straits and into America, something that has not been done by modern man.<br /><br />Joe Mack finds himself slowly merging with the wilderness, forced to rely on his ancestral abilities to survive the killing cold and elude the constant danger of his determined Soviet pursuers, including a man who is to become his nemesis, a Siberian Native Yakut tracker called Alekhin who knows that in order to trap his quarry he must think and act like a Sioux.<br /><br />As we follow Joe Mack across the deadly landscape we become aware that he is changing, he is becoming what his ancestors once were thousands of years ago, trackers, hunters, killers, but ultimately survivors.<br /><br />It is a slow transformation, and along the way we watch him struggle to hold onto his humanity, finding love in the guise of a woman who helps him and a fragile but brief friendship with a crippled furrier but all the time he is in the cruel wilderness Joe Mack is changing into something that can never revert back to what it once was.<br /><br />He hungers for revenge against Alekhin and the jovial but brutal Soviet Commander who imprisoned him and the book ends on an eerie haunting note when the Soviet Commander receives the scalp of Alekhin and a gentle warning from the wilderness that he will be next...<br /><br />This is a truly magnificent book about a man's ability to transcend his environment and upbringing and descend into savagery in order to survive.<br /><br />Once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down, this is no run of the mill pot boiler about the noble savage.

Only three stars overall, were are the literary appreciators in this world, standing behind the door me thinks!<br />It was a great read from beginning to end, and it reminds me a lot of the Cadfael series of books in that it is set in the same time period but follows the fortunes of the young Hugh Corbaille (de Leon) and his search for his true identity and the murderer of his true Crusader father Roger de Leon.<br />We are treated to a mystery within a mystery, first there is the mystery of who Hugh actually is and then there is the mystery of who murdered his real father.<br />Hugh has been raised the as the adopted son of the Sheriff of Lincoln but his early childhood is shrouded in mystery.<br />The Sheriff took him in after finding him half dead one winter's night and quickly realised the boy was not a Saxon child as he spoke Norman French and for the next thirteen years Hugh lived a happy half life, unable or unwilling remember his past but with the death of his beloved Foster Father, he finds himself travelling down a path that could either free him from his unspoken nightmares or kill him as it had killed his real father so many years before...<br />Joan Wolf obviously did a lot of research before writing this book and I found it exciting and interesting, even enjoying the romance between Hugh and the 16 year old daughter of the Knight Nigel Haslin along with a cast of other savoury and unsavoury characters such as Hugh's Uncle, now the Earl of Wilshire, a title that in reality belongs to Hugh as his father' heir, and his troubled birth mother, the beautiful Isabel who has many secrets of her own she'd rather keep to herself.<br />All in all it was a very good book, enjoyable all the way through and well worth reading if you get the chance.	2004-04-11

Christopher is an intelligent, aloof and obsessive young man who you find yourself both liking and disliking in the same breath.  He is quite simply the oddest anti-hero in the history of literature.<br />When Christopher comes across the stabbed dead body of his neighbour's dog Wellington he is determined to find out who has committed such a hideous crime, especially as he counted Wellington as one of the few creatures on the planet earth that he actually liked and could relate too.<br />However Christopher is ill equipped to deal with the finer nuances of human nature, to him life is set out in a straight line and there are can be no deviations but by setting out on his \\"investigation\\" into Wellington's demise he finds himself digging up more than just the \\"murderer\\" of his neighbour's dog.<br />Christopher's father is adamant that his son will stop such \\"foolishness\\" as trying to be a Detective, and Wellington's owner is far from helpful, she has her own agenda as to why she does not want to know who killed her dog but Siobhan, a sympathetic Social Worker at Christopher's school encourages the youth to keep a book chronicling his discoveries and it is this systematic approach that leads Christopher to the heart-breaking truth about Wellington's death.<br />Family secrets are exposed and lies come bubbling to the surface, as a fragile deception finally comes full circle.<br />This is an amazing first novel, written totally from Christopher's point of view, we are a privy to world controlled by a boy who is determined to take charge of all aspects of his life.  Nothing can be random; nothing can be laid to chance.  He is obsessed with order and their end results no matter what the cost.  For example mathematics plays an important part in Christopher's life as does symbolism and logic and we are shown images and the mathematical equations that make Christopher's life tick.<br />Mark Haddon shows an acute understanding of the autistic mind in this compelling, some funny, often tragic but totally readable novel with a sting in its tale...(Pun intended here!)ck.<br />Mark Haddon shows an acute understanding of the autistic mind in this compelling, some funny, often tragic but totally readable novel with a sting in its tale...(Pun intended here!)	2004-01-29

Precious Ramotswe getting her first case and finding out that being a Private Detective is as much about common sense and good advice as it is about the investigation of a client's case.<br />The plot is neatly cut up into interlocking sections with Mma. Precious Ramotswe taking on her first case to prove if her client's father is actually HER client's father!  She gets the answer in a most ingenious way and this opens the door to more cases, including the disappearance of a young boy and a sinister mystery in the form of a small bag of human bones...<br />As you weave your way through the story you meet a selection of wonderful characters like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni the owner of Speedy Motors who is sweet on Precious, and Mma. Makutsi, the cleverest secretary in Botswana, she scored 97 percent on her secretarial exam and now works for Mma. Precious Ramotswe, serving bush tea, introducing clients and secretly pinning her hopes on becoming a trainee Private Detective!<br />This book is not what you call an exciting read but this does not stop it from being totally engrossing and enjoyable; in fact if you are looking for excitement it is best that you give this book a miss as you will be disappointed.  It is slow an interesting read, with plenty of description about Botswana life and her people, as well as the mystery element of a Private Detective novel.<br />Mma. Precious Ramotswe has been likened to an African Miss Marple, well I am inclined to disagree though I do think she is as clever as Miss Marple, she does not have Miss Marple's ruthless streak.  Rather she is compassionate and understanding about the frailties of human nature.<br />In the not so distant past she herself was a battered wife with a short lived marriage to a violent trumpet player who deserted her as well as having the joy of motherhood for a brief few days.  Because of this Precious has acquired an acute understanding of what it is to be flawed and full of human desires and like Miss Marple uses her experiences to understand the situations she is asked to investigate.  But as I said before the similarities between the two is like chalk and cheese.<br />Well worth the read, but remember don't expect fast cars, fast women and fast men.

He did what he thought was his duty as a human being and a pacifist.  In 1939 Nicholas Winton a Stockbroker from London set about trying to save the doomed children Jewish children of an about to be invaded Czechoslovakia.  His efforts saved 669 of them.<br />In 1939 there were some 15,000 Czech Jewish children in existence.  By the end of the war in 1945 only 100 or so of these children were left alive plus the 669 that Nicholas Winton had managed to save and get to the UK before the European borders closed down.<br />One of these children was Vera Gissing who co-wrote this book.  For a long time she wanted to know who had saved her and eventually she found out.  This book is her testament to one man's selfless spirit and his desire to do what he considered was right.<br />In theory Nicholas Winton could be considered a \\"righteous man\\" a gentile who helped the Jewish people in their time of need.  But Nicholas Winton himself was born Jewish though he did not practice his faith, and nor did his family so he could not be bestowed with this honour (for he was Jewish in the eyes of Jewish law) but he could be recognised and acknowledged by those that he helped save.<br />Vera Gissing has co-written a marvellously engrossing book about one man and his life and times, and it is only as you read each page do you understand what Nicholas Winton did to get those 669 children to safety.<br />This is not a sentimental story, but you should be prepared to invest in a BIG box of tissues, because this story will move you to tears.<br />A wonderful book which like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" and \\"The Colour of Justice,\\" should be on the shelf of every school in the land.	2004-01-27

This is a woman who for 20 years was degraded and sexually abused by the very person who by rights should have protected her from such horrors.  Her own father.<br /><br />I have read many books about abused children, but this book is the definitive of all those books, written by a survivor, it's never sentimental, it's often brutally honest to the point of it being horrific but most of all it packs an emotional punch that could polax Mike Tyson in one blow.<br /><br />I actually came across this book by accident.  Late one the evening I was watching a program on SKY and there was a documentary about Tanjas life.  I sat mesmerised through the whole program and when it was over I went onto the Internet to find out more about her.<br /><br />It was then I found out she had written a book about her life, \\"Flight of the Dancing Bird.\\"  Sadly it is not available in the UK and I ended up buying it second hand from the USA as it is out of print even here.<br /><br />This is a book that should NEVER be out of print.  It is a book that every High School Library should have on its shelves, it also is a book that every mental hospital in the world should make its Psychiatric staff read.<br /><br />It is a book about an ordinary girl who suffered the most appalling of abuse and had the courage to carry on living.  It is also a book about a survivor who fell in love with a good man and is now in a loving relationship.<br /><br />I read it the moment it arrived, from cover to cover and it was one of the most painful experiences in my life.  However I don't regret reading it for one minute because Tanjas Darke is a heroine to me.  Because of her I am now able to look in the mirror each day and not be ashamed of myself anymore.<br /><br />Thank you Tanjas, you've helped another bird to finally find her wings...	2004-01-16

After this war was over, people started to be &quot;reborn&quot; people througout the centuries who had died before their time, young children but not babies and infants and very few people over the age of 55, are appearing near or where they died many years ago.  They are nicknamed Retreads and depleted Societies have accepted them with open arms, teaching them to live in a world often very different from the one they left behind.<br />Of course it is not all Utopia, far from it, a fight for power ensued in the 1970s between the Fundamentalist Nationalists who want to put the reborn Duke of Monmouth on the throne and the Democratic Coalition of all Creeds led by a reborn Lawrence of Arabia.  The Democratic Coalition won, and the Duke of Monmouth was once again executed and for the last 30 or so years peace has reigned in Britain.<br />But a conspiracy is afoot, and the Fundamentalists are gathering momentum as they head toward a revolution in which Britain will be forced back into her Hard Core Protestant days, with anyone who is different suffering the fate of those that do not follow the \\"true way.\\"<br />But all is not lost, Inspector Africanus and his motley crew of Police officers, consisting of a retread Spitfire Pilot called Guy who has only recently resurrected back to life, a slightly jaded female WPC who is trying to figure out her place in the world, and a jolly Irish giant nicknamed Uncle Seamus who might not be all that he seems.<br />Add to this boiling pot some wonderful characters like Lickpenny Nan, the Rakish Earl of Rochester, a mysterious young man called Henry Seymour and the delightful Digby family, one of whom is Guy's ancestor, a retread like himself and you have a delicious sense of being in and out of various centuries as you rub shoulders with high brow Victorians, decadent Georgians, over sentimental Edwardians not to mention the darker side of the retread experience, those who were once criminals with violent and terrifying pasts.<br />|The main thrust of this book is about the plot to overthrow the Democracy and those now in power since the defining war of the 1970s but there is a surfeit of information about Retread life past and present and this interweaves itself in and out of this dark and often humorous SF thriller making it a compulsive read from beginning to end.<br />I might add that this would make an EXCELLENT film and I am surprised that it wasn't a Best Seller but each to their own I guess!<br />If you get a chance to read this book then do so, you won't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't!ntly resurrected back to life, a slightly jaded female WPC who is trying to figure out her place in the world, and a jolly Irish giant nicknamed Uncle Seamus who might not be all that he seems.<br />Add to this boiling pot some wonderful characters like Lickpenny Nan, the Rakish Earl of Rochester, a mysterious young man called Henry Seymour and the delightful Digby family, one of whom is Guy's ancestor, a retread like himself and you have a delicious sense of being in and out of various centuries as you rub shoulders with high brow Victorians, decadent Georgians, over sentimental Edwardians not to mention the darker side of the retread experience, those who were once criminals with violent and terrifying pasts.<br />|The main thrust of this book is about the plot to overthrow the Democracy and those now in power since the defining war of the 1970s but there is a surfeit of information about Retread life past and present and this interweaves itself in and out of this dark and often humorous SF thriller making it a compulsive read from beginning to end.<br />I might add that this would make an EXCELLENT film and I am surprised that it wasn't a Best Seller but each to their own I guess!<br />If you get a chance to read this book then do so, you won't be disappointed, I certainly wasn't!	2004-01-09

That of free Blacks owning slaves during the days of slavery.  When he dies, Henry Townsend owns over 30 slaves, he was a free man of colour who crossed a line that perhaps should never have been crossed, but it is from a White man that Henry has &quot;learnt&quot; the art of owning slaves.  Henry's former master William Robbins took great pride in teaching Henry everything there was to know about slavery, and in a strangely warped sort of way, he was a surrogate parent to Henry, but at the expense of Henry's real parents who had managed to buy their own freedom but not of their child.<br />This book is not an easy read, there are many characters, some more important than others, and there is an underlying current of lives both Black and White intertwining in the strangest of ways.<br />With Henry's death comes change, and through the eyes of Moses, one of Henry's slaves we taste life through a Black on Black experience.<br />The irony and the strangeness of this novel's storyline are totally self-evident. A man who has gained his freedom in turn enslaves others.  What are his reasons? What if anything is he trying to prove?  These are just a few of the questions you will be asking yourself as you make your way through this oddly compelling read.<br />You cannot help but feel a combination of compassion and contempt for Henry, and as the story winds to its oddly unfinished climax, you can't help wondering who owned who, and if the power that William Robbins thought he had over his protege was actually something quite reversed.<br />This is not a &quot;coffee table book&quot;; it is a book that is meant to be read.  Worth taking on holiday, but only if you are going somewhere where you can sit in the shade and take your time over each and every single page....	2004-01-09

There has never been a hero like Waldo and there probably will never be one again....<br />This book was published in 1973 and I read it in a paperback edition some ten years later.  It was a book that I was to read again and again until the paperback novel finally fell to pieces.<br />This is an unusual read, with an even more unusual storyline.  Its hero is a young boy called Waldo who is born with Down's syndrome or Mongolism as it was known then.  His parents, a white middle aged, middle class family guiltily consign him to n expensive \\"special\\" home in which he spends his first few years of life.  Accidentally given a continual overdose of highly potent vitamins, combined with his missing chromosome, Waldo emerges from his chrysalis as a genius but a secret genius who does not trust the world that has confined him to the Shady Glade Institute.<br />With the constant chatter of TV in the background, Waldo learns about the world through the highly politicised news of the day.  Waldo is a child growing up in the 1960s and is a living witness to a world filled with  violence, war and extreme change in which he is going to play a very BIG part.<br />Cunning, sly and incredibly intelligent, Waldo fools all the hospital staff and his family into thinking he is an above average Mongol but nothing too spectacular that will get him overly noticed.  Befriending a burnt out CIA agent who has been sent to Shady Glade to recuperate after a breakdown, Waldo eventually reveals himself to the man and acquires his first friend and convert to his cause.  His next friend however is not so well chosen, a young girl, who almost betrays his secret and only his sheer intelligence gets him through the tests and questions that follow and it is this experience that makes Waldo realise he has to leave Shady Glade or eventually he will expose. What better place to go than his guilt ridden parents house in the suburbs?<br />And so Waldo worms his way into their affection and finally their house.  And it is here he starts his empire building.  \\"Borrowing\\" some money from his parent's bank account he starts to make money on the stock market and eventually moves into politics helped by the now released and slightly less burnt out CIA agent who comes to revere the boy's brains and cunning and together they set out to change the very fabric of post Watergate politics.<br />Waldo's first ally in his bid for political domination is the family Black Maid who he pays to run errands from.  She is the first person to have a semblance of understanding about Waldo's abilities and grows to respect him though their friendship is based on his need and her greed.  When his parents finally find out about Waldo's corporations and his multi million dollars they are drawn into his finally tuned web, becoming his staunchest supporters.<br />The story climaxes with Waldo's mother's death and a promise he makes to her.  He will get America out of Vietnam and it is to this end that book makes its steady journey.<br />Never boring, often tongue in cheek but done so subtly you are barely aware of it, this is a wonderful book that punches you constantly in the chest with its dry wit, cutting dark humour and its portrayal of a USA in transition.house.

This book is a poignant trip into her parent's past as she struggles to come to terms with her own personal and still very present demons, inherited from her parent's war experience.<br /><br />Simply written and never sentimental, this is a book about how the past can affect the future and how the children of survivors in turn must become survivors.<br /><br />Jumping between her present and her parent's past, Anne gives us a vivid insight to two lives torn asunder by the brutality of war and their perpetual struggles to come to terms with the horrors they had both witnessed.  Without meaning to Anne's parents passed a legacy to their children, a legacy that would culminate in Anne striving to understand her place in the scheme of Jewish survival not only in a Holocaust context but a Jewish context too.<br /><br />With the birth of her daughters, Anne begins to understand her parents lives more and there is a wonderfully telling scene at the beginning of the book when Anne argues with her parents over the cold, her parents want her bundled up and kept warm, where as she sees her friends going about in thin coats and dresses.  She doesn't understand why they are so preoccupied with the cold but she gives into their demands and in doing so perpetuates their fears and carries them into the next generation.  Only when she begs her daughter at the end of the book to wrap up because it's \\"cold outside,\\" her daughter gently responds, \\"No mama, I'm not cold, you are\\" that she understands that she has to let go of some of her fears.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, well written book about Jewish lives in a non Jewish world.  Anne Karpf is never accusatory or angry with her words; rather she is analytical and systematic.  She writes about anti-Semitism with precise strokes, no one is blameless, both Jews and Gentiles come under her scrutiny and she puts every thing she writes in good historical context.  Her life in Oxford as a student is seen through both a modern young woman's living through the 1960s as well as a Jewish woman going through an identity crisis.<br /><br />I found this book an inspirational yet sombre read for a variety of reasons but the main reason was that it never tried to gloss over human fragility.  Britain's lack of support for Holocaust survivor' is blunt and to the point, even Israel does not escape unscathed, as Anne's point's out, it is only recently that people acknowledge the effect the Holocaust had on a variety of people, not just those who survived the horrors of the camps and most of this has come about because of films like \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Shoah.\\"<br /><br />A final description of this book would be \\"an intellectual roller coaster of a ride through one woman's family history.\\"  A book worth reading.n good historical context.

There have been many books written about Diana since her death, some more sensational than others.  This book will probably be the one that everyone remembers over all others because it has been written by someone who knew the Princess Royal intimately.  Her Butler Paul Burrell.<br /><br /> I do not for one minute say that this book should not have been written what I do say and believe is that it should have been written by someone else other than Paul Burrell.  He will never be able to be neutral about the woman he worked for and he has his own agenda, part being I suspect a vendetta against the Royal Family for not only letting Diana down when she needed them the most but for almost letting him go to jail for supposedly stealing belongings of his dead employer.<br /><br />Having had a preview of this book, in the Daily Mirror no less, I am somewhat sceptical about Burrell's motives for writing it.  He claims to be altruistic and wants the world to know the \\"true Diana\\" but what I have read so far is nothing more than sensationalism at its best, poetic licence in this case needs to be well and truly revoked and the reader aware that what they are reading is fiction rather than fact.<br /><br />This is a book that needs to be read with that proverbial bucket of salt, in fact don't use a bucket, invest in a very LARGE barrel, because though are probably a lot of truths Mr Burrell is stating, (he was her butler after all) there are also a lot inconsistencies in his prose and boy does this man know how ramble!  The last time I rambled on in such a verbose way I was able bodied and making my way up Snowdonia via a well trodden track!<br /><br />By all means read this book, but do not accept it as the gospel about Diana Princess of Wales, even her own family did not know her, and before anyone asks, no I am not a Royalist, in fact if anything I am an anti-Royalist but I am a human being, and Paul's book is a cruel way for two young boys to find out that their mother had feet of clay....<br /><br />My two star rating is based on what I have read so far, it could go up or down in the very near future, however I need to read the whole book and I will only do this when it becomes available in my local library.d feet of clay....<br /><br />My two star rating is based on what I have read so far, it could go up or down in the very near future, however I need to read the whole book and I will only do this when it becomes available in my local library.	2003-10-26

Especially books that deal with historical subjects that have had so much written about them you don't know which way to turn.  It has to be said that British-Romano History is one such subject that comes under this sometimes dubious honoor.<br /><br />Roman Brtain - A Very Short Introduction has four compact chapters covering the subjects like the beginnings of British history, the Roman Conquest of Britain, Britain under Roman rule and finally then end of Roman rule in Britain.  There is also a Chronology which takes you through from the beginning of Roman occupation up until its end in 409AD.<br /><br />I like this book as you can find which part of British-Roman history you want to delve into and go from there.  It even has a short section on the ill fated revolt of the Iceni Queen Boudicca, along with other important subjects such as the rise of Christianity and the building of Hadrian's Wall.<br /><br />There are several photos and illustrations plus some maps, one showing an overview of 2nd Century Roman Britain.<br /><br /> This a compact, easy to read book that will give you a taster of Romano-British History from beginning to end.  However if you want something more substantial then this book probably won't give you what you want.<br /><br />Quick reading at an affordable price.	2003-09-25

As a Brit I have to confess that I wasn't sure I was going to like this book because the title was enough to frighten me away!  I mean what do I know about American women?  However the blurb intrigued me and I do like books that are \\"different\\" and thought provoking so I took the metaphorical bull by the horns and settled down to read it, expecting to read it over a course of several days.  All I can say is, \\"What a gem of a book!\\" and please can Miss Choi write to my employers and explain to them why I was three hours late to work, it's her fault, I was so engrossed I lost track of time!<br />I won't lie to you and say that this is an easy book to read, it isn't but it is worth the effort and it is strangely gripping, and even frightening in parts. The protagonist (and heroine) Jenny is suposedly a radical living in a time of political, economical and social upheaval.  It is the 1970s and the world is no longer made up patriots and nationalists.  Students are demanding change, and European ideas and politics are invading the consciousness of an insulated nation.  Jenny herself is the daughter of a Japanese American man who suffered internment in the 1940s and though in the beginning she calls herself a radical, she has serious doubts about the things she has done in the past and what she is about to do.  Herself a fugitive from the law, (she helped in a bombing of some Draft Offices) she is called out of hiding to help three young radicals, one of them recently the kidnap victim of the other two.  It here we are introduced to Pauline, fragile, confused, and perhaps more dedicated to the cause than her once-upon-a-time captors who treat her with benign contempt mingled with reverence.<br />Often humourous, sometimes tragic, we are drawn into the shadowy world that Jenny and her friends inhabit.  Hiding out in a farmhouse with the three dysfunctional radicals, who sprout Marxism and put themselves through harsh physical training for the war that they are sure that they will have fight in when the time comes, Jenny finds herself questioning her own ideals, along with the lack of compromise on all sides, both within the establishment she despises and the young radicals themselves. Jenny even questions even the passion that drives her charges along with the right way forward in a world built on lies, hypocrisy, racism and social injustice.<br />As Jenny and Pauline forge a tentative friendship, perhaps built on their mutual similarities and differences, Jenny reminisces about her life, her love affairs and her bittersweet relationship with her proud but deeply cynical father.<br />Jenny is very much an anti-heroine, both loved and despised in the same breath but she instils sympathy from the reader, where as Pauline is more of a spoilt little rich girl trying to break free from the constraints of her upbringing with only a glimmer of sympathy from the reader because of her emotional fragility.<br />There are many other interesting characters in the book like Jenny's ex-lover/friend Frazer who brings her out of hiding in the first place, and the other two radicals (once Pauline's captors) who want to change the world in a day but mostly this book is about Jenny, and Pauline with everything else weaving its way around them to bring the story, plot and climax of the novel its final conclusion.<br />An intellectually stimulating, intriguing and compulsive read is my final word on this novel.  \\"American Women\\" can be read by readers of any nationality because all of us, young or old can remember a time when we thought the world we lived in could be changed beyond all recognition by the power of our voices, the passion  of our beliefs, and the rebellious acts of our bodies, only to shed bitter tears of maturity when we realised that the establishment we sought to defeat wasn't going to fall to its knees and change was a concept of the mind rather than a physical reality.hey will have fight in when the time comes, Jenny finds herself questioning her own ideals, along with the lack of compromise on all sides, both within the establishment she despises and the young radicals themselves.

They annoy me much in the same way that a veruca will annoy you.  However the case of &quot;Revenge of the Middle Aged Woman&quot; I will make an exception to my rule, well who said rules were made to be bent whenever is necessary!<br /><br />This is a deliciously entertaining book about Rose, her adulterous husband Nathan, the other woman, the diabolical Minty (a rather fragile she devil) and Rose's oddball grown up children Poppy and Sam.<br /><br />The plot centres around Nathan's affair with the brittle but beautiful Minty and the affect it has on Rose, his wife of many years.  When the affair finally becomes public Rose has lost not only her husband but her job too.  However Rose is more resilient than she thinks and bit by bit she finds herself shedding her previous life, and heading down a path she might have taken if she had not chosen to marry Nathan.<br /><br /> Add to this a cast of quirky characters like Rose's eccentric mother Ianthe, an ancient cat called Parsley, Richard, the man Poppy marries suddenly in Thailand, a suicidal ex-girlfriend of Sam's and Hal the man Rose might have taken up with if she hadn't chosen Nathan and you have a novel to make you laugh and cry in the same breath.<br /><br />Page by page we are treated to Rose's rebirth as a new woman, no longer in Nathan's shadow, no longer the wronged wife. With each trial and tribulation Rose rises to the fore and survives even the most bitter of blows.  Like when she is forced to sell the marital home she finds herself able to exhale and move on to the next task at hand.  And in the background Nathan is finding that life with the &quot;other&quot; woman isn't all it is cracked up to be and that Rose the wife that he had complained confined him, is now the one that is free.<br /><br /> Funny, heart rending and totally absorbing, &quot;Revenge of the Middle Aged Woman&quot; is a book for those people who can honestly go with the old Spanish proverb, &quot;Living well is the best revenge...&quot;l is the best revenge...&quot;	2003-09-07

I was once one of those students forced to read this book at school. I was dragged kicking and screaming to its pages and read it only because I did not want to flunk my English Literature class. I was riveted from the first page, right up to the last paragraph. It is quite simply Conrad's finest book, (yes, I read his other books after this one.)  However be aware, this is not everyone's cup of tea.  There will be some people who will read this book and think, \\"Oh God, you have to be kidding!\\"  However if you can get passed this mentality then you are in for a real literary treat.<br />The story is simple enough, a young Englishman; Marlow (this character appears in Conrad's story \\"Youth\\") goes out to Africa to seek his fortune. He is at first idealistic, and full of himself. However he quickly realises that Africa is full of petty bureaucrats who have no idea how to make use of this dark jewel they have acquired. Like Colonists before them, they proceed to ravage and plunder the land of its natural resources. Enter Kurtz, an Ivory Trader who has gone Native. He has become a Renegade, living with his Black mistress in the heart of Africa's interior; systematically turning his back on his supposed civilised self.<br />Marlow meets Kurtz after an eventful trip up the Congo and finds himself curiously attracted to this strange man who is [very ill], and obviously going insane. Kurtz in turn is an embarrassment to his employers who would rather see him dead than returned to \\"civilization.\\" Of course this is unspoken, and the hypocrisy of human natures sticks out like a sore thumb in this novel, especially as Kurtz is one of the best Ivory Traders on the Congo route.<br />Marlow struggles to understand Kurtz and what makes him tick, but he only touches the surface of a man who can live in neither the Black or White world comfortably. He has been [harmed] by both worlds and therefore he is cursed. Heart of Darkness has many facets; it is a story about Imperialism, racism, and the darkness of human nature. Conrad purposely leaves the ending open to interpretation. ...<br />This is a book that will make you think, make you want to it re-read again and again in case you have missed anything. There are also some genuinely funny moments in the book such as the Doctor who measures skulls for a hobby and the pompous Trading Post clerk who teaches his Black maid to starch his clothes. This edition, (Dover Thrift) is well worth getting as well, as it is [inexpensive] and cheerful and it definitely won't break the bank money wise.m, and the darkness of human nature.

It is also written in as none-biased a way as I have ever seen.  Eric Schlosser tries to be fair to both those who love fast food and those who don't.<br />Schlosser does paint some fairly graphic horror stories, about health and safety issues along with some stomach churning tales about people spitting into food before serving it, not washing their hands after going to the bathroom to name some of the many nasties he has come across during his research into this interesting subject.<br />This is a well-researched book, which for me gave an amazing insight not only into the Fast Food Industry but also into other subjects that was and still are linked to its phenomenal growth.  Some of the areas covered are the industry's dependence on a teenage work force, its impact on low income families and immigrants, how Fast Food is perceived all over the world, and health implications because of the high fat content in a lot of fast food.  Also covered is the power that the Fast Food Industry has, and how it has wielded this power for both good and bad.  Impressive is one word that springs to mind with regard to this book.<br />I especially liked Eric Schlosser's eye for detail in that it moved between the past and present as well as covering in great detail the Fast Food Industry's growth outside of the USA.  I found it fascinating, informative and most importantly very easy to read.  Well worth buying or borrowing this book from the library if you get the chance.	2002-12-02

I mean come on, we go on about the violence of rap and the Black American Culture but then someone produces the Dixie Chicks and \\"Goodbye Earl\\" and everyone thinks its funny!

Written partly as a dedication to the classic novel &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; this collection of easy to read shortlets (a great way to describe each piece)is wonderfully reminisent of an age long since past.  Occasionally sentimental but never syrupy, this little book is pleasure to read, and it will have you giggling and crying in the same breath.<br />Yellow Bricks and Ruby Slippers might not be the best seller of the century but it is a wonderful little page turner that allows you momentarily to be nostalgic and enter a timeless world full of Munchkins, witches, dogs and little girls whose friends are scarecrows, cowardly lions and tin men who want a heart...  If you are a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; fan this book will pique your funny bone and remind you that you too can click your heels and know that there is no place like home.	2002-03-14

When it was finally carbon dated and sadly proved to be a fake (or is it a fake, even now there are doubts?) I felt immense sadness even though I am not of the Christian faith.<br />In the early 1970s onwards Professor Grove set about with a group of fellow scientists, religious zealots, curious hangers-on and an assortment of faithful doubters to use this new technique in a scientific manner to prove the worth of carbon dating.  And what better than a piece of historical enigma to use this new discovery on other than the Turin Shroud?<br />This book follows Professor Grove through the many years of negotiation it took before the Vatican finally allowed the controversial experiment to go ahead.<br />In parts this book is highly technical but Professor Grove manages to make himself and the theory behind Carbon dating understood.  He is never sentimental but I picked up on a quiet unspoken faith he has in both the scientific and the religious and he comes across as man who somehow manages to balance these diametrically opposed modes of thought in a coherent and sensible way..<br />This is both a good read, surprisingly quite humorous in parts as well as being a technical masterpiece which anyone with a leaning toward academia will appreciate.  Worth getting out from your local library if the cost is too prohibitive.	2002-02-14

I haven't a romantic bone in my body (so I have been told) but I loved the front cover and despite my initial uncertainty I decided to borrow it off my friend and read it. It was quite simply a treat of a book that was so easy to get into that I read it all in one go.<br />The plot, based on fact by way, tells a bitter-sweet story of love and loss set against the backdrop of World War II. Julia Bradley is a young girl who marries a dashing young pilot not long after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The story follows her as she at first struggles with married life and motherhood. Written as both a narrative and in journal form, we are transported back in time to a young girl's initiation into womanhood during a time of global conflict. Still a child when she marries (she still sees older people as grownups for a while) Julia eventually overcomes most obstacles to forge a strong and loving relationship with her husband Matt. However tragedy is looming on the horizon and Julia will soon need all the strength she can muster for those dark days ahead.<br />I had to invest in a box of Kleenex by the end of the book, but every snort and tear was worth it...hmmmm perhaps I do have at least one romantic bone in my body!	2001-11-29

I agree with one reviewer that some of the characters could do with having their mouths washed out with soap (and I am no prude) but other than that it was pretty good.  The characters (thought overtly vulgar when there was no need to be) were well portrayed, and the plot interesting enough to keep you turning the pages.  The book leads you into an integrated modern society where human and elves live side-side though not always in harmony.  Enter Rosie Lavine, a jaded PI who is hired by a Rock Group's official groupie, Candy Cayne (no joke here folks) to find out who might be trying to kill the lead singer of a Elf Rock Group called Cold Iron.  At first Rosie thinks it is all a piece of Rosie's drug induced imagination but when she is warned off by a group of professional thugs she changes her mind and immerses herself into the bizarre world of sex, drugs and Elf Hard Rock Music.  Attracted to Jorandel, the sexy but degenerated lead singer, Rosie is on a roller coaster ride of a lifetime and it's not a pleasant experience.  Haunted by her own demons, mainly from her childhood, Rosie lurches from clue to clue in a desperate bid to find out who wants the charismatic Jorandel dead.  There are an assortment of other characters that thread in and out of the story as it wound its way to its climax, but it was Rosie and Candy who kept me turning the pages, as well the destructive relationship taking place between Rosie and Jorandel, played out in the sordid world of Elf Hard Rock music.  I did enjoy the book but I feel it could have been so much more.  All the same for a first attempt into fantasy Ms Michaels didn't do too bad a job really.	2001-11-24

Jenna and Jeremy's father Eric has just killed their mother Rachel and they are left with to pick up the pieces of his heinous crime.  Narrated alternately from both Jenna and Jeremy's point of view, the story follows the two children as they struggle to come to terms with the heart-breaking legacy their father has left behind.  Not the closest of siblings, with Jenna having been a Daddy's girl, and Jeremy getting on better with their mother, the two siblings are forced to reconcile their differences in order to survive the future.  Not easy when you both have the weight of the world on your young shoulders.  There is their father's trial to deal with, a traumatic experience for both youngsters, plus secrets that need to be told as well as old family conflicts that have to be dealt with.  This is a sharply written book with good dialogue, some of it very grown-up in places.  Jenna is a precocious 8th grader, whilst Jeremy is almost bird-like, fluttering uncertainly at first as he tries to sort out in his head what made his father kill his mother.  Both children bounce off the adult characters, such as Karen their father's first wife, their grandparents and an assortment of friends and curious hangers-on.  A thought provoking book that reminds me of Judy's Blume's &quot;Tiger Eyes&quot;, dealing with the concept of violent death in sensitive and none-condescending manner.	2001-11-22

After the death of her grandmother whom she has lived with for several years she goes to live with her divorced mother and this is when her problems really start.  Digging into the past Katie finds out that she isn't the only child who is, well a bit strange.

As Katie tries to find her fellow &quot;silver eyes&quot; she is watched from afar by a man who could be a friend or a foe.

I have always had a passion for the Gita, more commonly known as the Song of God, with the deity Krishna telling his friend Arjuna why he should go into battle against people who were once his friends, as well as his family. It is a poem of devotion and love but it is a complex poem that touches philosophy, and it's not your run of the mill philosophy either.  The Gita is not the easiest book in the world to understand, especially when translated from Sanskrit into English, it seems to loose something and up until now I have not been able to put my finger on what that &quot;loss&quot; was. Reading Jack Hawley's translation I can now see where other translators have gone wrong (for me personally). They have been quite LITERAL in their translation of the Gita and in being so literal have lost the passion that is the telling of the Gita. Jack has managed to put that passion into his translation and I cannot thank him enough. He has switched a light on inside my head and now I don't have to phone my father every five minutes shouting &quot;Baba, what does this part of the Gita mean????&quot; Not only that but this version of the Gita is so easy to read, with a good bibliography and index at the back for reference, plus some interesting musings from the author in the introduction and afterword. It is also a fairly compact book, which makes it easy to carry around, a bonus in my opinion, especially as most Gita's I have come across are bulky and very heavy. We could do with this translation being available in the United Kingdom; it would make life for the younger Hindus like myself so much easier.	2001-11-13

Le Guin creates a world where technology is the all seeing, all doing God of the people.  A world where the old ways are condemned and literature and art are &quot;corpse rotten&quot; and have to be destroyed. There are no books to read and no history to remember.  Only a consumer-producer society is acceptable, and anyone who deviates from this path is condemned, punished and forcibly re-educated.  Enter Sutty Dass a young girl of East Indian descent who is desperate to hold onto the past whilst living in the future.  On the plant Aka as an official observer she gets the chance to see the past as it used to be, in fragments so tantalizingly small you can only get a taste of what used to be.  But Sutty is an intelligent young woman and she realizes very quickly that the old ways are not as dead as the technology-controlled government would like to believe and an underground system of &quot;telling&quot; the past has sprung up in order for people to remember what once was.  What starts as a job of work for Sutty, becomes a spiritual quest for redemption in the guise of story telling and mystical encounters.  Sutty herself is being reborn from the flames of the past, as her name implies, as Suttee means death by fire for widows and Sutty is a widow of sorts.  We find ourselves gently drawn into this illicit world of Guru's, mystics and ancient wise ones, whilst looking over our shoulders for the ever-present danger of Government Monitors whose task it is stamp on everything to do with the past.  We are eventually led to a hidden library high in the Aka mountains and it is here that Sutty learns the true meaning of the past and how she as an outsider can help redress the balance for those who hanker for the old days, and those who fear the loss of technology.  A vibrant book, filled with laughter and tears, and a host of characters who are larger than life and totally memorable.  This is a novel for those readers who like a book to get their teeth into, a novel, which makes them think and wonder, and then think so more.  An excellent and understated read that deserves six stars out of five in my opinion.h into, a novel, which makes them think and wonder, and then think so more.

I absolutely loved it from beginning to end.  This is a time-travel story with a bit of a twist.<br /><br />Charlotte Makepeace is a new girl at an old boarding school.  On her first night she goes to sleep in her bed and in the morning she wakes up as Clare Moby, a schoolgirl from over forty years ago.  Of course Charlotte is confused, even more so when people don't realise that she is not Clare, not even Clare's younger sister Emily.<br /><br />Somehow she struggles through her first day as Clare but to add to her confusion she finds herself back in her own time the following day and no one has missed her!  Charlotte soon realises that Clare is taking her place in her time and she is taking Clare's.  The two girls muddle through by communicating through Clare's diary, leaving each other notes and messages in order for them to survive in their swap-over worlds.<br /><br />However it's not long before Clare's younger sister Emily realises that something is wrong and Charlotte is forced to tell her the truth.  With Emily as an ally, Charlotte's time in the past is a little easier but there is a dark cloud on the horizon.  Clare and Emily are going into lodgings outside the school and the children have worked out that the time travelling that they are experiencing has something to do with the bed they sleep in and the tree outside the window which exists only in Clare's time.<br /><br />This is an exciting story that moves at a fair pace, even more so when Charlotte is trapped in the past, forced to become a day pupil and temporarily forfeit her real life in the future.<br /><br />Charlotte's identity is soon in question even to herself.  Is she Charlotte or is she in fact Clare?  Only Emily constant nagging about trying to get the real Clare back keeps the young girl aware of whom she really is.<br /><br />Charlotte experiences life in England during the First World War.  What once was history for her becomes the present, and she suffers with her new friends, as they loose loved ones to foreign battlefields, and face the terror of air raids in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Charlotte's eventual permanent return to the future is not without its own problems but luckily Clare had her own ally in the form of Elizabeth, a dorm mate who like Emily realised that Clare was not Charlotte and helped her as best she could.<br /><br />Charlotte's return to the future is not with out a tragic price.

A little girl Marianne is confined to bed after a serious illness and to wile away time she takes to drawing with a pencil she finds in what used to be her Great-Grandmother's workbasket.  To her surprise she dreams about her drawings and they come to life in an extra-ordinary way that she struggles to understand.  Jumping between the real world and that of her dreams Marianne slowly becomes conscious that world she is creating is making itself felt in the waking world and affecting not only herself but another sick child called Mark who she has never met but who is fast becoming an important part of her life.  This is a surprisingly suspenseful book, with Marianne a tender ten-year-old acquiring almost survivalist skills in a bid to avoid the terrible stones she drew in fit of pique when angry with Mark.  Realizing that Mark is in danger she sets out to save him, and aided only by trusty pencil and sketchpad, she ventures forth with Mark from the confines of the magically drawn house to a tower and finally to the safety of the sea.  Adults and older children alike will enjoy this book, which puts modern children's classics to shame.	2001-05-07

This is a great read that is both atmospheric and suspenseful as it moves between the 19th and 20th century, telling the story of Dana, the time-traveler and Alice, a 19th century slave.  These two women are inextricably bound together by time, blood and history. However, only Dana has a real understanding as to why she is going back and forth in time and part of it is has to do with saving the life of a white boy called Rufus, who eventually, becomes Rufus the slave-owner, and the father of Alice's two children. Dana is a reluctant witness in history, forced to push Alice towards a destiny that is both cruel and savage, making Dana realize that however hard her life as a Black women in the 20th century is, Alice's life is by far, far worse. Quite simply an amazing book that should surely be made into a film one day.	2001-03-10

This book is so delicious I just want to eat it!  &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; might be in many people's eyes a story about morality but to me, it's a story about children and their love of all things sweet, sticky and delicious.  Charlie Bucket is the delightful boy (who is so poor all he gets to eat is cabbage soup) who finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar he buys with money he finds in the street.  This ticket entitles him and a companion to enter the wonderful world of Mr. Willy Wonka, the most famous and mysterious chocolate maker that the universe has ever known.  Other competition winners include such heinous but wonderfully over the top characters like Augustus Gloop, the greediest boy in the world, and Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat whose father buys 10,000 chocolate bars so she can win a golden ticket.  These greedy children and their frightful companions get their come-uppance in various hilarious ways that will have you spluttering with laughter with every page that you turn.  Dahl's most famous creation in this book though are the Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people that Mr. Wonka has saved from extinction in the days when he traveled the world.  This is a glorious, glorious book, filled with amazing characters, incredible sweets such as the everlasting gobstopper for the child with limited pocket money, and the chewing gum that that is a whole three course meal in itself.  Your mouth will be watering throughout the story, and the river of chocolate will make you drool a waterfall.  A scrumptious book for everyone no matter what their age.	2001-03-07

Also published under the title &quot;Tales from the House Behind,&quot; this is a collection of juvenile/young adult stories that Anne Frank worked on during her years in hiding in the annex with her family and fellow fugitives.  It proves that this young girl had an incredible gift for writing, and that had she lived she probably would have been received the Noble Prize for Literature.  Her stories were often candid indictments of her own family life, such as Kitty, which tells the story of a young girl who day-dreams and a mother who wants her child to listen and obey rather than dream.  Anne's essays show an in-depth understanding of human nature, surprising for one so young.  This is a poignant book filled with fables, short stories, essays and even part of an unfinished novel.  It's worth reading after you have read &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; simply because the diary will give you more insight to this amazing girl's life.  However &quot;Tales from the Secret Annex&quot; stands on its own too, and like the diary should be on every school child's list of books to read.	2001-03-06

It is however not for the faint-hearted as it covers a multitude of horrors such as rape, mutilation, and murder.  Phoolan Devi's story is not an uncommon one in India, but her reaction to her treatment by society and its Caste System is more extreme than most. She takes up arms, and becomes a bandit, representing her sex in a way never before acknowledged in India.  This book does not try to justify what Phoolan Devi did during her time as an outlaw, rather it tells the story of young girl wronged.  From a tender age this young girl and her family were abused, not only because of her Caste but also because of her sex.  That a woman would dare to fight back was unthinkable to many people but Phoolan Devi was a woman with nothing to loose and everything to gain.  This book chronicles her life and times, never sentimental, sometimes vicious, but always inspiring, this book is a testament to the human spirit and all that it can endure for the sake of justice and truth.  Phoolan Devi did things she shouldn't have, but in a world where livestock is often valued over human life, she had no choice.  This is an amazing book, well worth reading, and certainly well worth reprinting.	2000-09-23

The world that we know is gone and the status quo has changed.  White people no longer exist and dark skin is valued over light skin.  The book follows Amhara, the darkest child in her family as she learns about the world outside her tribe, and comes to understand the prejudices and fears of her people who condemn anyone born with a light skin to death or lowly servitude.  It is only when she falls in love with a white Drone, found on her travels with a group of disparate people that she begins to realise that her people must learn tolerance or forever live in the shadow of a history they have always despised; a history of white supremacy and disregard for humanity because of the colour of someone's skin. Day of the Drones is surprisingly well written with believable characters and an interesting story line.  If you can get hold of a copy, do so; it will be a welcome change from modern Science Fiction.	2000-09-23

Everyone likes Miss Butterpat but everyone, from her grandmother to her pupils think she is as ordinary as they come and no one thinks she will do anything exciting during the summer holidays.  How wrong they are!  Miss Butterpat with her newly knitted blue jumper dresses up as a sailor and sails away to South America, she dances in the local carnival and then goes off to explore the jungle.  She's almost squashed by a boa constrictor, has to sleep in a tent, and even ends up using her jumper to help her fly across a river.  All in all Miss Butterpat has a wonderful time, spending time with local Indians and becoming an adept drum player, to playing poker where she wins a bag of gold which she uses to pay for a luxury cruise back home.  However upon her return to school and her pupils, Miss Butterpat is unable to convince anyone what she has done so she pretends all she did for the holiday was stay with her grandmother, and help look after her garden.  This is lovely book with colorful pictures, and just enough text for a new reader who wants something fun and different, which this book certainly is!  Miss Butterpat is a wonderful creation, especially at the end of the book when she decides to knit a jumper that she will use when she eventually climbs Mount Everest.	2000-09-23

Considering that this subject has been &quot;done to death&quot; (forgive the dreadful pun), Wambach does an excellent job in presenting facts, figures, and case studies in this intriguing book that tries to separate the wheat from the chaff.  The book is interesting enough for the layperson to enjoy, but technical enough for the more enlightened to have on their shelves.  Wambach obviously believes in reincarnation but she is skeptical enough not to take it on face value.  Rather she presents her audience with various case studies that she has undertaken over several years, and the outcome of the consequent follow up research to see if the past lives can be proven in any way.  It is a fascinating book that I read from cover to cover.  Wambach is not trying to convert the reader, rather she is presenting her case, and in the end it is up to us to believe in reincarnation or not.  A good read for anyone who likes to explore the unknown.	2000-09-23

The subject of Vampires is one such bandwagon but Marjorie  Blackman has managed to avoid these pitfalls and produce a great book that  both teen and young adult will enjoy.  Also as an added bonus, the heroine  Heather is a young Black girl, which as an ethnic minority myself I felt I  could relate to, especially when dealing with the issues of racism which  Blackman bought in and dealt with considerable ease.  The storyline follows  Heather and her (white) boyfriend Andrew backpacking across Europe and how  Andrew is turned into a Vampire by a seductive young man with a deadly  secret.  For the moment Heather is spared from this ordeal but Andrew  persuades her that the only way they can be together is if she lets him  turn her into a Vampire.  Being a Vampire turns out not to be all that  Andrew promises, especially when she has to kill her neighbour's son pet  rabbit to quench her thirst for blood.  Also Andrew has changed, he is no  longer the boy that Heather loved and would have died for.  Being a Vampire  has corrupted him, not only that his racist family are accusing Heather of  causing all his problems and it's not long before everything gets out of  hand and Heather has to stand up to Andrew in a battle in which only one of  them will survive.  This is a surprisingly good read and is well written  with convincing dialogue and believable characters.  Andrew's mother is a  grotesque parody of a parent, and his brother Morgan is a vicious spoilt  young man who both hates and fears Heather.  The book starts off slow and  then gathers momentum until you are practically eating every page.  If you  are looking for a happy ending then this book is not for you, however there  is the consolation that Blackman might write a sequal which would I wish  she had already done, because I think Heather has great potential as a  serial character, even more-so than Buffy the Vampire Slayer!ich would I wish  she had already done, because I think Heather has great potential as a  serial character, even more-so than Buffy the Vampire Slayer!	2000-09-08

It is a lovely story for younger children about a Scottie dog and his relationship  with a cat who he at first hates but eventually learns to appreciate as  time goes on.  The book is filled with both colour and black and white  drawings, the artwork is great, and the storyline easy and fun to follow.  Both children and adults will enjoy this little book, I know I did when I  was a child!	2000-09-08

The author Cowie swiftly takes the reader  through the life and times of this famous British Mariner who lived and  died during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.  Accompanied by many black and  white photos, the book is a simple but effective introduction to just one  part of British History.  Each page is filled with a plethora of  information that younger children will find easy to understand and even  enjoy.  This is a good solid book that sadly is no longer in print but if  you can get a copy of it second hand, then do so; it makes a welcome  addition to any child's library.	2000-09-08

Filled with gorgeous pictures and minimal  text, the story follows a small dog called Paddy during his day off from  working with the lovely acrobat Trilby O'Farrell.  On this day he always  takes his pay in a little purse and goes to town to spend it.  We follow  him from the shops, to the barber, to his little adventure when two naughty  boys try to steal his money, and we even accompany him to his visit to the  cinema to see Lassie in action.  This is a wonderful book for younger  children as the pages are stuffed full of colorful detail that bring Paddy  to life, in fact the text is incidental as it is easy enough to follow the  story without any words.  Once again it is a shame that this book is out of  print but if you can get hold of a copy I am sure that both you and your  children will really appreciate this funny, and delightful little story.	2000-09-08

The book itself is colorful, and combines both 3D  imagery with good quality ordinary artwork.  My seven-year-old nephew (at  the time) loved it, and was more interested in the dinosaurs, (3D and  drawn) than the text itself but with my help we tallied up the dinosaurs to  the writing, and had great fun in doing so.  A nice, fun read that kids of  all ages will enjoy.  Shame it's still not in print.	2000-09-08

I found this wonderful book in a thrift shop, as I wanted my 6-year-old nephew to understand that the world is made up many different people but I didn't want to confuse him too much. This book is great and its fun to read as well. It tells the story of a little girl called Jenny and her two fathers. They live in Denmark, have regular contact with Jenny's mother who helps Jenny and her father Martin prepare a surprise birthday party for Eric. The story follows Jenny's life with her two fathers, and how various family disputes are sorted out such as Jenny not wanting to go to the launderette and a quarrel between her two fathers. It also gently points out that not all people are accepted in society but does it in such a way that children will not be upset. The book is filled with lovely black and white photos, and nice sized print that makes it easy for children to read or for an adult to read to younger children. It is a great book and it is a shame it is out of print. Well worth getting as it stands on its own as nice children's book that is both enjoyable and fun.	2000-09-06

Learning the alphabet needs to be fun, and this book is fun.  Looking at various creatures that have become  extinct over the years, it takes the child (and even adults) through the  alphabet in a delightfully colorful way.  The pictures are bright and well  drawn, the text quirky and humorous but always informative and it is a  sure-fire way for the older child to remember the alphabet whilst at the  same time learning about creatures that no longer roam this planet. A fun  and educational book in one, what more more can you ask for?	2000-09-06

This is a great book with colorful pictures and an amusing storyline.  Martha is a dog and one day she eats a  bowl of alphabet soup and suddenly finds she can talk.  At first her owners  are delighted but the novelty soon wears off when Martha talks none-stop,  creating many funny situations that leave you giggling as you turn each  page.  Martha is truthful, never lying, thus causing embarrassment for her  owner when she tells someone that her owner said the fruitcake she had made  was not fit for a dog, but she (Martha) had enjoyed it.  Eventually the  family tell Martha to SHUT-UP and she is crushed and after that refuses to  talk anymore.  This is resolved however when Martha saves the day when the  family home is burgled. This book will have you crying with laugher as this  little pooch and her family worm their way into your heart.  Having read  this book to my six-year-old nephew I feel that the reading age for this  book should be six to eight as it is filled with conversation that might be  too hard for a very young reader.  All the same it is a great book for an  adult to read to a child, and the colorful pictures are well drawn and  pleasing to the eye.  A very nice book, that most young children (and  adults) will love and want to read again and again.	2000-09-06

My Place is all about identity and what racism and prejudice can do to a people.  The white  settlers who colonized Australia have systematically tried to bury the  Aboriginal people and their way of life but somehow against all odds they  have survived, and people like Sally Morgan are standing up to be counted  as the descendants lost tribes of mixed race people who were never given a  chance to choose who they wanted to live with.  Sally Morgan writes with  startling clarity as she describes her childhood with her half Aboriginal  Grandmother who would never admit to being native, and often told her  Grandchildren to lay claim to an Indian heritage rather than admit the  truth.  Sally's Grandmother's fears lay deep within her own childhood when  she was taken away from her mother, and it was this fear she passed onto  Sally's mother who was three quarter's white.  Both women were terrified of  white authority and the power it had to tear families apart.  My Place is a  haunting, true story of one woman's search for her roots in a country that  saw Aboriginal blood as a taint rather than a celebration.  We need more  books like this on our bookshelves, and even more people to read them...	2000-07-04

This is a wonderful book written by the renowned naturalist R.D.Lawrence that aims to introduce school children to the world of the wolf.  Lawrence is one of the foremost experts on wildlife, and has written many books for  adults, but this book is aimed at a much younger audience.  Children from  nine years and onwards will thoroughly enjoy this colorful book that is  filled with amazing photos and an interesting narrative that takes the  young reader deep into the lair of the wolf.  Lawrence presents his  experience of wolves in the wild as well as other interesting facts such as  the historical distribution of the wolves over the centuries and how wolves  differ from other canine species.  This is a well written book that will  draw the child into the strange and wonderful world of the wolf.  However  this book is more suitable for the older reader; younger readers would  probably enjoy looking at the many photos and drawings but the narrative is  aimed at a child with better than average reading skills.  Several younger  children that I know of who have been introduced to this book as a learning  aid were keener on the colorful drawings/sketches than the photos (though  they did like them) and they wanted a more interactive book.  They  especially liked it when Lawrence \\"asked\\" them questions such as \\"Is it a  wolf or coyote?\\" and then described the difference briefly whilst showing a  sketch of a wolf and a coyote.  It would be great if another book about  wolves could be published to meet the needs of younger readers (age group 4  to 8 years) because there obviously is a niche that could be filled.  All  the same this is an excellent learning aid for the older child, as well as  being a beautiful book that charts the rise, fall and rise again of the  supposed big \\"bad\\" wolf.	2000-06-27

It was a great help though I will admit that it has been written for the intellectual reader who already knows a fair amount about  Ruebens, his life and work.  Svetlana Alpers presents the reader with  various paintings and sketches and discusses them in detail throughout the  book.  This is not an easy book to read but if you are patient and are  willing to read it in several sittings then you will definitely benefit  from it.  A good solid read for anyone wanting to research Rubens on a more  scholarly level.	2000-06-09

It's a great read for the person who just wants to sit down and enjoy a sparkling love story with a bit of a  difference.  The plot follows Ivy a young American bookstore owner who is  transported through time when she reads from a book of spells a sweet  little old lady sells to her one day.  Ivy finds herself in 17th century  England where she catches the attention of Julian Ramsden, a young man  struggling to survive with his family under the puritanical rule of Oliver  Cromwell and his Roundheads.  Of course Ivy and Julian fall in love but not  before all sorts of strange and wonderful things happen to them both.  Without giving too much of the story away, 'Enchanted Time' is a fun book,  with some genuinely witty moments, a lot of delicious love scenes between  Ivy and Julian and a delightful plot that includes a time-hopping Granny, a  mute child, and a very nasty Witch Hunter General who goes by the name of  Josiah Feake.  This is a great book to take on holiday as it doesn't tax  your brain cells and has the added bonus of being fun to read as well.	2000-06-09

Okay, so the age of the Vikings wasn't really funny, but Terry Deary has a great way of making the reader chuckle despite themselves.  History can be horrible but it also can be VERY funny.  How can you not laugh when the first words you see are &quot;the Vikings lived in Scandinavia - that's the posh word for Sweden, Denmark and Norway.&quot; Also there are many cartoons to make history come alive in a way that children can relate too.  The Horrible Histories series is wonderfully funny whilst at the same time being a great learning aid for children of all ages.	2000-06-09

The idea of a ship controlled by a human brain is so 21st century I was amazed that Anne McCraffey had come up with the idea so early  on in the 20th century! The story centers around Helva, born with terrible  physical defects, her brain is transplanted into a metal shell until she is  old enough to be put inside a Space Craft where she will merge with the  technology and become part of the ship.  Her relationship with her pilots  and passengers is poignantly portrayed, whilst her ability to sing is  nurtured by those she comes to love and trust.  Helva is not just a  dispossessed brain implanted into a space ship, she is totally human, she  loves, she grieves, she gets angry.  She is all woman but she is also part  of a machine that has work to do among the many planets littered across the  universe.  Helva becomes aware that machines with brains also can go rouge,  as humans do, but even though she looses a pilot she loves, she remains  true to her designation and learns to adapt to every situation thrust upon  her by the humans she works with and for.  The title refers to Helva's  ability to sing, something she does out of love for her first pilot, and it  is her singing that teaches her more about her human/machine soul, than  anything she has learnt through study or experience. This is a quirky,  curious novel about a human/ship hybrid, and is well worth reading, just  for the wonderful ideas it comes up with. For example Helva is paid a  salary to maintain herself, as well as being allowed to choose her  companions (pilots.  The plot itself is fragmented in that it is not  continuous, rather many little stories are being told as Helva takes on  various missions and meets an assortment of people both good and bad.  An  interesting idea that works and reads well.  Well worth buying.	2000-06-08

The plot seems simple enough, Britain is on the verge ecological disaster, a Fascist government is in power, and to make  things worse a group of children are getting together, children born with a  strange power that enables them to manipulate adults to do what they want.  The children are led by David who has worked out that the same unknown man  has fathered them, and it is to him they owe their unusual gift. Enter a  curious reporter called Peter and a sociologist Claudia whose investigation  leads them to some astounding theories about genetics and the children's  heritage.  Put this all together and you should have an exciting  science-fiction thriller that keeps you constantly on your toes.  Sadly  this book does not do that.  The plot which is sound in itself becomes  nothing more than a spring-board for the various sexual adventures of the  gifted youngsters, who turn out to be promiscuous as well as talented.  The  adult characters aren't much better, and it is almost impossible to  visualize the main protagonists because they are so one-dimensional.  I was  sorely disappointed with this book, especially as it promised so much from  the synopsis.  Reading it was like reading a manuscript written in treacle,  it was messy and sticky, and I felt quite sick after I'd finished it!  It  gets two stars instead of one simply because the cover and the synopsis  were eye catching, but other than that the book is a real dud.  Sad but  true.	2000-06-03

A friend lent me a copy of &quot;Wild Seed&quot; and I was riveted from page one and could not put it down.  Octavia Butler is one of the best  science-fiction writers to come out of the 20th century.  Her pages are  filled with characters that are believable even though she often puts them  in `out-of-this-world situations.'  In \\"Parable of Sower\\" she introduces  the reader to Lauren, a young girl with the unenviable ability to feel the  pain of others.  A \\"talent\\" her father has taught her to hide from others  outside her family.  The world Lauren is living in is slowly descending  into anarchy and Lauren, is living with her family in a small enclave,  protected by her Minister father, who thinks one day everything will go  back to normal.  Lauren however knows that the walls that protect them will  not stand forever, and she prepares to leave before it is too late but it  is already too late and her family and friends are raped, murdered and  mutilated by a vicious gang of drug-addicts.  With two fellow survivors  Lauren sets off on a quest that will lead them halfway across America,  gathering others along the way, such as two young prostitutes on the run  from their pimp father, a middle aged Academic, an orphaned child but to  name a few.  A tentative alliance is forged, one that will enable them all  to live through the dreadful times ahead.  Lauren carries with her a  strange new belief, that of Earthseed, a creed that will one-day lead to  the stars and a life beyond a corrupted earth.  As she and her slowly  growing band of followers' search for sanctuary she preaches Earthseed to  them, and soon begins to recruit coverts among her fellow travellers.  \\"Parable of the Sower,\\" is a haunting novel of a world in transition, where  only the strong, the cruel and the vicious survive.  The weak and the sick  are either killed for enslaved.  As Lauren and her followers' head for a  farm where they hope to find a home, the young girl is witness to history  repeating itself.  Slavery is making a come back and people like herself  who can feel the pain of others are being sought by unscrupulous men and  women who have seen the benefit of such having workers that are in tune  with the agonies of others.  This is a dark novel of how easy it is for  humanity to be bought to its knees, but it also a novel about dreams,  desire, and the need for a new future.  Earthseed might just be the answer  to a dying planet's needs and Lauren could be the Prophet who makes it  happen.  Octavia Butler's writing is atmospheric, exciting, romantic and  there is never a dull moment from the time you turn the first page.  A  marvellous book and I highly recommend it for first time science-fiction  readers, as it is easy to get in to and understand.e they hope to find a home, the young girl is witness to history  repeating itself.

In \\"Esther\\" she takes the biblical story of the young Jewess who saved her people from annihilation and turns it into a love story.  The King of Persia is looking for a new  wife and he sets about doing it in a very unusual way.  Esther is one of  many  girls who are chosen to go to the King's palace and await an  audience.  The audience will take place every evening, giving each girl a  chance to impress the King with her beauty and talents.  The King will  decide there and then if the girl is to be the next Queen of Persia.  Esther eventually wins the heart and mind of the King, and thus becomes his  Queen.  The King is unaware of her Jewish heritage, as is his favourite  Hamen whose secretly plots their demise by manipulating the King into sign  their death warrant.  It is up to Esther to save her people, and this she  does, with wit, charm, wisdom, and a healthy dose of female cunning.  \\"Esther\\" is an enjoyable read that tells a biblical story from a fictional  point of view.

It is however not for the faint-hearted as it covers a multitude of horrors such as rape, mutilation, and murder.  Phoolan Devi's story is not an uncommon one in India, but her  reaction to her treatment by society and its Caste System is more extreme  than most. She takes up arms, and becomes a bandit, representing her sex in  a way never before acknowledged in India.  This book does not try to  justify what Phoolan Devi did during her time as an outlaw, rather it tells  the story of young girl wronged.  From a tender age this young girl and her  family were abused, not only because of her Caste but also because of her  sex.  That a woman would dare to fight back was unthinkable to many people  but Phoolan Devi was a woman with nothing to loose and everything to gain.   This book chronicles her life and times, never sentimental, sometimes  vicious, but always inspiring, this book is a testament to the human spirit  and all that it can endure for the sake of justice and truth.  Phoolan Devi  did things she shouldn't have, but in a world where livestock is often  valued over human life, she had no choice.  This is an amazing book, well  worth reading, and certainly well worth reprinting.	2000-05-31

The editor has picked out a selection of interviews and testimonies that make up this horrifying but riveting read about the senseless murder of the Black British teenager Stephen Lawrence. Chronicalling the inept mismanagement of the murder enquiry from the word go by the British Police, the anguish of Stephen's parents, and the uniting of Jews, Asian and Blacks in their bid to get to the truth, this book strives to give an overall view of a case that shocked a nation. Stephen Lawrence died because he was Black. He was murdered in the most cruel and callous way possible by a group of young men who to this day have not been bought to trial. This book sets out to show the world \\"the colour of British justice,\\" and how it does not necessarily always apply to ethnic minorities. The book is not a condemnation of all things \\"White\\", it shows compassion too in the form of the man who stayed with Stephen and whispered in his ear as he lay dying, \\"you are loved, remember you are loved\\" and the rose tree he planted in his garden, nourished by the blood he washed off his hands after the incident. \\"The Colour of Justice\\" is so very shocking because it is true and it is for this very reason that this book should be in every school library in the country, not to condemn but to teach the next generation that \\"the colour of justice,\\" should be the colour of equality.<br />24th July 2002<br />Two of the suspects involved in the Stephen Lawrence's murder have just been found guilty of a racially motivated attack on a Black off duty Metropolitan Police Officer.

I do not deny that he is a brilliant writer and he has obviously researched this book quite extensively but he has made a mistake that many historians make, he shows only half the picture, and in doing so gives a very one sided account of the Second World War. His overtly sympathetic portrayal of &quot;Hitler's War&quot; is a convincing manuscript.  Irving genuinely believes Hitler was a puppet who did not know what was going on around him. May be he didn't know everything his Generals and advisors knew but Hitler certainly knew about the final solution despite what Irving says. If you do read this book, then try and read one in tandem with it that criticizes Irving's work so that you have a balanced understanding of Hitler and the Second World War, then make your decisions as to what you believe and what you don't.<br />I must add that I found this book very hard to stomach, mainly because it was so obviously biased in one direction. Perhaps if Irving himself had been a victim of the Holocaust that he so vehmently denies took place, or if his beloved daughter Jessica had been thrown into the gas chambers in Treblinka then perhaps he would look at history differently and write his books accordingly.	2000-05-30

It tells the true story of one man's friendship with a savage dog/wolf hybrid that sees man as his natural enemy, especially as he has  been ill-treated since puppyhood.<br />When Lawrence takes the Hybrid into his  home he finds that he has true savage on his hands, and that it will take  all his skills as a naturalist to tame an animal that was more wolf than it  was dog.  This is not a sentimental book though Lawrence and the hybrid he  names Yukon do become friends, rather it is a story about two creatures  getting to know one another, in an unforgiving world.<br />Yukon is testament  to man's inability to understand the mind and soul of a wolf.  Lawrence  eventually realizes that Yukon will never be a \\"people\\" dog and  that the remainder of his life must be spent in the wild with wolves.  And  so Lawrence makes the ultimate sacrifice, he lets Yukon go, giving him the  freedom that should have been his from birth.<br />This a poignant, funny,  humorous and often sad book about a man and a hybrid and how they learnt to  respect and love one another, yet never loose sight of which side of the  fence that each belonged.  For all nature lovers, especially those with a  passion for dogs, wolves and hybrids.<br />Since I wrote this review in 2002, this book is now back in print which I am really pleased about.<br />I am also sad to say that R.D.

Based in Shrewsbury, this intelligent, shrewd and often resourceful monk sets about solving murders in 13th century England.  &quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot; follows the murder of a nun, the seeming  guilt of a lovesick young monk, and the arrival of a strange young man  seeking out two fugitive children.  Add to this a band of outlaws, a  nobleman with a horrific secret, and you have the trappings for another  good Brother Cadfael mystery that keeps you guessing until the last page.  There is also a subplot that reveals a surprising secret about Brother  Cadfael's Crusade past.  If you want a series of books that are easy and  enjoyable to read, then you can't go far wrong with Brother Cadfael.	2000-05-29

His book &quot;THE AGE OF KALI&quot; is a collection of essays written during his many travels over the years through India.  Don't be deceived by the title,  although Dalrymple talks about the ancient Goddess Kali, this book is not  about her; it is in fact about the transition that India is going through,  &quot;the age of Kali&quot; a time when change takes place, often not for  the best. In this book he shows a side of India that perhaps many would  like to avoid discussing.  He talks about India's dark side, the violence,  religious intolerance, the abject poverty of many people, a stronger than  ever caste system along with the pain of a country struggling to find its  feet in the 20th century.  This is not a depressing book, far from it,  Dalrymple shows the reader, that despite all the problems India has to  contend with, she is a country of great beauty, great compassion and many  wonders, admid all the tragedy, corruption, and heartbreak.  This is not a  book for the squeamish and if you want a read that romanticizes India, then  this isn't for you.  However, if you are looking for a book that you won't  be able to put down, then this is certainly something you will want to read  again and again.	2000-05-29

Tim Cahill's travel writing is punchy, funny and downright irreverent in places.  It is also poignant, and darkly humorous,  a travel book with a difference. Peru, Africa, Austrailia and even America  are discussed from his unique point of view.  An especially good chapter is  &quot;Life and Love in Gorilla Country&quot; a journey through Rwanda and  the secret world of the Gorilla.  It is not a sentimental chapter, it is  brutal, sometimes funny but more often that not eye opening.  He talks  about how Gorillas have died at the hands of poachers and mentions the work  of the Naturalist Dian Fossey.  This travel book is not for the squeamish  or faint-hearted.  Also it meanders a lot, jumping from place to place,  subject to subject.  You have to prepared to read it as a series of essays,  travel logs articles that Cahill has written over the years and then put  together to make up this book.  However in this case it works and it is  excellent from page one onwards.  If you want a read with a sting in its  tail, then this is definitely the book for you.	2000-05-25
US	51914753	R167L2BFIEP3ZI	0748662030	625078965	Three Go Back	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Surprisingly Intelligent Book	Considering the rubbish that was being churned out novel wise in the 1930's, I was surprised at the quality of the writing, especially as it was dealing with science fiction.  The story line follows a time travel theme  in which three survivors from an airship disaster find themselves trapped  in a world some 25,000 years in the past.  But this is no ordinary  time-travel novel, because the travellers in question are in fact living a  kind of racial memory in which they are players rather than participants.  The writing is rich in description, and you can almost feel the heat from  the many volcanoes that litter a changing land.  The book can be hard  going, Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the author has written a complex story around  what could be a pulp fiction story-line and has managed to give it  considerable literary merit.  His three travellers are surprisingly  believable, and totally in tune with their own time, and its many  &quot;civilised&quot; intrigues.  Their descent into the past shows them  that little has changed in 25,000 years, only the technology has got  better, but the mind is still untamed. If this young writer had lived past  his 35th birthday he might well have given H.G.Wells a run for his money.  This book is worth reading simply because it is very hard to find an  intelligent 1930s science fiction that reads like literature.	2000-05-16

This is also a  fun book just to browse through to see what is &quot;in&quot; and what is  &quot;not in&quot; in the heady world of antiques-to-be and antiques that  are already established.

This is good &quot;pot boiler&quot; that is thoroughly enjoyable from page one onwards.  There are several story lines to follow, mainly centring around the reading of the wealthy  Troy Phelan's will.  His greedy ex-wives and sycophantic children think  they will be the beneficiaries to his multi-billion dollar fortune.  However the old man has no intention of letting them inherit and he leaves  the bulk of his fortune to an illegitimate daughter whom just happens to be  a missionary in Brazil's Amazon forest.  Enter the enraged family's  lawyers, all scrabbling for a piece of the action, and you have once again  a fine John Grisham book that is as suspenseful as it is well written.  The  characters are larger than life, some grotesque, some sympathetic but all  wanting something from the dead man's will.  Even the hero Nate, a burnt  out litigator is looking for something, but unlike Troy Phelen's family he  at least has some redeeming qualities. This is more of an adventure story  than a thriller, but it has great Court Room scenes and a pretty good plot  too.  Well worth buying if you want a quality read with lots of court  action, and dialogue that goes at a cracking pace. A big thumbs up for this  novel.	2000-05-04

I was dragged kicking and screaming to its pages and read it only because I did not want to flunk my class.  I was riveted from the first page, right up to the last paragraph.  It is quite simply Conrad's finest book, (yes, I  read his other books after this one.)  The story is simple enough, a young  Englishman, Marlow goes out to Africa to seek his fortune.  He is at first  idealistic, and full of himself.  However he quickly realises that Africa  is full of petty bureaucrats who have no idea how to make use of this dark  jewel they have acquired.  Like Colonists before them, they proceed to  ravage and plunder the land of its natural resources.  Enter Kurtz, an  Ivory Trader who has gone Native.  He has become a Renegade, living with  his Black mistress in the heart of Africa's interior; systematically  turning his back on his supposed civilised self. Marlow meets him after an  eventful trip up the Congo and finds himself curiously attracted to this  strange man who is dying, and obviously going insane.  Kurtz in turn is an  embarrassment to his employers who would rather see him dead than returned  to &quot;civilization.&quot;  Of course this is unspoken, and the hypocrisy  of human natures sticks out like a sore thumb in this novel, especially as  Kurtz is one of the best Ivory Traders on the Congo route.  Marlow  struggles to understand Kurtz and what makes him tick, but he only touches  the surface of a man who can live in neither the Black or White world  comfortably.  He has been corrupted by both worlds and therefore he is  cursed.  Heart of Darkness has many facets; it is a story about  Imperialism, racism, and the darkness of human nature.  Conrad purposely  leaves the ending open to interpretation. What is the &quot;horror&quot;  that Kurtz whispers with his dying breath, is it Africa herself with the  depths that have yet to be uncovered, or is it the human psyche with all  its viciousness as it greedily crushes a land and people into submission?  This is a book that will make you think, make you want to it re-read again  and again in case you have missed anything.  There are also some genuinely  funny moments in the book such as the Doctor who measures skulls for a  hobby and the pompous Trading Post clerk who teaches his Black maid to  starch his clothes.  This edition, (Dover Thrift) is well worth getting as  well, as it is cheap and cheerful and it definitely won't break the bank  money wise.usness as it greedily crushes a land and people into submission?

It is not a history per se of Malcolm X, nor is it a biography, rather it is a collection of ideas within ideas about Malcolm  X and what made him tick.  I must warn you though it is not as easy book to  read, but it rates five stars in my opinion because it attempts to be  analytical and non-judgemental about the man and his times.  Not an easy  task when you are writing about someone as famous as Malcolm X.  This is a  good book to supplement Alex Haley's book on Malcolm X as it looks deeper  into the man and what he stood for.  Well worth reading if you have the  time and patience.	2000-05-01

It is also one of the most exciting stories that will ever grip teenager and adult alike.  Who needs Harry Potter and friends when we have Frodo Baggins and the fellowship of the ring?  The storyline is simple enough.  Frodo and his cousins, plus the dim but loveable Sam Gamgee leave the safety of shire to head for adventures and lands unknown.  Lead by the mysterious wizard Gandalf, their first task is to find out the origins of the &quot;one ring&quot;, a ring with a history as bloody and magnificent as Middle Earth itself.  Frodo Baggins is an unlikely hero in every sense of the word, just as his Uncle Bilbo was in the prequel to Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit where the &quot;one ring&quot; makes it first appearance. It is on Frodo's small shoulders that the fate of Middle Earth rests, and when Gandalf is lost along the way, all seems doomed.<br />I won't say anything more about the plot less I give too much away and annoy potential readers to this wonderful epic of magic, war, music and tragedy.<br />On a more practical level I just love this chunky one book edition but I will warn you it is VERY heavy to hold so it might be worth investing in the individual books of the triology for ease of read.  Let's put it this way I have biceps on my wrists from holding this book up in bed so choose your Lord of the Rings books with care is all I can say!	2000-04-29

This book is testament to a child's spirit and humanity as she hides in  ever deteriorating circumstances with her family in an attic over an office  in Amsterdam.  We are witnesses to her first kiss with Peter a boy also in  hiding, and her stormy relationship with her mother which she tries to  resolve often unsuccessfully.  We see flares of brilliance as she tries to  understand human nature as well as the innocence of youth when she says,  &quot;basically I believe most people are good.&quot;  The Diary of Anne  Frank would probably be just an ordinary young girl's memoirs if the  Holocaust had not happened.  However the Holocaust did happen and Anne  Frank's diary stands for all the young girls whose lives were ended before  they had a chance to blossom.  If any book was to be made compulsory  reading in schools then this book should be it.  Through Anne Frank we will  never forget her humanity or for that matter our own.	2000-04-29
US	51914753	RTJPP6GJBURRP	0883630915	341297098	Law: The Art of Justice	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An unusual book	Law and Justice.  Two words that are not necessarily synonymous with each other.  In this book, the author, Morris Cohen shows the reader how law and justice has been depicted through art over the years.  From Egyptian times  through to the Civil Rights era in the United States, Cohen strives to give  us a physical image of law, justice and people.  He does a pretty good job  of it too; the pictures are well chosen, with artists such as William  Hogarth and the French caricaturist Honore Daumier gracing the pages of  this chunky but elegant book.  One of my favourite paintings is by the  African American artist Hale Woodruff who painted a scene from the trial of  the fifty four enslaved Africans who mutinied and killed the crew on the  Spanish schooner Amistad in 1839.  The pictures are also accompanied by  excellent text about the artist and the law that these images have invoked.  Not all the artists are painting the law within their own time scale.  Hale  Woodruff is one such example, he was born and died in the 20th century. If  you are interested in art, and law seen in a different context then this  book is worth trying to find.  It is a real shame that it is out of print  at this moment (April 2000) in time.	2000-04-29

Max and Helen are survivors of the Holocaust who are separated during the war and both end up in Concentration Camps.  Max believes Helen to be dead but many years later finds out that she is  still alive and goes looking for her.  What starts off as a journey into  both their pasts becomes a struggle for them to forget what the war and the  atrocities committed have done to them both as individuals; especially as  Helen's son is also the son of her Nazi rapist, something that Max finds  hard to accept.  This is poignant love story with a bitter-sweet twist, and  you are left wondering if Max and Helen will ever get back together?  The  ending is left open, and this to me is the saddest ending of all.  Simon  Wiesenthal proves himself to be a damn good writer of fiction as well as  fact about the Holocaust and its tragic consequences.	2000-04-29

Okay so it not as historically accurate as it should be, but come on folks, think of all those films that have been made recently like UB571, The Patriot and the new film about Colditz that has yet to be released? I mean talk about mythology in tehcnicolour!  This book is a bit like those films, we know it is all made up, but what the heck?  In the end what we are talking about is a very simple children's book that has a nice set of illustrations and a poetical text. This book is colorful, pleasantly written, and fairly well presented.  Should you want something that is considered historically accurate then read the book &quot;Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, a book I might add that is not for the faint hearted but does give a true if brutal portrayal of life for Native American and their European subjugators.<br />However for a less realistic and more innocent read then this book with its beautiful artwork is a good quality buy. Just look at it as a fairy tale, because that is all it is.	2000-04-24

In 1941 a German soldier Willy Georg went into the Warsaw Ghetto and took some pictures.  Without meaning to he documented for history what life was like for the Jews in the Polish Ghetto before it was raised to the ground by the  Nazis and most of its occupants massacred.  Willy Georg is not a hero, he  did nothing to help the people of the Ghetto, all he did was prove that  they had existed at all.  This book is tragic as it is magnificent.  The  accompanying text is concise and well written, showing the reader along  with the photos how people lived and died in Warsaw during the early 1940s.  This book should be on every library shelf and every school from Junior to  High should have access to it.  Sometimes pictures can speak louder than  words and in this case it is more than true.	2000-04-24

This is a knuckle bitingly good book and I spent the whole of an evening  reading it from cover to cover.  Andy McNab is as good a writer of fiction  as he is of fact.  I liked his hero because it showed the man to be human  and not just a killing machine as SAS soldiers are often portrayed in many  novels.  I hope that McNab thinks of writing a sequel to REMOTE CONTROL as  Nick Stone and Kelly make quite a formidable team.  A big thumbs up for  this cracker of a first novel.	2000-02-03

This is a romantic story about a lonely housewife and the  photographer she meets whilst her husband and family are at a fair.  It is  a gentle book that doesn't offend (unless adultery offends you, then you  will be offended!)and yes it is wordy and yes it can be a bit sugary, but  it doesn't have your archetypal happy ending either so this makes up for  that shortfall.  In its own quiet way it is quite a believable book, so  read it and enjoy.  I did.	2000-01-31

I also loved the fact it included a CD with  lots of classical music, something to listen to when reading.  Also the  colour photos were a nice touch too, and gave a stronger sense of what was  happening throughout the novel. Laura Esquivel has written another of my  favourite books, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; and she has not let  me down with &quot;The Law of Love.&quot;  This book is enjoyable simply  because it is a fantasy.

Written in the 1970s it follows the childhood of Michael Humfrey, the son of a plantation manager on the Island of Grenada in the 1930/40's.  This is not a book glorifying Colonialism, rather it is the memoirs of a childhood in a slowly  changing world.  It is beautifully written with lovely illustrations that  give a sense of what it was like to be a privileged child growing up in the  Caribbean.  This book might not be politically correct reading material,  but it is about a side of life that until twenty or thirty years ago still  existed.  It is worth reading simply because it is history.	2000-01-26

Smilla's Sense of Snow is complex, hard hitting and totally addictive, I couldn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover.  Peter Hoeg creates a truly believable  character in Smilla Jaspersen who sets out to prove that the supposed  accidental death of a little boy was in fact murder.  The book goes at a  cracking pace, jumping back and forth between the past and present, (hence  the complexity of the book), until finally all questions are answered and  Smilla's sense of snow is vindicated.  The film is excellent too; it  follows the book pretty well, with one or two deviations, which isn't bad,  considering that Hollywood has yet to make a film that follows a book to  the letter!  Read this book and enjoy it, it's worth the time and effort.	2000-01-25

Mr. Rogers writes about a taboo subject, the mixing of races, or as part of his title states &quot;Research into the  Negro Ancestry in the White Race.&quot;  It is a fascinating book if  somewhat stodgy and a bit pompous in places.  Considering that it was  written at a time when mixing white with black was illegal in many American  States Mr. Rogers does a fairly good job of informing the reader of how the  white-person should not be so complacent about his or her supposedly pure  racial heritage.  Mr. Rogers argues eloquently that race should not be an  issue, and that it is humanity that counts not the colour of a person's  skin.  This is a good book if you want to read various anecdotes about  racial mixing throughout the world both ancient and modern (modern being  the 1950s when this book was published) and I would recommend it as a good  but somewhat dated book on racial issues in the world.	2000-01-23

A white boy who was found out he was really Black.  This book is about &quot;passing&quot; and the legacy it leaves behind. Williams does not ask  for the reader to pity his heritage, rather he seeks to make people  understand why his father decided to cross the colour line and become a  white-man. This is a well-written and thought provoking book that I would  recommend to anyone from the age of 13 and up.	2000-01-22

Considering that this book was penned more than thirty years ago it has aged well. It is superbly written with beautiful photos, many of them taken by the author herself. With her small daughter in tow Elisabeth Eliot kept her faith in an ecologically hostile environment, living with people whose language she barely spoke, and whose way of life was as violent as it was beautiful. I was amazed at how Elisabeth's small daughter Valerie adapted to life in the Amazon Jungle, so much in fact that she preferred the local cuisine to her mother's cooking; she also grasped the complicated language of the Indians far quicker than her mother, and in all probability could have been absorbed into the tribe if her mother had not been there. The Savage My Kinsman is not a condescending book about the conversation of Savages to Christianity. It deals with the subject of God with simplistic honesty; this is a book about a woman, her faith and her desire to continue her dead husband's missionary work. I liked the book very much, and I am glad that even after thirty years it is still in print. If you want a plain read with no frills or flowers, just beautiful photos and straight-forward narrative, then this is the book is worth buying.	2000-01-22

The author, Joseph Joffo is never nostalgic about the ordeal he and his brother went through  in their bid to escape the Death Camps of Nazi Germany. He writes from the  heart but he writes with purpose.  His story is a warning to future  generations never to take their lives for granted.  A Bag of Marbles is a  fantastic book that should be on the shelves of every school in the world,  just to remind future generations that life is not always a bed of roses...	2000-01-22

I can't wait to give it to him so we can sit together to giggle over the bits of hair, fluff and bee's spit that supposed fill the book.  The heroine, Mona is a Vampire and this is her dairy.  It follows a simple story-line, Vampire likes boy, boy likes Vampire, sticky sweet human girl gets in way, sticky sweet human girl ends up getting sick so Vampire wins boy in the end.  This is accompanied by lots of thinks to read, touch, take out, and fiddle with, as well as a code to decipher and a pair of really COOL glasses to put on so as to see the secret bits in the diary.  All I can say, is buy it, sit down and have a bloody good laugh.	1998-07-27

It was money well spent and I am gong to buy Jim Dodge's other books when I get the chance.<br /><br />Dodge's  story about Fup, his friends Grandpa Jake and Tiny bought tears of sorrow and laughter to my eyes.<br /> Even Lockjaw the rampaging homicidal  boar made me chuckle.  It is an easy read I would recommend it most heartedly, especially if you're someone who likes to read when they are eating.  Just be careful, you might choke on some of the funnier moments, but its worth every cough and splutter.	1998-04-25

As for the book...all I can say &quot;Isn't it a downright shame that a tree had to suffer such a fate as being made into a book about the Spice Girls ?&quot;<br />If the quality of this book and its colorfully boring contents were put on a scale of hot to cold, all I can say is, hell would freeze over and Lucifer would skate home from work.<br /> This book is for the diehard fans of the Spice Girls, anyone else should keep well clear of it, it's a  real STINKER !	1998-04-10

If there was a Kingdom of BLAHDOM, Ginger Spice would undoubtably be the Queen and this book proves that without a doubt.  I have seen so much Spice Girls merchandise on the shelves I am think I am having an allergic reaction to the group.  This is one of the worst bits of Spice junk on the market.  If you have to have a book about Ginger then go buy an official version, or at least one that has better photos, better narrative, better everything basically. My God-daughter who is a fan of the Spice Girls was so disappointed with this book I had to go change it for something else from the Spice Collection, much against my better judgement, I didn't want to buy it in the first place! Buy this at your peril, you'd be better flushing your money down the toilet, you'd get better value for it.	1998-04-10

I read this book from cover to cover and then I read it again.<br />The author writes matter of factly about the history of her family whose color line spans black, white and in between.  It is a book you shed no tears over even though you feel grief for a family parted by racial intolerence; rather you feel elated that the story is being told at all because such a history was often a hidden history.<br />Thumbs up to  Shirlee Taylor Haizlip, she has written a real eye opener, especially with reference to the first US President George Washington.  His uncle fathered a son by a slave woman who in turn became the founder of Shirlee Taylor Haizlip's maternal family.  History is every colour under the sun, even the history of presidents.	1998-04-10

Normally I don't like books about people who invade other people's lives and cultures and proceed to preach christianity to them.  However when I read this book I found myself sympathising with the dying priest and admiring his relationship with the Alaskan Indians.<br /><br />I was surprised at how easily Margaret Craven made it all so believeable.  Kingcome became real and the slowly disintegrating tribe of the  Kwakiutl Indians touched my heart as I thought of the many indiginous tribes of people all over the world forced to integrate in a world that is not their own.<br /><br />Margaret Craven showed how humanity's progress and ignorance can be the footsteps of doom to others.  Even the \\"Christian\\" theme did not offend, in fact it softened my usually hard heart toward people who interfere in others lives.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book and it is one I will always treasure.<br /><br />I might also point out that the video with Tom Courtney playing the part of the doomed Priest is not that bad either, though like most films it does not alway follow the plot of the book but then you can't have everything in life, can you?	1998-04-10

From the first page until the last YOU want to know what happens to Musa the sadistic trader who wants to capitalise on miracles, his abused and repressed wife, the woman he rapes, and the other characters that drift in and out of the pages.<br /><br />The character of Jesus is wholly human and his temptations are not so much from the devil than the people around him. However, Jim Crace still manages to keep a mythical sense of Jesus and the task ahead of him, his curing of the dying Musa and the granting of Marta (the woman Musa rapes) her chance to have a child shows that miracles can come in many forms. The most grotesque (but by the far most fascinating character) is Musa. He is obese, obscene and brutal but it is through him (as much as Jesus) that the story threads its magical web.<br /><br />His cruelty to his pregnant wife Miri is only seconded by his cruelty to the other pilgrims who surround him. He is the ultimate salesman in the desert, demanding attention from those around him like a spoilt child, selling his wares and even the only source of water as if he were God himself.<br /><br />The only reason this book gets four starts out of five is that I think it should have been longer. I would have liked to have known more about the pilgrims return to their homes and families, especially Marta and Miri who flee together from Musa. They may not be sisters in flesh but they are sisters in spirit because of their suffering at the hands of a man whose only kindness to them is the children they carry in their bellies.<br /><br />Quarantine is an excellent read for those people who like a book with an attitude and never a boring page to turn. Most of all it is filled with characters who come to life with each passing page. Now that is what I call a good read.	1998-04-09
