The Tom of Finland Company's second collection of BD SM drawings and paintings by artist Etienne (aka Stephen). Is there a CM reader who doesn't know of Etienne (flourished 60s/80s, died 1991)? Etienne has long been one of my favorite BD SM artists and this collection does not disappoint. Several of the drawings are new to me, and it is good to meet these. The book covers a wide span of the artist's career, from the early comic strip \\"Patrol Car No. 682\\" to the later famous series illustrating six words: \\"Shoe\\" is perhaps my favorite of the six with the private licking the sole of his sergeant's shoe which is dangling from the head of the sergeant's erect dick, though \\"Rope\\" and \\"Piss\\" (not to be confused with the even hotter but very different \\"Pisser\\") are not far behind. There is much here to appeal to CM's readers: DS, SM, bondage, ff, military, prison. If you do not know Etienne's work, you should, and this is a good intro. Etienne's fans will not need me to tell them: get this. Hot!	2002-11-28

A magnificent collection of black & white art photographs from the creative lens of one of Italy's leading photographers. Geri Pozzar maintains that the reason he concentrates so much of his photographic energy into the male figure is that he simply loves men. This is reflected in his work which he aims at fellow gay men who have a predilection for body sculpture. The core of the collection is based on beautifully mature muscle males in various important poses. All the models are well-established friends of the photographer. The flavor is communicative, confident and cool. As an artist Geri Pozzar offers us new iconic images to ponder including his more specifically erotic studies. Here and there amongst this stirring vision of the masculine male Mr Pozzar ambushes us with his fine almost feminine studies of svelte youth.	2002-11-28

Friends & Lovers is Roffman's 8th photo book and at 176 pages is the largest book ever published by Bruno Gmnder.<BR>With his signature photo-narrative style, Roffman documents the real-life relationships of 7 attractive young men in the transition between the innocence of youth and a more worldly perspective of adulthood.<BR>The book chronicles Roffman's own journey as much as it chronicles that of the 7 young men. The journey began for Roffman in 1999 with a chance encounter between himself and a young man named Jeremy. The encounter began a sequence of introductions as each model brought a new member to the group. Inspired by the strong bonds and passionate relationships within the group, Roffman photographed these young men over a three-year period, culminating in the book.<BR>Friends and Lovers goes far beyond Romanesque posed images of muscled men and instead creates a world of real characters not afraid to expose their true relationships or give us insights into their most intimate moments. Commenting on the book, noted photographer Tom Bianchi has stated, \\"Older gay men might wish that they had this kind of erotic and playful start on their romantic life journeys. Roffman's book celebrates the fact that this kind of youth . . . is real for those who choose it now. He captures many elegant tender moments that suggest that this is always how we should have been.\\"	2002-10-08

It is perhaps even more  remarkable that Tom of Finland was not a traditional fine artist  his work  was most commonly regarded as gay pornography, and rightly so. Yet it is  art that not only had a tremendous impact upon the emerging gay culture  worldwide but whose erotic and emotional power remains unabated to this  day. For millions of fans throughout the world, as well as those unfamiliar  with Tom of Finlands art, this book brings uncommon insight into a  decidedly uncommon body of work.&quot; - text excerpt from Stonewall Inn	2000-07-22

Such was the question faced by Tom Clifden, a clever street hustler who found himself sexually glued to Hank Carter, a struggling would-be actor in New York  City. Their physical and sexual appetites for each other knew no  boundaries. Night after night they revelled in passionate and uninhibited  sexual episodes.  But the question comes up much later. Tom is 53-years-old  and (without Hank) has used his good looks and street smarts to good  advantage. He owns a string of bars across the country and is comfortably  settled in Key West. His quietude ends abruptly when a letter arrives from  Eunice, a woman who 25 years earlier was Hank's first love - and the woman  whom Hank had abandoned for Tom's unbelievable sexual powers and pleasures.  This is the story of two handsome young men who try to build a relationship  during the sexually explosive and carefree years of the late 60s. The tale  of their love unfolds, revealing the challenges of the ever-growing  temptations of Infidelity.&quot; - abstract from Intermale	2000-07-15

In stories that pushed back the boundaries and introduced talented new writers, these collections have  transformed gay literature into something at once poignant and provocative,  unique and universal. Now Men on Men 2000 ushers in the new century with  twenty original tales that shimmer with all the emotion, humor, pathos, and  drama of life. In &quot;A Venice Story&quot; Edmund White explores the  ever-narrowing gulf between desire and death, while Jim Grimsley's  &quot;Boulevard&quot; views desire through the perspective of pornography  and tabloid news. &quot;Ciccone Youths 1990&quot; finds Bruce Morrow's  lonely, ailing African-American protagonist entering a rollicking fantasy  world populated by four drag queens and their ultimate heroine, Madonna.  There are also stories by newcomers like David Tuller, whose  &quot;Sperm-and-Egg Tango&quot; puts the friendship of a gay man and a  lesbian to the test when they consider the possibility of parenthood.  Patrick Ryan's &quot;Second Island&quot; chronicles an American traveler's  obsession with a beautiful French hustler, and &quot;Gold&quot; is  Alexander Chee's story of a young man of Korean and Argentinean descent who  confronts both his mixed heritage and his evolving sexuality. Here, too,  are timely variations on such topics as coming out, breaking up, sex and  AIDS, growing up gay and ethnic, gay marriages, and gay men and fatherhood.  In what may be the most diverse entry in this ever-evolving series, Men on  Men 2000 celebrates what it means to be a gay man at the beginning of the  new millennium.&quot; - abstract from Intermale	2000-07-15

It soon became clear that Khalid had not given up on the idea of sex. He sat by the rudder, guiding the felucca further west.  Strange birds swept down from the sky and called to each other, before  swooping down on the water and floating close to the boat.'Birds don't mind  what we do,' Khalid explained wickedly. 'They've seen this before and they  pretend not to notice.'<br />It's 1925 and the deluxe cruiser carrying the  young gigolo Jeremy Hessling has docked at Luxor. Jeremy dreams of being  dominated by the pharaohs of old, but quickly becomes involved with someone  more accessible -- Khalid, a young man of exceptional beauty.<br />Jeremy is  used to trading on his looks in his profession but, as he finds himself in  an escalating adventure of sexual intrigue, he realises there's more than  one way to bribe his way out of a bad situation. And instead of the opulent  temples of his imagination, he finds love and sex among the crumbling ruins  where the Nile still flows, just as it did centuries ago.

Expressions of such an elusive quarry are counted among society's most sacred and valuable treasures. One such treasure is this collection of  photographs by James Houston. His photographs speak of the heroic, the  eternal, the protean visage of our species. Beguiling, seductive, and  memorable, they are postcards from humanity's Golden Age. <br />In these pages  you will find light and shadow moulded into sculptural forms - sometimes as  abstractions of edged plains and gleaming surfaces, at times as glowing  über-physiques, taut and poised in Olympian poses. The secret of James  Houston's great gift is to invoke in the consciousness of his audience a  palpable vision of human beauty sensed, but rarely seen. James Houston is  one of Australia's leading fashion photographers, contributing to Italian  Harper's Bazaar and Australian Vogue, among photographic awards and made  him an inspiration to all those who set out on their personal odyssey in  search of art, truth and beauty. RAW is his first book.- from Verlag Der  Kunst	2000-07-14

But Platt Lynes was also a myth-maker with a  photographic obsession that remained mostly unpublished until after his  death. In collaboration with his male nude models he was able to transcend  time and place - these images simultaniously glance back as a  &quot;homage&quot; to Greek mythology and athleticism, and look forward to  the modern, urban eroticism of Robert Mapplethorpe and Bruce Weber. This  book breaks down his body of work into distinct sections. The portraits  include such luminaries of twentieth century art and society as Thomas  Mann, Igor Stravinsky and Gertrude Stein, as well as fellow lens-men Cecil  Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, and it is clear from the lighting and the  often surreal framing that he was a master of the form. It is in his  extensive nude images that his admiration for the male body and his expert  technique are truly brought together.&quot; - text from Intermale	2000-07-14

Scrutiny of implementation of the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy on gays and lesbians in the military reveals a situation far worse than it was before. &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; continues to be a flagrant  violation of the First Amendment, effectively silencing the ability to  define one's self. Just to say the words &quot;I'm gay&quot; is grounds for  removal - not only from the military, but from a job, from future  employment, and from a community of friends, sometimes family. To be  allowed to exist in an environment where you are encouraged to be all that  you can be - as long as you don't tell anyone about it, and as long as you  don't act on your convictions - is psychological torture, and absurd  government policy. 'Conduct Unbecoming' serves both as a vote for more  enlightened government policy, and as a testament to the courage of gays  and lesbians who have served, fought, and died for this country.	1999-12-12

T. stories that he originally wrote for Bound &amp; Gagged Magazine, and which were first published between 1993 and 1997. These short pieces  are basically written in a lighter mode than many of L. T.'s other tales, mostly because they are presented as  basically true accounts by the man telling the story. A few are actually  based on fact, but the author now admits even these have been considerably  en-hanced by his ever lusty imagination. We are thus treated to an  action-packed collection of incredibly arousing short stories, plus a couple  that were deemed a bit heavy for the B&amp;G format and hence never previously  published. The book starts with some comments by Bob Wingate, founder and  publisher of Bound &amp; Gagged, and concludes with some correspondence - to  and from the author - concerning the proper definition of slave.	1999-11-16

English and              German, their first instinct is to take the other prisoner, but as their main preoccupation              is survival, this is  clearly not possible.

CNN's presence is felt in every part of the world, its brand name synonymous with news from               everywhere, all the time. The same  energy, boldness, and responsiveness to market opportunities that                defined CNN's early years makes it today's company to watch and learn  from in the business of               international news.                CNN: Making News in the Global Market chronicles how founder Ted Turner  transformed his               Atlanta-based company into a credible  international news service in spite of his activist social agenda                that challenged well-established journalistic traditions. Furthermore,  his company's aggressive               strategy of covering news whenever  and wherever it happens, of breaking the news first, of going live                from the scene, has frequently put the company in the uncomfortable  position of shaping the events it               relentlessly covers.                This book uses first-hand accounts from many insiders, incorporating  interviews with Ted Turner and               company managers, with those  who gather, produce, market and globally distribute the news, and with                those who have signed on as CNN partners. The result is a  revealing look at how an American               company took shape around a  strong leader, how it built and projected a world-class identity, and now                prepares for stiff international competition.	1999-11-02
