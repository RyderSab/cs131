Author points out, in a fun way, Madonna's hypocrisies, contradictions, and downright vile bits of trivia. Book is certainly dated, I'd like to see an updated version, but for a younger Madonna fan, this is a good way to see what the real pop tart was like when she was sleeping her way to the top. For example, Madonna has been a vegetarian in the past not because of any feelings about animals, but because vegetarians are supposedly paler.  <br />I'm sure her fans want these books destroyed, so much for free speech. \\"Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about Madonna, what was I thinking!\\" <br />This will do until someone she's ruined or stolen from gets the nerve to print a book of their own. <br />	2005-07-28

I don't know for sure whether there was a conspiracy to keep the scrolls out of the hands of anyone who wasn't part of a small, elite group of Catholics, but it sure seems like it. There's really no other explanation for why all the scrolls were not released, not even to highly qualified scholars, and one excue after another kept them hidden for far too long. Some of those Catholic keepers actually felt like they owned this history.  <br />For the \\"International Team\\" to insist that the scrolls are pre-Christian is insane. They were no doubt written in the 1st century, and possible some were written in the 2nd.  <br />I have a different picture of the peace loving Essenes after reading this. I'd like to see an update. <br />	2005-06-28

Hughes book is kind of interesting, but falls into the whole Thr Right Hates Technology trap. Claims that \\"just as European rascists wanted to deny voting rights to Africans, human-racists want to deny rights to intelligent animals and robots.\\" Huh? <br />Another Huh? was when he criticizes someone for saying that diet and exercise is the best way to control one's weight, not wait for a money-hungry diet industry to invent a Magic Diet Pill. Hughes says he \\"expects the man to lecture about masturbation next.\\" What??? <br />At least he picks on the leftists who say they want an end to world hunger, but when a company tries to do just that, the leftists don't want it because a company might make a profit. Shutting down businesses are more important than ending starvation. Same with energy. \\"We need solution to the energy problem!\\" OK, lets' drill \\"No No, we can't drill!\\" Well, lets' use coal, \\"No! Can't burn coal!\\" How about nuclear power?

I travel a lot, especially to National Parks and Battlefields.  I laughed a bit, even a few times out loud, but after the first few chapters it grew a bit weary on me. It unfortunately was the same tale at every place the author went. Fat women in bad shorts, ugly rowdy kids, and dull visitor's centers. Yes, we know tourist traps are full of chuncky women in tight Bermudas, but didn't Bryson see any hideous men with them?  Bryson seems almost content to head back to his flea motel and down a six-pack in bed. Not quite the type of guy to pick on everybody else for their looks.   I would still recommend it for frequent travelers, but be prepared for the dislocated American (he moved to England many years back) to be really critical of people he sees along his kind of dull trip.	2005-02-25

Even the most childish child's minds won't enjoy this sniveling mess. Her first book, \\"Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful\\" or something to that effect, had been turned into a line of miniskirts for lil gals, telling me that this line of silly books was written to cash in on the kids' toy and clothes market. There's no other explanation for the horrid writing. I also have to be a bit suspect at the rave ratings here. Since Madonna's website once begged fans to buy multiple copies of her last bomb of a cd to push it up the charts, perhaps her fans are being asked to write up reviews.  <br />When considering buying this rubbish, remember, her fans are dabbling in a Hollywood cult and wearing red string to ward off some evil eye. And these books cater to those same people daft enough to be that superstitious.  <br />Funny, this \\"author\\" and best buddy to kids has raised a daughter of her own who reportedly has a very foul mouth. Mommy herself has been known to cuss out young fans wanting an autograph. <br />Buy the classics instead.

I thought the book might have something on another collecting area, photos form the 19th century of deceased individuals propped up with relatives. This seemed to be popular at a time when many persons, especially children, died before ever having a photo of themselves taken, so families would prop them up as if they were alive.

Author adds chapter on alleged witch hunts of the 50s, perhaps he should read about the real attemped Communist infiltration of Hollywood before crying about, say, Edward G Robinson. Compares \\"censorship\\" to Sean Penn and Dixie Chicks. Excuse me, but if there WERE government censorship, these overpaid actors and singers would not have been allowed to voice an opinion. If we as the public don't wish to buy their products, it is not censorship, but freedom of choice. <br />Author simply got the idea from Kenneth Anger (whose books are inconsistent and full of unfounded gossip) and thought he'd do an updated version. <br />If you're 30 or older and have read about old scandals, you won't find anything new here.	2004-10-13

Neither she nor her husband Martin ever flew their aircraft, Osa was often protected by an off-camera sharpshooter, and as for adventure, maybe, but she became an alcoholic due in part to depression over being away from home so often. She smiles on-camera as Martin belittles her. She seemed to be a tool for Martin, a cute face who helped him sell half-bogus and often times staged films. One book they wrote deals with cannibals. Howeverm tha cannibal theory has been all but debunked, and they knowlingly filmed head-curing ceremonies, passing this off as cannibalism. They starved animals out of their hiding areas for the sake of a photo. <BR>To cal this woman a great American Hero or something is silly. Want a real female hero from Kansas?

My surgeon recommended this to me to lose weight before undergoing a non-weight related surgery. I have tried everything.

IT WORKS. Sometimes I was so full I was afraid of gaining weight but it still came off. Don't just buy low-carb products. You HAVE to read about it. Just because a label says it's low-carb doesn't mean it's really low-carb. Please ignore the ads for low-carb beer (ha!) and low-carb frozen processed foods. You have to know the facts and the food companies won't tell you. It's hard for awhile to give up breads, potatoes, and other things, but I'm telling you, it works!

I used to just love these guys back in high school, but this book doesn't go far enough. I was 3/4 of the way finished before I got to the days when they made it big. Too much on Jerry's early days, a lot of Jerry everywhere! As usual, the Bobs, especially Bob 2, and Alan are in the back somewhere, and you wonder what's up with them. Nothing revealing, other than Bob 2 apparently left his wife when they began to hit it big, Bob 1 was a drinker, and Jerry is an even bigger creep than I imagined. Some good details into the first \\"video\\" and who some of the people in them were, but nothing on the videotapes with Rod and Donut. No mention of Laraine Newman, their fascination with donuts and pirates, how their politics always seemed so leftist yet they just wanted to make big bucks and now run Big Entertainment companies, etc etc. Nothing about the concept of the power domes, who the fat kid on the exercise machine was, Bob 1's daughter being on the Shout LP cover, so much is left out. Some good pics, but I'm sure more could have been dug up. Sounds like the authors did most research via telephone interviews. They talked to General Boy, but I did that back in the 80s, when a friend and I rang him up on the phone! We lived in Ohio then and both Robert and his wife would chat with us like we were old friends!  I'm mixed. There are some great old insights and pieces of trivia, but it really could have been longer and told more about the 80s and on. Devotees should get it because nothing else is there, but be prepared to feel like you've had a delicious appetizer without dinner.  Later thoughts: The book that Devo was so fascinated with, \\"The Beginning Was The End\\" and the basis for their De-evolution theory, has anyone else read it? I found a copy and it's wretched. The author uses photos to compare blacks with various apes! Why were they so interested in this book?! And I forgot about Jerry's \\"I was standing there was my friend was killed\\" story. According to the book he stretches the truth quite often. So was he there or is he making this up too? I agree with another reviewer that said he would be basically pushing up daisies before listening to the last couple of albums! The first two were great, the rest, a few good songs, but popish. Musik for Insomniaks bored me silly, I can see where it got the title. This book may be out of print after this run, so pass it around like a Casale galpal!	2004-06-21

Even a photo of Marilyn Monroe leads the reader to think it was of her dead body. Anger just makes up things at times, and reduces legends like Buster Keaton to a \\"drunk who died obscure\\" which it completely untrue. He hints that the famous Gish sisters were lovers, then backs it up with...nothing. He also claims in a photo caption that Harold Lloyd fathered many illegitimate children, but again, no proof. Just a caption. What would you expect from a friend of Aleister Crowley? Plus the second book's Reagan-will-nuke-the-world paranoia only dates it to the 80s. The author has sympathy for a clap-ridden prostitute who died most likely from a botched abortion, but ignores the evidence and blames a comedian who had nothing to do with it. Writing about scandal is one thing but to make it up is nothing short of the Weekly World News. This is no way to learn about old Hollywood, kids. The best-worst part of the book? Where Anger makes up stupid dialogue from a past event that he wasn't at. Case in point: A girl claimed to have been raped by Alexander Pantages. Anger actually writes that the girl ran screaming, pointing at Alex, shouting, \\"There he is the great god Pan!\\" Yecch. Plus, thanks to the angry Anger, Errol Flynn is now known as an alleged rapist, and people still believe the whole Hearst-Ince \\"murder\\".

True he was not educated, but to say he was illiterate is false. I've seen photocopies of his journal he kept during WWI, and it's clear he studied his Army manuals and learned Morse code and practiced it. The author also makes the mistake of relaying to us conversations that took place between Buster and his mother-in-law, both deceased of course. How would she know what was said? These were about things Buster would have discussed with no one else. It's an intro to people unfamiliar with Buster, but by no means accurate.

Any sane person is left wondering what the hell this author DOES like? I agree that bad sitcoms and People magazine are trashy, but this guy knocks everything! He seems to speak against British pretentiousness, but enjoys sabbaticals in pricey London. He was well-off enough to attend posh universities, all the while knocking the lower-priced ones. He slams the lower and middle classes, while pretending to be &quot;above classism.&quot; Not a page goes by where he doesn't insult Reagan. This snob even hates graduation ceremonies, university logos, the flag, and the bicentennial back in '76. The piece de resistance (he DOES love French snobbery) is when he blames the US Navy for Lockerbie. What DOES this clown like? Oh, check out the photo in back. Aren't ugly toupees and shoes without socks BAD?	2004-02-21

However, Mr Peabody's Apples is so dull, she apparently did write it. If your child has trouble sleeping, this book should do it. Another mediocre lesson in humility and kindness from a woman who seems void of those qualities herself. I'm sure fans will write glowing reviews, but what would you expect them to do? Honestly, the books are almost laughable in their \\"lessons.\\" Stick to real writers. Don't believe it? Look at the number of used ones already for sale. Definitely not a keeper.	2004-02-08
