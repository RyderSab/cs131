Jack Crabbe, the geriatric home resident of the original novel who'd told of his experiences in the West, always peripheral to the events we all know of, returns in this sequel to tell of his life after the Little Big Horn fight.   <br /> <br />As the only white survivor of Little Big Horn, Jack wanders broke and almost naked into Deadwood, SD, to encounter his old acquaintance from Dodge,  City, KS, Wild Bill Hickock, in time to be present for the Aces and Eights scenario.  Naturally, Crabbe gives the eye-witness account of the even a bit differently than you've heard before.   <br /> <br />Thereafter, Crabbe wanders back to Dodge, Tombstone, elsewhere, in time to be present for the OK Corral fight, offering up another side of the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, the Clantons and Bat Masterson.  Then eastward to the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Queen Victoria, Bertie, Sitting Bull and Elizabeth Custer. <br /> <br />As a grand finale he manages to be with Sitting Bull for the assassination of the great chief of the Souix. <br /> <br />A great follow-up book to Little Big Man.  Too bad it took so many decades to appear. <br />	2005-01-27

Old men in geriatric homes throughout the US were claiming to be the 'real' John Wilkes Booth, Jesse James, Billy the Kid and other notorious figures in the history of the American west.  Berger created a spin-off character, Jack Crabbe, who claimed to be none of these, but managed to be present for a surprising number of pivotal events of the 19th Century.  He also claimed to know many of the characters involved, including Sitting Bull, Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, Wyatt Earp and his brothers, Bat Masterson, George Armstrong Custer and others. <br /> <br />In addition to being a great read and informative piece of historical fiction, this novel became a model for the anti-hero of a number of other historical fiction series and works.  The most notable of these is the George MacDonald Frazer, Flashman books. <br /> <br />Berger has done a signal job of turning over the rocks of history, finding twists and turns normally not part of the legends, and weaving them into a character and plot unsurpassed in American historical fiction.	2005-01-27

It's the sequel to several other books I haven't read, but I don't believe my enjoyment of it suffered as a   result.    The setting is Mississippi during the early 1890s when the memories of the Civil War and Reconstruction were still vivid.  A backwoods, locally influential family finds itself under siege by a powerful logging company from Chicago, a new breed of demagogue politicians and family wounds from the Civil War that refuse to heal while the parties involved remain alive.  The book is reminiscent of some of the better western genre novels that qualify as `literature'.  The setting portrayed is believable, the plot, crisp, the characters, real.      This is the story of a microcosm of humanity during a pivotal time in history.  The US hasn't yet gone to war with Spain, hasn't assumed the mantle of an international power with foreign aims. US Territories were roughly the same as they are  today, minus Puerto Rico and Guam.  As Coolidge truthfully stated once, \\"The business of America is business\\".  There was no time in history when this manifested itself more forcefully than it did during the 1890s.    Street manages to bring alive a forgotten time and context in the book, well worth the time to read and absorb carefully.	2005-01-24

Forty years ago Hawkins, an astronomer discovered the function of Stonehenge by using an IBM computer. That function was more incredible than all the fanciful notions dreamed up to explain the monument between the time it was abandoned during the early Bronze Age (around 1500 BC) and the early modern age of computers.<br /><br />The Knight/Lomas attempt to throw a new brand of mysticism into one of the most amazing discoveries about the intellects of men we've usually considered primitive does nothing to discredit the achievement. This book has as much validity as the claims almost a thousand years ago that the structure was placed there by Merlin through the use of magic.<br /><br />The men who've studied and dug beneath this shocking accomplishment of pre-history during the past centuries have uncovered the tools used to build it. Stone tools. Deer antlers. There's mystery here, but the mystery involves human determination, persistence and motive.<br /><br />As for the Knights Templar claims by the authors: The history of the Templars is well documented. They are worthy of awe. The Templars need no modern-day fanciful fictions to add to their place in history. No Foucault's Pendulums need obscure a strange group of men who dedicated themselves to what they believed until all who could be captured were excommunicated and executed.<br /><br />I'd suggest readers interested in these subjects read Hawkins (about Stonehenge). If there's interest in the Templars read the actual histories. You won't get anything approaching magic, but you won't need it. You'll come away as intrigued and mystified as you would have if you'd read (and believed) this book. But the foundation for your awe will be justified.<br /><br />The main problem with this book is that it's written by two men who haven't dug under Stonehenge and haven't observed the function for themselves. An electrical engineer and an advertising man. Go to the experts and don't bother with this book.<br /><br />However, if you happen to be blessed with the ability to become excited over fabrication and fantasy, buy it. This book is for you.	2005-01-15

The breadth of his writing career cuts too wide a swath for such a statement.  However, The American Claimant, obscure though it is, is certainly among his best.    The American Claimant is about Americans, the way they view themselves, the way they are viewed by others through the eyes of a British nobleman.  Even though a century has passed since the book was written, most of the acute observations are as true today as when it was written.    A family of Americans descended from an eldest son of a British Earl, Lord Rossmore, has been claiming the title for many generations.  The actual young Earl, filled with idealism, decides to abdicate, to change places with the American claimant.  He travels to the US with the intention of contacting Colonel Mulberry Sellers, the claimant, to exchange places.  Sellers is an American dreamer, always down on his luck, an inventor, a philanthropist of sorts.    Through a series of Keystone Kops misfortunes the Earl loses his letters of credit, assumes the clothing of bank robber from the west, takes up life in a boarding house of workmen, determined to make a life on his own and abandon the wealth of his past.    This is the setting for The American Claimant.  The Earl discovers the American dream isn't quite as it is cracked up to be, discovers his taste for the common man is far less palatable in close proximity.  Every attempt to find employment is thwarted until he discovers himself to be a worthy hack as an artist.    Fate takes a hand in the lives of the young Earl and the heir of the claimant, leading to a zesty, if predictable wrap-up.    As with every book by Mark Twain, this one is fun.  It is astute.  It is thought provoking.  It is well written, the characters sympathetic and mostly believable, the plot, circuitous in the best Mark Twain tradition.  It also contains an element of subtle wisdom and tongue-in-cheek observation more finely honed than in many of theearlier writings.    The author declared in the beginning that this would be a story without weather.  He held to his promise, but in the end provided weather for the story in an appendix, for those who must have it.    I don't know why this book has fallen by the wayside.  It shouldn't have done so.    I recommend it for any reader, but especially for American ones.	2005-01-14

When the laws turned backward on themselves and became an instrument of the only person in the community who ignored the law completely, the law abiders all became accessories to a remedy forbidden by their own laws.   <br /> <br />Afterward, the machinery of justice finally cranked up and spent an enormous amount of energy trying to make these reluctant lawbreakers pay for the crime of doing what the law was hired to do, and failed. <br /> <br />If you believe the machinery of justice is the friend to the common citizen, you don't want to read this book.   <br /> <br />If you have a crack-house the police `can't do anything about' operating in the abandoned house down the block from you, you don't want to read this book.   <br /> <br />If your wife or daughter is being stalked by some guy who has a history of rape or homicide, but the police can't stop him, don't read this book.   <br /> <br />If there's a guy in your neighborhood who's been in prison for child molesting, you definitely don't want to read this book. <br /> <br />Probably no one should read this book.	2004-12-18

Modern man hides in the forest of the known, secure and out of reach of meaning for his existence. <br /> <br />This book is not to be taken lightly, to be read and tossed aside for the next mystery or adventure story.  It is not about escape from, but rather about escape to a reality most of humanity hasn't the courage to acknowledge, much less enter to find a different foundation for continuing. <br /> <br />It's tempting not to recommend this book at all without a certified statement from prospective buyers to read the words carefully, to examine the phrases and the meaning behind the phrases.

You almost certainly wouldn't have found this book, otherwise.    The reason for reading the letters of Dylan Thomas have to lie behind the poetry, the desire to know the man.  This book will give you a peek into his personal life, a respect for his approach to poetry, to people, to most of the sides of human interaction you can only guess at by reading the poetry.    I believe if you love the poetry of Dylan Thomas this book will make you happier for knowing a piece of that other side of him, the side known only to his most intimate friends.    I didn't buy this book.  It was given to me by a friend who knew I love poetry and respected the poetry of Thomas.  The book sat for a number of years on my bookshelf before I picked it up and began reading it when there seemed to be nothing else of interest.

Because records of the events have mostly been destroyed, or were deliberately never made, Haseloff has been forced to assume a lot about what happened and why it happened.  It's generally a good job.    The legalities of trying Comanches and Kiowans raiding into North Texas while residing 'out of reach' in Oklahoma weren't vague at the time.  The raiders understood enough of the law to know they were immune from prosecution by Texans for depredations in Texas if they escaped to Oklahoma.  In this instance, the laws were ignored.  Two men responsible for a raid that resulted in the deaths of several freighters and torture of one were arrested, taken back to Texas, tried and hanged.    From a strictly practical perspective, it was probably the right method of dealing with the event, though illegal.  Even though Comanche raids continued for several years after this trial, the security of refuge provided by the Oklahoma Territory was never again to be trusted.  Comanches who remained at war with whites in Texas were forced to remain on the high plains and face white retribution for their acts.  This eventually allowed Colonel Ranald McKenzie to destroy the entire horse-herd of the raiding bands, putting them afoot and ending their ability to conduct raids without exterminating the entire tribe.    The fate of Penateka Comanche, the Karankawa, the Lipan Apache, the Fara'on Apache, and many other tribes caught in the vicegrip of Spanish and Anglo migration into the American West and Southwest is a bloody illustration of the other alternative.      The author has done a good job of reconstructing the events, the setting, the characters and the context.  I recommend it for anyone interested in that phase of Texas history.	2004-12-12

Many use no device at all.  For this reason I've had to do some self-examination about how I'd rate this book, and why.<br /><br />I don't wish to convey the idea to anyone that this book will help in the practice of dowsing.  It won't.  If you practice dowsing you probably already have a method you consider best for you.  If you are a novice, you'll probably discover as other dowsers have done, that the method or external device you use makes little, or no difference.  Raymond Grace uses an impressive spring-loaded wand-like device made by Joe Smith, in Arkansas, for his water-purification/healing demonstrations, but he readily admits it is only for the showmanship aspects, just to keep the audience interested.<br /><br />On the other hand, Branson has done a thorough job of presenting through a series of sketches the amazing and imaginative array of tools dowsers use and have used in the past in the pursuit of their dowsing practices.  Many of these devices are complicated, some are expensive, and some are deliberate scams elaborately constructed to take money from the unwary.<br /><br />If you have an interest in dowsing I don't hesitate to recommend this book as one of the many available to help you understand the practice.  I'd only suggest that you keep it on the level of practice, experimentation, education.  Don't take it too seriously.	2004-12-12

I'll begin by restating information located in the blurb inside the front cover:<br /><br />\\"T.C. Lethbridge, who died in 1971, was an archaeologist, psychic researcher, dowser and explorer.  He was for thirty years Director of Excavations for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society and for the University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.  He was on three Arctic expeditions, several Hebridean exploratory expeditions and two voyages to the Baltic in square-rigged sailing ships.  He was also, as Colin Wilson wrote, 'one of the most remarkable and original minds in parapsychology'.\\"<br /><br />What isn't included in the blurb, but is offered by Lethbridge in his book, is that for many years he used dowsing to locate and identify archaeological ruins, establish excavation priorities, and many other matters in his life.  When this book was written he made this admission because he was retired and the information could no longer bring sneers rebukes from his peers and damage his professional prospects.  Lethbridge harbored no illusions about the open-mindedness of the scientific community concerning matters such as dowsing.<br /><br />Lethbridge did his best to make a 'science' of dowsing.  The methods he describes worked for him.  Evidently, he believed those methods were necessary.<br /><br />Other dowsers, myself included, use different methods which, we believe, work equally well.  On the other hand, many of us have used Lethbridges methods and found them to be successful.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in dowsing, either as a practicioner, or just as an interested bystander who'd like to learn about dowsing from a scientist who dowsed but couldn't admit it to his fellow scientists.	2004-12-12

The author sent me a galley copy of this book for review.     The basic story's a simple one.  A young man, orphaned as a child, haunted by unexceptional experience, loss, solitude, is suicidal.  After an attempted suicide he encounters a metaphysical being of the negative genre, makes a deal of the not- exactly- traditional- Faustian variety to continue with life a while.  Our hero then discovers an angel, who's been watching him all along, and becomes something of a pawn in the struggle between two vague forces, a tug-of-war for his soul, his future, his manner of dying.    The plotting is fast-paced, characters are well developed and amusing, dialogue is mostly crisp and well handled.  The book is a fun read, and although the author clearly intended a higher message for it, I don't believe it's entirely successful in that regard for mature humans faced with suicidal tendencies, depression and the dark closed vessel life sometimes becomes for many people.      That's the reason I've chosen to rate this book as 5 stars for young adults.  I believe it might be mildly helpful as a thought-provoking read with energy, entertainment and an understanding of some of the mysteries of life for young people just beginning their stroll along the tight-rope.  The theme might seem slightly frayed on the edges for more sophisticated readers.	2004-12-12

Even though the power of daily affirmations is well established as a means of freeing ones self from negative habits of thinking and is used with great success by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, the process is usually relatively simple and straightforward.  The process and techniques could easily be contained in a folded pamphlet. <br /> <br />Stuart Wilde expanded the entire concept of affirmations in this book.  He carries it into a wide-ranging field of metaphysics, manipulation and, probably, magic.  The concepts aren't new, but Wilde's approach is always interesting, pithy, usually helpful, and readable. <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about Stuart Wilde, and similarly mixed feelings about this book.  It's good, it's effective and it delivers what is offered on the cover.  A means of taking back control of your life. <br /> <br />On the downside, I suppose I'd have preferred to see a stronger division between manipulative energy and merely self-improvement.

The Bible addressed the problem, probably in the first surviving form, by demanding that people walk away from others with a spear or spade, dig a hole, and cover it.

That battle and the results can be found easily enough in the nooks and crannies of actual history and autobiography.  The Albert Fountain homicide in New Mexico, the various works gradually seeping out of the cracks about Mountain Meadows, Elfigo Baca, the Salt War and the Catron Gang and even the Pat Garrett homicide all portray a time in our history when county elections were a life and death matter.

The book differs from anything he's published in the past and more nearly resembles the reflections of writers better known for non-fiction works than for fiction.<br />On The Mesa is the story of one of the skirmishes in the long war over the encroachments of 'post-modern' civilization into Northern New Mexico.  Those battles are usually portrayed best in fiction works because they constitute an epic.  Bradford's books, Red Sky at Morning and So Far From Heaven are two of the first of this genre, followed by the several Milagro Beanfield novels by Nichols.<br />On The Mesa lacks the penetrating humor readers find attractive in the fiction books by Nichols, but they'll probably be pleased by the reverence, the maturity of tone and the underlying sweet melancholy recognition of an inevitable loss in a noble fight to preserve a facet of the past.	2004-06-11

After the war he came to the United States, probably because Hitler's scientists in the bomb and rocket programs were thought to be better suited to work with the western nations than the Soviet Union.  For most of the scientists this probably proved to be true.<br />Not so, Wilhelm Reich.  The Soviets couldn't have been more thorough or cruel in suppressing his work and punishing him for discovering Orgone.  <br />Reich's publications involving Orgone energy during the 1950s came into disfavor with the powers-that-be.  The word 'Orgone' was banned from the English language for use in the US.  All publications containing the word, the concept and the devices described in this book were destroyed and forbidden.<br />Reich was placed in a prison where he finally died.<br />Maybe Orgone Accumulators and other devices described in this book really don't work.  This work explains how to try them for yourself and make your own decisions.  <br />Meanwhile, the US Government certainly had strong feelings for many years about whether you ought to be trying out Reich's ideas, methods, techniques for improving your health, or even allow the words to exist in your most secret thoughts.  If you trust them you can conclude it's for your own good. <br />If you don't know whether you trust them you can buy this book and build yourself an Orgone Accumulator for your own garden, house or yard and form your own opinions.  If Orgone doesn't exist, as the US Government claims, or if it exists and is of great importance to human health, as Reich claims, you can't hurt yourself by trying it. <br />On the other hand, if Reich is correct you can't afford not to know about Orgone.	2004-06-09

The time setting is the 1950s and the seven-year drought we experienced during those years.  The plot/theme is the end of the era of independence and freedom among cow men ... the time when they told themselves the drought forced them to sell themselves to the government to receive hay in return for their souls and their pasts.<br />I think of this book as a companion read to Abbey's, Brave Cowboy and McMurtry's, Hud (the book).  All three writers were capturing a time and an attitude representing an end of an era when ranchers continued to curse the government out of habit while accepting welfare money as gracefully as the city poor they despised for doing so.  <br />Kelton's book is as good as the other two, maybe better.	2004-06-09

He wouldn't have cut it if it wasn't in his way, or if there'd been a gate nearby.  Thus begins the book with a scene that tells much about the main character.<br />Burns is a man who doesn't merely cling to ideals of loyalty, privacy and individual freedom.  His internal machinery accepts no alternative at any level.  Jack Burns is a man who won't cut a fence unless it stands in the way of where he wants to go. He recognizes the existence of the creeping encroachments and compromises to his choices and ignores them. The modern acquiescence by the rest of society is foreign to him.<br />Burns descends the mesa into Albuquerque, encounters modern city life and is battered by it without 'losing' in the usual sense of the word, and leaves on the run from the legal instruments intended to keep us all on the straight and narrow.  The end is inevitable.<br />Readers who know Albuquerque will enjoy the ride across the 'Volcans', the places in the Rio Grande Valley still recognizable despite the years since Abbey wrote the book, the harrowing climb up the Sandias pursued by the military and law enforcement community.  Those who don't know Albuquerque or New Mexico will appreciate the type of individual Burns portrays:  a man born too late, unable to compromise.<br />I haven't seen the movie mentioned by other reviewers.  I also didn't see the shortcomings of the book mentioned by several.  I saw only a writer who created a character much as Abbey saw himself, as many people today see themselves, and a plot that carried those traits through to the end.  No one, I imagine Abbey would say, can dodge the steamroller.	2004-06-09

Many of those involve left memoirs, but those are becoming difficult to find, as most are now out of print.  Speer's Spandau writings are among the endangered species.  <br />Anyone who wishes to understand the minds of the men who made the Reich work and particularly the mind of Adolph Hitler can do so by the evidence of their deeds at one level.  However, the records of their thoughts, conversations, behavior and rationalizations while they did so is certainly a facet of understanding.  The writings of Von Manstein, Doenitz, Rommel, Guderian, and the diaries of Joseph Goebbels are each worth the reading in this sense.  As is Albert Speer.<br />Speer was imprisoned longer than any of the other members of Hitler's inner circle.  He had many years of solitude to contemplate his deeds and reflect on how and why he came to be imprisoned in Spandau.  Maybe these musings qualify as revisionist history.  Maybe they're merely self-serving rationalizations.  But his anecdotes will definitely add to your understanding of the 3rd Reich.  You don't have to believe everything he says, but it's worth reading it and making the choice for yourself.<br />Speer thought of himself as a 'nice guy'.  You can't make an informed decision as to whether it was true without reading what he had to say.  In the end most of us believe we are 'nice people' and are justified in whatever horrendous deeds we pursue.	2004-06-08

The members of the group were almost entirely unfamiliar with the I Ching.  <br />In their midst, however, was one of the foremost non-Chinese I Ching scholars alive, Wilhelm.  Hass asked him to give a few lectures to the group to help them understand the history, use and concepts behind the I Ching.  <br />As an introduction to the Book of Changes by a master these eight lectures cover an enormous amount of ground in an easy, understandable way.  The translations from German to English by Cary F. Baynes are, as always, excellent.  <br />I'd recommend this book as an accompanyment to the Baynes or Richard John Lynn translations of the Book of Changes, certainly.  But for anyone using the I Ching in any translation, whatever the level of scholarship, this book will probably be a source of useful information you didn't have before.	2004-06-03

They cover a wide span of subject matter ranging from critiques of the prose style of another writer to the author's construction of the Old Testament and God from the perspective of Satan. In addition to Letters From Earth (Satan's), the contents includes Papers of the Adam Family, The Damned Human Race, Something About Repentance, Was the World Made For Man, In the Animal's Court, The Intelligence of God, The Lowest Animal and others.<br />Readers who are offended by careful examinations of the meaning and implications of holy or sacred writings of the Old Testiment will not enjoy this book.  The author, whatever his actual religious beliefs, probably wasn't an Old Testiment Christian.  In this series of short writings he takes specific stories from the OT and holds them into the light away from the long traditions that accompany them in most of our minds.  He examines the evidence of the stories for hints of what sort of creature God must be if the OT is true.  He extropolates what Satan might be. <br />I'm an admirer of this author and I believe everything he ever wrote is worth reading and digesting.  I put this book alongside his best.  But I also admit that if I harbored a microbe of religious fanatic somewhere inside me I'd be hard-pressed to enjoy reading Letters From the Earth.	2004-05-30

That's true.  This is a book you should probably read before you go there, or even contemplate going there.  <br />Visiting Chaco and other ancient ruin sites in the Southwest is an adventure.  If you'd like to see these ruins innocent of any understanding of what you are looking at, of the people who built them, of what's known, believed, speculated about concerning their mysteries, don't buy this book.  You'll still enjoy seeing it, but you'll do so with approximately the same level of comprehension as the thousands of others who visit there every year.<br />This book won't give you a thorough knowledge of Chaco or the Chacoan Culture.  No book will.  No 100 books will.  The fact is we only know a lot about those people when compared to knowing absolutely nothing about them.  <br />But if you want to know what's known and believed about pre-columbians in New Mexico, this is a good place to begin.	2004-05-26

Unfortunately, it suffers from being a bit outdated, having been written before the population explosion in the southwest during the past 20 years.  The descriptions are frequently of remains and ruins no longer in existence, plundered, or merely part of new, cutesy 'discovered' communities of gingerbread and bricabrack.  A lot of the ghost towns, I might have said, have been reincarnated.  <br />Even so, there's not a better book anywhere about the ghost towns of New Mexico as they existed 20-30 years ago.	2004-05-26

Everything seemed too goooood, what with a female PI big sister, illegal aliens, poverty, ya dee yaa dee yaa.  I'm honestly not certain why I tried it on.<br />I'm glad I did.  Boston's changed a lot from the city I lived in during the early 1960s, but not so much it isn't recognizable and enjoyable.  The characters don't beat the reader over the head with the social ills we all know about.  We aren't preached to with in-your-face feminism, mostly, and there's a degree of finesse when it happens at all.  In those instances it passes for a more-or-less legitimate young female with attitude, arguing about who gets to drive and why, who pays the check, etc etc etc, realism we don't have to like in the character to believe in a way to suggest it's not so much a social bludgeoning as actual characterization.<br />I was never tempted to trash this book before I finished it.

I'm uncertain about the others, but I was a lot younger in those days and Sci-Fi was a lot younger.  A book of this genre didn't require as much to impress us.<br />During the past few years I've made an effort to go back and read a lot of books I loved or hated when I was younger.  A lot of those I loved then were pure drivel to me now, and a lot of those I hated cause me to realize what a shallow level I was reading on.

Neu's book traces the history of US/Japanese relations from the beginnings during the mid-19th Century.  His exploration follows the forces working within each government, the overall East Asian contexts, the rapid emergence of Japan from a feudal island to an empire culminating in the WWII war in the Pacific.  This includes the almost forgotten yellow-peril scares and anti-Japanese racism in California that did much to influence US policies during the early 20th Century. <br />Japanese expansion into Siberia, Manchuria, Mongolia and China while the western powers were pre-occupied during WWI resulted in deep mistrust of them during the early post-war years.  However, following the Washington Agreement the Japanese withdrew and settled into an era of peaceful expansion that ended in 1924, when the US reinforced the Gentleman's Agreement and adopted an immigration policy based on rabid racial feelings in California.  <br />This move restricted immigration by Japanese to the US to 274 per annum and repudiated racial equality. In Japan, the reaction was fierce.  Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi was seriously injured by a right-wing assassin for his position in negotiations with the US.  The beginnings of a new era began then.<br />The book will leave the reader with a good comprehension of how the evolution of human affairs can lead to two flawed human societies preoccupied with nationalistic goals and concerns, shifting internal power structures and perceptions conditions of minimum 'required' conditions and security lead to armed confrontation and eventual destruction of Japan as a military power.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in how East Asia came to be as it is, how the US, to some extent came to be as it is and how misunderstandings and failures to develop and communicate cohesive policy by leaders and diplomats on both sides of the pond caused a major war in the Pacific.	2004-05-24

The series of post-WWII undeclared wars had culminated in the tar-baby of SE Asia, the body-bags were arriving home by boatloads, thousands of US prisoners were rotting in the tiger-cages of North Vietnam and finally a significant segment of the US public was demanding to know why.<br />Barnet explores the answers in a good, though fairly one-sided exploration of the factors that led us where we were.  In many instances the facts he presents continue to apply in the post-Vietnam Era, though the comparative silence of the guns between Vietnam and the Gulf War would have argued otherwise during those years.  <br />However, after the humiliating memories of Vietnam were washed away in the smoke and blood of the Gulf War and overtly bellicose behavior returned to US foreign policy the questions once again are worthy of answers.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who's confused about the roots of American policy, how we got here, and who's behind the wheel of the decisions of our government about foreign policy.	2004-05-24

Graber	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A memoir	Graber's memories of his times with the Terry Texas Rangers fighting throughout the Civil War are a bit disjointed, but awfully good reading and surprisingly detailed.  The story actually begins with his childhood when his parents both died of typhoid near Houston during the Republic years.  Graber carries the reader through his experiences as a muleteer, a surveyor, a shop clerk and a young entrepreneur before the outbreak of the war.  He and his business partner argue over which has to stay and run the enterprise and which gets to ride off to war.<br />With the Terry Texas Rangers, Graber describes the countless skirmishes, raids, battles and retreats up and down the Shenendoah Valley, Shilo, Perryville and later in Georgia.  His anecdotes are worth the price of admission.  At one point he was riding beside Nathan Forrest during a charge when they both attempted to fire on an enemy position.  Forrest's horse stumbled in front of Graber's and Graber narrowly missed shooting Forrest in the head.  In the memoir Graber observes this would have been a considerable tragedy.<br />He also gives a good portrayal of life inside several Union prisons, where he waited to be hanged as a spy, before taking the identity of one of the countless dead and managing to get himself exchanged.<br />This isn't a scholarly work.  It's the memories of a man who was there, participating in the fights scholars would write about for 150 years or more.  <br />For a first hand look at a piece of the Civil War through the eyes of an enlisted man who fought in it to the end, refused to take the Oath of Allegiance, took the owlhoot trail home and operated under an alias until after reconstruction, I recommend it.	2004-05-20

That's the basic theme of Canticle for Liebowitz.<br />As the churches of past times strove to have their Saints and holy artifacts recognized by the Church, so they do in Canticle.  It's a good yarn, an intertaining one, an absorbing one.  I'm not certain why this book isn't among those listed as 'classics', reviewed by hundreds of reader-fans.

The planet earth has a future that might, or mightn't include a fragile, two-legged creature who thinks he owns it all.  In this book it includes him, but he doesn't own it.  <br />The Long Afternoon of Earth is a lesson in perspective, in humility, in one of the many possible futures of mankind when all the wars have been fought and forgotten, when all the nations and political parties have had their sparks of glory and died.  It's a world of no heroes, no cowards, no real signifance except the same one mankind faced in his deepest history: survival.  There's a touch of wistfulness here, a touch of melancholy.  But it's a good lever to pry your mind away from the mess your dog made on the livingroom floor, the mess your favorite politician made on the floor of your big ideas, the mess your nation made on the face of a planet that goes on and on, where human affairs and the centuries are an insignificant spark.<br />Read it.	2004-05-16

It's only one strategy, and not necessarily the one you'll choose to lead your own life, but it's still worth studying and comprehending.

I'm giving it those stars because I managed to enjoy the book.  Although it doesn't qualify precisely as fictionalized history throughout, it comes close overall and actually is through most of it.  <br />Even for people who consider themselves well schooled in history there's bound to be a lot of minutia that slips by for any piece of geography.  Rutherford fills in the gaps for the Salsbury plains and does it with fact where possible, speculation where not possible.  And he does it with consistent panache.  <br />I'd never given much thought to the details of the building of Salsbury Cathedral, though I certainly was awed, visiting it.  Sarum carried me through generations of that immediate period and place of the building in a way that caused me to inevitably have more respect and thought for the builders.  Similarly for myriad other incidents and monuments of the area over 20,000 years.  Stonehenge, Roman occupation, Viking raids, early Christianity, the bloody reigns of Bloody Mary and others.<br />Make a career of reading this book if need be, but read it.	2004-05-14

They don't require that we believe in them to exist, but if we're able to recognize them for what they are it helps.  Recognizing it doesn't make it easy, but it makes it possible.<br />Peck's premises mightn't be entirely correct, as some suggest.  But whether it's 'evil' or merely something not evil that could get a job being evil if there was such an occupation, Peck's approach works.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who knows, loves, cares about and lives with the agonies of the phenomenon Peck calls 'evil'.	2004-05-14

Books	4	9	10	N	N	The murder of the century everyone forgot	Sir Harry Oakes, his place in the minds of pre-WWII well-to-do, his connections with the rich, powerful and regal, and finally, his spectacular homicide and bumbled investigation all make it a worthwhile area of interesting esoterica.  I don't believe this is the best work ever written about Oakes or his murder(ers), but it's one of the few books about it still available.  It's middling good place to try to read about a fascinating man and an incident that briefly took the attention of the world away from profound events elsewhere.  If you enjoy this and it makes you hungry for more you might try hunting down, The Life and Death of Sir Harry Oakes by Geoffrey Bocca as a captivating follow-up.	2004-05-14

My reason is that I find it difficult to separate the novel from the time I first read it and the kind, helpful man who wrote it.  I read this book during the early 1950s because I admired and respected Jack Williamson as a man and a bit of a mentor for a youngster aspiring to be a writer.<br />During the intervening years I've read the book several times.  Sometimes I've found 'mistakes' in his science distracting.  Other times I've been slightly put off by implications of the plot I missed as a youngster.<br />I believe this book can be read and enjoyed strictly as a novel, as a demonstration of early years of SF, as a fun read to pique the not-too-skeptical imagination.  As an indicator of Williamson's philosophy, of the power of 'dark forces' of the universe, a reader would be looking too far, too deep.  Such thinking would be an anachronism, would have made Jack's life unbearable in the small, evangelical Christian town where we lived.<br />Read this book for fun and enjoy it.	2004-05-14

This movie is one I'd put up beside The Last Picture Show, A Small Town In Texas and a number of other portrayals of small town life in the US circa 1950s.  The difference lies with the Remick/McQueen combo, the harmony, the tension and the incredible intensity of Steve McQueen at his absolute best.  <br />The McQueen character here is a small-town young man from a lousy homelife, grown up, gone to prison for a brief time, poor and trying to make something of his life with his young wife, Lee Remick and their pre-school daughter, Margaret Rose.  McQueen's past plays heavily against him; his hangups, pride, independence and general hard-headedness lead him into troubles with the entire town and the law enforcement community while the endearing Remick and Margaret Rose watch in tender helpless desolation.<br />I don't know why this movie's not on the best-seller list with all the other oldies.  It should be.<br />A blushing afterthought:  Turns out Baby The Rain Must Fall actually is right there where it belongs.  I missed it in my search, found this, wrote the review and here's a picture of me crashing and burning with a review of something I'm not sure what is and not knowing how to erase.

We were going to be living in domed cities, each having his own airplane and living on pills.  Hobo cities in space were far easier to believe, and early SF was about predicting how we'd be living in the future, things that 'might happen'.  But while the Okie Cities concept is no longer valid, SFs changed to accomodate it.  Finally we can just relax and enjoy a great writer and a series of yarns to take you away from the future you're having to live as we never believed it would be.<br />That's what I recommend you do.	2004-05-13

The book hadn't been released when I read The Stars are Ours.  There weren't many SF books on the library shelves in those days, so I returned to recheck the first one and discovered Star Born.  Felt I'd died and went to heaven.<br />I reread both a number of times through the years, always hoping Norton would add a few more sequels, assuming it was an obvious target for a series.  It never happened.  <br />So, you're stuck with these two, which will probably cause you to join me in my wish Norton had written more.	2004-05-13

Painted Bird is about the human condition, set in a time and place where the human condition had the whole spectrum of opportunities to manifest itself.  Kozinski's perceptions of humanity are poignant, surgical, honest and brutal.

I've read them a number of times since and still enjoy them.<br />I really wouldn't call this 'juveniles', though young adults will enjoy them too.

This book travels through China, has great photos of Mao as a young man, compares him with his arch-enemy, Chang, and gives a brief history of pre-WWII China.  Then it moves into the Soviet Union and discusses the War Effort there, Uncle Joe Stalin, Stalingrad, and includes a photograph which (for me) is one of the most ..... poignant of WWII....

It's also nice to find a novel that actually has characters casting yarrow sticks and consulting the I Ching, believing in what the consultations reveal.<br />The War Lord's a good book.

Theodore White was one of my early reads.  Because of the rabid anti-communism of the times I found myself wondering how White managed to keep himself out of the clutches of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, writing such things.

Probably it's best not to wonder.  Steve McQueen made a great hero of the prison camp in the movie, but something was lost.  A young man, an entepreneur, finds his element in a Japanese POW camp in Southeast Asia.  He's a scrounger, a bargainer, a person who can get whatever anyone needs, wants, yearns for.  He charges for it in labor, in goods, in money.  All the other prisoners dispise him for what he's able to do, but use him.  <br />This is a story of the human condition, of human weakness, human flaws and blame.  Read the book, see the movie and allow yourself to feel the tragedy of a man who's doing what he does best, fills a needed function, earns the hatred and scorn of his betters, all in an environment that ends the day the Japanese surrender.	2004-05-11

A Case of Lone Star is the Kinkster's debut into the mystery genre and it's a good one, as they all are. Kinky, his friends and his cat will soon become friends to you, as well.  Once you become hooked on his mysteries I'd suggest you take a peek at his music, too.  Most of it's coming available again in CD, which is a true blessing for those of us who spent our meagre earnings buying albums in vinyl to hear the Kinkster's 1960s-70s literary works in the form of lyrics.<br />Tip your hat to these good mysteries by Kinky, then go and buy some more.

Maybe that's the reason this great work of science fiction lies dormant and almost forgotten.  The book is absorbing, fires the imagination, is both believable and original.  I don't believe, of all the thousands of books of science fiction I've read over half a century, I've ever read one similar to this (and few better).<br />The basic story involves a starship the size of a small city on a voyage lasting hundreds of years.  Many generations prior to the time of this plot a cataclysmic event and internal disruptions caused the crew to break into factions and isolate themselves.  Thereafter the population forgot itself, what it was, and struggled to survive and understand, by the time of this plot, in a strange world.<br />If you'd like to discover a 'new' old one you'll treasure and read many times through your life this is a good shot at finding one, while it can still be obtained.

The fact Golem was a monster, the fact the Jewish community is portrayed as what it probably was, the fact that every element of this story is a tragedy, none of that takes anything away from it for me.  <br />I keep this one on the science fiction shelf of my mind, even though it's more than that, different from most science fiction.  It's historical fiction, it's fantasy, and in a sense it's a study in eastern European and Jewish cultural history.<br />I have no qualms about recommending it despite what others might see as literary flaws.  I've dissected enough good books in university English departments to understand how perfect a work must be to survive the determined perusal by lesser men.	2004-05-08

They usually begin with a desparation by a community, group actions and initial improvements in the situation.  Then they devolve to personal grudges and revenge.  Institutional law establishments are probably preferable, on the whole.<br />The Socorro experience with vigilantes began with homicide between a member of one imbittered ethnic group and a highly thought of member of another.  The law happened to be controlled by same side as the killers.  The result was the formation of a citizens committee, a series of hangings and a somewhat less violent community.  Probably Socorro was one of the more successful attempts of this sort.  They stopped before it got out of control.<br />The writing is less polished than you might hope, but the book is worth reading if you're interested in an in-depth study of the webs a community can weave to ensnare itself in outcomes most people would not choose as an alternative.	2004-05-07

Nevertheless, I agreed, but with the caveat that she mightn't like what I'd have to say about the book. <br />I winced when the volume arrived, mildly chiding myself for agreeing to read it.  I found myself putting it off, but a night or two later I couldn't sleep.  I opened to read a page or two and found when I quit I'd read it all. <br />It's a good book and a perspective in defense of the Ouija Board based on many years of hands-on experience.<br />I don't claim to know about Ouija Boards.  The viewpoints are conflicting and while I'd feel entirely comfortable using one if I felt moved to do so, I've never recommended it to anyone.<br />Virginia has no such qualms.  If you've read the negative reports on this device and want to know the other side, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better place to consider another view than in this book.  <br />The author is as much an authority on the subject as several decades of experience can make a person.

The Navajo campaign of 1864 and old Kit are inseparable from one another, Siamese twins of events and history.  The campaign resulted in defeat and the Trail of Tears for the Din'e people, exile to Bosque Redondo for several years, and a century and a half of bitterness.  Kit Carson led that campaign and he's been vilified by the Navajo from that time to this.<br />Trafzer documents the story of the war as well, probably, as it can be documented.  The facts are susceptible to slanting through emphasis here and failure to emphasize there, but the facts remain.  The same is true of all we know about the mystery man Kit Carson was.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the Navajo wars.  I'd also suggest it as a piece of any study of Kit Carson, who is well worth the study.  A hero, a coward, a man of wisdom and noteworthy education who could not write his own name.	2004-05-04

That just says it all.  You don't need to think you enjoy poetry to treasure this book.  Tagore captures moment after moment of the human experience, pierces each with an insight of his own and shares it with the reader.  In a sense it bears a similarity to those little books of daily prayers or 'thoughts for the day' people used to hand you when they came to the door uninvited to explain to you what you should believe to mold yourself to a nearer model of what they, themselves believed.

He soaks in to your conciousness the way water enters a sponge, and he stays there.<br />I think a copy of this book ought to be by the bedside in every home in America to be read during those times when the weight of our submersion in this reality seems too heavy to bear, or when the joys lift us too high.	2004-05-04

But real life, it was, and The Adventurer will make it real for you.  It's a fast-paced, action packed story that will throw the reader off-balance and keep him there, start to finish.	2004-05-04

My review of that book is lengthy and every word of it applies to this one as well.<br />****************************************<br />The Cozzens experience describes an ancient land during the final years before discoveries of gold, Apache wars, the Civil War and a focus of interest from California and the east changed it forever.  He visited Zuni, Acoma, Laguna, Mesilla, Tucson and Sacaton and describes them as they'd never be seen again.  He saw the Zuni Mountains as an old-growth forest.  He met and stayed spent a long while in the Apache camp of Cochise, where he had dealings with Mangas Colorado.<br />********************************************************<br />I love reading Cozzens because I love history and I love the southwest.

Compton's account is worth reading more than once, not because of the plotting, characterization and drama, but because the Salt War was one of those pieces of history that illustrates and embodies the real spirit of the American west:  Land grabs and devil-take-the-hindmost.  It's also a demonstration of the kinds of cultural clashes between post-Civil War Anglos and Mexican Americans over traditional rights sanctified by time and land-deeds after US Annexation.

The ranchers, as it happened, were figures in the Lost Adams Diggings legend:  John Brewer, A.J. Tenney, James Street and James Gray.  <br />Brewer's account of the Adams story wasn't made public until 1928 El Paso Herald published the story, but if his account was true the Adams placer location was in New Mexico, somewhere between Magdalena and Springerville, AZ.  <br />However, Adams aside, the Mormon connection with the Adams had never before been revealed anywhere in the Adams search community prior to the 1990s, though it had been in print many years. An accidental discovery of the book in the 1990s changed all that. Without Nino, Brewer could be ignored as an anomaly.<BR>An anathema for those dedicated to specific locations outside Brewer's escape route to the Rio Grande suddenly this obscure Apache was worth vilifying.<BR>  <BR>Later research has confirmed Nino's claims through primary documentation, birth records and other sources.<br />Nino certainly told the truth about many matters he had no reason to lie about.  Whether he lied about other issues is a matter of pure conjecture.  The Nino book is worth reading, whether you're interested in Apache lore, or the Lost Adams Diggings.	2004-04-24

Maybe that's the reason memories of the trek have faded into obscurity.  Kendall's narrative of the planning of the Expedition, the gathering at Kinney Fort and the trek northward and westward were all invaluable as a reference tool when I was writing Hell Bent For Santa Fe.  I'd imagine Larry McM also used it when he was writing Dead Man's Walk, about the march of the captives south to Mexico after the surrender.  If you are a casual reader or a historian you'll probably want to own this tome.  In my own researches through the Texas Archives and the various libraries and surviving diaries I almost always referred back to the Kendall book to see what he was doing at the time.<br />In addition to the value as a research tool, this is a great read.  Kendall's writing style converts historical events, misery, turmoil, mutiny, Indian fights and hunger in a way seldom found in non-fiction.  You'll read this book more than once.	2004-04-18

I expected to be sated on the genre before I finished the reading the first one (Ragged Man).  Horror isn't my long suit, or so I thought.<br />Therefore, I was surprised to find myself a bit sorry when I finished Ragged Man.  I immediately began Gecko and stayed up later than my usual pumpkin hour finishing it, enjoying every page.<br />Gecko is an imaginative, fast-paced combo of sinister supernatural beings, human crime and adventure.  The characters are handled well, the monsters are entertaining and the plot is tightly woven.  Jack Priest scored another home run with Gecko.<br />My suspicion is you'll buy another Jack Priest book if you read this one.	2004-01-09

Many of the characters are the same as those found in the novel, but any expectation that the facts are less bizarre than fiction will meet with disappointment.  <br />Friday, October 13, 1307, Phillip IV of France ordered the immediate and surprise arrest of all the Knights Templar in France.  His captive Pope, Clement V, subsequently excommunicated them all and dissolved the order.  The Grand Master, Jacques de Molay, was roasted alive over a slow fire by the Inquisition.  The last Crusade was over, the Holy Land was lost and the Templars, the best fighting force in Post-Crusades Europe were no longer needed.  An international Order of warrior monks, the Templars were too powerful, too wealthy and too unpredictable in their future allegiances for Phillip to tolerate.<br />Evidently, the French contingent of the Knights Templar was forewarned.  Most escaped France to places unknown on 18 sailing vessels, carrying with them the vast Templar treasure.  Leigh and Baigent surmise through exhaustive research that the Templar destination was Scotland, where they secretly carried the order through several violent centuries of intrigue.  The authors argue convincingly that Templar intervention was responsible for the victory by Robert Bruce over English forces at Bannockburn on June 24, 1314.  Their descendants gradually evolved, these authors suggest, the organization that became Freemasonry.<br />March 20, 1737, Andrew Michael Ramsey, member of the English Royal Society, Rosicrucian and Freemason, delivered a public address (concerning Freemasons and Templars) in France, which stated, in part, \\"This sacred promise was therefore not an execrable oath, as it has been called, but a respectable bond to unite Christians of all nationalities in one cofraternity.\\"<br />Police in Holland and Sweden had already acted against Freemasons.  Within a few days of Ramsey's oration the French police followed suit.  April 24, 1738, Pope Clement XII issued a Papal Bull \\"En enimenti apostolatus specula', forbidding all Catholics to become Freemasons under threat of excommunication.  Two years later, in the Papal States, membership in a lodge was punishable by death.<br />The long, winding trail through the centuries with these authors in the facts leading monarchs and church authorities to damn members of the organization to which such notables as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Sam Houston and countless others is well worth the reading. Baigent and Leigh have done a great job of research and writing.	2004-01-09

I enjoyed reading all three, but I considered Night Witch the best in plot, character development and pure imagination.<br />Supernatural creatures of the Jack Priest universe aren't contained by the fences of traditional boundaries.  They slip through and explode into new and unexpected avenues of the mind, the dark closet and the sounds just outside the bedroom window.  Priest combines human thriller-drama with hand grenades of outrageous (but almost believable) nightmare creatures in a way that will keep you reading until you finish (even if you have to get up early in the morning and really need to put this down and get some shuteye).  <br />Night Witch is Priest's best to date.

I'd only read one book in the genre, one by Stephen What'sHisName.  So I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Jack Priest books are fun, well-written, tightly plotted and entertaining.  <br />Ragged Man begins in the Australian desert and bounces around the globe, finding metaphysical beasties, real-time music black-marketers and investigators gone postal.  Priest does a great job of weaving his great-big-ugly-thingamajig into a volatile human setting.  There's something here for everyone.  Readers knowledgeable about metaphysical pursuits will find aspects of the plot and characters to be uncomfortably close to certain other realities, getting the juices flowing in ways they didn't anticipate.  Young readers will enjoy the book for the adrenalin rushes.<br />I don't believe you'll regret buying this book, even if you think you don't like horror genre.	2003-12-30

By doing so he missed seeing so many of his perceptions of humanity and social conditions in the US carried to their ultimate logical extreme.  Toole was obviously an observant young writer, able to voice opinion well without communicating the underlying bitterness one would expect of a person on the brink of self-homicide.<br />Perhaps Toole intended the characters to be caricatures.  If so, he failed.  The characters are merely the (not particularly) extremes found in the population pool of the 20th Century US, created and presented to the reader within a plot probably believed to be humorous.  Readers might find the humor an uncomfortably realistic portrayal of human flaws.<br />The book is certainly well written.  It's an interesting read with excellent characterization, plot, and setting.  It's also a book I didn't enjoy reading.  Toole's astute awareness of human motivation, stupidity and the direction society was headed was, for me, overshadowed by the fact of his suicide.  <br />Toole guessed right about the direction and perceived correctly about many facets of the human condition, then deliberately curtailed his own experience of that life.  Reading the book without that knowledge would have made it enjoyable and had me laughing through every page.	2003-12-15

All the various soon-to-be-dead Kennedys were alive, Communism as an ideal was still arguable (though lousily manifested in the USSR and PRC) and Martin Luther King was unknown, both for his 'dream', and for his purloined doctoral dissertation.  The value of Christianity was still up for grabs in most of our young minds.  An effective Village pickup line was a sneering, \\"What?  You don't believe in Free Love?\\"  In that hallowed atmosphere we discussed Camus, Sartre and Existentialism.  We generally missed the point.<br />Nevermind Existentialism.  The Plague is a good book.  A great book about humans, stress, isolation and the human condition.  A French seaport town stricken by plague finds itself isolated and dying for most of a year.  The narrators watch the developments and phases of the epidemic within individuals, the government and the stricken.  After a recent re-reading of this book I wonder why we never simply appreciated it for what it is, instead of using The Plague as one of the several platforms for debate in the battles with and for our spiritual selves.  I wonder why we refused to see the virtue of the book without forcing it to be something less obvious than it is.<br />I recommend this book for anyone.  I suspect it can't be read from any level without appreciation.	2003-12-15

I spent more time on it than I probably should have, because the book was the winner of the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award for Emerging Writers (whatever that is).  In the end, I was forced to conclude that the New York University Press published the work because it hints at feminism, has almost no plot, hints at sympathy for oppressed peoples, describes HIV in some parts of Africa and has many other traits post-Modern English departments of higher education insist have value for budding English scholars.  As a reader with a degree in English Literature from a public New York University, I tip my hat to the sentiments.  As a reader who prefers books with plot, characterization, some form of interest beyond the inane observations of the author and barely hidden shouts of `I have experience and saw stuff like this', I repudiate it.<br />On the other hand, I suspect feminists and the minions of social justice might love it.  I recommend it without reservation for those.	2003-12-15

Angelic, long suffering mothers of 19th Century literature were unveiled so often by so many writers as to always be tripwire for suspicion by readers.  The more angelic a woman is portrayed, the more devious and profound the flaws before the final chapter.  So it is with Coming of Rain.<br />A young man, dominated by a strong mother wielding the romantic Old South and a barely remembered Confederate father, discovers the past as it really was.  He also discovers himself as he must be in the future.  The Coming of Rain is a flood of story beginning in drought, of a prediction by a madman about to be hanged, of many kinds of slavery of the mind long after the ownership of other humans was abolished.<br />This book isn't heavy reading, but it's enjoyable for those who like historical fiction.	2003-12-12

Hidden behind all the white noise of two World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Communism, assassinations, genocides, computers, automobiles, television, telephones and airplanes is a political reality.  US self-definition of the 20th Century was personified by Theodore Roosevelt and almost no other public figure.  His popularity, honesty, stoicism and ideals, all the best of the way Americans wished to view themselves, allowed the ghost of his kinsman, Franklin Delano to point US political direction for the remainder of the Century.<br />Theodore was the son of a wealthy New York elite who paid a substitute to serve in his place on the battlefields of the Civil War and the slave owning Southern Belle who was probably the model for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind.  While his mother and grandmother were sending packages to the South via blockade-runners and most of his kinsmen South of the Mason-Dixon Line were dying in battle, the tyke Teddy expressed the wish that all `rebel soldiers would be ground to powder'.  He idolized his father throughout his life, but barely mentioned his mother in his autobiography.   <br />Recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, hero of San Juan Hill, Trust-Buster, cowboy, rancher, and founder of the earliest National Parks, National Wilderness Areas, and National Forests, Roosevelt was largely responsible for the 20th Century love affair with the West.  Hoot Gibson, Tom Mix, Gene Autry, John Wayne and Roy Rogers would have all lived different lives if Teddy Roosevelt had followed the footprints of his father (and there'd be no `Teddy Bear').  So would we all live in an entirely different America.<br />David McCullough gives us a great account of this man of contrasts and his family.  I recommend it as the best work ever compiled on a man who might one day behailed as the `best' president America ever had.  McCullough gives us a human Roosevelt who carried all the best attributes of the 19th Century into the present.	2003-12-12

Books	4	1	1	N	N	And no trouble at all except to put down before you finish	If the Marx brothers could have teamed up with the Keystone Cops in a 21st Century cops and robbers episode in print they might have picked Big Trouble as a nice fit.  Puggy, a benign version of the modern `street person' phenomenon, drifts to Miami to find himself at home living in a tree over the fence separating the family a wealthy low-level gangster from the world of consequences.  He stumbles into a job in a run-down bar owned by two ex-Russian gunrunners dealing in stolen Soviet arms, and so begins one of the funnier dead-serious books I've read this century.  A kid in a squirt-gun assassin game tangled into the activities of real-live hit-men, a man-woman Miami's finest cop team tightroping it between battles of the sexes and societal chaos all combine to make this a readable, laughable, believable book you might even put aside to read again a year from now..	2003-12-07

Although the title is several years out of date in some areas, it's still the best document of the kind I've ever seen for the State of New Mexico in a broad-brush quick reference or for an in-depth study of certain aspects of New Mexico history you won't find elsewhere.  I'd love to see UNM Press do another run of this one or print it on a book by book POD.  It's entirely too good to allow to become unavailable.	2003-12-05

His plots are generally captivating, his characters, believable, funny and unusual.  The comparisons by some reviewers to Huck Finn and his friends are probably valid on some level.  Journey to Matecumbe begins on the Mississippi River, involves a raft trip downstream to escape the KKK, and includes a number of amusing, colorful characters involved in unlikely situations.  It's worth the price of admission, if only for an interesting read.<br />However, readers who wish to get some historical knowledge with their enjoyment will find the obscure, post-Civil War era Florida Keys portions also to their liking.  Taylor obliges the historical fiction reader by also taking some of the characters through Seminole villages, swamps, and a trek along the land route from the Florida panhandle to Miami.  The descriptions of the earliest origins of the KKK might also be accurate.<br />I'd recommend this book as a better than average historical fiction to rest on the bookshelf for a later re-reading.	2003-12-03

The book isn't masterly and the plot probably isn't as tightly woven as it might be.  But the characters are believable, the setting, almost bizarre enough to have come out of Wentworth, Ohio, by a popular horror writer, minus all the occult and parapsychology.  <br />An ingrown neighborhood in Fort Worth, Texas, full of personal histories and human flaws reaches a series of climaxes (no pun intended) during a period of a few hours and in the end the reader is left with a handful of seeds for his own imagination to sprout and blossom.  Readers familiar with Guy Clark might hear the lyrics of `Boats to Build' repeating themselves through some of the episodes.  The coincidence of similarity might suggest Coomer is a Guy Clark aficionado, or that Guy found the story an inspiration for his song.  Either way, the two make a matched set.<br />Coomer owes no apologies to dogs or readers for this one.	2003-12-03
US	26915713	REB0YWLNP6QL7	0553052314	253529750	Bloody Season	Books	5	9	13	N	N	Clear distinctions	Of the hundreds of books written about Tombstone and the Arizona Territory during the times of the Clanton and Earps I'd give this one the highest marks.  Although it's a fictionalized history, Estleman manages to capture several traits concerning the period I've never seen in non-fiction.<br />No US Territory during the 19th Century was exactly the shiny ideal we're tempted to assign to America. While the Tombstone marshals Earp faction were battling the Presidential appointed Territorial Governor appointed Sheriff Behan/Clanton faction in Territorial Arizona over who could seize power, steal the most cattle, rob the most stage-coaches loaded with silver from the nearby mines, similar events were happening in New Mexico and other Territories.  Estleman re-creates the nature of this politically motivated war for raw power descended directly from Washington DC as few writers have managed to do.  The author is also careful to explain to his readers where he's deviated from documented fact, such as in the details of conversations between the parties.<br />Estleman also avoids the pitfalls of so many writers by seeing a clear distinction between courage and heroism.  Men willing to enthusiastically face other armed men in gun battles from a distance of a few feet are certainly in possession of fearlessness, or courage.  In Tombstone, Arizona, such fearlessness was rife on both sides of the local war.  The author succeeds in communicating the fact that such profound courage doesn't necessarily accompany virtue of any other sort.  Tombstone was a war between brave men of ambition.  The ground they fought for was profit and naked power.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br />I'm giving this book five stars because of the eggs it breaks.	2003-11-25
US	26915713	RNIARSGRZACTA	042507787X	473469987	Trinity's Child	Books	3	13	14	N	N	An unlikely scenario	Apocalypse books from the Cold War years should probably constitute a genre.  The well written ones such as Dr.Strangelove, et al embody a reality of the 20th Century no less real because we didn't manage to inflict it upon ourselves.  Although the books of this genre represent an anachronism, they don't forfeit their claim to a place on the bookshelf.<br />Trinity's Child is a relative latecomer in this regard. The scenario was a bit hackneyed by the time Prochnau wrote the yarn, but it serves as a time capsule to the almost forgotten fears of the early 1980s when a segment of the US population believed the military buildup of the Reagan years might drive the USSR to indulge in a preemptive nuclear strike.  Many authors during those years chose to transmit their concerns to the public by writing plots involving alternatives to MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).<br />In Trinity's Child the Soviets choose the unlikely method of a limited nuclear strike against military targets in the US. This attempt to de-escalate the Cold War is accompanied by a message to the President of the US from the Soviet Premier.  The Premier explains the motives and offers to accept a similar launch from the US without retaliating.  The book is a classic demonstration of how far-fetched the workings of the human mind can wander while motivated by fear.  <br />The Soviet plan soon runs awry when a misguided missile finds its way into the Washington suburbs.  Prochnau follows the members of a B-52 crew from Cheyenne Mountain along their route, the presidential succession process through the ranks of politicos down to the Secretary of the Environment and the Strategic Air Command when it loses command and control as a result of magnetic pulses.<br />The book is an interesting read.  The wild-eyed scenario is subdued by the knowledge that all this didn't happen, allowing readers to enjoy the aspersions cast on politicians and the interactions of a bomber crew torn by personal loss and self-doubt.<br />I'd give this one a recommendation limited to readers who've enjoyed similar books	2003-11-24

The book convinced me I shouldn't have been so thorough in my rejection of this author.<br />The storyline spans the time when Bach was still barnstorming in his biplane, through his discovery that his books were selling well, the subsequent difficulties with the IRS and a few years into his marriage.  It's a carefully woven tale of human growth, values, relationships, goals and metaphysical experience.  Bach's unblushing descriptions of the role of metaphysics in his life served as a source of surprise and respect for me throughout the book.  His OBEs will appeal to those who've had them, as well as those interested in pursuing that facet of the human psyche/soul.  Readers will probably forgive the author his attempts to draw meaning from it all and state his conclusions as fact.  Bach isn't alone in this tendency.  Robert Monroe, scientist and granddaddy-long-legs of 20th Century OBE writings made a second career of the same occupation.<br />Pilots will love this tale for a different reason.  We're always hungry to hear someone else describe the magic of being airborne.  I'd place Bach on the bookshelf alongside Ernest Gann in that respect.  <br />For most people the most important aspect of The Bridge Across Forever probably involves relationships.  The last half of the 20th Century uprooted 10,000 years of traditional roles between men and women and offered no replacement.  The self-searching and growth Bach experienced during the years spanned by this book will find a resonance with a vast readership of both sexes.<br />I'll be reading a lot more of Richard Bach.  I have no pangs of conscience in recommending The Bridge Across Forever to anyone looking for a good read with surprising substance.	2003-11-24

I don't know that the inspiration comes from the Foster handling of the subject matter so much as the amusingly human David-Neal phenomenon.  Ms. David-Neal pursued the life she wanted to pursue against all odds in a time and place where it had no business happening.  <br />Her grit and determination, on the one hand, and her unapologetic disingenuousness in the methods used to follow her chosen course are a striking contrast to the evidently superficial Buddhist path she followed.  Time after time in the book the reader will shake his head in wonderment as he reads her letters cajoling her husband for more money, while explaining she'll be ready to come home in 'just a little more time'.  A 19th Century European woman wintering alone with her servants year after year above 13000 feet in the Himalayans.<br />If this book doesn't inspire readers to accept the reality that anyone can do and be anything he wishes in this life, probably nothing will do so.	2003-11-16

Readers who wish to pursue Reiki by the traditional approach will probably find no better book than this one for doing so.  A Reiki Master will ultimately be required for the attunement, however, and because of the various training / attunement structures built into the programs of many Reiki Masters the book might only be a supplement to another training program.  On the other hand, anyone wishing to pursue Reiki can do no wrong by following the traditional approach through a manual such as this one, then finding a non-Traditional Reiki Master to do the attunements and thereby save considerable time and money.<br />I'd recommend this book as one of several for anyone beginning a Reiki training program.	2003-11-09

As a means of understanding ancient rock art in North America the book probably occupies an unchallenged place on the bookshelf of anyone interested in these 'artifacts'.  Unfortunately, as a field guide the book has some serious organizational snags.  The specific types of subject matter are arranged in ways to cause a person in a field setting to create some rock-art of his own with his fingernails.  Even though my copy of this book is tattered through long use I continue to have difficulties relocating what I'm searching for in the text.  I usually carry a simpler and better organized field guide for quick and dirty work and leave the Patterson book for a time when I'm sitting on a rock somewhere catching my breath after the fact.<br />All this said, I believe this book is a great one and I'd recommend it for home study.

The Stonehenge object demands this sort of wonder.  <br />The humans who looked and wondered encompassed every phase of human history from the stone/early-bronze age until today.  They built legends and myths about the builders based upon themselves, their own abilities as societies and their assumptions about the men who preceded them.  Those who couldn't conceive of a technology capable of moving 50 ton boulders from many miles away explained what they saw with Gods and magic.  Those who lived in the bloody ages of warfare and vain royalties explained what they saw in those terms.  Always they assumed the men of the past were at least as ignorant and savage as themselves.<br />The men who built Stonehenge during the centuries between 1750 and 1500 BC might have been bloody.  But they were not ignorant.  The subsequent centuries of men could never conceive of the purpose of Stonehenge until computers were invented.  Stonehenge is, itself, a massive computer.  Hawkins, an astronomer at the dawn of the recent computer age, applied an IBM computer and finally solved the mystery of purpose in the huge stones in 1963.<br />The monument required millions of man-hours to build and an understanding of astronomy not repeated for tens of centuries.  At least a major part of the Stonehenge purpose involved predicting celestial events on a scale almost as grandiose as Stonehenge itself.<br />Hawkins wrote this book four decades ago.  Until his discoveries and publication hundreds of theories surrounded the monument.  Today, because of Hawkins, any conflicting new theory on any aspect of Stonehenge has to be weighed against his findings and proven.  This is the Hawkins accomplishment.  Men finally have a clearer view, not only of the massive stones, but of the complex intellects and shocking accomplishments of stone age and bronze age man.  Stonehenge finally demonstratesthe intellect of the creators more than the unbelievable technological project of itself those later men could always see.  <br />This book is a must read.	2003-11-01

The book was drawing dust on my bookshelf and I was hard up for reading material so I thought it might be worth a read.  It passed the time for an evening.<br />I've never read any Stephen King novels so I don't know how it compares with the others.  All I can say is the book is relatively fast moving in most parts.  I'm not certain it qualifies as a thriller.  The reader's not required to suspend disbelief too often during most of the book.<br />A number of distracting insertions within the text, correspondence only peripheral to the plot, but intended to explain away holes were one of the two things I found distracting and easy to skip over after the first few.  Those probably removed an hour or more of reading (but speeded the plot).<br />The other item I found unforgiveable in a seasoned writer.  The descriptions of handguns and projectiles by characters claiming to know what they are talking about reveal an ignorance on the subject by the author.  At one point a character (while claiming to know about such matters) examines a spent projectile and explains to the others that there's no mark on the base from the 'firing pin of the gun that fired it'.  I don't hold not knowing about firearms against a writer unless he insists on explaining them.  I hope Kings techniques in his writing have improved since he wrote this one.  <br />Otherwise the story flows well and if you jump past all the unnecessary digressions it's a pleasurable enough distraction.	2003-10-28

I've read the Hornblower series so many times I've worn out a set or two, loaning them to friends and acquaintances.  But I don't pretend the Hornblower series is anything more than a fun, interesting journey through the life of an imaginary man.<br />The Sky and the Forest is another matter.  Forester sets the novel deep in Africa at that crucial moment in history when the stone age metamorphosed overnight.  This is no smileybook fantasy about the noble savage raped by intrusions of civilization.  Forester's character is a human being living as humans lived in primitive environments and chronicals crucial, devastating events that change those lives when one culture succumbs to another.   Forester might have chosen pre-Columbian America, pre-Coronadoan New Mexico, pre-Pizzaroan Peru, pre-Roman England or Gaul, or any of a thousand other places and times.  <br />This is a timeless novel about the human condition and shared human flaws by an author capable of doing them justice.

Instead, I'll suggest another reason a segment of readers might find Rabelais interesting.  Followers of the Thelemic 'traditon' created by Aleister Crowley during the early 1900s might be surprised to discover Crowley's claims to having channeled the doctrine from Horus in Cairo in 1910, were preceded by Rabelais several centuries earlier.

The Strugatsky brothers wrote fiction with a slant readers won't find in any western works in the genre.  Roadside Picnic is one of the most imaginative.  A brief visitation to our planet from some unknown place by unknown beings for reasons incomprehensible.  Six locations on the face of the globe, positioned as though someone fired a pistol at it from space as it turned, are permanently changed, studied and fought over by humans.  The storyline involves a 'stalker', a young man who was a child in one of the areas at the time of the visitation, who then spends the remainder of his life sneaking past guards and barriers risking his life in bizarre expeditions to remove and blackmarket artifacts.  His trails into the hometown of his birth are marked by piles of clothing of other less-fortunate stalkers, guideposts of danger spots. The activities then lead him into prison sentences and an alienation from the bulk of humanity that only the Strugatsky brothers might visualize.  <br />If you love good science fiction you'll love this book.  If you don't love science fiction you'll still love it.  You'll probably also form a desire to read their other contributions.  If so, you are in for a difficult pursuit.

This book was the last of his works I've read, but I re-read it recently and enjoyed it as much as I did when I read it in 1998.  Once during the 1980s Bob cautioned me over lunch that he was prone to untruths.  He warned me about it obliquely again later when he was writing Keepers: A Memoir.  There aren't many people left around these days who know, or are willing to admit the truth and the implicatons of his confession.  Certainly his loyal friend of a lifetime who did another review here knows.  I'm warmed to know Bob has such a friend.<BR>Keepers is a good book.  It's well written and it's a good piece of fiction.  The fact it is not truly a memoir is probably fortunate.  It's better that his son wasn't really killed in life as Bob described in his book.  Better for Bob and his son.  It's better that his step-sister didn't really live in a boxcar as he described in the book. It's better that he didn't have to assist the suicide of Marie, his mom, as he describes here.  The book is a great collection of events that Bob and the people associated with his past can be awfully happy didn't happen. <BR>The fact is Bob writes good fiction, just as he tells good fiction in life.  Bob was born with a talent for fiction.  He's never really mastered truth, but fiction has served him well.  Some of the other reviewers have described him as an artist.  In fact he is.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read.  It is that.	2003-10-09

Probably he wished it so badly he was blinded to the facts.  Comparisons between the Ridley work and the earlier one are probably needless.  The French invasion of Mexico in the 1860s is such an obscure piece of historical knowledge for most outside Mexico as to render the point moot.  A new work every few years to remind a few readers is most likely a positive development.  With each reiteration of the tale a few more Americans might have a dawn of awakening that, while North and South filled the gutters with blood inside the US boundaries the world continued to turn elsewhere.<br />Comprehensive histories of Mexico from 1800 to 1870 are rare.  Most US citizens only know about the Texas War of Independence.  Few even know about the events in the adjacent province, New Mexico,  during those violent years.<br />The Ridley work covers a lot of ground.  The details of what Napoleon III intended, why Britain became involved, and why Ferdinand Max persuaded himself Mexico needed and wanted him are generally made plain in this book.  Politics in the US and the Civil War made this a saga to be watched only out of the corner of the eye while a major European power invaded a neighbor and installed an emperor.  The book is also a middling introduction for the casual reader to become familiar with the first popular leader in Mexican history, Benito Juarez.<br />I consider it a good read and a worthy addition to my bookshelf.	2003-10-01

Auchincloss captures their views of themselves more realistically than a lot of writers probably have done.  That, if no other reason, probably makes this book a worthy expenditure of time.<BR>However, Embezzler is also a study in the tension between honor of the old-time variety, loyalty, and gratitude (or the lack of those).<br />Prime, member of a poor-relations line of wealth meets Rex Geer, a minister's son with a promising future, struggling through Harvard early in the century.  Geer is on the brink of needing to drop out of school.  Prime, before they become friends, sympathizes enough to visit a key authority and arrange for Geer to continue his education.  He brings Geer to his home many times for summer stays, to the dismay of his family and societal equals, introducing him to the people who eventually give Geer the openings necessary to his future.<br />Late in his life and many years after his Wall Street disgrace and prison, Prime observes, \\"today I'd be snubbed by Rex Geer who'd probably be a haberdasher in Jersey City if it weren't for me\\".<br />Thanks to interventions in his life by Prime and thanks also to Geer's own talent and initiative, Geer becomes one of the most financially powerful men of the time.<br />Midway through the depression and at the peak of his career Prime secures loans against his sinking fortunes, using a foundation's resources he's responsible for illegally to stay afloat.  As the stocks creep further downward he finds himself on the brink of discovery.  He goes to Geer (who's meanwhile having a long-term affair with Prime's wife)in hopes of a loan. Geer refuses in the name of honor and justice, leaving his former friend ruined, imprisoned, shunned by his class.  Geer's testimony becomes a factor in Prime's conviction and imprisonment.<br />The book is a great illustration of human perspective and frailty, the story told from the three key viewpoints of Prime, Geer, and Prime's wife.  The spoiled playboy old-family Prime, flawed in many ways, understands compassion and honor at a personal level and lives by it.  Geer, of poor-class antecedents understands honor societally and legally and shows little grasp of those other qualities in his behavior.<br />This book has been out of print for a long while, but I recommend it.	2003-09-25

I had no idea he was on NPR.  When my neighbor loaned me Horseshoes, Cowsocks and Duckfeet I was a long time getting around to picking it up.  When I did it was only because I knew I needed to be able to tell the neighbor I had done so (out of courtesy).<BR>I'm glad I did read it.  Black probably isn't for everyone.  There's a body of experience required to understand the point of his anecdotes and laugh at his humor.  If you are person who's been around farm animals and live in a rural environment you'll probably love this book.  I did.<BR>On the other hand, if you an urbanite and have never been anything else you'll most likely consider it a waste.<BR>The humor is dry and the anecdotes have an 'insider' quality probably unintended by the writer.  The cultural abyss between urbanites and rurals grows ever wider.  If this book doesn't span the gap there are still enough people with rural experience to appreciate and enjoy it.	2003-09-25

Wilson has done a thorough job of researching elusive historical material and solved, at least to my satisfaction, a homicide of 1878. <BR>Swilling was a man who lived by violence in a place where violence was required.  He was, himself, a killer many times over.  When he first left his home he probably killed his first man in an incident of having a dog sicced on to him, which he gutted before the disappointed eyes of the owner.  When the owner attempted the task his canine had just failed to perform, Swilling killed him, too.<BR>After the Mexican War Swilling went to Arizona and encountered his famous long-time friend, Jacob Snively.  Snively was the discoverer of gold at Gila City, Former Paymaster General of the Republic of Texas Army, and various other acts of courage and derring-do when the two men met.<BR>In 1860, when Snively journeyed east to discover gold at Pinos Altos, Swilling was at his side.  In 1862 Swilling led Confederate troops in the only Civil War battle fought west of the Continental Divide.  In 1863, he lured Mimbres Apache Chief Mangas Colorado into capture at Pinos Altos, where Mangas was murdered by US troops while trying to escape.  Mangas was tied to a wagon wheel and burned with incandendescent bayonets by his guards to help him decide to raise himself on an elbow to protest.  <BR>Later, Swilling was with the Woolsey party when, surrounded by Apache they poisoned pinole with strychnine and packed it onto a burro, 'accidently' allowing the animal to escape.  The following morning they were surrounded by dead Apaches.<BR>In 1871 Snively was killed by Apaches at Vulture Gulch.  A few days later Swilling found and buried him on the spot, mutilated, swollen, and partially eaten by coyotes.<BR>Eight years later Swilling exhumed the body of Snively, beginning his own end.<BR>This book is a worthy read.  It thoroughly explores the issues of frontier justice at its worst, but does a fine jobof showing the character of one of the strangest men in Arizona history.<br />All in all, I like Jack Swilling so well I made him one of my main characters in Hell Bent for Santa Fe.  He found his own way into The Lost Adams Diggings - Myth, Mystery and Madness through his Pinos Altos exploits and his connection with Jacob Snively.	2003-09-23

Nino Cochise gave names, rough dates and places of people and events that have only come to light during the past decade, thanks to the myriad geneology resources.<BR>1)  Nino knew about the Mormon adventures in Mexico at a time when no one else was paying any attention at all.<BR>2)  Nino knew John Brewer and Ammon Tenney were Mormons and in Mexico during that time.  Those names were crucial to the Lost Adams Diggings legend, but the Mormon connection had gone unnoticed and would have remained unnoticed had it not been for this obscure tome by Nino Cochise.<BR>3)  Brewer and Tenney both fathered children in Mexico.  How could a fake Nino have even known they'd been there?<BR>4)  Nino told of a gold mine named 'Sno-ta-hay'.  That's the Apache name of the gold mine in the Lost Adams story.  Nino said the name had a meaning.  Until Nino's book no one had any idea what the word meant.  The word described the nature of the placer.  There's no reason to suspect Nino ever heard of the Lost Adams Diggings.<br />And much more, with new evidence emerging every day.<br />Those who call this book a fake probably do so because of their partisanship in the location of the Lost Adams Diggings location.  Nino's book, because it verifies the Brewer/Tenney connection, destroys a lot of pet theories.  However, it's difficult to imagine anyone who takes the trouble to research the Nino story and the multitude of verifiable facts making any assertion of the sort.	2003-09-22

This is the first of the Salinas trilogy, and by some tastes, the funniest.  Steinbeck captures a side of poverty to cause belly-laughs from the reader while never losing sight of the underlying environment of stark contrast from the 20th Century middle-class life experience of most of his readers.  The author also manages to portray a type of machismo existing in a particular facet of some male Hispanics in an atmosphere both sympathetic and realistic.  The characters of Tortilla Flat are the men the evening news of 2003 and the obituaries involving barroom stabbings comprise.  Steinbeck illustrates a side of these characters most of affluent America humanity never sees and he does it without prejudice.  I consider the Salinas trilogy to be the best of Steinbeck's otherwise valuable lifetime of contributions to American literature.	2003-09-20

I loved it as a young person, care nothing for it as an older one.  I was disappointed to discover that fact.  As a Steinbeck lover I'm tempted to believe Winter of our Discontent was a book written at a time when the writer was in a state of abject depression.  The book lacks the usual penetrating characterization, the solid plotting and the rapier wit found in his best works.<br /><br />Here, Steinbeck's character, an old 'founders' family descendant, finds himself in a moral turmoil.  He struggles and comes up lacking in his own eyes.  The struggle then evolves with a different type of challenge:  to continue to live, or to choose death as an alternative to imperfection, of being a flawed human being.	2003-09-19

Unfortunately Feldman placed the book into a mooshy catagory between the two.  If a reader wants an interesting read this is one.  If a reader wants to know facts about the Lost Adams Diggings the goal is more likely to be achieved by reading  Four Days From Fort Wingate by Richard French.<br />Feldman's shakey premise that the Adams Diggings is where he says (and that it's been found) is based on an even shakier bibliography taken mostly out of Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver by Frank Dobie, then misquoted.  The fact that he's presented it somewhat as fact by giving a bibliography distracts somewhat from what would otherwise be a pleasant and interesting read.  If you find yourself tempted to believe anything in this book check the footnote references he uses to support his premises and follow them back to the original document text.  The Feldman book is historical fiction.  Nothing more or less.	2003-09-18

It began the way a man might commence his descent down a winter hillside when he loses his footing.  The ending came with Mahatma Ghandi and Indian independence after WWII.  The Sepoy Mutiny came as a point delineating two facets of that experience.  Prior to the mutiny John Company (The East India Company) enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the British Army.  The mutiny dramatised the serious need to make some major changes in the administration.  Queen Victoria took control of India as ruler.  Thus began the Raj.<br />This fine work follows the Raj from beginning until the end.  The British administration of the Far East didn't get a lot easier when John Company lost power.  The saga is a long one and a necessary one for the historian who simply loves historic enigma.  Creation of the Raj shares a similarity to the US from Reconstruction onward in an obscure way.  I recommend this book for the reader who enjoys the futile attempt to understand the threads of the human experience.	2003-09-18

Duplicates of each... one in the house for planning and study, one in the truck. Occasionally I rotate them so they don't wear out too quickly.  I've given the Delormes top billing in my Desert Emergency Survival Manual, but you don't need desert and you don't need an emergency to need the Delorme Atlas for whereever you are going in a rural area.<br />If you spend a lot of time in the back country these maps are the best alternative, from my point of view. It's true the maps don't have labels on the back country cow trails another reviewer complained of. The fact is, neither do the roads. But it's often helpful when you come to the fork in a dirt two-track and they both wander off a few degrees off North, to be able to crack open the Delorme and discover the one on the left plays out just over that hill over there at a windmill. There's no excuse for needing labels these days. A compass and Delorme will allow you to locate yourself in most instances.<br />However, even the back woods purist ought to own a GPS. I've been wandering around the back woods longer than most readers of this have been alive. I rarely get lost, but I frequently don't know exactly where I am. Occasionally my old TrailBlazer saved me a lot of walking to get back to the truck. Once it saved my life in a snowstorm, I imagine.<br />For motor traveling you'll cover too much ground to allow the 7.5 minute maps to help much. You pass from one map to the next too quickly. When you are afoot a couple of them become useful. Meanwhile, I use Delorme as one of the ways to keep track of my wanderings. I recommend them wherever you are. And a GPS, as well.	2003-09-18

Unfortunately, this book doesn't prove it.  Only after reading the book several times did I become convinced there's probably some solid fact behind the Zuni origin she proposes.<BR>One of the problems with the book in my view is the temptation Ms. Davis indulges to become an apologist for the Native American past.  This leads her into directions she needn't have followed with time better spent supporting her own premises.  Her attempts to find unlikely possibilities to explain evidence of NA cannibalism are one example.  The fact is we humans have such things in our history.  All of us.   There's no reason, nor any excuse for attempting to mitigate such facts, nor to apologize for them.<BR>The Zunis are a strange people.  I've read some of the other reviews suggesting Zunis look the 'same as other Indians in the southwest', which I'd disagree with.  The various tribes, including Zunis don't look the same as one another.  People who live in this area can usually tell a Zuni or a Navajo (or Acoma, Laguna, Mescalero) from one another from a distance.  To suggest the tribes look alike is probably a matter most southwesterners would find objectionable.  I'd say Zunis look more like Japanese than, say, Mescaleros do, or than Navajos do.<BR>In any case I think the Davis book is worth reading because of the interesting premise.  I wish she'd had the time to pursue the matter further than she did.	2003-09-17

Although the killing hasn't gotten a lot of interest in the last half-century, once everyone knew about it.  Fountain and his son were brutally murdered east of Las Cruces at a time when the residents of Territorial New Mexico were murdering one another over party politics. The tale is a long and bloody one and Gibson does an excellent job of retelling it.  An interesting footnote to the story Gibson mentions is that Pat Garrett, the famed lawman who killed Billy the Kid, was murdered while he was still investigating the Fountain homicide.<BR>Readers interested in New Mexico history won't go wrong buying this book.	2003-09-17

Lee, Including the Life of Brigham Young	Books	5	25	38	N	N	An American Tragedy	The Mountain Meadows massacre is one of those events in history that is too large for partisanship.  John Lee and what happened to him is no more, no less a matter worth understanding than Mountain Meadows.  Here is a book that comes as nearly as any is likely to ever approach to help students of history and the human condition grasp how abysmal that condition can become.  John Lee was a good man who found himself killing men, women and children in cold blood.  Anything to help humans understand how he came to do this is worth the read.  Certain similar massacres of Vietnamese civilians by US troops, the Cambodian killing fields, the Nazi concentration camps and Spanish Inquisition are a single facet of humanity painful to examine.  But we all need to examine them.  This book is a good place to begin.	2003-09-17

There's no better expert on metal detector technology than Garrett. Great as those detectors are, they require some training to use them.  Garrett provides the best 'how-to' advice available.  His book will give you the straight-forward means to practice with it before you begin trekking into the canyons or sweeping old school yards for coins.

This book makes none of them.<br /><br />Mountain Meadows was a context tragedy.  An army of US soldiers was headed for Utah.  The commander of had sworn to 'try and hang Brigham Young for treason'.  The entire Mormon community was in an uproar, preparing to fight.  They'd been driven until there was nowhere to run.<br /><br />The Fancher train was in the wrong place at the right time and became the victim of Mormon fear, Mormon frustration, Mormon anger built up for many years prior to the event.<br /><br />I'm not a Mormon and I don't condone what happened at Mountain Meadows, but the tragedy was a human one with all the flaws and weaknesses we humans indulge.  A cornered, harassed people can be expected to react in unexpected ways.<br /><br />In 1857, at Mountain Meadows Mormons responded as humans often do after they've been treated as less than human by their fellow men, beaten, property confiscated, homes burned, murdered.<br /><br />I love to see new books about Mountain Meadows.  The event is one worthy of study by all of us.  This book, however, isn't worthy of the author and it isn't worthy of the time a reader will spend reading it.  It wouldn't be worthy if it didn't cost a cent.  There are plenty of others, well written, thoroughly researched, but with no axes to grind by the author.<br /><br />Mountain Meadows and books about it have become something of a focus, a center point in disputes over opinions about Mormonism, which isn't what Mountain Meadows is about.  We've easily forgotten Comanche, Apache depredations in the West.  We've forgotten Little Big Horn, Wounded Knee, Andersonville Prison, the Japanese US citizen detention camps during WWII and other products of the fear and anger of our ancestors on all sides.  Mountain Meadows is a historical event, nothing else.  No one alive today is to blame for it.<br /><br />Read the the books about the history of this tragedy and learn something about ourselves.	2003-09-17

The Wilbarger book is a series of accounts of the turmoil on the front lines of human encounter.
