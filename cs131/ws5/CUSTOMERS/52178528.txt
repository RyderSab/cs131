There are certainly more talented writers.  Baldur's Gate wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it certainly was a \\"loose\\" adaption of the computer game...too loose.  Definitely better than the forgettable \\"Against the Giants\\" by uber-hack Ru Emerson or the all-to quick \\"Pool of Radiance, but not up to the enjoyable \\"White Plume Mountain\\" sequence.  Try those first before bothering with this one.	2005-09-27

It looks cleaner, includes some new elements (the specialist class for PCs, flavor text, new and reorganized skills, more feats, three prestige classes (guildmaster, militia leader, and spellcrafter), magic items, an appendix on work areas, about 30 expert types (like miners, blacksmiths, sages, courtesans, exterminators, slavers) with fully developed sample NPCs, ideas on expert advancement without combat, a chapter on guilds, and some new concepts such as convergence tasks.

Particularly striking is her relentless repetition of the claim that former Vice President Al Gore falsely suggested that he was the inspiration for the book &quot;Love Story&quot; -- a claim Coulter makes four separate times. As Robert Parry noted in an article in the Washington Monthly, author Erich Segal told the New York Times in a Dec. 14, 1997, article that Gore was indeed part of the inspiration for the main character in the novel. Gore did mistakenly say that the character of Jenny had been based on his wife Tipper, but he based this comment on an incorrect report in the Nashville Tennessean.&quot;<br />Here's another:<br />&quot;Another favorite tactic of Coulter's is the use of deceptive paraphrases to distort others' viewpoints. Blogger Scoobie Davis has noted that Coulter misrepresents the views of Frank Rich and Bruce Ackerman on the war on terrorism. Early in the book, Coulter writes that &quot;New York Times columnist Frank Rich demanded that [Attorney General John] Ashcroft stop monkeying around with Muslim terrorists and concentrate on anti-abortion extremists.&quot; The column that she cites, however, makes no such argument. Coulter also writes that &quot;Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman recommended dropping the war against global terrorism ('declare war at the first decent opportunity'!) and instead concentrate on 'home-grown extremists.'&quot; Yet Ackerman's column suggests a cautious approach to a global war on terrorism, not &quot;dropping&quot; it, and nowhere does he advocate concentrating on domestic terrorists instead of international terrorists. Coulter's paraphrases are both wild distortions.&quot;	2004-06-27

I've seen this theme before in books that predate this one - most of it in Heinlein, some of it in Asimov.  The Forever War has a very Foundation (which I despise) feel - instead of opening vaults every century, the protagonist pops out of his latest battle into the most recent permutation of developing society.  It's roots in Starship Troopers are plain - the plot is almost identical:  kid goes through boot camp, spends time on spacecraft, fights battles against mysterious aliens while wearing powersuits, becomes an officer, fights heroically.  All that said, there are many better martial sci-fi novels out there (Starship Troopers, War Games, Hammer's Slammers, Dune), and many better time travel / future shock books (The Time Machine, A World Out of Time, Number of the Beast (barely)).<br />The book also struck me as incredibly unimaginative - the author is a college grad (astronomy degree) who fought in Vietnam and now teaches writing.  The protagonist is a physics degree graduate who wants to be a teacher but gets drafted.  Give me a break.  This is certainly &quot;write what you know&quot; taken to the 3rd degree.  Oh, right, and it is certainly dated - it has a very 70s feel - kind of &quot;Deerhunter&quot; (the movie) crossed with &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (which was at least innovative and daring, having been written and published before &quot;hippie free love&quot; really kicked in.<br />As a combat vet myself (though nothing as harrowing as a full year in Vietnam), I would say that the combat scenes are described reasonably well, although you'd be better off reading John Keegan's non-fictional &quot;The Face of Battle&quot;, one of the best depictions of life on the battlefield.  I'd also recommended the autobiographical-but-fictional &quot;Fields of Fire&quot;, by James Webb (a Vietnam double amputee who was awarded the Navy Cross) -  Haldeman's &quot;Mandella&quot; would probably have his *** handed to him by &quot;Snake&quot;.<br />Some will Grok it, some won't.

A number of related skills are included.  Plus at least a dozen new feats, including \\"Expert Pilot\\", \\"Fearless\\", and \\"Snatch\\".  Some new equipment, including Mechanist Armor and Trebuchets, new magic items such as the \\"Dwarven Firewagon\\", new spells, and a few useful appendices that cover things like Elephant Warfare, Chariot Warfare, and Heraldry.<br />Like I said, it is really crunchy.	2003-08-25

Plenty of diagrams and charts assist in the visualization of sometimes difficult concepts.  The book's only real flaws are that it is a bit out of date (15 years) and that the editing is a bit dense - every couple pages one runs across extremely abstruse phrasing or grammatical errors.

WizardsOTC had the golden opportunity to produce the canonical product to encompass 19th, 20th, and 21st century role-playing.  Instead, they gave us orcs with firearms.  There are plenty of source-books and games out there that simulate these eras better than d20 Modern - for instance, Call of Cthulhu, Spycraft, even d20 Traveller.<br />It's clear that the designers and developers are out of touch with their audience.	2002-11-26

It is fully developed - tons of skills, classes, feats, and equipment.  The combat rules are logical and lethal.  Starship combat, psionics, and planetary generation are well-designed and incorporated, drawing on twenty years of game development.  The \\"Imperium\\" background is vague enough to allow plenty of flexibility when designing the setting while still providing enough of an inspiration framework to avoid doing it from scratch.<br />The game is a hard-science sci-fi roleplaying game - more Star Trek or Foundation than Star Wars.
