Its Saladin and Richard are the characters a novelist would have them be -- tailored to fit his plot line, thinking the thoughts he wants them to think, driven by the desires and emotions he wants them to have. Any relationship between these shallow, crudely-drawn characters and the real thing is not only accidental but unimportant. The point of the book is to teach the reader that there were good guys and bad guys and that we (the West) were the bad guys, while throwing in sex and violence in the bargain. And so it presents a simplified, technicolor version that leaves out the historical doubts, factual uncertainties, and other shades of grey that make for good history but bad B movies.<br />Who were the good guys and who the bad? Read Runciman's books (his Volume 3 covers the Third Crusade) -- they present history and let you decide for yourself.	2004-05-03

As one of the earlier reviews reflects - and as the book itself clearly expects - this interpretation of the evidence highly offends those for whom ideology trumps acheology. The books' tone is rather dry; this is written as a scholarly work, not a popularization, and may not be exciting reading except for archeology majors.	2003-10-07

But while Lomborg takes the tone of an open-minded observer believing what the numbers tell him, Hayden is a polemicist using the numbers to convince you of his own strongly-held beliefs. Some may enjoy this approach. But whether it is useful in advancing the debate -- particularly when people tend to read such a book, or not, depending upon whether they already agree with its premise, or not (a problem Lomborg apparently tried to avoid) -- is debatable.<br />What is not really debatable is that the book is not well edited: it could have been better organized, the graphs are generally not well done, and in several places its points could have been more clearly made. The publisher's editorial staff did not serve the author well here (unless the two are the same; I am not familiar with Vales Lake and a quick check does not reveal that it has published anything else).<br />That said, the book is nevertheless worth reading for those interested in the subject. Lomborg's much better book is also much longer and does not address these specific issues in detail. Hayden's argument, though dyspeptic, is convincing. Those who disagree will need to do better than to write \\"reviews\\" ranting that they did not read the book and that the world will end in 2050.	2002-08-15

The book basically says \\"pay attention to your driving\\" and \\"drive defensively.\\" But it concretely teaches them what to do in order to put these concepts into effect.  <br />Older drivers, who already try to practice those ideas, will get some useful information from this book but they should not expect to be better drivers after reading it. Aside from a few details -- how to adjust the mirrors, for example -- the more advanced driving techniques it recommends must be learned and practiced. Most people are not going to have the time, the empty space, and the several sets of tires necessary adequately to do so. If you really want to learn them, the thing to do is to go to a driving school (which one at times suspects is the point of the book).	2002-08-15

This is the book for him. It teaches him what cooking is all about and how to do it. It tells him what equipment he needs. It gives him receipes for good food that he can actually make himself and the knowledge to be able to prepare food even without them. And it does all this in a form that will interest him and, more importantly, that he will not be embarrassed to have. <br />The same can be said for old codgers who never learned how to cook except that, as other reviewers have alluded to, the book's design was clearly intended for those too young to need reading glasses.	2002-08-13

Everything that the two earlier reviewers have said is true and needn't be repeated. The bottom line is this: if you are very interested in the subject, and have already read about it to some extent, then you must read this book. It is astonishly rich in ideas -- almost too much so; and many of the observations that Southern makes in a seemingly casual way can give such blinding insight that you may find yourself stopping for several minutes at a time just to marvel at what you've read.  <br />One the other hand, this book is for serious students of history (it was originally devised for a college course). Those casually interested in finding out &quot;what happened&quot; in the middle ages will find it boring and useless.	2002-08-13

Ogburn's views generally convince those who will examine the historical evidence. It is not fantasy to think that they may eventually prevail, as literary historians who have not already committed themselves to the Stratfordian view gradually replace those who have. But it will take time. The problem is not so much the &quot;you're all crackpots&quot; attitude nor the &quot;you're prejudiced against the uneducated&quot; attitude -- both reflected in earlier reviews. The problem is that if the traditional attitude is true then &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was a transcendent, almost mystical genius, whereas if the Oxfordian theory is true then &quot;Shakespeare&quot; was a great genius but one whose inspiration obviously came -- as it has for most great writers -- from his own life and experiences. To bring him &quot;down to earth&quot; like that will be emotionally wrenching. But the parallels between the writings of &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and de Vere's life seem overwhelming. <br />Ogburn's views have been popularized in other books but this -- a summary of his much-longer book -- is better. Read it to see what the history books may say fifty years from now.	2002-08-13

This is casual storytelling based on old newspaper articles rather than a comprehensive history, though it is supplemented at times with historical documents Sikorsky has examined. It is, in any event, good storytelling and there is no particular reason to doubt the basic accuracy of the newspaper articles. It provides a entertaining look at the main versions of the legend and the personalities surrounding it. <br />Whether you will be convinced that there is nothing to the legend, as another reviewer has suggested, is a different question. I am not sure that the book even wants to give that impression. One could equally well conclude that there might have been something up there once -- perhaps before the Dutchman even claimed to find his &quot;mine&quot; -- but that it is almost surely long gone, leaving behind a fantasy fit for con men, crooks, and fools -- and (this is my own excuse) those for whom the fantasy makes it a bit more fun to hike in the Supersitions.	2002-08-13

This brief, scholarly look at his life and times attempts to separate legend from reality. The first half sets the scene by reviewing Iberian politics, religion, and society in the early middle ages; the second recounts the historical events in which El Cid played a role, relying on four near-contemporary sources (which are analyzed in a chapter that divides the two halves). A final chapter discusses when and how the legend arose.<br />The first half of the book is its strength. It is El Cid's context -- the interaction of peoples and states across the border between Islam and Christianity -- that intrigues, and Fletcher presents an interesting overview. The second half moves nicely through the minutiae of mid-11th-century Spanish politics but demonstrates that most of the few things history (as opposed to legend) knows about El Cid are not terribly interesting.<br />The book is well-written and should please those interested in its rather narrow subject matter.	2001-07-15

And so the author tells us how he came to the idea of an article about screws and screwdrivers; he tells us about the libraries he went to to research it, the books he read, and their authors lives; he describes the museums he visited and the displays he saw there; and he describes the stream of consciousness that led him along the way. The result is a non-chronological treatment that can be a bit confusing; and although structured as a detective story, using hints from obscure books and museums to trace a path steadily farther back into history, the materials in the last chapter -- on the use of screw devices in the ancient world -- are actually the most commonly known and available. But the story is pleasantly told and along the way we do learn what there apparently is to know about the history of the screw and screwdriver.	2001-07-15

Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book.

I add this review simply to suggest that they may have gone a bit over the top. This is a fine book but it is more a history of the Bible in English than of the KJV itself. Its discussions of such things as the rise of the Puritan movement, the religious policies of various English monarchs, and the printing industry in England and the Low Countries are interesting and informative for those with a good basic knowledge of the history of the period but may be somewhat heavy going for others. Its comparisons of passages from various different translations demonstrate well how much the KJV depends on earlier versions but beyond that become tedious. Despite its frequent quotations from Biblical texts, several of which are repetitive, it actually mentions relatively few specific examples of the KJV's influences on the language.<br /> This is a good book but is more a solid four-star than a five-star, exclamation-pointed experience.	2001-07-15

It should be a case-study in poor editing. Apparently, no one ever quite decided who the audience was, and so it falls between any: though aimed at the general  reader it is in essence a summary of technical literature - complete with  maths, graphs, equations (more than a couple), and citations of authority  in quasi-academic style. The text is at least one or two drafts from being  finished; there are inadvertent repetitions, important points blurred or  glossed over, paragraphs broken badly, and several discussions (including  an entire chapter) that are off-topic and mostly pointless. McGowan's  personal stories and asides are not well-integrated, as if an afterthought  tacked on simply to soften his rather dry style. The illustrations are  small, the photographs few and not directly relevant to the text. <br />  McGowan seems to know what he is writing about; he needs an editor firmer  and more adept and a publisher willing to put more money into the  production.	2000-04-15

Keegan's forte is broad-brush analysis of the nature and causes of war, and of that he does a good job here. Beyond the first few  chapters, though, the book is a rather sparse restatement of official  histories (but including the numbers and names of individual battalions,  brigades, etc, a convention common in official histories but pointless and  annoying in a brief popular history). Another serious weakness is that the  maps are few, inadequate, and not entirely correct. Finally, though Keegan  never did mix dependant clauses gracefully his style here is particularly  cryptic; many sentences need two or three readings to untangle.<br />  Those who buy this perfectly adequate but not outstanding book for its  author's name - which one suspects was the whole idea in the first place:  another Keegan book to sell - will be delighted by the first few chapters  and disappointed by the rest. Those who buy it to learn a little bit about  the First World War, though, will not do too badly.	2000-04-15

They love peering at every frazzled appendage, ragged bump, and slimy excretion and then announcing that it is a truly wonderful bug, that we all should love it, and that to think it ugly, clumsy, or offensive fails to perceive and appreciate its glorious evolution. These people write dictionaries. Others believe that, as with any tool, there are advantages in using the tool of language carefully. They believe that there are good bugs and bad bugs and that none should be used in soup. These people write books on usage. The two groups are often at odds since they write with different intention; Webster's inflamed the controversy in 1961, when it decided not to tell readers of its third unabridged dictionary which words were slang, colloquial, etc. (this oversimplifies; I do not have W3 at hand). <br /> A usage book by dictionary people - especially Webster's - would be a contradiction in terms were this a serious book. At heart, it is not. It is also not a usage book. It is a polemic against usage writers. A typical entry examines what usage writers have had to say about a word or construction and then announces that they were misguided, ignorant, or merely wrong. The tone is overtly patronizing and obnoxious; one can almost hear in the background, a la Beavis and Butthead, the authors' self-congratulatory sniggering. The moral is that usage is a pesky, pedantic thing best ignored in favor of saying whatever feels good. Feeling good is perhaps what this book is really about: don't worry if you have ever made one of these mistakes because it is not a mistake after all - the other guy was wrong, not you. <br /> Are usage writers ever misguided, ignorant, or wrong? Yes, especially since too many are dilettante journalists and free-lancers peddling old wives' tales and personal whim. That does not mean that if you write as well as a bug does people will love you. If you are looking for a guide to usage, look elsewhere. Fowler's (Second Edition, not the recent Third) is probably still the best.	2000-04-01

It is for the rest of us - those bewildered by the whole Martha Stewart phenomenon. It turns out to be not all that different from most media phenomena. We already knew that people  armed with nothing but fanatical self-promotion can become famous singers,  actors, authors, politicians, businessmen, etc. Now we know that they can  also become whatever it is Martha Stewart is supposed to be. This is an  interesting story but hardly unique: a self-made media personality whose  image is largely artificial. To give her her due, Stewart is an extreme  example: she manages to be a cook without cooking, a writer without  writing, an editor without editing, and a salesman without selling much  except herself. Perhaps Oppenheimer's treatment is too harsh -  the person  he describes is clearly suffering from a personality disorder - but he has  talked to a lot of people and names names.

It reveals few &quot;secrets&quot; except to describe the Temple initiation ceremony in superficial detail. It is  primarily about the author's love life. Those drawn to Harlequin romance  may choose to consider her the tragic victim of a repressive cult; others  may consider that even a repressive cult is not an entirely satisfactory  explanation for being shallow, vain, and not terribly bright.	2000-02-27
