But I think the writing here is a LOT funnier.  The inter-personal relationships struck me as a bit more complex and confusing that those in John Blackburn's Coley novel, BREATHLESS-- but that just means I need to go re-read it again.  With a book this fun that's something I look forward to.  (And generally, I barely have time to read most comics once!) <br /> <br />A friend of mine once commented how she thought, in WEST SIDE STORY, that Tony had more \\"chemistry\\" with Maria's brother than he did with Maria.  That got me howling, and I replied that may explain why her brother was so hot for a fight.  I was reminded of that exchange when Jane & Chelle spend half the book getting mad at each other...  then, SUDDENLY, fall into each other's arms.  I suppose this happens in \\"real life\\" a lot... but it's not any kind of relationship I'd want to be in!  All the same, it's fun to watch the fireworks from the sidelines. <br /> <br />Now I'm looking forward to reading Vol.2.  I've just gotta see what happens on the ski trip.	2005-09-01

Highlights: <br /> <br />\\"NEWCOMER Part Two\\" and \\"MOVE YOUR ASSES\\" by \\"STEPAN ZUBINSKI\\" - The follow-up to the stunner from last time features more submissive \\"training\\" in a far future world. The 2nd story involves a new guy on a football team. The art looks rushed on these; I'm not sure if less was put into it, or if the reproduction is just seriously \\"off\\". I'm wondering what the original art looked like? <br /> <br />\\"DADDY'S HOME\\" by \\"FARRADAY\\" - light-hearted romp where fantasy meets \\"true love\\". As usual, Farraday's writing far outshines the art. <br /> <br />\\"HAWK: BACK STAIRS\\" by GREG GARCIA - The biker returns to the house where he \\"served\\" 10 years earlier for a reunion and reminisce about the years in between. <br /> <br />\\"BAWDY BUCCANEERS\\" by \\"MIKE\\" - Pirates are the subject this time, with far more detail in the art than usual. <br /> <br />\\"GOLDENLOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS\\" by GERALD DONELAN - a 4-page variation on the fairy tale, plus 7 more of Donelan's light-hearted cartoons. <br /> <br /> <br />This book can be ordered direct from A Different Light Bookstore, or direct from Leyland Publications.	2005-08-25

One of the hottest stories in the book. <br /> <br />\\"COLEY ON THE EDGE:  ROLLER BOOGIE HOTROD\\" by JOHN BLACKBURN -- The 2nd MEATMEN installment with Coley Cochran, voodoo-endowed blonde bi-boy has him putting on a street exhibition on wheels, then tactfully hitching a ride from a pair of admirers before the cops arrive.  Next thing you know, they're back at the guy's place for a hot \\"69\\" while his girlfriend watches.  This also appeared as the 3rd episode (of 5) in Blackburn's COLEY: WILD IN THE STREETS book.

Quite an achievement, putting all this together in one book! <br /> <br />As usual, not everything will appeal to everyone, but I do have my own favorites... <br /> <br />NICO -- wonderfully photo-realistic style, both covers and 2 short stories inside (The Biker, 2 Blondes) for a total of 10 pages altogether. <br /> <br />\\"COME WARS\\", a 16-page \\"tribute\\" to STAR WARS, x-rated of course.  The first of many appearances by \\"SEAN\\"; I'd love to see all his stories collected in a single book one of these days. <br /> <br />\\"HARRY CHESS:  The Curse Of Kahlua Blewa\\" by \\"A.JAY\\" -- A really funny serial that mixes spies, adventure & sex.  My one problem with this is the art is shrunk down to fit the vertical format of the book, when it should have been MUCH bigger.  There's just too much detail here that gets lost, and I'm sure I'd have had an easier time enjoying it if I didn't feel I needed a magnifying glass to do so. <br /> <br />\\"MEATMAN Meets The Monstrous Milking Machine\\" by \\"STEPHEN\\" -- from 1975-76, an early gay superhero parody, almost non-stop sex for 15 pages. <br /> <br />\\"POPPERS\\" by JERRY MILLS -- funny, cartoony short stories. <br /> <br />\\"BILLY GOES OUT\\" by HOWARD CRUSE -- more drama than sex, but Cruse shows everyone else how to do \\"real\\" comics! <br /> <br />Other highlights include \\"JAYSON\\" by Jeffrey A. Krell, \\"MURPHY'S MANOR\\" by Kurt Erichsen, \\"LEONARD AND LARRY\\" by Tim Barella, 2 photo-realistic illustrations accompanying a pair of text pieces by \\"Blade\\", 4 cartoons by Gerald Donelan (consistently one of the best parts of any MEATMEN collection) and 2 very \\"Disney\\"-style cartoons by Gregoire-- I'd LOVE to see a lot more from this guy!	2005-07-29
US	50824163	R3VDTWYLKN387M	1560975547	385424487	Coley Running Wild Book 3: Hard Throb (Eros GN 40) (Hard Throb Eros Graphic Albums) (Bk. 3)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Young Love and Primeval Danger!	Coley Vol.3 collects the last 2 mini-series from Eros to date, and what a contrast they are!   <br /> <br />In HARD THROB, Coley, having returned to Seaside, CA., divides his time between shooting a porn movie and finding new sexual conquests on the streets and in back alleys.  But the unexpected occurs when he meets Cort, a young man just coming of age to whom the attraction may be more than just sex.  Some of the dialogue in the later part of this story is a bit awkward, but this actually works as a reflection of how Coley, though extremely street-wise and worldly, has been suppressing truly deep emotions for too many years. <br /> <br />The follow-up, DAGGER OF BLOOD, stands as the WILDEST Coley adventure to date!  Harry, Coley, Lon & the film crew travel down to South America to do a film on location, but Harry has an ulterior motive for going.  The cult from IDOL OF FLESH has sprung up again, and Harry decides the best way to handle them is to face them head-on, rather than waiting to be picked off at someone's leisure.  This proves a far more dangerous and ill-advised course than anyone could have imagined, and before it's over they become prisoners of the cult, whose members include an insane ex-Nazi surgeon who combines science & sorcery in shocking & unspeakable ways. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Coley is reunited with Kit (last seen in THE DEATHSNAKE) in one of the most beautifully-drawn scenes in the entire series.  He also gets hot-and-heavy with their guide, Danny, and the eventual 3way with Coley & Lon is one of the HOTTEST scenes ever.  Then things turn strange... and then NASTY. <br /> <br />I had to read this all the way through twice before I was really sure what was going on between part 2 & 3.  I strongly suspect a couple of pages were somehow lost before the initial printing, and if so, this collection-- which could have fleshed things out better-- doesn't.  The entire story is there, if you read the text carefully, but the capture of Lon & Danny bythe cult really should have been SHOWN, not merely described verbally.  If I were publishing this, I'd have requested John Blackburn add a few extra pages in to allow the story to flow better. <br /> <br />Despite this, DAGGER OF BLOOD remains one of my favorite of all Coley stories.  Blackburn's art reached a new peak here, and the sex scenes are just amazing.  With a busy schedule, I barely have time to read anything more than once these days, but I've read this at least 3 TIMES so far.  Now, if only John would do a follow-up regarding the fate of Lon & Kit...!!!	2005-04-15
US	50824163	R2PJZFCLMRTS9Q	0943595290	343784053	Meatmen, Vol. 12	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Vol.12:  SCI-FI Edition!	This volume of MEATMEN stands out from most for 2 reasons:  it has fewer & longer features, and all have a sci-fi theme. <br /> <br />THE highlight of the book is \\"HOT PURSUIT\\", a 40-page opus by artist Stephen Lowther & writer Howard Stangroom (once a member of comics-a.p.a. KLORDNY).  Heavy on plot, action & drama, the art is very much in the style of many 1970's Marvel comics, while having it broken into chapters was common among many early-1960's Marvels.  Lowther also did both color covers, and alone his contributions would have made a terrific \\"Annual\\" in the old days. <br /> <br />\\"PROJECT EXODUS\\" is another epic, this one 31 pages in length, but made entirely of full-page illustrations by \\"Mike\\".  I like his \\"clean\\" linework, but his distorted anatomy does little for me.  The story of a future Earth about to be abandoned far outshines the visuals, and this may be the best thing I've seen from him. <br /> <br />\\"CRYOGENICS\\" seems to have predicted the pilot episode of FUTURAMA by quite a few years, with its hero accidentally frozen, only to awake in a very different world-- where everyone is homosexual!  There's been 2 sequels so far, in Vols.15 & 19.  \\"Farraday\\"'s layouts & storytelling continue to impress me, but I think he'd be better off either improving his drawing, or teaming with a better illustrator to do his stories more justice. <br /> <br />\\"MASTER OF MASTERS\\" is something different from \\"Sean\\", whose excellent work has appeared in Vols. 1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 14 and 16-21.  This time it's all full-page illustrations, which allow much more detail than usual.  As I suspected, these \\"pulp\\"-style pages originally accompanied a story serialized in LEATHERMAN'S WORKBOOKS Vols. 2-8 (many MEATMEN features are reprints that appeared elsewhere, earlier).  Some of the HOTTEST art in this book, these work even without the text! <br /> <br />Gerald Donelan contributes 10 of his always-delightful cartoons;  Jeffrey A. Krell's humorous JAYSON has an adventure on another planet;  Greg Garcia's \\"BIG BANG\\" involves black holes in space; and Kurt Erichsen's \\"ROBOT LOVE\\" involves a salesman trying to turn the tide away from mechanical sex BACK to the \\"organic\\" variety. <br /> <br />Definitely less sex than usual this time, but absolutely readable throughout.	2005-04-14
US	50824163	R10E5SVBAQVMGU	0816640068	433043544	Harmful To Minors: The Perils Of Protecting Children From Sex	Books	4	29	38	N	N	ESSENTIAL Antidote to HYSTERIA	This is one of the most IMPORTANT books I've run across in decades.  Extremely well-researched, generally well-written, and unquestionably eye-opening to anyone with intelligence whose mind is not already long-closed.  I first ran across this book on the website of a bookstore in Amsterdam, and made a note of it.  More recently, it turned up on a list compiled by some radical nut-case religious extremists-- in the same section of said list as a book I had published!  So I KNEW I had to read it.  <br />I wasn't disappointed.  It was mesmerizing.  I read it cover-to-cover in less than a week.  I was alternately enlightened and enraged, as I recognized so many situations and attitudes from my own life that I could relate to, if at times only indirectly.  I grew up in an atmosphere of FEAR (OF my parents), fear that was so all-pervading it made establishing relationships in my life later on extremely difficult.  That so many should be afraid of something so important and intrinsically HUMAN as sex that they should pass on FEAR and HYSTERIA rather than unbiased information and LOVE is a crime against ALL humanity.<br />I think one quote best sums up the entire volume (but don't miss the rest):<br />\\"Trying to fortify the nuclear family by fomenting suspicion of strangers fractures the community of adults and children;  it can leave children defenseless in abusive homes.  Projecting sexual menace onto a cardboard monster and pouring money and energy into vanquishing him distracts from teaching children the subtle skills of loving with both trust and discrimination.  Ultimately, children are rendered more vulnerable both at home and in the world.\\"	2004-07-08

It WASN'T when Gwen Stacy was murdered (which, after all these years, it turned out it was John Romita's...idea).  And no-it WASN'T even when Stan Lee stopped writing \\"his\\" main character!!!  NO!!!  It was when GIL KANE started DRAWING the [darn] book, THAT'S when!!!  Kane's people are UGLY, his anatomy is AWKWARD, and his storytelling has NO sense of fun or humor about it at ALL!!!  Most of these I'd never read before, and I got the book mainly because it was a CHEAP way to fill these huge gaping holes in my Spidey collection.  MY GOD!!  Reading these is like watching the 6th season of HUNTER.  Sure, Dee Dee McCall was still there, but the whole tone, balance and focus of the show had gone terribly astray, thanks to Fred Dryer's massive ego getting in the way.  <br />There's a few issues with pure JOHN ROMITA art, which are a joy to behold compared to the rest.  (Romita plotted \\"Vengeance In Viet Nam\\" all on his own, it was his big Milton Caniff tribute!)  There's also a couple near the end which had Romita pencilling over layouts by JIM STARLIN!  But overall, the tone of the series had gotten very dark, downbeat and pessimistic.  In a word-- unbearable.<br />For anyone who'd wonder why I have NO interest in reading ANY new Spider-books ever again, here it is.  I have BOXES of the stuff in my back room, and don't have the time for that right now-and that's the GOOD stuff!  To me, there are 2 and ONLY 2 Spider-Man artists who matter--  Steve Ditko and John Romita.  Everybody else is just wasting their time trying to fill their shoes.  30 years is a LONG time for a character to be living off his past reputation!	2003-06-04
US	50824163	RQC9YNATNML83	094359586X	144829503	Meatmen: An Anthology of Gay Male Comics (Volume 25)	Books	4	15	21	N	N	Vol.25:  The Slickest Collection Yet?	10 artists contribute to the raunchy proceedings this time, with more highlights than usual.  \\"Teasy Meat\\" by Zack (the cover story) is about a porn director who'll stop at nothing to get what-and who-he wants.  \\"Going Long.... ....Going Deep\\" by Farraday is a comedy about a football players.  Farraday's writing continues to far out-distance his still-amateurish art, but the drawing's come a long way, as I see a lot of improvement with background details, anatomy and use of perspective.  \\"Stagecoach\\" by John Blackburn sees his Voodoo Love-God Coley Cochran in Western gear to entertain guests at a theme park.  As usual, this gets my vote as the HOTTEST story in the book, and surprisingly features a brief cameo by Quincey Quartermain, Coley's movie-producer / father-figure who to date has only appeared in the limited-edition graphic novel BREATHLESS (1991).  \\"The Longshot\\" by Joe features his usual well-muscled studs enjoying a 3-way in between beers.  \\"Newcomer\\" by Stepan Zubinski is a post-apocalytic sci-fi tale involving robots, mutants, gladiators and she-male geishas, all eager for sex and more sex, and features some of the most STUNNING artwork in the collection!  \\"Camilli-Cat And The Djinns\\" by Patrick Fillion is heavy on sex while short on plot, while the art is very slicky-rendered, the most \\"mainstream\\"-looking in style that would fit in well on many current DC or Marvel comics.  \\"Before Time & Space\\" by Jack Jacklin is a sci-fi-fantasy speculating on the origins of the universe; the line-rendering on the anatomy is a bit on the rough side, but otherwise the sense of design & storytelling is wonderful.  And finally, Gerald Donelan contributes 18 more of his delightful cartoons;  his work has been so consistently among the best parts of every MEATMEN volume I've bought that I'm fully expecting to see a collection, in the manner of Charles Addams or Gary Larson, one of these days!	2003-06-01
US	50824163	R3I7C67480XWN	0785108092	959966075	Marvel Masterworks: The X-Men, Vol. 3, Nos. 22-31	Books	3	12	12	N	N	Fun, if &quot;average&quot; stories of Marvel's &quot;Hard-Luck&quot; Heroes	Writer Roy Thomas &amp; artist Werner Roth had a tough act to follow when they became the regular creative team on X-MEN in the mid-60's (following Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and-- at times-- Chic Stone). These early stories may come as a shock to anyone used to the overly-complex, darkly angst-ridden nightmare world that the ever-growing number of X-books have become over the last 25 years.  They tend to finish in 1 or 2 issues, and Roth's art is almost refreshingly &quot;clean&quot;, light and upbeat!  With most of Marvel's books getting more visually &quot;spectacular&quot;, X-MEN may have seemed an &quot;outsider&quot; to the rest of the line at the time.  (Next to art by Jack Kirby on FANTASTIC FOUR, THOR &amp; CAPTAIN AMERICA, Gene Colan on IRON MAN and DAREDEVIL, John Romita on SPIDER-MAN and Jim Steranko on S.H.I.E.L.D., these X-MEN stories have a Saturday-morning cartoon look by comparison!)<br />Between X-MEN and THE AVENGERS, Roy was learning how to write comics on-the-job!  His dialogue is something I can only take in small doses here, as he tries to cram every available space with word balloons, whether it's called for or not.  Without Stan's sense of humor, Roy's plots have to stand on their own-- at times it feels like someone imitating a Marvel Comic more than an actual one.  Roy improved over time, as his later work on this series with Neal Adams proved.<br />A strange thought hit me by the end of the volume-- many of the featured villains were &quot;borrowed&quot; from other heroes' series!  This is evident in my favorite story here, the 2-parter with Count Nefaria and a group of hired super-villains.  You've got The Plantman and The Eel (Human Torch baddies from STRANGE TALES), The Scarecrow &amp; The Unicorn (Iron Man foes from SUSPENSE) and The Porcupine (an Ant-Man &amp; Wasp villain from ASTONISH, for cryin' out loud!).  They're all pretty much 2nd-stringers, yet it's fun seeing them almost act like a &quot;team&quot;!<br />One story has Jack Sparling art in such a different style it looks really odd in here-- all the rest are by Werner Roth.  Judging from some of the &quot;off-duty&quot; scenes it appears Roth may have been more comfortable with romance than superheroics (a trait he shared with Iron Man artist Don Heck).  One thing caught my attention reading this book-- Werner Roth's version of Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) bears an UNCANNY resemblance to actress Famke Janssen, who played the character in the recent X-MEN movie!  It was as though he'd used her for his model-- I wonder if the producers used Roth's art as reference while casting the film?	2002-05-20

As usual, the Coley installment is probably the BEST part of the entire book, in both writing AND artwork.  3 short episodes of &quot;Johnny Leatherhead&quot; by Stephen Clarke show a lot of potential in the art &amp; visual storytelling.  &quot;The Buddies And The Bastards&quot; by Sean is a fun romp in which a couple of guys stumble into the WRONG club initiation-- but the guys who take advantage of them get paid in kind by the end.  Gerald Donelan contributes another 12 cartoons, including the back cover.	2001-10-20

In the late 70's, in an attempt to compete with HEAVY METAL magazine, Warren Publishing put out &quot;1984&quot;, a B&amp;W anthology that took the company's usual mix of sci-fi, horror, fantasy &amp; mystery to a new level by adding S E X.  LOTS of it.  So much, in fact, that the magazine quickly spiraled downward into a morass of the worst trash imaginable, with terrible writing and even worse artwork.  Yet amidst this, one bright light shone-- a blonde warrior woman with a taste for blood as powerful as her appetite for sex-- GHITA OF ALIZARR, the wondrous creation of Frank Thorne.<br />Frank, a longtime commercial artist and sometime comic-book illustrator, had taken Marvel's RED SONJA to unprecedented heights of popularity-- until he left the series abruptly, in mid-story.  The character has NEVER been handled as well since.  Free of the restrictions of the Comics Code, Thorne created his own world from scratch and populated it with a mix of wizards, warriors, non-human creatures and supernatural monsters, and turned loose on the public an EPIC storyline about a quest to retake a city overrun by evil conquerors that reads like somebody should adapt it into a feature-film!<br />The episodic format of 1984 (later 1994), I feel, did not do justice to the storyline.  Reading it all together so many layers of character and intrigue are evident that I never picked up on before.  Ghita is neither heartless slut or murderous savage, but a warm-hearted woman of merely loose morals who spends the story battling as much for control of her soul (possessed by the spirit of a dead warrior-king) as she does slaying the infidels.  Along the way, she's accompanied by her steady friend Thenef (who poses as a mage) and Dahib (a half-troll who worships her as a goddess).<br />THE COMPLETE GHITA collects every episode to date-- both stories (the 2nd reprinted for the 1st time!) and a short story from Eros' THE EROTIC WORLDS OF FRANK THORNE.  It's a THICK book-- and one any fan of SONJA or XENA should have!  During its initial run, GHITA was often the ONLY feature worth reading in 1984/1994.  Now one can enjoy it to the fullest, without all the DRECK getting in the way!	2001-10-17

Fun, quirky, cartoony stuff!  Other highlights:  &quot;Virgin&quot;, starring &quot;Jack Masters Private Dick&quot; by Joven;  &quot;Coley Meets Doctor Sade&quot; by John Blackburn (one of his most bizarre episodes, this would have fit in an &quot;S&amp;M special&quot;-- OUCH!); &quot;Stud Stars&quot; by Sean (a pair of travelling guitarists &quot;play&quot; at a surprising venue); &quot;Murphy's Manor&quot; by Kurt Erichsen; and 12 more fun cartoons by Gerald Donelan (who gets both color covers this time out).	2001-10-01

Highlights this Volume:  &quot;Hot Shot Seamen&quot; by &quot;Joe&quot;, whose art is more &quot;pin-up&quot; than &quot;sequential storytelling&quot; in nature;  &quot;Jack Masters Private Dick:  Love&quot; by Joven, in which the P.I. (P.D.?) is hired by a jealous wife, only to find it's not other women her hubby is cheating on her with;  &quot;The 23rd Century Lovers&quot; by Farraday continues the &quot;Cryogenics&quot; story from Vol.15-- as usual, the story far outshines the amateurish art;  &quot;Coley:  Riverboat Boy&quot; by John Blackburn, in which the blonde voodoo boy loses at cards-- AND loves it;  &quot;Little Red Riding Crop&quot; by Kurt Erichsen-- more fun, humorous work;  &quot;Gang Bangers&quot; by Sean-- in which a lost biker runs into a wild bike gang;  and 12 more cartoons by Gerald Donelan.	2001-10-01

Other highlights:  &quot;Coley:  Bayou Boy&quot; by John Blackburn, in which the blonde voodoo boy has fun with a guy he meets in a riverfront bar (at least, until they're interrupted); &quot;Mythology Revisited&quot; by The Hun, wherein he experiments with fully-rendered graytone art;  &quot;Big Lay Down The Highway&quot; by Farraday, a fun tale about truckers shot from pencilled art (I just wish this guy would take some DRAWING classes!);  &quot;A Wedding In The Family&quot; by Kurt Erichsen, a comedy involving a guy trying to deal with a possessive mother; and &quot;Dune Buggers&quot; by Sean, in which a guy celebrates his birthday outdoors in the wild-- with a wild pack of friends!	2001-10-01

All the same, there are highlights:<BR>&quot;The Prisoners Of Lazareth&quot; &amp; &quot;Penetrating Heaven&quot; by Jon Macy are intriguing stories involving aliens from space and demons of hell-- I just wish the artwork lived up to the writing.  &quot;Heavy Loads&quot; by Joe involves truckers; Joe's overly-muscled art is very &quot;cleanly&quot; rendered, though the drawing is far better than the visual storytelling.  &quot;Murphy's Manor&quot; by Kurt Erichsen features cute, cartoony art &amp; thoughtful, fun writing.  &quot;Johnny Shadow&quot; by John Blackburn is, to date, the ONLY story I've seen him do with a hero other than his blonde character, Coley-- though the difference isn't that noticeable.  &quot;Friends&quot; featured &quot;Jack Masters Private Dick&quot; by Joven in a case involving gay-bashing.  &quot;Rapid Shooters&quot; by Sean has a group of guys wild-river rafting together (clothing optional).  And &quot;Jayson's Dream Man&quot; is another installment in Jeffrey A. Krell's humorous sitcom-like series.  Also worth a look is &quot;Broc Of The Stone Age&quot;, a silent story all told in full-page panels by &quot;Mike&quot;, whose rendering is far better than his actual drawing (the linework is very refined, but his human figures all have extremely distorted, exaggerated anatomy-- funny enough, his dinosaurs look fine!).  Gerald Donelan contributes 12 of his light-hearted cartoons this time.<BR>As usual, this series continues to feature a mix of good and really below-average work.  As a forum for &quot;up-and-coming&quot; talent that's to be applauded; I just wish the format didn't make such a mixed product so pricey!	2001-10-01

Most (if not quite all) the contributors did stories with a sci-fi angle-- robots, time-travel, space ships, you name it.<br />Highlights:  In Stephen Lowthar's &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot;, a suburbanite finds &amp; falls for the pilot of a crashed UFO-- the art here is among the closest to &quot;mainstream&quot; comics I've ever seen in MEATMEN.  &quot;Cryogenics&quot; by Farraday, a very good-natured tale about a man awoken in an all-gay future, which I enjoyed despite terribly amateurish art.  &quot;Dimension X&quot; by John Blackburn finds his blonde hero Coley transported by scientists to another world whose royal ruler is in dire need; one of my favorite Coley short stories, and one of the HOTTEST!  &quot;The Nine Billion Names Of Penis&quot; by Kurt Erichsen is an amusing encounter involving aliens on a quest for books of knowledge.  &quot;Rocket Riders:  Planet Of The Blondes&quot; by Greg Garcia &amp; &quot;Space Adventures Of Nick &amp; Seth&quot; by Joven provide more fun space antics with traditional (if not overly outstanding) art.  Cartoonist Gerald Donelan, always a joy, provides 9 cartoons this time, including front &amp; back color covers.  Also in this volume are 3 chapters of Jeffrey A. Krell's &quot;Jayson&quot;, a humorous TV sitcom-like strip.  These are lots of fun-- they just seem very out-of-place in an otherwise &quot;sci-fi&quot; issue!  (The rest I could do without-- but that's nothing new.)	2001-09-29
US	50824163	RWNC2LOMWP250	0943595770	877949810	Meatmen  Volume 24  Special SM Comics Edition	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Vol.24:  SM Special (ouch!)	All the stories this volume focus on SM, which probably will turn on some more than usual while making it too disturbing for others.  So it goes!<br />Highlights includes Zack's 3rd story in 3 issues, the 30-page &quot;Slaves To Lust&quot;;  John Blackburn's Coley in &quot;Baitbucket&quot;;  Stepan Zubinski's &quot;In The Kingdom Of The Snake God&quot;, featuring some of the most stunning artwork in the book, wherein a downed biplane pilot in Africa confronts sexual and supernatural forces head-on (so to speak!); and more cartoons from Gerard Donelan.  The rest I could do without, but that's about average for this series.  2 noticeable glitches found their way into this volume:  Zubinski's story has pages 3 &amp; 4 reversed, and Blackburn's story ends rather abruptly after only 12 pages.  The reason, as I suspected-- it was supposed to be 20 pages (as most Coley episodes in MEATMEN have been) but the editor apparently objected to something, causing some changes.  Geez, in a specifically &quot;SM&quot; issue, I wonder WHAT was considered as possibly &quot;going too far&quot;?	2001-09-06

Which is which may be a matter of personal taste, but I know what I like, and I keep wishing the excellent will one day outnumber the dreadful.<br />Highlights this volume:  John Blackburn's Coley in &quot;Body Heat&quot;, wherein the voodoo bi-boy helps a confused husband come to terms with who he really is;  &quot;Visitation Rites&quot; by Sean, where leather-clad bikers meet (and &quot;meat&quot;) campground guys;  &quot;The Sons Of Ramus&quot; by Joe, a dive into Greek mythology with decent art if not very strong visual storytelling; &quot;Link Up&quot; by Kurt Erichsen, a fun story about a computer nerd with some nice cartoony art;  and one-page cartoons by Gerard Donelan.  Blackburn gets to shine IN COLOR on both front and back covers this time, and in fact the back is possibly my very favorite single illo of Coley I've seen to date.  Can you say... &quot;HHHHHOT&quot;??	2001-09-06

Following up on Vol.22's &quot;Bike Boy&quot; is &quot;Message To The Emperor&quot; by Zack, a 30-page mini-epic which takes an innocent youth down a long road in ancient times toward a truly spectacular climax, with amazing art that really raises the book's standards a few notches.  (I only wish I could see it all in color, like the cover illo!)  As usual, the other highlights this time are Gerard Donelan's single-panel cartoons and the latest installment of John Blackburn's blue-eyed blonde bi-boy, Coley: &quot;Voodoo Swamp Angel&quot;.  Disturbing violence is portrayed side-by-side with incredibly erotic sequences-- standard stuff for Coley!  Between Zack &amp; Blackburn it's a toss-up as to which artist's work is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;hotter&quot;, but who cares?  I only wish ALL the work on display here was of this high quality!  (As for the rest-- oh well...)	2001-09-06
US	50824163	R3PO6L0DTLOYVV	0943595754	690290725	Meatmen  Volume 22	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Vol.22:  HOT mix of fantastic &amp; execrable	Winston Leyland's MEATMEN books each contain a widely varied mix of styles among their contributors.   With 160 pages on good paper with slick covers, they're a sizeable package (to borrow a turn of phrase), although I question the choice of some of the material.  Amateurish below-fanzine-level hackwork is presented side-by-side with stunning, exceptionally high-quality art, and this may turn off some potential paying customers.<br />Highlights of VOL.22 include: &quot;Bike Boy&quot; by Zack, very European-in-style art I only wish was printed in its original full color (as I discovered on a website); &quot;Coley On The Lost Coast&quot; by John Blackburn, one of the nicest and hottest Coley short stories to appear in MEATMEN (Blackburn has appeared in every collection from #13-up, often contributing the best work in each book);  cartoons by Gerard Donelan (cute and funny, another &quot;regular&quot; in this series);  and &quot;Straight Man's Burden&quot; by Kurt Erichsen (very entertaining with a cartoon style reminiscent of Phil Foglio's).<br />I've been buying the MEATMEN books mostly to have a complete run of &quot;Coley&quot; stories.  While I've enjoyed quite a few of the other features, if I had my druthers I'd enjoy seeing somebody collect all of Blackburn's short stories in a single volume (color optional!).  But until then, these are the only place to read them.	2001-09-06

Each contains adventure, mystery, romance, supernatural elements, violence, and sex(something for everyone!).  At times I find the violence disturbing, but the other elements more than balance things out.  Blackburn's work, and his young hero, \\"Voodoo Love God\\" Coley Cochran, are absolutely compelling.  A walking contradiction in terms who affects-- in one way or another-- EVERYONE whose path he crosses.<br />Some may find the heavy expository dialogue at the beginning confusing;  the truth is, there are 3 complete books that precede this one, which have only seen limited printing so far.  I hope this oversight is corrected one day!<br />Eros' \\"Graphic Novel\\" reprints only bug me for the numbering on the covers, which like Marvel's \\"Masterworks\\" in the late 80's, try to inspire readers to buy ALL of them, at the expense of better package design.  Oh well.  At least each Coley volume has its own numbering.	2001-08-02

In the mid-60's, comics veteran Jack Kirby was at the absolute height of his creative powers, knocking out more new characters and wild concepts in a few years than most creators are capable of in their entire careers.  But he was also frustrated, as his collaborator (& editor & boss) Stan Lee was not only failing to give him writing credit (and the pay that would go with it) but more and more had been \\"taking away\\" Jack's ideas and steering them in directions far different than what Jack intended (see SILVER SURFER for the boldest example).  As a result, Jack \\"held back\\" most new ideas after 1967... until he had the chance to switch companies, be in charge of his work and \\"do it his way\\".<br />It didn't QUITE work out that way.  Poor inks dragged down the first year's worth or art, and a better scripter who could have maintained Kirby's intent while polishing the result (perhaps Roy Thomas) would have been a help.  But Kirby's 4 connected titles, of which NEW GODS was the centerpiece, remain a ground-breaking epic of unmatched inventiveness & wild fun.  Not unlike George Harrison after The Beatles' breakup, Kirby let loose with everything he had-- possibly too much at once!  Dozens of characters and concepts that are STILL being used (and perhaps overused or abused) by DC Comics to this day, all appeared in around a 2-year period.  Orion, Darkseid, Highfather, Lightray, Desaad, Kalibak, Metron, New Genesis, Apokalips, Mother Box, The Boom Tube, The Anti-Life Equation, \\"The Pact\\"...<br />Anyone who'd prefer COLOR but can't find or afford the original issues (now 30 years old!) should seek out the 1984 reprint series-- especially since that contained a new 12th episode not found here.  And for those looking for fun of a more tangible kind, DC Direct has just released a \\"Deluxe Action Figure Set\\" of Orion & Darkseid!  (Not to be missed!)	2001-06-17

Following a comparitively low-key personal drama (HARD THROB), and the wildest globe-hopping supernatural adventure yet (DAGGER OF BLOOD) John Blackburn's bisexual \\"superman\\" Coley Cochran returns in an epic 168-page story-- a true \\"graphic novel\\" (in more ways than one).  Coley returns HOME-- and readers get to meet the family he left behind.  As usual, the complexities and interpersonal relations (so to speak) affect everyone in town, as long-time deep-rooted secrets, emotions & feelings of guilt all explode to the surface.  Along the way, Blackburn finds the time to depict MORE sex in MORE varieties than in all his previous Coley books put together!<br />Told at a leisurely pace, with several full-page illustrations that show off how accomplished his art has become, DESTINY COAST is a story that could easily be adapted into a feature film....	2001-06-09

Eros' &quot;Graphic Novel&quot; reprints of John Blackburn's COLEY books are a big help to readers who no longer have to worry about trying to follow the complex life of his voodoo-endowed bisexual boy-hero in case they've missed a story here and there (as I did when they first came out).  &quot;Book Two: Caged Heat&quot; collects a pair of connected miniseries, &quot;WEB OF EVIL&quot; and &quot;THE DEATHSNAKE&quot; (5 issues in all).  The first deals with prejudice in a small town, while the second tackles prison corruption.  There's less supernatural elements here than usual (if you don't count voodoo love-drugs and an apparent return from the grave!) but the intrigues and complex character interactions more than make up for it, and present a scenario that might remind one of an x-rated version of DARK SHADOWS.<br />Blackburn's rather art-deco art style is unlike anything in modern comics, and in fact the only comic-book artist his work reminds me of is Harry G. Peters, the original illustrator of WONDER WOMAN-- whose earliest adventures have been considered &quot;kinky&quot;, but never THIS much!  Blackburn's style has evolved from story to story, and it's almost surprising how much he seems to have matured as an illustrator when you compare his earliest stories to the later ones.<br />Both stories here contain some of the most shocking violence in the series (and that's really saying something), but WEB OF EVIL also features one of THE hottest sex scenes as well, in its 2nd issue when Coley &amp; his friends decide to put on a public &quot;exhibition&quot;.  A surprise for me was one of the hottest pages in the book was actually missing from the original printing!  Hallelujah for &quot;remastered&quot; editions!  Not for the faint of heart-- and NOT to be forgotten by anyone who reads it!	2001-06-09

A very difficult yet satisfying book to read, this build slowly from utter bleakness to an enthralling sense of wonder.  Having seen the 1961 movie, I was astonished at how LITTLE of the book actually made it to the screen--  and there were NO monsters here!  Ironically, the trained orangutan-butler  that would have been at home in a Disney film was one of the things left  out of the film version.  Having been surprised that the book 20,000  LEAGUES actually left Captain Nemo's background a total mystery right to  the end, Verne finally reveals his true identity here-- and one can tell  nobody in Hollywood's been reading this book.  While it basically stands on  its own, Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is actually a sequel to 2 previous  books:  20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and the more obscure CAPTAIN GRANT'S  CHILDREN, the latter of which I believe served as the inspiration for the  Disney film IN SEARCH OF THE CASTAWAYS!  With Verne's interest in minute  detail, I came away feeling this book could serve as not only a rousing  adventure story, but as a wonderful manual for anyone wanting to start a  new civilization completely from scratch.	2000-06-28

Seek out if you can, from 1937,  SOLDIER AND THE LADY, starring Anton Walbrook (the hero), Akim Tamiroff  (the villain!) and Ed Brophy (the comic-relief newspaper-reporter).
