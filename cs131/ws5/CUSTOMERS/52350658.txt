Once a Carpathian male &quot;turns&quot; he is a danger to humans and Carpathians alike, a threat that must be eliminated.  Gregori's only hope from such a fate is a young 23 yr. old named Savannah,  his lifemate. She is the daughter of the Prince of their people Mikhail and  his lifemate Raven(their story is told in DARK PRINCE). Independent and  carefree, Savannah at first dreads her fate as lifemate to such a very  possesive, demanding and domineering male who happens to be one of the most  dangerous Carpathians to ever exist. She fears his power especially after  he loses control and almost kills her. She brings him back from the  darkness just in time and becomes his beacon of light. In doing this,  Savannah gets to know her lifemate and learns to understand him. She sees  past the hunter, past the image of the Dark One, and sees a man of  unwavering honor and loyalty who is willing to put her life and the lives  of their people before his own without hesitation.<br />Once these two  lifemates are joined to one another completely, the chemistry between them  is electrifying.

A WHOLE LOT OF LOVE is a beautiful story revolving what modern day society would call an &quot;odd couple&quot;. It's sad but very, very true.<br />You see, Kayla is not your average sexy heroine with a to-die-for body. No, she  is like many of us, beautiful in so many ways but made to feel the opposite  due to her size. Granted many readers may think that a size 14 or 16 isn't  very big, well, for those of us who are that size, it's definely a big  deal. I for one range between 14-16 and it's definitely been a problem not  only socially but emotionally. But I must say, after reading this wonderful  story, I felt truly blessed. I was reminded that unquestionable love does  indeed exist. That there is that one special person that will see you for  what you are inside and will let that emotion reflect upon how they see you  on the outside. I guess that's why I absolutely adored Ethan. He's every  woman's dream come true. And you know what? He's really out there just  waiting for YOU to see inside of HIM.<br />I cannot express enough the joy I  felt after reading this book.

In LADY BE GOOD, we meet Lady Emma Wells-Finch, a woman trying desperately to disillusion a wicked Duke intent on marrying her. She comes to America hoping to tarnish her &quot;good girl&quot; image. Her friend Francy  recommends her friend Jake Traveler to show the sights of Texas. Jake  Traveler, a champion golfer recently suspended from the sport by Francy's  husband Dally, agrees to show Emma around only because Francy promises to  see if she can convince her husband into ending his suspension. When Emma  and Jake meet, their attraction is wickedly erotic. Unfortunately, they can  barely stand each other's presence most of the time. But soon enough, the  love-hate relationship evolves into a flaming romance. <br />Jake and Emma are  two of the most stubborn people you'll ever meet. They are outrageously  hilarious at times in their struggle to figure out what they want from one  another. Jake's sister is delightful aswell as she tries to hopelessly  avoid the man that wants her. It was great to see how Francy and Dally, the  beloved main characters of FANCY PANTS, were doing. I loved their son Ted  and was thrilled to know that their once &quot;ugly duckling&quot;  tranformed into a gorgeous hunk. I would love to see a story based on him.  <br />All in all, LADY BE GOOD is a wonderful story filled with  misunderstandings, war between the sexes, humor, and most definitely  passionate love. I recommend it. You'll enjoy it. Trust me!	1999-04-27

In order for me to read science fiction, the storyline has to grab me. Well, this book definitely grabbed my attention. In the TRAITOR'S SUN, Regis Hastur has  passed away, leaving Mikhail Hastur, his heir, as the new regent of  Darkover. Mikhail must once again face opposition from some of the members  of the domains and go against a new threat from the Terran Federation. We  learn about other characters aswell, especially about Marguerida and  Mikhail's oldest son, Domenic. Because I wanted to learn more about the  Darkover series, I also purchased the two books before this one, EXILE'S  SONG which took place fifteen years earlier and introduced us to an adult  Marguerida Alton and Mikhail Hastur and THE SHADOW MATRIX in which  Marguerida and Mikhail go back in time and Mikhail inherits a great power.  These are also fantastic books. I cannot wait for the next addition to this  amazing saga. <br />TRAITOR'S SUN is filled with sci-fi action and with enough  of a romantic twist to keep you enthralled. I recommend this book and it's  predecessors. You'll love it. Trust me!	1999-04-15

He is a night  drifter.<br />This story mainly focuses on the older twin, Lance and on his  chosen bride, Rosalind Carlyon. Rosalind, a young widow not afraid of the  St. Ledger legacy, is the only one capable of bringing peace to Lance's  restless soul. He is her knight in shining armor while she is his Lady of  the Lake. They are a passionate couple.  The relationship between the  brothers is at times heartwrenching especially when the love between them  is so evident. I also found the friendship between Lance and Rafe Mortmain  intriguing. I thought Effie Fitzleger, the current bride finder, was  hilarious and definitely not the expected. The cameos of Anatole and  Madeline were fantastic. Their love is still as passionate as ever.  Prospero, the family originator and ghost, was as mysterious and dashing as  ever. It was wonderful to finally get to know more about him, his past and  his St. Ledger power, which happens to be very similar to Lance's. <br />THE  NIGHT DRIFTER is a story filled with magic, mystery, suspense, tragedy,  healing, love and passion.

Finally, we have the story we've all been waiting for, that of Daniel and Anna MacGregor. From start to finish, I was absolutely enthralled. I couldn't put it down. We can definitely see where the rest of the  MacGregors get their stubborn pride, dignity, will to succeed, and their  passion. Daniel and Anna were as amazing then as they are now. It was a  little weird for me to picture Daniel so young, but if you really think  about it, he's never really aged, not mentally or emotionally. He's still  as caring, daring, stubborn and pigheaded as he ever was. Anna is still the  strong and willful woman that she was so long ago when she was determined  to become a doctor. They are a fantastic couple deserving of their places  as heads of the MacGregor clan. Also included in this book is the story of  Ian MacGregor dating back to, what I believe to be, the time of the Boston  Tea Party. It appears to be the beginning of the storytelling of the  MacGregors of the old. The next tale is to be about Ian's aunt, Serena. I  can't wait!

She and Richard  have been acquaintances for many years, but Paris has just recently become  aware of Richard as a man, a very sexy and handsome man, a man who is  obviously aware of her.

Not so with FRENCH QUARTER. This is a fabulous book telling the love story of Jack Charbonnet and Celena Payne. Their story is  filled with murder, suspense, humor, and a passionate love. Both characters  grow throughout the book, learning to trust and depend on one another.  Jack's daughter Amelia is a wonderful little girl whose rare adult  intelligence is amazing. Other characters such as Dwayne, whose humor is  absolutely comical, and Celina's brother, Cyrus, a sexy priest, are also  intriguing additions to the story. This is a wonderful read.

I absolutely loved Rachel and Gabe. Their relationship was a roller coaster of a ride. Gabe's tragedy was heart breaking and Rachel's struggle to overcome the prejudice caused by her dead  husband's betrayal of a town was valiant and admirable. Her son Edward's  need for a stable home and a father was heart wrenching. It was wonderful  to see them accept the unevitable love that had developed and finally  become a family. It was also wonderful having the other characters in the  book grow and heal. Kristy's wish finally comes true when Ethan, her  employer, a minister and Gabe's brother, finally realizes his love for her.  Their scenes were hilarious and touching. Cal, Gabe's older brother, his  wife Jane, and their baby daughter Rosie, were also fun to get to know.  This book is definitely worth your time and money. You'll love it. Trust  me!	1999-02-10

I felt that certain scenes dragged which left me bored and turning pages without reading them. The chemistry between Lance and Britt could have been more explosive. There was something  always exploding or catching fire in this book, too bad it wasn't them. And  then, when a relationship between them is finally established, in the end  they part and go their separate ways. I really felt cheated.

It lacked what was needed in  order for me to get a better feel of the characters and their love. I felt  as if the book was on fast forward,something that I intensely dislike in a  story.

But Kelsey is not what she seems to be, she is really a woman of  gentry unfortunately forced to sell herself in order to save her family.  Though wary at first, Kelsey soon learns that Derek is not only handsome  but kind and loving. Of course, the unavoidable happens, they fall in love.  Unfortunately, their situation does not, in society's eye, permit them to  marry, but this is not the only problem Derek faces. He not only finds out  that Molly Fletcher, a maid in his father's household, has been his  father's mistress for many years, but that she is the mother he was told  was dead. Talk about a whopper! I absolutely loved the conflicts and the  struggles Derek and Kelsey faced. I was swept away by Jason and Molly's  unshakable love that has lasted so very long. The pain and the sense of  betrayal that Derek feels and the love and self-sacrifice of Molly and  Jason would bring anyone to tears. Anthony and James never seem to  disappoint us. They are wonderfully wicked especially when they try to  provoke Nicholas- Regina's husband and Warren- Amy's husband also James's  brother-inlaw. Those four are fantastic.

The present turns out  to be a journal, written by Christopher and Anastasia Mallory, telling the  current Mallorys of their struggle against society's laws. Anastasia  Mallory was most definitely a gypsy and therefor not in Christopher's  class. But against all odds, their love brought them together and made them  one. Their story inspires the other Mallorys especially Jason. He's been  trying to convince Molly into marrying him but she keeps refusing, not  wanting to bring scandal to his name. But thanks to the present, he finally  gets her to accept his proposal which brings joy to their son, Derek and  surprise yet congratulations from his brothers.

It broke my heart when  he realized that Lily had betrayed him nearly causing his death. I  understand Lily's anger toward the Sharpe gang. When she was only 12 yrs.  old, her parents were killed by the gang. She was then &quot;adopted&quot;  by them, taught to be an outlaw herself. Before her mother died in her  arms, Lily promised her that she would do anything to survive. She did. But  what I couldn't understand, was her coldness towards Texas, her husband.

He overcame the loss of an eye and the scarring of the left side of his body thanks to the letters that his dead friend Richard's wife  sent to him. Richard Stroud was killed in the same bombing where Trevor was  nearly killed in. He accidentally comes into possession of Richard's  letters sent to him by his wife. He finds comfort in reading them. Her  letters help him with his recovery. It takes him over a year to recover  from his injuries. He decides to make a new start for himself. Where does  he go? Texas. Why Texas? Because that is where he'll find Kyla Stroud,  Richard's widow. Kyla, who is still trying to cope with her husband's  sudden death, is hard at work running a business and raising their son.   When Trevor meets her, he doesn't introduce himself as Richard's friend  &quot;Smooch&quot;, his old nickname . Through her letters, Trevor knows  that Kyla thinks &quot;Smooch&quot; is a jerk. Kyla only knows that Trevor  Rule is new to the area and is trying to make a success out of his  construction company. She's immediately attacted to him but is afraid to  love someone other than Richard. That doesn't keep Trevor from trying to  get close.     Will he succeed?  Read the book and find out.  You'll love it almost as much as I did.	1998-11-24

In this installment of the MacGregor saga, we meet three of the MacGregor grandsons, DC, Duncan, and Ian. Talk about hunks! Each grandson meets their perfect bride, thanks to  their softhearted and sneaky grandfather, Daniel MacGregor. We meet Layna,  Catherine Mary &quot;Cat&quot; and Naomi.

I loved BURNT OFFERINGS and was therefor looking forward to the eighth book of the series. I was very dissappointed. The plot wasn't the greatest and too many things were  happening all at once. I am really worried about  Hamilton's next book, OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY, the &quot;Edward book&quot;. I  read that a lot of the usual characters will not be included. I know this  going to affect my opinion. The various and unique characters are such an  essential part in the series that I just can't imagine them not being  involved. I was really dissappointed with  BLUE MOON and so I'm keeping my  fingers crossed for this next one. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic  series. This doesn't reflect on my opinion of the overall series. It's one  of the best I've ever read and recommend it to anyone. I do suggest that  the previous books should be read in order to provide a better  understanding of the series.	1998-10-31

It's hard for her, but she's admitted  to  herself that giving up Jean-Claude isn't a matter of choice anymore. Their  intimacy is so vividly described that I felt goosebumps all over.
