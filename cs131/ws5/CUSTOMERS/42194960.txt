This one and &quot;User Interfaces in VB .NET: Windows Forms and Custom Controls&quot; by  <BR>Mathew Macdonald's from Apress. Both are great books and I recommend both highly.<br />Comparing this book to the one by Macdonald: Macdonald's book is much more manageable than Petzold but still seemed to contain everything I wanted to know about Windows forms. It however skipped over lots of wonderful &quot;side roads&quot; that I found very enjoyable (as I did Petzold's great style-he's one of the best writers in the business).<br />Still, Petzold is more than twice as long as Macdonald and thus  not likely to be a book you will read from cover to cover as I think you might with Macdonald.<br />If you can afford it by all means get both books, if you only want one, then for a more condensed &quot;what you need to know&quot; book get Macdonald, if you want just one book that will then serve also as a reference, get Petzold...	2002-09-21

Troelsen's book (also from Apress) is much better for applications than this book. The book &quot;Coding Techniques for Microsoft VB NET&quot; by John Connell is also a book to consider over this one.  In sum, while there is nothing very wrong with this book, there are just much better books.<br />(Question to O'Reilly - why didn't you just port Liberty's book from C# to VB NET.

Liberty's book  is not only better at teaching C#, it is significantly cheaper *and* covers far more material.

I was asked by a friend to look over some of the beginning VB .NET books to help her choose one. This was one of the ones she showed me. It is so bad as to be scary that a reputable publisher would publish it. The publisher and the author should be ashamed of themselves. This book should be recalled as being hazardous to your future growth as a programmer. Please get another book. (I recommend either the Deitel book (Prentice Hall) or the Wrox &quot;Beginning VB. NET&quot; book by Reynolds.)<br />Now granted I am not a beginner, and so you may think to disregard my review since I am not walking in your shoes. <br />But if you are a beginner to the wonderful world of programming then I hope you believe as I do that the purpose of a beginning book is to teach correct habits about a limited body of material. It does a beginner no good if what you learn has to be thrown away when you move on to more complicated material. And *everything* in this book is total garbage and needs to be thrown away. There is no true VB .NET code in this book. For example, Smiley's treatment of files is laughable, it uses the same antiquated syntax that was used in QuickBasic. There is no treatment of object oriented programming, there is in sum *nothing* in this book worth saving.

I was wondering how the new crop of C# books would compare to the better of the first generation books (Troelsen, Liberty, Gunnerson, Archer) so I have been buying a few of them.  I don't think the big four have much to worry about from this one. Although extremely clearly written I still have to say this book bored me to tears even though I eventually just started skimming it. <br />What it is is an extremely careful introduction to programming and seems to be written to be a textbook on learning programming using C#. It therefore takes hundreds of pages to get anywhere, since it assumes you don't even know what a loop is! (There is almost nothing in this book that is .NET specific.)<br />Still, if you need an introduction to programming using C# that starts with things like what is a loop and therefore doesn't get very far into .NET, you can't beat this book.	2001-12-30

This means he cares way too much about  Windows forms stuff and also only gets to objects later on in the book. <br />Windows forms are the smallest part of.NET and it is the full object orientation of VB .NET that you need to master as well as cool things like multithreading, web services and ADO.NET which are skimped in my opinion. <br />An example of the kind of problem that made me give this book such a low rating is the author makes some fundamental mistakes in his explanations of how object oriented programming works. For example, in his discussion of the pass by value/pass by reference distinction he says arrays and other objects are passed by reference even if you use pass by value. This is WRONG and why it is wrong is explained clearly in the excellent books of Roman, Cornell or Jesse Liberty all of which I recommended previously. (Jesse's great book is on C# but it is the same in VB NET as in C#. The idea is that when you pass objects by value you can change things like array entries but this doesn't mean they are passed by reference since you can't swap two arrays that are passed by value as Liberty pointed out)	2001-12-30

(Interestingly enough, Jesse Liberty my other favorite writer on programming, has written a great C# book.) There is no question in my mind that this book currently is by far the best place to learn VB .NET if you have any programming experience at all. <br />Note however that Cornell's book isn't comprehensive and it doesn't cover nearly as many topics as Wrox's &quot;Professional VB .NET.&quot; so you might want to get a copy of that book for now.<br />But what Cornell covers he generally covers in a far better manner and in much more detail than the Wrox book. (As I said in a previous review I found the Wrox book too variable from chapter to chapter to be ideal.) In particular, Cornell's chapters on OOP (especially the Inheritance and Interface chapter) are among the best I have ever seen on these topics. This is also the first book on VB .NET that I have seen that really covers multi-threading in any depth and I was happy to see that the chapter on Windows Forms covers basic printing! (A pet peeve of mine...). <br />However, the downside to Corenll's book is that the chapters on ADO .NET and ASP .NET are only brief surveys and you pretty much have to (but you should anyway) turn to the excellent books &quot;Teach Yourself ASP .NET in 21 Days&quot; (Payne, Sams) and &quot;Database Programming with VB NET&quot; (Thomsen, Apress) for more information on these topics.	2001-10-14

I debated giving this 1* which I have never done before on a review. It really is a totally overpriced incohesive mess of random chapters. <br />But first off just in case you were thinking like I was what it isn't is a detailed discussion of the .NET framework, namespace by namespace (which is what I originally thought it would be). <br />What it is seems to consist of leftover chapters that didn't make it into the other two Wrox books: Professional VB .NET and Professional C# or were already there in other forms. <br />There is yet another chapter on what is .NET?, a chapter on migrating to VB NET that is better done in Professional VB NET and much better done in Appleman's book, there is yet another chapter on ADO .NET, yet another discussion of versioning. <br />To be blunt: everything in here is pretty much done as well or better in the other two Wrox books I mentioned and most of these topics are in fact done so much better in such books as Archer, Liberty, Troelsen, Appleman and Cornell (depending on the topic). <br />I don't know what has gotten into Wrox lately but I wish they would just go back to the days of old when they had single author books and were the best.	2001-10-13

I bought both books and am glad I did.<br />Gunnerson is very clear at what is good C# style and what is not and why you should choose one idiom rather than another. Also, unlike Liberty's book, Gunnerson leads you through the process involved in developing (including adding multithreading) a serious application where Liberty's samples are much smaller and much less interesting. <br />The downside is the order Gunnerson chose for his topics is strange whereas Liberty 's order is much more straightforward and traditional and I think easier to understand. Note that people coming from a VB background will have an even harder time with Gunnerson than Liberty. (People with this background should probably choose Archer's Inside C# book from Microsoft Press.)<br />Summing up: Buy both books if you can, if not buy Liberty's book for a pure tutorial and buy Gunnerson to learn C# style plus how to develop a serious multithreaded application.	2001-09-03

Don't get me wrong, this book isn't so much bad as just not very good. Topics that I expect to be in a professional level book (like printing) aren't there and often chapters stop just when they could have gotten to the professional level (the chapter on multithreading is a good example of this, no real  discussion of deadlock or race conditions).  I would actually say as a result of this the level of this book is actually beginner+ and not professional! <br />I do believe this could have been a great book if it had another 3 months of development behind it, and I would be willing to bet the second edition of this book will be great and Wrox will recapture it's old glory. But, as of now this book is just half baked. <br />(I also found the order of this book very strange, the core programming chapters on OOP are introduced in the middle?)	2001-09-03
