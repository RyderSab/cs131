The main goal is improvement of quality of present life. The author presents a lot of situations from her life. One deals with how her recollection about an earlier life in which she died (as a male) in a cave because of earthquake, helps her to resolve her fear of closed spaces in the present life. The important point is that she verifies from historical records about the actual occurence of an earthquake associated with the time and place. Her girl child always insist on some packing of eatable even for any mudane visit outside home. By regression, she identifies that she has died in a desert in a earlier life. This insight helps her to be compassionate to her child. The issue is not whether one believes in past lifes or not; one can check oneself whether such regression helps one's present life. In case of many phobias, addictions , unreasonable emotinal behaviours, she suggests that past life regression can give understanding and cure. In support of her stand, she presents many case studies. Her discussion on the issue of suicide is very enlighting.  Over all the meaning of the approach is spiritual.	2001-02-13

The plot is  a set of classroom discussions by a management professor, who is unsure of his tenure. ( In the family angle, he has his wife who overspends, with no possibility for having a kid , in a traditional way).   The effect of theory of constraints is revisited through other professor. Later, our hero starts to apply this in his class room discussion. The key idea is to recognise how each step in a project is given extra safety by concerned person. The buffers are moved to a creat a common project buffer. Instead of looking at time aspect only, the issue of critical resource is given attention. ( Like bottleneck in production case). After a  lot of discussions, he is led to discover the abstraction of critical chain ( rather than critical path) as the basis of project management.

The sample chapter titles are : The Rejection of Logical Atomism , Meaning  and Understanding,... The  First Person, .. The Nature of Philosophy,  Ethics,Life and Faith. A good index is provided. Two weaknesses are : The  author provides a two-page introduction. A 10 page biography would have  been proper . Also a last chapter which summaries the nature of  Wittgenstein's works and its relation to other philosophical works would  have been better. From the point of view of Wittgenstein's scholars, the  remarks are provided without any citation numbering. It complicates  refering the book. Same sample Wittgenstein's remarks: The Wolrd is the  totality of facts, not of things. Not how the world is mystical, but that  it is. For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity.  And this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely  disappear.

The book clearly explains the subject matter of Bhagavad-gita (BG), the purpose of BG, the spirit of approach to BG, the process of understanding  BG and the result of understanding BG. The book's main observation is that  BG itself mentiones that BG is approached in a devotional mood to  understand its message. The message is hidden for one without devotion. The  purpose of BG is to make man understand the cause of suffering and method  of release from suffering. One should appreciate how Arjuna accepted  Krishna as Supreme Personality of Godhead. The verses of chapter 10 are  drawn attention. The subject matter of BG is five: ISVARA (God), JIVA (  Living Entity), PRAKRTI ( Material Nature), KALA (Time) and KARMA (  Activity). The process of understanding involves in accepting Gita as  Scripture. The essence of understanding BG is to surrender to God and act  according to His will. One's life is purified and he returns to the Kingdom  of God. The Supreme Lord is transcendental and eternal. Jiva is also  eternal and spiritual. BG reawakens Jiva to this relation. The Svarupa of  JIVA is Krishna-das ( Servant to God). True happiness for Jiva is serving  God. One should worship only the Supreme not the demigods. One who thinks  of Krishna at the time of death goes back to Krishna' s abode. By studying  Vedic literature, one's thinking can be purified. One should practice  Krishna-consciousness all the twenty four hours. There are nine processes  of devotional services ( Listening to Krishna-Katha, Singing His glory,  Remembering His Glory...). The process should be learnt from an authority  (Guru in parampara).	2000-05-18

The author points out that each one has a hole in his (spiritual) heart and only Christ can fix it. The book develops the confirming the hole, Measuring the hole, Engaging it, Filling it, and Fixing the Hole in your soul. For someone exposed to mathematics, it is like proving the existence, finding the actual value and then operating on it. One of the main observation is that modern man follow surrogate religions like sports, entertainment, people, shopping or work and he is not aware of it. Modern philosophically inspired movements are identified as spurious religions. He also shows the incompleteness of standard religions and private religion.  He also specially deals with the questions of skeptic about resurrection of Jesus. The book is written with a good understanding of the background of a common educated man(woman).	2000-04-13

The authors are part of ISKCON movement. The book should interest any one concerned about environmental crisis even if  he is not interested in ISKCON movement. The part one introduces in a  concise manner the nature of crisis in all contexts : water pollution, soil  loss, acid rain etc. The second part discusses the case of meat eating. It  looks at the issue primarily from ecological point of view. Third part is  the key argument of the book. It identifies that all attempts to solve the  crisis based on materialistic perspective, are bound to fail and it  advocates the spiritual approach. It identifies the problem of  sense-gratification as the root cause. Seeking nonmaterial happiness is the  only solution. Fourth chapter identifies that  modern science led to the  crisis. To some extent,  Capra and others have also argued like this. But  this chapter is  weak in detail. The later chapters delve into how ISKCON  can offer the solution to the crisis. Discussions on Bhagavat-Gita is  followed by discussion on karma and meat eating. Last chapter give details  about various rural communities of ISKCON. There are short biographies of  various people working in this direction. The book is well written. The  layout is good. The number of pages is just 95. The book has index and  bibliography.

It is a very interesting variant in Christian preaching. People who are exposed to eastern religions are easily put off by the Christian starting line ` You are born sinner'. It does not make sense to them. The metaphor  of Ramesh Richard is : Your soul has a hole; Only Christ (the doctor) can  fix it. This metaphor is more sensible. The meeting of Christ and the  Samritian Woman has relevance here. Jesus : &quot; But Whosoever drinketh  of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; &quot;. The  important point is that accepting Christ as saviour is to be seen as the  begining of spiritual repair process. That is a start of life-long  pligrimage. The author prefers John's gospel as the right one. The chapters  are arranged in the theme : Pondering the hole in your hole; Confirming  it,Measuring it, Engagaing it, Filling it and Fixing it. The work is  written in a scholarly  mode with a human touch. Modern man miss to  recognise how sports, entertainment, people, shopping or work is a  surrogate religion. There are few interesting puzzles which engage the  reader. A good invitation to the fold of Christ.	2000-03-29

It introduces to user of modren technology ( computer, TV) the basic concepts of quantum mechanics and how it led to various modern technologies. There is no mathematics. But the  book has a lot of interesting figures, which try to address of the  technical issues. The author avoids all the paradoxes and philosophical  issues of qunatum theory. The author introduces basic aspects of atoms. The  author emphasis on the aspect of energy levels of electron shells. This is  key aspect around which he discusses all the technology or its implications  ( like laser, superconductor) or molecular systems. The seventh chapter  deals with the core of computer. Better placing to the chapter whould have  been between 10 &amp; 11. Chpaters on lasers and superconductors are well  written with some example of application, with photos. An photograph of  aerial view of Fermi national Acelerator laboratory is given. There are  such photographs which enhances the appreciation. The author also give a  typical layout of a synchrotron. He does such balancing in his  presentation. One warning: By Qunata, he primarily refers to Max Planck's  concept of discrete energy levels. ( none of the issues  like wave-particle  duality, uncertainty principle). Given this nature of his presentation, 11  th chapter is on Nucleons, quarks, all that. ( It is out of place with the  kind of theme and the level of focus). There is a good glossary. ( The book  is written on 1990). May be a modern version will talk about quantum  computer.	2000-03-27

In the process he is drawn to discuss the cosmology of purna and the standard scholar's attitude to these puranas. He  weakens his case in chapter 6 &amp; 7 by questioning much of modern  astrophysics and the question about moon flight. Appendix 2  is quite  important. Here he explores the question whether Aryabhata borrowed from  Greek traditions to arrive at the planetary positions at the start of Kali  yuga. This part deals with the debate on astronomy transfer among cultures.  I recently drawn attention to his approach to astronomy in Bhagavatam (  including ideas in his paper Exact Science in Srimad Bhagavatam) to an  Indian academic audience who have explord the histroy of kerala astronomy.

It is also a non-fiction on foundations of production management. The author achieves sufficient balance in narration. The basic focus is how to view the bottleneck production centers. He draws  attention to philosophical flaws of traditional management's ( both  production and accounting group) approach to this aspect. He leads to this  analysis by discussing a camp trip of the hero with his son and his  friends. The novel should have stopped with the possibility of hero's  promotion as divisional manager. ( The discussion about theory of  constraints is an essay. Trying to push that discussion spoils the climax  of the novel).	2000-01-10
