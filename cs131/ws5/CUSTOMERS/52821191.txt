The chapters were well written and the material was  explained thoroughly using many graphs to demonstrate the concepts.  Another part of this book that makes it good are the case  studies that deal with the topic of the chapter at hand. If this is the  economic textbook that your professor assigns you to read then don't worry  because this book is straight forward and easy to understand.	2000-05-26

The graphs and charts in the book really help to explain the concept, so that most people can  understand what the authors are attempting to explain.  The chapter  summaries are done well b/c they go over the major points and attempt to  wrap it all up.	2000-05-26

The book did contain real examples (a positive) along with tons of formulas that I'm not sure that I'll ever see again.  The probability stuff was good from this book, but  some of the explanations were lacking clarity.  Some of the topics include:  Finance, linear programming of the simplex method and geometric approach,  graphs, trees, counting, statistics along with relations and functions.	2000-05-26

It was written clearly by stating the points that the author hopes you learn, followed by the reading and then exercises and  problems to make sure the student understood the concepts from the chapter.  The many graphs in this book make the concepts easy to understand and the  fact that most of the graphs are in color helps out alot.	2000-05-26

I had trouble understanding the professor's explanations, so I read this book and the author explained the material better than the professor using different types of graphs,  actual real world items and clear explanations. This is basic macro econ  stuff that speaks about aggregate demand/supply, gdp, functions of money,  banking system, business cycles, unemployment, federal deficit and fiscal  policy.	2000-05-26

This book was very easy to understand.  The concepts were explained, so that even someone, such as myself who has zero  experience in sales could understand what the authors meant.  Most  textbooks contain useless information, but this one had information that I  could use in my life once I graduate from college (example: how to be a  team builder and ways to approach being in sales).	2000-05-20

The bad part was that it was very hard to understand, even when the  professor tried to explain the concepts behind what the authors were saying.  Budgeting was the toughest chapter to understand because it seemed like  each of the 10 concepts in that chapter weren't explained enough for me nor  any of my classmates to understand.	2000-05-20

The good details come from the fact that Anastasia has actual transcripts from the FBI wiretappings of the Philly mob.  Don't make much of an effort to read, unless you really  like the Philly mob.	2000-05-19

Wiseguy is a better street soldier book, but this is good and it is worth reading if you have  some free time.  Always some action going on.	2000-05-19

This book was all about the real guys working in the trenches of a mafia family back in New York.  Great details of what happened, why it happened and how it  happened.  The Lufthansa Heist was interesting to say the least.	2000-05-19

Pistone	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	G man infiltrates the NY mob	Excellent book from a real G man that infiltrated the NY mob and showed how the mob works from the ordinary soldier's point of view.

It's a  very quick read and if you like Grant Hill, then I would suggest you check this out.  If you aren't much of a Grant Hill fan, then  don't purchase this.	2000-05-19

This book is worth reading since this adds some more realism than the movie did.  Another great mafia book by Pileggi and worth the price you paid for it.  Great if you like the Italian mafia and Las Vegas.	2000-05-19

The book wasn't one that made me not want to put it down because it seemed to  focus more on the actual family (son, brother, mother, etc.)  compared to  the mob family in Philly.  If you have  alot of free time, then check this  out, but if you don't, then don't waste your time.	2000-05-19

If you saw Casino (the movie), then check this out because Joe  Pesci plays Spilotro in the movie.	2000-05-18

Very detailed about how Sammy got to be where he ended up and a good read for  fans of the italian mafia.	2000-05-18

If you like Rodman and you want to hear his opinions about fellow players and what the NBA is really like, then check this out.

It starts with Jimmy living in Port Arthur and takes you all the way through to his days with the Cowboys.  The best part  of the book in my opinion was the behind the scenes of the different  colleges he coached at.	2000-05-18

The author went into too much description for some of the games played during the season, which made me a little bored.  There wasn't that  much behind the scenes footage because most of what was said in the book  was said on ESPN on a daily basis.	2000-05-18

Once I began to read the book, it really made me think and the really great part of the book is that it examines each person and the reasons  that they were included in the black book.  If you like the mafia and you love Vegas, then you ought to read this one.	1998-08-04

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the mafia.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat and most the time, I did not want to stop reading it.  There were many interesting stories about the 2 FBI agents that wrote this book and their run-ins with other mafia figures.  It was interesting how they bugged Paul C's house and all the preparation it took.	1998-05-31

I do like Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles, but this book did not pique my interest at all.  There is alot of stuff about God and The Bible when there could  have been more of an inside look at the FSU program.  email if you have any questions.	1998-05-31
