For those restaraunts I found the book was fair in its rating. The food was good and the prices weren't too bad. The only complaint I have about this book is that most of the establishments seem to be clustered in the Chelsea/Knightsbridge area. So if you've been out for a long day of sightseeing you may not find anything in the book in your area. It's the type of book you use to plan a meal ahead of time, and for that it works fine.	2001-09-29

But it's the first time the park has had a female ranger-in-charge and Anna finds her two fellow-rangers scheming to make her job hell. And to make it worse a young girl is murdereed in the park and Anna must find the killer.<br />One thing I've always found that sets Ms. Barr's mysteries apart from others is her writing. Her prose is lyrical. It simply flows. Her characterization is very good along with her dialogue. The plots may be a little unformed but all in all this whole series is good and consistent. I recommend any of the mysteries in this series.	2001-09-29

It all starts out with Alex McKnight playing goalie in the over-30 hockey league where he runs into hotshot player Lonnie Bruckman. Bruckman is bad news and when McKnight agrees to shelter Bruckman's ex-girlfriend, McKnight agrees. But the girl goes missing and McKnight goes looking for Bruckman.<br />Very good plot. There are twists and turns as Alex McKnight hunts for the missing girl. Just when it looks like he has a handle on what happened something new occurs that throws his whole theory out the window. McKnight is a good solid character but so are the other people that inhabit McKnight's world. A good solid mystery that you won't be disappointed with.	2001-09-29

In fact he's been missing for nine weeks but since there was no evidence of foul play the police have been treating it as a simple &quot;man who took off&quot; case. However Dr. Purcell's ex-wife isn't convinced and his current wife seems indifferent. But as Kinsey keeps digging she runs afoul of the brothers from hell.<br />Unlike some other reviewers I didn't think this book differed too much from other Kinsey Milhone novels. They are always pretty light and breezy. They never tax you terribly. I persoanlly thought the sub-plot with the two brothers that Kinsey rents office space from might have been more interesting than the main plot, but that's just me. I have to admit that the book kind of ran out of steam the finish and the ending wasn't as satisfying as some. It was clever though. If you like Grafton you'll like this book.	2001-09-19

I never did catch his show when it was on the air (though now I'm watching the syndicated reruns) so it's only recently I've seen how funny this guy really is. <br />The book is just as crazy as the TV show. Jerry Seinfeld has a quirky way of looking at life and the things he comes up with are crazy, yet they make sense. Many times I found myself laughing out loud over his observations. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh.	2001-09-08

Four childhood friends must save the Earth from the deadly plague alien invaders plan to spread through our drinking water. Mr. King takes this premise and runs with it, giving us a novel that resembles some of his earlier work such as It and The Tommyknockers. At times this book is riveting, just as some of his very early stories like Salems Lot and The Dead Zone were. At times it is bloated and boring. The chase that dominates the middle of the book drags on and on and on. And the ending, at least for me, was not easily understandable. The way in which the alien was bested left me disappointed. I've felt for a while that many of King's later works really need a good editing. Read Salem's Lot for a good, tight, scary story.<br /> And yet, and yet.... No one can draw me into a story like Stephen King. Even with my complaints I'd rather read him than almost anyone else. And it was good to see him writing good old fashioned horror again, the kind that grabs you by the throat and makes you afraid to turn off the lights. Perhaps not as good as Salem's Lot (but then, what is?) but still a good read.	2001-09-08

There are many surprises here. For instance, we've always been told that sucessive generations have been getting physically larger. However the average Englishman in 1000AD had much the same stature that we have today. It was only later as more people moved to cities and malnutrition became rampant that physical size declined. Another fact. The month of July was considered &quot;The Hungry Gap&quot;. This was so because the first harvest in July was for hay and not grains. So while food was readily available for the livestock, grains wouldn't be harvested until August and by July grainaries and barns were becoming empty. I found this book fascinating. Life was very differnt a thousand years ago but you'll find many of the things you thought you knew about medieval man are simply not true. I recommend this book.	2001-08-27

Toward the end of his life he embraced spiritualisim as he did everything else, wholeheartedly, and this led to many people dismissing him as a crackpot. However, as author Daniel Stashower pointst out, such was not the case. Conan-Doyle really believed in life after death. This belief filled the void in his life that was left when he renounced his belief in the Catholic Church. Daniel Stashower has written an even-handed fair biography of Conan-Doyle. The book is well researched and Conan-Doyle comes to life on these pages. Conan-Doyle, of course, is best known for creating Sherlock Holmes but as Stashower shows Conan-Doyle wrote many more works of fiction and non-fiction in his long career. If you want to have an idea of what made the man behind Sherlock Holmes tick then I recommend this book highly.	2001-08-27

As a boy he'd had an otherworldly experience in the old Marsten House and it has haunted him ever since. He hopes by going back to 'Salem's Lot he can exorcise his demons and create another bestselling novel at the same time. But when he returns he finds that the Marsten house has just been purchased by two strange men, one of whom is never seen in the daylight. And then strange, evil things begin to happen. I've just finished reading this novel for the third or fourth time since it was first published in 1975. It is one of my favorite books and one I find that wears well. This was Mr. King's second book and he was just beginning to hit his stride as a writer. His prose is as good as any modern writer, a fact often overlooked because of what he writes. The characterizations ring true as does the dialog. And it is a plain scary classic vampire story. I recommend it highly.	2001-08-25

It's a delight to look at with its wealth of photographs but it also contains solid travel information. For instance: 1) Neighborhood walks through areas such as Chelsea, Whitehall and Westminster 2) A self-guided tour of Westminster Abby. 3) Where to find the most interesting exhibits in the Victoria and Albert Museaum. 4) A great series of street finder maps. Though not quite as comprehensize as the London A to Z series the maps in this book are very good. Much better than other guidebooks I've seen. 5) A great tube map. You need this map to get around the London tube system. I carried my book all over London last week and saw many other people with the same book in their hands in not only the English version but also French, Hebrew, and Japanese. It is an excellent book and I recommend it highly.	2001-08-25

And there's more as Mr. Parker brings together a bunch of previous tough guys from Spenser's other novels. Tedy Sapp is here, along with Chollo, Bobby Horse, Vinnie, Bernard J.

Though a simple premise, it is a difficult task. Setting out from New York Harbor with his friend, Pilotus, Least Heat-Moon journeys ever westward using canals, lakes, and rivers. And as he travels he records his thoughts on many subjects from pollution to politics. As with his first book, Blue Highways, Least Heat-Moon also records his conversations with the people he meets along the way.   <br />The book is thought-provoking and entertaining. I think it calls to all of us who have dreamed of taking our own voyage of discovery. I'd recommend this and his first book, Blue Highways.	2001-07-29

Joe Gunther is asked to help the police chief of nearby Bellows Falls investigate a sexual harrassment complaint against one of his officers by Jan Bouch. However Gunther quickly realizes that there is more to the whole thing than simple sexual harrassment when he meets Jan's con-man husband, Norm. Does Norm really run drugs as the Bellows Falls police believe and is he behind the disappearance of known drug seller Jasper Morgan?<br />As with all of Mr. Mayor's books the plot seems simple to begin with but as Joe Gunther peels away layer after layer we finally realize just how convoluted the whole thing is. I'm always amazed at how Mr. Mayor is able to tie it all up neatly at the end, but he does. And it always makes sense when he's finished. As always Mr. Mayor's characters are dead on. And he really seems to know what makes a small police department tick. All of the Joe Gunther books are just flat-out entertaining. These stand head-and-shoulders above much of the garbage that passes for mysteries these days. I recommend all of Mr. Mayor's books highly.	2001-07-29

Joe Gunther to look at. The nest has strands of human hair plaited throughout. Not too unusual however there are patches of scalp still attached to the hair which leads Gunther to believe there's been a homicide. Other seemingly unrelated deaths occur. Strange deaths such as a potential witness to the first homicide dying of rabies. Or a much-disliked older woman being strangled in her nursing-home bed. Are they all related, Gunther wonders, and if so, how. <br />I've enjoyed all of Mr. Mayor's Gunther novels and this was no exception. His plots are convoluted but they all tie together neatly at the end. His characters are very believeable and his ability to place you in snowy Vermont is exceptional. He'll keep you guessing until the end. In a market flooded with mediocre mysteries the Joe Gunther novels stand out. I'd recommend this one and any of the others too.	2001-07-25

This book is one of them.<br />It chronicles the childhood of Homer Hickam, NASA engineer who grew up in the West Virginia town of Coalwood. Coalwood was a company town, centered around the Coalwood coal mine. In one shape or form everyone who worked in Coalwood worked for or in the mine. Sons were expected to follow in their father's footsteps. However Mr. Hickam and his group of friends are galvanized by the Russian's successful Sputnik launch. They are determined to become rocket scientists and help Werner Von Braun compete with the Russians.<br />This is a book of determination and courage. For instance, Mr Hickam, who couldn't pass basic Algebra taught himself Calculus so he could understand how to build better rockets. But it is also a story of boys growing up during the '50s with all of the normal teen-age angst. Most of all it is a warm book as we watch the Rocket Boys touch every member of the small coal mining community with their striving to reach the stars. I gave this book five stars, a rating I don't give out lightly. I loved this book and I think you will too.	2001-07-19

The south is devastated by its first major loss while there is jubilation in the Union ranks.Could the war be ending soon? But, alas, it was not to be.<br />Mr. Shaara follows three of the war's pivotal figures, Robert E. Lee, U.S. Grant, and Joshual Lawrence Chamberlain as the fighting grinds on.<br />We see how Lee starts to doubt whether the Confederate cause will truly prevail. We grieve with him as he learns of the death of J.E.B Stuart and A.P. Hill and witness the shell of the once proud Pickett.<br />We follow Grant as he begins to grind down the South with his superior numbers. We agonize with him over the deaths at Cold Harbor and Petersburg. We feel his frustration as he tries to keep the Army moving forward and on the attack.<br />Lastly, we see Joshua Chamberlain sustain severe wounds, wounds that are nearly mortal. We're with Chamberlain as he returns to duty appalled by the many deaths. But we're also with him when he realizes he was meant to be a soldier and has never felt more alive than when in combat.<br />Mr. Shaara has crafted a wonderful book that goes beyond the slaughter of the battlefields and into the hearts and minds of its major participants. Yes, it is fiction, but solidly grounded in fact. Perhaps these men come across as excessively noble at times but 19th century man was more noble and less cynical and it is believeable.<br />I recommend this book highly. My only other recommendation would be to read the trilogy from the beginning to get the full benefit of both Mr. Shaara's and his father's writing.	2001-07-14

However, if you're a newbie to Ebay and want to find out what's going on without actually logging on and clicking all of the buttons, then this is a good starting place. Like all \\"Dummies\\" books it covers the basics but doesn't go very deeply into anything. And truthfully, you can learn 98% of what's in this book just by logging onto Ebay and clicking around. Ebay really is pretty easy to use. Oh yes, like most Dummies books they load it down with lame jokes. I just wish they'd leave that ... out.

It comes to light that Jardine, a young stockbroker had a penchant for drugs and sex and he was even carrying on an affair with one of the Brattleboro cop's wives. However, as Gunther gets more deeply into the case he's frustrated by the killer seemingly being able to out-think him no matter what move he makes. Did the Brattleboro cop kill Jardine in a fit of jealousy? If he did, who killed the Brattleboro cop?<br />Good, convoluted plot. Mayor once again delivers with a well thought out mystery that leaves you guessing right until the end. This mystery has plenty of sub-plots and red herrings and I doubt you'll guess the killer's identity before Mr. Mayor wants you to. All in all another good entry into the Gunther series and I recommend it.	2001-07-01

Kidd, master computer hacker, and LuEllen, master burglar are hired by a local action committee to discredit the mayor of a small Mississippi town. The mayor is corrupt, along with the group of selectmen who govern with her and the honest people in town want to take their town back. Kidd and LuEllen swing into action but things go wrong and two of the honest folk are murdered. And then Kidd himself is captured. Will he die in the dreaded vacuum chamber or will LuEllen be able to rescue him before it's too late.<br />The Kidd and LuEllen novels were originally written by John Sandford under his own name, John Camp, and as such pre-date his more successful &quot;Prey&quot; novels. The Kidd novels are just as good if you can overlook the outdated computer technology Kidd uses (that was cutting edge when the novels were written). The writing is great, characterization is right on and the dialog sparkles. As others have suggested read &quot;The Fools Run&quot; first to get a little background on both Kidd and LuEllen. I'd recommend this book.	2001-07-01

When rich Gerald Jacobs dies with no apparent heirs it looks like a case made in heaven for Nick and his partner Alex Moreno. But they soon discover they've got more than they bargained for when the FBI tries to warn them off the case and someone comes gunning for Merchant and Moreno.<br />I enjoyed this first novel by professional heir hunter Chris Larsgaard. It has a clever plot, interesting characters, good dialogue, and a clever ending. I only gave it three stars because the writing isn't quite as polished as some more experienced writers but I'm sure that will come in time.

He's also married to beautiful Andrea Labore who is the premier news anchorwoman of the St. Paul area. One snowy night Rick and Andrea's baby, Dylan, is kidnapped from his second story room, right on the anniversary of the Lindberg kidnapping. Rick and Andrea don't trust the FBI to recover their son so they start their own investigation which leads back to the Lindberg kidnapping and it looks like the same person who was involved then is involved now (and it isn't Bruno Richard Hauptman).<br />I found the whole mish-mash pretty hard to follow. I mean to be involved in both the Lindberg affair (in 1938) and currently would put one pretty near the century mark in age. Give me a break. Many times the book seemed like it wanted to be a fantasy-horror type book what with ghosts helping find the kidnapper. The characters all seemed a little off-kilter and some bordered on the grotesque. And the ending.....well let us just say it wasn't very satisfying.<br />Mr. Thayer needs to work on his writing and his characterization. I gave this book two stars mainly because he stuck with it long enough to create over 400 pages and I'm giving him E for effort. I wasn't impressed with either this book or his other book I've read, &quot;The Weatherman&quot;. There are many better mysteries out there and I'd recommend a pass on this one.	2001-06-15

He's an ex-cop who was shot in the line of duty and almost died. The man who did the shooting, Maximillian Rose,  was caught and is in prison for life. Or so McKnight thinks. However first a bookie is murdered and then another bookie. And McKnight starts getting notes from the killer and the notes sound just like Rose. They mention things that only Rose would know. But no one believes McKnight, least of all of the police, who think that McKnight himself is the killer.<br />I liked this novel. I especially liked the plot. It's believeable and it doesn't depend on the tired serial-killer plot that everyone seems to use today. The dialog is good and the characterization isn't bad. Actually, I was a bit put off by the hero, Alex McKnight. He's angry throughout the whole book, always losing his temper with everyone. Not a very likeable guy. Anger seems to be device that many new novelists fall back on because they think it builds tension and it's an easy emotion to write about. I mean, everyone knows what anger feels like. However Mr. Hamilton overuses it and I hope he tones it down in later books. <br />Other than that, the book is good. A good solid mystery with a very good ending. Mr. Hamilton plays fair with his readers and when the killer is unmasked you can go back and look at the clues and say, &quot;Yep, this works.&quot; I'd recommend this book. I intend to keep an eye out for the next book from Mr. Hamilton.	2001-06-11

He's hired by the wealthy Anshiser defense group to destroy a business rival by disrupting the rival's internal computer processes. Kidd recruits LuEllen, burglar par excellenc, and Dace, former investigative reporter to help. Kidd is also helped by the mysterious Bobby who can hack into almost any mainframe. Kidd does his job well and the rival business is on the ropes. But someone takes out Dace and tries to terminate both Kidd and LuEllen. But who's behind the trigger? Is it the destroyed company, the governrment, or perhaps even the Anshiser group itself?<br />This book was written by John Camp (real name of John Sandford) before he branched out to the Prey series. As such its computer technology is dated but the story itself is still entertaining. Kidd and LuEllen are interesting characters and Mr. Sandford is a good writer. The book does gloss over certain areas of how Kidd actually does cause the computer systems to fail but that's only a minor quibble. All in all I found the book entertaining. If you like Mr. Sandford's Prey series I think you'll like this book too.	2001-06-11

His characters are interesting and well drawn. And he really knows his weaponry. I've really enjoyed the Bob Lee Swagger books and would recommend all of them. To really enjoy this series it would probably be best to start with Point of Impact and then read Dirty White Boys and finally this one.

When you read about Chinese laborers hand-drilling holes in solid granite to construct a tunnel and only making six inches of progress a day it does leave you in awe. In those days men truly were men.<br />The big picture revolves around money, of course. It took enormous (for the times) sums of money to keep the laborers laboring and the lines moving. The behind-the-scenes financial moves can be hard to follow and by today's standards most of these men would be considered crooks. Yet the message here is that despite the petty dealings the railroad transformed the American landscape. Prior to its completion it could take six months to a year for someone to travel from New York to San Francisco. After completion it took seven days for the same journey. <br />If you can get beyond the dullness of the financial dealings in this book I don't think you can help but be impressed by what the faceless mass of Chinese and Irish laborers were able to accomplish. I'd recommend this book even with its flaws.	2001-06-03

However Vic swaps threats and racist words with newly incarcarated black flyer Lincoln Scott and Vic is found dead Scott is the prime suspect. It doesn't help that Scott is is only black in the whole camp and has kept to himself shunning the other prisoners. Tommy Hart, self-taught lawyer, is ordered to defend Scott in the ensuing courts martial.<br />My feeling is that while the basic story is a good one it was drawn out way too much. The book is a bloated 546 pages and I found myself skimming some of it. It seemed to take almost 200 pages before it got interesting. <br />I found the characters bordering on the sterotypical. The angry black who wants help from no one, the good Nazi, the bad Nazi, etc. The book has its moments but there is quite a bit of overblown melodrama. I think the book could have benefitted from some tighter editing. <br />All in all I found it to be a three star book. Not bad, but not great either.	2001-06-03

So he was able to give a unique perspective about what really went on behind closed doors. <br />I found the book compelling. Kennedy wrote it in a superb matter-of-fact style which underscored the gravity of the situation. There are no histrionics here, or finger pointing. Everything is concise and to the point. It's a short book so it's a quick read but very interesting nonetheless. I recommend it.	2001-06-01

Orginally we'd booked accomodations at a Best Western but the thought of flying all the way to London and staying in a Best Western just didn't do anything for me. So we bought this book. Through it we found and rented a two bedroom apartment in Chelsea overlooking the Thames. The price was about the same as a upper middle hotel room. Without this book I never would have considered this or even known how to go about it.<br />As the author states this book is not about finding the cheapest but the best value for the money. It also contains many helpful hints on what to bring, what to pack, and just general information about London. I'd recommend it to anyone, especially first timers.	2001-05-25

Shadowy Gogstad Corporation is quietly taking control of all the fresh water on earth. Once they have control they will be able to drive up the prices to the point that only the rich nations of the world will be able to afford water. In the ensuing chaos Gogstad expects to step in and control whole countries, and finally, the world. However, they hadn't counted on running into Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. It begins with a boat race off of San Diego but before the intrepid pair is through (with help from other NUMA personnel) Austin and Zavala will have tracked Gogstad from Mexico to the Amazon River and to the final showdown on Lake Tahoe.<br />This is another slam-bang action novel that Cussler has become famous for. As other reviewers have written, you have to suspend disbelief but once you do it's a fun read. Reminds me of the Saturday matinee cliffhangers of days gone by. If you're already a Dirk Pitt fan you'll like this new series.<br />My only quibble with this new series is why? As far as I can see the adventures and adventurers are identical to the Dirk Pitt novels. Austin and Pitt are completely interchangeable. Why not just write some new Dirk Pitt novels? I imagine the answer to that is that Clive Cussler wants to cut back on writing and yet keep the revenue stream going so he's farmed this series out to Paul Kemprecos. It would have been nice if he would have made the main characters somewhat different though.	2001-05-21

Mystery stories by today's writers and the stories that inspired them. Like most short story collections some are very good, some not so great. &quot;The Wedding Gig&quot; by Stephen King is interesting, &quot;Murder Two&quot; by Joyce Carol Oates not so interesting. A few, like Harlan Ellison's &quot;Tired Old Man&quot; and Benjamin Appel's &quot;Murder of the Frankfurter Man&quot; are thought provoking. As I said, a mixed bag. On the whole I think the good ones outweigh the not-so-good so if you like short fiction you could do worse than this book.	2001-05-16

A dead body is found on the railroad tracks, its head and hands crushed by the locomotive. A young prostitute is found murdered in her home in the poor section of town, her head almost severed from her body. Two seemingly unrelated crimes and yet a powerful Vermont legislator's name keeps popping up whereever Joe Gunther looks. And as Gunther and the Brattleboro police department dig further, more and more suspects and theories emerge. But who's the real killer? And how does this all tie to a toxic dumping scam.<br />Once again Mr. Mayor writes a good, solid small-town police procedural. The characters are all well drawn and they interest you. Mr. Mayor knows his procedure and it all rings true. I've remarked in past reviews of this series that perhaps Brattleboro is too small a venue for so many crimes and Mr. Mayor seems to agree. Joe Gunther will be joining the new Vermont Bureau of Investigation for his next novel. It should open up a great many more possibilities. Anyway, this is a fine book like most of the Joe Gunther novels and I recommend it.	2001-05-16

He's also a teacher beginning at a new school in Atascadero, Ca. In his class he has Trevor McKinney, a somewhat intense loner of a a fourteen-year old. The last major character is Trevor's mother, Arlene. She also has her flaws being a recovering alcoholic. Into this mix Reuben throws a simple yet difficult class assignment. He asks the kids to come up with one idea that is simple enough for one person to implement but that will change the world for the better. Trevor comes up with the idea of &quot;Pay It Forward.&quot; Do good deeds for three different people but instead of having them pay him back they must pay it forward to three more people. The book then follows various people and how they're affected by these simple deeds.<br />I found the book compelling. The writing was clean and the characters were well done. They drew you into the book and kept you reading. The one thing I did like was that this was not treated as some sort of magical idea that immediately transformed everyone it touched. Jerry the junkie remained Jerry the junkie, but he did try to pay it forward. It's a good book, an interesting book, and above all an uplifting book. It may not be great literature but it is certainly worth the time spent reading it.	2001-05-10

Who is the body found face-down in the quarry with all the labels cut out of his clothing. The dead man looks vaguely slavic and he has some cyrillic characters tattooed on his toes, but that's it. As Gunther tries different avenues he finds that suddenly the CIA wants to talk to him about the murder. And when he goes to Washington he's attacked by a knife-weilding assassin. But the final straw is when he's suspended for allegedly stealing a diamond brooch missing from a jewelry store robbery. Joe is convinced that he's been set-up to take him off the case and he goes after the Russian mob on his own.<br />Mr. Mayor is a good writer. His characters and dialog have always struck me as being believable. However I think he's finding that having his protagonist work in the small town of Brattleboro Vermont is becoming a bit too constraining. In this mystery we've got the CIA and the Russian mob. We've got ex-Russian spies fighting for their lives and we've got a mob shootout that almost costs Gunther his life. Perhaps a bit too much to believe for Brattleboro. Not that the mystery itself is bad. I still think that Mayor's novels are many times better than a lot of the junk that passes for mysteries these days. I just think that this particular book doesn't quite measure up to his earlier works.	2001-05-10

This book will help you remedy that. Each President's administration is discussed in a short three or four page essay by a distinguished historian. What really makes this book extra nice is that, like all books from the Doring Kindersley publishing house, it is profusely illustrated with paintings and photographs. It also has little sidebars that give bits of intrigueing information about each president that is not generally known. For instance: Warren G. Harding was so vain about his appearance and had so many clothes that new closets had to be built in the White House to hold them all. Or: Calvin Coolidge had an electrically operated horse (similar to the bull-riding machines you used to see in cowboy bars) that he used to ride while in the White House. <br />As others have noted, the second half of the book tells about each campaign and has the text for each inaugural address. <br />A very good book. I recommend it highly.	2001-05-03

Alex Delaware immediately thinks of Richard Doss, the father of one of Delaware's former patients. It seems that Dr. Death helped Doss' wife commit suicide and Doss hates Dr. Death. But as Delaware and Milo Sturgis dig further small ireggularities start to emerge. Why was Doss' wife found dead in a motel room while all of Dr. Death's other assisted suicides were found in rental vans? Why didn't Dr. Death step forward and claim responsibility for Doss' wife like he did in all of his other assisted suicides? And finally, who is Fusco, the renegade FBI agent who brings details of yet another killer who may have wanted to usurp Dr. Death?<br />Like all Jonathan Kellerman novels this one is well-plotted. Mr. Kellerman knows how to parcel out the clues and he does it honestly. When the murderer is finally revealed you can always go back and see just where it makes sense and how the clues really did point to that particular person, even though they didn't seem to at the time. Kellerman is also good at characterization and to me all of his characters ring true, even the minor ones. I think the only quibble anyone might have is how in real life a psychologist really wouldn't be able to get this involved with a police investigation. But hey, this is fiction. If I can believe a little old lady like Miss Marple can solve mysteries I can certainly go along with Mr. Kellerman. All in all, a good book. Head and shoulders above most of the mysteries being cranked out today. I recommend it highly.	2001-04-30

It seems pretty straight-forward at first with the autopsy showing Pribluda died of a heart attack. However that evening, hours before Renko is due to escort the body back to Moscow, Renko is attacked in his hotel room by an ex-boxer and must kill the man in self-defense. As Renko digs more deeply he becomes involved with a '60's American radical, an Irish gangster, and finally Ofelia Osorio the one seemingly honest Cuban detective on the island. Everything seems to point to an attempt on the life of Fidel Castro with Renko being set up as the one to take the rap.<br />Like all of the other Renko books this one is deftly plotted. However it is the characters that will grab you and draw you on. Renko, the honest detective working against great odds to discover what his friend Pribluda was up to before Pribluda died, and Ofelia the sensual Cuban detective who helps Renko despite her government's official policy to not investigate Pribluda's murder. These, and other lesser characters are well shaped and the whole story is played out against the moon-like landscape of a crumbling Havana. This is a well-written book and I recommend it.	2001-04-25

Vanadium is sure that Cain is a murderer but can't prove it so he tries psychological means to make Cain crack. Vanadium convinces Cain that someone named &quot;Bartholomew&quot; will find him and exact vengence for his dead wife. But Bartholomew is a new-born child prodigy with strange powers. <br />I've complained about Dean Koontz books in the past. Read my review of &quot;False Memory&quot; for an example. At times I've felt that Mr. Koontz's characters have been over-the-top and his prose way too overblown. I don't know what happened with this book but I'm happy to say that many of my complaints have been addressed and eliminated. I found this book compelling. The characters are all interesting and easy to get involved with. Cain, the egotistical sociopath is handled with just the right touch. Though at times Mr. Koontz's prose comes close to being purple he manages to reign himself in and stick to the story. In the past many of Mr. Koontz's crisis scenes went on and on and on but in this book they are pared down and are right on. In fact, the way Cain meets his end is poetic justice but perhaps a little too quick. However that's a minor quibble. I think this book is fully as good as &quot;Watchers&quot; or &quot;Lightning&quot;. I recommend it highly.	2001-04-20

Benjamin Thorpe is also obsessed with sex. The night before he's due to return to LA he goes on the prowl. However things don't work out well and he finds himself beaten, robbed, and thrown into the gutter. But someone comes along to help him and Benjamin Thorpe finds out something about himself. Something that he's suppressed ever since he was seven years old.<br />In part two we meet NY Detective Emma Boyle. Emma is a rape squad detective who's been assigned a rape/murder case of a young prostitute. A prostitute who had dealings with Benjamin Thorpe the same night of the murder. <br />Even though this book is written by the same man, Evan Hunter, he uses both of his writing personas. Part 1 is written in &quot;Evan Hunter&quot; mode, which is more introspective and literary, and Part 2 is written in &quot;Ed McBain&quot; mode which is more nuts-and-bolts police procedural. However in both parts the characterization is vivid, the dialog crisp, and writing well done. Mr. Hunter seems to be exploring sexual obsession lately as can be seen in his books &quot;Criminal Conversations&quot; and &quot;Privileged Conversations&quot; and now this one. I'd like to see him move away from this area since I think he's explored it enough but that doesn't make this book any less good. It's not an 87th Precinct and shouldn't be approached in that light but it is a very good read. I'd recommend it.	2001-04-13

I'd decided to read this book mainly because I wanted to know more about our current Secretary of State. I usually don't care for biographies about figures still living and I fully expected not to finish this one, however Powell's story about his rise from the streets of the Bronx to the White House captivated me. <br />My only quibble was that I found his time spent on Army commands much more fascinating than the time spent in the White House. Powell himself tried throughout his career to remain in command of troops but he kept being pulled back to Washington because of the excellent job he could do. The book may have suffered just a bit from bloat but on the whole I found it an interesting study of a good man.	2001-04-09

And like many novelizations of both plays and screenplays it reads too much like the author took the stage directions and just translated them into prose (Poirot exits stage left while Hastings enters stage right becomes &quot;As Poirot left the room by the garden door, Hastings entered the room by the hall door.&quot;) I usually don't read novelizations for this very reason. It seems that most of these things never delve any deeper than the movie or play. In this case the novel takes place in one room, just a the play did, which is very limiting. On top of that, the mystery is not very mysterious...this plot is has been used before in a previous Christie novel.<br />I'd recommend a pass on this book unless you've read every other Poirot mystery and really hanker for one more.	2001-04-02

Complicating matters is the arch-demon Findo Gask and his cohorts who are out to find the morph too, and destroy him before the magic can be turned to the forces of good.<br />I found this novel to very satisfying. It has good characterization, dialog, and story. Mr. Brooks makes you care about the people in this novel and what happens to them. Mr. Brook's writing is always good, bordering on the literary, and his story rises above much of the fantasy being published today.

This 700 plus page book gives the reader an in-depth account of his life from his early years in Boston until his death at 84 in Philadelphia. The narrative flows well and the author uses a great deal of Franklin's own writings to illustrate different periods of Franklin's life. But what this book does the best, I think, is take you beyond the myth of the man. Like many of our nations founding fathers Franklin has taken on legendary status that make it hard for us to believe he was very much a human being like the rest of us with our same foibles. Rather than diminishing Mr. Franklin it makes him all the more believable. This is truly a good book about a great man.	2001-03-26

She still suffers from the guilt of surviving the bomb blast three years prior that killer her bomb-squad partner and lover, Sugar Boudreaux. However, now she becomes the chief investigator of a bomb-homocide that killed squad member Charlie Riggio. The scary part is, her name was engraved on the metal parts of the bomb. ATF agent, Jack Pell, comes from Washington to help her track down the mysterious bomber, Mr. Red, who's made it his lifes-work to kill as many bomb squad members as he can and to get on the FBI's most-wanted list. However, as Carol digs further she finds differences in the bomb that killed Riggio and all the other bombs Mr. Red has detonated. Is there a copy-cat working out there? And why is ATF agent Jack Pell acting so strangely? And why has Mr. Red targeted her since she isn't even in the bomb squad any more?<br />As other reviewers have said, this book is much more serious than the Elvis Cole novels. It is written in third person viewpoint which allows Mr. Crais to jump around from character to character. As with all of Mr. Crais' books it's well written and the characters are believeable. This is a gritty book, not breezy like the Elvis Cole novels but Mr. Crais carrys it off well. He contiues the more serious tone he started in &quot;LA Requiem&quot; and I think it has allowed him to stretch out as a writer. Demolition Angel is a very good book. The plot is well constructed and full of surprises. You won't be disappointed with this one.	2001-03-18

However strange things begin to happen as he's on his contracts and it turns out he finally discovers that he's now the one who's the target of a hit man.<br />Sounds like a pretty interesting premise, doesn't it? It could have been a good book, but alas, it was not to be. The book truly is boring. Pages and pages of dialog but no story. As I was reading I kept wondering when the story was going to appear. It finally did, sort of, toward the back of the book. I still don't understand the ending. <br />Up until this book, Keller has only appeared in short stories. I know there was another book called &quot;Hit Man&quot; but as most long-time Block readers realized, that book was simply a compilation of all of the previous Keller short stories loosely held together with filler. Maybe Keller doesn't lend himself to a full-length book. This book, &quot;Hit List&quot;, read more like a series of vignettes (which could easily have been short stories) rather than a novel. <br />I've read Lawrence Block for a long time. This book and his previous Burglar book have startling similarities in that they seem to offer nothing but cutesy dialog. Story seems to be lacking. I hope Mr. Block will redeem himself soon by writing a decent story, hopefully a Matthew Scudder novel.	2001-03-13

Thirty three men managed to seal off the forward part of the boat and avoid drowning but they were trapped. Just a few years earlier this would have been a death knell for those men, but one dedicated ex-submarine skipper, Lt. Cmdr Swede Momsen, had just finished perfecting a rescue diving bell for just such an emergency. This was the first time the rescue bell was actually used in an emergency.<br />The story is a gripping one. Thirty three men trapped in the cold, dark ocean while the rescuers up above first have to find the sunken sub and then fight the unstable weather conditions so that the rescue can be affected. The author weaves the story of Swede Momsen's dedication to undersea rescue research in among the chapters dedicated to the rescue itself. The book is well written and exciting. I recommend it.	2001-03-09

Valdez's assignment was to get to the bottom of the cocaine trade in Wheaton, Massachusetts, but the town is owned by the Columbians, including the police force. So Spenser does what he does best. He parks himself in town and asks questions until he annoys enough people and something shakes loose. <br />I read this book years ago and just re-read it. I think it stands up well. I've always liked the Spenser series because of it's dialog between Spenser and Hawk. Actually the dialog between Spenser and whoever he's talking to always crackles. I also like the fact that the story makes sense. Many mystery/crime novels today depend on the serial killer schtick but to me Parker's mysteries are always grounded on something believable. Cocaine trade in Wheaton, Massachusetts? Might seem ridiculous at first but after it's explained it makes perfect sense. It could happen that way and the story that follows also could have happened that way. <br />Anyway, like all of the Spenser series I enjoyed it and recommend it. It's not deep literature but it is a fast enjoyable read.	2001-03-09

I've never seen Jimmy Buffet play and in fact I only vaguely remember his hit song Margaritaville. So I came to this book with no expectations or preconcieved notions.<br />What I found was a well written, contemplative story of a man assessing his life at the half-century mark. The device he uses to do this is the three week trip he spent with his family and friends traveling around the Caribbean via seaplane and commercial air. Since he'd already been to many of these places before it is a celebration of homecoming once again and the renewal of old friendships. Mr. Buffet has certainly led an interesting life and just because he's now past the half-century mark I doubt he'll slow down.<br />I'd recommend this book. It's an interesting travelogue and also a journey through another man's life. Not great literature, perhaps, but easy to read.	2001-03-05

Sunny Randall, Boston PI, is hired by Mary Lou Goddard prominent militant feminist to protect her from a stalker. But then a member of Ms. Goddard's staff is murdered and Mary Lou fires Sunny for cooperating with the police. But Sunny will not be dissuaded and pursues the case anyway.<br />This is the second Sunny Randall mystery and once again I wonder why Mr. Parker is even bothering. It's Spenser all over again, and a pale imitation at that. She sounds like Spenser, she acts like Spenser, she could be Spenser's twin sister. However she doesn't have the rich characterization that Spenser has. Quite frankly, I think Mr. Parker has difficulty writing from a female point of view. If you read Sue Grafton or Janet Evanovich you'll see what I mean. Things that a woman would normally worry about are just not there in the Sunny Randall books. I'm not saying that a man can't write from a woman's viewpoint, however I think Mr. Parker is having problems with it.<br />This particular story itself is almost a non-story. The ending is slap-dash and not very satisfying. And once again, as in the first book, Sunny must use her ex-husband's mob connections to  bail her out of trouble. <br />After the first Sunny Randall came out I swore I wouldn't read another. Well, I did, and I find I still don't like the series. I shudder to think that Mr. Parker is writing a Spenser meets Sunny book but it's bound to happen. There's so much crossover now I guess it's inevitable. My recommendation is if you like Spenser, read Spenser, and don't waste your time on this pale imitation.	2001-03-05

Her life is normal until one day she receives a letter from her father. A letter written 16 years ago but just recently mailed. From a father who disappeared while searching for the lost Anasazi city of Quivera. She convinces her employer that with the letter she too can find the lost city. An expedition is mounted with Nora in the lead but she doesn't reckon with the unrestrained ambition of her boss's daughter who is along on the expedtion and wants all the glory for herself. And to make matters worse the expedition is being stalked by two skinwalkers, Anasazi witches, who will stop at nothing to prevent Quivera from being found.<br />This is another good entry from Preston and Child who specialize in the cliffhanger type of thriller. There are always more and more obstacles thrown in the heroes path, who just manage to overcome them before the next crisis is hurled on their heads. In one way it is formulaic, but Preston and Child carry it off quite well. At times the dialogue seemed a little stilted and the boss's ambitious daughter may have been a little over the top but on the whole the book was enjoyable. If you like cliffhanger thrillers you could do worse than this book.	2001-03-02

When bookscout Bobby Westfall turns up beaten to death in a Denver alley Janeway's first thought is that it's Jackie Newton doing the killing again. Newton just barely beat the rap on a series of similar killings but Janeway is still after the man, but perhaps too zealously. Janeway and Newton eventually tangle, but it costs Janeway his job. Now a civilan, Janeway once again finds himself embroiled in the Westfall case but this time he may be the killer's next target.<br />Mr. Dunning is a fine writer. His characters are well done, the plotting is believable, and his dialog is right on. It's also obvious that he knows about books. I found this mystery to be very well done with the killer's identity a mystery right up until the very end. In today's market of mediocre mysteries this book and Mr. Dunnings &quot;The Bookman's Wake&quot; stand out. I'd recommend them.	2001-02-19

She's given us a first-person narrative of a sociopathic murderer and has actually had us pulling for him to get away with his crimes.<br />Tom Ripley is sent to Europe to persuade an old school friend, Dickie Greenleaf, to return home and work in the family business. However, for the first time in his life Tom gets a taste of the good life and the freedom that money can buy. He comes up with an audacious plan to assume Dickie Greenleaf's life and trust fund. One murder leads to another as Tom scrambles to keep up the deception. But through all of this the reader actually feels sympathy for Tom and wants him to succeed.<br />I recommend this book highly. Ms. Highsmith is a good writer and the way she makes this difficult theme work is nothing short of masterful.	2001-02-15

But what do the strange glyphs and even stranger black obsidian skull mean? And who are the assasins who will stop at nothing to eliminate anyone who has seen these strange writings? Once again Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano are thrust into a mystery that could ultimately lead to the end of the earth as we know it.<br />Like all Dirk Pitt novels this is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a fun read as long as you don't delve too deeply into the whys and wherefores of the story. And to me, that's fine. I always feel that Mr. Cussler has a twinkle in his eye when he spins these yarns. His Pitt and Giordano characters have always been larger than life and almost over the top. Another reviewer mentioned that this is Cussler's formula, and I have to agree. So, take it for what it is. A fun read and not earthshaking literature. The writing is not up to the level of  a James Lee Burke or Stephen Hunter but it entertains and really, what more can you ask for? I've never really understood why these books haven't been made into movies. It seems to me they have all the requisites for a good movie series just like the James Bond movies. In my mind's eye I've always seen a young James Coburn as Dirk Pitt.	2001-02-13

That's why Lou and Daphne Matthews are assigned an assault and robbery case instead of staying with their usual homocides. However this assault has been carried out on a policewoman who's had her neck broken. At first Lou thinks this case ties into a series of assault/robberies that have been committed since the police sickout, but as time goes on he's not so sure. Then he finds that the policewoman was working on an Internal Investigations case just before she was assaulted. And as he pursues this line of reasoning he finds himself first being warned by other police officers and then being assaulted himself.<br />Very good book by Mr. Pearson. As usual his writing, characterization, and dialog are superb. The plot is well constructed and will have you guessing until the end. I can't say enough good things about Mr. Pearson's books, especially his Lou Boldt novels. In a writing world filled with mediocre mysteries Mr. Pearson's books stand out and I recommend them highly.	2001-02-05
US	52644129	R3TKUM069RQ3J9	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Disappointing	ITC Corp. has invented a way, using Quantum Physics, to journey to 14th century France. It's not really a time machine since instead of going back to our past, the characters are actually going back to a past that exists in a parallel universe. I won't try to explain this but from what I understand this concept is part of Quantum theory. Suffice to say that Crichton makes the whole scientific explanation believeable, at least to someone like me who's not versed in Quantum theory. <br />Using this idea, the book starts out strongly. Professor Edward Johnston travels back to 14h century France but becomes marooned there. ITC Corp. mounts a rescue expedition consisting of Johnston's graduate assistants, all who are steeped in the history of Medieval France. Their mission is simple. Go get Johnston and bring him back. They have a total of 37 hours to do this.However, as can be expected, things begin to go wrong from the time they land and they are all in danger of being marooned permantly in the 1300's.<br />Great idea, but the book rapidly deteriorates into a series of cliche cliffhangers as our intrepid historians fight battles, save damsels in distress, and face myriad perils that would make James Bond blanch with fear. Of course, unknown to our heroes, they may not be able to return because the transmission station back in our time has been damaged and will take a great deal of time to repair. So the whole book lurches to a finish that you can see coming for two hundred pages.<br />I expected more from Crichton. I've read all of his novels, most recently &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; and this is the first one I've considered silly. Even &quot;The Lost World&quot; was better than this. Why do more and more very good authors feel they have to write books that read like video games, or screenplays?	2001-01-30

Deitrich comes from big money and thinks nothing of riding roughshod over anyone who gets in the way of what he wants. However, that doesn't work with Billy Bob Holland who stands up to Deitrich and his equally corrupt son. Matters escalate and soon Wilbur Pickett's wife is accused of murder for defending herself against a rapist/killer sent by Earl Dietrich. Why, Billy Bob wonders, is Dietrich going to so much trouble to railroad a poor man into jail? What does Pickett have that Earl Deitrich could possibly want. <br />There are few writers today who can touch James Lee Burke for his use of prose, his characterization and his ear for dialog. I've been a Burke fan since reading Black Cherry Blues years ago and he never disappoints. Though he writes in the mystery genre (check out his Dave Robicheaux series of novels) the writing is literate while being entertaining. His novels are a nice change from all of the ex-cops who are now writing mysteries that, while technically correct, have no heart or soul. I would recommend this, and any James Lee Burke novel, highly.	2001-01-22

When her Uncle Fred doesn't come back from the Grand Union one Friday afternoon her family enlists her help in finding him. What starts out as a seemingly innocuous search for a missing elderly man soon turns into an investigation of a trash hauling company as first one, and then a second employee of the company is murdered. On top of that a homocidal rapist is stalking Stephanie and a bookie named Bunchy is following Stephanie wherever she goes because her Uncle Fred owed him money and he wants to find the old man too.<br />This is my first Janet Evanowich novel and I have to say I did enjoy it. It's written in a funny,breezy style very reminiscent of the Donald Westlake Dortmunder mysteries. Not a nail-biting type of mystery but it's funny to see how Stephanie deals with her slightly crazy Grandmother and her street-wise fellow employee, Lula. I'm from New Jersey myself and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the characters that Stephanie Plum has to deal with. Ms. Evanovich has the whole New Jersey attitude down pat. This is a fun, easy read and I'd recommend it. I'm going to go out and look for the rest of this series.	2001-01-18

As he does, he's contacted by the state of Tennesee to be an execution witness of a man that Spencer arrested twenty years ago. This case opens doors Spencer would have rather remained closed. At the time he was sure he had the right man but twenty years of reflection on the case, and how it might possibly parallel the hundred-and-sixty-four-year old murder case of Frankie Silver have left doubts in Spencer's mind. So much so that he uses his recuperation time to dig further into the death of Frankie Silver hoping to find the answers he seeks.<br />The above summary sounds dry, I know. But so is this book. Not that the premise and the story isn't fascinating in its own right, but at times it reads more like the history book you hated in Junior High. The author jumps back and forth between three time periods, the time of Frankie Silver (early 1800's), the time of Spencer as a young deputy, and the present. The writing style is different for the early period and this is the part that is really drawn out and dry. I will admit I skimmed parts, but I was fascinated enough by the idea to want to see where Ms. McCrumb was going with this. And I will admit I liked the ending very much. <br />Would I recommend this book? Yes, with the reservation that you realize there will be some slow going inside the covers. The Frankie Silver story is fact and is interesting. It is, perhaps, drawn out just a little too much in this book but it is an interesting story.	2001-01-08

Deputy Carl Houseman is the chief investigator but as he digs deeper he becomes more involved in right-wing militia plots and the mysterious &quot;Gabe&quot;. As the case progresses it becomes clear that this is not a simple drug murder after all but something more involved.<br />Mr. Harstad certainly seems to know police procedure and he has an ear for dialog. The writing is good and his characters are believable. However, I had two problems with this book. First, the plot seemed overly convoluted to me. At times I had trouble following what was happening and who it was happening to. Second, the ending left things too up in the air for me. Granted, it's usually that way in real life but in a novel most people want the ending neatly tied up. In this book, it was not. That said, I'd still recommend reading this book, especially if you like police procedurals. I'll have to admit that conspiracy novels are not my real interest and I'm sure that colored the way I felt about the plot. Mr. Harstad is still a good writer and I think I'll give his first book a try.	2001-01-02

And I've always enjoyed whenever Leigh or Leslie Keno give their evaluations. They both seem to really enjoy what they do and they are quite knowledgeable. So it was with anticipation that I picked up this book.<br />I'm happy to say I was not disappointed. Leigh and Leslie Keno have wanted to be antique dealers since they were both 12. They interweave their story of growing up in upstate New York along with stories of furniture masterpieces they've uncovered during their careers. At times the stories are almost like detective stories as they chronicle finding &quot;treasures&quot; in out-of-the-way places. Such as a magnificent Newport-school secretary found in a Parisian west-bank apartment. They then take us behind the scenes at Christies, Sothbys, and the prestiguous New York Winter Antiques Show to show how these mega-million dollar pieces are sold to serious collectors. There is also a fine story about how one woman found a table at a yard-sale for $25.00. After bringing it to the Antiques Roadshow where the brothers appraised it she eventually sold it through Sothbys for half a million dollars.<br />Though I'm not really an antiques collector I really enjoyed reading this book. It's written in a breezy style and the photographs are outstanding. I highly recommend this book.	2000-12-28

The mob owns the police, the judges, and the politicians. Gambling, girls, whatever a man wants is freely available. But a newly elected prosecuting attorny decides to change that. He hires Earl Swagger, newly discharged Medal-of-Honor winner and legendary FBI man D.A. Parker to clean up the town. But Earl Swagger still carries emotional baggage from the war and even further back from his mean drunk of a father. Does Earl have a death wish as he leads ever more violent raids with reckless disregard? And now that the mob is throughly aroused will they bring in outside &quot;hitters&quot; to take Earl and DA Parker down?<br />This is the prequel to a few of Mr. Hunter's books, namely Black Light, A Time to Hunt, and Point of Impact. These other three books chronicle the life of legendary Marine sniper, Bob Swagger. Bob's father, Earl, is touched on briefly in those books but Hot Springs is Earl's own story.<br />Like all of the Stephen Hunter books I've read, this one was fast-paced and gripping. It wasn't quite as techincal as his previous books and there was a little more humor in this one. I didn't find it quite as strong as the Bob Swagger books but it is still a very good read. I'd recommend it highly. The reader may also want to read the Bob Swagger books first, but it really isn't necessary to enjoy this one. Another good book from a very good writer.	2000-12-23

According to this book Joe was the model that Mario Puzo based his Godfather on and Bill was the model for Micheal Corleone. This may be true but who can tell?<br />The book promises a lot, but doesn't deliver. You'd think a book written by a Mafia insider would be chock full of interesting stories, underworld hits, secrets, but it's really not. Mr. Bonanno seems to spend more time telling us how his family was persecuted by the FBI and the dubious justification they use for breaking every law you can think of.<br />He also casually mentions that he knows who really killed JFK, and it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald. He names names but there is no cooberation. I'd have to believe that if this was really true the authorities would have reopened the investigation into the assassination. <br />I didn't find the book very engrossing because Mr. Bonanno distanced himself too much from the narrative. There could have been some exciting stories here, but they're told in such a distant manner that it is as if he's relating things that happened to someone else in the distant past.<br />I was very disappointed in the book. Read it at your own risk.	2000-12-18

Burt Kennedy has directed many famous stars and made many famous Westerns. He may be a great story-teller in person however this does not come through in this book. There are many things he says are funny before relating a particular anecdote, but I can't really remember laughing once during this book. All the stories seemed to fizzle out and the punch-line seemed to leave the anecdote unfinished. You all know the type of thing I mean. Think of the last party you went to that had the guy who couldn't tell a joke to save his life.<br />Mr. Kennedy does give some insight into the business of movie-making, and this is interesting, but not enough so to save this effort. I have to wonder after reading some of the other reviews if we all read the same book....	2000-12-18

Two master snipers, one Russian, the other German, face off in the hell that is the battle of Stalingrad. Vasily Zietsev is a hunter from the Siberian steppes whose marksmanship and woodcraft ability are instrumental in his appointment of head of the Russian sniper troops. In fact his troops are so succesful that the Germans finally call on their master, Heinz Thorvald, to end Zietsev's life. So begins the duel in the rubble of Stalingrad from which only one man will emerge alive.<br />I found this book very well written. The prose is quite lyrical and not what you'd expect from a war story. This novel is not a techno-thriller but deals with the characters and how the siege of Stalingrad has affected them. The sniper duel is almost an afterthought as Mr. Robbins spins his tale of love, death, cowardice and heroisim. Even if you don't like war stories I think you'll find this book entertaining.	2000-12-13

Both Jack and Harry are actually in love with Rachel, but war in Europe looms and the three must part. Rachel, a German Jew, and her parents plan to wait out the war in Istanbul while Harry returns home to the USA and Jack to Germany. However, they're destined to meet in Sakkara again in early 1944 as Jack and Rachel lead a German commando team whose mission is to assassinate Franklin Roosevelt as he meets with Winston Churchill in Egypt. And it's Harry's job to stop them.<br />This book is loosely based on an actual German mission that apparently came very close to succeeding. However the addition of Jack, Rachel, and Harry are pure fiction. And the author has taken liberties with how the mission was actually conducted which is, of course, his perogative. I was bothered by a number of things with this book. First, why is it that the heroes can always take beatings, gunshot wounds, stabbings, etc and it never slows them down. I know, I know, it's fiction. But this sort of thing threatens the versimlitude of the story and makes you leave the author's world. Second, why do the bad guys, whenever they have the good guy at their mercy, always do dumb things. For instance, at the end the evil Major Kleist (a cartoon SS major who's also along on the mission) has the drop and both Harry and Jack (who have joined forces by this time, don't ask). Kleist hates them both, Jack because he's the son of a rich Prussian, Harry because he's the enemy. Kleist relishes their death as he holds a machine pistol on them. One pull of the trigger and our two heroes are both history. However, Kleist has even a better idea. Let's get them into the boat and drop them in the Nile for the crocodiles. Of course this gives Jack and Harry the opportunity they need to escape. Nitpicky? Perhaps. But if the situation is dumb, the author doesn't have to put them into it. There are other waysto do these kind of things. <br />Another example. To find out if Roosevelt is really in the secure compound Harry and Kleist have to crawl through a dirty, dusty tunnel which takes them past the defenses and onto the grounds. They're wearing US Army uniforms. They walk freely about the secure compound and Harry actually gets right next to Roosevelt. Didn't they get dirty from crawling through the tunnel? Even if they weren't recognized for Axis spies the first officer who'd seen them in the dirty uniforms would have stopped them, especially with the President of the US nearby. Once again, details the break the versimlitude of the story. <br />The ending. I won't give you details, but it drags on and on and on. <br />This was my first Glenn Meade book and it will probably be my last.	2000-12-03

That is, until, she gets a letter from Lecter and her bosses give her a reprieve to help catch the elusive mass-murderer. But reclusive millionare Mason Verger, who Lecter crippled and almost killed, is also searching for Lecter. And Mason Verger has serious plans for revenge and won't let Starling or anyone else stand in his way.<br />This book was not what I expected. Not to say that it's a bad book, it's not, but somehow it doesn't fit into what you'd expect a sequel to &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; to be. The writing is good, but quite different from how Mr. Harris normally writes. By that I mean it's almost Victorian. There is great detail in the descriptions which can go on for pages. He also uses the &quot;Dear Reader&quot; voice at times in which he, as the author, talks directly to the reader which is also very Victorian. And I must admit I was disappointed in the ending. To paraphrase Stephen King's comments on this book it's almost more of a horror novel than a thriller.<br />I've rated this book at four stars because the writing is very good. However, I think most people will buy this book expecting to get a &quot;Silence of the Lambs - Part Two&quot; and will be disappointed because it is not.	2000-11-21

However, attractive Alice Cottrel hires Bernie Rhodenbarr to burgle Landau's apartment and retrieve the letters before they can go on the auction block. Of course, when Bernie gets into Landau's apartment the letters are gone and the lady is stone-cold dead.<br />I've read most of the Burglar series, and as many other reviewers have stated, they are meant to be light reading. I've never enjoyed them as much as Block's Matthew Scudder series but they're not bad. The dialog is sometimes a little too cute but I can live with that. What really bothered me about this one is the identity of the killer. Came right out of left field. This, I feel, is very unfair to the reader. I personally feel at the end of the book you should be able to go back and see where it was logical for the person to be the killer. There should have been clues or something that could have pointed to this person. I didn't find that in this book and I felt let down.<br />Block always writes well and his characters are predictably quirky. As I mentioned before, the dialog is too cutesy at times but on the whole it's not too bad. The plot up until the end is really pretty good however I got the feeling that Mr. Block painted himself into a corner and wasn't sure how to bring this to a conclusion and thus the lame ending. Oh well. I'll most likely keep reading the Burglar books but I hope this isn't the start of a trend.	2000-11-17

In this book she gives us all of the trial details from the first time she heard about the killings until the day the jury brought in the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. It's an interesting book in that it gives you insight into how each trial element was handled and the behind-the-scenes planning that has to occur to try someone. <br />However, Ms. Clark never feels the need to attach any of the blame for losing the case to herself. Her biggest scapegoat is Judge Lance Ito. By all accounts he is a weak judge and let the defense get away with more than they should have been allowed to, however I find it hard to believe that there was nothing that she or the DA's office could have done about it. In the book it always seems that things are about to fall apart until she steps in at the last minute and fixes everything. <br />This is the third book I've read about the Simpson trial (and it will be the last). I found Ms. Clark's book much more informative about the trial than Christopher Darden's &quot;In Contempt&quot;. The Darden book was much more of an autobiography and to be honest I wasn't all that interested in his personal life. Thankfully, Ms. Clark keeps her personal life story to a minimum. So, I'd recommend Ms. Clark's book if you want to get an inside look at the prosecution side of the trial. However, if you want a less biased look at the whole thing read Jeffrey Toobin's book, &quot;The Run of His Life.&quot;	2000-11-12

To make matters worse, when the police are searching the house they find another woman's body stuffed into a closet. There is seemingly no connection between the women, except for the possibility of drugs. So Davenport has more suspects than he needs or wants. However some of these suspects are, in turn, murdered and the police are left scratching their heads looking for the connection.<br />As others have noted, the plot is convoluted and you won't guess who the murderer is in this one. I have to think this is mainly because Sandford doesn't play fair with the reader and the murderer literally comes out of left field. So, to me, the ending was somewhat of a letdown. His character, Lucas Davenport, has matured. Yes, he's still involved with beautiful women but it doesn't seem as frenzied to me as it has in other novels. I consider this a plus. It makes Davenport more human. As always, Sandford's writing is very good. The dialog is always crisp, clear, and believeable. His supporting characters are always well drawn, and even though this novel has quite a few of them I found them all likeable. This book may not be as strong as others in the series but it's still a very good mystery. It's head and shoulders above much of the crap that passes for mysteries these days and I'd recommend it.	2000-11-06
US	52644129	R1OHA7J276PQVT	0345396545	798168467	Ilse Witch (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 1)	Books	3	12	14	N	N	First of a Series	A half-dead elf is found floating in the sea of the Blue Divide, his tongue and eyes ripped out. He's carrying a bracelet that proves he's the elf-king's brother who's been missing for thirty years. He's also carrying a map. The map outlines a quest that was started thirty years before and from which no one ever returned...until now. But what does the map mean? Only one man can decipher it, the last Druid, Walker. So begins a new quest to find out what happened to the Elfstones, lost thirty years before and what lies on the mysterious islands shown on the map.<br />Terry Brooks has always been able to paint a rich world of elves, dwarfs, goblins, witches, Druids, and what have you. This new world is no exception. Like all ensemble-type novels there are a lot of characters to keep straight in your mind but they are all different enough so that isn't too much of a task. Since the book is the first in a series a great deal of time is spent leading up to the beginning of the actual quest and in my opinion it does drag a little. However, if you read this type of fiction you have to be aware of that's the way it is written. My only quibble is the cliff-hanger ending. It seems to me the book needn't have ended in such a Saturday-matinee type way. This actually surprised me because Mr. Brook's other series didn't end like this. His other books seemed to resolve a problem within each book and yet still leave room for the sequel to work out the next big thing. I personally don't like this cliff-hanger ending and I think it diminishes the book somewhat. Since we probably won't see the next installment for about a year, that's a long time to be kept hanging. <br />Would I recommend this book? Yes, if you already like fantasy. If this is your first foray into this genre I'd suggest you start with something else. Mr. Brook's &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; would be an excellent place to begin.	2000-11-03

That's the latest problem Jane Whitefield encounters when she has to make Bernie the Elephant and his housekeeper Rita disappear. Bernie has been nicknamed &quot;the Elephant&quot; because of his photographic memory. He knows where a great deal of Mafia money is invested but he's getting older and his memory is starting to falter. Thus, he has to disappear before the Mafia Dons decide he's no longer a help but a liability. Jane figures if all the accounts that Bernie manages are drained off and donated to charity the Mafia will no longer have a reason to look for him. But we're talking close to 14 billion dollars. And to make it worse, the Mafia has found out about Jane and has plastered her picture from one end of the country to the other. <br />I found the premise of this novel intrigueing. Perry handled the whole idea of donating the money to charities in a plausible fashion as well as still keeping the heat turned up on the heroine and her charges. Just when you think they're all home free Mr. Perry throws another monkey wrench into the deal. As usual, Jane is a well drawn character, the plot moves along nicely, and the dialog is believable. Perry, unlike many of today's genre writers, actually puts suspense into the suspense novel. Try this book, I think you'll like it. And then, if you haven't already, find the rest of the Jane Whitefield novels and read them too. You could certainly do a lot worse.	2000-10-27

Jefferson Parker	Merci Rayborn is a homicide investigator for the Orange County Sheriff's department. When she's called out to the murder scene of a young, beautiful call-girl it all seems routine. That is, until she discovers that her boyfriend had dinner with the victim just scant hours before the murder. As she delves further, more and more evidence points to the boyfriend as the killer and she's torn between doing her job and trusting the man who loves her.<br />I've read all of Mr. Parker's novels and this is the first one in which he's brought back a character from another novel. Merci Rayborn was first introduced in The Blue Hour. She seems much different in Red Light, more unsure of herself. However, that's not to her detriment. Like all of Parker's novels his characters are well fleshed out, his dialogue sounds like real people talk, and his police procedure rings true. My only quibble, and it's a small one, is I was able to guess the killer about three-quarters of the way through the book. I have to admit for all the mystery reading I do I'm pretty obtuse when it comes to guessing the killer but this was pretty obvious. It really didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. Mr. Parker is a very good writer, and he just keeps getting better and better. An added bonus for me is that I live in Orange County so I know the areas he talks about in his novels. I might make one suggestion though. To really understand the Merci Rayborn character it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to read &quot;The Blue Hour&quot; first. That too is a very good book.	2000-10-18

Some of them contain nuggets of truth, while some are no more than pretentious garbage. I'm very happy to say that Mr. King's book contains many, many nuggets of truth. In fact, it's one of the few books on writing that I've read that is also entertaining. The book works on two levels.<br />The first level is the pure entertainment aspect. Mr. King gives us snapshots of his early life which he says is &quot;my attempt to show how one writer was formed.&quot; Many of these snapshots are amusing and all of are just plain interesting to read. If the book never went beyond this point it would be a winner.<br />However, the second level is advice on writing. For aspiring writers it is a God-send. He likens his advice to the toolbox carted around by his carpenter grandfather and then his Uncle Orem. He shows what a writer needs to put into this toolbox and how to use it. He then goes on to describe how he works and writes even including a part of a story in rough draft form and then in second-draft with the edits marked. However, this is not a pedantic, dry work. Mr. King uses humor throughout. The overall message is that writing is fun, or should be.<br />All in all this is a good read with much helpful information. Whether you want to write, or just want to see how one of the world's most popular novelists goes about it, I recommend this book without reservation.	2000-10-18

However, in order to do so, his wealthy patron insists that he first travel to the English coal-town of Wigan and investigate the disappearance of Reverend John Maypole. Once there he becomes enmeshed with the pit girl, Rose, and the Reverend's fiancee Charlotte as he tries to unravel what really happened to Maypole.<br />The above description really doesn't do this novel justice. The mystery itself is well done but what really makes this book shine is the suberb writing. I've read many of Mr. Smith's books, and enjoyed them all, but he's really outdone himself in this one. Blair is a wonderful character, richly drawn, full of foibles, but very likeable as the engineer who wants nothing more than to leave Wigan and return to his beloved Africa. Mr. Smith also has a sharp ear for dialog and it truly is realistic. He also paints a wonderful picture of what life was like in a 19th century coal-town. I give this book a 5 star rating, which I don't give out lightly. Don't miss this one.	2000-10-14
US	52644129	R235KPR18X217B	0553579134	53360710	First Evidence	Books	2	7	8	N	N	Blend of Sci-fi and mystery	Colin Cellars, forensic detective for the Oregon State Police, is called out to a &quot;shots-fired&quot; crime scene. It turns out that the body belongs to a friend he hasn't seen in 15 years but the crime scene itself makes no sense. Complications mount as the body disappears, evidence is lost, deputy sheriffs go missing, and Colin is being stalked by shadowy beings. However, when Cellar's long-lost love is kidnapped Cellars must find a way to free her while protecting both of them from the beings who mean to kill them.<br />Great plot. The idea itself is very clever and it's certainly clear that Mr. Goddard knows crime scenes and evidence collection. However, what was missing for me was good writing. I felt the characters are never developed and remain cardboard with a few becoming stereotypes. The dialog is very stilted and doesn't ring true and interactions between the characters always seem to have them saying &quot;What?&quot; and then having to repeat what was just said. <br />And I absolutely hate it when the main character keeps doing stupid things to advance the plot. He keeps returning to the cabin in the woods, by himself, always when it's getting dark or a storm is brewing, and he keeps getting stalked by the mysterious beings. It's like in the old horror movies when the heroine is alone in the haunted house and she hears a noise in the next room and just HAS to see what made it. <br />Would I recommend this book? With reservations. I did skim a lot but I'll have to admit the plot intrigued me enough to finish it just to see what these creatures would turn out to be. If you like plot-driven novels you might like this. Honestly though, I thought the book didn't live up to its premise. Reading the book jacket I thought it was going to be very interesting how an earthling tracked down an extra-terrestrial killer. Wasn't much like that at all.	2000-10-09

Fadlan is an Arab who's forced to accompany the Vikings as the 13th warrior (there must be 13 warriors to fulfill the quest and one must be a non-Northman). However, as an Arab he comes from a more civilized culture and this serves as a fine device to contrast his civilized ways with the barbarisim of the Northmen. However, by the end of the quest it is Fadlan who has changed.<br />Like all Michael Crichton novels the characters are richly drawn. The story is written as if the author is translating Fadlan's manuscript and is complete with authentic sounding footnotes. I found this worked very well as a storytelling device. It leant great authenticity to the story, even though as Crichton explains in his endnotes, it is really an attempt to show that epic poems such as Beowulf really might have had an underlying basis in fact. But that doesn't mean that this story is boring. Far from it. It's an exciting tale and I recommend this book highly.	2000-10-08
US	52644129	RUWY2REQKAPXJ	0451409116	169225851	Smoke Screen	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Unconventional thriller	The premise behind this book is very good. Capture a Cuban terrorist who arrives in the US, but make it look like something else. The &quot;something else&quot; becomes a hotel robbery that goes bad and the Cuban winds up being taken as a hostage. However, the hotel heist really does go bad and the Cuban escapes, along with ten million dollars in diamonds. Teddy Tedesco, ex-New York cop, must find the terrorist before he releases a deadly air-borne virus at a political convention in New York City.<br />As I said, the premise and the plot are quite good and convoluted. Just when you think you have the whole thing figured out Mr. Patrick throws another monkey wrench into the deal and you're off in another direction. However, I had a hard time finishing this book. Mr.Patrick is a very low-key writer and at times the writing fails to generate the excitement the plot calls for. It's not a bad book, far from it, but it didn't grip me with the same intensity of say a James Lee Burke novel.	2000-10-03

But no clues are forthcoming and he stumbles around until the man who hired him, Walter Clive is found murdered. And then Spenser is taken off the case and sent back to Boston. But, never one to let a client down, even a dead one, Spenser goes back to unravel the who and the why of it with the help of gay bouncer Tedy Sapp.<br />This is not one of the better Spenser novels, but even a mediocre Spenser is better than most of today's mystery fiction. The dialogue, as always, is razor sharp and Parker's supporting characters are as good as ever. Like most Spenser novels this is just plain fun to read. If you like Spenser you'll want to read this one. If you haven't read Spenser before I'd recommend starting with one of the earlier ones like &quot;The Judas Goat&quot; to get a real feel for the character.	2000-09-29

He saw service in Poland, Italy, Russia, and finally in the defense of Berlin. He was finally captured in 1945 by the Russians when Berlin fell and shipped to a Russian concentration camp for four years. This book chronicles the years he spent in combat and as a prisoner of war. He gives real insight into the way the German Army operated and he shows how he changed from idealisim and support for Hitler to growing disillusionment. It is an interesting book from both the standpoint of a combat history and also a social history of what Germany itself went through as the war dragged on. However, I did find myself skimming over certain parts, mainly Knappe's views on what he felt were German justifications for the war. And make no mistake, even though he came to feel Hitler was causing the German people great harm, he did feel that a Germany had valid reasons for invading Poland, France, and Russia. I'd recommend this book for anyone who's fascinated by what really happened in World War II.	2000-09-27

A psychotic, near-vegetable who's been locked up in a maximum security hospital for the last sixteen years. Yet suddenly, the Monster is predicting murders before they occur. Alex Delaware and detective Milo Sturgis must try to unravel a mystery that goes back twenty years or more to the time that Monster wiped out a wealthy family in the small northern community of Treadway. But how does this ancient history tie in to the grisly murders being committed today?<br />I'm a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman and especially of his Alex Delaware series. I've read and enjoyed them all but this one seemed to lack the spark of the others. The premise is great and the book starts out strongly, but I didn't feel it was as captivating as some of his earlier Delaware novels. In fact, the end started to drag a bit.<br />However, all that said, Jonathan Kellerman still is a strong presence in the psychological thriller genre. He can write with authority when he discusses medication side-effects, neuroses, and psychoses since he really is a psychologist himself. All this information may sound boring but it really isn't. It all ties in to the plot and plotting is where he usually excels. I just felt the plot ran out of steam toward the end of the book. Still a good book from a good writer. Head and shoulders above a lot of what passes for mysteries these days.	2000-09-27

However, when his ex-wife, Caren,  finds her present husband is in deep with the Chicago mob she grabs the two million dollar payoff and goes running to Broker for help. On the way, she pairs up with morally-bankrupt reporter Tom James who sees his big chance to grab for the brass ring by murdering Caren, framing her husband, and disappearing with the two million into the FBI Witness Protection Program. But he didn't figure on Phil Broker who would stop at nothing, not even the FBI's Witness Protection Program, to learn the truth behind his ex-wife's death.<br />I've read Chuck Logan from the beginning and he just gets better and better. His writing is strong and his characters stand out. His writing style is very staccato and immediate but the action is exciting and the plot is clever. This thriller is way better than many of today's genre that masquerade as thrillers. I recommend this book highly.	2000-09-21

While living in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, Anna  gets involved in the death of a supposed suicide. A teen-age girl leaps to  her death from the top of Liberty's pedestal. If that's not enough, a few  days later the security guard who tried to stop the girl from jumping dies  the same way in almost the same spot. Before she knows it, Anna is caught  up in a mystery involving a sleazy doctor and Castro look-alike.<br />Like all  Anna Pigeon novels, this moves slowly. It does take quite a while for the  bones of the mystery to appear but Anna Pigeon is such a likeable heroine  and Barr such a good writer that the book never seems to drag. At times,  Barr's stream-of-conciousness style of writing can be hard to follow but  overall the novel is a fun read.	2000-09-15

Could it be that they've got the wrong man behind  bars and the real rapist is still out there ready to strike again?<br />Like  all of Mayor's Gunther novels the police work is believable as are the  characters. The dialog is well done and Mr. Mayor has a way of grounding us  in place in Brattelboro Vermont and shows us how a small town really works.  If you like a good mystery and especially police procedurals this whole  series is good with this book perhaps the pick of the litter.	2000-09-08

Gunther is not a fiery  detective but he is methodical and eventually puts all the pieces together.  I didn't feel that this novel was as strong as &quot;The Skeleton's  Knee&quot; or &quot;Fruits of the Poisonous Tree&quot; but it is still a  good read for mystery lovers.	2000-09-08

And I  think I know why they didn't grab me like the originals do. The originals  were written by a man living in Victorian England while these stories were  all written almost 100 years later by writers trying to interpret Victorian  England. I think that's why the originals ring more true to me. Conan Doyle  had all the little details right at his fingertips because he was living in  the period. Modern writers try but I don't find the little touches needed  to evoke the period. I also found that many writers strained to add those  little deductive touches that Conan Doyle always managed to put in. Some of  the examples of &quot;deduction&quot; were downright silly.<br />That said,  there are a few stories that do come close with &quot;The Adventure of the  Bulgarian Diplomat&quot; being my favorite. If you really like the Conan  Doyle originals you may be disappointed in this collection.	2000-08-20

When a top-secret Siberian installation  must be infiltrated the only one who can do so is one who looks and talks  like a native, and who has enough knowledge to understand what he's going  to see. Johnny Porter is the man chosen for the job.<br />I found this book  very interesting. Johnny Porter is a complex character who never takes  anything for granted. This book leads you through the planning for the  infiltration, the infiltration itself, and the escape. It's meticulously  done from start to finish, and most of it is very believable. But it's not  a dry book by any means. Porter and the other characters come alive in the  book. My only problem was with the big secret that Porter is supposed to  bring out of the installation. It seemed a bit less than earth-shaking.  <br />I'd recommend this book. Davidson is head-and-shoulders above many of  the spy/thriller writers writing today.	2000-08-11

This book is an excellent story of the Martin family and how they came to be guitar manufacturers for the past 133 years. It gives you a brief history of the family and the many guitar styles that have been produced  through the years. The book also touches briefly on the history of guitar  playing in the United States and how the Martin family rose to meet the  challenges of the era of the banjo and the mandolin. The book also contains  many fine photographs illustrating the Martin line from the beginning until  the mid 1990's (when the book was written). <br />The second half of the book  is a reference section that lists each Martin guitar style and gives  information on how to date particular instruments. This is valuable,  especially for collectors since on the early instruments only the cases  were labeled and not the guitars themselves. <br />All in all I found the book  interesting. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is since the book  was published in 1995 Martin has come out with many special run guitars.  Unfortunately they're not covered in this book. If you have even a passing  interest in Martin guitars you'll find this book interesting.	2000-08-01

When most of the family is killed by a bomb he becomes the main suspect in the murder. With almost no means  of support or help Charley must jump bail to clear his name or spend the  rest of his life in jail.<br />As some of the other reviewers have mentioned,  the book was slow-paced. What I found fascinating was the way Charley was  able to survive with almost nothing but his native wit. He has no money, no  one to help him out yet he always manages to find someone who'll lend him a  few dollars, or perhaps give him a free meal so he can continue to struggle  on. The best part was the revelation when the murderer and way the murder  was carried out are revealed. I don't think anyone will guess this one  ahead of time.<br />This is not a slam-bang thriller but the prose is very  good as well as the plot. The characters are a bit sterotypical but if you  can look beyond that I think you'll enjoy this book.	2000-07-27

To uncover the puzzle they must  follow the trial to the frozen north of Archangel with Stalin acolytes and  a Spetznatz hit squad on their tail.<br />This is a very literate book for a  thriller. Robert Harris knows how to write and he knows how to plot. The  action moves along smoothly drawing Kelso ever deeper into the intrigue.  Even though we find out the secret halfway through the book it doesn't take  away from the enjoyment and the ending. I'd recommend this book highly.	2000-07-23

I've enjoyed his &quot;A Maiden's  Grave&quot; as well as the Lincoln Rhyme series. He introduces some a new  set of characters in this book who are well drawn. The plot moves along  well until the end. I won't reveal it, that wouldn't be fair, but it seemed  a bit contrived to me. I don't feel Deaver laid enough groundwork for the  ending, and I also think he intentionally mis-leads the reader in the  beginning of the book in order to make the ending work. This is not fair  play for an author. I've seen this in at least one other of his novels and  I hope he doesn't make it a habit. This isn't a bad book but I don't think  it's as good as &quot;A Maiden's Grave&quot;.	2000-07-15

So, they plan to heist a New York brokerage firm of bearer bonds and sell them to the mob. But the big problem is, where to store the bonds until the  Mafia buys them, and how to keep the mob from silencing them after the  bonds are sold.<br />This is an atypical Westlake book. It's certainly not as  funny as the Dortmunder series but it is clever and entertaining. The way  the two cops solve their problems of safekeeping and getting away from the  mob are clever. I didn't like this as much as other Westlake novels, but  I'd still recommend it.	2000-07-04

So Parker must take cover in an amusement park closed for the winter. But he's seen  going in by a pair of crooked cops and the mob guys who are paying them  off. And the one thing on their mind is to go after Parker and take away  the money and make Parker disappear at the same time.<br />Donald Westlake,  alias Richard Stark, really knows how to spin a tale. The plotting is tight  and the prose is sparse. Parker is a tough man in a fight and it's fun  watching him get out of a situation where he's trapped in a box with no way  out and twenty men hunting him down. A good crime read.	2000-06-29

While on what should have been an easy job he's caught by the pistol-toting homeowner and gets caught. That's bad enough, but the homeowner, wealthy Max Fairbanks, adds insult to injury  when he claims that Dortmunder's lucky ring actually belongs to him. Big  mistake. Dortmunder vows to get the ring back no matter what which leads to  a series of funny capers where Max Fairbanks loses more and more wealth  until the slam-bang finish in Las Vegas.<br />I've been reading the Dortmunder  novels for years and they never disappoint. They are always funny with a  little cockeyed slant to them that Donald Westlake is famous for. They are  just fun books to read and I'd recommend any of them.	2000-06-25

But she has a dream that keeps her going. When that dream is threatened she quickly goes back to her old hot-prowler ways for  the one score that will allow her to disappear and live her dream. But it  falls apart and before long she finds herself pursued by Jack Karch, amoral  trouble-shooter for the Las Vegas syndicate.<br />Michael Connelly is an  excellent writer. This book delves behind the scenes of Vegas casinos  showing both the security measures and how they're circumvented by thieves.  I found this fascinating. But it also shows us the complicated character of  Cassie Black and Jack Karch. Neither are either all good or all bad which  makes them very real. The pace is excellent as is the plot. My only  complaint, and it is a minor one, is at the very end I felt left hanging.  Since Cassie broke the law I was wondering how she was going to get away  with it but the book stops short of supplying the answer. I still recommend  this book highly anyway.	2000-06-25

When one of his old cronys from the Denver PD offer him a quick $5000 for picking up a bail jumper in Seattle Cliff takes the job, mainly because it also involves  a rare copy of Poe's &quot;The Raven.&quot; But all is not as it seems as  Cliff gets drawn deeper and deeper into a forty year old mystery that finds  him being hunted by the Seattle police for murder.<br />John Dunning is a good  writer. His characters are excellently drawn, his dialogue is crisp, and  the plotting is tight. Cliff Janeway has a good &quot;voice&quot; and the  book moves along well, never dull or boring. This is the first Bookman  mystery I've read but I'll be looking for the others. This book stands way  above the average run-of-the-mill books that pass for mysteries these days.  I recommend it highly.	2000-06-14

But Gray hasn't picked up a rifle in ten years and has no desire to. Suddenly, people near Gray are being assasinated and Gray  discovers it's really him the sniper is after. The mysterious sniper is  trying to force Gray into a man-to-man showdown that Gray has no other  choice but to accept.<br />I never really believed in the Owen Gray character.  For an ex-Marine sniper with 96 confirmed kills he just seemed to wimpy to  me. But I could have lived with that. The thing that really destroyed my  belief in this book was the duel. The two snipers get shot, burned, stung  by wasps over 400 times, but just keep trucking along. The author seems to  believe that by piling more and more debilitating wounds on these two that  he's upping the suspense. Actually, all he's doing is making it more  cartoonish until it gets to the point where it's not believable. It's easy  to see that people who write like this have never seen the real affects of  gunshot trauma. <br />My recommendation? Read Stephen Hunter's &quot;Point of  Impact&quot;, &quot;Black Light&quot;, or &quot;The Master Sniper&quot; if  you really want to see how this idea works in the hands of a good writer.	2000-06-07

Requiem (Elvis Cole)	Books	5	106	113	N	Y	An Exceptional Book	As with most of the reviewers, I've followed Robert Crais from the beginning and this is his best book yet.<br />It starts with Joe Pike's ex-girlfriend, Karen Garcia, being gunned down by the Hollywood Reservoir  as she's out jogging. Karen's father, an Hispanic with huge political  clout, doesn't trust the police to work the case so he asks Joe to act as  an overseer to the case, and Joe involves Elvis Cole. As more evidence  surfaces it looks like a serial killer may be at work and when the prime  suspect is himself murdered, Joe Pike is arrested for the killing.<br />First, the plot is very well done. It has the requisite twists and turns  and I don't think many people will figure this one out before the author  wants you to.<br />Secondly, the writing is superb. Crais has always been a  good writer in a mild breezy way, but with this book he shows us he can  handle deeper emotions. This is a darker, more serious, book than his  others and he handles it with aplomb. I, at first considered this series as  a Spenser wannabee, but his writing has now pushed him beyond that. He is a  very good writer.<br />Third, his characterization is rich. Joe Pike, who up  until now has been Elvis Cole's spear carrier, emerges as the complex human  being we've always felt he might be. Far from being the emotionless killer,  we find that Joe's emotions are there but well hidden. The book does a  wonderful job of explaining what made Joe the way he is. Some others have  remarked that Joe is a little too unbelievable, but I don't think so. There  really are men like this in the world.<br />I can't recommend this book highly  enough. I gave it five stars and I don't give out that rating lightly. You  won't be disappointed.	2000-05-29

Louis Kincaid, a black Detroit policeman, returns to his hometown of Black Pool, Mississippi to be with his dying mother. While there he joins the sheriff's department and becomes embroiled in a thirty-year old mystery  when a skeleton with a noose still around its neck is unearthed. As he  delves further he stirs up the white and black communities and his own life  is put in jeopardy before the mystery is finally solved.<br />After reading  most of the previous reviews I'm afraid I'm going to have to take the  minority position. I feel the book's strength is its plot. For a first  mystery, it's well plotted and there are enough plot twists to keep you  interested. However, most of the characters are sterotypes. The evil,  ambitious Mayor, the corrupt DA, the  struggling-to-get-out-from-under-the-evil-mayor sheriff, the cracker  deputies, the tragic southern belle, they're all here. It's borderline  soap-opera. <br />In a technical vein, I found the dialog a bit stilted. I  also, in the beginning of the book at least, found it hard to figure out  what day it was or even the time of day. It seems like many of those little  anchor points that keep you grounded in the story were missing. I also felt  the book went about three chapters past the spot it should have ended.<br />I  feel bad in a way putting down this book. I have tremendous respect for  anyone who can sit down and write a novel from start to finish and then get  it published. I've tried and I know the odds. However, I think this book  needed some more work. Would I recommend it? Yes, if you like mysteries I  think you should give it a shot. This is the author's first book so he  hasn't hit his stride yet. With some polishing and tighter editing I think  this book really could have been very good. Perhaps the authors next will  be better.	2000-05-25

We follow him from the time of McArthur's return to liberate the Phillipines in early 1945 and through the beginning of the  peacetime Japanese occupation. Jay is privy to all of McArthur's inside  politics and in-fighting, and in the beginning he finds it heady stuff.  However Jay finds that the power he weilds in McArthur's name soon  disillusion him and threaten to ruin his future with his beautiful Filipina  fiancee. <br />Mr. Webb is an excellent writer. His sense of place is very  strong and he easily convinces us we're right there as the battle for Leyte  is being fought. It's also obvious he knows Japanese culture. The  historical background seems to be very well done. If he's taken liberties  with history I'm not aware of it. If you like historical fiction,  especially as it applies to WWII I'd recommend this book. It will give you  insights into an era that's usually not covered in great detail. It's also  an entertaining story.	2000-05-21

If so, the detectives wonder, why are there faint marks around the corpse's neck?  And why are the hands and feet showing more lividity than the rest of the  body. It's almost as if he's been hung. <br />I don't think anyone does the  ensemble police procedural better than McBain. As is usual in the 87th  mysteries, it takes various teams of detectives to finally put all the  clues together. Even Fat Ollie Weeks from the 88th gets into the act and  supplies important clues that lead to the final solution. <br />As always with  McBain's 87th Precinct novels, the dialogue is crisp and tight, the  characterization right on the money, and few words are wasted. <br />I'd  recommend this book to current 87th Precinct fans and to anyone who wants  to read a good police procedural.	2000-05-15
US	52644129	R1ZO5AQNL543KY	055310666X	284106836	False Memory	Books	3	10	11	N	N	A great plot idea, though it does suffer somewhat.	Dean Koontz has a hell of an imagination, there's no getting around that. False Memory is a foray into mind-control that will leave you worrying about whether it could really happen. <br />Martie and Dusty Rhodes are a nice young couple living in Southern California. Martie's best friend, Susan,  suffers from agoraphobia (fear of open spaces) and Martie helps her by  literally forcing Susan out of her apartment and taking her for her therapy  sessions. Suddenly Susan reveals that she is being raped at night by her  ex-husband, however, even though she locks all doors and windows and even  wedges a chair under the door knob he still manages to get in. The clincher  is, she has no memory of the attacks and none of the doors or windows have  been tampered with. In fact, the chair is still wedged under the door knob.  She only knows he's been there from the semen stains he's left behind. From  this point strange things begin to happen to Dusty and Martie too.<br />As I  said in my title, I think the plot idea is great. Mr. Koontz once did a  short story (whose name escapes me) using the same premise and I remember  the story being taut and suspenseful. I was hoping we were headed in the  same direction with this story too, but it was not to be. <br />For one thing,  the book suffers from bloat. It's really too long. It could stand some  editing, but what seems to be happening today is major authors no longer  get edited. That's too bad. Compared to Koontz's previous  &quot;Watchers&quot; or &quot;Lightning&quot; the book is  lethargic.<br />Another thing, the villian, though interesting, is almost too  over the top. Whenever we're seeing things from the villians point of view  it becomes semi-comic which destroys any tension built up from previous  scenes. So you never really do get that &quot;This tension is killing me, I  can't wait to see what happens&quot; feeling. This book never becomes an  &quot;I can't put it down&quot; thriller. Actually, it's quite easy to putdown and resume later. <br />Authorial asides. He's doing this more and more.  Those little comments about today's culture he keeps throwing into the  book. Most are right on target, some are funny, but none of them belong  here. Fiction is a suspension of disbelief, an entrance into the author's  created world. And every time he throws us one of these tidbits he reminds  us we're really reading a book and he's the author. Each time I read one of  these I always have the mental image of Mr. Koontz standing there with a  smug, &quot;aren't I just too clever&quot; smile on his face. This is  jarring and it drains any tension that has been built up. It's also the  kind of thing a beginning writer would not be allowed to get away with.  <br />The ending. ... <br />Would I  recommend this book? I guess so. As I said, the plot idea really is good.  Though I did find myself skimming there are some very good scenes in here.  The scene where Martie and Dusty are kidnapped by two goons in Santa Fe is  really suspenseful and you keep wondering how they're going to get out of  this jam. So, there is some good stuff, however, you might want to wait  until the paperback comes out so it will cost you less.	2000-05-11

Jay Becker, sailing instructor and part-time musician, takes on the beautiful, but aloof Marlene as a new student. Soon Jay finds himself engulfed in an FBI sting operation with discredited agent Roy Kapella, and shady German spy Iben Holst. Will Jay survive as Iben Holst sends his  trusted Chinese henchman, John Chu, after Jay to silence him permanently?  Will Roy Kapella be able to trap Holst and his shadowy boss, the notorius  Wilhelm? It all hangs in the balance until almost the last page.<br />Did I  like this book? Well...not as much as other of Mr. Pearson's books. The  plot seemed unecessarily convoluted to me and at times seemed to wander.  Another reviewer wrote that this was Ridley Pearson's second book, and I  can believe it. It doesn't show much of the style of his later works,  especially the well-written Lou Boldt novels. It's possible my problem with  the book is more the genre than the book itself since this book is more a  spy type novel rather than a mystery. I've never really been partial to spy  novels. My recommendation? Give it a try. Mr. Pearson is still a good  writer, better than many out there.	2000-05-02

The author was able to follow Marine recruit company 3086 from the day they arrived at Parris Island until the day the graduated, eleven weeks later. He's able to show us what goes on in boot camp and how the Marines  are able to take young men from many backgrounds and mold them into  &quot;the band of brothers&quot; that is the Marine Corps. But this is not  just a public relations book showing only the good side of the Corp. The  author also delves into the widening difference between Marine Corp and  mainstream United States culture and how the Corp is becoming more and more  isolated in their thinking. The author also follows certain recruits beyond  boot camp and shows how some of them embraced the Marine life while others  rejected it and left the Corp for various reasons. <br />I would recommend  this book to anyone who wants to know how the military works. I'm a Navy  veteran from Vietnam, and though I've been through Navy boot camp it was  nothing like what the Marines go through. But even if you've never been in  the service you'll gain insight into what it takes to make an all-volunteer  elite combat force.	2000-04-28

Before he retired, Gary Aldritch was one of the two FBI agents assigned to the White House to conduct security and background checks on both the permanent White House staff and appointees. In this book he chronicles the difference between what went on in the Bush administration and the Clinton  one.<br />I'm not a Clinton fan, far from it, but much of what Aldritch  condemns the Clinton administration for is a little silly. He complains  that the Clinton staff didn't dress as well as the Bush staff. They weren't  as clean, as neat, didn't show the proper respect. I suspect what we're  seeing is a generation gap between the old guard represented by Aldritch  and the newer, more laid-back adults of today. <br />However, even with that,  many of the things that Aldritch says he witnessed are scary, if they're  true. Things such as staff members doing hard drugs right in the White  House. Things such as staff members with no security clearance privy to the  most classified information. The problem with the book is, it's really his  word against theirs. <br />I'd recommend you read this book but take it with a  grain of salt. I only hope he did exaggerate or blew some of these things  out of proportion. I'd really hate to think any President, would do some of  the things Aldritch says he did.	2000-04-25

As has been noted in other reviews, this book covers the Eastern theater of WWII from D-day to  Germany's surrender. It is a very good narrative, mainly taken from personal narritives of those who were actually there. If you've never read Ambrose's other books on this period, this is a very good  overview.<br />However, that said, I have read most of Ambrose's other books  (D-Day, Citizen Soldier, etc) and found that this narrative was lifted  almost verbatim from many of those books. The book does serve a purpose in  that it ties this period all together into one volume, however if you've  already read the other books you'll find nothing new here.	2000-04-25

So this book was quite a change for me. <br />The book covers, in great detail, the English civil war between the Lancasters and  the Yorks. It gives a very thorough background on what led up to the war,  starting with the reign of Richard II and up to the final battle when  Edward IV finally defeats the supporters of Henry VI. But it's not just  about battles. It also shows the shifting alliances, the court intrigues,  and all the other machinations that went on behind the actual fighting. As  the book says, the total battle campaigns only lasted about a year out of  the total thirty-years of war.<br />I found the book interesting, however it  was slow going at times. As other interviewers have mentioned, the author  many times uses a person's title instead of their name. Then, at other  times she uses the name. This can make it very difficult to figure out who  she's talking about. I suspect part of the problem may have been my  unfamiliarity with English history. But I was able to persevere and I've  learned a great deal. Would I recommend this book? Yes. Are there better  books out there dealing with this period? I don't know. However, the author  does make the period interesting even though she has a great deal of  information to impart. Most readers of history would not find this book  daunting.	2000-04-21

Now they're both police detectives who come together as partners once again to investigate the kidnapping of a 12-year old girl. However, it's deja vu  since Bank's 13-year old adopted daughter had been kidnapped seven years  earlier and never been found. Holden deftly interweaves the two cases  showing us the similarities and how both men react to them. And when  fingerprints found at the earlier crime scene match ones from the new, it  leads to some startling revelations.<br />Very good book. It is well written,  suspenseful, thought-provoking, and rich in characterization. It moves  along well and throws in some unexpected plot twists. Craig Holden is an  excellent writer able to balance the plotting requirements of a good  mystery as well as the artful prose of an interesting book. I recommend  this book highly to not only mystery lovers but also to those who just want  a good read.	2000-04-12

To make it even more  difficult, a Chinese-american reporter goes undercover and then goes  missing while investigating the same case. Boldt and his crew must race  against time to find where she's being held before she's killed.<br />Mr.  Pearson is an excellent writer and plot spinner and even though this entry  is not as strong as his others, it's still head and shoulders above most of  what passes for mystery writing on the market today. I do admit I didn't  find it as compelling as his &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; but it wasn't bad.  The characters do seem a little less richly drawn than usual but the prose  is still strong. You could do worse than read this book.	2000-04-06

It deals with three members of the 87th detective squad being gunned down for no apparent reason and how the rest of the 87th goes about finding the  killer. <br />Crime novels in those days were less introspective and more lean  so McBain wastes no time getting to the heart of the matter with the first  corpse occurring rather quickly. However, as with all Ed McBain novels, the  writing is crisp, the dialogue snappy, and though the page-count of these  earlier novels was less than it is today he still manages to flesh out his  characters and make them interesting. <br />Just as interesting is the forward  where Mr. McBain discusses how the series came into being and how it  evolved to its present form.<br />If you've never read this installment of the  87th, or just haven't read it in a long time, I urge you to pick it up. Ed  McBain truly is a good writer whether he's writing crime novels under the  Ed McBain alias or &quot;serious&quot; novels under his own name, Evan  Hunter.	2000-03-30

Instead, he gets embroiled in the feud between the stereotypical English lord and the noble Irish peasentry. Clay is not only a CSA cavalry  combat veteran but a trained surgeon. He's the type of hero who can't be  kept down by mere beatings or gunshot wounds. He takes a licking and keeps  on ticking. It also doesn't help that all the book's action is compressed  into a few days. All Clay seems to do is fly about the countryside on the  back of his faithful steed from one confrontation to another. <br />One of the  other reviews mentioned that this story was originally written in 1963. In  fact, after getting halfway through the book I checked the copyright date  because the story gave me the impression of being written by a rather green  author. However, the copyright on my book only shows 1999. Perhaps it's one  of Higgen's earlier stories that sat in a drawer for 30 years. <br />In any  event, I don't think the book measures up to some of the author's other  works. Unless all you want is a time filler I'd suggest a pass on this  book.	2000-03-28

Edward Ball's ancestors were the owners of South Carolina rice plantations from about 1700 until 1950. They also owned slaves. This book shows how the Ball family and the slave families lives became so intertwined that the  connections last even today. Though it is a chronicle of one family, it is  also a chronicle of slavery from the 1700's until slavery was abolished  after the Civil War. But it doesn't stop there. Mr. Ball is able to follow  some of the former slave families into the present to see how they've  fared.<br />Did I like this book? Yes. I happen to like history and I  especially like to see how history affects us today. However, I think the  book needed more of a chronological presentation. There was too much  jumping back and forth, too many names to keep track of, so eventually  toward the end of the book I felt overwhelmed. There are many interesting  stories in this book that make it worth slogging through, but it is a slog.	2000-03-28

As the LA streets threaten to  erupt in another riot, Harry Bosch is forced to look at his fellow officers  for the killer. Harry's former partner is the number one suspect, but Harry  follows the trail outside the department to a pedophile ring. But will he  be able to prove his friend is innocent?<br />Another good Harry Bosch novel.  The characters are all well-drawn and believable, the plot is well-crafted,  the ending is poetic justice, and the writing is flawless. What more could  you ask for in a mystery? Highly recommended.	2000-03-23

This book covers the time between when young Cassius Clay won the Olympic gold medal in boxing until he emerged as the premiere fighter of the '60's when he beat Floyd Patterson  in 1965. <br />Until Ali came along, heavyweight fighters were expected to  fight flat-footed and use their superior strength and hitting power to  defeat their opponents. Ali showed them a different way with his  &quot;float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&quot; way of fighting. And  there was always his bragging. Ali knew very well what he was doing with  his poems and his ever-running mouth. They sold tickets to his fights, pure  and simple. But in his first fight with Liston even he wasn't sure if he  could deliver on his boasts.<br />If you've ever wondered how it was in the  '60's when Clay fought the bear, Sonny Liston, this is a must read. You'll  learn things about Muhammad Ali that haven't been covered before. I'd  recommend this book highly.	2000-03-20

This book cuts through all of the &quot;Top Gun&quot; hoopla and tells you what it's really like to become a Naval aviator. The author follows a number of pilot trainees as they go through pilot training from beginning  student flights right up to qualifying for carrier night landings. The  emphasis is on flying jet aircraft, but for most people that's what defines  Naval aviation. The author also gives good insight into Naval culture in  the post-tailhook era. I found the book enjoyable. Even though I'm not a  pilot or a miltary buff I enjoy reading the inside story about how things  are done. My only negative comment is that some chapters could have been  shorter. The chapter on dogfighting really dragged and I finally skipped  the last third. But all in all it was an interesting read.	2000-03-09

First, you have to understand it's not a biography. Actually the book's premise is summed up very well by the Sinatra quote on the dust jacket. &quot;I think my real amibition is to pass on to others what I know. It  took me a long, long time to learn what I now know, and I don't want that  to die with me.&quot; I think this book does that very well using a series  of ancedotes culled from Mr. Sinatra himself as well as others. It covers  things such as the Las Vegas &quot;Rat Pack&quot; years, his style of  dress, his code of conduct, his loyalty to friends. The book succeeds in  what it was meant to do, but to get a real feel for the total man I'd  suggest reading one of the many fine biographies that are out there.  Whether you love or hate Frank Sinatra you'll have to admit he was a very  complex man who lived life on his own terms. This book will give you some  insights into what drove him to be the way he was.	2000-03-06

Joe Gunther investigates the death of a recluse who died from a twenty-year old bullet wound. The trail eventually leads to the discovery of a skeleton with an artificial knee (the skeleton's knee of the title). From there the mystery deepens as Gunther  traces the artificial knee back to Chicago and to the radical movement of  the 1960's. By the time it's over Gunther up to his neck in the mob and  remnants of the old radical movement.<br />Mr. Mayor is a fine writer and the  book moves along very well from discovery to discovery. But the author  doesn't forget about his characters and concentrate on plot only. His  characters are fully fleshed out and well drawn. <br />This is a good mystery  and also a very good police procedural. I would recommend this to all  mystery lovers.	2000-03-05
US	52644129	R1JY5CTE54KT48	0446403768	215777910	The Dark Root (Joe Gunther Mysteries)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Well written, but tends to plod a bit.	First, let me say that Mr. Mayor certainly knows police procedure. I don't know if his background is in law enforcement or not (mine is not) but the whole thing sounds very convincing to me. The story concerns Lt. Joe  Gunther of the Brattleboro Vt. police department and his attempts to  unravel the murder of Benny Travers, one of Brattleboro's less savory  citizens. All the signs begin to point to an Asian gang invasion of  Brattleboro and the surrounding communities and Mr. Mayor leads us  convincingly through the process that Lt. Gunther takes to solve the  murder. <br />Mr. Mayor is a good writer and his sense of place is very  strong, however I found the writing very un-emotional. It almost seems as  if you're reading a police report rather than a fictional mystery. There is  also a large cast of characters and it's sometimes hard to keep them  straight. Especially since many of the characters in this book or oriental  with both their given names and their anglicized names used  interchangeably. <br />Would I recommend this book? Yes, with some  reservations. If you like police procedure this book is excellent. I don't  think Mr. Mayor takes any liberties at all with reality when he describes  what Lt. Gunther has to go through to not only conduct his investigation  but to appease the beauracracy in his own department. So it's a very  realistic book. However, if you like a more slam-bang approach (which I  admit, I do) you may find this book just a tad tedious.	2000-02-29
US	52644129	R2POOKQ9R08OK7	0425170357	76871705	Trick of Light	Books	4	16	16	N	N	Dark, but interesting.	David Hunt, pen name of &quot;Janek&quot; novels creator William Bayer, has given us another dark tale of San Francisco photographer Kay Farrow. Farrow is grief-stricken by the hit-and-run death of her friend and mentor, Maddy Yamada. But she also wants to know what her mostly-homebound friend  was doing in one of San Francisco's seedier neighborhoods in the middle of  the night. Thus begins her quest which leads to a tony Mendocino gun club  and also leads her forty years into her mentor's past. <br />As with all of  William Bayer's novels, the writing is tight and the characterization is  rich. Kay is a strong but caring woman. She has the ability to be violent  and the means (she is an-almost black-belt in Akido and during the novel  she learns combat-shooting) but to Bayer's credit he never uses this to  advance the story. <br />I liked the book and would recommend it to anyone who  wants to read a thoughtful, well-written thriller. It is way above the  usual cliche-ridden mystery stories that seem to abound today. And, miracle  of miracles, it doesn't even have a serial killer.	2000-02-24

It is also very readable, managing to stay away from the usual dry-as-dust tone of many history books. To me, the most important thing  this book did was to humanize the great men who shaped our nation. Too  often all we know about men like Benjamin Franklin or George Washington are  myths and half-truths. Here they are portrayed as men. Men who have doubts,  men who grow weary, lose their tempers, feel dispair. Perhaps not ordinary  men, but certainly not mythical figures. <br />The one overriding message I  took from this book was how precarious our revolution really was and how  close to failure it came. <br />The paintings and historical sidebars add to  the overall understanding of the period. I'd highly recommend this book to  anyone.	2000-02-22

I especially like the &quot;Programming Tips and Gotchas&quot; that are listed with  every command. They contain the little things that you usually only learn  about through experience and they really do save you a lot of time. Another  helpful thing, after each command there's a list of related commands.  <br />All in all this is a great resource for the professional programmer. And  the clincher is that it's relatively inexpensive as far as computer books  go.	2000-02-18

Three kids walk into his office and want to hire him to find their missing father. Before it's over Cole is up to his neck in the Russian mafia, Vietnamese patriots, the Federal  witness protection program, and a &quot;funny money&quot; scheme. <br />The  book is well plotted and moves along nicely, with a few unexpected twists  and turns. Cole is his usualy wise-cracking self and Joe Pitt is as quiet  and grim as ever. I've read all of Mr. Crais' novels and I don't know if  this is better than the rest, but it's just as good. These guys always  remind me of Robert Parker's Spenser and Hawk characters with their byplay.  All in all a good book.	2000-02-14

This book chronicles the one year he spent teaching in a two-room schoolhouse on Yamacraw Island off the coast of South Carolina. It is a moving and often  funny story of one man's attempt to bring education to eighteen  mostly-forgotten black children. Children who didn't know the name of the  ocean at their front door, didn't know who was their President, didn't even  know the name of the country they lived in. However the story never becomes  maudlin and the tone is upbeat throughout. Many times I found myself  laughing out loud. Mr. Conroy is an excellent writer. I recommend this book  highly.	2000-02-11

However, Jesse Stone, police chief of Paradise, Mass. is not Spenser. He is  Spenser-like in that he's self assured, competent, and has a dry sense of  humor. <br />The story revolves around an attempted heist of all the valuables  on ritzy Stiles Island. Career criminal James Macklin assembles a crew of  specialists who plan to isolate the island from the nearby mainland and at  their leisure pluck all of the residents clean of anything valuable. Of  course, they don't realize they'll have to deal with Jesse Stone.<br />I  didn't like the book as much as I like the Spenser novels. This is probably  not fair to Parker because when this book is compared to other authors in  writing in the same genre it is very good indeed. The sharp Parker dialogue  is there along with the rapidly moving pace of the whole novel. A real  Chief of Police wouldn't be able to get away with some of the things that  Jesse Stone does, but hey, this IS fiction after all. All-in-all a good  book for mystery lovers.	2000-02-11

I think Kinsey Millhone is my favorite among all of the female PI's that abound today and I find that Ms. Grafton is consistent in her portrayal from book  to book. &quot;O&quot; is no exception to that.<br />There were many things I  liked about this book. The way it begins with Kinsey breaking into  someone's house because she won't pay $10 for information is funny.  Kinsey's outlook is just a little off-center and I find that amusing. So, I  liked the book. However, after saying all of that I was disappointed in the  ending. I hate it when the protagonist does something dumb just to advance  the plot. I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't read it  yet, however, if you're being pursued by someone who has a gun and you're  pretty sure this person means to harm you would you drive right past not  one, but TWO Santa Teresa deputy cars and the LAPD detectives who are  backing you up? I don't think so. This was clearly designed to end the book  in a certain way at a certain place but it was done in an unbelievable way.  With all of Ms. Grafton's expertise this surprised me. Good book anyway.  Kinsey Millhone is head and shoulders above her other sisters in crime.	2000-02-07

If one chooses Sherlock Holmes as one's protagonist, one should at least try to adhere to the core of the character. Sadly, Mr. Millett does not. I personally do like the original stories by Conan-Doyle, however, I'm not a  fanatic about it. I've read Holmes books by other authors that have carried  on the tradition quite well. This was not one of them. Where is Holmes  deductive logic? He spends his time wandering around this book baffled by  everything that occurs. He &quot;deduces&quot; that a man has seen a woman  by the red hair on the man's coat and the lipstick on his collar. Hell,  even I could to that! Both Holmes and Watson seem equally lifeless and  Rafferty is a buffoon Irishmen with his &quot;tis&quot; and  &quot;twas&quot; way of speaking. Take away the Sherlock Holmes hook and  this is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill genre mystery, which seem to be  the norm more and more today. Sorry, Mr. Millett, but if you're going to do  it, do it right. If you use the world's most famous consulting detective  than at least remain true to the character.	2000-02-01

This isn't usually my type of mystery book, however I found the view of Victorian England interesting. Of course, not knowing much about Victorian England I'm taking a lot of what Miss Perry says on faith. I did find  myself skipping over portions of exposition when I found the going a little  slow. The revelation about two-thirds through the book was well done. I  found the last third as an anti-climax. Will I read another one of these?  Probably not, but never say never.	2000-01-25

I've read just about everything he's written. However, the similarities between Sunny Randall and Spenser are just too numerous to make this enjoyable. This  could have just as easily been a Spenser novel and it probably would have  been better if it was. Parker wants to make Randall as competent as Spenser  but when the going gets tough she has to turn to her male friends to help  her out of jams. I'll probably pass on the next Sunny Randall novel if  there is one. I think Parker has few peers when writing from the male point  of view but when he turns to the female I think he could take some lessons  from Sue Grafton.	1999-12-30

However, that said, Perry is still a better mystery writer than 90% of the authors of this genre. My feeling was the  book went on a little too long. I like, and have always liked, the utter  competence of Jane Whitefield. There doesn't seem to be much that fazes her  or puts her off her stride. Not a bad book but the others in this series  are just a little tighter and more suspenseful	1999-12-21

I still think Mr. Wood's best book has been &quot;Chiefs&quot;. I've had varying success with his books, liking some, not liking others. This one I liked. It entertained me, the characters seemed reasonably intelligent, and  they were likeable. It wasn't great literature but it wasn't meant to be.  The story moved along well and the plot, though a little far-fetched,  wasn't too bad. All in all not a bad read. Certainly better than sitting in  front of the TV.	1999-11-19

It made Constantin Vadim more real to me. After reading  some of the stupid serial murder mysteries out there I found this one  entertaining. The author does not insult his reader's intelligence.
