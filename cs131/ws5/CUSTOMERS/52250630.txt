In a easy and straightforward style, Debbie Ford gets readers to look at the conscious and unconscious choices they make every day which greatly impact their lives.  I've read so much in this category that I was skeptical about this book -- just another \\"self-help\\" book, I thought.  But I will say Debbie Ford got me thinking about things in a new way, and I ended up devising questions to ask myself which have given me insight into my own direction-- I'd say she met her objective with me!   <br /> <br />There is nothing ground-breaking in this book -- rather, it's the style and approach which leads to deep self-discovery for the reader.  I recommend it.	2005-05-31

Ellen's writing is crisp, engaging and really, really funny.  I did indeed, LOL, which is embarrassing in a gynecologist's office.  Nonetheless, I can't think of a soul who wouldn't like this book and at least get a chuckle, if not an outright belly laugh.  Great beach read.	2005-05-25

It may sound hyperbolic, but it's true.  This book can fundamentally change the way you see your life -- just by questioning what you \\"know\\" is true.  Katie has hit upon a simple, get direct, method to get at underlying false beliefs which restrict people's choices and the direction of their lives.  I understand from clients that the audio version of this book is also excellent.  If you want to begin your journey inward, take this book along.	2005-05-25

It's one of those books which improve every time you read it -- and you should read it more than once.  If you're recently separated and feel as if your life is topsy-turvy, read this book.  Then, read it again a few months later.  Your perspective shifts and you get something else, equally valuable and meaningful.  If you do proceed to divorce, read it again. Again, you will find something new which will help you go on to build a wonderful life for yourself.   <br /> <br />I agree that this book is not just for married people.  It's for anyone who has felt betrayed in an intimate relationship of any sort.  Debbie Ford stresses that it's your life and your spirituality which must be upheld, even in the darkest of times.  This book goes a long way toward helping you do just that.	2005-05-25

I had the great opportunity to work with Jim in the White House and am happy to call him a friend.  I have admired him for years -- more importantly, I revere Jim's humility, and his ability to see his time with President Reagan and other players on history's stage as not about him, but about being able to serve a larger purpose in a quiet yet meaningful way.  If you are interested in what actually happens day to day as history is made in the West Wing, I recommend you read this book.	2004-07-25

I was a little concerned, however, that I knew so little about the time period in which the book was set -- England's War of the Roses.  Those concerns drifted away as I got more and more into the book.  What beautiful writing!  What clear analysis of the political machinations of the 15th century!  What human-ness Penman gives her characters!  Those reviewers who have called this book a &quot;tour de force&quot; are completely correct.  This is a great, illuminating book, and one I am glad to have read.	2002-04-15

It is a perfect example of its genre -- hardboiled, 40s style, film noir, tough-guy-with-no-heart-of-gold fiction.  I have lived in the DC area for over 30 years so I especially appreciated the geographical nuance.  There is much more to this city than politics, media and sex.  There is crime, gangs and sex, too.  Pelecanos knows this intuitively and gives the reader a great ride thru the \\"seamy underbelly\\" of Washington, DC.  Pelecanos has a keen understanding of the racial dynamics of the city in the 30s and 40s, which pervades our lives today.  Overall, this is a really good story well told.  I can't wait to read another of his books.	2002-03-30

To a woman, we found this book difficult to plow through. Thurman is enamored of subordinate clauses, tangential references and elliptical thoughts.

Not exactly rocket-science, but a good and timely reminder.  Dr. Kindlon urges parents to use TLC -- Time, Limits and Caring -- as the means for our children grow to be the independent adults they will need to be.  His discussion of the politics surrounding college placement were very revealing to me.  Some parents have the expectation that their child is destined for Harvard which is, very likely, setting that child up for failure.  The big plus in this book is that much of it is drawn from statistical research, so Dr. Kindlon backs up his assertions on &quot;indulgent parenting&quot; with reasonable science. I really appreciated this book, and hope you do, too.	2001-10-23

This book gives tremendous insight into the minds of those who would wreck havoc in the name of faith.  This book reminds us that the struggle between faiths in the Holy Land has been going on for millenia -- since well before Saladin and Richard the Lionheart. Mr. Reston presents these leaders in an illuminating light, and provides a context for today's events.  His writing style is clear, concise and informative.

I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women.  We are a certain way with each other today, and we were the same with each other over two thousand years ago.  That is the real beauty of this book for me.  I think Anita Diamant did a remarkable job in capturing the essence of life for women B.C. She made me contemplate what it would have been like to not only know the story of Abraham and Issac, but to know both men as family members.  To have known Rebecca as a grandmother!  My goodness. I am not a Biblical scholar, but she brought this era to life for me.  In short, it's a wonderful book and I recommend it highly.	2001-07-19

Because Dr. Verghese explores the murky world of male-male platonic friendships much in the way &quot;Oprah Books&quot; look at the female-female relationship.  It's a beautifully written, and extremely honest, treatment of how men relate to one another and how their friendships are born and nurtured.  Unlike many of Oprah's selections, however, this one is not beach reading.  Rather, it is a book to be savored, and a book which will make you think.	2001-07-10

Having grown up and lived in the South my whole life, I was ready for a really good read.  Boy, was I disappointed.  The book seems more like disjointed short stories featuring the same characters than anything else.  The plot lines veer toward melodrama and stereotype and I found myself reading with growing impatience and annoyance.  Bottom line:  I do not recommend this book to any of my friends.  If you want really good writing about the women of the South, read Ellen Gilchrist.	2001-07-03

But I will say this:  The Mists of Avalon is a great read! I was totally absorbed in the story line and actually asked my husband to please take the kids and leave me alone so I could read!  The book takes on so many things -- change, loyalty, sex, love, intrigue -- and leaves the reader breathless and totally satisfied.

This book, however, takes a tack which will inform even the most casual poetry reader.  Editor Carmen Ciuraru asked writers to name the poem which inspired them to write -- so, in this handy volume, you get a short essay about a poem and then get a chance to read the poem itself.  It includes a wide range of poets and poetic forms, from Yeats and Dickinson to Rilke and Williams.  It's also fairly easy to read because you can select certain essays to read in one sitting.

I think the device of a woman looking back on her life on the occasion of her last afternoon on earth is quite brilliant.  I read that Kaye Gibbons mentored Charles Frazier through his writing of Cold Mountain.

My lack of knowledge didn't keep me from enjoying this extremely well-written and engaging book.  Laura Hillenbrand has done an exceptional job bringing the racing world of the 30s to life.  I was swept up in the drama and emotion, and loved every minute of the narrative.

This book reveals the flaw in that way of thinking, because Fisher was truly one of the great writers of the last century.  &quot;Among Friends&quot; tells the story of her growing up in the 1910s in Whittier, California -- a Quaker community.  A non-Quaker, she tells of the gentle, exclusive bigotry of the Friends.  She also describes a California which has all but vanished -- the drive from Whitter to Ventura was an overland trek!  And, her culinary memory is astonishing.  She describes in glorious detail what her family ate and how she came to her love of good food, well prepared.  This book works on so many levels, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2000-12-01

Here's what I will tell her --  it's about 85% accurate about how traveling presidential campaigns work,  and that missing 15% created a problem for me.  I kept saying,&quot;That  would never happen&quot; or &quot;He'd never do that.&quot;  And, the plot  is too thin.

I became so absorbed in the book that I didn't go out in the sun until I had finished it.  The descriptions of the people, animals  and plants of Africa is intriguing, but the story of love, life and loss is  mezmerizing.  Kuki Gallmann is a gifted writer and one who brings the  reader right inside her world.

For me, this book provided a glimpse into her world, and by extension, my world.  I can't  imagine riding a wagon or walking for miles wearing a long-sleeved, long  dress in scorching heat.  Or, for that matter, preparing meals, being  pregnant, taking care of children, or burying a loved one on the side of  the road.  But these women did all these things in stride.  Modern women  focus on what women weren't able to do in the 19th century but this book  shows that women have always been strong, brave and capable.  It's a  wonderful book which you will enjoy for years to come.	2000-06-25

The prose is compelling, the story engaging but Moran forces the reader to pay attention -- is James hallucinating?  Is it fantasy or is it real?  This would be a  difficult book for some people to read because on one level it is about the  loss of control -- of your mind and your body.  I think Moran chooses his  words carefully but achieves an astonishing balance -- his writing is not  at all self-conscious.  I will admit that I began to care about James so  much  that I worried about being able to finish the book -- so, I skipped  ahead, read the end and then was able to go back and read the rest.  If I  hadn't, I doubt I would have been able to finish for the emotion.  This is  a wonderful book, and you should buy it.	1999-11-29
