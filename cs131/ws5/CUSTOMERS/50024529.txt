I have been an avid reader since I learned to read and have had a book in my face since Jr. High, in the 40's, when I discovered Pearl Buck. Have read almost everything from the Literary Guild to the Mystery Guild. I have read all of Julia London's books. But in &quot;The Secret Lover&quot; she went a long way to create a character that is so completely unable to think for herself, the most insipid, weak minded female I have ever read about. Yet at the same time created Caleb, a perfectly wonderful, kind, understanding man. Sophie actually disgusted me to the point that Ms London has lost a reader.  Good luck trying to undue someone like Sophie in your next book.	2002-08-01

Dominic was a perfect hero and Olivia is just the match for him. Add the sweet love story of Emily and Andre. Dominic was half Gypsy, half English felt he didn't belong with either and was rejected by his peers. His strength helped overcome all the predjudism he had to face. There is still world wide predjudice against Gypsies. I loved seeing them as a child (in the 40's) in downtown Los Angeles, they have always fascinated me and I love reading about them. A wonderful book and I recommend it to all who love, love and a happy ending.	2002-03-03

I have read many of her books,WHITNEY, MY LOVE; A KINGDOM OF DREAMS; UNTIL YOU;  ALMOST HEAVEN but I really think this is my all time favorite. Just ordered ONCE and ALWAYS too. This story has such strong characters, Jenny is always plotting and trying to make bargains with God. Even her innocent stepsister finds the strength to do some plotting herself. But, of course, they usually backfire. Jenny's cruel step brother and the lies he spread aabout her made the clan turn against her. Her \\"Father\\" left a lot to be desired too, he could only hate and look for revenge. I loved Royce, a wonderful hero trying to maintain the reputation built on his name \\"The Black Wolf\\". My heart went out to them in the scene on the balcony comparing their make-believe \\"Kingdom\\" in their day dreams. When she shows tears, instead of disgust at seeing his many scars and then kisses them.....oh, my. I couldn't put the book down. This is a definite keeper and a MUST BUY.	2002-03-03

It was given to me free with the purchase of another book. I had never heard of Ms Fitzjames but she really can put a great story together. This action packed book had it all. Love interest, mystery and a bracelet with a puzzle to solve. It even combined Bridey, a very proper Boston lady, with a frontier hero. I loved the town of Potluck she created, built in tiers, with stairs leading to each street (reminded me of 1st and 2nd streets in downtown Seattle). The brothers that ran the &quot;Contraption&quot;, Digger always singing &quot;Sweet Betsy from Pike&quot; and his huge mule Ulysses. Can't forget the widow Ruth Spivey who ran the hotel and her secret love interest. Caught me with her surprise at the end too. I have read so many books that received a 5* rating just on the author's name when the book left much to be desired but I highly recommend this one to all who enjoy a book that grabs you on the first page and doesn't let go till the last.	2001-12-22

Even the horse &quot;raped&quot; her mare or one can assume he was DUMB enough to let her ride a mare in heat next to his monster destrier. Where was the story??all I read was the need for sex.

I was so glad that, at least at the end of the book, Bryan and Betsy got together. Her dialogue between these two adorable people was the most entertaining of all. I was also curious as to Ms. Doyle's possibly being a musician. Her love of music that is from her heart and in her soul.

As in so many books I read, the theme for this story is great, with a fair mystery. A lot of the dialogue was funny as times and Aurora was outspoken with wit. Unforturnately it becomes redundant and stretched out too long. It is what I call the yo yo syndrome. In this story she is a well brought up lady who gets drunk and sleeps with a gentleman, then is so ashamed of her actions she blames him.???? All the time she insists there is no such thing as love and if so it is too temporary and maybe she will get hurt. So she decides to marry a conceited, self- centered snob, as though that wouldn't hurt her one bit???. Both hero and heroine, as always, won't tell how they feel and so the romance goes up and down and the pondering goes on and on. At least Max has more sense and is wonderful but Aurora's reasoning leaves a lot to be desired. This would have been great if Ms Doyle had cut to the chase faster.	2001-12-18

I have read all of Karyn Monk's books except the latest and I love her writing. This book is no exception. I loved Armand with his many talents and intelligence. Was thrilled when she let Jacqueline grow and mature away from her snobbish upbringing. I bought this book not only because I enjoy her writing but I had to have it, as a keeper, for the cover as well. I wish more publishers would acknowledge the models or at least acknowledge the illustrator. Frank Accornero is one of the best along with Jon Paul and I love their work as much as the books.

I have read quite a few romance books every month and this is one of the best. I loved Remington and Antonia. The &quot;wager&quot; was so unique through the whole story. Too many times I feel the heroine is a ninny but Ms. Krahn has a great talent for creating super characters, such as all those sweet old ladies. The very knowledgeable Cleo was precious. I can hardly wait to start &quot;The Perfect Mistress&quot;. So many of her books are rated 5* and I agree. I definitely recommend this entertaining book.

All the main characters are so great. I loved Griffin's younger brothers, Cort and Scotty. Sir Thomas, Lady Min, Aunt Delphie are wonderful added characters to the story, even Gaspar his abused, lovable horse. The story is original and in so many ways very different from the norm.

I am so glad I did because &quot;Tangled Reins&quot; leads right into &quot;Fair Juno&quot; even though they could be read separately. Dorothea and Hazelmere are great strong characters and you have to love Ferdie. I thought Martin, Earl of Merton was wonderful although Helen was a stong character but at the same time a bit of a martyr and too sacrificial for my taste.

A young Taro card reader with a special gift is a new concept. The poor bored Alistair, Earl of Glenshiel wasn't too different except he spent his time robbing the rich instead of in the gaming hells of London. Rather a bored rich version of Robin Hood or a modern second story man, that she referred to as a &quot;cat burglar&quot;. He even returned stolen pearls after discovering they were given to the very rich young lady by her Mother and meant a lot to her. He is the first main character I have read about that didn't give a tinker's dam about anything or anyone, totally cold and heartless until he meets Jessamine. The final is worth reading the book. Ms. Stuart is an excellent writer and I enjoyed her &quot;Author's Note&quot; at the end of the book as much as the book itself.	2001-08-23

Alys and Claire as half-sisters had strength, courage, heart and many human weakness to match their love for each other. The characters were as different as the story line was from so many books I have read. But that is typical of Ms. Stuart's creative writing.  I only wish she had continued the story a little farther or written an epilogue to fill in the gaps..I would love to know how Thomas and Claire made it to his home to find happiness, and I hate to use my imagination in wondering what happened to wonderful Godfrey. Did Simon and Alys manage to go to all those different countries to live, love, and learn?

Sorry Ms. Smith but I am so glad I have read your earlier books with much better stories and with all those great characters.

Cory is so filled with love for everyone and the children haven't changed in all these centuries.  I enjoyed Ms. Lynnford's Historical Notes at the back of the book. After all this time an author took time to explain the card game Cent and that it later became Piquet. After reading so many historical novels that had these card games in them, now I know. Ms. Lynnford has a talent for coming up with very different story lines as in &quot;Lady Shadowhawk, training hawks and homing pigeons; Lord of Lightning has Margaret's bobbin lace works and all these family members are brought into this book too.

Maybe this book should be rated just on the dialogue which was a continuous verbal war. A battle of wits from 2 people trying to destroy each other with words. Ms. Beverley went deep to come up with such sophisticated insults.  She had to have done a lot of research, as well, to find so many perfect literary quotes. Still when the &quot;Rogues&quot; entered the story the excitement began and at that point I couldn't put the book down. The best is Nicholas' toast to Dare and all on page 327, so perfect too. That is why I gave it a 4 instead of the 3 I started to and because I love Blanche, Nicholas, Hal and all the other &quot;Rogues&quot; I have read about.(dare I end a sentence with a preposition??) My copy is one of the first printings in 1992, very much read and bought at auction and glad I won the bid.

I agree also that 2 of her Charm Bracelet series were not my type of reading. But she made up for it with the first one &quot;The Emerald Swan&quot; which is my absolute favorite, as I wrote in my comment. I was also thrilled to find another beautiful step-back by Pino Dangelico in this book.

What a magnificent story, with so much sensitivity written into the words. I am so happy I won the bid for this book at auction. I hope more will be able to find and read this very special story. I can only say it kept me up until 4:00 a.m. to finish it and I still can't get it out of my mind. Naturally I highly recommend this hard to find book. I know this will sound too dramatical but I must start another one to find what they call &quot;closure&quot;. Please, read this book.	2001-06-05

I haven't even finished it yet and love every word I have read. It is funny and has the most witty, quick retorts in the dialogue. The characters are perfect and Susan is as adorable as a giant mastiff can be. I have read so many of her books and this is my favorite already. I highly recommend this book for it's humor, wit, and entertaining very different story line. Hard to find but worth the effort.	2001-06-03

Dain could melt the South Pole with his smooth Italian phrases. It is also great to read of a hero that doesn't resemble a Greek god. Jessica will always be one of my favorite heroines, strong, great sense of humor and courage to put Dain right where she wants him. Loved this book.	2001-05-27

Ismal and Leila were the strongest most perfectly matched pair I have ever read about. Her speech technique for Comte d'Esmond was so perfect I could hear his accent and even the tone of his voice. Great love with a mystery that, at least for me, didn't unravel till the end. Loved everything about this book. Looking forward to reading the 4th in the series.	2001-05-27

As for his sleeping with his ward.....Chloe is the one that seduced him twice. Who's to say he wasn't that drunk, the first time, as a little alcohol goes a long way in reducing ones' inhibitions. It was funny too with all her animals and her unique way of finding them. Not to mention those original names. I have read a lot of Ms. Feather's books, some I didn't like because of the spousal abuse but this was a good story and I think it should have received better reviews,from more compassionate readers. Now to read my copies of Valentine and Vice.	2001-05-14
US	50024529	RPLIGSHGTYZII	0451155475	452601899	Lady of Fortune	Books	5	31	41	N	N	Wonderful, as always	I looked for so long for this book. The back cover says &quot;A bright new talent has broken fresh ground in the Regency genre&quot; This was from Romantic Times, in 1988, and they were so right. Christa is a strong young woman and a survivor at all costs, yet never bitter at what life has brought her, sweet, kind and compassionate. Everything Mary Jo Putney writes is fabulous. Her story lines are different from the ususal. I have now read almost all of them, although I am still waiting for &quot;China Bride&quot; to come out in paperback. Found her &quot;Diabolical Baron&quot; at an online auction and I wouldn't part with either books, they are keepers. Hope you can find them, they are worth the effort.	2001-05-12

Calum handled her perfectly and what a great hero. Loved the cover too, it helps to picture what the hero looks like while reading the story. As was John Desalvo on the cover on her &quot;Storm Prince&quot;. I definitely recommend this book if you can find it. I found my used copy on line and it was definitely worth the extra cost.	2001-05-11

It is funny as well as a great love story. I may be predjudice because I love reading about Selkies  Torcuil is so sweet and so innocently unaware of how to act or what to do on land.  Without Verity's help he would have really have had problems. A definite keeper and a recommended read. If you like Selkie stories too, try Christina Dodd's \\"A Well Favored Gentleman\\"  The first I had read about them was hint of them in \\"Midnight Warrior\\" by Iris Johansen	2001-05-11

Two wonderful people and so much in love. As a hero Basilio is one of the strongest, yet gentlest, with a beautiful heart. Loved every word and the biblical verse she refers to is one of my favorites including the 11th Commandment. A definite keeper and recommended read.	2001-05-11

It is the sweetest, most poignant love story. I also was delighted with his communicating with her through the names of roses. I thought her hero in Moon Lord was wonderful but....You have to read this book!!! As a diehard historical romance reader this one is the only contemporary I feel is a must read and a positive KEEPER. Also loved the cover as it reflects the characters and story so well....beautiful.	2001-04-20

The mystery wasn't difficult to figure out but that was a small part of the story. I loved his attitude everytime she mentioned Africa. I am now on book #4 and love Demon as much as Vane, Scandal, Devil. Everything she writes is great and like one other reader, I will buy anything with Stephanie's name on it. I highly recommend them to anyone who hasn't discovered her yet.	2001-03-25

I became a fan of hers and have read many of her books since. This was one of my favorites and held my interest till the very last page. I can't say the same about a few others of hers. But I have several on my waiting-to-read shelf. I have just purchased &quot;Venus&quot; and can hardly wait to read it.	2001-02-20

The twin Miranda is so clever and talented and possitively adorable. She is so different from her twin Maude who is withdrawn and silent....until. This was a very entertaining delightful story and I loved it. A keeper and definitely recommended reading, even if you don't read the other 2 books in the series. They are not sequels and I couldn't even understand the connection of the charms on the bracelet to each person. How did the ancient Swan end up in France so many years later?? How did the other charms end up in the hands of those involved?? Guess I missed something important somewhere.	2001-02-20

This is a fantastic ending to a series. So many times the last book is a let down or anticlimactic but not this one. I have not read a Jo Beverley book that wasn't great. I found her first in this series &quot;My Lady Notorious&quot; and was really thrilled to have the winning bid. It was well worth the extra cost and I am enthralled with Cyn and the entire Malloren family. I can easily recommend any or all of her books.	2001-02-19

Her characters are so strong and vivid that I feel I have had the priviledge of knowing all of them. Could there be a sweeter, kinder, more thoughtful man than Major David Lancaster?? How many of our servicemen had the same problem with morphine addiction after all our wars?? She is so aware of people, their trials and tribulations. I loved all of the &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; series. Was so happy to win the bid for her &quot;Diabolical Baron&quot;. Any and all of her books are beyond the beyond and I always look for something special...a quote or reference that sets off the scene or person to make it special. As her remark in one about the battle at Waterloo. The painting shows &quot;how all the victims of battle lie together in the democracy of death.&quot; Also her reference to John Wesley's (founder of the Methodist religious group)  Rule of Conduct: &quot;Do all the good you can, By all the means you can, In all the ways you can, In all the places you can, At all the times you can, To all the people you can, As long as ever you can.&quot; As you can tell I have saved all her &quot;author notes&quot; from every book I have read so far, she is the greatest and my favorite author. Buy any of her books, you will never regret it.	2001-02-19

This book has it way overboard. I will still try to read all the books on my waiting-to-be-read shelf but I can only hope she got SPOUSAL ABUSE out of her system. If not they will be traded for some light enjoyable reading. I bought this through [an] auction and really regret it. Sorry but I should probably stay with rereading Ms. Garwood or Jill Barnett.	2001-02-10

But this book has too much spousal abuse and depressing description of war. I was a teenager during WWII and I can do without both. I have several of her books that I haven't read yet and am now a bit leery of her stories. I am retired and read for enjoyment, entertainment and, as most of us, to escape reality. If I wanted this I could subscribe to a paper or watch CNN. I will perserve though as I can always use them for trading if I can't take anymore.<br />The premise of the story and the characters were strong and commendable. With all that I really appreciated Alex Marshall and what he was going through. Shades of our own Civil War with torn families.	2001-02-10

Skip lightly over a broken wrist, broken leg and the other leg a compound fracture yet in what seems no time at all he is up on crutches. Then leave the most important note on a cluttered desk expecting him to see it, just because she can't say it to his face. Drag the story out and then all of a sudden it's over and years have passed. The best part of this book is Granny Grace, Precious, her adorable daughter Bethany and the fact that I got it used with 2 trade-ins. Now I am afraid to try the other books in the MacKinnon series.  Maybe since this was the first the others will have a more exciting story that can hold my interest. I will try not to give up too soon on the other books in the series.	2000-12-23

They kept me in suspense but  not for so long I lost interest. They know how to cut to  the chase and I  can't get enough of their writing.
