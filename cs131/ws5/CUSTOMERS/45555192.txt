Herbert Parmet is a fine political historian of the \\"old\\" school (pre-political correctness), and \\"Never Again\\" ranks as one of his best books. Written with co-author Marie Hecht in 1968, \\"Never Again\\" is the story of the dramatic and colorful 1940 presidential campaign, which featured two of the most attractive and dynamic presidential candidates of the twentieth century: Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt and Republican Wendell Willkie. Roosevelt was running for an unprecedented third term as President, and Willkie may rank as the ultimate underdog, dark-horse presidential candidate.     Willkie wasn't even a politician in 1940 - he'd never held a single political office. Instead, he was a dynamic and self-made businessman from Indiana who kept up the pretense of being a shrewd country boy who'd made \\"good\\" in the big city of New York. In reality Willkie was an extremely intelligent and well-read man who had become popular with Liberal Northern Republicans by becoming an articulate and thoughtful critic of Roosevelt's New Deal programs. Willkie had been raised as a Democrat and had given money to Roosevelt's first presidential campaign in 1932, only to regret it when FDR used the federal government to break up the electrical power monopoly (Commonwealth and Southern), of which Willkie was CEO. He only switched to the GOP in the late thirties, which led many conservative Republicans in the Midwest to oppose him as a \\"Johnny-come-lately\\" who was too liberal for most Republicans. It's hard to imagine someone like Willkie being nominated by the Republicans today - he was a supporter of the New Deal welfare programs, and his main criticism of FDR was that his New Deal programs needed to be more friendly to businesses and corporations and that the bloated gov't bureacracy created by the New Deal should be streamlined. Most conservative Republicans simply wanted to abolish the New Deal and go back to the small gov't, low-tax days of the past, which Willkie said was impossible.     Willkie's nomination at the GOP Convention in Philadelphia in June 1940 was something of a miracle, and this book is at its best when describing Willkie's dramatic come-from-nowhere rise to the nomination. In January 1940 few Republicans had even heard of Wendell Willkie. However, the other leading candidates all had serious flaws - the frontrunner, New York's famed District Attorney Thomas Dewey, was only 38 years old, and many Republicans felt that he was simply too young and inexperienced in foreign affairs to be President. When the Nazis conquered France and Western Europe in May 1940, Dewey's stock dropped quickly. The conservatives' favorite candidate was Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, but his bland speaking style and icy personality led some Republicans to fear that he would lose as many votes as he attracted. Taft was also an isolationist who wanted to avoid war at all costs, and with the Nazis menacing Britain as the Convention began, some Republicans felt that his isolationism would be a handicap in a campaign against FDR. In effect, Willkie stepped into a vacuum, and his colorful personality and dynamic speaking style won over many converts who liked him in spite of his liberalism and recent conversion to Republicanism. At the GOP Convention - the authors note that no one who was there would ever forget it - Willkie's supporters packed the galleries and kept yelling \\"We Want Willkie\\". Willkie trailed in the early voting, but he steadily gained strength on each ballot until he was finally nominated, to the delight of his supporters, who cried, stomped their feet, and danced in the aisles.     Roosevelt, meanwhile, cleverly played a waiting game and only agreed to run at the last minute. The presidential campaign itself was something of an anticlimax - the inexperienced Willkie waged a gallant campaign, but lost his voice and had to speak in a whisper for most of the fall. Roosevelt wound up winning an historic third term by a comfortable 55-45% margin, but Willkie did claim the highest vote ever recorded by a GOP presidential candidate, and the authors argue that if World War Two had not been going on, Willkie might well have won (FDR was afraid he was going to lose right up until election night). In a nice contrast to modern campaigns, FDR met Willkie after the election and came to have a great deal of respect for him, even noting that it was \\"too bad that we (Democrats) lost him\\". If you're a political buff then this book should be a delight (I'd also recommend reading Herbert Parmet's \\"Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy\\", which is one of the best political biographies of JFK that I've read). Recommended!	2005-04-23

White (1915-1986) is widely regarded as one of the greatest journalists of the World War Two \\"G.I.\\" generation. TIME magazine once called him the \\"godfather of modern political reporting\\", and he is best known for his classic \\"Making of the President\\" series of books. From 1960 to 1980 White covered every presidential campaign and observed the political leaders who participated in them. He became so well-known that candidates from John Kennedy to Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan gave him unprecedented access to the inner workings of their campaigns. White's first book in the series - the bestselling \\"Making of the President 1960\\" (which covered the Kennedy-Nixon contest) earned him the pulitzer prize. Yet White was far more than just a political reporter, as this marvelous memoir proves.<br /><br />By 1976 White had grown both tired and bored of covering presidential politics, and so instead of doing another book on the '76 campaign, he decided to write his autobiography. In \\"In Search of History\\" White offers a superb chronicle of his remarkable life and career. Born and raised in a poor Jewish slum in Boston, White came from a family of intellectual Jewish immigrants who nonetheless experienced grinding poverty. In his youth White was in many ways a child prodigy - he was both brilliant and energetic. He sold newspapers to help his family pay the bills, attended Harvard University on a scholarship and became fluent in Chinese. In 1938 White, only 23, flew to China to cover that nation's heroic resistance to the Japanese invasion. He was soon hired by Henry Luce's powerful TIME-LIFE magazines to be their Asia correspondent, and for awhile he was Luce's star reporter. White vividly describes his experiences in China and Asia during World War Two, from a devastating famine to his meetings with legendary Chinese leaders such as General Chiang Kai-shek (whom he despised) and Communist leaders Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-tung (with whom he formed a wary respect).He also met the great American generals of the Asian theater of the war, such as Douglas MacArthur and Joseph Stilwell. White seems to have been present at a vast number of great historic events, and among his best descriptions is that of the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri in 1945. After the war White moved to Europe, where he covered that continent's attempts to rebuild and unite and America's efforts to help.<br /><br />In the fifties White began covering American politics, and then in the sixties he both covered and became a close friend of the Kennedy family - thus becoming (as he reluctantly admits) emotionally closer to his subject than he should have been. White's closeness to the Kennedys was dramatically revealed in late November 1963, when Jackie Kennedy personally chose him to discuss the intimate details of the assassination in Dallas and to write a \\"final word\\" about JFK. It was White's \\"Epilogue\\" (published in LIFE), that created the legend that Kennedy's Presidency was \\"Camelot\\" - a word which Jacqueline Kennedy insisted be used in describing her husband's administration. It is apparent from \\"In Search of History\\" that White led an extraordinary life and had many adventures (and misadventures) along the way. He is an engrossing writer, and despite the book's length I never grew bored or restless. Among the thousands of journalists of the twentieth century, White almost certainly belongs among the top ten, and this autobiography proves why. Highly recommended!	2004-08-07

To answer the reviewer's question below, the reason that this book doesn't include anything about the supposed UFO &quot;crash&quot; near Roswell, NM in July 1947 is because the Roswell crash was virtually unknown to the public until the 1980's, and this book was originally published in 1976. One of the myths about the Roswell crash is that it created the UFO phenomenon in America, when in fact it was the well-publicized sighting by Kenneth Arnold, a private pilot and businessman, in June 1947 that led to the first great wave of UFO sightings in America. The Roswell UFO crash was completely forgotten by the public (and, apparently, the Air Force) within a few days of the public announcement that a crashed &quot;flying disk&quot; had been recovered near Roswell. Instead, this book concentrates on printing the recently declassified, once top-secret files of Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official investigation of UFOs from late 1947 until late 1969, when it was officially shut down. Brad Steiger presents the original case files, field investigation reports, and scientific studies conducted by Project Blue Book for several famous UFO cases, most of which will be familiar to UFO buffs. Among the cases studied are the Kenneth Arnold sighting; the 1948 &quot;Mantell Incident&quot; in which a veteran fighter pilot was killed while chasing a UFO over Kentucky; the 1948 Gorman UFO &quot;dogfight&quot; in which a fighter pilot chased a UFO at night over Fargo, ND for a half-hour before finally giving up and returning to base; the files on the famed Washington UFO &quot;Invasion&quot; in July 1952 when several strange lights were seen over the nation's capital, detected by radar at two airports, and chased by fighters; the 1951 &quot;Lubbock Lights&quot; case in which science professors at Texas Tech University spotted strange lights over the city of Lubbock and a Texas Tech student took photos of them; and the 1964 UFO &quot;landing&quot; in Socorro, NM in which LonnieZamora, a respected local policeman, claimed to see a large egg-shaped object with two &quot;men&quot; in spacesuits in the desert outside of town. When the &quot;men&quot; saw him they boarded the craft and it took off, burning nearby bushes and rocking Zamora's patrol car. This case was thoroughly examined by Project Blue Book's staff, and it was the only case of a UFO &quot;landing&quot; which Blue Book labeled as &quot;unsolved&quot;, and possibly genuine. This book also offers other case files of UFO reports, and other &quot;primary&quot; research data which UFO researchers might find valuable. Overall, this is a good sourcebook of Blue Book and Air Force data on UFOs. However, it offers little beyond the case file reports, and the fact that some of these cases have been labeled as &quot;solved&quot; even by pro-UFO researchers, such as the Mantell Crash (he was almost certainly chasing a top-secret Skyhook balloon), and the Gorman &quot;dogfight&quot; (he was chasing a lighted weather balloon released a few miles away), does slightly reduce the book's value. Still, it's definitely worth buying for the remaining &quot;unsolved&quot; cases (Socorro, Kenneth Arnold, etc.). Recommended.	2004-04-26
US	45555192	R10K6CLAK5GZ14	B00005XZRM	968396449	The world of flying saucers; a scientific examination of a major myth of the space age	Books	3	4	7	N	Y	The "Blueprint" for all UFO debunkers...	Dr. Donald Menzel (1901-1976) was an influential and politically well-connected astronomer at Harvard University. However, he also has the distinction of being the first famous UFO \\"debunker\\", and he used his contacts within the US government and scientific community to discourage any attempt to treat the UFO phenomenon seriously. In Menzel's view, UFOs were \\"pseudoscientific nonsense\\" and a \\"space-age myth\\". In 1953 he wrote the first-ever UFO \\"debunking\\" book, \\"Flying Saucers\\", in which he attempted to provide prosaic explanations for every major UFO sighting since 1947.     In his second UFO Book, \\"The World of Flying Saucers\\", Menzel offers new explanations for UFO sightings covered in his 1953 book, and he also covers most of the UFO incidents of the fifties and early sixties. Recent research by UFO historians has revealed that Menzel was actually strangely obsessed with \\"flying saucers\\", and also obsessed with humiliating or even threatening anyone who held a different view of UFOs from his own. James Moseley, who has skeptically covered the UFO phenomenon since the fifties, writes in his memoirs that he received playful, detailed drawings from Menzel of \\"Martians\\" and UFO \\"crewmen\\" cavorting with naked alien girls! Edward Ruppelt, a USAF Captain who supervised the Air Force's famed \\"Project Blue Book\\" investigation into the UFO mystery in the early fifties, wrote that in a 1952 meeting Menzel claimed to have \\"all the answers\\" regarding the UFO mystery, but when several scientists openly challenged Menzel's conclusions that all UFOs were hoaxes, mirages, or temperature inversions, Menzel at first \\"hedged his answers\\" and finally \\"blew his stack\\" and stormed out of the room. In 1949 Menzel had his own UFO sighting, which he reported to the Air Force. In his three UFO books, however, Menzel claimed to have \\"solved\\" the sighting as a \\"reflection of the Moon off of haze\\". However, UFO historian Jerome Clark has argued that Menzel actually changed the facts of hisown sighting in order to \\"explain\\" it, and that the details of the sighting he gave in his original AF report don't match his descriptions of the incident listed in his books years later.     In \\"The World Of Flying Saucers\\" Menzel does create the \\"blueprint\\" which would be followed by nearly all UFO debunkers, from the 1960's to the present day. Menzel describes the UFO phenomenon as a \\"myth of the space age\\" - much as witches and fairies were the \\"myths\\" of earlier historical eras. According to Menzel, all UFO reports are explainable as hoaxes, mirages, weather balloons, or some other \\"conventional\\" phenomena. What is particularly striking about this book is that Menzel approaches every UFO case not with the objective eye and open mind of a true scientist, but with the utterly close-minded assumption that, since UFOs can't possibly exist, any prosaic explanation, no matter how far-fetched, is better than admitting that a case is \\"unsolved\\" or \\"unexplained\\". A few examples will illustrate the main thrust of Menzel's debunking approach: in his examination of the Nash-Fortenberry case of 1952, in which two Pan American Airline pilots spotted six strange objects flying in formation over Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, Menzel at first claimed the pilots had seen \\"city lights reflecting off haze, clouds, or humidity\\". When weather records clearly showed that there was no haze, clouds, or other inversion-causing weather, an undaunted Menzel claimed that the two pilots had actually been fooled by fireflies trapped between the panes of glass in their cockpit! When Dr. James McDonald, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Arizona and a prominent Menzel critic, pointed out the absurdity of such a claim, Menzel responded by calling McDonald a \\"pseudoscientist\\" and a \\"crank\\" - without ever specifically responding to McDonald's criticisms of his explanation.     In \\"The World of Flying Saucers\\", Menzel offers several completely different explanations for the Kenneth ArnoldUFO case. Arnold, a successful businessman and private pilot, spotted nine \\"flying disks\\" in Washington State in 1947, and the headlines resulting from his story led to the first great wave of UFO sightings in America. Menzel claims that Arnold either saw a \\"mirage\\" or an unusual cloud formation - yet both of these explanations fly in the face of Arnold's testimony. (In his other two books Menzel offers three additional explanations for Arnold's sighting). Menzel refused to do any field research when investigating UFO cases, and he also refused to personally interview the UFO eyewitnesses. Instead, his solutions came almost entirely from sitting in his home or office and examining the testimony and transcripts of UFO sightings, which possibly accounts for the fact that his \\"explanations\\" for UFO cases often run contrary to the testimony of the witnesses and other researchers. Bottom line: Menzel's \\"The World Of Flying Saucers\\" is worth reading for the simple fact that Menzel is still regarded as the \\"godfather\\" of all UFO debunkers. If you read this book you will find that virtually all other UFO debunking books, such as those of Philip Klass, Robert Sheaffer, and Curtis Peebles, have simply copied Menzel's debunking approach. However, if you wish to read a truly scientific and objective approach to the UFO phenomenon, then you'd be well-advised to look elsewhere.	2004-03-28

Apparently, defending Jerome Clark's \\"UFO Book\\" and pointing out his critic's flaws is \\"evidence\\" that I'm a UFO zealot. Amusingly, I'm accused of \\"mudslinging\\", yet the previous reviewer does plenty of mudslinging himself, calling Clark a \\"crackpot\\" who only uses sources from other \\"crackpots\\", and this reviewer \\"lazy\\". He also didn't respond to many of the points in my other post, but for those that he did, here goes: 1) at no point in his chapter on the Betty and Barney Hill UFO abduction case does Clark say he believes that the Hills were abducted by a UFO. Instead, he simply gives their side of the story, the claims of their critics, and the claims of their defenders. That sounds like a balanced approach to me - you present one side, then the other, and then let the reader decide the truth. In fact, Clark writes in the \\"UFO Book\\" that the Hill case is \\"unprovable\\" and is indeed based on circumstantial evidence! Yet this is ignored by the previous reviewer, who claims that Clark's \\"UFO Book\\" omits anything negative about UFOs. This statement can easily be proven false merely by reading the chapter on the Hill case, in which Clark discusses both Klass AND Kottmeyer's criticisms of the Hill's story. Of course, the real problem here is that Clark doesn't agree with their criticisms, and thus must be a \\"crackpot.\\"<br /><br />2) Phil Klass didn't create his excuse for why he criticized the University of Nebraska for holding a UFO Conference until AFTER his claims had been publicized. In a memo written by the administrator who took Klass's bizarre phone call, Klass charged that he \\"has a personal feeling that...these {UFO} organizations, by publicly questioning the government, lend support to the Communist movement\\". Klass clearly didn't want to simply complain about there being no debunkers (specifically himself) at the conference. Instead, he bluntly equates \\"questioning the government\\" with \\"supporting the Communist movement\\" - an absurd charge. Klass also made this charge privately, and only AFTER it was exposed did he come up with the lame \\"excuse\\" mentioned by the previous reviewer. To use two of Klass's favorite words, how \\"logical\\" or \\"rational\\" is it to equate dissent with supporting Communism? \\"Cry me a river\\", indeed! As for CSICOP's \\"Skeptic Annotated Bibliography\\", the CSICOP website clearly states \\"The Skeptic Annotated Bibliography is NOT sponsored by CSICOP\\". So, who's being \\"lazy\\" here? CSICOP continues to refuse to print virtually anything which is critical of its goals or methods. Just ask noted skeptic Dennis Rawlins, a onetime CSICOP admirer who wrote a hilarious article entitled \\"Starbaby\\" (you can easily find it on the web) in which he describes how CSICOP's leadership (including Klass) tried desperately to cover up a \\"research project\\" into astrology which was terribly botched due to scientific incompetence on the part of CSICOP's \\"investigators.\\"<br /><br />3) So CUFOS, a ufologist group of which Clark is a member, promotes Timothy Good's book in which Good praises UFO \\"contactee\\" and con artist George Adamski? Then why does Clark in his \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" write a devastating critique of Adamski? Could it be that - gasp! - Clark doesn't agree with Good's assessment of Adamski? Apparently the notion that you can agree with a portion of another person's writings and still disagree with other parts is lost on debunkers, who insist that if they can find a single flaw in a ufologist's writings, then he is a \\"crackpot\\" who is no longer to be taken seriously. Of course, they don't apply this same judgment to themselves, as the \\"Starbaby\\" incident noted above proves.<br /><br />4) Ken Arnold sighting: the previous reviewer complains that \\"because there could be multiple explanations, {why do} you have to pick the fantastic one {aliens}\\"? Again, precisely where in the \\"UFO Book\\" does Clark write that Arnold definitely saw an alien spaceship? Can you quote it? What Clark actually does is to tell the story as Arnold told it, and then present the differing sides (as he does in the \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\"). It's called \\"balance\\", which is something that many UFO debunkers and \\"zealots\\" don't seem to understand. Why is it so troubling to debunkers that a UFO case may not have a prosaic, \\"mundane\\" explanation? Most UFO debunkers (as opposed to genuine skeptics) fall into what Dr. J. Allen Hynek used to call the \\"it can't be, therefore it isn't\\" school of thought.<br /><br />And so, finally, the previous reviewer is reduced to complaining about the layout of the \\"UFO Book\\", as if that had any relevance to its contents. The previous reviewer complains that the margins are too wide, there's not enough photos to suit him, and so on, which all very neatly prevents the reviewer from having to write about the book's substance. As to the previous reviewer's claim that the \\"UFO Book\\" \\"has nothing in it\\", my only assumption is that he's never read it. So far the previous reviewer has claimed that the \\"UFO Book\\" contains only \\"25 or so\\" UFO cases, when it actually has at least 60 cases, and numerous others are mentioned in broad chapters. He claims that the \\"UFO Book\\" \\"omits anything negative about UFOs\\", yet that claim is proven false merely by reading Clark's chapter on the Hill UFO abduction case. Also, I'm NOT a UFO zealot. I actually agree with Klass and other debunkers that some UFO cases (such as Roswell) are explainable in conventional terms. However, I also think that Clark and other ufologists are correct in arguing that other UFO cases are as yet \\"unsolved\\" (not aliens, mind you, just unsolved). However, this \\"neutral\\" position is unthinkable in the world of ufology, where close-mindedness is the norm. As a result the UFO \\"debate\\" now revolves around militant debunkers like Phil Klass and Robert Sheaffer at one end, and true UFO \\"zealots\\" like Art Bell and Steven Greer at the other. Jerome Clark falls somewhere in-between these two extremes, which drives debunkers (such as the previous reviewer) nuts. Bottom line: in a field as rife with intellectual dishonesty as this one, Jerome Clark's \\"UFO Book\\" is one of a handful of books to attempt (and usually achieve) a balanced and comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon.

There have been several books published in recent years which argue that the Warren Commission's infamous &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory is correct, and that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone,  did assassinate President John F. Kennedy. However, &#34;Case Closed&#34; by Gerald Posner is easily the best and most reliable of these &#34;anti-conspiracy&#34; books. Posner offers devastating arguments against many of the &#34;loonier&#34; conspiracy theories - such as that Lyndon Johnson or FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had JFK murdered. He also presents detailed arguments against many of the more &#34;respectable&#34; conspiracy theories, such as that Kennedy was killed by the Mafia or by Anti-Castro zealots who were angry at JFK for &#34;abandoning&#34; them during their failed CIA-sponsored invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.  However, I don't believe that Posner has completely &#34;closed the case&#34; on the JFK assassination, and I doubt that anyone will ever solve the case to the complete satisfaction of most people. If you are going to read this book (and I would highly recommend it), then I would also strongly suggest that you read one of the more credible &#34;pro-conspiracy&#34; books for balance, as there are always two sides to every story. In my opinion, the two best &#34;pro-conspiracy&#34; books are Josiah Thompson's &#34;Six Seconds in Dallas&#34;, which is respected even by Posner and most defenders of the Warren Commission; and Anthony Summers's &#34;Not In Your Lifetime&#34;. This book was originally published in 1980 as &#34;Conspiracy&#34;, and it received rave reviews by such prestigious publications as Newsweek, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, and former JFK aides such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. praised it. In &#34;Case Closed&#34; Posner made several stinging criticisms of &#34;Conspiracy&#34;, so Summers responded by writing a completely revised and updated version in 1998 (with the new title) in which he offered detailedrebuttals to Posner's criticisms, as well as making his own criticisms of Posner's statements. I'm not saying that I fully agree with these &#34;pro-conspiracy&#34; books either - I just believe that if you read them, as well as &#34;Case Closed&#34;, then you'll have seen the best and most credible arguments for and against a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.  As for my own personal beliefs, some fifteen to twenty years ago I was convinced that there was a conspiracy, but over the years I have come to believe that it is entirely plausible that Oswald could have killed JFK all by himself, and that the &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory is credible. However, I also believe that there are still enough unanswered questions about the assassination that there will always be some legitimate doubt about whether there was another gunman, and that we'll never be able to state with total finality that the murder of JFK is &#34;case closed&#34;. Bottom line: Posner's &#34;Case Closed&#34; is a detailed, well-written and persuasive argument for the &#34;lone gunman&#34; theory - but make sure that you get the &#34;other side&#34; of the story and read some credible &#34;pro-conspiracy&#34; books before you make a final decision about whether or not there was a conspiracy to kill John F. Kennedy.	2003-12-08
US	45555192	R1NAMMZRU2DOQ9	0425151174	553604651	Watch the Skies!	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	An excellent "Skeptical" History of the UFO Phenomenon...	Curtis Peebles is a noted aviation journalist and historian. In \\"Watch the Skies\\" he presents one of the best historical accounts of the UFO phenomenon that I've ever read. The book begins in 1946 with the sighting of mysterious \\"Ghost Rockets\\" over Northern Europe and then follows the creation of what Peebles calls the \\"Flying Saucer Myth\\" in the USA. In June 1947 a successful businessman and private pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine strange \\"flying disks\\" speeding over Mt. Rainier in Washington State. A baffled Arnold clocked the object's speed at over 1200 MPH - far faster than any human aircraft could fly at the time. His story made headlines around the nation, and soon the \\"flying saucer era\\" was born.<br /><br />Peebles methodically traces the UFO phenomenon from the \\"glory days\\" of the forties and early fifties - a period when even the US military thought there might be something to the UFO mystery and took it seriously - to what he calls the \\"darker myths\\" of the modern era, with its emphasis on alien abductions, government coverups and conspiracies, and the like. A confirmed UFO skeptic, Peebles at least states he's a skeptic at the beginning of the book, and unlike many UFO debunkers (such as Philip Klass, Robert Sheaffer, and other CSICOP-style critics), he is fair and sympathetic to UFO witnesses and UFO researchers. However, he does tend to explain away many baffling sightings and incidents without looking at all the evidence (like many UFO skeptics, he sometimes falls into the \\"armchair investigator\\", or \\"toilet-seat thinker\\" categories). Peebles believes that just as witches and fairies represented the \\"myths\\" of earlier historical eras, so UFOs are a \\"modern myth\\", and he treats the UFO phenomenon as a present-day \\"mythology-in-progress\\".<br /><br />Peebles covers all aspects of the UFO mystery over the past 56 years: the most famous UFO cases, the government investigations and coverups, UFO crashes (such as Roswell), the efforts of leading \\"ufologists\\" and UFO research groups to gain recognition and respectability, the leading debunkers, the \\"contactees\\" and other con artists who have tried to get money and publicity from the UFO phenomenon, the growth of the alien abduction and cattle mutilation mysteries, etc. As someone who has read many UFO books (both pro-and-con), I believe that \\"Watch the Skies\\" is one of the best books on the subject that I've ever read. If you're interested in the history of UFO sightings and cases, but are wary of reading books with dubious stories of alien abductions, cattle mutilations, \\"contactees\\", and the like, then this book will be a delight. It's serious-minded, well-written, and (mostly) well-researched - albeit from a very skeptical point of view. Recommended!	2003-10-26

If I were able, I would actually have given \\"Truman\\" four-and-one-half stars instead of five. It's hard to argue with this book's enormous popularity - when it was released in the early 1990's it received generally rave reviews and became the best-selling presidential biography of the decade. And in most respects \\"Truman\\" deserves the praise it has received. David McCullough is a marvelous writer, as anyone who has read his earlier books (such as \\"Mornings on Horseback\\", his splendid account of the early years of Teddy Roosevelt) can testify. McCullough's research of Truman's life is thorough, and his writing style makes it seem as if you are with Truman on every step of his long journey towards the White House. Truman was the unlikeliest of Presidents, and he may be the last \\"non-millioniare,\\" non-college-educated person ever to serve in the Oval Office. Compared to most of our great Presidents (a rank which Truman is now given, thanks in no small part to this book), most of Truman's life was totally ordinary. He was a farmer who scratched for a living, he adored his wife and was completely faithful to her, he had to put up with a demanding and snooty mother-in-law who thought he was never good enough for her daughter (even after he became President!), and he was a failed businessman who constantly worried about paying the bills. Truman's life didn't really take off until he served as an artillery officer in World War One, and he learned that he could effectively command large groups of men and earn their respect. He subsequently entered Kansas City politics, serving as an honest and efficient county judge (county commissioner) in an otherwise corrupt and despised political machine run by Tom Pendergast, the nationally infamous \\"boss\\" of Kansas City. Truman remained fiercely loyal to \\"Boss\\" Pendergast, even after he was sent to prison for various crimes. Truman would display this trait of loyalty time and again, and while in many ways it was admirable, it would also get him into trouble when his friends sometimes turned out not to be as honest and open as he was. I won't recount Truman's life here, as other reviewers have already done so, but I do have one problem with the book, and that is McCullough's favoritism towards Truman. Although some other reviewers have claimed that this book is \\"even-handed\\", I would argue differently. Truman did have his flaws, but McCullough either glances at them and quickly moves on, or he just ignores the criticisms that others have made. One example involves Truman's racial feelings. McCullough does briefly mention that in his youth Truman often spoke negatively of Jews and Blacks, but argues that he \\"made up for it\\" by pushing civil rights for blacks and helping create the nation of Israel as President. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's \\"conversion\\" to these ideals came in an election year (1948), in which he was the underdog and needed all the minority votes he could get. After Truman left the White House he continued to make occasional negative remarks about racial minorities - in the 1950's and 1960's he criticized Martin Luther King and the civil rights marchers in the South as \\"troublemakers\\", a fact which McCullough never mentions. Also, like most pro-Truman biographers, McCullough makes Truman into the feisty but lovable hero of the 1948 presidential election, when Truman shocked the pollsters and experts to defeat the heavily favored Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's campaign was every bit as negative and divisive as those of later Republican candidates (such as Richard Nixon) who have been much-criticized for their \\"dirty\\" campaigns. Truman, as has been proven by numerous letters, memos, and political memoirs, deliberately made personal attacks on Dewey (such as ridiculing Dewey's mustache and comparing it with Hitler's)  and hurling wild, unfounded charges (in one speech he came close to comparing Dewey and the Republicans with Hitler and the Nazis, a speech which McCullough doesn't mention). Truman's campaign deliberately played upon the fears and prejudices of Democratic farmers and workers (one of Truman's main points was that Dewey and the Republicans would bring back the Great Depression), just as Republicans such as Nixon would later play upon the fears of Republican voters. In my opinion, had Truman been a Republican candidate he almost certainly would today be strongly criticized for his 1948 campaign, but instead he is given the heroic role by McCullough (Truman's opponent Dewey ran a presidential campaign that was a model of what most voters say they want. He refused to reply to Truman's \\"mudslinging\\", almost never mentioned Truman by name, and gave upbeat, optimistic speeches in which he refrained from personal attacks). In spite of these weaknesses, however, \\"Truman\\" is overall an excellent study of how a \\"common man\\" who was no different from your average \\"next-door neighbor\\" became one of the most important Presidents of the twentieth century. As \\"Truman\\" proves, there is a latent greatness in the average, taxpaying, middle-class American citizen - a fact which should provide encouragement if this nation ever again faces the problems and crises which Truman did. Highly Recommended!	2003-10-11

Lee\\" may have been published nearly three-quarters of a century ago, but this abridged version remains the best single biography ever written about the legendary Confederate general. Although there have been numerous books written about Lee, none have come as close to capturing Lee's military genius, or why so many Southerners enthusiastically fought and died under his banner, as does Freeman's work. When it was first published \\"Lee\\" was a sensation, and in the 1930's only Margaret Mitchell's wildly fictionalized \\"Gone With the Wind\\" surpassed it in sales and publicity. Senator Harry Truman read every volume, as did other famous political and military leaders. Freeman's work did much to spread the \\"Lee Legend\\" outside the South and made Lee into a national, and not merely regional, icon. Of course, Freeman has since been criticized, and in some ways justly so, for his overwhelming pro-Lee bias. In Freeman's elegant prose Robert Edward Lee is nearly perfect in every respect - he is a modest, deeply religious man who dislikes slavery and secession but reluctantly agrees to side with his native state of Virginia when the Civil War begins. If the rest of Freeman's story sounds familiar it is because this book made it so. Lee, despite facing constant shortages of men and supplies, meets the overwhelming forces of the Northern States and defeats them in battle after battle. Yet after each defeat the Northerners simply recruit new soldiers, resupply their vast armies, and come after Lee's valiant but shrinking forces again and again. In the end not even Lee's tactical genius can save the outnumbered and outgunned Confederates from eventual (and in Freeman's opinion, inevitable) defeat.<br /><br />Naturally, other historians have not always agreed with this view of the Old South's greatest icon, and later books on the \\"Gray Fox\\" have disputed Freeman's assertions that Lee was opposed to slavery and secession, or that his militarydecisions were always correct. For example, Freeman argues that the South lost the crucial Battle of Gettysburg largely because of the stubborness and jealously of Lee's second-in-command, General James Longstreet. Longstreet had opposed Lee's plan in June 1863 to try and crush the Northern Army of the Potomac by invading Pennsylvania and forcing the Yankees into a final, apocalyptic battle on their own turf. On the second day at Gettysburg Lee ordered Longstreet to have his men attack a small rocky hill, called Little Round Top, which offered a commanding view of the battlefield. Longstreet didn't want to attack such a well-defended position, and instead he tried to convince Lee to simply move around the Northern Army's flank and attack it from behind. According to Freeman, when Lee disagreed with Longstreet's suggestion and ordered him to attack the hill, a sullen Longstreet moved so slowly against Little Round Top that it gave the Yankees time to \\"dig in\\" and repulse his assault. However, more recent historians (as exemplified in Michael Shaara's famed novel, \\"The Killer Angels\\") have claimed that Longstreet was correct in his reluctance to attack Little Round Top, and that Lee should have taken Longstreet's advice.<br /><br />Yet no matter how disputed Lee's strategy or beliefs are in these \\"politically-correct\\" times, this book's elegant prose, flawless research, and passion for its subject shine through on every page. There may have been other books written about Robert E Lee, but none have done so well at potraying his life or in explaining why, even today, his tactics are studied at military academies and his legend continues to thrive in many parts of the South. A genuine \\"must-read\\" for any Civil War buff or student of military history.	2003-10-11
US	45555192	R2UBN2FK7LI0P7	0765341972	21305186	The Mothman Prophecies	Books	2	18	21	N	Y	A Real Disappointment...	As someone who has enjoyed reading about UFOs and other paranormal events while maintaining an open-minded skepticism about them, I was looking forward to reading this classic 1975 book about the bizarre events in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. I had read a few brief summaries of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in other books, and they had usually referred to Keel's book as the standard work on the subject. After seeing the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" film (which is excellent, by the way) I bought a copy of this book. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed in the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\". This appears to be one of those rare occasions where the movie is actually better than the book. Unlike the film, Keel's book has an annoying tendency to go off on tangents - he spends the entire book simply wandering from one story to the next, with no overall theme or focus to tie the stories together.     Keel reminds me of a person who starts one story, then breaks off in the middle and launches into a second, unrelated story, then breaks off the second story and starts telling a third unrelated story, and so on. Much less than half of the book actually deals with the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant. The rest of the book consists of Keel's rather wild-eyed speculations and theories (which he never bothers to support with anything resembling credible evidence) of how UFOs, demons, ghosts, the \\"Mothman\\", \\"Men In Black\\", etc. are all related. Keel repeatedly ridicules the notion that UFOs might be alien spacecraft, and instead he makes the dubious argument that UFOs are \\"projections\\" from \\"energy beings\\" from a \\"parallel universe or dimension\\". Keel recounts several stories of \\"Mothman\\" sightings, creepy phone calls to residents of Point Pleasant, and the like, but he rarely offers any evidence that the stories - or the people telling them - have any credibility.     A couple of examples from the book illustrate how difficult it is to consider Keel to be a serious researcher: in one passage he writes that he helped a couple to contact a UFO by telling them to go outside their home at 9 pm one night and shine a flashlight in the direction of anything \\"unusual-looking\\" in the night sky. Lo and behold, writes Keel, a large orange UFO suddenly appeared over the couple's home, and loud beeps came out of their TV set. Keel then proudly announces that he has given this same \\"insane\\" (his word) advice to many other people, and almost invariably something similar happens: doorbells ring for no reason, UFOs appear over their home, etc. It's nice to know that Keel has discovered a foolproof method for contacting UFOs. In another section Keel describes driving down a lonely road near Point Pleasant and feeling absolutely terrified along the same stretch of highway. After some \\"experimentation\\" (which involved nothing more than walking back and forth over the stretch of road where he feels terrified), Keel announces that his terror was caused by a \\"beam of ultrasonic waves\\". Given that he has no equipment to check for an \\"ultrasonic wave\\", I'm still wondering how he came to that conclusion.     As for the notion that Keel is believable because he does on-site research, simply repeating other people's stories as the absolute truth doesn't qualify as research. Most credible researchers of the paranormal do background checks to try and verify the witnesses' claims, but not John Keel. Instead, he seems to believe that every person he spoke with in 1966 and 1967 is telling the absolute truth, and no further investigation is required. And the more outlandish and eccentric the story, the more Keel seems to trust the witness. I have read numerous books on UFOs and other strange phenomena which have thorough research and references to back up the writer's claims. Do NOT be fooled into thinking that Keel is a serious-minded and objective researcher, as this book is anything but serious-minded or objective. When Keel does manage to focus on the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in Point Pleasant, the book improves considerably. However, Keel's penchant for going off on tangents with one unrelated story after another, and his insistence in focusing upon himself and his theories as much as the \\"Mothman\\" sightings themselves, made this book a real disappointment. If you want to see a first-rate account of the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia, then buy the \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" Special Edition DVD set and watch the excellent \\"Searching for the Mothman\\" documentary contained therein. This fifty-minute documentary, which aired on the FX cable channel, is much more believable and realistic than Keel's book.	2003-10-07
US	45555192	R1UOU54VYXCFI2	0926524585	994096961	Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight for UFO Science (Voyagers)	Books	4	59	60	N	Y	A superb biography, BUT...	Ann Druffel's \\"Firestorm\\" is a serious-minded, scholarly, and well-written biography of one of the most important figures in UFO history: Dr. James McDonald. McDonald (1920-1971), was an atmospheric physicist at the University of Arizona, and was thus perfectly qualified to lead a scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. In the 1950's McDonald had his own UFO sighting, and this experience led him to begin a private, quiet investigation of UFOs that would last for many years. In the early-to-mid 1960's McDonald - who had a \\"top-secret\\" government clearance - gained access to the files of Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. And what he found appalled him: not only was Blue Book's staff scientifically unqualified to investigate UFO's, but the Air Force's hard-line debunking policy had led Blue Book's staff to simply make up many of their \\"explanations\\" for UFO incidents out of thin air, without even a brief investigation or interviews with the eyewitnesses. By the late 1960's McDonald had investigated hundreds of UFO cases - including many from the 1940's and 1950's which the Air Force had claimed to have \\"solved\\" - and offered convincing evidence that the cases were still \\"unsolved\\". He also used his scientific expertise to critique the beliefs of UFO debunkers, such as Dr. Donald Menzel, a Harvard University astronomer and fierce UFO critic. Unlike McDonald, Menzel refused to interview UFO witnesses (since in his view UFOs couldn't possibly exist, any UFO witness was obviously mistaken in their observation and therefore interviewing them was a waste of time). Menzel's \\"armchair investigations\\" of UFO cases were often revealed by McDonald to be unscientific and illogical. Menzel, who was never able to specifically rebut McDonald's scientific and forceful criticisms of his UFO \\"explanations\\", resorted to personal attacks on McDonald, calling him a \\"pseudoscientist\\" and a crank. As Druffel notes, this would become a pattern with McDonald's critics - they would often ignore McDonald's thoroughly-investigated, detailed studies of UFO cases - and would instead concentrate upon attacking him personally.<br /><br />  By 1966 McDonald was convinced that the UFO mystery was real and that it posed a major challenge to science, and so he devoted himself full-time to investigating the phenomenon and to convincing the mainstream scientific community of his beliefs. He quickly emerged as a leading spokesman for \\"Ufology\\" - the scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. In effect, McDonald mounted a one-man crusade to convince his fellow scientists, and the general public, that UFOs were serious business and a subject worthy of scientific study. When the US government created the \\"Condon Committee\\" in the late 1960's to study the UFO phenomenon and see if a final explanation could be found, McDonald eagerly offered his services to the committee. Given his extensive research into the subject and his impeccable scientific credentials, McDonald was a logical choice to serve on the Condon Committee, but he was not chosen as a committee member. The reason for this snub soon became clear, as the Committee's two leaders, Dr. Edward Condon and Dr. Robert Low, were revealed to be hard-line UFO debunkers, and both Condon and Low were determined to have the Committee come to an anti-UFO conclusion, no matter what the Committee's research revealed. McDonald (along with other prominent Ufologists) made fierce criticisms of the Committee's leadership and bias, but to no avail. The \\"Condon Report\\", published in 1969, couldn't find explanations for nearly one-third of the cases it examined, but Dr. Condon in his introduction to the Report flatly stated that UFOs didn't exist and that \\"serious science\\" had nothing to gain from studying the subject. Undaunted, McDonald wrote a number of detailed and thoughtful criticisms of the Condon Report, including his classic essay \\"Science in Default\\", which remains a powerful argument for objectively and thoroughly investigating UFO incidents.<br /><br />  However, the \\"Condon Report\\" marked the beginning of the end for McDonald. His strong and forceful advocacy of UFOs as a serious subject worthy of scientific attention had earned him many critics in the scientific community, most of whom wanted only to ignore UFO cases and disliked having their \\"intellectual laziness\\" on the subject revealed by McDonald. Many of McDonald's scientific colleagues began to avoid him, and he was soon isolated from the mainstream scientific community. Even worse, McDonald ran afoul of Philip Klass, the editor of \\"Aviation Week\\" magazine and an even more vociferous UFO critic than Menzel. When McDonald shredded one of Klass's pet theories for UFO sightings in print - Klass argued that many UFOs were \\"plasma balls\\" caused by power lines, a theory which McDonald showed to have no basis in science - Klass went after McDonald personally in a brazen attempt to destroy his reputation. It was an unfair battle, for while McDonald limited himself to critiquing Klass's theories and \\"explanations\\" for UFO cases, Klass ignored McDonald's scientific arguments and concentrated on personal smears and innuendo - Klass even tried unsuccessfully to have McDonald's top-secret government clearance revoked so he could no longer examine UFO reports, and he privately tried to convince the University of Arizona to revoke McDonald's academic tenure and even fire him. By 1970 McDonald's life was falling apart, partly from his blackballing by other scientists, partly from the vicious personal attacks by Klass, and partly from the fact that his crusade had left little time for his family, and his wife wanted a divorce.<br /><br />  In 1971 came the final blow. McDonald was called to testify before a congressional committee about the supersonic transport (SST) project, an airplane that McDonald had studied and was convinced would harm the atmosphere. Although the subject had nothing to do with UFOs, and McDonald was not speaking on that topic, a sleazy New England Congressman who wanted the SST to be built (because it would bring jobs to the voters in his district) tried to discredit McDonald's criticisms of the SST by turning the hearing to a \\"discussion\\" of McDonald's belief in \\"little green men\\". This tactic caught McDonald completely by surprise, and although he tried to defend his UFO studies and pointed out that UFOs and the SST had nothing to do with each other, the Congressman repeatedly ridiculed McDonald and implied that anyone who \\"believed\\" in UFOs couldn't be trusted with their SST testimony. By the end of the hearing open laughter and ridicule of McDonald could be heard in the congressional chamber. In fact, McDonald's criticisms of the SST were supported by many other scientists and the project was eventually dropped. However, McDonald was personally devastated and humiliated by this totally unfair attack, and later in 1971 he walked into the Arizona desert and shot himself. His death was devastating to Ufology, as it lost one of its greatest leaders and spokesmen. As Druffel notes, many of his investigations and writings (especially his brilliant paper \\"Science in Default\\") remain the best of their kind in the study of UFOs, and have never been adequately rebutted by his critics.<br /><br />  This is a superb, \\"traditional\\" biography, and should be read by anyone with even a passing interest in the UFO phenomenon. Unfortunately, it will probably never receive the attention it deserves, and in many ways \\"Firestorm\\" illustrates the reasons why Ufology has remained a fringe movement since McDonald's death. The book was written by Ann Druffel, and while she has done an excellent job with this biography, she has also published a number of \\"New Age\\" books of dubious merit. One of her books is entitled \\"How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abductions\\", a title which (fairly or not) has received plenty of ridicule. Also, thisbook is published not by a traditional printing house, but by a very small \\"New Age\\" firm - which will unfortunately greatly limit its sales and ability to publicize McDonald's brilliant but tragic career. In short, \\"Firestorm\\" is a superb biography of a very brave, talented, and tragic figure - not only in Ufology but also in American science. It's definitely worth reading, but it's also a shame that so few people will be able to read it, and that the present-day disciples of Menzel and Klass will be able to use Ms. Druffel's previous books to try and discredit this one. Even so, \\"Firestorm\\" is highly recommended. Buy it!	2003-09-29

Hedley Donovan (1914-1990), was the editor of \\"Fortune\\" magazine in the 1940s and 1950s, and from 1964-1979 he was the editor of \\"TIME\\" magazine. In 1986 Donovan decided to write his memoirs, but he presented his experiences in a different format from the usual autobiography. Instead of simply starting out with his childhood and describing his life story from there, in \\"From Roosevelt to Reagan\\" Donovan focuses upon his meetings and personal experiences with each American President he dealt with during his career - from FDR to Ronald Reagan.  Each President gets his own chapter in the book, and in these chapters Donovan offers his personal take on them: their personalities, their strengths and weaknesses, their successes and failures, etc. As one of the professional reviews for this book noted, it's like sitting in a bar and sharing a beer with an interesting old-timer, while listening to him recall the famous people he's dealt with.<br /><br />To his credit, Donovan doesn't always accept the conventional judgments of each President, and readers may be surprised at how he rates them. For example, he judges FDR to have been a failure in trying to end the Great Depression, but a marvelous success in leading America through World War Two. He writes that Truman was a \\"Very Good\\" President overall, but also argues that there was something \\"stubbornly small-bore\\" about Truman that prevented him from achieving true greatness, and one gets the impression that Donovan's personal opinion of Truman was not particularly high. He greatly admires Eisenhower and considers him to be very underrated, and his attitude towards John F. Kennedy is ambivalent. Like most of his journalistic peers, Donovan was fascinated by the Kennedys, but from the beginning he was less-than-impressed with some of their actions, and his opinion of Kennedy is decidedly mixed. Donovan was alternately fascinated, amused, impressed, and appalled by both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, and he argues in hischapters on their presidencies that both men ultimately were failures (he calls them the \\"broken presidents\\"). Donovan extravagantly admired Henry Kissinger, Nixon's powerful and influential National Security Adviser and Secretary of State, and Kissinger is one of the few prominent politicians whom Donovan appears to regard with fawning admiration rather than cool objectivity. Surprisingly, Donovan believes that Gerald Ford was underrated in his time and might have made a good president if he had been elected for a full term in 1976.<br /><br />In the late 1970s Donovan left TIME magazine to serve as a special assistant to President Carter, and he offers several chapters describing his period of service in Jimmy Carter's White House. While he admires Carter, Donovan pulls no punches in describing his political failures. He admires Reagan's \\"public performance\\" as President, but wishes that Reagan had a \\"better mind\\" to go with his superb political skills. Donovan was a well-educated and well-read scholar, and in addition to his chapters on the Presidents he also offers incisive and absorbing chapters which deal with presidential reputations (and how they can fall or rise depending upon the mood of the nation). For example, he describes both how and why Andrew Jackson's historical reputation has fluctuated since he left the White House in 1837. Donovan also offers some suggestions as to how the nation can improve its selection process for presidential candidates (he believes that the current presidential primary system is \\"insane\\"). To sum up, this is a marvelous book, and it offers many unique and personal insights of the presidents and political leaders of the last 75 years. Recommended!	2003-09-21

As you can tell from my Amazon.com name, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi series. Shown on ABC-TV from 1978-79, it was the most expensive sci-fi series aired on television up to that time (it cost roughly $1 million per episode, which led ABC to cancel it after only one season, despite its consistently high ratings). The large and impressive cast was led by Lorne Greene (Pa Cartwright of \\"Bonanza\\"), as Commander Adama, the captain of a huge warship called the Galactica. The Galactica was (presumably) the only human warship to survive a sneak attack by the Cylons, a race of ruthless, single-minded mechanized warriors whose primary mission was to exterminate the entire human race. After destroying humanity's defense fleet, the Cylons then laid waste to the twelve human colonies, killing billions. Under Adama's leadership the survivors of this holocaust gathered together a large rag-tag collection of old spaceships. They set sail for the legendary \\"lost\\" thirteenth human colony, Earth, presumably the last outpost of human civilization in the universe. Of course, the Cylons had no intention of allowing the last remaining humans to escape, and so they began a relentless pursuit of the human fleet, led by a scheming human traitor named Baltar and his sinister android assistant, Lucifer.<br /><br />This novel, \\"The Living Legend\\", is based on one of Battlestar Galactica's most memorable episodes. As the episode begins the Galactica and her fleet of survivors are in desperate shape, as the fleet has nearly run out of fuel, and three Cylon battleships (called \\"basestars\\") are closing in for the kill. However, a fighter patrol led by Adama's son Apollo and his best friend Starbuck are captured and taken to another human warship - the famed Battlestar Pegasus, led by the legendary military genius, Commander Cain (Lloyd Bridges, in a memorable guest performance). The Pegasus was thought to have been destroyed in a battle with the Cylons years earlier, but Cain's military genius had allowed the Pegasus to escape and survive in Cylon-controlled space. Cain is often a hot-tempered, egotistical rulebreaker, and he and the higher-ranking Commander Adama soon butt heads as to who's in charge of the human fleet. But it soon becomes clear to Adama that Cain - for all of his recklessness and refusal to follow orders - is also the only person who can defeat Baltar and the Cylons, capture the fuel supplies his fleet desperately needs, and thus save the human race. This two-part episode featured some great battle scenes (the special effects for the series were created by John Dykstra, who did the FX for the first \\"Star Wars\\" movie), and it is often listed by fans as the single most popular episode of the original series.<br /><br />This short novel, written by \\"Galactica\\" creator and producer Glen Larson, adds a wealth of detail to the episode's storyline, and while I don't expect a TV novelization to resemble fine literature like \\"Cold Mountain\\" or even Stephen King, this novel is surprisingly well-written, and the prose flows smoothly. If, like me, you enjoyed watching the \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV series as a kid, then you'll probably enjoy reading this account of a fondly-remembered episode. Long live the Pegasus!	2003-08-02
US	45555192	R1ZWIV6DD01U4Q	1578590299	278643475	The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial	Books	5	18	22	N	N	A rebuttal to the debunkers...	I don't usually write rebuttals, but in this case I thought I'd make an exception. Jerome Clark (and it's Clark, not Clarke) is no \\"conspiracy theorist\\". The \\"UFO Book\\" is an abridged version of Clark's two-volume, in-depth \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\". In that book Clark does mention Phil Klass, Robert Sheaffer, and other prominent debunkers, sometimes at considerable length. He even includes separate bios of Klass and Donald Menzel, the \\"original\\" UFO debunker. It IS rare for Klass to do any field investigations or to talk directly to the UFO witnesses. Instead, most of his \\"research\\" was done over the phone. As for the \\"rational thinking\\" of Klass & Company, in 1983 Klass tried to shut down a UFO conference at the University of Nebraska by privately telling a school administrator that people who studied UFOs were supporting Communism, and that for the university to sponsor a conference of ufologists would be the same as if they sponsored one held by Nazis! When he discovered that the administrator had released a written account of his absurd claim, an infuriated Klass threatened legal action (which never materialized).<br /><br />Robert Sheaffer, another CSICOP debunker, uses dubious sources such as the \\"National Enquirer\\" on his website (The Debunker's Domain), wherein he attacks not just UFOs, but Christianity, poor people (whose poverty is \\"an inevitable consequence of their achievement-hating values\\"), and \\"radical feminists\\" (and Sheaffer seems to think nearly all women are radical feminists). Sheaffer claims that American women have \\"bamboozled\\" their men into making \\"life-destroying exertions\\" to keep them living in style. Apparently, Sheaffer thinks it's absurd to believe that the government might be hiding evidence of UFOs, but it's OK to believe there's a vast female conspiracy to destroy American men. Go figure. As for the claim that ufologists are in it \\"just for the money\\", debunking is now a big business - CSICOP has more money than nearly all of the \\"pro-UFO\\" groups, such as CUFOS and MUFON, combined. CSICOP has no ufologist literature listed on their website, so it's hypocritical to criticize CUFOS for not listing debunker literature.<br /><br />As for the UFO cases listed below: CUFOS has consistently charged that the Ed Walters sightings and photos are a hoax. Dr. Mark Rodeghier, the Director of CUFOS, wrote one of the first articles \\"debunking\\" the case. There's no need to use the so-called \\"skeptical\\" literature on Gulf Breeze when those supposedly \\"crackpot\\" fellows at CUFOS agree with them! As for Roswell, Clark NEVER claims that a UFO crashed there in 1947. He simply presents the story (including the 1994 Air Force report criticizing the case) and states that the arguments about Roswell are continuing. Karl Pflock's book debunking Roswell was published AFTER the \\"UFO Book\\", so it's unfair to criticize Clark for not using it. The 1890's \\"Airship\\" sightings: Clark has been writing about this subject since the 1960s, and he was one of the first researchers to discover that the 1897 UFO crash near Aurora, Texas was a hoax (it was a prank by the local liar's club). Ken Arnold sighting: there have been no less than 14 different \\"explanations\\" for Arnold's sighting. One would think that if Arnold saw something conventional, there wouldn't be so many different explanations needed to \\"solve\\" the case. And Brad Sparks - whom you apparently admire - had this to say about the debunkers and the Arnold incident: \\"If UFO skeptics can't come up with one good explanation for a sighting, then several lousy ones will suffice\\". Cash-Landrum: Clark quotes from the report of Army Lt. Colonel George Sarran, who investigated the case for the JAG and wrote that Ms. Cash was a \\"credible witness\\" and that he had spoken to other witnesses to the event besides Ms. Cash and Ms. Landrum - that's far more than \\"just using MUFON\\" for source material! Estimate of the Situation: Curtis Peebles writes that General Hoyt Vandenberg rejected the estimate because he felt it didn't make a convincing case that UFOs were alien spacecraft. Clark says the same thing - Vandenberg didn't find it convincing. Exeter: in the \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" Clark does mention Klass and Sheaffer's books in his essay on the case. Falcon Lake: Clark quotes from UFO skeptic Roy Craig's book on his investigation of the case for the Condon Committee. Father Gill Sighting: Clark quotes from both Klass and Menzel's writings on the case. Menzel insists that Gill mistook Venus for the UFO, despite Gill's testimony that he saw both Venus AND the UFO, and Menzel ignores the fact that there were at least 25 other witnesses to the sighting. Klass (typically) accused Gill of simply hoaxing the event, yet he also ignores the 25 other witnesses. Klass came to this \\"solution\\" despite having done no field research or having interviewed any of the witnesses, including Father Gill. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the founder of CUFOS, personally traveled to the Pacific island where the incident occurred and interviewed many of the 25 witnesses. Allan Hendry, a UFO researcher whom even Klass respected, interviewed 6 of the witnesses, and both Hendry and Jerome Clark spoke with Father Gill.<br /><br />Also, the claim that Clark mentions only \\"25 or so\\" UFO cases is absurd - \\"The UFO Book\\" contains 60 actual UFO cases, and numerous others are mentioned in chapters such as \\"Close Encounters of the First Kind\\". The fact that some of these cases are decades-old doesn't mean they're irrelevant (I'm sure many debunkers would like for people to believe they're irrelevant, because then they wouldn't have to give their implausible \\"solutions\\" for some of them). I've read dozens of UFO books (including those of the debunkers mentioned above), and I have no doubt that \\"The UFO Book\\" is one of the best-researched and most reliable works on this controversial subject. Clark even includes a chapter on UFO hoaxes and con artists such as George Adamski. If your mind is already closedon the subject of UFOs (and I mean pro-or-con), then you'll probably hate this book. But, if you're looking for a good reference sourcebook on UFOs, then Jerome Clark's \\"UFO Book\\" is simply one of the best that you'll find, period.	2003-08-01

Allen Hynek (1910-1986), an astronomer at Northwestern University in Chicago. From 1948 to 1969 he served as the top scientific consultant to &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;, the US Air Force's official group which investigated UFO sightings and incidents. What makes Hynek especially credible is that he started out as a debunker - he thought UFOs were &quot;nonsense&quot; and helped the Air Force to debunk most sightings. However, as the years passed he gradually became convinced that some UFO sightings were not hoaxes or misidentified &quot;normal&quot; phenomena such as stars, balloons, meteors, etc. He also became increasingly unhappy with Project Blue Book's highly negative attitude towards UFOs, and in the late sixties he became openly critical of how Blue Book's staff &quot;investigated&quot; UFO reports (in many cases they didn't bother to make even a brief investigation of a UFO sighting - they simply made up an explanation and filed it away). When the Air Force shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, Dr. Hynek founded his own organization to study UFO reports (called the Center for UFO Studies, or CUFOS, it still exists today). He also worked tirelessly - albeit with limited success - to encourage his fellow scientists to take the UFO phenomenon more seriously. In the 1970's Dr. Hynek wrote two &quot;serious&quot; studies of the UFO phenomenon, and both books are today considered to be &quot;classics&quot; in the study of UFOs. The &quot;Hynek UFO Report&quot;, originally published in 1977, offers UFO cases taken directly from the once-secret files of Project Blue Book. Dr. Hynek describes dozens of impressive, hard-to-explain UFO cases that cannot be easily dismissed as hoaxes or mundane phenomena such as birds, balloons, ball lightning, etc. The book is also well-written and Hynek displays a dry wit throughout the text. If you're a serious reader of the UFO phenomenon, then the &quot;Hynek UFO Report&quot; is a &quot;must&quot; for your library, but even if you're a general reader looking to read a good book about UFOs, then the &quot;Hynek UFO Report&quot; presents credible sightings that will hold your attention - and grip your imagination - for hours on end. Highly recommended.	2003-07-08

I wrote the &quot;Great Idea, But Poorly Executed&quot; review of this book some months ago. After recently reading over some of the criticisms of my review, I think many reviewers missed my point. I DON'T necessarily disagree with at least some of Mark Hertsgaard's opinions in &quot;The Eagle's Shadow&quot;. At times Americans can be overly greedy and materialistic, we probably should be paying more attention to our environment, and compared to most of Europe, our political instincts are definitely more conservative and &quot;right-wing&quot;. I don't agree with some of his other statements, but the point of my review was that the subtitle of Hertsgaard's book, &quot;Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World&quot; is inaccurate and misleading. Hertsgaard is essentially guilty of false advertising. I bought this book believing - as the cover title and introductory chapter indicates - that it is an account of how foreigners view the United States. What I got instead was a book with (at most) twenty quotes or comments from foreigners about the USA, and the remaining ninety percent of the book is all about Mark Hertsgaard's opinions of the USA. I'm all for learning about how Europeans, Africans, Asians and Latin Americans view our nation - but I don't really give a flip about what Mark Hertsgaard thinks - if I did, I'd have bought another book. As I wrote in my first review, Hertsgaard should have advertised this book for what it truly is - a platform for his personal (and, yes, generally left-wing) views of America. Maybe Hertsgaard thought that no one would buy a book about his personal views of what ails America - I know I wouldn't have. If your idea of learning about why many foreigners distrust and resent America is to study one guy's opinions on the subject, then by all means read &quot;The Eagle's Shadow&quot;. As for myself, I'd rather hear the comments of, you know, actual foreigners. Not recommended.	2003-05-29

Most UFO books tend to be written by \\"pro-UFO\\" believers who focus on the wilder aspects of the phenomenon (alien abductions, government coverups, etc.), or by so-called \\"skeptics\\" who are often more interested in ridiculing obviously flawed UFO sightings and witnesses than in honestly trying to solve the more baffling cases. Furthermore, few UFO books try to focus on the phenomenon as an historical or social event in American history, and as a result the UFO phenomenon often comes across as a disjointed and disconnected series of sightings, abductions, and bizarre events. David Jacobs, currently a professor of history at Temple University, attempted to correct these mistakes in 1975 when he wrote \\"The UFO Controversy in America\\". This book, which has become a valuable research tool for both believers and skeptics alike, is by far one of the best books ever written on the UFO phenomenon. This is NOT a poorly-researched, \\"wild-eyed\\" book done by a UFO \\"believer\\", nor is it a \\"hatchet-job\\" done by an obvious debunker. Instead, it is a well-written, well-researched, and largely fair-minded look at UFO's as an historical phenomenon.<br /><br />Dr. Jacobs begins by looking at how the UFO phenomenon started in June 1947 with the well-publicized sighting by Kenneth Arnold of nine \\"flying saucers\\" flying in formation near Mt. Rainier in Washington State. He goes on to describe how the US Air Force and military became interested in UFO's and he gives a detailed account of the Air Force's top-secret investigations into the UFO \\"problem\\", which began with Project Sign in 1947, and then went through Project Grudge from 1949-1952 and Project Blue Book from 1952-1969. He gives an excellent account of the controversial \\"Condon Committee\\", which was a government-funded UFO research project at the University of Colorado in the late sixties. Although both UFO believers and skeptics started out with high hopes that the project would provide a \\"solution\\" to the UFO mystery, it quicklybecame bogged down in a nasty feud between those scientists and researchers who took UFO's seriously, and those who did not - including the project's leaders, Dr. Edward Condon and his top assistant, Robert Low. When Dr. Condon made several public remarks ridiculing UFO witnesses and it was discovered that Low had written a letter detailing how the Condon committee would pretend publicly to be \\"unbiased\\" about UFO's while it actually was \\"anti-UFO\\" in private, several of the committee's \\"pro-UFO\\" members quit in disgust and became openly critical of the project's leadership. In fact, the \\"Condon Report\\" (published in 1969), couldn't find explanations for one-third of the sightings it examined, yet Condon in his introduction to the report flatly stated that UFO's didn't exist and that science had nothing to gain from taking the phenomenon seriously. He thereafter became a fierce opponent of any attempt to treat UFO's seriously, and even tried to shut down a symposium on UFO's sponsored in 1969 by the prestigious American Academy for the Advancement of Science.<br /><br />Jacobs also offers a full account of almost every major UFO sighting from the Arnold incident in 1947 through the 1973 UFO \\"wave\\" (which was the last well-publicized series of sightings in US history). Unlike most books on UFO's, Jacobs attempts to be even-handed in his analysis of the subject, and he is critical of both the believers and debunkers at times. The one feature of this book which may surprise some people is that it ignores the famed \\"Roswell\\" UFO case, in which a UFO supposedly crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. In fact, the Roswell case was virtually unknown until the 1980's, and it was the Kenneth Arnold sighting, and not Roswell, which brought UFO's into the spotlight. If you're interested in reading a scholarly, well-researched and well-written history of the UFO phenomenon - the sightings, government investigations, and the people who make up both sides of this mystery - then David Jacob's book is one of the best that's been published. My only complaint is that it ends in the mid-1970's - I wish that Dr. Jacobs would give us an updated version soon. Highly recommended!	2003-05-01
US	45555192	R2W9ZE0ERMP5A1	0879753226	932624962	UFOs: The Public Deceived	Books	3	29	41	N	Y	Yes, it IS debunking nonsense...	Philip Klass (1919-2005) was for many decades the &quot;arch-debunker&quot; of the UFO phenomenon. By day he worked as an editor of &quot;Aviation Week&quot; magazine, but in his free time he &quot;investigated&quot; dozens of previously unsolved UFO cases. As the chairman of the UFO subcommittee of CSICOP, the leading anti-UFO organization in America, Klass became a bonafide hero to his admirers, a &quot;lone voice of reason and science&quot; in the UFO wilderness. He took positive delight in debunking all UFO incidents, criticizing UFO witnesses and researchers as con artists or fantasy-prone people whose judgments were unreliable, and generally arguing that the entire UFO mystery was nonsense. To Klass, there are no unexplained UFO cases - the unsolved cases simply haven't been adequately investigated by UFO &quot;skeptics&quot; such as himself.<br /><br />  Unfortunately for his admirers, such as the posters listed below, Klass was just as extreme, narrow-minded, and flawed in his UFO &quot;research&quot; as those &quot;true believer&quot; ufologists he so loves to critique. While I would freely admit that many ufologists are indeed &quot;true believers&quot; who treat the subject more as a religion than a science, it is also true that Klass's explanations for UFOs are themselves often implausible or run contrary to the known evidence. One famous example is the 1964 UFO case in Socorro, N.M. in which Lonnie Zamora, a respected local policeman, was chasing a speeder when he said he saw a bright flash and heard a loud roar coming from over a nearby hill. When Zamora crossed the hill, he saw a large egg-shaped object with a strange symbol on it, and two men in some kind of spacesuits outside the craft. When they saw him they boarded the craft and it took off, rocking Zamora's patrol car and burning nearby bushes. This case was thoroughly investigated by the staff of Project Blue Book (the Air Force's official group which investigated UFO reports from 1948-1969). Despite Blue Book's strong anti-UFO bias (they debunked sightings as much as Klass), even they admitted that Zamora was an honest witness, that he had seen something strange, and listed the case as &quot;unsolved&quot;.<br /><br />  Klass, however, offered two different explanations for the event - his first explanation was that Zamora had seen some kind of &quot;plasma ball&quot; caused by nearby power lines. However, that theory was shot down by scientists who stated that plasma of the type Klass described was simply impossible to create in such conditions. Undaunted, Klass then claimed that Zamora had lied and that the entire event was a hoax. His proof? That a man who lived only a thousand feet from the UFO landing site hadn't heard any strange noises, so no UFO could have landed. What Klass doesn't mention (and he was notorious for conveniently leaving out any contradictory evidence) is that the man was hard of hearing, he lived next to a busy highway, and that there were strong wind gusts blowing away from the man's house which could easily have drowned out the noise. Klass also claimed that Zamora was put up to the hoax by Socorro's mayor, who owned the land where the UFO sighting took place. Klass claimed that the mayor planned to turn the landing site into a tourist attraction to bring business into the isolated little desert town. However, Klass was wrong - the mayor didn't even own the land as Klass had claimed, and Klass never offered any evidence that the mayor or Zamora hoaxed the event. Additionally, no such tourist trap as Klass described was ever built in Socorro. The UFO landing site remains almost exactly as it was 46 years ago - nothing but desert shrub and cactus, and the rough gravel road leading by the site is still undeveloped. Klass also ignores the fact that there were other witnesses who reported seeing a large, unusual object flying in the desert near Socorro on the day of Lonnie Zamora's sighting, and that the Air Force officer who first arrived at the scene just a few hours after Zamora reported his sighting was later interviewed and stated that he was convinced that Zamora was an honest witness who had seen &quot;something well outside his experience&quot;, and that he had seen the burned bushes and physical damage caused by the object. It is more logical to assume that Klass simply made up his &quot;explanation&quot; out of thin air than to believe he has really solved the Socorro case, especially given his near-total lack of evidence. In addition to Klass, other UFO debunkers have also offered numerous explanations for the Socorro UFO landing, including that Zamora saw a hot-air balloon (James Easton); that he saw a &quot;dust devil&quot; (Donald Menzel); and that Zamora saw an early version of the moon lunar lander (US Air Force). However, none of these debunkers have offered any evidence for their theories either. In fact, one could say that the wide variety of &quot;explanations&quot; is actually evidence that the debunkers have no idea of what really happened to Lonnie Zamora at Socorro.<br /><br />  The Socorro UFO incident is only one of numerous cases in which Mr. Klass offers &quot;explanations&quot; that were as poorly researched and biased as those of the UFO &quot;true believers&quot; whose work he loved to ridicule. In fact, Klass actually did very little field research, and he rarely did interviews with the UFO witnesses. Instead, Klass's research was usually of the &quot;armchair investigator&quot; variety, and much of it was done over the phone from his office in Washington. In short, my problem with Mr. Klass is that he is no different from the people he criticizes - he simply goes to the other extreme. Hopefully, someday the UFO mystery will be examined by experts who will take a fresh and objective approach to the phenomenon. Until then, however, the debate over UFOs will continue to be defined by the two current extremes - those who approach UFO cases with a preconceived beliefthat UFOs are alien spacecraft, and whose &quot;research&quot; not surprisingly indicates that this belief is true; and those debunkers such as Mr. Klass who approach UFO cases with the preconceived belief that &quot;UFOs can't exist, therefore they don't&quot;, and then arrange their &quot;evidence&quot; to prove that point. I have given this book three stars because Mr. Klass does do a credible job of proving that some of the UFO cases he describes do have a mundane, conventional explanation. But, in my opinion, anyone who believes that Mr. Klass is a lonely voice of honesty, reason and open-minded skepticism in the UFO field hasn't seriously examined the evidence. I would recommend that those who read this book also read the works of some &quot;serious ufologists&quot; (and although rare, they DO exist). Among these are Dr. J. Allen Hynek's &quot;The UFO Experience&quot; and &quot;The Hynek UFO Report&quot;, Jerome Clark's &quot;UFO Encyclopedia&quot;, and Leslie Kean's &quot;UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record.&quot;	2003-01-08

Michael Graham - a radio talk-show host and former PR guy for the Republican Party - obviously wants to follow in the footsteps of HL Mencken, Dennis Miller, and Michael Moore as an acid-penned critic of \\"redneck\\" Southern culture. Like these gentlemen, Graham seems to believe that if you can't say something nasty about other people, then you shouldn't say anything at all. Graham grew up in a tiny rural village in South Carolina and, to put it politely, he hated it. This book is filled with every imaginable put-down of white, native-born Southerners. If you read this book you'll get the impression that Southern culture is responsible for everything from the Bubonic Plague to crabgrass in your lawn. And, most of Graham's comments contain nothing that most Southerners (and non-Southerners) haven't heard before - Southerners are still refighting the Civil War, they're racist and inbred, they don't like \\"book learnin\\" and despise intellectuals, etc. Graham's one unique twist on this tiresome refrain is that the South's backward, ignorant \\"redneck\\" ideas have swept the nation - he's as contemptuous of Northern yuppies and California academics as he is of his native region. According to Graham, the South has \\"won\\" the Civil War and Civil Rights battles by successfully exporting its racism, segregation, anti-intellectual beliefs, and \\"irrational\\" religious beliefs to the rest of the nation. For proof, he offers examples such as NASCAR (which, Graham announces with horror, is now the top spectator sport in the country), the \\"politically-correct\\", anti-free speech mindset at universities such as Cal-Berkeley and \\"Hahvud\\", and the growing \\"I am a victim\\" mentality among minorities nationwide, which he claims started with white Southerners after their defeat in the Civil War. Graham even sees the victory of \\"backward\\" Southern ideals in TV shows such as \\"Sex and the City\\", which he claims is basically just the story of Southern-style \\"trailer trash\\" women who happen to live inthe Big Apple (and dress somewhat better). Some of Graham's schtick is admittedly funny, but there's nothing really new here (If you've seen or read Jeff Foxworthy's \\"You may be a redneck if...\\" books or comedy routines, you've seen most of Graham's stereotypes). Graham is also wrong in some of his historical claims - Northern racism wasn't \\"exported\\" from the South, but existed long before the Civil War.  Bottom line: some of this book is funny, but Graham's endless pages of put-downs (of Southerners AND Northerners) gets repetitive really fast, and he adds very little that's new as the book goes along - it's basically one long, Dennis Miller-style rant on the same subject.	2002-12-08

But, in my opinion, nothing equals his chapter on the election-night coverage by the major television networks. If you saw CBS's Dan Rather and his absurd Texas \\"folkisms\\", or ABC's stiff Peter Jennings, or NBC's Tim Russert going berzerk with his magic markers and dry-erase board trying to figure out the electoral college situation, then Barry's spoof of these gentlemen will leave you howling with laughter.

In the prologue to \\"The Eagle's Shadow\\", Mark Hertsgaard - a writer and broadcaster for National Public Radio - states that, beginning in 2000, he traveled around the world interviewing foreigners for their opinions of the USA. His goal was to write a book about how people from other nations view the USA. And, given that the great majority of Americans often don't know much about their own country, much less other parts of the world, it's a worthwhile and timely topic to consider, especially since the tragic events of 9/11 last year. Unfortunately, Mr. Hertsgaard spends far more time giving his personal beliefs regarding how to improve America than actually looking at how foreigners regard the world's only surviving superpower. He starts off each chapter with a few quotes or anecdotes from people he met in Europe or Asia or Africa (for some reason many of his quotes come from South Africa), and then he quickly discards this analysis of foreigner's opinions and instead he begins describing his own beliefs about America in great detail. To cite just one example, in his chapter on the shortcomings of American democracy, he gives a few quotes about how foreigners viewed the 2000 presidential election controversy, and he then spends the rest of the chapter trying to prove that George W. Bush and the Republicans stole the presidential election from Gore. Frankly, I don't care what Mr. Hertsgaard felt about the 2000 election - instead, I wanted to learn how foreigners viewed Bush's election - which, after all, is what \\"The Eagle's Shadow\\" is supposed to be about. By the end of \\"The Eagle's Shadow\\" I knew all I wanted to know (and more) about the author's personal views of America's economic system, environmental record, greed and materialism, crooked politics, and more, but I still didn't know very much about how people from other parts of the world viewed these issues, or whether they blamed America for their own nation's troubles. Hertsgaard is a good writer and his bookcan be witty at times, but overall I felt that he should have advertised this book for what it really is - a platform for the author's personal beliefs about American society and politics - rather than an in-depth exploration of how foreigners view the USA. Out of five stars, I'd give this book two-and-a-half.	2002-10-26

As a native of North Carolina, I can still vividly recall the bitter and dramatic 1984 US Senate campaign between two of the most powerful - and controversial - political leaders this state has ever produced. On one side was Senator Jesse Helms, then running for his third term. Even in North Carolina Helms has always been a divisive figure, and his victory margins have always been in the narrow range. To Democrats in NC and around the nation, Helms is the political version of JR Ewing on the old \\"Dallas\\" TV series - he's the \\"man you love to hate\\". An old-fashioned right-wing conservative, Helms refuses to compromise with his opponents, and he is a master of the politics of \\"divide and conquer\\". However you feel about him, Helms has never been afraid to be as outspoken as possible about his beliefs (adamantly anti-gay rights, anti-abortion, and pro-school prayer and pro-fundamentalist Christian), and he's also one of the few remaining politicians in America who honestly doesn't care what his poll numbers are, or what his critics say about him. He's also a master of fundraising - his 1984 campaign was the most expensive up to that time in US history, as he raised an astonishing $14 million, much of it from out-of-state admirers. Helms is also a living symbol of the transformation of the white South from conservative Democrat to hard-right Republican, a process which began in the 1960's with the Civil Rights movement (Helms was a Democrat until the early seventies).<br /><br />However, in 1984 Helms appeared to have finally met his match in James Hunt, North Carolina's first two-term governor. Although not as well known nationally as Helms, Hunt is also a political legend in NC - he has been elected governor four times, each time by a landslide - and, were it not for his narrow loss to Helms in 1984 he might well have become President in 1992 instead of Bill Clinton. Like Helms, Hunt grew up in a small, rural Carolina town and was raised as a Baptist. But the similarities between the two men end there. Helms never earned a college degree, but Hunt went to NC State University and became a leader in student government. He became a national leader of the Grange (a once-powerful organization of farmers), and he spent several years in the Himalayas of Nepal as an agricultural advisor for the Henry Ford Foundation. In 1972 he was elected lieutenant governor at the tender age of 35, and in 1976 he was elected governor by a record margin. He cleaned up and modernized the state's government, instituted the widely admired \\"Smart Start\\" program for children (which has been copied in many other states), was a pioneer in using standardized tests to measure student progress, and created a powerful political machine with \\"contacts\\" in each of the state's 100 counties.<br /><br />Hunt was easily reelected in 1980, and he started the 1984 Senate race as the favorite. Early in the year he led Helms by double-digits in the polls, and many experts tagged him as the probable winner against Helms. The campaign attracted enormous publicity, as the national and even international media gave extensive coverage to the race. But Helms, relying upon a series of negative yet clever TV commercials, portrayed Hunt not as an effective and popular governor, but as a \\"wishy-washy\\" political opportunist who only wanted Helms' Senate seat so he could run for President someday. Helms also successfully tagged Hunt as being \\"in bed\\" with liberal national Democrats who were too \\"far-left\\" for Tar Heel voters. As election day approached Hunt's big early lead vanished and Helms, who tied himself to President Reagan's reelection bid (Reagan carried NC with 62% of the vote), pulled ahead for a narrow 52-48% victory. As this book by William Snider, the retired editor of the Greensboro \\"News and Record\\" newspaper, attests, the 1984 Helms-Hunt contest had everything - mudslinging and personal attacks, vast sums of money raised and spent by both candidates, personal feuds andgrudges (especially within the state Democratic Party, which hurt Hunt badly), and a series of combative debates which were televised statewide. Although detailed, this book could have used a better editor - there are numerous spelling errors and run-on sentences. However, Snider still presents the best in-depth account of a classic \\"Southern-fried\\" Senate race. Recommended!	2002-10-18

Moseley, now a millionaire, quickly dropped out of Princeton University and decided to use his wealth to pursue his rather eccentric hobbies, most notably UFOs and, later, robbing ancient Incan burial sites in South America of valuable artifacts, either to sell in the USA or simply to keep in his personal collection.    From 1950 until his death in November 2012, Moseley managed to interview, befriend, annoy, or infuriate just about every major or minor person associated with UFOs. He attended all sorts of UFO Conventions, from the serious to the silly (he prefered the silly); in the 1950's and 60's he interviewed con artists who pretended to be &#34;contactees&#34; with aliens; he talked with people who had experienced some of the most famous UFO sightings and encounters (such as Kenneth Arnold and Lonnie Zamora); and he also crossed swords with those whom he sarcastically called &#34;Serious Ufologists&#34; (such as Jerome Clark and Richard Hall). At first Moseley was a strong believer in the theory that UFOs were extraterrestrial spaceships, and he was a &#34;Serious Ufologist&#34; for a few years. He even did the main expose of George Adamski, a con artist and the most famous (or infamous) of the 1950's &#34;contactees&#34; who claimed to be in contact with friendly, humanoid &#34;Space Brothers&#34; who wanted to save the Earth from nuclear war. Moseley clearly had a soft spot for the contactees, and recalls them nostagically in this book, although he was the first to admit that they were either mentally disturbed or simply scam artists looking to make a quick buck from the gullible.    However, Moseley quickly tired of his &#34;Serious Ufologist&#34; role, and after befriending notorious UFO &#34;researcher&#34; and hoaxer Gray Barker, he decided that reporting on the personal lives and infighting of his fellow ufologists was much more fun than doing the grunt work of investigating UFO cases. In 1954 he started a UFO magazine called &#34;Saucer News&#34;, in the early 1980s it was renamed &#34;Saucer Smear&#34; and was the longest-running UFO magazine in the field. From the 1950's until his death in 2012, Moseley used his 'zine to poke fun at the UFO mystery, stir up controversy, and gossip about the private lives of &#34;Serious Ufologists&#34; and what he called &#34;assorted saucer fiends&#34;. Together he and his friend Barker (who pretended publicly to feud with one another) successfully perpetrated several hoaxes on other Ufologists. He also exaggerated or simply made up UFO stories to increase his magazine's circulation. Moseley very quickly became an annoyance to those who took UFO's seriously - such as Donald Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps officer and the leader of the first serious UFO civilian research group, NICAP. Moseley considered Keyhoe to be too pompous and humorless for his taste - as he did most &#34;Serious Ufologists&#34; (he is definitely not one).    Although Moseley claimed to take the UFO mystery seriously, it's difficult to read this book and get that impression. Instead, one gets the feeling that Moseley long ago decided that UFOs were nonsense (but fun nonsense), and therefore anyone who took UFOs seriously must be either incredibly gullible, mentally deluded or a con artist. It is worth noting that Moseley's best friend Gray Barker &#34;pretty much took all of ufology as a joke&#34; (Moseley's words), and after reading this book it's clear that Moseley basically agreed with Barker, despite his denials that he was a skeptic or debunker. Moseley publicly held just about every belief imaginable concerning UFOs over the years, from believing they were alien spacecraft to believing they were supernatural/paranormal in origin, to his vague &#34;4-D&#34; theory, which he held at the time of this memoir's publication, and which he never bothered to explain in any detail. I must confess that I was somewhat dubious about this book. As someone who had read a good deal about UFOs, and who therefore knew of Moseley's history of hoaxes, his large ego, eccentricity, and controversy - as well as his delight in digging up the gossip and &#34;dirt&#34; on UFO researchers and printing it in his 'zine, I wondered just how reliable his personal memoir would be. Well, I was wrong (to a point) - this book is well-written, well-focused (it follows his misadventures from the 1950s to 2002), and it is a delight to read. Moseley (with some help from coauthor Karl Pflock) writes with a breezy, almost jaunty style, and there's no doubt that he pokes some real holes in the reputations of some respected Ufologists.    However, Moseley also comes across in this book as less of a &#34;court jester&#34; than a &#34;class clown&#34; - a rather spoiled and obnoxious rich kid who genuinely enjoyed stirring up controversy for its own sake, who loved being the center of attention and was willing to say or do (or write) just about anything to get it , and who took a real delight out of annoying or irritating other people  - and not always for good reasons. It all makes for an entertaining book, but it's also easy to see why he had so many enemies and critics in the field of Ufology - and to see why this book should be taken with a large grain of salt, despite Moseley's delightfully skewed take on the UFO phenomenon. Recommended, but please don't make this the only UFO book you ever read!	2002-08-08

Although I would not agree that Ronald Story's \\"Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial\\" is the best reference book on UFO's, I would agree that it certainly comes close. Written in an \\"A-to-Z\\" format, this book covers just about every topic which can conceivably relate to the UFO phenomenon - from \\"Alien Abductions\\" to the \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" to \\"Crop Circles\\", and so on. It also has brief descriptions of virtually every major UFO incident in America since the summer of 1947, and it has the advantage of featuring the most recent important UFO cases, such as the famed \\"Phoenix Lights\\" sightings in 1997. However, for me the most impressive part of the book is that it also features detailed biographies of practically every major ufologist and skeptic/debunker in the field. At the end of each biography is a \\"position statement\\" in which the ufologist or skeptic gives his or her personal beliefs about UFO's, or what they might be. Not surprisingly, the skeptic/debunker's \\"position statements\\" are all relatively similar - they argue that UFO's don't really exist, but are simply hoaxes or misidentifications of \\"normal\\" phenomena such as stars, birds, balloons, ball lightning, etc. The \\"position statements\\" of the ufologists does vary, however, with some ufologists believing that UFOs are spacecraft from another planet, while others believe that UFOs are \\"energy beings\\" from a parallel universe, and so on. This book does have one major drawback - most of the articles and essays in the book were not written by Mr. Story, but rather by a hodgepodge of ufologists and debunkers. As a result both the quality and reliability of the essays and articles varies considerably - some are excellent while others are mediocre or skimpy at best. Also, the articles written by debunkers (such as Philip Klass's essay on \\"Alien Abductions\\") are highly critical and negative of the topic being discussed, while other articles written by ufologists are just as \\"pro-UFO\\" and \\"pro-alien\\", which can getconfusing at times. Overall, though, this is still an excellent and detailed one-volume reference book that should answer almost any question about UFOs that you may have. In my opinion, only Jerome Clark's massive two-volume \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" is superior to this book. Recommended!	2002-07-31

This book is a completely revised and updated version of Anthony Summers's classic \\"Conspiracy\\", which was published in 1980 following a congressional committee's findings that there was a conspiracy to kill President John F. Kennedy. When it was released \\"Conspiracy\\" won rave reviews from such prestigious publications as Newsweek, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, and former Kennedy aides such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Pierre Salinger praised Summers for his thorough research and sensible approach to the problem. It also won the coveted \\"Golden Dagger\\" award as the best \\"true crime\\" book of 1980. Although there have been many \\"pro-conspiracy\\" books written on the Kennedy assassination, this book is BY FAR the best-written, most reliable, and most persuasive. Summers, a respected investigative reporter for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), did an exhaustive, years-long investigation into the Kennedy assassination. In this book he presents the various groups in America which had a good reason to try and kill Kennedy in 1963 - the mafia, the anti-Castro forces, rogue government agents, and of course Lee Harvey Oswald himself - and then presents the evidence he found for a conspiracy. Wisely, Summers doesn't advocate any single theory - he simply presents the evidence and leaves it to the reader to decide. The result is easily the best single-volume \\"pro-conspiracy\\" tome on the JFK assassination, and if you could only read one \\"pro-conspiracy\\" book this should definitely be it. However, there are always two sides to every story - and I would also strongly recommend reading Gerald Posner's \\"Case Closed\\" to get the single best \\"anti-conspiracy\\" book. After reading \\"Not In Your Lifetime\\" and \\"Case Closed\\" you will have seen the best and most persuasive arguments for and against a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Highly Recommended!	2002-06-12

Heymann has done an impressive amount of interviews with people who knew Jack and Jackie well, and while some may argue with his interpretation of certain events, there's no doubt that he's done his homework. This book follows Jackie from her surprisingly unhappy childhood, which was marked by an ugly divorce between her dashing yet womanizing and big-spending father and her uptight, social-climbing and rather cold mother. Jackie was a definite daddy's girl - she adored her father and never seemed to care too much for her mother or the second man she married, wealthy stockbroker Hugh Auchincloss.<br /><br />Thereafter comes the now-familiar story - she grows into a beautiful and sophisticated young woman (who emphasizes her father's French ancestry and all but ignores her mother's Irish heritage), attends the best women's private schools in America and France, becomes engaged to a nice yet boring young stockbroker; but then suddenly breaks off the engagement when she begins dating a sexy and exciting US Congressman who just happens to come from a VERY wealthy family - John F. Kennedy. Then comes the high-society wedding, the rocky marriage (made so by Jack's constant cheating and Jackie's expensive shopping sprees and snobbery towards her Kennedy in-laws), her glamorous tour as First Lady in the early sixties, the horror of JFK's assassination, and finally her controversial marriage to the ultra-wealthy yet crude Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Although Heymann tries to be fair and objective to Jackie, his book does seem to emphasize the dark sides of this charismatic couple, and those people who still have a romantic view of John and Jacqueline will find this book to be disturbing. Yet while she had her flaws, there's no denying her now-legendary poise during her husband's funeral or her admirable role in raising her two children to be the decent and well-mannered people they turned out to be. Overall, this is an engrossing \\"warts-and-all\\" biography of one of the most famous women of the 20th Century. Recommended!	2002-06-12

Ralph Martin's \\"A Hero for our time\\" is simply one of the best-written and most engrossing accounts of John F. Kennedy that I have read. Despite its' length the book goes remarkably fast, and I finished it in just a few sittings. However, this book is NOT an in-depth, traditional biography of John F. Kennedy's political career, and those who want to read more about the great events of JFK's political career would be well-advised to look elsewhere. Instead, this is an \\"oral biography\\" of JFK's life from childhood forward. Martin interviewed dozens of Kennedy's closest friends, relatives, and political aides to present a vivid account of what Kennedy was like as a person - and of what it must have been like to know him personally, or to work for him. The result - as one of the newspaper reviews above accurately states - is like getting the \\"People\\" magazine or A&E's \\"Biography\\" version of the Kennedy saga. While often factual and well-researched, this book is also filled with gossip - which, while juicy and fascinating - should also be taken with a grain of salt. Martin includes all aspects of Kennedy's personal life - his sickly childhood on Cape Cod, his wild bachelor days, his courtship of the beautiful and aristocratic Jacqueline Bouvier and the Royalty-style wedding, his sometimes-troubled marriage to Jacqueline, his many extramarital affairs, his serious health problems, etc. But Martin does include more weighty material, such as Kennedy's relationships with his father, his brothers Robert and Teddy, and the inner workings of the family's remarkable political machine which in 1960 \\"beat the odds\\" to make him our youngest elected President, and the first (and only) Catholic to become President. This book's strengths lie in its' ability to present what JFK the man must really have been like - the eloquence, intelligence, wit, the ability to have fun (and get others to share in it), and the movie-star glamour and charm are all here. The book's weaknesses lie in its' reliance on gossip for some details, and in the way it skims over the details of JFK's political career without ever going in-depth. However, in my opinion this book's strengths far outweigh its' weaknesses, and if (like me) you're too young to have any memory of the Kennedy Presidency and wonder why he was considered to be so exciting, charming, and charismatic, then this book will help you to understand why.

With the release in April 2002 of \\"Master of the Senate\\" - Caro's 3rd volume of his epic 4 volume study of Lyndon Johnson, we can finally see \\"Means of Ascent\\" - his controversial 2nd volume, in its' true context. When Robert Caro started researching this biography of LBJ more than a quarter-century ago, he went far beyond what most biographers and historians do in examining his subject. He literally spent years living in the isolated Texas Hill Country where Johnson was born and raised, and in the process he acquired a level of knowledge about LBJ's life that makes other biographies of the man pale in comparison. So thorough was Caro's research that even his critics - historians such as Robert Dallek, who complained that Caro was being too harsh in his \\"interpretation\\" of LBJ's character and rise to power - didn't dare dispute Caro's findings or research. When \\"Means of Ascent\\" was published, the chorus of critics grew even louder. They complained that Caro was \\"hopelessly biased\\" against Johnson, and that he had made LBJ the \\"villain\\" of his story - even while he made a \\"hero\\" out of Texas Governor Coke Stevenson, LBJ's opponent in the fiercely contested 1948 US Senate election. Many of Caro's critics pointed out that Stevenson was a segregationist - yet they failed to mention that Johnson was also a segregationist at that point in his career. Additionally, Caro's critics also claimed that even if LBJ \\"stole\\" the 1948 Senate election, it was \\"justified\\" because of what Johnson later did for civil rights and other liberal causes in the Senate and Presidency. Given that we live in a democracy where the \\"people\\" are supposed to rule, this is indeed a strange argument! \\"Means of Ascent\\" focuses upon what Caro calls the \\"worst years\\" of LBJ's political career - the 7 years from 1941, when Johnson narrowly lost a Senate race due to vote-fraud by his opponent - to 1948, when Johnson wins an even closer race for the Senate by doing some vote-stealing himself. During theseyears all of Johnson's \\"darker\\" sides were on display, and few of the \\"better\\" aspects of his personality managed to surface. After promising his supporters to resign as a Congressman and serve in the military when World War Two begins, LBJ then tries desperately to avoid military service. When he is finally forced to serve, he makes sure to land a job as an intelligence officer well away from the front lines. He finally does agree to go on a single bombing mission over a Japanese base, sees fifteen minutes of combat - and is promptly awarded the Silver Star, the US Army's 3rd-highest medal. After returning to Congress, he uses his political connections to arrange some rather unethical business deals that transform him from being literally \\"dirt poor\\" to a multimillionaire in just a few years! However, most of \\"Means of Ascent\\" is taken up with describing the epic 1948 US Senate race. The heavily favored candidate was Coke Stevenson, the reserved, pipe-smoking, and extremely popular \\"Cowboy Governor\\" of Texas. Stevenson still holds the record of being the ONLY Texas politician to carry all of Texas' counties in an election, and his popularity was so great that he was nicknamed \\"Mister Texas\\". Caro doesn't shy away from pointing out that Stevenson was a segregationist and a small-government conservative who believed in low taxes and few public services - but he also points out that these stands were highly popular with most Texas voters. Lyndon Johnson, desperate to escape his \\"dead end\\" role as a junior Congressman, challenges Stevenson in the biggest gamble of his career. Caro brilliantly describes the contrast between the older Stevenson - a genuine laconic cowboy right out of a Gary Cooper or John Wayne western, a man who campaigns the \\"old-fashioned\\" way by leisurely driving from one small Texas town to the next and shaking hands on courthouse squares - and Lyndon Johnson, a young man of frantic energy and determination who used a helicopter (just being introduced in 1948) to fly from one town to the next. Johnson would fly over the town's main street, lean out of the cockpit with a bullhorn to attract a crowd, and would then land (sometimes on the street) and give his speech. Campaiging himself to total exhaustion and driving his staff mercilessly, LBJ steadily gains on Stevenson as election day approaches. Yet, (as Caro clearly shows) LBJ's efforts still weren't enough - as Stevenson \\"wins\\" the race by less than 200 votes. However, almost a week after the election, the notorious George Parr - the corrupt and brutal \\"boss\\" of Duval County along the Mexican border in south Texas - suddenly reports a \\"corrected\\" list of votes from precinct 13. Johnson gains 202 votes and pulls ahead. Convinced that the election has been stolen - Stevenson and a close friend, legendary Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, travel to the town of Alice and insist upon looking at the list of voters from precinct 13. According to eyewitnesses, the list clearly had 200+ names added - in a different-colored ink and in alphabetical order - at the bottom. With this evidence Stevenson attempts to challenge LBJ's \\"victory\\" in court, but Johnson uses his political contacts in Washington - and a brilliant lawyer named Abe Fortas - to get the hearing stopped just before the judge made a ruling (the judge later said he would have ruled in Stevenson's favor). And so - by the highly tainted margin of 87 votes - Lyndon Johnson goes to the US Senate. This victory would haunt the rest of LBJ's political career, and even many of Johnson's admirers admit that it cast doubt over whether Johnson should ever have been a Senator - or President of the United States. Given the overwhelming evidence Caro presents, there's no doubt that the \\"wrong man\\" won the 1948 Senate race (at one point Caro shows a photo of Parr's cronies standing around the Precinct 13 voting box, and they're all grinning. President Johnson kept the photo hidden in a White House closet). Yet despite Johnson's attempts to keep the real story of the 1948 race hidden from the public, Robert Caro discovered the truth and has given us an unforgettable description of an election that reads like a real-life soap opera and morality tale.

Published in 1962, \\"Six Crises\\" by Richard Nixon is easily one of the best-written and most interesting books done by a US President. This book was a bestseller and even today it is regarded as a worthwhile read, largely because of its' insights into Nixon's mind and character. Fittingly, the book isn't an autobiography or a political memoir; instead it focuses upon what Nixon considered to be the six greatest moments of his political career up to 1961.<br /><br />The first crisis is the infamous \\"Hiss Case\\" in 1948, which elevated Nixon - then an unknown junior Congressman - into national prominence for the first time. The case started when Whittaker Chambers, a Communist turned Anti-Communist magazine editor, accused Alger Hiss, a high-ranking diplomat in the State Department, of being a Communist spy who had passed American military and scientific secrets to the Soviets. The Hiss spy case became a national sensation and shocked the country, and Nixon - a member of a congressional committee investigating Communist activities in the U.S. - became famous by questioning Hiss in dramatic congressional hearings, and in 1950 he used the case as a springboard to the U.S. Senate. The second crisis occurred during Nixon's first Vice-Presidential campaign in 1952, when he was accused by the press of being a crook who took bribes. Eisenhower considered forcing Nixon to resign as his running mate, but Nixon saved his career with the famous \\"Checkers\\" speech on national television (Nixon prefers to call it the \\"Fund\\" speech). The third crisis happened in 1955 when President Eisenhower had a serious heart attack, and until he recovered Vice-President Nixon had to be the \\"acting President\\" for a few weeks - a delicate task, but one Nixon performed quite well. In 1958 Vice-President Nixon and his wife Pat made a \\"goodwill\\" tour to South America, but were attacked and nearly killed by pro-Communist mobs in Venezuela - thus the fourth crisis. The fifth crisis came a year later whenNixon went to Moscow, where he engaged in a famous debate with Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev in a mock American \\"kitchen\\" that had been set up to show Russians how the ordinary American family lived. Although the debate was heated, most observers felt that Nixon had gotten the better of Krushchev.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book for me was the last crisis - the legendary 1960 presidential campaign between Vice-President Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy. Nixon offers a well-written account of his view of the campaign. What really makes this book fascinating is what it reveals about Nixon the man - his emphasis on handling \\"crises\\", his obsession with maintaining his self-control during these crises, and the way in which he seems to place \\"events\\" above people - when talking about the mobs who attacked his limousine in Venezuela, he barely mentions his wife, who was also in grave danger - instead he focuses upon his own reaction to the attack and analyzes his own reaction to the mobs. In this book Nixon tries to present himself as a calm, cool, and rational man who always makes the best decisions - yet as his Presidency (and especially Watergate) would show, the \\"real\\" Nixon was often very different from the unemotional and logical figure presented in this work. Even so, this book is still a worthwhile read - it is very well-written and it examines several of the greatest events of a major politician's career from his personal perspective.

Whether you're liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, the one thing we all have in common as Americans is the right of free speech. Over the decades extremists on both sides - liberals and conservatives - have tried occasionally to intimidate or even oppress those who dare to hold different ideas from their own. The Salem Witch Trials and the infamous \\"Red Scare\\" inspired by Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950's are just two of the better-known examples. In \\"Death by Journalism\\", Jerry Bledsoe, the bestselling author of true crime books such as \\"Bitter Blood\\" and \\"Blood Games\\", takes aim at a case of \\"political correctness\\" run amok in his own hometown. A native of rural Randolph County, North Carolina, in the middle of the state, Bledsoe has retained strong ties to his native region. He once worked for the Greensboro News and Record, which serves nearby Randolph County and which is one of the state's largest daily newspapers. Although Bledsoe enjoyed working for the paper years ago, he argues in this book that the N&R - like so many other papers across the nation - has been taken over by people who wish to shove their own political views down everyone else's throats, and who care little for the \\"old-fashioned\\" notions of fairness and journalistic ethics.<br /><br />In \\"Death by Journalism\\" Bledsoe exposes a truly frightening story - that of Jack Perdue, an ordinary, well-meaning, middle-class fellow who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. A local historian and Civil War buff, Perdue also happened to be a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), a Civil War \\"re-enactors\\" group dedicated to \\"preserving Southern heritage\\" as it related to the war. Although the SCV has been controversial, Bledsoe proves beyond all doubt that Perdue was no racist, but simply a guy who loved Civil War history and loved talking about the battles, the armies of both sides and the generals who led them. The trouble started when Perdue was hired by thelocal community college to teach a course in Civil War history. However, before long an ambitious and politically-correct reporter for the News & Record went to the class unannounced. According to the students, as well as Perdue, the reporter got into a shouting match with some of the students and angrily left. He then wrote a bogus article for the News & Record in which he accused Perdue of defending slavery and claiming that slaves were \\"happy\\" on Southern plantations, and other racist comments. Bledsoe, through interviews with students who took the class and college administrators, and through an examination of the course syllabus and Perdue's lecture notes, proves beyond a doubt that Perdue never taught that slavery was justified (he actually said the opposite), nor made any of the other claims the N&R reporter accused him of.<br /><br />But the News & Record's vendetta didn't stop there. Columnists for the N&R ridiculed the entire county, claiming that Perdue's \\"racist\\" views (which, of course, the reporter had fabricated) were shared by almost all of Randoph County's white population, and that the people of Randolph were all a bunch of backward, ignorant redneck hicks. The story by the reporter was picked up by the Associated Press and printed nationwide and even overseas, causing a firestorm of controversy to descend upon the quiet little community college. Perdue and the school tried to defend themselves, and pointed out the reporter's \\"lies\\", but no one in the media even tried to double-check the \\"facts\\" in the article. Perdue himself was so stressed and personally devastated by the controversy that he suddenly died of a heart attack - Bledsoe basically accuses the News & Record of indirectly killing him. Given the falsehoods the paper deliberately spread about him, this does not seem to be an unfair assessment. To this day the News & Record has never admitted to a \\"mistake\\" in allowing the article to be printed (they did indirectly admit to their guilt when they \\"disciplined\\" the reporter for another \\"problem\\" several years later), nor has it apologized to the family of the late Jack Perdue. The point of Bledsoe's story is not to defend the Sons of Confederate Veterans, or even to defend Perdue's class (harmless and non-racist though it certainly was), but to point out how a large newspaper with no ethics or standards of fairness can easily subvert the practice of free speech and destroy lives. Whether you're a liberal or a conservative, or simply a concerned citizen, \\"Death by Journalism\\" should be considered a \\"must read\\" - an engrossing, highly convincing, and very disturbing story that is far more chilling than any of Bledsoe's \\"true crime\\" books.

US	45555192	R2BS7RZELF1H0G	0380814706	614134562	Invasion Washington: UFOs Over the Capitol	Books	4	9	9	N	N	A Superb Analysis of the Washington UFO "Invasion" of 1952!	Dr. Kevin Randle has researched the UFO mystery for nearly a quarter-century, and he's earned a reputation as one of the few \\"ufologists\\" to be taken seriously. Unlike many UFO \\"fanatics\\" who do little research and who treat every UFO sighting as \\"proof\\" of alien visitation, Randle does thorough, objective research and openly admits that he's skeptical of many UFO reports (and he's highly skeptical of all UFO \\"abduction\\" reports). However, Randle, a former Air Force Captain, also doesn't believe that the testimony of thousands of reliable, competent UFO witnesses can simply be dismissed; and that the \\"physical evidence\\" of UFO sightings - radar traces, photographs, burn marks on the ground - does provide some \\"proof\\" that the UFO mystery is real and not fiction. \\"Invasion of Washington\\" is one of Randle's finest and most persuasive books to date. Reaching a half-century back into UFO history, this book focuses on what may be the single most important UFO case in American history. On two consecutive Saturday nights in July 1952, dozens of strange lights were seen above the nation's capital. Even more importantly, the objects were also detected by radar at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base at the same time. Radar experts in both radar centers confirmed that the strange objects were \\"solid targets\\", and a worried Pentagon even ordered jet fighters to intercept the UFOs. Weirdly, when the first few fighters arrived, the UFOs all vanished AT THE SAME TIME - they all disappeared off the radarscopes! However, when the fighters ran low on fuel and left, the objects just as suddenly returned - convincing the observers in both radar centers that the objects were under intelligent control. Eventually, however, at least one of the fighter pilots was \\"surrounded\\" by the strange lights, which then took off at fantastic speeds away from the fighter. The \\"Invasion of Washington\\" made front-page headlines in newspapers around the nation, and President Truman even called the head of the Air Force's Project Blue Book - the top-secret group investigating UFO sightings - to ask what was going on. With Blue Book being swamped by UFO reports (more UFOs were reported in 1952 than in any other year in US history), a concerned Air Force held a press conference at the Pentagon - the largest since World War Two - to address the issue. General John Samford dismissed the UFO sightings as \\"mirages\\", and the radar traces as \\"temperature inversions\\" - but never offered any evidence for these explanations. Randle easily disproves both theories - there were numerous \\"temperature inversions\\" throughout the month of July 1952, yet these two nights were the only times that visual sightings were made of UFOs, and radar operators in both radar centers noted that the UFOs were \\"strong, solid\\" blips, while the temperature inversions recorded on the radarscopes were weak returns which the operators easily filtered out. He also offers compelling evidence that the Air Force pressured both military and civilian pilots into changing their stories to \\"go along\\" with the \\"mirage\\" explanation (excuse). He describes both how and why Project Blue Book's mission changed after July 1952 - going from a talented and serious-minded organization dedicated to objectively investigating UFO sightings, to an understaffed group dedicated to debunking and explaining away every UFO sighting it received. For a UFO buff this book is a \\"must\\", but it also is an engrossing account of the UFO incident which possibly provides the strongest \\"evidence\\" that UFOs are real objects, and not simply hoaxes, hallucinations, or misindentifications of stars, planets, meteors, etc. Highly recommended!	2002-04-13

Kennedy was surely among the most glamorous and photogenic. During his brief but dramatic political career dozens of the nation's best photographers were paid to capture him, his beautiful young wife, his children, and his remarkable brothers and sisters on film. The result has been dozens of &quot;coffee-table&quot; photo books on the Kennedys. However, this older book, published in the sixties not long after JFK's assassination, is among the best that I have seen. Unlike many Kennedy books, which focus mainly on Kennedy's Presidency and/or political career, &quot;As We Remember Him&quot; is much more balanced, and follows JFK from his childhood, through prep school, college and World War Two. The photos are lovely and very well-done, and the book also has two more advantages: the photos are accompanied by quotes from Kennedy friends, relatives, and associates from childhood forward; and the book contains several reprinted newspaper articles concerning JFK, from his heroism in World War Two to obituaries of his beloved older brother and sister; and letters from Senator and President Kennedy to friends and the public. The result is a very balanced and interesting look at Kennedy the man - father, husband, politician, and President. Highly Recommended!	2002-04-05

Dr. Kevin Randle is one of a relative handful of UFO investigators who deserves to be taken seriously. A retired Air Force Captain, Randle has spent over a quarter-century investigating UFO sightings, and he has earned a reputation for thorough research and objectivity that is rare in this field of study. Unlike many UFO \\"True Believers\\" who treat the subject as a religion and who seem to believe that every UFO sighting is \\"proof\\" of alien visitation, Randle isn't afraid to admit that many sightings are hoaxes or otherwise explainable as \\"normal\\" phenomena (Birds, Stars, Ball Lightning, etc.), and he is highly skeptical of all UFO \\"Abduction\\" reports. However, Randle also believes that the testimony of thousands of competent, reliable, and often well-trained UFO witnesses cannot simply be ignored, and that some UFO sightings are indeed baffling and worthy of serious study by qualified scientists. In \\"Project Blue Book Exposed\\", Randle presents one of his best books to date. \\"Project Blue Book\\" was the code name for the US Air Force's top-secret investigation of UFO sightings from 1947 to 1969, when it was shut down. At the time the Air Force claimed that its' 22-year investigation had revealed that UFOs were simply hoaxes or natural phenomena, and that UFOs were not from outer space and posed no threat to national security. However, as Randle makes painfully clear in this book, the Air Force's claims were false and misleading. Randle finds dozens of unexplained cases in Blue Book's files, and he discovers that the pressure on Blue Book's staff to explain away every sighting led to the staff often \\"making up\\" explanations for sightings out of thin air, without even a brief investigation or interviews with the eyewitnesses. As Randle makes clear, some of the Air Force's \\"explanations\\" of various UFO sightings were themselves scientifically implausible, or ran contrary to the evidence contained in the files. Beginning with Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting in June 1947that \\"started\\" the UFO Phenomenon in America, Randle takes several of the most famous UFO cases contained in Project Blue Book's files and re-examines them. His conclusion is that, contrary to Air Force claims, Project Blue Book actually offered strong, convincing evidence that UFOs ARE real, and that something strange was going on in America's skies in the forties, fifties, and sixties, and may still be continuing even today. If you're a UFO \\"buff\\", then this book should be a \\"must\\" for your personal library, but even if you're a general reader you'll find \\"Project Blue Book Exposed\\" to be an insightful and informative account of an important government investigation whose findings  - if they are correct - could help answer one of the greatest mysteries of our time.	2002-04-05

I read Kevin Randle's book several years ago, and I found it to be far more serious-minded and thoughtful than most UFO books, whether pro-or-con. Randle is no wild-eyed UFO \\"nut\\" who believes that every UFO sighting is \\"proof\\" of alien visitation (he is actually highly skeptical of all UFO \\"abduction\\" reports). But Randle does believe that the testimony of thousands of competent, often well-trained eyewitnesses (such as pilots, military officials, scientists, etc.) cannot simply be ignored. And, as a reply to the gentleman below, I thought I would make the following observation: 1) \\"Ufology\\" IS a legitimate word, and is included as such in the \\"American Heritage Dictionary\\". Only someone who has never bothered to read a dictionary would fail to realize this fact. 2) UFOs ARE a mystery precisely because we don't know what they are...which is the very definition of a mystery! To claim that UFOs are simply ordinary objects which haven't been identified yet is simply absurd...as anyone who has actually read Randle's books (or those of other credible UFO researchers) soon discover. When the US Air Force was in the business of investigating UFOs in the 1940's and 1950's, they discovered that the more impressive the witness and the longer the sighting, the more likely the \\"UFO\\" was to remain UNIDENTIFIED. If all UFOs were merely ordinary objects which were/are misindentified, then logically the more time you have to view the object - and the more qualified the eyewitness - then the more likely it is that the person would be able to \\"identify\\" the UFO as something ordinary. Instead, the Air Force found that the precise opposite was true. Hmmmm...I wonder if the critics of most pro-UFO books actually bother to read them?	2002-02-28

Suzanne White's \\"New Astrology\\" actually combines two of the oldest forms of astrology into one simple format. She takes the animal symbols of Chinese astrology (Horse, Rooster, Goat, etc.) and combines it with the traditional symbols of Western astrology (Scorpio, Virgo, Pisces, etc.) For example, if you were born in late October-November 1966, you'd be a Scorpio/Horse. White is one of the most entertaining astrological writers around, and her breezy style is a nice contrast to the vague and often plodding writing style of many astrologers. Unfortunately, she isn't one of those people who believes in holding anything back, and unlike many astrologers she does seem to believe that some signs are simply better (luckier, tougher, sexier, etc.) than others. Woe be to you if you are a male goat (White admits that she has a grudge against male goats), and after reading White's take on them you may often wonder how these poor men manage to get through a single day without having a nervous breakdown. On the other hand, if you were born a snake, then life must be a bowl of cherries. My chief complaint with this book - as with most of White's other books - is her incessant need to talk about herself and her \\"scads of friends\\" in almost every chapter. It seems as if White isn't satisfied unless she mentions every famous movie star or writer whom she's known over the years, and this name-dropping gets pretty old after awhile. However, if you've got a thick skin and you don't mind reading about Ms. White's famous \\"Leo/Dog, Capricorn/Ox, Cancer/Dragon\\" friends and relatives, then this book can provide you with many hours of fun and entertainment. Recommended.	2002-02-23
US	45555192	R3F1X2LSOSJ0AB	0679729453	933385853	The Path to Power (The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Volume 1)	Books	5	104	111	N	N	One of the greatest biographies of our time...	This book, published in 1982, has already achieved a legendary status among history and political buffs. When it was released its author, Robert Caro, won enormous acclaim for his unprecedented research and engrossing writing style - and plenty of criticism for his harsh and unsparing portrait of Lyndon Johnson. Caro literally spent years living in and interviewing people in the arid Texas Hill Country where Johnson was born and raised, and in the process he acquired a level of knowledge about his topic that few other biographers even approach. Like William Manchester's \\"Last Lion\\" biographies of Winston Churchill, \\"The Path to Power\\" is far more than a simple biography of the young Lyndon Johnson's desperate desire to escape the grinding poverty of rural Texas in the 1930's and achieve power in Washington. Caro writes unforgettably of the Johnson family, the culture and history of the Texas Hill Country, the incredibly corrupt political system in Texas at the time, and of how Johnson both brilliantly and cynically manipulated that system for his own purposes. Caro's descriptions of the people in LBJ's life - from his mother to his wife Lady Bird to fellow Texan Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives and Johnson's mentor in national politics - are superb and detailed.<br /><br />However, Caro's unsparing portrait of LBJ as a power-obsessed liar and bully who would stop at nothing to succeed greatly offended many of LBJ's associates whom Caro had interviewed, as well as liberal historians who cherished Johnson's activism on Civil Rights and other liberal causes (and who conveniently wanted to forget Johnson's record in Vietnam and elsewhere). Many of Caro's sources have refused to be interviewed for his later books on Johnson, and historians such as Robert Dallek have written their own LBJ biographies in which they specifically single out and criticize Caro's view of Johnson. Yet far from disproving his arguments, the release of once-secret documents about Vietnam, as well as other biographies written over the last 20 years, have only confirmed many of Caro's assertions about Johnson. LBJ's bullying of even his closest aides, his vote-stealing in his 1948 Senate election, his illegal business schemes that allowed him to go from being literally \\"dirt poor\\" to a multimillionaire on a government worker's salary, his shameless brown-nosing of powerful politicians and businessmen, even while he had love affairs with their wives and girlfriends - all of the allegations made by Caro in 1982 have since been confirmed elsewhere. The fact that Lyndon Johnson was a lousy human being shouldn't be blamed on Caro - he simply dug up the facts (much of which Johnson had tried to hide from the public, such as cutting out all the unflattering photos of himself in hundreds of his college's yearbooks!)<br /><br />Yet despite the shocking and disturbing revelations in this book, Caro does seem to have a sneaking admiration for Johnson's unceasing drive and energy - the LBJ who emerges in this book may be unappealing in many ways, yet he also manages to move his beloved Hill Country into the twentieth century with cheap electrical power, good roads and schools, and other modern conveniences which its residents might never have gotten without his help. There are flashes in this book (albeit only briefly) of the more appealing LBJ that shows up in Caro's sequels to this biography - the college student who teaches English at a mostly Mexican-American school in Texas and genuinely tries to help his students succeed; the young man who begins to develop a real feeling and concern for America's poor and needy. If Caro's thesis is that even the most self-centered and crass politicians can still do some good, then in Lyndon Johnson he has found his perfect subject. And, it's worth noting that while Robert Dallek and others may have criticized Caro's \\"interpretation\\" of Lyndon Johnson, not one of his critics has dared to challenge Caro'sresearch or findings. Indeed, many of his critics have shamelessly used Caro's findings to try and support their own agendas. However, given that it was Caro who actually did the interviews and legwork, and given his unprecedented familiarity with Johnson's life, background, and career, it's difficult not to believe that Caro has a much better view of the \\"real\\" LBJ than any of his critics. If you're looking for a book that has passages that will stick in your memory for years, and which gives a view of a great American politician's early life which puts all others to shame, then the \\"Path to Power\\" will not be a disappointment. Superb!	2002-02-22

John Keel's \\"Mothman Prophecies\\" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled \\"John Keel explains how the universe really works\\". For every \\"Mothman\\" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the \\"Mothman\\" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's \\"research\\" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the \\"Mothman\\" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended.	2002-02-13

The modern UFO phenomenon started in America in the summer of 1947, when a prosperous businessman and private pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine strange &quot;disk-shaped&quot; craft flying over Mt. Rainier in Washington State. His story made headlines across the nation, and the &quot;UFO Era&quot; was born. Over the next five years (1947-1952) many of the most famous UFO sightings in American history took place, and the US Air Force became concerned enough to launch a top-secret investigation of the sightings. Originally called &quot;Project Sign&quot;, it concluded in 1948 that UFOs were interplanetary spacecraft from an advanced alien civilization. The Pentagon rejected this analysis, fired most of the staff, and renamed &quot;Project Sign&quot; as &quot;Project Grudge&quot;, with the new mission being to debunk all UFO reports. However, in the early fifties the wave of UFO reports reached an all-time high (it has never been equalled since), and even some high-ranking officers in the Pentagon became convinced that SOMETHING strange was taking place in America's skies. So they reorganized &quot;Project Grudge&quot; into &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;, and appointed a young but talented USAF Captain, Edward J. Ruppelt, to supervise the new, beefed-up UFO investigation.<br /><br />From 1951-1953 Ruppelt presided over a kind of &quot;golden age&quot; of UFO reports. Under his guidance Project Blue Book objectively and thoroughly investigated each UFO report it received. Ruppelt was naturally skeptical of UFOs, but he also didn't dismiss the subject as &quot;nonsense&quot;, and he insisted that his staff take the phenomenon seriously and remain open-minded when they were investigating UFO cases. As a result he wasn't afraid to label a case as &quot;unsolved&quot; or &quot;unexplainable&quot; when he or his staff couldn't find a &quot;normal&quot;, rational explanation for a sighting. Ruppelt managed to investigate some of the most famous UFO cases in history, including the &quot;Lubbock Lights&quot; in Texas, which were seen by science professors at Texas Tech University, and which were photographed by a Texas Tech student. He also investigated the two famous UFO &quot;movies&quot; shot in Utah and Montana on old home-movie cameras. The Montana film was shot in 1950 by the manager of the Great Falls minor-league baseball team, and it showed two bright objects moving rapidly across the sky above the local baseball stadium. The Utah film was shot in 1952 near the Great Salt Lake by a professional Navy photographer. The film shows 12-15 bright objects (which bear a remarkable resemblance to the Montana film) flying in formation in the clear blue sky. The US Navy analyzed both films and, as Ruppelt writes, they judged that both films showed &quot;genuine&quot; UFOs - not birds, not planes, nor any other &quot;normal&quot; phenomena.  Ruppelt also investigated the great &quot;Invasion of Washington&quot; in July 1952 when UFOs were seen above the nation's capital and were detected by radar at two airports in Washington. (The &quot;Invasion of Washington&quot; made front-page headlines across the country, and even President Truman called Ruppelt personally and wanted to know what was going on).<br /><br />Ruppelt left the Air Force in 1953 for a civilian engineering job, and in 1956 - much to the displeasure of the Air Force, which had forced Project Blue Book to return to debunking all UFO sightings - he wrote &quot;The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects&quot;. This book is still considered to be the &quot;classic&quot; account of UFO sightings in the late forties and early fifties, and it also provides a wealth of information about how the US government and military viewed the UFO &quot;problem&quot; during those years. Ruppelt is a good writer, and the book is well-written and filled with many interesting stories and anecdotes from pilots, scientists, military officials and others whom Ruppelt talked with about UFOs. Ruppelthimself was an &quot;open-minded skeptic&quot; and he doesn't include any explanations for what UFOs might be - he simply describes his investigations into the subject and his experiences as Project Blue Book's supervisor. I should add that in 1960 an &quot;enlarged and updated&quot; edition of this book was published with three additional chapters written by Ruppelt. In these new chapters Ruppelt is far more critical of the UFO phenomenon than he was in the original 1956 edition, and basically states that all UFO sightings are explainable in conventional terms. Needless to say, this &quot;revised&quot; 1960 edition caused considerable controversy when it was published, with some critics claiming that the Air Force pressured Ruppelt into adding the three new chapters. Others claim that Ruppelt's investigation of the weird New Age &quot;contactee&quot; UFO movement in California soured him on the entire UFO phenomenon; at any rate, I would recommend buying the original, &quot;unrevised&quot; 1956 edition for a better (and possibly more accurate) view of Ruppelt's experiences as the Air Force's chief UFO investigator. This book is an absolute &quot;must&quot; for any UFO buff or anyone who's interested in the early history of UFO sightings in America. Highly recommended!	2002-02-08
US	45555192	R87UI3M9QPOB8	0684193124	278897824	WOODROW WILSON	Books	4	23	24	N	N	A "Near-Great" Biography of a "Near-Great" President...	The top five Presidents in American history are called \\"great\\" Presidents by historians, and the next five Presidents are usually referred to as \\"near-great\\". Woodrow Wilson, our 28th President, is usually placed into the near-great category. \\"Near-great\\" Presidents are those leaders who accomplished many of their goals, but fell just short in one area. And \\"near-great\\" is also how I would rate this biography by August Heckscher. It is easily the best one-volume biography of Wilson to appear in many years. Heckscher writes eloquently of Wilson's troubled childhood. The first President from the South since the Civil War, Wilson grew up in the shadow of his domineering father, a well-known and intimidating Presbyterian minister in some of the South's largest and wealthiest churches. The elder Wilson expected nothing less than perfection, and his son often had a difficult time meeting those expectations. As a result he often turned to his doting mother for emotional warmth and support, and as Heckscher notes, he would always be extremely dependent upon the support and encouragement of women to boost his self-confidence.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, perhaps, Wilson still grew up to resemble his father, for good and ill. On the positive side Wilson was strong-willed, extremely intelligent, ambitious, idealistic, and an eloquent orator like his father. But on the negative side he could be narrow-minded and self-righteous, humorless (at least in public), inflexible, and prone to making enemies. His health was also poor, and it can be persuasively argued that he suffered two major strokes before assuming the Presidency - once in 1896 and another in 1908. However, neither Wilson nor anyone else recognized them as strokes, but instead he regarded them as \\"nervous breakdowns\\". The first and only President with a Ph.D (in political science) Wilson enjoyed a distinguished academic career, first as a professor at Princeton University and then (from 1902-1910) as the President ofPrinceton. Wilson transformed the sleepy, laid-back campus into the distinguished university that it still is today, but his domineering leadership style earned him many enemies, and Wilson eventually quit after losing a bitter battle to change the living and social conditions on campus by forcing the wealthier students to live and work with the less well-to-do. In 1910 the corrupt Democratic bosses of New Jersey were looking for a \\"respectable\\" candidate to run for Governor - someone who could legitimately run as an \\"honest\\" candidate while being weak or naive enough to remain under their control. In Wilson, a nationally known college president and intellectual, they thought they had their man, or rube. Wilson accepted their offer, won the election, and then dramatically turned against the bosses, leading a major effort to clean up New Jersey politics. His about-face won national acclaim and helped make him the Democratic presidential candidate in 1912. In one of the nation's most colorful and historic presidential races, he defeated his two opponents - President Taft, the Republican candidate, and Teddy Roosevelt, the third-party Progressive candidate - and became President.<br /><br />During his two terms as President, Wilson passed major domestic legislation such as giving women the right to vote, ending child labor, and improving safety conditions in factories and mines. He also endured the crushing death of his first wife from kidney disease, quickly remarried a year later, and tried desperately to keep the nation out of World War One. In 1916 he barely won re-election in a race that was so close the winner wasn't announced for several days. In early 1917, after German submarines began sinking unarmed American merchant vessels, Wilson convinced Congress to declare war on Germany and the nation entered World War One. At the end of the war in 1919 came Wilson's greatest failure. Determined to bring about \\"world peace\\", Wilson helped create the League of Nationsto peacefully settle disputes between countries. He knew, however, that without US membership and leadership the League would be useless. Unfortunately, Wilson's domineering leadership style as President had alienated the Republicans and even some members of his own party in Congress. Led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, they were determined to defeat Wilson and prevent US entry into the League. To gain public support for his cause, President Wilson went on a nationwide speaking tour by train. But in early 1919 he suffered a massive stroke that nearly killed him. He was not able to return to work for months (his second wife and staff kept the news from the public, and his wife was in many ways the \\"acting President\\" during this period). Wilson never regained the full use of his body or speech, and Lodge and his allies were able to easily defeat the League. An invalid, Wilson died in 1924 after predicting that the US would pay a huge price for its' failure to join the League, which was proven true when the League proved to be powerless to stop Hitler's rise to power in the 1930's.<br /><br />Heckscher eloquently lays out these details (and many others) about Wilson's life and career. However, the book fails to turn up any original or new insights into Wilson's life and character that previous biographies have not already discussed. Additionally, Heckscher largely ignores another dark side of Wilson's life - his strong racist beliefs regarding blacks. Wilson's low opinion of African-Americans has been an ugly blot on his Presidency that many historians chose to ignore until the 1990s, and Heckscher would have been well-advised to at least mention in some detail this flaw in his character. Among other things, Wilson as President went out of his way to enforce segregation in previously-integrated federal departments and agencies, and many black workers were fired or given lower-paying manual-labor jobs. Despite this flaw, however, this is still an excellent and detailed account of a high-minded, well-meaning, but ultimately flawed and tragic President. Recommended!	2002-01-06
US	45555192	RQO2JV6UZ8FX3	096069546X	343934759	Presidential Temperament: The Unfolding of Character in the Forty Presidents of the United States/With Supplement	Books	3	16	18	N	Y	Fascinating, but filled with historical errors...	As someone who loves US history, politics, and psychology, I've always been fascinated by books which try to \\"psychoanalyze\\" Presidents and historical figures. Two books which have done this are Dr. James David Barber's \\"Presidential Character\\" and William Strauss and Neil Howe's \\"Generations\\", which looks at US history throught the prism of four generational types, which repeat themselves in cycles (they argue that the Baby Boomers are the descendants of the Puritans!). And this book, \\"Presidential Temperament\\", uses a system which should be familiar to many readers. The book's authors use the well-known Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to \\"type\\" each of our Presidents. Many businesses and schools use the Myers-Briggs test, but for those who are not familiar with the system, it tests people on four different sets of preferences (Extrovert-Introvert, Sensing-Intuition, Thinking-Feeling, and Judging-Perceiving). Thus, there is an \\"ISTJ\\" type (quiet, reserved, methodical, thorough, practical, etc.); an \\"ESFP\\" type (outgoing, \\"touchy-feely\\", compassionate, idealistic, spontaneous, etc.), and so on. The test is not supposed to be used to judge or rate other people, as every type is useful and necessary to make our society function.<br /><br />In \\"Presidential Temperament\\" the Myers-Briggs test is applied to all of our Presidents since Washington. The authors use biography and history books to examine the childhoods, personalities, leadership styles, successes and failures of the Presidents to place them into one of three Myers-Briggs types: Artisans, Guardians, and Rationals (a fourth type, the Idealists, have never had a US President, according to the authors. Instead, leaders such as Gandhi and Eleanor Roosevelt fall into this category). The Artisans are the \\"SP\\" types - fun-loving, optimistic, tough-minded, and above all, action-oriented. They love the \\"action\\" part of politics - they live in the \\"here-and-now\\" and are great at dealing with crises. Among the Presidents inthis category are both Roosevelts, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. The \\"Guardian\\" types are the \\"SJ\\"s - they are tradition-oriented, generally honest and reliable, addicted to duty and \\"law-and-order\\". They are the good managers and administrators who keep things running smoothly, but they dislike change. According to the authors, George Washington, Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman, and the first George Bush all fall into this category. The final category are the \\"Rationals\\" - they are \\"NT\\"s on the Myers-Briggs scale. They are the visionaries and strategists - they can marshall great forces to accomplish great things, but can be undermined by their distaste for showing emotion and \\"people skills\\" in public. They are extremely intelligent, but can come across as arrogant or aloof. Thomas Jefferson, both Adamses, Abraham Lincoln, and Dwight Eisenhower are all Rationals, according to the book. After \\"typing\\" each President, the authors then show how their temperament type affected their Presidency - Jefferson the Rationalist designing the University of Virginia and envisioning a continent-size United States, hence the Lousiana Purchase; Franklin Roosevelt the Artisan \\"Performer\\" dealing with the twin crises of the Great Depression and World War Two, etc.<br /><br />This is all truly fascinating, even if you don't always agree with the author's claims. However, the book is severely hampered by the numerous factual errors that I found. For example, in the chapter on Bill Clinton they listed his birthday as August 19, 1947 (it is actually August 19, 1946), and then later  in the same chapter gave his birthdate as August 14, 1946. John Quincy Adams' birthday is given as July 11, 1967 (he was born in 1767), and Eisenhower's birthday is listed as October 14, 1880 (he was born in 1890). Woodrow Wilson is listed as having lived in Atlanta during the Civil War, but he actually lived in Augusta, not Atlanta. The chapter on William Henry Harrison even has an incorrect photograph - it has a large photo of James Buchanan labeled as Harrison! While these errors may seem insignificant by themselves, taken together (and there are numerous other inaccuracies, from presidential birthdays to biographical information) they cast some real doubt on the author's credibility and research. In short, while \\"Presidential Temperament\\" is a fascinating \\"psychological\\" look at our Chief Executives, the many historical errors left me wondering just how much \\"research\\" and editing the authors put into their arguments - and that overall makes the book something of a disappointment.	2002-01-04

In some ways this may account for FDR's strange obscurity in today's politics and historical memory, for like Lincoln and Washington, FDR's achievements are so great that he doesn't seem as \\"human\\" as leaders such as Truman, nor as dramatic and tragic as a Kennedy.<br /><br />In this thoroughly engrossing biography, Ted Morgan brings us not the larger-than-life FDR of myth, but a fully human, \\"warts-and-all\\" look at our longest-serving Chief Executive. Morgan vividly brings to life the privileged world that FDR grew up in, and offers marvelous anecdotes and portraits of FDR and the people in his life that brings the man and his era alive in a way that no other FDR biography even approaches. While other historians may offer a more fact-filled and event-oriented approach, many of their books (such as Frank Freidel's biography) are often dry and fail to grasp why FDR was so popular with the public or why he became such a dominant political figure. Morgan includes most of the great events of Roosevelt's life - his fight against polio, the years as Governor of New York, the New Deal, his leadership in World War Two - but he also mentions little details and stories that illustrate the impact he had on ordinary people's lives during the Depression, and shows how even his personal flaws (such as his endless capacity for telling people exactly what they wanted to hear, even if he had no intention of meeting their requests) were actually political strengths. Morgan doesn't shy away from the dark sides of FDR's life and career that many of his other biographers refuse to mention. Among these are his long love affair with Lucy Mercer, which nearly ended his marriage to his distant cousin Eleanor; his involvement in a sordid sex scandal involving using US Navy sailors to catch a homosexual Episcopalian priest, which FDR approved as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and then lied about his involvement when the scheme was discovered and came under criticism; his habit of lying, even to his closest friends and advisers; and his general lack of parenting skills with his children.<br /><br />However, Morgan also includes the more positive aspects of FDR's personality - the sympathy for the underdog; the genuine concern to help the less-fortunate in our society; the ability to innovate, try out new ideas and programs, and the ability to radiate confidence and optimism to a nation that sorely needed both traits in the dark days of the Depression and World War, all these and more are described by Morgan. If you want a straightforward, chronological account of FDR's Presidency, then there are other books which will offer you the basics of FDR's political career. But if you want to understand FDR as a person and human being, as well as a great political leader, then this book is by far your best choice. For its' ability to offer a portrait of a President that literally gives you the feeling that you \\"knew\\" the man personally, Ted Morgan's \\"FDR\\" is without peer...an excellent read for any US history or political buff!ey wanted to hear, even if he had no intention of meeting their requests) were actually political strengths.

US	45555192	R1PB3N5WPAPMSX	0673393283	791697083	A Righteous Cause: The Life of William Jennings Bryan (Library of American Biography)	Books	4	16	19	N	N	An excellent introduction to the "Great Commoner"...	William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925) has the dubious distinction of being one of only two men in American history to run for President three times and lose each time. Yet Bryan almost certainly qualifies as one of the most influential \\"losers\\" in American history, for despite his defeats he retained a large and loyal following that allowed him to remake the Democratic Party in the early twentieth century. The son of a country judge in Salem, Illinois, Bryan was raised in a solidly middle-class family by devoutly religious parents. Bryan attended law school in Chicago and then moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and opened his own law office. From the beginning his good looks, marvelous voice, and gifts as an orator made him a celebrity in Nebraska. Bryan used these skills to side with the \\"underdogs\\" of the Midwestern prairies - the farmers who were being driven into bankruptcy and foreclosure by a worsening economy and a lack of support from the federal government in Washington. In 1890 he was elected to Congress - a rare victory for the Democrats in a Republican state. He soon earned a reputation as a superb speaker with a magnetic voice - and as a controversial foe of the big businesses that controlled both political parties.<br /><br />In the 1890's a nationwide economic depression gave Bryan the chance to seize control of the Democratic Party from the conservative, pro-gold standard faction led by President Grover Cleveland. At the 1896 Democratic National Convention he gave what is still regarded as one of the greatest political speeches in American history - a ringing defense of farmers and an assault on the \\"robber barons\\" of New York's Wall Street. The \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech electrified the delegates and earned Bryan, at the age of 36, the presidential nomination. Over the next four months Bryan traveled by train to all parts of the nation, spoke to huge crowds, and basically ran the first modern \\"liberal\\" presidential campaign. He pushed for unemployment insurance, social security, government credit for farmers and small businessmen, an end to child labor in factories and coal mines, women's suffrage, and better working conditions for factory workers. Although we take many of these things for granted today, the Republicans and Big Business regarded them as dangerous and a threat to the national economy. They raised record sums of money to defeat Bryan, threatened factory workers with layoffs if they voted for Bryan, and in the end defeated the \\"Great Commoner\\" (so-called because of his affinity for the \\"common people\\" of America) by a narrow margin. Yet Bryan's heroic campaign allowed him to make the Democrats into the \\"liberal\\" party that they are today. In 1900 and 1908 he was again nominated for President by the Democrats - in 1900 he spoke out against American \\"imperialism\\" overseas and even uttered warnings that America could not be the world's policeman - a warning that we still argue about today. In 1912 Bryan played THE key role in securing the Democratic nomination for Woodrow Wilson - thus making Wilson President. Bryan served as Wilson's Secretary of State from 1913-1915, during that time he worked tirelessly to keep the USA out of World War One. When Wilson threatened to go to war with Germany in 1915 following the sinking of the British passenger ship Lusitania - a sinking which cost 128 American lives, Bryan resigned as Secretary rather than support a move towards war - a war which Bryan honestly felt would \\"waste\\" thousands of American lives.<br /><br />Over the last decade of his life Bryan became a leading spokesman for religious fundamentalism, and an outspoken opponent of the theory of evolution. In 1925 he made his last dramatic stand as the prosecutor in one of the most famous trials of the twentieth century. John T. Scopes, a biology teacher in the high school of Dayton, Tennessee, was arrested and put on trial for teaching the theory of evolution in violation of a state law forbidding it. The defense hired Clarence Darrow, the nation's most famous trial lawyer (the Johnnie Cochran of his day) and a militant critic of traditional Christian beliefs, to defend Scopes. When Bryan agreed to \\"battle for the Lord\\" and lead the prosection, the trial became a national sensation. The trial's climax came when Darrow put Bryan on the witness stand as an \\"expert\\" on the Bible and proceeded to ridicule his beliefs, such as that Jonah was swallowed by a great fish, or that Adam and Eve were really the first two humans on the Earth. Although Scopes was found guilty (he never paid the $100 fine), Bryan was so humiliated by Darrow's questioning and so exhausted by the trial that he suddenly died a few days later. Many big-city reporters and editors continued to ridicule Bryan even after his death - they regarded him as an ignorant rural hick with no redeeming qualities. Yet large numbers of people still turned out for his funeral - ordinary, \\"common\\" folk who realized how hard Bryan had fought on their behalf, and how much he had sacrificed in their cause. As this book points out, nearly all of the things Bryan fought for have since been enacted into laws, and most of the Democratic Party's great leaders of the past century - from Wilson to FDR to Huey Long to Harry Truman to Adlai Stevenson and Lyndon Johnson - owe Bryan a debt of gratitude for transforming the Democrats into a liberal party. As Truman noted \\"If it wasn't for Old Bill Bryan, there wouldn't be any liberalism at all in the country now\\". This biography, while short, is nonetheless an excellent introduction into one of the most influential - and controversial - politicians in American history.	2001-11-21
US	45555192	R2F61WDD7CKYK4	0385313489	140919625	The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932	Books	5	27	29	N	N	A larger-than-life book about a larger-than-life man...	William Manchester (1922 - 2004), one of the World War Two generation's finest writers, wrote about everything from the Kennedys to acid-penned reporter H.L. Mencken. But in this book he presents his greatest work - a superb biography about one of the twentieth century's greatest heroes - Sir Winston Churchill. This volume, which includes the first fifty years of Churchill's crowded life, is written with a Victorian style and passion for adventure that Churchill himself would have admired. (What other biography uses the word \\"Array\\", instead of \\"Table of Contents\\", to list the chapter headings)? Churchill's life does read like something out of a Hollywood script - he was the scion of one of England's most prominent families. His father was a member of Parliament and could have become Prime Minister, had he not developed syphillis, which eventually drove him mad and killed him at an early age. He was often cruel to his son Winston, harshly criticizing even his smallest mistakes. His beautiful American-born mother had extramarital affairs with many handsome men, including the King of England.<br /><br />Largely ignored by his wealthy and famous parents, Churchill was raised mostly by servants (including his beloved nanny); in his youth he was often a \\"problem child\\" and was expelled from several private schools. He finally found a career in the British Army, and fought in a number of small but bloody wars in Britain's colonies in Africa and India. He often was in the thick of the fighting, recklessly exposing himself to bullets and cannon fire. In the Boer War in South Africa in the late 1890's Churchill was captured by enemy troops and placed in a prisoner-of-war camp, but made a daring escape and returned safely to his own forces. Elected to Parliament at the age of 25, he quickly moved up the political ladder, even changing political parties when it suited him. By World War One he was the head of the British Navy, but here things began to go wrong. In 1915 he proposed to invade and conquer Turkey, a German ally, thus knocking it out of the war and allowing Allied forces to attack Austria and Germany from the south. The plan was sound, but the invasion was so bungled by incompetent British generals and admirals that it was a total failure, and Churchill was forced to take the blame and resign in disgrace. He then spent some time as an infantry officer in the front lines in France, and in the 1920's enjoyed something of a political comeback as the Chancellor of the Exchequer (a position similar to our Secretary of the Treasury). However, his poor handling of Britain's economic woes led him to fall out of favor, and by the end of the book in 1932 Churchill is an outsider in Parliament, with little real power or influence.<br /><br />Yet this book is far more than a simple biography. True to form, Manchester offers an engrossing account of the entire Victorian era that Churchill grew up in - the glories of the British Empire, the racist \\"raj\\" system in British-ruled India (where white Englishmen were encouraged by hotel signs \\"not to beat their (Indian) servants\\" in the hotel lobby); the terrible conditions that Britain's poor lived under; and the peculiar social mores and customs of the British upper class to which Churchill so proudly belonged. Although Manchester clearly admires Churchill (and who wouldn't, after reading this book), he isn't afraid to note that in many ways Churchill was a very flawed man, and must have been difficult to deal with. An open snob, Churchill had all of the prejudices of his class - he treated his servants poorly, insulted his secretaries and others who couldn't keep up with him mentally or verbally, disliked strong women and wasn't above making chauvinistic remarks about them in public, and he had a huge ego and seemed to think that the rest of the world revolved around him and his needs. And, while he expressed sympathy for the lower classes, he regarded Britain's middle class with aristocraticdisdain, despite the fact that they paid most of the nation's bills and taxes. Yet his genius, as Manchester copiously notes, was genuine - his brilliant skills as a writer and orator, his political and personal courage, his genuine commitment to personal freedom and liberty, all these and more made him one of the great historical leaders of all time.<br /><br />Quite simply, not only is this Mr. Manchester's finest work (out of many), but it reads more like great literature than a simple biography - \\"The Last Lion\\" is a larger-than-life book about a larger-than-life man. Manchester followed this biography with a sequel, entitled \\"Alone\\", which followed Churchill from the low point of his career in the 1930s up through his selection as Prime Minister in 1940, with Britain facing an invasion from Nazi Germany. Sadly, a severe stroke in the late 1990's kept Manchester from finishing his epic trilogy on Churchill's life (another writer was hired to finish the third book, but in my opinion it doesn't measure up to Manchester's two volumes). However, this is one of the best biographies in print, and should be read by any Churchill fan. Highly recommended!	2001-11-11
US	45555192	R2WSSUJEYX14N3	0688066615	24767251	Adlai Stevenson: His Life and Legacy	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A Moving Tribute to a Liberal Icon	Adlai Stevenson (1900-1965), has long been regarded as one of the most beloved liberal politicians of modern times. To the liberal wing of the Democratic Party in the 1950's and 1960's, Stevenson was a heroic figure, an eloquent and brilliant statesman who had the courage to criticize demagogues such as Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon when few other Democrats were willing to do so. In his two failed presidential campaigns against the popular Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, in 1952 and 1956 Stevenson became known internationally for his moving oratory and quick wit (Example - when Eisenhower criticized Stevenson in 1952 for not being serious enough, Stevenson, noting Eisenhower's refusal to take on right-wing zealots like Joe McCarthy, jabbed back: \\"The General is worried about my funnybone, but I'm worried about his backbone\\").<br /><br />In this moving and eloquent biography - written in a style that Stevenson himself probably would have admired, Porter McKeever, a close friend of Stevenson and a strong admirer - has penned an excellent look at his hero's life and times. Stevenson came from a distinguished political family in Illinois - his grandfather and namesake was the U.S. Vice-President under Grover Cleveland - and so he came naturally to politics as a career. Curiously, although he is known as a great intellectual, he did poorly in school and college (he went to Princeton) and even flunked out of law school, mainly because he found the law boring (however, he later did get a law degree and opened his own law firm). In the 1930's and 1940's he worked at various government jobs, winning the respect of his superiors and even catching the eye of President Franklin Roosevelt himself. In 1948 he wanted to run for the US Senate in Illinois, but instead the infamous Democratic \\"machine\\" in Chicago, led then by Jacob Arvey, convinced him to run for Governor. He won the election easily and immediately became the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952. In part this was due to his friendships with many famous journalists and newspaper columnists, who relentlessly pushed his name forward as a candidate. Yet Stevenson himself was remarkably ambivalent about running for President, and when President Truman tried to convince him to run in early 1952 he refused, thereby making a lifelong enemy of him. Unlike most major politicians, Stevenson wasn't afraid to be modest and admit to his inner \\"doubts\\" that he had the skills to be President - which only served to further endear him to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Over his objections, his name was put forward by various prominent Democrats and he was nominated. Although he lost to Eisenhower in the fall of 1952 (and, again, in 1956) he did inspire many younger liberals to enter and participate in politics - many of these people would later serve in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.<br /><br />Despite his sophistication and highly idealistic views of what America could become, Stevenson did have his problems - his childhood was traumatized by his parent's constant bickering and fighting, and by the fact that as a young boy he accidentally shot and killed a girl while playing with what he thought was an unloaded rifle. His marriage, to Ellen Borden, was extremely rocky - she later developed mental problems and became resentful and angry at her husband's success and popularity - and they were divorced in the late 1940's. Stevenson did have a number of affairs with other women - this biography includes a number of romantic and eloquent love letters to his lady friends - yet he never remarried. Stevenson's last years were rather sad - in 1960 several of his friends tried, against his express wishes, to get the Democrats to nominate him for President for a third time - but he was trounced by the Kennedy brothers, who ever after resented what they felt was his \\"indecisiveness\\" and \\"weakness\\". Although Stevenson desperately wanted to be Secretary of State, JFK deliberately bypassed him and instead offered him a lesser job as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. The Kennedy brothers routinely left Stevenson \\"out of the loop\\" in their decision-making, and even sometimes enjoyed making his life miserable \\"just to see how much old Adlai will take\\". As it turned out, he would take quite a lot, and he served as our UN Ambassador until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1965.<br /><br />Although this biography is a tribute to a man the author greatly admired, it is surprisingly objective and McKeever is not afraid to point out his hero's weaknesses. To this day many liberals still look to Stevenson as a model of statesmanship and idealistic politics - and that makes this well-written biography well worth reading.	2001-11-03
US	45555192	R216CZ5L2YVX9T	0345410610	37245129	Robert Kennedy and His Times	Books	4	6	7	N	N	The Best of the Kennedy "Court Histories"...	Since President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, the Kennedy family has become a part of American mythology - our first \\"royal\\" family. To date more books have been written about the Kennedys than all of our other great political families (the Roosevelts, Adamses, Rockefellers, etc.) combined.<br /><br />Basically, books written about the Kennedys fall into one of 3 groups: the early, so-called \\"court\\" histories, which were written mostly by devoted aides and supporters of the Kennedys and which are highly, and in some cases almost embarrassingly, favorable towards the family. Then comes the \\"revisionist\\" histories, which look at the family from a very critical point of view. And, finally and most recently, have come the more balanced and objective histories, such as Richard Reeves' \\"President Kennedy: Profile of Power\\", released in 1993, and Robert Dallek's \\"An Unfinished Life: A Biography of John F. Kennedy\\", published in 2003.<br /><br />This biography, \\"Robert F. Kennedy and His Times\\", published in 1978, was written by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a prominent liberal historian and political activist, and it clearly falls into the \\"court\\" history category. Schlesinger worked as an aide and speechwriter for President Kennedy, and following JFK's death he became a close friend and confidant to Robert Kennedy until his assassination in June 1968. In the 1950's Schlesinger worked as a speechwriter for Adlai Stevenson, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate who was beloved by Northern liberals like Schlesinger but, ironically, was held in contempt by both Kennedy brothers as a wimp and \\"egghead\\" idealist. In the 1960 campaign Schlesinger transferred his allegiance to the Kennedys, and he spent the rest of his career as an historian as the family's main supporter and defender in print. This often led to considerable criticism from other historians, and Schlesinger's first major Kennedy book, \\"A Thousand Days\\", his history/memoir of JFK's Presidency, was widely regarded as so favorable in its view of JFK that its credibility has been the frequent target of attack.<br /><br />However, in \\"Robert Kennedy and His Times\\", Schlesinger - while admiring the Kennedys as always - is considerably more objective and impartial than he was in his earlier Kennedy books, and as a result this remains the best single-volume  biography of Robert Kennedy. Schlesinger is an excellent writer, and the book is engrossing reading from beginning to end, despite its considerable length. Schlesinger openly states that he didn't especially admire or even like Robert Kennedy when he first met him in the 1950's, but through close contact he eventually warmed to him and they were close friends by the time Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. Even Schlesinger notes that RFK did have a \\"dark side\\" - he could be rude and domineering with other people, he often had a moralistic, black-and-white view of events and people, he ruthlessly protected his brother and other family members from threats (real or perceived), he often took chances that were reckless, and he had far more enemies than his older brother did. Although Schlesinger (as expected) stoutly defends RFK from many of the criticisms that have been aimed at him - his coverups of his brother's womanizing, the rumored relationship with Marilyn Monroe, the wiretapping of Martin Luther King (according to Schlesinger, it was all FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's fault, even though he admits that RFK approved the wiretaps) - he still offers a sweeping and persuasive view of the 1960's and of how RFK tried to deal with the many crises of that violent and chaotic decade.<br /><br />Among the many issues of the 1960's Robert Kennedy was forced to deal with were the Cuban Missile Crisis and the challenge of Castro's Cuba in Latin America, the civil rights movement in the South, and, after his brother's death, the war in Vietnam and antiwar protests and riots, race riots, and a growing divide between America's races, regions, old and young, and economic and social classes. Schlesinger also offers a riveting account of Robert Kennedy's famous feud with President Lyndon B. Johnson - a rivalry that would tear the Democratic Party apart (in no surprise, Schlesinger takes the Kennedy's side against LBJ in this biography). In my opinion, Schlesinger's least-persuasive argument comes at the end of the book, when he claims that Robert Kennedy would almost certainly have won the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination and the presidential election (over Republican Richard Nixon) if he had lived. Many other historians strongly disagree, and there is considerable evidence that, even if Kennedy had lived, he would have lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey. In the end, however, this is an eloquent and moving tribute to a man that Schlesinger clearly admired and wanted to be President - and, despite its pro-Kennedy bias, it remains, in my opinion, the best book written about the Kennedy family by one of their strongest admirers.	2001-10-09
US	45555192	R1MBNFIY2OUZL1	0895264102	680964179	Coolidge: An American Enigma	Books	5	69	70	N	N	An excellent study of "Silent Cal" and the "Roaring 20s"...	Calvin Coolidge, who served as President from 1923-1929, has long been rated as a \\"poor\\" President by liberal historians and academics who fault him for his seemingly passive, quiet, and inactive approach to the Presidency. In this first-rate biography, Mr. Sobel shows us just how wrong those judgments are. Far from being a \\"Silent\\" or \\"Lazy\\" President, Coolidge ran a remarkably honest and efficient administration that led America through one of the most exciting and prosperous decades in American history - the \\"Roaring Twenties\\".<br /><br />As Sobel demonstrates, Coolidge was born and raised in an environment  - rural and isolated - which the great majority of Americans today would find alien. He grew up in the tiny rural village of Plymouth, Vermont. His beloved mother died when he was young and he was raised by his father, a classic \\"pillar of the community\\" type - his father was serious, sober, religious, a prosperous farmer and general-store owner, and a local politician who served as a justice of the peace, constable, and Vermont state legislator. Coolidge grew up to be an equally serious-minded and self-reliant young man - a modern Puritan, without the hypocrisy or self-righteous attitude. Like Truman, much of Coolidge's life seemed utterly ordinary, and he was an unlikely President. A competent lawyer in Northampton, Massachusetts, Calvin married Grace Goodhue and had a happy marriage, fathered two sons (to whom he was devoted), and slowly but steadily climbed the political ladder. Unlike many modern politicians who want to start off with a major office (such as Senator or Governor) and then immediately try to run for President, Coolidge spent many years in local and state politics before he became a \\"big-time\\" politician - a fact which probably accounted for his success as President. He served as a city councilman, Mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts state legislator, Speaker of the Massachusetts State Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and finally Vice-President and President. During his long climb Coolidge was never dramatic or spectacular, but he was intelligent, efficient, honest, reliable, and a good speaker. People seemed to like and trust him wherever he went, and his dry yet biting wit, and his quiet and reserved personality became legendary (in one famous story, Coolidge went to a party and said nothing. The hostess, desperate, approached him and said \\"Mr. President, I made a bet with my friend over there that I could get at least 3 words out of you tonight\\". Coolidge's reply: \\"You lose\\").<br /><br />What this biography does is to give the reader a much better appreciation for the man, and Sobel convincingly demonstrates that the great economic boom of the 1920's was not merely a fluke, but the direct result of Coolidge's shrewd business sense and leadership. Anyone who continues to rate Coolidge as a poor President should be required to read this book and refute Sobel's persuasive arguments. To sum up, this is a first-rate book about a much-neglected President, and it should be read by all political and presidential history buffs.	2001-09-30
US	45555192	R25BLWRA2ATUME	0671869205	680068737	Truman	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An Excellent, if too favorable, presidential biography...	If I were able, I would actually have given \\"Truman\\" four and one-half stars instead of five. It's hard to argue with this book's enormous popularity - when it was released in the early 1990's it received generally rave reviews and became the best-selling presidential biography of the decade. And in most respects \\"Truman\\" deserves the praise it has recieved. David McCullough is a marvelous writer, as anyone who has read his earlier works (such as \\"Mornings on Horseback\\", his splendid account of the early years of Teddy Roosevelt) can testify. McCullough's research of Truman's remarkable life is thorough, and his writing style makes it seem as if you are with Truman on every step of his long journey towards the White House. Truman was the unlikeliest of Presidents - and he may be the last \\"non-millionaire\\", non-college-educated person ever to serve in the Oval Office. Compared to many of our great Presidents (a rank which Truman is now accorded, thanks in no small part to this book), most of Truman's life was totally ordinary. He was a farmer who scratched for a living, he adored his wife and was completely faithful to her, he had to put up with a demanding and snooty mother-in-law who thought he was never good enough for her daughter, and he was a failed businessman who constantly worried about paying the bills. Truman's life really took off when he served as a soldier in World War One, and he learned that he could effectively command large groups of men and earn their respect. He subsequently entered Kansas City politics, serving as an honest and efficient county judge (county commissioner) in an otherwise crooked and despised political machine run by Tom Pendergast, the nationally infamous \\"boss\\" of Kansas City. Despite the fact that Pendergast was eventually sent to jail, Truman remained fiercely loyal to him, even though it hurt him politically. Truman displayed this trait time and again, and while his personal loyalty was admirable, it also got him into troublewhen his friends turned out not to be as honest and open as he was. I won't recount Truman's life here, as other reviewers have done so, but I do have one problem with the book, and that is McCullough's favoritism towards Truman. Although some other reviewers have claimed that the book is \\"even-handed\\", I would argue differently. Truman did have his flaws, but McCullough either glances at them and quickly moves on, or he just ignores the criticisms that others have made. One example is Truman's racial feelings. McCullough does briefly mention that in his youth Truman often spoke disparingly of Jews and Blacks, but argues that he \\"made up for it\\" by pushing civil rights for blacks and helping create the nation of Israel as President. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's \\"conversion\\" to these ideals came in an election year (1948) in which he was the underdog and needed all the minority votes he could get. In the 1950's and early 1960's Truman also made some negative remarks about Martin Luther King and the civil rights marchers in the South, a fact which McCullough never mentions. Also, like many pro-Truman biographers, McCullough makes Truman into the underdog hero of the 1948 presidential election, when Truman shocked the pollsters and experts to defeat the heavily favored Republican candidate, Thomas E Dewey. What McCullough doesn't mention is that Truman's campaign was every bit as negative and divisive as those of later Republican candidates (such as Richard Nixon) who have been much criticized for their \\"dirty\\" campaigns. Truman, as has been proven by numerous memos and campaign letters, deliberately made personal attacks on Dewey and made wild, unsubstantiated charges (in one speech he came close to comparing Dewey and the Republicans with Hitler and the Nazis, a speech which McCullough doesn't mention). Truman's campaign deliberately played upon the fears and prejudices of working-class Democratic farmers and workers (just as Republicans such asNixon played upon the fears of Republican voters). In my opinion, had Truman been a Republican candidate, he almost certainly would today be strongly criticized by historians for his 1948 campaign, but instead he is given the heroic role by McCullough (Truman's opponent, Dewey, ran a campaign that was a model of what most voters say they want - he refused to reply to Truman's \\"mudslinging\\", almost never mentioned Truman by name, and gave upbeat, optimistic speeches in which he refrained from personal attacks). In spite of these weaknesses, however, \\"Truman\\" is overall an excellent study of how a \\"common man\\" who was no different from your average \\"next-door neighbor\\" became one of the most important Presidents of the twentieth century. As \\"Truman\\" proves, there is a latent greatness in the average, taxpaying middle-class American citizen - a fact which should provide encouragement if this nation ever again faces the crises and problems which Truman himself had to face.	2001-09-06

Thomas Whalen's &quot;Kennedy versus Lodge&quot; attempts to correct this bias by offering the reader a well-written, well-researched account of a truly historic US Senate race in Massachusetts between two of the most important political families in American history. Until 1952 the dominant political family in Massachusetts and New England was the Republican Lodge family, and they were far better-known and more distinguished than the Kennedys. The Lodges were descended from the original English, Puritan colonists who had settled Massachusetts in the 1600's, and they had made their millions in the nineteenth century while the Kennedys and other Irish Catholic immigrants to Boston were fighting just to survive. From the 1880's to the 1920's the family's most famous figure was Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr. A close friend of Theodore Roosevelt and one of the most powerful men in Congress, Lodge led the fight to keep the USA out of the League of Nations and became President Woodrow Wilson's most hated enemy. Lodge also looked down his nose at the &quot;grubby&quot; Irish Catholic immigrants who were beginning to outnumber the older Protestant English families (called &quot;Yankees&quot; or &quot;Brahmins&quot;) who had dominated Massachusetts politics since the United States became an independent nation. In 1916 Lodge faced a stiff challenge for his Senate seat by John &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, the popular Irish Catholic Mayor of Boston, and who was John F. Kennedy's grandfather. Lodge narrowly defeated Fitzgerald, thus beginning a great rivalry between the two families. Fitzgerald's daughter, Rose, desperately wanted to avenge her father's defeat by the Lodges, and in 1952 she got her chance when her handsome and charming son, Congressman John F. Kennedy, ran against Lodge's grandson and namesake, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., for a Senate seat. Lodge was the dominant politician in New England and a national leader of Liberal Republicans (and there used to be lots of Liberal Republicans). Kennedy was originally seen as the underdog in the race, and Lodge had beaten some tough Irish Catholic politicians before. Lodge even advised JFK's tough father, Joe, to &quot;save his money&quot; and avoid the race. Of course, that only made the Kennedys even more determined to &quot;get even&quot; and defeat the Lodges once and for all. They poured a huge amount of money into the race, ran a slick advertising campaign, and John F. Kennedy himself repeatedly visited every town and village in Massachusetts. Lodge, however, was so confident of victory that he ignored his own race and spent most of 1952 helping to lead the fight to get the Republican presidential nomination for Dwight Eisenhower and defeat the conservative Republican candidate, Senator Robert Taft of Ohio. Eisenhower won the nomination, but Taft's angry supporters in Massachusetts vowed revenge against Lodge and defected to Kennedy's campaign. Lodge didn't get his own Senate campaign started until August 1952, and by then the Kennedy's campaign &quot;machine&quot; was running at full steam. In the end John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Lodge and &quot;evened the score&quot; for the Kennedys. As Whalen points out, this Senate campaign truly made history. If Kennedy hadn't beaten Lodge, he almost certainly would never have become President. And if Lodge had won, then he would have become one of the most powerful Republicans in America, and could have been the Republican presidential nominee in 1960 instead of Richard Nixon. And, of course, Kennedy's victory allowed his family to replace the Lodges as New England's most powerful and famous political dynasty. After their 1952 defeat, the Lodges never again elected a member of their family to political office, and today the family has &quot;retired&quot; from political life. Overall,this is a fine book about an important Senate race between two wealthy and prominent politicians whose careers would change American history, for better and for worse.	2001-09-03
US	45555192	R2OL2QTYOAWMSA	0785773363	682788101	Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry s Truman	Books	3	54	60	N	N	Highly Entertaining, and Highly Inaccurate	When I first read \\"Plain Speaking\\" over 25 years ago, I immediately thought that it was one of the best and most entertaining political books I'd ever read. And if I had to rate \\"Plain Speaking\\" on the sheer delight you get from reading it, then I'd easily give it six stars instead of five. Unfortunately, research by several noted historians in 1995 at the Truman Library has revealed that at least some of Truman's statements in \\"Plain Speaking\\" were never spoken by Mr. Truman, but were entirely the products of Merle Miller's imagination. As a result, while \\"Plain Speaking\\" is still a wonderful read if you've got a few free hours, it is no longer taken as serious history by biographers and historians. \\"Plain Speaking\\" isn't a traditional, full-length biography of Truman, instead it is a brief \\"oral biography\\" of the man, presumably spoken in Truman's own words.<br /><br />Merle Miller, a veteran journalist, visited the ex-President in 1962 and taped a series of interviews with him. His hope was that he could sell these interviews to a TV network. But when no network bought the rights, in 1974 Miller simply printed the interview transcripts and turned them into this bestselling book. Miller clearly admired Truman, and as a result his questions are often partisan and/or favorable - Miller's questions are of the softball variety. For example, in one question Miller asks Truman \\"Are they {the Republicans} just stupid?\\", and Truman gives a typically partisan response. Even so, many of Truman's replies to Miller's questions are delightfully blunt and laugh-out-loud funny: \\"I didn't fire General MacArthur because he was a dumb son-of-a-*****, although he was, but that's not against the law for generals...\\", etc. Over the course of the book Truman bluntly critiques Eisenhower, Henry Wallace, Douglas MacArthur, and even John F. Kennedy (whom Truman dryly calls \\"the boy\\" and matter-of-factly claims had his 1960 nomination and election victory \\"bought\\" for him by his sinister father, Joseph Kennedy. It's safe to say that Truman was no admirer of the Kennedys, particularly JFK's father - when the Kennedys accused him of opposing JFK's nomination because he was a Roman Catholic, Truman quipped \\"I'm not against the Pope, I'm against the Pop!\\"). After reading this book, it's hard not to admire Truman and find him to be a refreshing change from the modern politician who calculates every word and lies constantly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it turns out that at least some of Truman's statements were fake - they were nothing more than figments of Merle Miller's imagination. In 1995 Dr. Robert Ferrell, an historian, was writing a biography of Truman. At the Truman Library he examined Miller's transcripts and tapes of his interviews with Truman, and discovered (much to his surprise) that many of Truman's statements in \\"Plain Speaking\\" were nowhere to be found in the transcripts or tapes. Dr. Ferrell did discover that in 1963, when Miller wanted to write a magazine article about his interviews with Truman, the former President wrote a letter to Miller in which he bluntly criticized Miller's \\"misstatements\\" in quoting him, and threatened a lawsuit if Miller had the article published (he didn't). In fact, Miller waited until nearly two years after Truman's death in 1972 to publish \\"Plain Speaking\\" - thus ensuring that Truman wasn't around to file a lawsuit or point out Miller's \\"misstatements.\\" The simple fact that Miller ignored Truman's complaints and went ahead with this book's publication - and then presented himself as one of Truman's greatest admirers - leads me to give \\"Plain Speaking\\" no more than three stars. I suspect that Truman himself would be appalled at how Miller successfully portrayed this book as an accurate portrait of what he said in the interviews. \\"Plain Speaking\\" is a great read, but as accurate history it is sadly lacking, and the reader should always keep this in mind.	2001-09-02

Along with Herbert Parmet's \\"Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy\\", Richard Reeves' \\"President Kennedy\\" is one of the two best biographies that I have read about a legendary (and much-romanticized) American President. Unlike Thomas Reeves' hatchet-job \\"A Question of Character\\", which basically could be called a job in \\"character assassination\\"; or books such as Arthur Schlesinger's \\"A Thousand Days\\", which idolize Kennedy and ignore his flaws and failures as President, Richard Reeve's book maintains an admirably objective and balanced view of our 35th President. Reeve's Kennedy is neither a liberal saint nor a debauched devil, but is instead a complicated and often frustrating man who is woefully unprepared for the Oval Office when he moves in in January 1961, but does possess a great many gifts that save him when he gets into trouble. Reeve's Kennedy makes many mistakes early on in his Administration - the Bay of Pigs, his disastrous summit with the Soviet Union's Nikita Krushchev in Vienna, and his reckless womanizing in private, which as Reeves notes might well have become public knowledge if some enterprising reporter had ever followed JFK's movements very closely. Yet Kennedy does learn from at least some of his mistakes, and his handling of the Berlin Wall Crisis and the Cuban Missile Crisis was excellent. Whether Kennedy would ever have grown into a great President is a matter of debate among historians, and after reading this book I had my answer - JFK was a good President in many ways, but he probably would never have become a great one, due to his overly cautious nature on civil rights and the other great issues of the sixties. In short, this is a very well-written, impressively researched, and very fair-minded look at one of our most difficult Presidents to study and write about...this should be required reading for anyone who's interested in the 1960's, the Kennedys, or American politics.	2001-08-26

As a Southerner whose ancestors fought for both the Confederacy AND the Union in the Civil War, I tend to disagree with both sides in the debate over &#34;Lee Considered&#34;. I do agree with those who argue that a more balanced and realistic view of Robert E Lee is long overdue, and that Nolan's book does offer some telling blows at the Lee mythology. But, I also don't believe that Nolan has made the &#34;convincing&#34; case against Lee that some of the posters on this board would have you to believe. Nolan, who is a lawyer and not an historian (a fact that should always be kept in mind as you read this book), attempts to put the romantic, mythological Lee &#34;on trial&#34; and expose him for the flawed and decidedly unheroic person that Nolan believes him to be.  Like a good lawyer, Nolan denies trying to &#34;convict&#34; Lee in the beginning of the book, and even states that he admires him in some ways, but the rest of the book reveals Nolan to be committed to convicting his target of several specific charges. Namely: 1) That Lee was privately far more supportive of slavery than the Lee myth would have it; 2) That Lee was far more supportive of secession and &#34;breaking up the Union&#34; than his myth reveals; 3) That Lee made numerous mistakes as a General that helped cause the South's defeat - mistakes such as pursuing an aggressive, &#34;go get'em&#34; strategy that led to the highest casualty rates of any Civil War General and bled his smaller army dry; and 4) That Lee prolonged the Civil War longer than was necessary by continuing to fight after Gettysburg, which Nolan argues convinced Lee that the South was doomed to defeat, and therefore he should have urged the Confederacy to surrender, or at least refused to fight or encourage his men to make useless sacrifices for a cause he privately knew was doomed.  Nolan presents a good deal of evidence (much of it in Lee's own words), but like a good prosecutor he leaves out evidence which contradicts his theories, and he completely ignores the fact that Lee was a nineteenth-century man, not a late twentieth-century one. An historian would have put many of Lee's views into further context (without necessarily excusing them). Dr. James McPherson, the famed Civil War historian and author of &#34;Battle Cry of Freedom&#34;, can hardly be called a &#34;neo-Confederate&#34; historian (if anything he's pro-Union), but even he has some problems with Nolan's book. A few years ago he wrote a criticism of &#34;Lee Considered&#34; in which he &#34;judged&#34; Nolan's &#34;trial&#34; of Lee, and while he found Lee to be &#34;guilty&#34; of being more pro-slavery than the Lee myth allows, he also found Lee to be &#34;innocent&#34; of prolonging the War (McPherson points out that the South still had a good chance of winning the war right up to Lincoln's reelection in November 1864), and that Nolan failed to &#34;prove&#34; many of his other charges, although McPherson argues that Nolan does raise some worthwhile questions about the accuracy of the traditional Lee myth. I fully agree with McPherson's views - this book is worth reading because it does offer a view of Lee that is in some ways more &#34;realistic&#34; than the Lee myth. However, Nolan fails to destroy Lee's reputation as a great general and one of the true &#34;legends&#34; of American military history. Overall, this book is quite a mixed bag, but it's still a thought-provoking, intellectually stimulating piece of work, even if Nolan is sometimes off-target.	2001-08-25

Although I wouldn't necessarily agree with a previous reviewer that Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky was the most important failed politician in US History (he probably was for the nineteenth century, but I would rate William Jennings Bryan as the most important \\"failed\\" presidential candidate of the twentieth), there's no denying that Robert Remini has written the definitive biography of a man who has been consistently rated as one of the three greatest congressional leaders in history. There is some irony here, as Remini is well-known as the definitive biographer of Andrew Jackson, Clay's greatest rival and enemy (in his prologue Remini notes amusingly that an elderly lady who worked for the Jackson Historical Society told him that Mr. Jackson \\"might shoot you\\" for writing a biography of Clay). Yet despite his admiration for President Jackson (which I do not share), Remini is admiringly objective and fair-minded in this biography. Clay was a poor Virginia boy who traveled to Kentucky at a young age and made a fortune as a lawyer, planter and slaveowner. At the age of 34 he was elected to Congress and was immediately chosen as the Speaker of the House, and he remains the only Congressman to achieve the Speakership so quickly. Clay soon became one of the nation's leading politicians, and he would eventually become a kind of \\"living legend\\", and would maintain that status until his death in 1852. Handsome, charming, witty, and brave (like Jackson, he fought several pistol duels in defense of his \\"honor\\", a prized asset in the antebellum South), Clay was also calculating, conniving and extremely ambitious, which proved to be his undoing. He ran for President three times and lost each time (much to Jackson's delight), yet this never lowered the affection and esteem in which he was held by his many admirers and fellow politicians. Clay's primary role throughout his career was in working out compromises between the Northern and Southern states over problems such as slavery, tarriffs, and states' rights - all issues which threatened to tear the nation apart. Indeed, had Clay not risen from his deathbed in 1850 and helped to secure the \\"Compromise of 1850\\", the Civil War might have happened a decade earlier. Clay's presence in Congress - and his skills in keeping the North and South together as one nation - probably prevented the Civil War for thirty or more years, and it is no accident that following his death in 1852 the two sections became increasingly divided and bitter towards one another, with a Civil War soon to follow. Abraham Lincoln called Clay his \\"beau ideal of a statesman\\" and used Clay's passion for keeping the Union together as an inspiration for fighting the Civil War. I must confess that I was a great admirer of Clay long before I read this biography, and it only confirmed my belief that Clay was far better qualified to be President than almost anyone who actually held the office at the time (including Jackson). Unlike Jackson, Clay was willing to protect the Cherokee Indians and other tribes of the Southeast instead of forcing them on a death march to Oklahoma (the infamous \\"trail of tears\\"); and unlike Jackson, Clay developed a plan, called the \\"American System\\", to develop America's resources and businesses by building new roads and canals and funding men who wanted to set up corporations (Jackson consistently vetoed such ideas). And unlike his two great rivals in Congress, Clay had neither the narrow-minded rigidity and fondness for slavery of John C. Calhoun (even though he was a slaveowner himself, Clay opposed its spread to the Western territories and he seriously considered notions of its eventual abolition); or the dark moods, cynicism, and overall grimness of Daniel Webster. If you want to read an engrossing biography of one of America's greatest statesmen - a man who showed what the \\"Art of American Politics\\" is all about, then Robert Remini's \\"Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union\\" will not be a disappointment. Highly Recommended!	2001-08-14
US	45555192	RAINGCH5XYN6I	0446357383	329601471	The Kennedys: An American Drama	Books	4	23	25	N	N	A &quot;Warts-And-All&quot; Look at America's &quot;Royal Family&quot;	I disagree with what BOTH of the reviewers below have written about this book. In my opinion, &quot;The Kennedys&quot; doesn't fairly or unfairly &quot;bash&quot; the Kennedys - it just tells the story of this remarkable New England family as it really was - without the hype, romanticism, or nitpicking that their critics and admirers have done to them over the years. Relying upon extensive interviews (some of which had never been done until Collier and Horowitz did them) this book starts out by telling of the rise to fame and fortune of the &quot;Founding Father&quot;, Joseph P. Kennedy (1888-1969). It was &quot;old Joe&quot; who ruthlessly yet cleverly built the family's vast fortune, and did so by bootlegging whiskey during Prohibition, making early Hollywood films (and having a not-so-secret extramarital affair with the actress Gloria Swanson, which his wife ignored), and other legal and not-so-legal methods. Horowitz and Collier were among the first biographers of the Kennedy family to point out Joe's almost-complete domination of his male children, and his relentless pressure on them to excel, to &quot;win&quot; at everything they did, even if it was just a &quot;friendly&quot; sailboat race. The Kennedys were never supposed to lose at anything, and Joe made his large family into a kind of tribal, &quot;us-against-them&quot; clan with its' own rules and traditions. The middle section of the book follows the Kennedy boys as they attempt to fulfill their father's expections. Some encounter tragedy, such as the family's &quot;golden boy&quot; Joe, Jr. who was killed in a suicidal mission over England in World War Two. JFK and Bobby then enter politics and the familiar &quot;Camelot&quot; story is exposed as the sometimes-successful, sometimes-not affair that it really was. The final section of the book generated the most controversy, yet this third section may be among the most poignant and devastating pages ever written on the Kennedys or the American obsession with &quot;success&quot;. This section focuses on the latest generation of Kennedys - the children and grandchildren of Joe, JFK, Bobby, and Teddy. Over their parent's strong objections, Horowitz and Collier did interviews with many of these &quot;survivors&quot; of the terrible tragedies which had befallen their fathers and uncles. What they found was that the third generation of the Kennedy dynasty had been left leaderless (and parentless) by the older generation's deaths. Some had been in trouble with the law, some were addicted to drugs (such as David, who overdosed on cocaine in a hotel room in 1984, not long before this book was published). Collier and Horowitz paint a devastating portrait of young men and women who go through the motions of being &quot;good Kennedys&quot; but who have grown tired of living in a glass house and are both bemused and cynical of the family &quot;business&quot; (politics) that they are expected to take part in. Several of these people are running for political office next year (2002), or will be in the next few years, and although many years have passed since the book was released, the stories in this final section should give any voter concerns about electing anymore Kennedys into public office. Collier and Horowitz are especially effective in showing how the actions of one generation haunted the younger generation which followed them. As one of the younger Kennedys the authors interviewed in 1983 told them: &quot;I keep asking myself what was it in my grandfather that made him push the family so hard and cause us all such tragedy&quot;? Far from being a &quot;hatchet job&quot; on the Kennedys or a sappy, admiring biography such as Doris Kearns Goodwins &quot;The Kennedys: An American Saga&quot;, this book by Collier and Horowitz tells the story of our greatest political dynasty as it really was, with no blinders, rose-colored glasses, or fairy tales. An excellent, thought-provoking book.	2001-08-12
US	45555192	R19ZQXH0WTF58N	0375700773	203371491	The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman Won the 1948 Election	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Very Good, but still flawed campaign history...	Dr. Zachary Karabell's &quot;The Last Campaign&quot; focuses on the legendary 1948 presidential campaign - one of those rare campaigns which are remembered and discussed decades after they took place (as, I suspect, the 2000 campaign will be discussed by historians fifty years from now). The primary reason this campaign has achieved &quot;legendary&quot; status is because of the fact that President Truman won the election when practically every poll and every &quot;political expert&quot; showed that he was a certain loser. The shock and surprise of his victory - and the Republican defeat - would have major consequences on the 1950's and beyond. The 1948 campaign is indeed a great story, and the dramatic events of that year seem like something out of a suspenseful novel. Unfortunately for Dr. Karabell, there have already been two excellent books written solely about the 1948 campaign, and while they are both more than thirty years old, they are both better than &quot;The Last Campaign&quot;. Jules Abel's &quot;Out of the Jaws of Victory&quot;, and Irwin Ross' &quot;The Loneliest Campaign&quot; provide an even better and more in-depth story of the 1948 election than does Karabell. Karabell's book is well-written and at times even witty. Unlike most historians, Karabell does accurately point out that Truman's famous upset was not simply the victory of a &quot;plain-talking&quot;, folksy Truman over a &quot;packaged&quot; and artificial Republican opponent. Truman's famous &quot;Give'em Hell&quot; campaign was just as calculated and &quot;packaged&quot; as was his Republican opponent. Karabell is also right on the mark when he points out that Truman's upset was brought about when Truman ran a very negative and divisive campaign filled with nasty references to Dewey and all Republicans as &quot;gluttons of privilege&quot; and the like. Many historians, such as David McCullough in &quot;Truman&quot; refuse to point out that Truman's harsh rhetoric and language are what led to his victory, and also so infuriated the Republicans that they declared war on Truman in 1949, and unleashed their own demagogues, such as Joe McCarthy, to smear Truman and the Democrats as Communists or Communist sympathizers. Dewey, meanwhile, ran a campaign that was a model of what most Americans say they want in a candidate - he was upbeat, refused to attack the Democrats or even mention Truman's name, and emphasized the need to bring Americans &quot;together&quot; after the election. But if Karabell is right about the reality of Truman's harsh campaign, his other analysis is much less successful. Karabell's thesis is basically that television - which came to the fore after 1948 - has &quot;ruined&quot; our presidential campaigns by turning them into bland, boring contests in which images and style are more important than issues and substance. This complaint has been voiced in virtually every political era (it might amuse some people to know that in 1948 there were growing complaints among critics about the &quot;issueless&quot; politics of the time), and Karabell never really proves that the &quot;issues&quot; in 1948 were adequately discussed. A big part of Karabell's argument is that the two third parties in 1948 - Strom Thurmond's right-wing, racist States Rights' (or &quot;Dixiecrat&quot;) Party, and Henry Wallace's left-wing &quot;Progressive&quot; Party made 1948 the &quot;last&quot; year in which the voters of America were offered a &quot;genuine&quot; choice of candidates. However, this book was published during the 2000 campaign, which as in 1948 featured two centrist candidates (Gore and Bush), a genuine left-winger (Ralph Nader's Green Party), and a genuine racist right-winger (Pat Buchanan's Reform Party). It's hard to be nostalgic for the past when you've got a strikingly similiar campaign happening in the present! The difference between 1948 and 2000 is that whereas the two third parties in 1948 couldn't keep Truman from winning the election -they simply cut into his victory margin - in 2000 the two third parties DID prevent Gore from beating Bush (by taking votes away from Gore in Florida and elsewhere). In short, Karabell's &quot;The Last Campaign&quot; is a well-written, but somewhat superficial and analytically flawed, look at the most famous upset in presidential politics. But I'd still say that the two older books on the 1948 campaign I mentioned above are better.	2001-08-12

Heymann has done an impressive amount of interviews and research, and while some readers may argue with his interpretation of certain events, there's no doubt that he's done his homework. This book follows Jackie from her surprisingly unhappy childhood, which was marked by an ugly divorce between her dashing yet womanizing and big-spending father and her uptight, social-climbing and rather cold mother. Jackie was a definite daddy's girl - she adored her father and never seemed to care too much for her mother or the second man she married, wealthy stockbroker Hugh Auchincloss. Thereafter comes the familiar story - she grows into a beautiful and sophisticated young woman (who emphasizes her father's French ancestry and ignores her mother's Irish heritage), attends the best women's private schools in the US and France, becomes engaged to a nice yet boring young stockbroker; but then breaks off the engagement when she begins dating a sexy and exciting US Senator who just happens to come from a wealthy family - John F. Kennedy. Then comes the high-society wedding, the rocky marriage (made so by Jack's constant cheating and Jackie's aloofness from her in-laws), her glamorous tour as First Lady, the assassination, and finally her controversial marriage to the crude yet wealthy Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Although Heymann tries to be objective and fair to his subject, the book does seem to emphasize the flaws and dark sides of Jack and Jackie. Some readers who have a romantic view of Jackie may not want to read this book, as it will definitely destroy your romantic view of her. Yet while she had her flaws, there's no denying her now-legendary poise during her husband's funeral or her outstanding role in raising her two children to be good citizens and good people. Overall, this is an engrossing warts-and-all biography of one of the most famous women of the twentieth century.	2001-08-11
US	45555192	R9VWGH49UNZH4	068480140X	47532935	The Roosevelts: An American Saga	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Fine Generational History of an American Political Dynasty	As a U.S. History teacher I often get this question when my classes reach the early twentieth century: &quot;How are Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt related - were they brothers, or father-and-son&quot;? When I point out that they were distant cousins, the students are amazed, and I suspect that many Americans with only a minimum knowledge of history would be, too. As this excellent book by Peter Collier and David Horowitz points out, there were two distinct branches of the Roosevelt family. One branch became Republicans and settled into the wealthy neighborhoods of Manhattan and Oyster Bay, on Long Island; while the other branch became Democrats and lived on a huge, English-style estate along the Hudson River in upstate New York. Although the two branches of this Dutch-descended family got along fairly well in the nineteenth century, in the early twentieth century a venomous feud erupted between the children of Theodore Roosevelt and their distant yet ambitious cousin, Franklin, and his revenge-minded wife, Eleanor. The first part of this book focuses on the rise of Theodore Roosevelt to fame and power in politics. In many ways &quot;TR&quot; represented the best of the American past - he was young (at 42 the youngest ever to become President), dynamic, and progressive. His large brood of children were no less energetic and flamboyant (in particular his eldest child Alice, who shocked polite society by smoking in public and making &quot;unladylike&quot; comments - Theodore himself said that he could &quot;be President or control Alice, I cannot possibly do both&quot;). As their beloved father grew older and his political star began to wane after 1909, his children assumed that the mantle of family and national leadership would be passed on to his oldest sons, especially Theodore, Jr. But they soon discovered a &quot;nemesis&quot; - Franklin D. Roosevelt of the Democratic Hudson River Roosevelts, became an assistant to President Woodrow Wilson and beganmanuevering to oust Theodore's children from the throne. He was assisted by his wife Eleanor, who was the daughter of Theodore's tragic brother Elliot. Unable to keep up with his wildly successful older brother, Elliot simply gave up and fell into a life of drinking, gambling, and womanizing and died at an early age. Young Eleanor always blamed the Oyster Bay Republican Roosevelts for &quot;destroying&quot; her adored father, and she vowed revenge. In the 1920's she derailed Theodore, Jr's attempts to become Governor of New York by smearing him with a political scandal, thus ending his political career and earning Eleanor the embittered ridicule of Alice, who thereafter often enjoyed making fun of Eleanor's buck teeth and nasal accent for her dinner guests. (She also took numerous verbal swipes at her cousin - after hearing that Franklin was having an extramarital affair, Alice snorted &quot;He deserves to - he's married to Eleanor&quot;). The second half of the book describes the rise to power and Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the career of his wife Eleanor, and the many problems and failures of their children - largely brought on, Collier and Horowitz argue, by the neglect of their famous parents. This family feud doesn't really end until decades after Franklin D. Roosevelt dies in 1945, and both branches of the family have left politics for the quieter pursuits of business. My only disappointment with this book is that it skims over many of the great accomplishments of both Roosevelt Presidents - this book is NOT a comprehensive history of their Presidencies! However, it is an extremely well-written and engrossing account of the rise and fall of two branches of one of America's greatest families.	2001-08-09

Like other controversial American politicians such as Bill Clinton and Franklin D. Roosevelt, there was little middle ground concerning how the public felt about Richard M. Nixon. To some Americans, Nixon was the most sleazy and two-faced man in American politics, and they despised him. As Adlai Stevenson, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate, said in the 1950s, Nixon was the kind of man who &#34;would cut down a redwood tree, then climb on the stump and make a speech for tree conservation.&#34; But to other Americans, Nixon was a gutsy fighter from a poor family who had, through sheer hard work and intelligence, climbed up the ladder of success, only to be reviled by wealthy &#34;limousine liberals&#34; whose success had come because of their family, prep school, and Ivy League social connections, not because they succeeded on their own, as Nixon had done. Not surprisingly, perhaps, books written about Nixon also tend to fall into one of these two categories - the &#34;hatchet jobs&#34; written by historians who obviously dislike Nixon and print every negative thing they can find about him; and the mostly admiring books written by his former aides and supporters, who defend his actions and attack his enemies as &#34;hypocrites&#34; who did the same things as Nixon, but just never got caught (partly because they were protected by a liberal news media).   The late Stephen Ambrose, one of America's most prominent historians and a former Nixon critic, nonetheless provides what is probably still the most balanced and fair-minded account of Nixon's dramatic life and career with this book. Published in 1987, &#34;Nixon: The Education of a Politician&#34; follows Nixon from his bleak and rather sad childhood to his two bitter defeats for political office - first to John Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race (an election so close that Nixon believed until the day he died that Kennedy had &#34;stolen&#34; the election from him in Chicago and Texas), and his devastating loss to Democrat Pat Brown in the 1962 California governor's race - a defeat which led many experts to write off Nixon as a political &#34;dead duck&#34; and has-been. Unlike many of Nixon's previous biographers, Ambrose manages to keep his feelings about Nixon to himself and instead he concentrates on telling a well-written, well-researched account of the first fifty years of Nixon's life. As Ambrose writes, Nixon had good reason to be somewhat bitter and resentful - his father was one of life's &#34;losers&#34; who seemed to fail at almost everything he did, despite years of backbreaking work. The Nixons were a hard-luck family - oil was discovered on land the Nixons owned but sold just before drilling began, thus preventing a chance to become wealthy; two of Nixon's brothers died from tuberculosis while young, causing his mother to put enormous pressure on Richard to be successful in life and make up for the family's loss. In Ambrose's descriptive retelling, the young Richard Nixon was a classic nerd - brainy, but also terribly awkward socially, with few friends and regarded as a &#34;know it all&#34; by his classmates. From a young age he was also a complete workaholic, an all work-and-no-play type. By the time Nixon entered college he was a very bright and energetic, but also cold and aloof, young man who had a hard time making friends and having fun - he was always so &#34;serious&#34; and grim-looking, his mother remembered. At Duke University Law School he graduated third in his class, but made almost no friends and was called &#34;Gloomy Gus&#34; by his classmates for his overly serious and stuffy manner.   Nixon would repeat this pattern into his political career - working longer and harder than everyone else, maintaining an intense, serious, and rather cold personality, but also lashing out at his political opponents, even when he didn't have to, thus making many powerful enemies in the press and Democratic Party. But Ambrose also notes that Nixon was a highly productive and skilled politician whose reputation among liberals for simply being a &#34;hatchet man&#34; was often undeserved. Ambrose argues that Nixon provided key support for postwar initiatives such as the Marshall Plan, and Eisenhower often used Nixon and his genuine diplomatic skills to keep the GOP's right wing in line behind administration policies. Ambrose also points out that Nixon, and his wife Pat, time after time, faced social snubs and slights from his wealthier peers - first the glamorous Helen Gahagan Douglas in his 1950 US Senate race, then Adlai Stevenson, then Nelson Rockefeller, then the Kennedys, and even Eisenhower himself. Nixon became increasingly obsessed with moving up the political ladder, as much for vindication over his enemies as due to simple ambition, even as his personal enjoyment of politics steadily declined. By the end of this engrossing biography Nixon's political career appears to be over, yet he is already planning his comeback. &#34;Nixon: The Education of a Politician&#34; is only the first volume of a three-part biography, as Ambrose went on to write two more volumes to conclude his study of Nixon's career. However, in my opinion neither of the two succeeding volumes can match this one for writing style, interest, and drama. If you want to read an engrossing account of one of this century's major political leaders, then &#34;Nixon: The Education of a Politician&#34; is still your best choice nearly thirty years after it was first published.	2001-08-04

Vermont Royster (1914-1996), was in his day one of the most respected and influential journalists in America. As the editor-in-chief of \\"The Wall Street Journal\\" from 1957 to 1970, he won 2 pulitzer prizes and transformed the Journal into one of America's major newspapers. Yet this memoir is far more than just the story of Royster's tenure as the Journal's editor. It is also an eloquent and nostalgic account of his boyhood and adolescence in Raleigh, North Carolina. Royster writes wonderfully of what it was like to grow up in what was then one of North Carolina's most distinguished families. One of his more entertaining tales is of how he obtained his unusual name. It seems that Royster's great-grandfather decided to name all of his children after states, so they would \\"stick out\\" in the Raleigh area. The names were outlandish: Louisiana Carolina Royster was a daughter's name, and some of the son's names were Arkansas Delaware, Wisconsin Illinois, and Iowa Michigan. (These names were so unusual that they were included in the \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\" books). Mercifully they were called by their first and middle initials. Vermont's grandfather, for whom he was named, was Vermont Connecticut Royster.<br /><br />The Roysters were an unusually well-educated and prosperous family for the time (pre-Civil War), and one even taught Latin and Greek at the University of North Carolina. But the Civil War devastated the family - the family fortune was ruined, several of the older brothers were killed or crippled in the war, and Vermont's grandfather and namesake lost his chance at a college education because of it. To rebuild the family fortune, Vermont and his crippled brother Arkansas founded the Royster Candy Company, which was a profitable success and sold candy all over Virginia and the Carolinas. Vermont's father inherited the family business, and Vermont's accounts of his childhood visits to the family's chocolate factory in Raleigh are delightful. Royster went on tobecome a somewhat rebellious and stubborn youth (and he leaves the impression that he must have been a stubborn and combative adult), but he did discover a talent for writing at the University of North Carolina, where he ran the student newspaper. Like many ambitious Southerners prior to the 1960's, he left the South after graduating from UNC and moved to New York City, where he soon obtained a job as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, then a small (35,000 circulation) financial newspaper still struggling to recover from the 1929 Stock Market Crash and Great Depression. Royster spends a good deal of the book describing his slow but steady rise from the Journal's White House correspondent (where he covered Franklin Roosevelt) to editor-in-chief. This part of the book is filled with plenty of behind-the-scenes office politicking and power plays, and Royster often seems more of an amused onlooker than a participant.<br /><br />Another outstanding chapter in the book is Royster's account of his naval experiences in World War Two as the captain of a destroyer, the USS \\"Jack Miller\\", in the Pacific. His ship saw a considerable amount of combat against the Japanese (and survived being caught in the teeth of a major hurricane). Royster vividly describes his trip at the end of the war to Nagasaki, where the USA dropped the second atomic bomb on Japan, and where Royster and a small group of officers were the first Americans to see the city's devastation. And, history and political buffs will be delighted by Royster's vivid anecdotes describing the Presidents, major politicians, and other celebrities he encountered in his life. After retiring as the Journal's editor in 1970 he taught journalism at the University of North Carolina and wrote a weekly column for the Journal until the mid-1980's. There have been many memoirs and autobiographies penned by members of the World War Two generation, but in my opinion this is one of the most eloquent, nostalgic, and thoughtful. Ifyou're looking for a book that will provide a weekend's worth of fine reading about a time and era that continues to haunt the present, then Vermont Royster's \\"My Own, My Country's Time\\" will more than meet your expectations.	2001-07-26
US	45555192	R2SJFSMOVJ2BGP	0895870711	953520246	State Parks of North Carolina	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Great Little Guide to a Beautiful State	North Carolina (of which I am a native, so please forgive the bias) likes to advertise itself as the \\"Variety Vacationland\\" and after reading the \\"State Parks of North Carolina\\" it's not hard to see why. Eastern North Carolina features hundreds of miles of beaches, lighthouses, coastal villages, swamps, Civil War forts, and the two largest landlocked sounds in the United States. The central section of the state (the Piedmont) features rolling, forested hills occasionally broken by isolated, jagged peaks (usually called \\"knobs\\" locally) with excellent rock climbing and superb views, and swift rivers and large, manmade lakes. And in western North Carolina there are the Appalachian mountains, featuring the highest peaks east of the Mississippi river. This outstanding book, written by two biology professors from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, covers all 41 of North Carolina's state parks. These two men traveled to each of the state parks and thoroughly explored them (they traveled over 9,000 miles in researching this book). Although naturally concerned with the plant and animal life in the parks, the book is still designed with the camper, hiker, or even casual visitor in mind. The authors divide the parks into three geographic sections - coastal plain, Piedmont, and mountains, and they also include seperate sections on the state's nature preserves and recreation areas (all located on the shores of its' largest manmade lakes). The chapters on each park feature a map with roads, hiking trails, campgrounds, etc., contact information for the park, the park's main attractions, a section on the history of the park, a section on the plant and animal life to be found in the park, a section on hiking and (if relevant) climbing trails, a section on campgrounds or other facilities (and park activities, if any), and a section on nearby historic and/or natural attractions. There aren't many photographs, but I suppose that's to encourage the reader to see the parksfor themselves. If you're interested in visiting North Carolina, or you're a native Tar Heel who's looking to explore your state, then this book is a great place to start! I've used it on a number of trips, and it has proven its' value time and again.	2001-07-26

Contrary to what a previous reviewer wrote, Jerome Clark's \\"UFO Book\\" is neither biased nor too \\"thin\\" to be a superb reference source for someone who wants to learn more about the UFO phenomenon. While Clark is a \\"believer\\" in the sense that he believes that not every UFO sighting can be be dismissed as swamp gas, stars, weather balloons, or (failing all else) hoaxes, he is fair to the skeptics and debunkers and does include the explanations they have given for each of the sightings he discusses. And, given the negative publicity that this topic constantly recieves, it is refreshing to read a thoroughly-researched, well-written account of UFOs that at least tries (and usually succeeds) to be fair and balanced. Unlike many UFO books which are written by \\"true believers\\" who do little research and who see every UFO sighting as \\"proof\\" that we are being visited by aliens, or books by so-called UFO \\"skeptics\\" who actually twist or ignore the evidence in order to debunk every UFO sighting and dismiss the topic as \\"nonsense\\", Clark openly states in the prologue that both sides need to adopt a little-used three word phrase when dealing with the UFO phenomenon: \\"We don't know\\". This book is actually an abridged version of his much longer and more in-depth \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\". The \\"Encyclopedia\\", which has 273 entries, comes in two volumes, and costs about $(...), is designed for the more serious researcher or ufologist. The \\"UFO Book\\" contains some 90 entries from the \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\", yet it still covers, alphabetically, almost every major UFO sighting in America since the UFO phenomenon started in the summer of 1947. It also looks at the major theories used to explain UFO sightings and has brief biographies of most of the leading ufologists AND skeptics in the field. If you're a reader with a casual interest in UFOs, or you simply want to purchase a UFO book for your personal library that will give you a good overview of the subject, then the \\"UFO Book\\" is simply the best work that's been published...and it will probably remain so for a very long time.	2001-07-20
US	45555192	RWB235YDXDPC1	0451407474	359716484	Goddess: The Secret Life of Marilyn Monroe	Books	5	60	64	N	Y	Perhaps the Best Marilyn Biography Ever...	Anthony Summers is a respected British investigative reporter, and he's not afraid to delve into controversial subjects. Among other things, he's written one of the best-researched - and most controversial - books on the JFK assassination (\\"Conspiracy\\"). In \\"Goddess\\" Summers offers us a thoroughly-researched, extremely well-written account of one of Hollywood's greatest - and most tragic - actresses. The first two-thirds of the book takes us through Marilyn's turbulent life and film career. She never knew her father, and her mother suffered from schizophrenia and eventually was sent to a mental hospital - and as a result Marilyn (real name: Norma Jean Baker) constantly feared that she would also suffer a mental breakdown someday. Her life was a series of foster parents, short-lived love affairs that usually ended badly, sexual promiscuity, three (and possibly four, as Summers discovers) marriages, and always the hope on Marilyn's part that she could find the \\"right man,\\" get married, and settle down to raise a happy family.<br /><br />Of course, that never happened, and Summers writes sympathetically of her unhappy life - and of her brilliant acting career, in which she often drew upon her personal unhappiness for her best performances. The final one-third of the book generated considerable controversy when it was published in the 1980s, and it's not hard to see why. Summers argues that Monroe didn't commit suicide but was murdered - a murder that was covered up and made to look like a suicide. He also argues that she was \\"clearly\\" involved with the Kennedy brothers in her last days, and that her murder may have been tied to her relationship with them. He even implies that Bobby Kennedy may have been present in her home at the time of her death - a charge which seems fantastic, but Summers has interviewed enough people to prove that there were some strange things going on the night that she died. However, even if you don't believe Summers' murder theories, the firstpart of the book does offer one of the best, and most sympathetic, biographies of Marilyn's brief but brilliant life ever written. If you could only read one biography of Marilyn, then \\"Goddess\\" should be it.	2001-07-16

Sir Martin Gilbert, a British historian who rose to fame and fortune as the official biographer of Winston Churchill, outdoes himself with &quot;The First World War: A Complete History&quot;. Although some posters on this board have complained that Gilbert hasn't really written a &quot;complete&quot; history of that great conflict, I believe that Gilbert's meaning needs to be put into perspective. It IS true that Gilbert has not written an in-depth, &quot;complete&quot; MILITARY history of the war. Those who are seeking an in-depth analysis of the battles, strategies and tactics used by First World War commanders should look to other works, such as those of John Keegan, for fuller insights. However, Gilbert does offer a &quot;complete&quot; view of the war in ALL of its terrible aspects, not only the military scene, but also how the war changed the politics, national boundaries, culture and society, technology, and economies of the nations involved in the struggle. For a general reader or history buff who hasn't read much about the First World War, then Gilbert's book is simply the best that's been done. As Gilbert points out, the First World War had a greater impact on Europe and the world than the Second World War in many ways. So many of our current methods and machines of warfare - submarines, fighter planes, tanks, flamethrowers, poison gas and the rapid-fire machine gun - were all invented during the war. The First World War also witnessed warfare against innocent civilians on a then-unimagined scale. The Germans sank passenger ships (such as the Lusitania) with submarines - killing innocent men, women and children with little or no warning. Both sides carried out aerial bombardment of cities and towns, with little or no regard to the safety of the civilians below. Where this book especially shines is in Gilbert's ability to show the tremendous suffering of the soldiers in the trenches, men who often lived like (and with) rats in miserable manmade caves whileunder constant enemy bombardment and machine-gun (and poison gas) fire. Gilbert really brings home the senseless slaughter (there is no other way to describe it) of an entire generation of young European men. And, of course, the war changed Europe forever. Three great royal families were overthrown - the Romanovs in Russia, which led to the Communist takeover and the rise of the Soviet Union, with all that foretold for future world events (such as the Cold War between the Soviets and the USA); the arrogant Hohenzollern family in Germany, which led to chaos in the German government that didn't truly end until a hate-filled Austrian who had fought as a corporal in the German Army - Adolf Hitler -  became dictator in 1932; and the Hapsburg family in Austria, who had been players in European politics since the Middle Ages, but whose empire broke up after the war, creating the Eastern European nations we have today. Franklin D. Roosevelt gained invaluable military and government experience during the First World War as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to President Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill nearly saw his political career destroyed when he was forced to take the blame for the disastrous invasion of Turkey (a German ally) in 1915. The invasion was his idea, but its failure wasn't  - but Churchill was nevertheless forced to resign as the head of the British Navy, and not until after the war ended did he begin his long political comeback.If this book has any flaw it is that Gilbert clearly favors the British and French against the Germans, who are seen as the &quot;villains&quot; of the book. Historians tend to disagree about Germany's actions during the First World War - some believe the Germans were the &quot;villains&quot; of the war, others believe that every major European nation shares some of the blame for the conflict. However, the bias is not so strong that it seriously affects the book, and for anyone who is interested in getting a &quot;complete&quot; and wide-ranging overview of the &quot;War to end all Wars&quot; - militarily, politically, socially, culturally, and economically - then Martin Gilbert has written the best one-volume book to date.	2001-07-14
US	45555192	RI33TODKRH1P	0316545112	977998391	One Brief Shining Moment: Remembering Kennedy	Books	2	15	20	N	N	A great writer turns JFK into a modern King Arthur	Make no mistake, William Manchester (1922-), who knew John F. Kennedy personally, can be a great writer at times. His two-volume biography of Winston Churchill (sadly, never to be completed now that Manchester is aging and ill) is superb, and so is \\"The Glory and the Dream\\", his history of the GI generation from 1932-1972. But when it comes to the Kennedys, Manchester's objectivity and tendency to hero-worship simply fails him, and has led to plenty of criticism and controversy over the years. In my opinion, \\"One Brief Shining Moment\\" is easily one of the worst books ever written about President Kennedy, and is an embarrassment to Manchester's otherwise brilliant career. Manchester doesn't just praise JFK in this book, he almost fawns over him, and it's obvious that he sees JFK as a modern King Arthur presiding over a (White House) Camelot. His chapter titles for this book tell it all - \\"There thou layest\\" is his final chapter in which he specifically links Kennedy to the Arthurian legends, and indulges in plenty of purple prose.<br /><br />As in his other Kennedy books, Manchester loathes Lyndon Johnson, and in this work he more clearly links LBJ with Mordred - Arthur's (JFK's) great enemy and the villain of the Camelot (Kennedy) legend - than in his previous Kennedy books. In Manchester's prose, LBJ is little more than a redneck boor, a country hick whose crude habits, such as deer hunting, \\"horrified\\" the urbane, elegant, and intellectual JFK. In Manchester's view Lyndon Johnson was the \\"anti-Kennedy\\" - this despite the view held by many modern (and far more objective) historians that it was Johnson, and not JFK, who was the critical force behind the great Civil Rights and anti-poverty legislation passed in the mid-sixties. This book repeats virtually every legend and myth about JFK as fact - that the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 wasn't really JFK's fault, but the CIA's, President Eisenhower's, etc. Kennedy's womanizing wasn't anything that his predecessors (and successors) haven't done, so what's the big deal? And, of course, if JFK had only lived none of the massive problems of the later sixties would have happened. According to Manchester, Kennedy would \\"definitely\\" have pulled out of Vietnam - hence no Vietnam War, no dead American soldiers or riots on college campuses, etc. If JFK had only lived the civil rights mess - such as the race riots in the mid-to-late sixties - would never have happened, as blacks somehow \\"trusted\\" JFK more than they did Lyndon Johnson, and would therefore have listened to JFK's urgings not to riot in the streets.<br /><br />Of course, Manchester offers virtually no evidence to support these claims - he simply writes them as if they were \\"facts\\" accepted by everyone. In Manchester's rosy view, Kennedy is simply perfect, with almost no flaws or warts (and those few that exist only \\"prove his humanity\\"). If you still believe the Camelot legends of John F. Kennedy's Presidency and still have a romantic view of the man, then you'll LOVE this book, as it takes the Camelot myth and runs wild with it. But if you're looking for a more balanced and fair-minded work about JFK, then this is probably the LAST book you'll want to read. I've read many books about the Kennedys - some favorable and some critical - but this book is easily the least objective and balanced pro-Kennedy account that I've ever read. If you do choose to read this book, I would suggest you then read several other, more balanced Kennedy books. Richard Reeves' \\"President Kennedy: Profile of Power\\" is excellent, as is Herbert Parmet's \\"Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy.\\"	2001-07-13

Basically, how you rate \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" all comes down to how you feel about the Kennedys, as the previous reviews of this book have clearly demonstrated. If you admire the Kennedys, then this book is \\"trash\\" and Hersh's claims about John F. Kennedy's Presidency are \\"wildly exaggerated\\" or \\"just not true\\". But if you don't like the Kennedys, then Hersh's claims are \\"without doubt\\" and \\"undeniably the truth.\\"<br /><br />  Books about John F. Kennedy usually fall into one of these two groups - the scholarly, mostly admiring \\"serious\\" books which concentrate on the issues Kennedy dealt with as President and look only briefly at his many personal flaws; and the so-called \\"sensational\\" books which focus primarily on JFK's wild private life and only briefly examine the major historical events of his term of office (the Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.). I tend to look at Hersh's book somewhat differently - I think that many of Hersh's allegations are indeed true, and there's little doubt (as many other books and sources have confirmed Hersh's allegations), that JFK was anything but a saint in his private life. However, I'm still not convinced that his private behavior had much effect on his judgments and decisions in the great historical moments of his Presidency. For example, does anyone (except his strongest critics) believe that Kennedy seriously sought advice from one of his many mistresses during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, or consulted with them about how to deal with the civil rights movement in the South? The clear impression one gets from this book is that JFK saw his mistresses as a way to have fun and relax, and that he kept them separate from the serious, policy-making side of his job. Of course, that doesn't make what he did morally correct or in any way admirable, but given the many policy failures of other presidents with (presumably) better private behavior, it does tend to indicate that being a saint isn't exactly a requirement tobe an effective president (Bill Clinton also comes to mind in this regard).<br /><br />  Most of Hersh's claims have been made elsewhere, although he does come up with new testimony from ex-Secret Service agents, aides, and others to buttress his arguments. Specifically, the major charges are: 1) That Kennedy, with the help of his sinister, enormously wealthy father, \\"bought\\" the presidency in 1960. Hersh traces the influence of Kennedy's father from the West Virginia presidential primary, where he charges that the Kennedys bribed county sheriffs and other local officials to give JFK the vote over his rival, liberal Senator Hubert Humphrey, a man of modest means who couldn't compete with the Kennedy's under-the-table payments. Next, Hersh alleges that the Kennedys used all of their influence to pressure Democratic delegates to support JFK at the 1960 Democratic Convention. And, finally, Hersh argues that the Kennedys stole the 1960 presidential election itself by stealing enough votes in states like Illinois and Texas to defeat JFK's great rival, Richard Nixon. There was some evidence of major vote-stealing in Illinois (Nixon carried 92 of 101 counties in Illinois but still lost the state by less than 9,000 votes, mainly because of a huge Kennedy vote in Chicago). President Eisenhower encouraged Nixon to contest the results there, but Nixon, in a graceful move, refused to. Hersh implies that the mafia in Chicago, specifically mob boss Sam Giancana, stole the votes necessary for JFK to win in Chicago, and that Kennedy and Giancana privately communicated through a woman they shared sexually, Judith Campbell-Exner. Exner's story has been repeated in other books, and there is little doubt that she and Kennedy had a relationship. However, Illinois alone wouldn't have changed the outcome of the election, and Nixon would still have needed to win another big state to change the result. His best bet may have been in Texas, another state that JFK won by a close margin and where there were also claims of vote fraud (courtesy of Lyndon Johnson, JFK's running mate). However, the Texas angle has never been investigated as thoroughly as the Illinois vote, and we may never truly know who should have won the 1960 presidential election - we can only speculate.<br /><br />  For his second charge, Hersh provides plenty of eyewitness testimony that President Kennedy had a seemingly endless number of mistresses, extramarital affairs, and one-night stands, thus leaving himself open to blackmail from foreign governments or hostile internal forces (such as the mafia). Again, there's considerable evidence from other books that Kennedy did fool around - two of his secretaries were nicknamed \\"Fiddle\\" and \\"Faddle\\" and often took nude swims with him in the White House pool. Again, the real charge is whether or not these women compromised JFK's ability to do his job, and that's harder to prove. That Kennedy treated most of these women like live sex toys is undeniable - he didn't seem to take most of them seriously (nor, according to author Gore Vidal, a relative of Jackie Kennedy, did his wife. According to Vidal, Jacqueline Kennedy often used the word \\"it\\" , not \\"she\\" or \\"her\\", when referring to her husband's many mistresses). Kennedy also supposedly had a fling with a woman who was later suspected of being a spy for the Communist East German government, and who was quickly deported when Bobby Kennedy learned of the suspicions about her. These are serious charges, and Kennedy does seem to have been guilty of, at least, extremely poor judgment.<br /><br />  And, finally, Hersh charges that Kennedy systematically used the power of the Presidency to cover up his shenanigans, thus breaking the law repeatedly and committing criminal acts. If true, this would place Kennedy in the Nixon range of Watergate-type scandals, which means that he should have been impeached. Again, there is little doubt that Kennedy used the Secret Service and other federal agencies to hide his behavior from outsiders, and his brother did use his power as Attorney General to silence embarrassing stories and try to dig up dirt on potential enemies (such as Nixon, the Kennedys had the IRS audit his taxes several times from 1961-1963, with no result). Of course, MANY politicians have done the same, and while it may not be morally right, the Kennedys were neither the first nor the last politicians to do so. Whether this makes them especially evil or sinister is dubious. In short, it is my belief that Hersh's claims, although largely true, still don't provide a clear link between JFK's private life and his public (political) life. Was Kennedy a terrible person? Hersh makes a strong case that the private Kennedy was often a sexually deviant, amoral man. But as for Kennedy the President (and they are different things), I don't believe he was a great President, but he also wasn't the awful leader that Hersh and some others make him out to be. Today many historians rate JFK as about average - in the middle of the pack. And that's about where I would place him, too.

John G. Fuller, who died in 1990, was a regular columnist for the \\"Saturday Review\\" magazine. In the mid-1960's he personally investigated and wrote two separate books on two of the most famous UFO incidents in American history. Both books were bestsellers and both were given considerable publicity because they were written not by some \\"lunatic\\" UFO \\"nut\\", but rather by a respected and well-known reporter who wrote seriously about UFOs. This reprint combines both books into a single volume and should be considered a \\"must\\" for any serious student of ufology.<br /><br />The first book, \\"Incident at Exeter\\", describes a series of fantastic UFO sightings in the small city of Exeter, New Hampshire in the fall of 1965. It all began when Norman Muscarello, a local boy and recent high school graduate, was hitchhiking home along a quiet rural highway outside of town. At around 2:30 am Muscarello was shocked when a large object which gave off an intense red glow rose up from some nearby woods and moved towards him. He banged on the door of a nearby house but there was no answer (the family who owned the farm were not at home at the time), meanwhile farm animals nearby were kicking in their stalls and making loud, frightened noises. The object eventually flew back over the woods, Muscarello caught a car and, badly frightened, made his way to the Exeter police department. He convinced two policemen to return with him to the farm, and this time all three men saw the UFO at close range. Their stories were given national publicity and soon others in the Exeter area were reporting similar objects in the night sky. The Air Force declared that Muscarello and the two policemen had simply seen military planes from a nearby Air Force base on training maneuvers, but all three men, as well as those who had investigated the case (including Fuller), strongly disputed this and said that the Air Force explanation was absurd. Fuller gives a complete description of the Exeter UFO sightings, which went on for several weeks, and he clearly sympathizes with the UFO witnesses (especially Muscarello and the policemen) and criticizes the Air Force explanation.<br /><br />The second book in the volume, entitled \\"The Interrupted Journey\\", is even more important in UFO lore. This is THE first book to make a serious case that credible witnesses were not only seeing UFOs but being abducted by them as well. In September 1961 Betty and Barney Hill were returning from a vacation in Canada. They were driving late at night through the almost deserted White Mountains of New Hampshire when they spotted a bright object in the sky which seemed to be following their car. The object finally came close enough for Barney to stop the car and view it through binoculars, and what he saw terrified him - he claimed to see a UFO with the occupants looking back at him. He ran back to the car and drove away. They soon heard an odd humming sound - and then they were at least two hours farther down the highway with no idea of how they had spent the last two hours. Strangely thinking no more of it, they traveled on to their home near Boston. Soon, however, they both began to have terrible nightmares, and they decided to see a prominent Boston psychiatrist (and UFO skeptic) for help. He put them under hypnosis - and the Hills then both told a remarkable story. The UFO had apparently taken over the couple's minds, causing them to turn off on a side road. The UFO landed in front of them, the aliens came out and took the dazed couple inside their ship and conducted a kind of medical and scientific examination (among other things, they were apparently mystified when they could remove Barney's false teeth, but couldn't remove Betty's real ones!). The aliens were apparently friendly, although Barney was far more scared than Betty, and in the psychiatrist's audiotapes of the hypnosis sessions (which still exist), you can hear Barney screaming with terror as he recounts the story, and the psychiatrist trying to calm him. The couple gave remarkably similar descriptions (under hypnosis) of the ship and its crew. The psychiatrist never believed that the couple had seen or been kidnapped by a UFO for two hours. Instead, he wrote off the experience as the result of severe job stress (for Barney) and the tensions of being an interracial couple who had experienced some bigotry (Barney was black, Betty white). However, Fuller did believe the Hill's story and agreed to write a book about their experience. Few UFO incidents have aroused more controversy and debate than the Hill's encounter, and even some pro-UFO researchers are doubtful of their story. If you're a believer, then you'll find these two books to be a \\"must\\" for your UFO book collection. But even if you don't believe in UFOs, then you'll still find these books to be a good read (or nighttime \\"ghost stories\\") thanks to Fuller's writing skills.	2001-07-07

Far more than the Kennedy brothers or Lyndon Johnson, Humphrey was a crusader for liberal causes even when they were unpopular, and his leadership in the cause of civil rights puts virtually every other major politician of his era to shame. Yet today Humphrey is almost forgotten by most Americans, and other, less worthy men have gained the credit for the social and economic change that should have been his. Carl Solberg, in this solidly-researched, if somewhat pedestrian biography, shows why Humphrey came to be a rather tragic figure in the history of American liberalism. Born in 1911, Humphrey was raised in the tiny town of Doland (population, about 800) on the isolated South Dakota prairie. The dominant figure in his early life was his father, the town pharmacist and \\"token\\" Democrat, whom he adored. Humphrey's childhood was generally happy, but it came to an abrupt end when the Great Depression struck. Both of Doland's banks closed, and other businesses failed as the local farmers and townsfolk couldn't afford to pay their bills. Humphrey's father struggled to keep his drugstore open, and to pay the bills the family had to sell their handsome house and move into a much smaller one. In 1929 Humphrey's father left the dying town and moved to the larger, nearby town of Huron, where the local townspeople at first gave his family the cold shoulder and the already-established pharmacists tried to run him out of business. The Humphreys had to fight to survive and young Hubert, who had dreamed of getting a college degree and leaving South Dakota behind, was forced to leave the University of Minnesota after just one year, earn a pharmacist's license, and help his father run the family drugstore.<br /><br />Although he proved to be a capable druggist and co-manager of the family drugstore,Humphrey disliked the job and after seven years finally told his father that he couldn't do it anymore. He returned to the University of Minnesota, eventually earned a master's degree in political science, and quickly moved into Democratic politics in Minneapolis. At the age of 34 he was elected Mayor, where he rooted out crooks, fought racial and religious intolerance, and helped the labor unions. In 1948 he first achieved the national spotlight with a dramatic speech to the Democratic National Convention in which he forcefully pushed the cause of civil rights for blacks, earning him friends among liberal Democrats but enraging Southern segregationists, who vowed revenge. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948, Humphrey had a rough start, as the angry Southern segregationists who controlled the Senate punished Humphrey for his civil-rights stance by ostracizing and isolating him. But Humphrey refused to be intimidated and stood his ground, eventually winning friends among liberal Northern Democrats and the respect and affection of even the Southerners. Yet time and again Humphrey, always a poor man in a rich man's political game, found himself passed over for Senate leadership posts and the Democratic presidential nomination by wealthier or less-liberal candidates. In 1960 Humphrey's underfunded presidential campaign was crushed by the Kennedys, who (according to Solberg) spent $1.5 million to Humphrey's $23,000 in the West Virginia primary, and bribed county sheriffs to give Kennedy the vote. Humphrey lost the West Virginia primary and was forced to quit the race. In 1964 he was picked as Lyndon Johnson's running mate, but his four years as Vice-President were miserable. Johnson was consistently bullying and even backstabbing to Humphrey, despite his loyal service.<br /><br />Solberg is at his best in this biography in describing how the Vietnam War turned into not only a national tragedy, but a personal tragedy for Humphrey as well. Initially, Humphrey opposed the war and warned Johnson that bombing North Vietnam would not solve the problems there. Instead of heeding Humphrey's wise advice, Johnson punished Humphrey by isolating and humiliating him until he \\"got back on the team\\" and publicly supported the war effort. LBJ also threatened to destroy Humphrey's chances to become president by telling him that he would oppose his nomination at the 1968 Democratic Convention if he publicly came out against the war. However, liberals and antiwar activists were unaware of his predicament, and many of his liberal supporters turned bitterly against him. In 1968 Humphrey finally won the Democratic Party's nomination for president, but the bloody riots outside the Convention Hall between Chicago police and antiwar protestors, combined with a bitter split in the party over the Vietnam War, led to his narrow defeat by Republican Richard Nixon. In 1970 Minnesota returned him to the Senate, but he was defeated again in 1972 and 1976 by lesser-known (and lesser-qualified) Democrats for the presidential nomination. In 1976 he was diagnosed with cancer, and after waging a painful and brave battle against the disease, he died in 1978.<br /><br />Solberg's great insight in this biography is that Humphrey failed to become President because he was both ahead of, and then behind, his times. In the late 1940's and 1950's his fiery speeches on behalf of civil rights and other liberal causes led Democrats to complain that he was too \\"radical\\" and \\"extreme\\" to be elected President - he was too \\"liberal\\" for the country's mood. Yet by the late sixties his support of the Vietnam War led younger liberals to claim he was too \\"conservative\\" and \\"behind the times\\" to be President. Given Humphrey's achievements - Medicare, the Voting Rights Act, and the Peace Corps were just a few of his ideas that Democratic Presidents put into place - many older liberals may regret that they didn't support him for President in 1968, and many younger liberals may wish they currently had a crusader like Humphrey to lead them. I especially enjoyed Solberg's descriptions of Humphrey's family and private life - he was clearly a popular, even beloved, husband, father, and friend to many people. Although Solberg's writing style is rather pedestrian, overall he does a fine job of describing the life of a man who should be rated among the most creative political leaders of the last 75 years.	2001-07-07

And, thanks to the work of Time magazine's first-rate writers and researchers, this book is also superior to many of the mediocre and poorly-researched books published on UFOs. The book offers a good history of the UFO phenomenon, dating back to 1947 when a respected pilot and businessman, Kenneth Arnold, saw what he later described to reporters as nine &quot;flying saucers&quot; buzzing over Mount Rainier in Washington State. Soon many people were reporting strange airborne objects all over the nation, prompting a worried US Air Force to begin a secret investigation that would last until 1969. Despite its slim length, this book does a good job of covering almost every aspect of UFOs, from mysteries such as the nuclear bomb-style explosion in Siberia in 1908 which destroyed a thousand square miles of forest, to most of the better-known UFO sightings in the USA, to the creepy &quot;Men In Black&quot; who have been rumored to try and intimidate UFO witnesses into not publicizing their sightings, to possible explanations for UFOs - from the sensible to the outlandish. The book's authors make no judgements on any of these stories - they simply report them and leave it up to the reader to decide their authenticity. Although other UFO books will provide the reader with a much greater wealth of detail and knowledge, &quot;The UFO Phenomenon&quot; is still a fine introduction into the subject.	2001-07-07
US	45555192	R2KN7UIRXWQYMQ	0449300218	443020119	A Thousand Days	Books	3	29	36	N	N	Welcome to Camelot, American-style	Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (1917-2007) may well qualify as the most prominent American historian of the GI generation. The son of a famous Harvard historian, Schlesinger became a two-time pulitzer-prize winning biographer of liberal Democratic politicians and Presidents. Yet for all of his skills as a historian, Schlesinger wasn't satisfied with merely writing about history - he wanted to make it as well. A diehard, old-fashioned New Deal Democrat, Schlesinger wrote glowingly about Franklin D. Roosevelt and liberal Democrats and criticized their conservative opponents. In 1960 Schlesinger, to the anger of his liberal friends and allies, supported John F. Kennedy (whom many liberals regarded with skepticism) against his old boss, Adlai Stevenson (the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952 and '56, and the great hero of liberal Northern Democrats). He was rewarded when President Kennedy made him the White House's first \\"historian-in-residence\\". As such Schlesinger got to attend most White House meetings and conferences, send memos (usually ignored) to President Kennedy offering advice on the issues of the day, and being a general gadabout. In the process Schlesinger became little more than an employee of the Kennedys, a fact which earned him much criticism from not only conservatives, but also from many younger liberals who came to see him as a hypocrite and elitist who was willing to \\"sell out\\" his liberal ideals for power and prestige.<br /><br />When JFK was assassinated Schlesinger (who loathed Lyndon Johnson) left the White House and wrote his \\"memoir/history\\" of the Kennedy Presidency - entitled \\"A Thousand Days.\\" Although the book became a bestseller and earned Schlesinger a second pulitzer prize, it also has earned a good deal of criticism - much of it justified - for its' lack of objectivity and almost fawning praise of the Kennedys. Those who admire the Kennedys will probably love this book, as it rarely lives up to Schlesinger's promise in the prologue not to \\"hero-worship\\" Kennedy. The mythical, larger-than-life JFK who walks through these pages is well-nigh perfect - he is a wonderful family man, a committed liberal, a graceful intellectual - and probably bears only a passing resemblance to the real flesh-and-blood John F. Kennedy. The numerous, darker revelations which have been made about JFK over the last 45 years (his reckless womanizing, serious health problems and dubious treatments, etc.) are totally ignored here. No doubt JFK had many fine qualities, but anyone wishing for an objective and candid view of Kennedy's strengths AND weaknesses should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Schlesinger also can't help but inject himself into the story as much as possible. Of course, this is a personal memoir rather than a biography, but in my opinion Schlesinger seems to go out of his way to inflate his role in the Kennedy administration. For example, instead of describing Kennedy's efforts to nail down the Democratic presidential nomination at the 1960 Democratic Convention, Schlesinger chooses to describe his own (very) minor role in rounding up support for the Kennedys from liberal delegates. When JFK makes his fateful decision in early 1961 to allow a group of CIA-trained Cuban exiles to invade Cuba to try and overthrow Fidel Castro (the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion), Schlesinger doesn't focus so much on the story behind the invasion or Kennedy's response to it as he does to his own (again, very minor) role in advising Kennedy through the crisis. Schlesinger repeatedly describes going to Kennedy to offer his advice on the major crises of JFK's time in office, and not surprisingly, Schlesinger seems like a prophet in predicting initiatives that would fail (like the Bay of Pigs) and those that would succeed (like the Cuban Missile Crisis). From reading this book you get the impression that Schlesinger was a major player in the White House, when in fact numerous other books have pointed out that Schlesinger did little but take notes, write movie reviews for magazines (with Kennedy's approval), and attend Bobby Kennedy's famous pool parties.<br /><br />That isn't to say, of course, that \\"A Thousand Days\\" isn't worthwhile. It is extremely well-written - Schlesinger is a fine writer - and it does offer a favorable view of the Kennedys which is now out of fashion. After writing \\"A Thousand Days\\" Schlesinger spent the rest of his life defending the Kennedy brothers from their critics, and at a considerable cost to his reputation, although his many books on the Kennedys did earn him a considerable amount of money. If you want to read one of the first \\"insiders\\" accounts of a legendary American Presidency - and a book which played a huge role in the creation of the Kennedy \\"Camelot\\" myth - then you'll love this book. But if you want a more balanced and objective look at the Kennedy Presidency, then you'd be well-advised to look elsewhere - to Richard Reeves' \\"President Kennedy: Profile of Power\\", Herbert Parmet's \\"Jack: The Struggles of John F. Kennedy\\", or Robert Dallek's \\"An Unfinished Life.\\"	2001-07-06

Among them are a moving account of Bobby Kennedy's doomed 1968 presidential bid and a critical look at Reagan's election to the Presidency in 1980. In \\"Marathon\\" Witcover attempts to pull a Teddy White and write the definitive account of the 1976 presidential campaign. White became famous in 1961 with the publication of \\"The Making of the President 1960\\", his bestselling account of the legendary Kennedy-Nixon presidential campaign. White had the advantage of being the first journalist to write an entire book about how we elect (or elected) Presidents in this country so soon after the election he covered. White then wrote an entire series of \\"Making of the President\\" books, covering the campaigns of 1964, 1968, and 1972. By 1976 White was tired of writing about campaigns that he felt made less and less sense and which seemed to be dominated more by primaries and photo ops than by the old-fashioned back-room dealing and campaign barnstorming that he loved to write about. So in 1976 White took a break from covering presidential politics to write his memoirs. That left the field open to other journalists, and Witcover took up the challenge. And while \\"Marathon\\" never equals White's eloquence or gift for grasping the overall theme, or meaning, of a campaign, Witcover does provide an entertaining account of a close, hard-fought race. And 1976 truly provided a wealth of stories - Jimmy Carter's rise from almost total obscurity to defeat a host of better-known Democrats and claim the Democratic nomination, thus proving the power that the primaries now had over the nominating process; George Wallace's last presidential campaign, his former racism and Archie Bunker-type qualities now hobbled or changed by his paralyzing gunshot wound suffered four years earlier; the thrilling fight between President Ford and Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination, a race which was so close itwasn't decided until the actual balloting at the Republican Convention; and Ford's spectacular comeback from a 33-point deficit in the polls in August 1976 to a dead-even race by Election Day in November.<br /><br />Witcover does a marvelous job of explaining the \\"little moments\\" that can mean victory or defeat for a campaign - the consistent bad luck of Morris Udall, an Arizona Congressman and Carter's main rival for the Democratic nomination; Ford's complacency after beating Reagan in the first 4 Republican primaries, allowing himself to ease up on Reagan in the North Carolina primary - which allowed Reagan to pull off a stunning upset, save his campaign, and make a comeback to nearly defeat Ford at the Republican Convention; and Carter's verbal gaffes in the fall campaign - including the famous \\"lust in my heart\\" remark he made to \\"Playboy\\" magazine which led to weeks of ridicule in the national press. My chief problem with this book is its' length - at 700 pages in the paperback edition it is far longer than any of White's books, and includes a great amount of tedious detail that could easily have been left out (does anyone really need to know that George Wallace liked to dump ketchup over everything he ate?). Basically, this book could have used a better editor. However, even given its' length and overattention to detail, \\"Marathon\\" is still the best book you'll find on how television and the primaries allowed Jimmy Carter to become President - something that would never have happened just a few years earlier.	2001-06-23

And while I would agree that White's series is superb, I believe that \\"An American Melodrama\\" is even better - that it is, in fact, the best book about an American presidential camapaign that I've ever read. The book, which covers the presidential campaign of 1968 - one of the most dramatic, emotional, and tragic elections of the twentieth century - was written by 3 British journalists, who then combined their writings into a single book. Although this technique often doesn't work, in \\"An American Melodrama\\" it does so brilliantly, and in fact you'd never know that it was written by three people instead of just one if they didn't tell you in the prologue. The authors cover all of that year's stunning events - Eugene McCarthy knocking President Johnson out of the race, Martin Luther King's murder, Bobby Kennedy's murder, the bloody riots between the antiwar hippies and the Chicago police at the Democratic Convention, the racist third-party candidacy of Alabama's George Wallace, and the down-to-the-wire fall campaign between Democrat Hubert Humphrey and Republican Richard Nixon. What makes this book so outstanding is the author's realism and refusal to be overly respectful or impressed with American politicians, while not descending into the cynicism and harshness of today's political reporting. One of the flaws of Teddy White's books is that he can be overly respectful, even worshipful (especially with the Kennedy brothers) of the political leaders he wrote about. In an \\"American Melodrama\\" we get to see Bobby Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, Lyndon Johnson, and Hubert Humphrey on the Democratic side as they really are - warts and all - without being too cynical or harsh. And on the Republican side the authors give the best analysis of Richard Nixon that I've ever read in any campaign biography - they neither idealize Nixon or are overly harsh. The author's insights of the leading politicians in this book - what makes them tick? - have been proven to be right on-target by subsequent events. This book did generate some controversy in the chapter on Bobby Kennedy's assassination in June 1968. The authors, while definitely showing sorrow and sympathizing with the family, also refused to accept the self-pitying, \\"America has gone to h***\\" attitude that many intellectuals and journalists adopted in the wake of Kennedy's murder. They pointed out that, statistically speaking, the late 1960's were much less violent than earlier decades, and that blaming all of American society and culture because of the acts of a single madman (Sirhan Sirhan, RFK's assassin) was absurd. Although some Americans were offended that a team of British reporters would criticize the American liberal establishment in such a manner, events in the years since have largely proven them to be correct. To sum up, this book's insights into the major politicians of the sixties, combined with the genuine drama and tragedy of the 1968 campaign, makes this book a great read. Highly recommended!ther idealize Nixon or are overly harsh.

As an American history buff who has long admired the books of David Halberstam (\\"The Fifties\\", \\"The Best and the Brightest\\"), I would argue that the \\"Summer of 49\\" is one of Halberstam's best works to date. I was visiting a friend's house when I noticed a copy of the \\"Summer of 49\\" on his bookshelf. My friend, a passionate baseball fan, told me what the book was about. Although I'm not a huge baseball fan (growing up in North Carolina and following the Duke-Carolina rivalry gave me more of an interest in college basketball), I was enough of a fan of Halberstam that I borrowed the book. And, was I pleasantly surprised! Even if you're NOT a big baseball fan you'll still love this book if you're at all interested in American history. Instead of focusing on ERAs, bases stolen, and the other statistics that would appeal only to baseball buffs, Halberstam focuses on the human side of a great sports rivalry - the New York Yankees versus the Boston Red Sox. And in the \\"Summer of 49\\" he gives the story of one of that rivalry's greatest moments - the breathtaking, down-to-the-wire showdown between Joe DiMaggio's Yankees and Ted Williams's Red Sox. As always, Halberstam evokes a sense of nostalgia for the past that's almost overwhelming - reading about DiMaggio's health problems, or Williams's running battles with the vicious, always-critical Boston newspapers, or pitcher Ellis Kinder's bitterness at Red Sox manager Joe McCarthy - you get the feeling that you're right there with them. When I finished I felt awed by DiMaggio's quiet pride in winning the American League pennant and World Series after all of his health problems in 1949, and a genuine sadness at the emotional devastation the Red Sox felt after coming so close to winning the pennant two years in a row, only to lose in such cliffhanging, heartbreaking finales. If you enjoy Halberstam's style of writing, and you enjoy reading about a golden age of American sports (even if you're not a baseball fan) then you'll LOVE this book. A great read!	2001-06-13

One Order of Crow!: Inside the Strangest Presidential Election Finish in American History	Books	5	22	24	N	N	A witty and insightful look at the 2000 presidential contest	Jeff Greenfield is widely recognized as one of the premier political analysts in America. And, with the publication of &quot;Oh Waiter&quot; he proves that he's a terrific writer as well. Greenfield graduated from Harvard Law and went straight to work for Senator Robert Kennedy. After Kennedy's death in 1968 he worked as an aide for several other major politicians before tackling a new career as a political commentator for ABC News. His witty yet shrewd analyses of leading politicians quickly made him into a star. By the 1990's Greenfield was working for CNN. As the book reveals, Greenfield longs for the days before exit polling and other modern techniques allowed the political &quot;experts&quot; to know who was going to win the election hours before the polls even closed. On election night 2000 Greenfield (and many other political junkies) got their wish - a VERY close election - but as Greenfield dryly notes, this election was proof positive that you need to be careful what you wish for. As befits Greenfield's on-air style, &quot;Oh Waiter&quot; educates as well as it entertains. He offers a perceptive insight (and a highly amusing one) into the personalities and weaknesses of Al Gore and George W. Bush, as well as why neither candidate could ever pull away to a comfortable lead (they were mirror images of each other). He describes why John McCain, for all the excitement he generated in the Republican primaries, never really had a chance against Bush and the conservative GOP establishment. The best part of the book, in my opinion, were the two chapters which covered CNN's election night coverage. Again, Greenfield offers both amusing commentary and shrewd insight in equal measure. He is also fair (or at least equally harsh) to both sides, and he isn't afraid to skewer his own profession - the media - for their mistakes either. He vividly explains why the sophisticated election-predicting system all the TV networks used was a disaster waiting to happen, and why itfinally DID happen in 2000. And, last but not least, Greenfield explains why it was virtually impossible for Gore to have won the presidency, even if all the &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios had gone his way (basically, the Republicans simply wanted it more, to get even with the Clintons). If you enjoy reading a book that in the span of a few pages will have you laughing out loud and then will offer some real insight into the workings of the modern American political system (and vice versa), then you'll find &quot;Oh, Waiter&quot; impossible to resist. I know I did - I intended to simply skim through it in my local bookstore and 2 hours later wound up buying it because I simply had to finish it. Like Teddy White's famed classic &quot;The Making of the President 1960&quot;, this book in another 20 or 30 years may itself be seen as a classic look at one of the closest, most exciting - and strangest - presidential elections in American history.	2001-06-06

Although Sheaffer does do a credible job of proving that some of the UFO incidents in his book have a conventional explanation (such as the famous sighting that future President Jimmy Carter had in Georgia in the late sixties, which Sheaffer convincingly shows to have been Venus), some of his other \\"explanations\\" often ignore or twist the evidence to come to the conclusion Sheaffer wants.<br /><br />  For example, Sheaffer describes in detail the famous UFO chase in Portage County, Ohio in 1966 in which a respected policeman, Dale Spaur, and his deputy chased an extremely large and bright object across the county and into Pennsylvania before the strange object \\"flew straight up\\" and vanished. Sheaffer argues that this UFO was clearly the planet Venus, and even uses a map to show that the path Spaur followed as he chased the UFO was actually the path he would have taken if he were following Venus setting on the eastern horizon. Unfortunately, he leaves out some important testimony which contradicts this claim, among them Spaur's assertion (and his deputy's) that the UFO flew directly overhead while they were standing outside their patrol car, the fact that the object was so bright that it lit up the highway in front of them \\"like high noon\\" (Venus certainly isn't that bright!) and that another policeman who observed the object watched the UFO fly directly overhead as he was sitting in his parked car (No star or planet can fly straight over a person's head while they're standing still, be as large as a \\"barn\\", or make the loud \\"humming\\" sounds that Spaur described). Sheaffer simply ignores this testimony - for the obvious reason that it contradicts his \\"explanation\\" of the sighting. And, unfortunately, Sheaffer repeats this pattern in numerous other cases throughout the book - any eyewitness testimony or other evidence that contradicts his explanations is simply ignored.<br /><br />  Sheaffer also has the unfortunate habit of unnecessarily insulting or ridiculing witnesses. He makes several negative comments about Spaur's life after he saw the UFO (Spaur lost his job, began having nightmares about the UFO, and his marriage ended after he violently shook his wife a few weeks after the UFO encounter). Sheaffer seems to be implying that since Spaur has so many personal problems he can't be trusted with his UFO report. What Sheaffer leaves out is that Spaur was a highly respected policeman before the UFO incident, his marriage was stable (his wife said that Spaur \\"just wasn't the same\\" after the sighting, which led to the end of the marriage) and that Spaur suffered enormous public ridicule because he had dared to report a UFO (Spaur later said that even if a UFO landed in his backyard he wouldn't report it for fear of ridicule). Even Spaur's boss, the Chief of Police, strongly defended him. And, not even the Air Force's \\"Project Blue Book\\" staff, who were notorious for debunking all UFO incidents, ever doubted Spaur's credibility or personal honesty, as Sheaffer does.<br /><br />  The main problem I have with this book is that there is a real difference between being a \\"skeptic\\" (in which you approach UFOs with an objective open-mind and regard ALL beliefs about UFOs skeptically, including your own) and a \\"debunker\\" (in which you approach UFOs with a completely closed mind that examines every case with a prearranged agenda designed to \\"prove\\" that every UFO case is explainable, and you simply ignore or twist the actual evidence to prove your point).  Bottom line: Sheaffer's \\"UFO Sightings: The Evidence\\" is worth reading for the correct explanations he gives to some UFO sightings. But the reader should always double-check Sheaffer's \\"explanations\\" for any evidence that has been ommitted or which contradicts Sheaffer's presumably airtight solutions. (I'd recommend reading Jerome Clark's \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" for a more balanced account of the UFO cases which Sheaffer examines). A worthwhile book, but at times a misleading one too.	2001-06-03

In essence, the Report stated that scientists had nothing to gain from taking UFOs seriously and that the entire subject was largely useless to science. It allowed anti-UFO debunkers to publicly dismiss the phenomenon as \\"nonsense\\" and to label UFO witnesses as either liars, fantasizers, or people who were just too ignorant to know what they were seeing in the skies. It also gave the US Air Force the excuse it needed to shut down Project Blue Book, its official investigation of the UFO \\"problem\\", which had been a huge public-relations disaster. The Condon Report was created as a response to the great wave of UFO sightings and incidents that took place in the mid-to-late 1960's. When Project Blue Book dismissed most of these sightings as hoaxes, misindentifications of stars or meteors, or \\"swamp gas\\", even some Congressmen began to suggest that the Air Force wasn't taking the sightings seriously and that a more scientific investigation was needed.<br /><br />The response to these concerns was a government-funded UFO research project based at the University of Colorado and chaired by Dr. Edward Condon, a prominent physicist. At first both believers and skeptics were enthusiastic about the project. The leading pro-UFO groups, such as NICAP and APRO, sent their best UFO reports to the project so they could be studied. Additionally, a field team was created to go out and investigate UFO sightings immediately after they were reported. The leader of these field teams was Dr. Roy Craig. This book is his memoir of his experiences as a field investigator for the Condon Committee. Dr. Craig personally investigated numerous UFO incidents. Among them were such famous cases as the film of two UFOs shot in 1950 on an old home-movie camera in Great Falls, Montana by the manager of the local minor-league baseball team; and a UFO landingin Canada which was supposedly witnessed by a local prospector and mechanic, who claimed that the UFO burned and injured him when he touched it. Craig, a confirmed skeptic, states that nearly all of his on-site investigations left him convinced that no \\"real\\" UFO sightings had occurred - they were simply hoaxes, or some other \\"normal\\" phenomena. Of all the cases he investigated, only the case in which the well-trained crew of a RB-47 US military plane both saw and detected a UFO on radar for several hours impressed him enough to state that the crew had seen a \\"genuine\\" UFO - an unidentifiable flying object. Craig also stoutly defends Dr. Condon from the harsh criticism he experienced after he made several statements (while the project was still working on its \\"unbiased\\" report) to the effect that UFOs were not to be taken seriously and that he thought the entire subject was a bunch of nonsense. Although Craig's conclusions about UFOs will inspire plenty of debate among those who have seriously studied the phenomenon, he does come across in this book as a more open-minded investigator of UFOs than are most skeptics, Dr. Condon included. (However, Dr. Craig does largely ignore the fact that the Condon Report couldn't find solutions to 30% of the cases it examined, and had to list them as \\"unexplained\\").<br /><br />My chief problem with this book lies not in Dr. Craig's skepticism about UFOs, but rather with his writing style . His prose is somewhat pedestrian and the book can be slow going at times. Dr. Craig can turn even the most interesting UFO story into a snoozer. For a serious reader of UFO history this book does offer an invaluable insider's account of how the Condon Report came to its anti-UFO positions; as well as the nearly constant behind-the-scenes feuding between those scientists who were dismissive of UFOs as a serious topic (such as Condon and Craig), and those scientists who thought that the UFO phenomenon represented something both real and extraordinary. But if you're simply a general reader looking for a good book to read about UFOs, then you'd be well-advised to look elsewhere.	2001-06-03
US	45555192	R3VY1VI9A3OEFT	0060390077	155016639	America in Search of Itself: The Making of the President, 1956-1980	Books	5	22	22	N	N	A superb look back at recent American political campaigns	Theodore H. White (1915-1986), who was once described by TIME magazine as the \\"godfather of modern political reporting\\", spent some twenty years (1960-1980) covering presidential politics. After each campaign White would write a book about his adventures and observations among the candidates and events he covered. This series of books - the \\"Making of the President\\" series, earned White a Pulitzer Prize and national fame as a leading commentator on national politics. During these years White came to know, or at least meet, most of the great politicians of the era - from President Eisenhower to the Kennedy brothers (whom he idolized, to great criticism from younger journalists and historians), to big-city bosses and Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. During these years White gradually moved from being a committed liberal Democrat to a more conservative (although not necessarily pro-Reagan or pro-Republican) stance. In \\"America In Search of Itself\\" White attempts to sum up what he discovered during these years not only about our political system and the politicians who run it but about the American people as well. In some ways this is a pessimistic book about the decline of American power and economic strength from the \\"Happy Days\\" of the 1950's to the deep recessions and job layoffs of the late 1970's. White often mourns the passing of the stability and self-confidence that he thought existed in the Eisenhower Fifties and the Kennedy Presidency. Of course, White had no way of knowing that America would recover its power and economic strength in the eighties and nineties, so in this sense the book's pessimism  may seem dated to some readers. However, White (as always) also offers a brilliant description of how television completely changed American politics, and of how the breakup of the big-city Democratic \\"machines\\" (however corrupt they may have been) paved the way for the eventual breakup of the Democratic Party in the late seventies and eighties, (until a guy namedBill Clinton pulled it together again). White writes eloquently of the long-ago 1956 presidential campaign, when our political system seemed much simpler and more exciting, if also less fair to women and racial minorities. White writes that from 1956 to 1980 the control of our political system was taken out of the hands of the \\"professional politicians\\" (the big-city mayors, Governors, and Congressmen) and placed in the hands of advertising executives who could make effective TV Commercials, and crusading idealists (feminists, environmentalists, pro-and-anti abortionists, etc.) who came to dominate the primaries which now choose the presidential candidates of both parties. The final section of the book is a description of the 1980 presidential campaign between Republican Ronald Reagan and Democrat Jimmy Carter. As always, White's observations about this campaign are usually on-target and eloquent, if also more harsh and negative than his earlier \\"Making of the President\\" books. The impression White gives is that our political system was on the wrong track in the early eighties, and that the \\"simpler\\" political system that existed in the 1950's was better. However, White offers no real solutions for how to reform the current system, and perhaps, given how things have turned out since this book was published in 1982, it's better that the system wasn't changed. Overall, this book is a \\"must\\" for anyone who's interested in recent American history and politics.	2001-05-31
US	45555192	R3TDYWAW2WUD48	0802135307	951610426	1968 in America: Music, Politics, Chaos, Counterculture, and the Shaping of a Generation	Books	4	25	26	N	N	A misleading title, but a good book for political buffs	Charles Kaiser's \\"1968 In America\\" is going to be a big disappointment to those who bought it thinking that they would learn a great deal about the culture and music of the sixties. Only one chapter of the book looks at the music and counterculture of the sixties in any detail, and the other chapters only briefly mention them. Anyone who wants to learn more about sixties music and the counterculture should look elsewhere. But if you're a political buff like me then this book should be a delight.<br /><br />The great majority of this book is taken up with describing the bitter fight for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1968. It was a fight that came down to four men: President Lyndon Johnson, whose policies in Vietnam had turned many Americans against him (especially the young), but who still had the support of the old-fashioned big-city mayors who used to run the Democratic Party, but whose influence even in 1968 was declining. Waiting in the wings if Johnson withdrew was his talkative Vice-President, Hubert Humphrey. But the real focus of the book is on Eugene McCarthy, the eloquent, intellectual, but also enigmatic and curiously passive Senator from Minnesota. Many people disliked McCarthy and considered him to be a snob and too \\"lazy\\" to be President, but as Kaiser demonstrates it was McCarthy who had the guts to join the antiwar movement and oppose Johnson when most of the \\"experts\\" thought it was political suicide. McCarthy's gamble paid off when he nearly defeated Johnson in New Hampshire, giving the President a death blow which led to his sudden withdrawal from the campaign a couple of months later. However, McCarthy's surprise showing led Bobby Kennedy, the \\"Prince-in-Waiting\\" to enter the race. This triggered a bitter, no-holds-barred war of words and emotions between McCarthy and Kennedy and their supporters. In the end this fight became so nasty that it would probably have prevented either man from beating Vice-President Humphrey at the Democratic Convention.<br /><br />However, Bobby Kennedy's murder in Los Angeles in June 1968, following his narrow victory over McCarthy in the California primary, changed the race all over again, and gave, Kaiser argues, McCarthy one last chance to win the nomination. Typically, McCarthy procrastinated and quoted poetry while Humphrey wooed the delegates he needed to win. The book loses much of its passion after that, and Kaiser's description of the fall campaign between Humphrey and his Republican opponent, Richard Nixon, isn't nearly as interesting as his descriptions of the McCarthy-Kennedy feud. In short, if you like politics you'll love this book, and if you don't - well, then don't buy it.	2001-05-31
US	45555192	R1VJLL6KAAA9FE	1568491433	409760275	The Making of the President, 1960	Books	5	26	27	N	N	One of the best books about American politics ever written	This book, published in 1961, has long been considered to be a classic among political buffs and those who have any interest in how the American political system works, or once worked. Theodore White (1915-1986), who was once described by TIME magazine as the \\"godfather of modern political reporting\\", created a whole new way of covering presidential campaigns with this pulitzer-prize winning book. Before this book, reporters tended to cover presidential campaigns - the presidential primaries, the national political conventions, and the fall campaign - as if they were unconnected, separate events. White revolutionized political reporting by seeing these events as simply parts of a whole - he saw the primaries, conventions, and fall campaigns as linked together, as if they were chapters in a good novel. White also changed political reporting by writing extensively about the behind-the-scenes planning, strategizing, and organizing that occurred in presidential campaigns before the first primary was ever held.<br /><br />White spent most of 1960 traveling with all of the candidates, from lonely campaign stops in the Wisconsin and New Hampshire primaries (where sometimes just a handful of people greeted the candidate he was covering), to the excitement of Election Night 1960, which was the closest presidential election night of the twentieth century (with the exception of the 2000 Bush-Gore race). White is a marvelous writer, and his descriptions of the personalities, the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, the momentum shifts, and the infighting, tactics, and strategies that make up a presidential campaign set the standard for a whole new generation of political reporters. White covers politics the way a good sportswriter covers baseball or football or basketball - he makes it appear exciting and glamorous.<br /><br />I do have one problem with the book, and that is White's obvious bias towards John F. Kennedy. In his memoirs (published in 1978), White admitted that he gradually lost all objectivity when it came to JFK and that he came to idolize Kennedy, to the point that he was actually writing some of his campaign speeches - a gross lack of professionalism for a journalist. On the other hand, White also admitted that he strongly disliked Richard Nixon and had deliberately set Nixon up as the \\"villain\\" of the book, just as he made Kennedy the \\"hero\\". As a result White often leaves out damaging information about JFK (any mention of Kennedy's well-known womanizing or health problems, accusations of vote-buying in the West Virginia primary or vote-stealing in the general election, were left to later historians to write about). Poor Nixon, on the other hand, is looked at very critically by White - in White's version Nixon makes so many mistakes (and Kennedy is so perfect) that you wonder why the election was so close. In fact, the legend that Kennedy's brief Presidency was a kind of modern \\"Camelot\\" started with this book. Having said that, I also believe that White's skills as a writer and perceptive observer of American politics more than makes up for this weakness, and the \\"Making of the President 1960\\" should be required reading for anyone who is interested in the great game of American politics. This book's status as a classic work about a legendary presidential campaign makes it an absolute must for any political history buff.	2001-05-31

One Order of Crow!: Inside the Strangest Presidential Election Finish in American History	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A witty &amp; insightful look at the 2000 Presidential Election	Jeff Greenfield is one of the premier political analysts in America, and as this book proves, he's also a terrific writer. I originally was going to &quot;skim&quot; this book in a local bookstore and wound up spending two hours in the store reading it before I decided that I simply had to buy it and finish it. There are already several books out in print about last year's marathon, history-making presidential race, but this one is by far the best. Greenfield manages to combine both a serious analysis of the election - why Bush and Gore were so perfectly matched as opponents (they mirrored each other's strengths and weaknesses), why the South voted Republican while the North went Democratic, why Bush won (and Gore lost), the &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios (and why he believes that Bush would have won the election even if all the &quot;what-ifs&quot; had broken Gore's way), and even why John McCain couldn't defeat Bush despite his huge wins in the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries - with a delightful, biting sense of humor that shines through on every page. Greenfield's analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Bush and Gore's personalities is both hilarious and on-target, as are his comments on the supporting players from Bill Clinton to Katherine Harris. And, as the title suggests, Greenfield doesn't spare his own profession - the media - from his barbs. His two chapters on covering the election night for CNN are by themselves worth the price of the book. If you're looking to buy just one book about one of the closest (and strangest) presidential elections in history, then &quot;Oh, Waiter&quot; is by far the best choice. Not only will you learn a great deal about the 2000 campaign and the &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; battles that you didn't know about before, but you'll also find yourself laughing out loud at many of Greenfield's comments. A great book!	2001-05-30
US	45555192	R1YFWZV5AIRYFB	067141741X	83443118	Thomas E. Dewey and His Times	Books	5	23	24	N	Y	An excellent study of a forgotten political giant	Thomas E. Dewey, unfortunately, is probably best remembered by most Americans as the little fellow who lost the 1948 Presidential election to Harry S. Truman in one of the greatest upsets in American history. But thanks to the work of Richard Norton Smith, we can now see Dewey for what he really was - a crusading, crime-busting district attorney; perhaps the best governor New York State ever had; and the man who \\"modernized\\" the Republican Party and allowed it to survive through the Depression years and the 1940's. Dewey grew up in a small town in Michigan (his father owned and published the local newspaper), and his rise to fame and fortune came remarkably fast. A compulsive workaholic and \\"neat freak\\", Dewey graduated from the University of Michigan and Columbia University Law School in the 1920's. He briefly considered a career as a singer - he had an award-winning baritone voice and liked to sing Broadway tunes in his bathtub - but decided that the law would be a more stable and suitable career. In 1928, he married a stage actress and started a promising legal career in New York City (although he never really liked the Big Apple, and in 1939 he bought a large farm 65 miles north of Manhattan and happily became a weekend farmer and country squire).<br /><br />In 1933 Dewey, only 31, became a federal and then special prosecutor in New York City and sent several gangsters to prison. In 1937 he was elected District Attorney for Manhattan, and he soon achieved national fame as the \\"gangbuster\\" - the honest lawyer who sent dozens of famous mafia leaders to jail. His most famous target was \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, the mafia boss of all New York and who was even more powerful than Al Capone. Dewey's conviction of Luciano (for running a massive prostitution racket in the New York/New Jersey area) made him a national hero and propelled him into presidential politics at the incredible age of 38. His nickname, the \\"gangbuster\\", became the name of a popular radio series based on hisfight against the mob, and Hollywood even made movies about him. In 1940 he ran for the Republican presidential nomination and nearly won, despite his youth and inexperience. In 1942 he was elected Governor of New York. During his twelve years as governor he passed the first state civil rights laws in America, lowered taxes AND cut a budget deficit in half, founded the State University of New York, greatly improved the state's mental institutions, and established the New York Thruway. He also rooted out political crooks and ran a remarkably honest administration. In 1944 he was the GOP presidential candidate and came closer to defeating Franklin D. Roosevelt than any of his four Republican opponents. In 1946 he was re-elected governor by the greatest margin in New York's election history to that time. Dewey's great moment was supposed to have been in 1948, when the GOP nominated him for president for a second time. Dewey was considered to be a sure bet to defeat President Harry S. Truman and restore the Republicans to the White House. All the polls showed Dewey winning easily, and to avoid losing votes Dewey ran a vague campaign and refused to mention Truman's name - even as Truman criticized and even ridiculed him in speech after speech. This was a costly mistake - Truman won a narrow victory in perhaps the greatest election upset of all time. At the age of 46, Dewey was a political \\"has-been.\\"<br /><br />Smith does a wonderful job of explaining why, despite Dewey's honesty, intelligence, and obvious leadership skills he was never able to win the White House. Partly this was due to his personality - many people felt him to be cold and calculating, a short man with a bad temper and an arrogant attitude towards others. Smith fills this biography with plenty of delicious quotes (Dewey's secretary -  \\"He was as cold as a February icicle\\"), and he also offers a superb history of the Republican Party in its lean years between the 1920's and the Eisenhower Fifties. Several parts of this book are so well-written  - such as the first chapter covering Election Night in 1948, or the section describing Dewey's beloved farm of Dapplemere in upstate New York and the community of Quaker Hill it was located in - that you get the feeling you're actually there. Although Dewey will probably always be remembered more for his epic 1948 election upset than for his substantial achievements, Smith's biography will at least ensure that those who read this book will come away with a much better appreciation for the man and for what he accomplished. A terrific book!	2001-04-22
US	45555192	R2GY1JZHSAAHRC	0395139384	870765853	Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A. Taft	Books	5	33	33	N	N	An outstanding political biography in every way!	Simply put, this is the best biography of an American political figure that I have ever read. The book focuses on the life and political career of Robert A Taft (1889-1953) of Ohio, one of the most powerful - and unluckiest - men ever to sit in the US Senate. In the late 1950's a Senate committee named Taft as one of the five greatest Senators in history. The son of a US President, Taft, like John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush, was the product of a great political family. In the 1920's Taft got married (to the daughter of a close friend of his father's), served in the Ohio state legislature, and appeared to have a great political future. But then the Great Depression struck, and Taft, a fiercely loyal Republican and a diehard pro-business conservative, fell on hard times. Patterson does a wonderful job of describing Taft's ultimate tragedy - that while America changed dramatically during the Depression (from conservative Republican to liberal Democrat, from belief in small government to belief in the welfare state) Taft refused to alter his pre-depression views, and thus was prevented from ever winning the Presidency.<br /><br />In 1938 Taft was elected to the US Senate, where he soon became the leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He was re-elected in 1944 and 1950 and became one of the most respected, powerful, and controversial politicians in the nation. Franklin D. Roosevelt and many liberal Democrats AND liberal Republicans (especially New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, with whom Taft waged a bitter 12-year war for control of the GOP) despised and ridiculed him, yet many conservative Republicans and even some Democrats (including, privately, Harry S. Truman) came to respect and admire him for his political courage, high intelligence, and blunt honesty - even when it hurt him with the voters. In 1940 and 1948 Taft was a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination but lost to liberal Republicans from New York. In 1952 he made hislast, strongest try for the Presidency, but narrowly lost to Dwight Eisenhower at a bitterly divided Republican convention. He died suddenly from cancer in 1953. Thanks to the skills of James Patterson, the reader is given an in-depth, well-rounded view of this forgotten political giant. The writing is both eloquent and detailed, and Patterson does not forget to include the human face behind an often cool and private man. Patterson is also admirably objective - he offers praise or criticism of Taft when he feels it is necessary, but he never allows his own views to get in the way of his story. Whether you're interested in high political drama that no novel can match, or simply looking at the human face behind a major politician who was often considered to be \\"cold\\" and \\"colorless\\" in his day, \\"Mr. Republican\\" is as good as it gets...this book should provide any reader with many days of reading pleasure.	2001-04-22
US	45555192	R3QODXJFQP6XD1	0345345258	505208885	Project Blue Book	Books	3	18	18	N	N	A "middle-of-the-road" UFO Book	This book, originally published in 1976, offered readers one of the first looks at the (then) recently declassified, once top-secret files of Project Blue Book, the US Air Force's official investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Blue Book was originally named Project Sign and was created in late 1947 in the wake of the first widely publicized UFO sightings, including Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting of nine \\"flying saucers\\" near Mt. Rainier, Washington. In 1948 the name was changed to Project Grudge, and finally in 1951 it was given the name of Blue Book, which it would retain until it was shut down for good in 1969. Brad Steiger, a UFO researcher with some strange beliefs about the paranormal (read his \\"Mysteries of Time and Space\\", an often bizarre book), does a decent job of editing the book, which is basically the files (usually printed verbatim) of several famous UFO incidents which Blue Book investigated from 1948 to the mid-1960's.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is weakened by Steiger's insistence on featuring several cases that even prominent ufologists such as Jerome Clark and J. Allen Hynek believed could be explained as \\"normal\\" phenomena. One example is the famous Mantell crash in Kentucky in January 1948. Captain Mantell, a veteran fighter pilot, was ordered to intercept a UFO over Fort Knox. He climbed to 25,000 feet and reported that he was chasing a metallic object of \\"tremendous size\\" - and then the airbase lost contact with him. His plane crashed a few moments later and Mantell was killed. Although some newspapers and wild rumors claimed that Mantell had been shot down by a UFO \\"Death Ray\\", it is now almost certain that Mantell was chasing a Skyhook balloon, which in 1948 was a top-secret project which Mantell would not have been aware of. His plane was not equipped with oxygen, and once he reached 25,000 feet he passed out and then crashed. Steiger, however, insists that the Mantell case is \\"unresolved\\" despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. He also insists that several other well-known cases are still \\"unexplained\\" and wastes many pages on them with files from Blue Book, this in spite of evidence (again, supplied mostly by ufologists) that the cases do have a more \\"normal\\" explanation.<br /><br />However, Steiger does give plenty of space to other, more important cases that are still unexplained despite the best efforts of skeptics and ufologists alike. The two best sections of the book, in my opinion, are the Blue Book files from Kenneth Arnold's famous 1947 sighting that started the UFO phenomenon, and the classic 1964 incident in Socorro, N.M., in which a respected policeman witnessed a UFO land and saw several \\"crewmen\\" in strange uniforms outside the craft. When the \\"crewmen\\" saw him they returned to the UFO and it took off, burning nearby bushes and leaving landing marks in the ground. For these cases alone Steiger's book is worth buying, although his insistence that the Mantell crash and some others are still \\"unexplained\\" doesn't help increase his credibilty with more skeptical readers who are familiar with the UFO phenomenon.	2001-04-22

Allen Hynek's &#34;UFO Experience&#34; probably does qualify as the most important study of the UFO phenomenon ever written. Why? Unlike most UFO books, which are written by &#34;true believers&#34; who look uncritically at UFOs and whose authors have little or no scientific expertise, Hynek's &#34;UFO Experience&#34; has the scientific credentials and prestige to be taken seriously. Dr. Hynek was a distinguished astronomer at Northwestern University in Chicago (he served many years as the Chair of the Astronomy Department). He spent over twenty years (1948-1969) as the chief scientific consultant to the US Air Force's various research groups assigned to investigate UFO cases (Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book).  What makes Hynek especially credible is that he started out as a debunker - he thought UFO's were &#34;nonsense&#34; and helped the Air Force to debunk most sightings. But as the years passed Hynek gradually became convinced that some UFO reports were not hoaxes or weather balloons or stars or some other &#34;normal&#34; phenomena and that they might represent something extraordinary - even ET visitation from other planets. In the late 1960's he became openly critical of how Blue Book's staff was handling the UFO reports it was receiving. (In many cases Blue Book's staff didn't make even a brief investigation of a UFO sighting - they simply made up an explanation and filed it away). When the Condon Report was published in 1969 and stated that the UFO phenomenon was &#34;useless&#34; to science, Hynek decided to set up his own organization - with as many credible scientists as possible - to continue to study UFO reports in a serious and scientific way. In 1972 he published the &#34;UFO Experience&#34; in part as a rebuttal to the Condon Report's dismissal of the UFO phenomenon. He points out thatalthough the Condon Report claimed that there was no evidence that UFOs represented anything other than hoaxes and/or misidentifications of known aerial objects, the Report couldn't find &#34;normal&#34; explanations for nearly one-third of the UFO incidents it examined, and had to list them as &#34;unsolved&#34;.  The &#34;UFO Experience&#34; still makes what many people believe to be the strongest scientific argument that UFO reports deserve serious study by qualified scientists. Much of the book discusses the &#34;Close Encounter&#34; UFO sightings which clearly fascinated Hynek. A &#34;Close Encounter of the First Kind&#34; was a UFO observed at extremely close range - within 500 feet. Hynek notes that the closeness of the object helps eliminate the possibility that the witness saw an &#34;ordinary&#34; object - an airplane or a star, for example. A &#34;Close Encounter of the Second Kind&#34; is one in which the UFO physically interacts with the witness - their car shuts off, the UFO leaves burn marks on the ground, etc. And a &#34;Close Encounter of the Third Kind&#34; is one in which the witness actually sees &#34;UFOnauts&#34; either inside or outside the UFO. This last category was used as the title of Steven Spielberg's famous 1978 movie - Spielberg was an admirer of Hynek and gave him a cameo role in the movie. The book is well-written, but it is a &#34;scientific&#34; work and the reader should know that it sometimes contains technical and scientific language and theories. Dr. Hynek pulls no punches in his criticism of the Condon Report or other scientists who choose to ignore the evidence he cites. In short, although nearly 30 years have passed since it was published, Hynek's &#34;UFO Experience&#34; remains one of the best-argued scientific examinations of the UFO phenomenon. If you're interested in learning about UFOs, then this book is a good place to start. (A good &#34;companion&#34; volume to this book is the &#34;Hynek UFO Report&#34;, publishedfive years after the &#34;UFO Experience&#34; and which discusses actual UFO cases taken directly from the files of Project Blue Book).	2001-04-21
US	45555192	R2AXMS0PE1X2S1	0780800974	506874099	The UFO Encyclopedia : The Phenomenon from the Beginning (2 Volume Set)	Books	5	29	30	N	N	An "instant classic" in the study of UFOs	Quite simply, this is THE book to buy if you're interested in learning about the UFO phenomenon. Many UFO books are often written by \\"true believers\\" with dubious credentials, and as a result they feature little or no research to support the author's claims. However, Jerome Clark is a respected UFO historian whose books have won awards from the New York Public Library, and even UFO skeptics regard him as a legitimate UFO researcher and historian. An abridged version of this encyclopedia (\\"The UFO Book\\") won the prestigious Benjamin Franklin Award in the Science/Environment category from the Independent Book Publishers Association, and this two-volume encyclopedia was praised by \\"Library Journal\\" magazine, which recommended the encyclopedia to public and academic libraries. Clark has packed this encyclopedia with a massive amount of research and plenty of references to back up his arguments. And this is a true encyclopedia - the 273 articles cover, alphabetically, almost every major UFO sighting since the 1890's, as well as the major theories that are used to explain UFO sightings, and biographies of almost every major ufologist and skeptic in the field. Although Clark is a \\"believer\\" in the sense that he tends to side with those who believe that UFOs represent something real and extraordinary, he is fair to the skeptics and debunkers and does include their explanations for each sighting, even though he often disagrees with it. However, he does agree with their explanations for some UFO cases (such as the 1948 \\"Gorman Dogfight\\"), and his fair-mindedness permeates the book. It is this even-handedness that makes the \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" stand out from most other UFO books. If you want a handy reference book that will answer almost any question you have about UFOs, then this is the only book you'll ever need. And, as a rebuttal to those who believe that UFOs are \\"nonsense\\" and not to be taken seriously, Clark's \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" presents a mighty challenge. If you couldonly buy just one UFO book for your personal library, then the \\"UFO Encyclopedia\\" is by far the best choice - I have no doubt that it will be the standard reference book for years, if not decades, to come.	2001-04-13

Ruppelt : Summer Of The Saucers	Books	2	5	6	N	Y	Something of a Disappointment	I have always enjoyed reading books that look at the UFO Phenomenon from an \\"historical\\" perspective. I was, therefore, looking forward with great anticipation to reading Wendy Connors and Michael David Hall's \\"Summer of the Saucers\\". The book claims to be both a chronicle of the great UFO flap of 1952 (the greatest year of UFO sightings in American history), and a biography of Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the legendary supervisor of the US Air Force's Project Blue Book.<br /><br />Blue Book was the third code name for the US government's official investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Following the first widely-publicized UFO sightings in 1947, the Air Force established \\"Project Sign\\" to try and discover if there was anything to the sightings, or if it was simply a form of mass hysteria. In 1948 Project Sign sent a top-secret \\"Estimate of the Situation\\" to the Pentagon which stated that UFOs were a real phenomenon and were advanced alien spacecraft. The Air Force rejected this analysis, fired most of the staff, and changed the code name from Sign to \\"Grudge\\". From 1949-1951 Project Grudge spent most of its time debunking all UFO reports and publicly dismissing the phenomenon. However, in the early 1950s the wave of UFO reports to the Air Force reached an all-time high (it has never been equaled since), and so the Air Force reorganized the project yet again. This time they increased the staff and budget, renamed it Project Blue Book, and appointed a young but talented USAF officer, Ruppelt, to supervise it. From 1951-1953 Ruppelt presided over a kind of \\"golden age\\" of UFO investigations; during this period Project Blue Book took UFO sightings seriously and investigated them in an objective and fair manner.<br /><br />Ruppelt managed to investigate some of the most famous UFO sightings in history - the famed \\"Lubbock Lights\\" in Texas, the UFO home movies shot in Utah and Montana, and the great \\"Invasion of Washington\\" in July 1952 when UFOs were seen above the nation'scapital and were detected by multiple radars at two airports in Washington. Although Ruppelt's story and the 1952 sightings provide the basis for a great book, \\"Summer of the Saucers\\" sadly isn't it. The book has the feel of being a hastily put together, self-published effort. The editing is poor - there are numerous spelling errors, the photos are often grainy and difficult to discern, and the author's writing style is simplistic and about on the level of a high-school senior's research paper. Letters from Ruppelt's relatives are simply printed verbatim in the text, without any commentary or analysis from the authors - and the letters often take up several entire pages. Ruppelt himself was certainly a leading figure in ufology, but the book relentlessly praises him and offers few real insights into his career or his feelings about the UFO phenomenon. As a biography, \\"Summer of the Saucers\\" is simplistic and shallow; as a study of the greatest UFO flap in American history, it provides some newly declassified government files but little else that is new or original. For a serious student of ufology the book may be worth buying just for the new material it provides, but for those who have enjoyed reading the works of J. Allen Hynek, Jerome Clark, and Kevin Randle, this book will almost certainly be a disappointment. In fact, the best book written about the early fifties and ufology remains Ruppelt's own memoir, \\"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\\" - I would recommend reading it over this latest \\"biography\\".	2001-04-03
US	45555192	R2EFT3HP82WILN	0425151174	553604651	Watch the Skies!	Books	4	16	19	N	Y	One of the Best Books by a UFO "Skeptic"	\\"Watch the Skies\\" is simply one of the best books by a UFO skeptic that I've read. Unlike debunkers such as Philip Klass and Robert Sheaffer, who unnecessarily ridicule witnesses and often ignore evidence which contradicts their \\"explanations\\" (which, of course, is a failing of many \\"believers\\" as well) Peebles is fair to both sides. What makes this book especially appealing, to believer and skeptic alike, is that it is one of the few \\"historical\\" works on UFOs - it treats UFOs as a historical phenomenon and not simply a random series of sightings and photographs. The only other book to do this, to my knowledge, is David Jacob's \\"The UFO Controversy in America\\" which was published a quarter-century ago. My only complaint with this book is that Peebles' \\"explanations\\" for most UFO sightings lack depth and often are of the \\"armchair investigator\\" variety. Anyone who has read a great deal about the sightings he describes will find plenty to argue with. However, as a synopsis of the skeptic's viewpoint (that all UFO sightings can be explained as weather balloons, birds, mirages, stars, ball lightning, and, failing all else, hoaxes), this book is as about as good as it gets. Recommended.	2001-04-02
US	45555192	R5TIK21NO552L	0380813831	348902376	Scientific Ufology: Roswell and Beyond--How Scientific Methodology Can Prove the Reality of Ufos	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An excellent, "serious" study of the UFO Phenomenon	Unlike many self-proclaimed \\"ufologists\\", Dr. Kevin Randle (along with a few others such as Jerome Clark and Richard Hall) is a true UFO researcher with the credentials and background to be taken seriously. His latest work, \\"Scientific Ufology\\" is one of his best books. Using extensive on-site research and displaying an objective stance that is often rare in this field of study, he reviews a number of famous UFO sightings such as the 1957 Levelland sightings in Texas and the Trent photographs taken in Oregon in 1950. He makes a strong case that these incidents cannot be written off as hoaxes or misinterpretations of normal phenomena such as ball lightning or weather balloons. He also offers a strong rebuttal of UFO debunkers such as Phil Klass and Curtis Peebles. Although the book is not as in-depth as some of his other UFO works, this book by Randle is an excellent place for a beginner or general reader to get a well-written and serious look at some of the most famous UFO sightings of the last fifty years.	2001-03-29
