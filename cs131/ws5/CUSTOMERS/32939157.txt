Undeveloped stories about their exploits are all over the place. Continuity is lacking, making it very difficult and annoying to follow without having to go back to previously stated facts (or never stated) to understand things clearly. The real sorry part is that this had potential to make a really good book from a number of differnt angles, all of which could have been woven into a marvelous tapestry. Unfortunately, Mr Lidz lacks the knowledge of weaving and flow. To bad.

US	32939157	R1A5C2SR5LNGC9	0810913062	820335774	The Great Book of Magic, Including 150 Mystifying Tricks you can Perform	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A Picky Reader from New York	Beyond being an extremely attractive book, I found it enormously interesting,informative, and plain old fun. It covers the history of Magic, tells about all the Great Masters of Magic and how they actually did a number of their most famous tricks, illusions, and such.  The book also has a section for lay people such as myself which tells and shows how we can actually perform a great number of magic tricks and illusions (and it really works).  If you enjoy magic get this book.	2003-06-08
