Being a fan of San Francisco history, I was surprised to see a book dedicated to one quiet corner of the City (where is a volume on the Haight-Ashbury or the Mission District??).  Once I picked this one up, I literally could not put it down.  The pictures of long-gone cattle and sheep drives (all within the city limits of SF) are intriguing.  It was fascinating to read how the neighborhood has evolved with the businesses located there--from the slaughterhouses and tanneries, to the shipbuilders, to the Naval Shipyard, right up to the present transformation that is emerging as a result of the Third Street Muni line.  Best of all, the author has her own roots in the neighborhood, and tells the story with the warmth and sincerity that only first-hand knowledge brings.  It's not a tourist piece, though, since the author frankly acknowledges that the neighborhood continues to face a variety of social and economic challenges.  If you read a history of the Marina or Chinatown, or the Castro, you know pretty much how the story will play out, but not so with this one!  In the end, it is one of the most informative books that I have ever read on a City neighborhood.	2005-09-26

From a small-town country store in the Northern California wine region, comes a great collection of recipes and entertaining ideas using a variety of seasonal products.  Authors Carrie Brown and John Werner (with a wonderful assist from cookbook pro Michael McLaughlin) have compiled the very best of seasonal recipes and menu ideas used in the Jimtown Store and its catering business.  The recipes are clear and easy to follow (though I wish that the publisher had worked harder to print the COMPLETE recipe on 1 or 2 facing pages--flipping the page in the middle of food prep is a real hassle!).  Overall, though, it is a nicely written volume, which provides ideas for springtime suppers, autumn tailgate parties, Fourth of July barbecues, as well as holiday meals.  There is an extensive chapter on salads of all sorts, plus another on sauces, condiments, and relishes, just to give us a few new twists on some old stand-by themes.  There are some great weekend ideas in the chapter entitled Breakfast Baking.  I've already made the maple-glazed meatloaf for dinner (leftovers make terrific sandwiches), and am now planning Grilled Steak with Backyard Bourbon Marinade as well as Apple-Buttermilk Slaw for some weekend lunch guests.  Just in time for summer entertaining, this book is destined to become a year-round classic in my kitchen!	2002-05-09

Rick Rodgers has done it again--taken a great topic (like his past books on Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas) and covered it in a way that makes everything simple, easy, and enjoyable--EVEN FOR THE COOK!<br />He gives a nice overview of the equipment available today and some suggested maintenance (yes, you really DO have to wash the grill and the kettle cover every now &amp; then!), plus a discussion of the different fuel sources, and why some are better than others in different situations.  His warm, familiar writing style comes through loud &amp; clear, but best of all are the recipes!!<br />His BBQ Sauce 101 (also taught in his grilling class), will allow both old-timers and new-comers alike to draw praise from their guests.  It goes together in a snap, and although it smells quite pungent, the flavor is delicious, mellow, and not at all hot.  Peaches &amp; Bourbon Sauce is great on grilled chicken pieces, and he offers a fool-proof recipe for grilled, butterflied leg of lamb, a must for any serious cook who wants to try something more than just burgers and hot dogs.  He also includes summer-perfect beverages, appetizers, side dishes (something else to serve alongside your own favorite potato salad!), and a great array of shortcake &amp; cobbler desserts. (The Peach-Melba Bread Pudding is good enough to eat for breakfast if there are any leftovers!)<br />I bought my copy of BARBECUES 101 over Memorial Day weekend, and it's already filled with the splatters of many relaxing meals prepared for family and friends.	2001-06-12

He takes us beyond the usual barbecue fare to a higher level, with a tangy, tasty Southwestern twist.  (Fear not, though--there are also plenty of recipes here for those who prefer meals a little more on the mild side!)  One of my favorites recipes is the one for Grilled Fish Tacos with Citrus Slaw--I put it together on a cold January day, and it was delicious.  The Lime Cream Sauce, used in many recipes, is simple to make, and keeps well in a plastic squirt bottle in the fridge, thus enabling the cook to zip up a variety of other dishes with little effort.  Another great entry is Chili Meatballs with Hot Jelly Pepper Dipping Sauce--a marvelous new take on the old cocktail meatballs that were glazed with a chili sauce/grape jelly mixture!  The Sweet Potato-Corn Salad with Honey-Mustard Dressing is fantastic whether you use the grill or one of the alternative prep methods.  McLaughlin offers a variety of beverage and dessert recipes as well, along with suggestions for pairing up different entries into a well-planned meal or party.  Sidebars discuss some of the ingredients unique to Southwest cooking, and offer practical hints for distinguishing between good, better, and best--as well as what should be avoided.  As usual, McLaughlin's warm writing style comes through on each and every page.  This is a must-have for anyone who would like to prepare something more interesting than just grilled burgers &amp; chicken breasts, regardless of the season.	2001-01-13

He leads us on this expedition  while sharing some of his innermost feelings &amp; fears (which are often  100% in sync with our own) on each step of the journey.<br />Interwoven in the  account of his own family's life (parts of which we already know, as  faithful Greene readers since the 1970s), he tells us the story of Paul  Tibbets, the man who commanded the crew that dropped the first atomic bomb,  which ultimately brought World War II to a close.  Tibbets lived for many  years in the same small Ohio town as Greene's family, but like so many  other GIs, he was unknown to all but a few of his own generation.  In  meeting Tibbets and recording his thoughts and observations, Greene learned  a great deal more about his own father and the World War II generation in  general.  This and more, he shares with us in poignant detail.<br />Not lost  in all of this is the story of a man, his life's work complete, taking his  leave of this earth slowly.  Greene records many moments--both sad &amp;  touching at the same time--of his father's final weeks.  To those of us who  have already lived this chapter of life with our own family members, or may  be facing it all too soon, it is a common-sense road map of just how one  family managed to respond.  <br />You can almost see the elder Mr. Greene  smiling down his approval on all that has been said in this book.	2000-07-20

CHRISTMAS 101, a parallel volume to last year's THANSKGIVING 101, covers all aspects of the holidays, in addition to actual food preparation.  There  are many tips on how to get all of it--cleaning, decorating, card-writing,  grocery shopping, cookie baking, pre-holiday entertaining, the Big Days  themselves--all done, while remaining a sane inhabitant of this  planet.<br />This is a book dedicated to good food and good times.  Rogers  recalls many nostalgic moments from his own lifetime of holidays which will  likely evoke the same feelings in most readers.  He provides authentic  recipes from the past, and also addresses present-day concerns.  Offerings  include:  classic egg nog, as well as a no-raw-egg version; traditional  Jell-O salad, plus a more contemporary Roasted Beet &amp; Apple Salad;   some popular turkey and ham entrees, plus a fantastic tri-color lasagna.   The baking recipes--particularly those involving cookies--are thorough,  detailed, and guaranteed to produce spectacular results (and &quot;Cinnamon  Stars&quot; is one of the very best I have come across in a long time).   Above all, the recipes emphasize do-ahead steps, and rely on readily  available ingredients, so that you won't find yourself in the grocery store  at 11:30 p.m. on the biggest New Year's Eve of our lifetimes, in search of  some exotic item for an hors d'oeuvre recipe.<br />Rogers is no Martha  Stewart, with hot glue gun in hand.  Although he provides many successful  strategies for decorating, they are straight-forward and easily  accomplished.  Just as in his last book, he examines the history of certain  customs (Christmas punch, holiday cookies, champagne &amp; caviar), and  gives some insight into some of today's most popular traditions.  His  recommendations for Christmas CDs and classic must-see holiday videos are  right on target.<br />It's only October, so take a deep breath, do some  reading now, and then sit back to thoroughly enjoy the final holiday season  of the 1900s!	1999-10-26

Yes, some of the recipes do call for specialized ingredients (Parmigiano Reggiano cheese instead of Kraft Parmesan, for example), but that's just  one detail that makes McNair's recipes so much better than many others.  I  recently made pizza for lunch for some houseguests who were astounded that  I could do so from scratch without an awful lot of effort--they had NEVER  seen it done at home before.  It's not at all difficult, and the results  are far superior to anything out of the freezer or thrown at the doorstep  by a fast-moving delivery driver.  Many of McNair's books are old reliables  around my house!	1999-07-24

I've had my copy of this book for almost 10 years, and I never get tired of the variety that it contains.  Face it, we've all become more dependent upon lean protein like chicken, but for many of us, that can get pretty  darn boring night after night.  McNair has responded to this problem with a  broad range of recipes that are guaranteed to please all tastes.  (I've  never run across the typo mentioned by a previous reviewer, but anyone who  cooks on a regular basis should be able to spot such a misprint  immediately, if it exists.)  McNair's recipes have been able to withstand  the test of time in my house, and I'm happily anticipating his next  volume--FAVORITES!	1999-07-23

I'm not quite there myself, but having been a Bob Greene fan since 1976's JOHNNY DEADLINE, REPORTER, I felt that I had to buy and read this one in advance of my milestone birthday.  As usual, Greene is right on target with  his observations.<br />Introspection is something that many of us avoid, but  Greene is right there nudging us to take a look at our innermost feelings  and reactions to a variety of different situations.  At 47, I've already  experienced a good many of them, and I'm grateful to find out in advance  about those that may be forthcoming.  As usual, Greene's writing style is  like a welcome long-distance call from your oldest and best friend--you  hang on every word, you anticipate the outcome of a story, and you relish  each other's happiness in describing the events of everyday life.<br />Greene  is the heartbeat of us all.	1999-07-05

The authors review more than 500 popular cookbooks that are currently available, and provide their thoughts on the recipes contained in each of them.  Yes, their comments are generally positive, but then, that's implied  by the title of the book, GREAT BOOKS FOR COOKS.<br />The authors acknowledge  this clearly in the introduction by explaining some of their criteria  (e.g.: some cookbooks were automatically excluded if recipes were found to  be unreliable).  They also note that preferences are, indeed, subjective.   Personally, I am very comfortable trusting two successful cookbook authors  rather than someone else when it comes to a selection process such as this.   (Just for the record, there are only 7 cookbooks written by either of the  two authors that are included in the review of 500+ books.)<br />The book is  nicely organized into various categories--general, single-subject, ethnic,  baking, TV personalities, etc.  The authors mention some of the stand-out  recipes from each book, thus giving readers a good idea of whether or not  the book will be right for themselves or as a gift for someone else.  With  tens of thousands of cookbooks available at various mega-stores and  on-line, it's high time that people who are experienced cooks and authors  helped the rest of us make some sense of all the choices that are available  today.<br />It is also an enjoyable and a highly readable book, and a good  addition to all those issues of Bon Appetit, Gourmet, and Cooking Light  that we keep on the bedside table for inspiration.	1999-06-26

All the recipes work well either  stuffed into a turkey or a chicken (or even into an acorn squash), or baked  in a casserole.

Rodgers often recommends taking certain additional preparation steps, and that's what makes his  recipes SOOOOOOO much better than some of the awful things that a few of  the manufacturers have published.  I especially like Hot Fudge Spooncake,  and prepare it regularly--it's great to come home to the smell of of  freshly baked dessert!  For those recipes that require a precise cooking  time, I just use a $4 lamp and appliance timer that I picked up at my local  hardware store to turn the pot on while I'm at work--problem solved!

OK, so all of us have steered ourselves away from fried foods &amp; towards poached chicken breasts (skinless, of course) and steamed vegetables.  How about just a little taste of good eating from the past?   No one is recommending a return to deep-fried foods as an everyday meal,  but the taste treats in this book are just too good to ignore!<br />Rodgers'  chatty writing style and well-tested recipes combine to provide accurate  and easy-to-follow instructions.  Since working with a deep fryer is  something that many us have not done in years (if EVER!), he provides  detailed background info on the types of equipment available, different  varieties of oil &amp; shortenings, and many good tips to avoid excess  greasiness and off-tastes in cooked foods.  Appetizers, entrees, and  desserts are all covered, with great photos of completed items.<br />Some of  the recipes are incredibly simple, such as the Cornish game hens (hens,  oil, lemon, salt, pepper) and can be prepared in under 15 minutes.  Others  are a little more involved, but well worth it (the apple fritters, with  just a light dusting of powdered sugar, are fantastic).  There's even a  foolproof recipe for doughnuts with a cider glaze--great for weekend  mornings!<br />I have to say it again--I'm not going to be cooking deep fried  foods every day, but when I want to prepare something just a little bit  special, this is a book that I will turn to time after time.	1999-01-28

Steak Sandwiches with  Mushroom-Red Wine Sauce make a great Saturday lunch, Corn-Battered Morels  have served me well as an impressive appetizer, and several of the recipes  work nicely as either casual or company main dishes, several which are  meatless.<br />The author has given readers an excellent background in  mushrooms, along with appropriate words of warning to would-be gatherers.   Numerous mail-order sources are identified for those in need of items that  are not available locally.  The main thing to remember is that this book in notan encyclopedic JOY OF COOKING, nor was it meant to be.

I purchased this book about a year and a half ago when it became clear that my holiday brunches were getting just a little TOO predictable.  Family and friends knew what they'd be getting each time, and it was  becoming just a little boring.  Then Michael McLaughlin came to the rescue  with GOOD MORNINGS.<br />He covers a variety of meal styles, from rib-sticking  breakfast feasts to more elegant brunches, to some light &amp; quick  choices like Blueberry-Watermelon Smoothies.  There are some recipes that  appeal to adults (like the Warm Salad of Scrambled Eggs, Smoked Fish, and  Greens, which was excellent and relatively simple to make for 4); others  that are geared to younger tastes (such as PB &amp; J--Peanut Butter &amp;  Jelly--French Toast Sandwiches--great when made with grape jelly!); and  dishes with universal appeal like Creamed Hash Browns.<br />I now find myself  using the book more and more when I have weekend houseguests.  Since  people's individual tastes can vary so widely early in the morning, there  is definitely something for everyone in this collection.  Even with a  diverse group that included a dedicated dieter, another who wanted  &quot;just coffee&quot;, and others who were willing to indulge a bit, I've  been able to pull together a good meal in very little time.  (Many of the  recipes have make-ahead steps.)  In addition to the emphasis on relaxed  entertaining, there are many good suggestions, particularly among the  breads, rolls, and muffins (Carrot-Currant Bran Muffins are a particular  favorite of mine), that will fill the bill nicely on a weekday morning when  people are headed out to work or school.  Now that the holidays are here,  and I'm expecting visitors, I'm pulling this book out again so that I can  feed them well, and still have some time for myself.	1998-11-19

Rick Rodgers has many previous cookbooks to his credit, but this is his  best.  Whether you are a veteran at Thanksgiving dinner prepapration, a  first-timer, or somewhere in between, this volume will give you ideas,  strategies, and a couple of wonderful stories about how the author has  handled the meal over the years.<br />The recipes deal with formal service,  buffets, and even a possible solution for cooks who have to deal with  televised football that is in competition with the meal.  Whatever your  meal plans, there are ideas &amp; solutions here.<br />There are many  traditional dishes documented clearly for those of us who were not paying  attention at Grandma's or Mom's elbow, along with some more modern  variations on the Thanksgiving theme.  Above all, Rodgers knows and  understands the limitations of the average American kitchen, and just how  much space that we have available in our freezers, refrigerators, and  ovens.  The recipes acknowledge this nicely, and he often presents a  top-of-the-stove alternative to some dishes, rather than forcing us to jam  yet another casserole into an already overcrowded oven.<br />On the subject of  buffets (which more of us seem to be embracing nowadays), he gives some  practical suggestions so that the host/ess does not end up with half a  dozen veggie casseroles, but no salads.  Many of the recipes have steps  that can be prepared earlier in the week, and then put into play on the Big  Day.<br />Most of all, there is a nice tone to the book.  The author  acknowledges many of the traditional Thanksgiving dishes that we have all  known or experienced (Jell-O molds, Campbell's Green Bean Bake, canned  cranberry sauce), while gently presenting alternatives for those who would  like something just a little bit different this year.<br />It's only  mid-October, but I now have my family's Thanksgiving dinner planned right  down to the desserts!	1998-10-19

I received this book as a Christmas gift in 1996, and I go back to it again and again.  McClay was an insider in the I LOVE LUCY family, the son of Lucille Ball's long-time publicist.  The thoroughly written and illustrated volume was prepared in cooperation with Lucille Ball's family, and carries an introduction by her daughter Lucie Arnaz.  I thought that I had seen and read all there was about my favorite 1950s TV program, but this book contains many new photos, from both on and off the sets, including several original color photos of the family at home.  McClay's narrative contains many interesting anecdotes about the cast.  The summaries of every single plot are well-written, and accompanied by numerous photos.  See if your favorite episodes are contained in The Classic 35 Episodes (I'm glad that McClay did not limit it to something like 10 or 25--remember that there were 179 shows altogether!)  Also included is a summary of the 13 hour-long Lucy-Desi Comedy Hours ! programs.  A must-have for any Lucy fan!	1998-07-26

Some of the recipes are a bit more time-consuming than you will want to attempt for an after-work meal, but they are just the thing for socializing around the kitchen during the weekends.  The book is nicely divided by seasons, so for example, if you're looking for a great Saturday night dinner in Summer, there are many recipe suggestions suited to the very best foods of the season.  The Sunday breakfast/brunch ideas are all excellent.  One of my year-round favorite dinners: Pork Chops with Bourbon-Maple Pan Gravy--a dish that receives rave reviews every time that I serve it!  McLaughlin provides clear and thorough directions, and has an entertaining writing style throughout.  This book is a must-have for anyone who ever entertains stay-over houseguests!	1998-07-25
US	52599910	R2ECTJ8ONX4KBT	0671785397	456845569	Fifty-Two Meat Loaves	Books	5	9	9	N	N	One of my favorites in a collection of almost 200 cookbooks.	If you think that all meat loaves are the same--just hamburger and assorted bread crumbs--prepare to be surprised!  The recipes in this collection provide tremendous variety for an old stand-by.  The section entitled &quot;Alternative Loaf Styles&quot; offers a good many recipes for those of us who are trying to eat just a bit lighter and healthier these days.  (One of my favorites is Shrimp &amp; Chicken Loaf with Pink Tomato Cream--excellent!)  Each of the recipes is paired with an appropriate side dish, along with other ideas to round out a meal.  In addition, there are great leftover suggestions following each entry.  The book is nicely illustrated with some nostalgic artwork and photos that will evoke your own memories of good eating back in the 1950s.  This book is McLaughlin at his very best, with his warm writing style and personal anecdotes coming through on every page.  It's one of the most splattered &amp; regularly used books in my kitchen.	1998-07-18

I purchased the original edition in 1987, and find that it continues to be enjoyable reading even today.  There is a tremendous sense of history, as well as beautiful photography throughout this volume.	1998-07-13

The writing style, however, lacks the usual warmth that is characteristic of her co-author, Michael  McLaughlin.  I bought the book because of McLaughlin's name on the title page, and while I think it is generally OK, I definitely miss his usual imprint.	1998-07-13

The recipes cover all categories, including appetizers and desserts, are easy to read, and highly reliable.  There are many innovative suggestions that have been well received by my family and friends.  As usual, McLaughlin's folksy writing style makes for a highly enjoyable read.	1998-07-08
