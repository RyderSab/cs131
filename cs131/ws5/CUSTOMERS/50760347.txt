This book is a collection of essays remarking on everyday annoyances, the wife and kids, frustrations in stores and at parties, etc.  The kind of thing old Andy Rooney has been droning on about for years.  The book seems to be aimed at a young audience who  a)loves Mystery Science Theater (as who doesn't?), b) has no idea who Andy Rooney is, c) laughs at the obvious.  The humor is sometimes strained, pointless, and obvious.  As with Mr. Rooney, there ARE some funny things sparsely sprinkled about.  Hey, I'm a rabid Mystie, I like Mike and am glad he's found a new career. I just don't think Mind Over Matters is very entertaining.	2002-12-17

The 300 films he mentioned are scattered throughout in italics.  Mr. Medavoy writes extensively of the process of producing movies. He makes sures we know he is responsible for the success of many motion pictures. He also admits no one knows why one film which shows every indication of becoming a smash will fail, while another will come out of nowhere and become a hit. OK, but there is no gossip.  There are no entertaining anecdotes. There is nothing interesting, in fact nothing to interest the average reader who is interested in Hollywood.  I said the average reader. These pages and pages of numbers and formulas and musings about box-office openings are no doubt fascinating to accountants and marketing people.  I picture them swooning over this book.  If books could be compared on a scale with movies, one might say &quot;You're Only As Good..&quot; is the  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of number crunchers.	2002-12-14

Sorry, I've been a slavish fan of Dennis Miller for years and years and years, but this latest book of rants has a thread of really disturbing ugliness running through it.  Mean spirited, angry, foul-mouthed ugliness, like a faint but persistent bad smell.  Yes, yes, the much-vaunted free flowing wit is there, but I just found the reading disturbing.  Dennis has been spending too much time in the bowels of the locker room with his new NFL friends.  They, and men in general, will howl with laughter.

I just love this little book, I find I have checked it out of the library so many times that I am definitely going to buy it.  I have always been interested in the lives of saints.  Let's face it, they lived so long ago, in times unimaginable to us, and there are so many strange stories attached to their lives. Some stories in here are so bizarre that they're funny, but I guess this is where Faith comes in.  This book lists the saintly people from A to Z and is full of odd anecdotes, fascinating old illustrations, and tells you which saints are associated with what  (St. Clare - patron saint of television? Who knew?)  I think some of the associations should be updated, how many barrel makers and brewers are around nowadays?  Very interesting, very humorous, very informative. (This from a cheerfully lapsed Catholic.)  Not a Definitive Version of Lives of the Saints, I'm sure, but good reading.	2001-08-12

Subjects include a trip to Iceland, a wildnerness survival/tracking course, a visit to a New Age mecca, and climbing a mountain somewhere in New England.  Mr. Rakoff isn't as funny as David Sedaris, there is a strong undertone of melancholy, and he is self-deprecating in the extreme.

I plan to look up his previous work on the internet, and look forward to any future books with great anticipation.	2001-08-01

This is a book from the 70's I have read many times. There was a miniseries made from it starring Bette Davis in her later years, playing a New England &quot;wise woman&quot;. It's about a family moving from the big city to a quaint old-fashioned New England village. Hilarity does not ensue. A growing sense of horror and suspense does. How many times have we read that story, huh?  Well, this one is different in that it is so well written and the end is so shocking.  All of Tom Tryon's books are wonderful, and I know this one is also out of print, sadly enough. Come on, you people know you've seen it at garage sales, at used book stores, on the table at the library's annual book sale.  Should you ever come across &quot;Harvest Home&quot;, pick it up.

I read Ms. Karbo's other books and enjoyed them, and though not divorced, started reading this one.  Initially I thought it really was awfully Erma Bombeck-like - you know, cutesy, breezy, stating the obvious cliches to invoke a laugh of recognition. Lots of divorce statistics, lots of divorce stories, an interesting chapter on Henry VIII, and Ms. Karbo's own interesting messy life with A New Man. I thought this book was aiming for a &quot;how to live happily ever after&quot; with stepkids, but was surprised and intrigued by how the New Man's ex-wife intruded on their lives .  This ex-wife was a truly awful, disturbed, intrusive failure with a severe personality disorder who just would not let go of her ex husband.  She called him with every excuse possible several times an hour.  She could not hold a job. She could not handle money.  And the ex husband put up with this for one reason - the child they had together.  The poor child in the custody of this loon, used as a hostage and negotiating chip.  Poor Ms. Karbo, watching the New Man take it and take it and take it.  Poor New Man, wanting only to live his life with his new honey but forced to put up with  neverending harassment for the sake of his daughter. Not physical abuse, mind you, just mental and verbal, but there was always that underlying threat of bodily harm to somebody. I was wrung out!  Quite an interesting book!`  The moral of the story, which cannot be repeated too many times:  BEWARE of entering a relationship with a divorced parent, if the other parent is anywhere in the picture.	2001-05-07

OK, the word is CUTE! There, I said it. Well, actually it is, mostly. Set in a pretty, prosperous city, the fairly well-off characters deal with marriage, pregnancy, and childbirth. (No raw, rude, crude slice of life here.) It concerns Brooke, a tired young mother married to a man who plays a computer game called &quot;Realm of the Elf&quot;, 24/7, and shows little interest in his family. This isn't good, of course, but Brooke admits they sort of rushed into marriage and pregnancy. Brooke's best friend, Mary Rose, is knocked up by Brooke's shirt-tail cousin, who is still technically married.  This book is quite witty,often funny, and the characters seem like people I would love, yes, love to know. And there is a surprise near the ending. There is much about pregnancy ,which some people may find informative, but some people may also find the joy 'n wonder Brooke finds in her child's every gurgle a mite tedious.  Be patient, this book is worth it as a pick-me-up any day! It's the type of book you could lend to an elderly aunt and she would tsk-tsk-these-young-people-nowadays, but she would also say with perfect truth that she loved it, nonetheless. I'm giving it 4 stars because there is a lot of yadayadayada about basketball which I don't understand or care much about, but that's my own personal shortcoming.  Enjoy!	2001-04-28

One of them is an actor, the other is a dancer. The dancer dies and leaves behind his beloved cat and also a girlfriend, Emilia. Emilia comes to visit the actor and the cat. They come to believe the dancer's spirit is in the cat, which speaks to them. And dances, hence the &quot;Dance for Emilia&quot;.  It's a cute story, but it lacks drama, or the real magic which Peter S. Beagle is known for. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought it was just OK.  And I'm sorry, I know I'm buying into stereotypes, but the two friends, the actor and dancer, struck me as being gay.  The girlfriend didn't ring true.  Mr. Beagle should have gone ahead and portrayed the friends in their true light, but perhaps if they were gay the book wouldn't sell as well. And of course it would have been a whole different book! (No cute little &quot;adventures&quot; between the dancer and Emilia. In fact, no Emilia.  Emil, maybe?) The cover is beautiful, and it looks like a nice gift book to give someone who is grieving.	2001-03-13

This was one great read, I am definitely going to check out Mr. Pearson's other books!  &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; is really two stories alternating. One involves a new deputy sheriff investigating a death with the help of a high-string (female) park ranger near the Appalachin Trail in Virginia. (Right here the book had me, because these circumstances echoed the works of Bill Bryson and the transcendent Sharyn McCrumb.)  The other story concerns a man who is summoned to New York City to identify what is supposed to be the body of his murdered son, whom he had never met. This man is visited by some very bad, yet elegant and polite, people who the dead son was involved with. The man is taken on a sort of tour of the city, much against his will, and there is some real suspense as to what the outcome of this trip will be.  Mr. Pearson writes in such a whimsical and lyrical way, you can just hear the people speaking.  I love his description of the deputy's aunt, a terrible cook, who expects him for dinner every week.  Of the two stories, the New York story is more involving . The deputy's story is flavorful but not so involving, becoming more of a feisty romance.  I highly recommend this wonderful novel, you will find yourself re-reading descriptive sentences over and over for the sheer pleasure of reading!	2001-03-13

Consider &quot;Where Love Goes&quot;, one of my very favorite books. Similar to the television program &quot;Once and Again&quot;, it involved two divorced people who each have kids, who fall madly madly madly in love, and attempt to blend their awkward, hostile families.  The parents are on cloud nine, the kids loathe each other - non-hilarity results!  The relationships are mercilessly examined in minute detail, with often toe-curling reactions in the reader.  Anyone who has kids, who has fallen in love with someone with their own kids, ought to read this book to get a clue as to what the not-in-love kids feel about the whole thing.  It will make you think twice about remarriage.  The writing, of course, is what makes this book so good, you grow to feel deeply for all of the characters just as if they were real people you knew.  Or at least people on TV!  There's much to be said for waiting until the kids are out on their own before giving into one's private bliss.  A very, very good book, I'm re-reading it for the third time.	2001-03-13

I looked through this book, curious to see if there were any Mexican recipes to try beyond the ever-present Taco Bell variety (not that there's anything wrong with that).  This is a very good looking book, the recipes are detailed and sound delicious, however, without actually making anything, I have a feeling these recipes are not appropriate for the beginning cook. You would need many &quot;exotic&quot; ingredients not commonly found in many areas of the country; the recipes are very labor intensive; one would need a very good kitchen fan to deal with all that roasting of peppers; you are sternly advised that no substitutes are allowed.  Fair enough, this is authentic Mexican cuisine. Maybe when the weather warms up I will track down all those peppers, etc., buy a pair of rubber gloves, and open up the windows and make something...authentic.	2001-02-05

I enjoyed many things about this Sunny Randall book, and some things just drove me nuts.<br />Good:  familiar territory, &quot;Spenser-in-a-dress&quot;, quick and easy to read (I attacked each small chapter while quite ill, and the book went by quite painlessly).<br />Bad: not much of a story, frankly. Characters &quot;sketchy&quot;, unengaging. Mr. Parker can't seem to get over the fact that a woman can be a detective and seems overly fond of having her called a &quot;girl&quot;, over and over. (&quot;No Gurlz Allowed&quot;?) Also still dragging in that feminist stuff left over from the late 60's.<br />Neutral: a lot - A LOT - of long, loving descriptions of the antics of the cute widdle doggy.  You have to like dogs in Mr. Parker's books.  I thought the dog was cute, but it got wearing after a while, reading the 90th description of the dog's drinking water or sleeping cutely on the bed.<br />And what's the deal with the ex-husband? I'm still not sure what the problem is, something about &quot;not needing to be together to be complete&quot; - more dated feminist hooey!  Again, the ex is there to be a safety net for the Meg Ryan/Helen Hunt heroine who might get in over her pretty little head.<br />I enjoy Mr. Parker's writing, but thought this particular sample was unengaging and kind of dated.  It was kind of like eating a carton of generic ice cream on a hot day, it tastes OK and goes down easy; but later on, you wonder why on earth you bothered to eat it!	2000-11-09

Married,  nice part-time job, friends and family, lives in a beautiful part of the  country, cute little boy, saucy empowering best friend.  Look closer:  marriage going downhill fast, job about to be eliminated, and her  parents!!! Hag-ridden by a truly monstrous, alcoholic, sharp-as-a-razor  mother - but the mother is dying, and the mother is deeply loved. She has  her faults, but she is your mother.  Remote, sarcastic, alcoholic father -  but the father is also deeply loved. Who doesn't want the love and approval  of Daddy?  Born-again, weak, bible thumping  brother - but you can't hate  him, he came from the same place you did!  Uncommunicative, secretive  husband, downing health potions, distancing himself more every day - well,  some things you may be unable to fix. Sounds awful, but Ms. Giles makes all  of this both hilarious and tragic. You will laugh and you will cry.  There  are tons of stories about women and their midlife crises out there  (including the paragon, &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot;), and as the  midlife crisis is a perennial subject, many of the stories have a sameness  to them.  Worries about growing older, about a failing marriage, thoughts  of having an affair to affirm that you are still attractive and desirable,  and the looming realization that parents are not going to be here all that  much longer. The looming realization that you can, yes, you can grow  stronger and take charge of your own life and for once make yourself happy.  Facing the death and decline of your parents, no matter how lousy they were  - they are dear to you and no matter how old you are, you want their love  and approval as much as when you were six years old.  Ms. Giles takes all  of these elements of the same old story and writes beautifully, making it a  joy to read.  You have to shake your head at our frazzled heroine, tell her  to grow up, to get a grip, at the same time you want to hug her.  Hey, it's  easy to sneer at this middle aged child-woman, but she spent her whole life  with two monsters and she can't just change overnight. But there are  definite signs of hope at the end of this book, and you cheer for her. As  in many stories of this type, the setting is in an upper middle class town:  money is no problem, at least for the parents, which may make the heroine's  life easier. She doesn't have to worry about Medicare or Meals on Wheels or  home aides - the dying mother is draped in mink and diamonds and there is a  loyal, hard working housekeeper pitching in.  But death and dying is never  easy, especially when there's so much you want to hear, or say, and time is  running out.  I just loved this book, it is very well done of its type, it  has dark humor , bitterness, despair, anguish, wit, and hope. I finished  Iron Shoes this morning and put it aside genuinely sorry to see it end.Hey, it's  easy to sneer at this middle aged child-woman, but she spent her whole life  with two monsters and she can't just change overnight.

Story of an  upper class woman with two snotty daughters, a weary loyal maid, and an  insufferable social climbing lawyer husband, all living in Manhattan.  The  woman begins an affair with a possibly dangerous man, a famous author.  The  middle aged crazy emotions our heroine rollercoasts through are familiar  stuff, but so well written. And the details of their lives, the wonderful  descriptions of apartments and dinners and fashions, of a New York City  that is sadly no more (late '60's, when it was affordable for people other  than Donald Trump to live there) - just one of the best novels I've ever  read. Funny/sad, often maddening, you might look at a real life example of  this well-dressed, well -off woman and wonder (as someone states in the  movie version, at a group therapy meeting at the end) - just what does this  woman have to be unhappy about?  You read about this woman's life, the  material things, the parties, the life in the middle of the greatest city  on earth, and you wonder why she is unhappy, just what the hell does she  WANT? Well, she's not sure, but something isn't right in her life. The  affair is bad, wrong, and inevitable and as necessary as air to breathe. So  just what do women want?  I'm not really sure. But here's an insight -  &quot;money does not buy happiness&quot;.  If you ever run across this  book, I recommend it highly, it was one of my favorites years ago and time  has not diminished it at all.	2000-09-19

I had never heard of Mark Bittman but apparently read about him somewhere  so got this book from the library, and I absolutly LOVE this cookbook!  It  is not a homey, comfort-food deal, with recipes needing 20 ingredients.  There are no cute illustrations or large glossy food-porn photos of the  finished product. These are sophisticated recipes calling for a few good  ingredients.  They can be changed around quite a bit according to  suggestions at the end of the recipe. Now, don't think the ingredients  called for are hard to find and/or exotic.  If you live out in the boonies,  maybe you'll have a problem finding lemongrass or cilantro, but I live in a  dying mid-size northeastern city and every supermarket bigger than a 7-11  has everything you can imagine. The zucchini pancakes with Asian flavorings  are easy to make and just out of this world, and you can use other  vegetables also.  Never in my life did I think I would eat cilantro, much  less make pilgramages to the farmers market to actually buy it!  This  cookbook contains recipes for good stuff not too hard to make, but be aware  there is no Old-Fashioned meatloaf, no Susie's apple pie, or Grandma's  marshmallow fudge. If you've moved beyond that cuisine, this is the book  for you.	2000-09-06

I felt after a while that I was reading a book by someone trying to  imitate her unique style.  All the elements of an Alice Hoffman novel are  in here, but for some reason this book did not work its usual magic for me.  I found it downright tedious at times, and more dark, depressing, and cruel  than called for.  I just could not warm up to any of the characters (and we  have met these characters in Ms. Hoffman's other novels, many times! They  have other names and lives, of course, but they are familiar to the steady  reader.) Of course, as the old cliche goes, anything by Alice Hoffman is  better than nothing. &quot;River King&quot; just seems a little  &quot;off&quot; to me, much as I love her other work.  There are familiar  things, the delightful &quot;magical realism&quot;; the lovely descriptions  of weather and birds and bees  and fauna and flowers; the angst of passion  and romance and secret hurts behind peoples' facades.  But there's  something missing. I could not get involved in this story, Betsy did not  make me feel much of anything, except impatience. The fiance came across as  a total zero. The school seemed understaffed and poorly run; in fact as a  &quot;character&quot;, the school was awfully sketchy, it seemed like just  a plot device to get all these people in one place and not like a real  school at all. Never having attended a &quot;fancy boarding school&quot;,I  wonder what kind of place allows students to go tramping through the woods  all night! And that poor boy, troubled and wasting away, skipping his  classes every day - did no one in that school in any position of authority  have the slightest inclination to help him at all? No health care  professional, no psychologist did anything? Only one equally pathetic girl  friend ? I thought the girl's story was pretty interesting, I like reading  about the poor and disadvantaged struggling for success in life.  I think  there were too many characters, interesting as some of the minor ones were.  All those stories clamoring to be told, everyone trying to fit themselves  into the big picture.

Of course this would be beyond boring .(The following is NOT in  the book, but I imagine a highway-driving book would read something like:  &quot;going 80 MPH on dry road, adjusted air vents, changed radio station 5  times, yawned non-stop till lunch, saw 3 white tractortrailers, 4 gray  tractortrailers....&quot;) Mr. McMurtry does not inflict a diary of his  driving habits upon us, but he does throw in quite a bit of interesting  American history regarding the states he rips through, especially regarding  past battles with American Indians. Though he does not get out and mingle  with the public at rest stops or museums or anywhere else, he does make  note of all those museums he blasts past, and makes observations on the  weather, the amount of sky proportional to land/water, the amount of litter  state-by-state, and of course the never-ending ebb and flow of highway  traffic.  He also writes about authors and books he admires, and provides  anecdotes about his own life and part-time job of book collecting.  This is  an interesting book, confined mainly to the west and south of the country,  the east being too cold and gray for Mr. McMurtry.  It is well written  (well, duh!) but short, and not very in-depth.  &quot;Blue Highways&quot;  by William Least Heat Moon is a better example of the  travel-through-American genre which Mr. M points out at the start.	2000-08-31

Tell me, in any other series, is there any sidekick so  colorful and over-the-top as Clete?  In this story, our man Clete has an  affair of the heart with wrenching results.  Once again, bodies of (mostly)  bad guys are strewn across the landscape, meeting their violent fates in  gruesome detail.  Once again, there are despicable, corrupt rich people to  plot and connive.  Once again, Bootsie the Amazing Blow-Up Doll serves our  man Dave lunch and provides him succor and comfort (although she does show  signs of human life when she gets ticked off by the non-stop violence,  though she should be used to it by now.).Mr. Burke describes the sights,  sounds,  and smells. and flora and fauna, and the extreme weather, of the  Louisiana bayou, and the details of the lives of rich and poor people who  live there. There have been many reviews concerning the plot of this book,  so I won't go into that again, but I do want to point out a few things that  made this one special to me:  I found the relationship between the young  hit man, Dave, and his daughter to be absolutely fascinating.  There is a  twist in the tale of Clete's new lady friend and her sister, who is on  death row, that is devastating.  And the story of Dave's search for the  murderers of his mother, and the final justice...These things I found to be  extremely touching.  I felt sorry for the hit man, the twin sisters, and of  course for Dave.  The ending of this book brought tears to my eyes.  A  wonderful, violent, touching, engrossing, purple-prose story from one of my  favorite authors ever, thank you, James Lee Burke!	2000-08-28

I didn't find this book funny, though there was some (very) dark humor in it and a few really hilarious laugh-out-loud  passages. I don't understand why people like to laugh at those pathetic  souls throwing their lives and talents away. That said, I must admit I  couldn't put this book down.  The high points for me were the advice on  what kind of kitchen equipment is useful to have; the advice on what to  look for, what not to order in a restaurant; the interesting descriptions  of restaurants and the owners.  The low points: well, Mr. Bourdain comes  across as a real low-life; he sneers at the common, Great Unwashed, tacky  hordes of tourists and weekend diners cluttering up restaurants he toils  in. Hey, Bub, we're paying your salary!(This is akin to a piano, if it  could talk, protesting anyone except Mozart pounding on its keyboard!)  There are long, loving descriptions of the many geeks and freaks he has  befriended and worked with, and just as many long, loving descriptions of  the many drug benders,toots,runs and all-nighters they indulged themselves  in, though how they managed to go to work every day is beyond me. (Note to  self: if served another bad restaurant meal, storm the kitchen, determine  if chef is conscious.)  There is a shadowy wife mentioned but what part she  played in all this is ignored completely. (Not that I was exactly  interested in, say,  what the color scheme was for their wedding; but  didn't his wife notice their Christmas tree was still up in August, and why  couldn't she dispose of it?)  I grew weary and disgusted with Mr.  Bourdain's non-stop doping and drifting, but I loved reading about food and  restaurants and kitchen knives.  One thing stood out, a chef's job is  difficult and dangerous, and the hours are long.  I recommend this book,  but mostly as a hair raising autobiography. Please read &quot;The Making of  a Chef&quot; by Michael Ruhlman for a more &quot;palatable&quot; and  in-depth book about chef-ery and the love of food.chef-ery and the love of food.	2000-08-12

The author hitchhikes (mostly)  across the U.S.A. after doing same some 20 years ago in his hippie days. He  has some anxiety but finds his fears overblown. (Truthfully, this kind of  book really, really, really makes one want to chuck everything, the house,  the mate, the kids, the job, and just hit the open road.  I mean this.) He  meets kind and interesting people, too.  I would compare this book to the  writings of Bill Bryson, though without Bryson's humor. I only wish the  book was longer!	2000-08-04

Some stories are more like character sketches. The people are either middle aged, or are the children of same, and they are all rich, but  the reader's nose is never rubbed in this fact. They are the &quot;old,  discreet rich&quot; rather than the brash, gaudy &quot;new rich&quot;.  These stories are well written but on the bland side, not what  you'd call  passionate or engrossing, but gentle and introspective.  Romantic dilemmas  and stepchildren figure highly in these stories.  I prefer the stepchildren  stories which point out that although the children suffer in a divorce,  their parents aren't exactly having a day at the beach, either.  I really  enjoyed this book and will seek out Ms. Robinson's other book of stories,  &quot;A Glimpse of Scarlet&quot;, which sounds from th e description as if  it wlll be equally enjoyable.	2000-06-08

But this book is a one-shot deal.  Robert Crais has obviously done a LOT of research in this story, we learn probably more than we want to know about bombs and  explosives.  That Mad Bomber we've seen, on  television and in endless  cartoons, is real and not in the slightest cute or funny.  The poor heroine  is a tough cookie on the outside, living a life here on Earth one step  removed from hell, and I could not for the life of me understand how she  functioned on the cigarette/gin/Altoid/Tagamet diet. There was absolutely  no backstory on her, no friends or family or anything.  I pitied her but  could not really like or understand her.  So, I guess I was disappointed in  this book. But Robert Crais is such an excellent writer that I will give it  four stars, though that's stretching it.  Hope we get an Elvis Cole novel  this year, every single one of the Elvis Cole novels get five stars from  me!

The author, a woman, writes from the point of view of a young man so brilliantly, so honestly, you would never ever guess it was written by a woman, she did a truly exceptional job  getting into Harley's mind.  The story is devastating, this poor boy from  an abusive dysfunctional home is trying to shoulder the burden of caring  for his three sisters, to be the man his disgusting dead father never was.  He works two jobs in a nowhere town, gets nothing but grief from his  sisters, is riddled with grief and bitterness and hormones.  Their house is  falling apart, they are eating garbage-y junk food, and there is very  little help for any of them.  I could sense tragedy, if not a massive  nervous breakdown, coming from the very start.  This is not a pleasant  book. We sit and laugh at the Jerry Springer people on TV but this is the  sort of hopeless, ignorant, mind-numbing background they come from, and  more people should be aware of it. Because violence, ignorance, and poverty  do not produce nice polite happy people.  Tawni Wells, major  congratulations to you for capturing Harley's voice and world so pefectly.  You made me cry, and I can only hope this pathetic family (what's left of  it) will survive and someday be in a happier place.	2000-05-18

This book has many chapters with profiles of your typical male loser and checklists you can use to determine the exact degree of loserdom. Also in each chapter is a typical conversation between some questing woman and the  man she meets who goes on to display all the characteristics found in the  checklist.  What annoys me is the cloying, cutesey tone of these  conversations with most lame, trite stabs at &quot;wit&quot; I have ever  painfully read.  A rising sense of panic began to overcome me as  realization dawned that the world is so jam-packed with Loser Men that  there is virtually no hope for a normal woman to hook a normal man.  Luckily, I believe there is a lid for every pot and women will continue to  choose men in their lives that they need for psychological reasons of their  own, and they will put up with their choices.  For those women who are  undecided about the men they date, this book will at least clearly point  out the bad habits of various guys so they will at least be warned before  getting in too deep.  Say what you like about Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but I  truly feel her two books, The Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their  Lives and The Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives, are more  useful to both sexes.	2000-05-18

It is very well researched and illustrated and discusses clothes and fashions from long ago up till today. And not just fashions and how they change, but what they MEAN.  For example, did you know....in olden  times, not just elegant clothing, but cloth itself was and admired and  expensive commodity. The more cloth making up one's clothing meant that  person was wealthy. Paintings of the period featured draperies in the  background to indicate a person's wealth, and even today designer clothing  uses more cloth and is cut fuller, carrying on the tradition.  Anyone  interested in not only fashion and clothing but symbols and history should  read this book, it is just fascinating and delicious.	2000-04-28

I enjoyed the beautiful photography in this book, even though the hand-writing around the little sketches was very hard to read. And I admired the author's keen eye for treasures and the hard work she put into refinishing pieces of furniture. I drooled over the stunning photos of the  curtains and hand made lace and linens, the old heavy linen sheets she  tracks down, the wonderful coordinating faded chintz ruffled pillows.  I  just have a couple of questions. 1) Where exactly does one go to find this  stuff if you don't live in a major city?  Our flea market has X-rated  exercise videos and beanie babies and old magazines, but is very short on  quaint furniture and heavy old linen sheets and handmade lace.  2) Should  one manage to lug home quaint old wooden furniture, fix it up, and cover it  with all the quaint old antique knicknacks (obtained for JUST PENNIES, of  course) - where in the house does one put all this stuff?  I reiterate,  this is a beautiful book to look at, and dream about, and it could serve as  inspiration.  But I think it's kind of impractical if you don't live near  an enormous flea market.  The &quot;pickers&quot; snatch up all the good  stuff before the general public  ever sees it, and what is left is so  ridiculously expensive it's not worth it.	2000-04-19

I enjoyed this book immensely. Ms. Shepard doesn't seem to hold much back, there are a lot of juicy anecdotes and what appears to be an honest portrayal of her many affairs with the famous and not-so-famous.  I  particularly enjoyed the detailed, behind-the-scenes, backbiting politics  of making a movie or television show, things the public is never aware of  that go on, the rivalries and intrigues and loyalty and disloyalty.  It's  too bad Ms. Shepard never quite seemed to understand why she did the things  she did, or why she stirred up such animosity and jealousy. There's a faint  undertone, always, of &quot;what did I do&quot; and &quot;why are they so  mean to me&quot;.  She doesn't seem to be a stupid woman, but she doesn't  seem to have a lot of insight.  I do think great beauty brings its own  problems, and she certainly was, and is, very beautiful.  I also admire  that Ms. Shepard was, and is, a fighter, she stands up for what she  believes in, whether it involves abortion rights or her television shows.  Not once did I detect any of the weepy, whiny, self-destructive ,  boozing,I've-been-abused-by-dozens-of-men  and here's-my-sad-story that you  might find in a weak  woman's autobiography (i.e. Marilyn Monroe, Bette  Davis)..She has shown herself to be smug, vain, and beset by enemies all  around, but she is no doormat and has the courage of her convictions.  She  is also beautiful, and let's remember she did appear in three of the Great  American Movies, even if she was someone's girlfriend, and two popular and  long-running television shows.  I wish her more luck in the future! She  seems honest, outspoken, and opinionated, and I hope as she ages gracefully  and the burden of her looks is not so heavy, she will go on to other  successes.	2000-04-14

I found this book to be nothing more than a laundry list of famous names that appeared on the Mike Douglas show over the past century, and very little else.  I was hardly expecting juicy gossip or lurid exposes, but at the very least some interesting anecdotes, and these were few and far  between.  I think Mr. D tried to cram too much into the book, and as a  result didn't have much to say about anyone. (To be fair, he indicates he  only knew most of them during the time they spent on his show.)  Also, you  will all be pleased to hear several times that Mr. Douglas has had just a  swell, super-happy life, and is also married to the most fantastic woman in  the entire universe.  So there you go, if you're of a certain age, and you  thrill to just the reading a list of the Big Names of yesteryear, and are  as happy as Mike Douglas, then you will enjoy this book.

Remember,  this was set 20 or more years ago, in a small backwards town where these  family secrets and abuse were tolerated and not spoken of.

A friend who glanced at this book sniffed, &quot;I don't know how you can read those English who-killed-the-vicar-in-the-library things, I don't have the patience&quot;, and I had to laugh because this is just about as  opposite a novel as you can get.  This book has three themes, the  disappearance of two young women; an elderly pedophile released from  prison; and a severely abused housewife.  Ms. Rendell writes so well,  detailing the hellish life of the housewife in stomach-roiling detail. She  also includes some of her deliciously psychotic character studies, and of  course all this is seen through the eyes of dear familiar Insp. Wexford.  There is a trace of humor in this book involving the inhabitants of a  lowish class housing development picketing the old reprobate's apartment,  singing &quot;Stand By Your Kids&quot; to the tune of &quot;Stand By Your  Man&quot;, and similar silliness that would make Jerry Springer feel right  at home! Sally Jesse, Maury Povich, and Jenny Jones would fit right into  this modern day England, and not a vicar in sight!  I am only giving it 4  stars because the stories do not tie together and they meander somewhat,  this is not Ms. Rendell's usual top=notch work. Also, Ms. Rendell and Insp.  Wexford are both getting up there in years, and I hope she goes on writing  forever, but there are hints the refined and compassionate policeman may be  getting weary of the crazy modern day world that is not only lived in  England, but all over.  I hope Ms. Rendell has many, many more novels in  her yet and we will see her policeman back on top of the game.  When she is  great, words cannot express the deep emotional impact her novels have on my  psyche. When she is merely good, as in &quot;Harm Done&quot;, she is still  sublime.  Rather than 4 stars, let me give this a &quot;9&quot; on a one to  ten scale. I look forward to her next books, both Wexford and non-Wexford.	2000-01-04

She lived a lifestyle I had vaguely read about, like the Maoris or Amazon Indians or Eskimos, and all I can think of is, how did she do it 20 or 30 years ago? Life among the  &quot;intelligensia&quot;, heavy drinking and wifeswapping and cooking the  entire gourmet Julia Child repetoire, copper pots and truffles and  pate...parties, parties, parties, from 4 to 75. Elaborate French dishes  painstakingly prepared from scratch. She even sewed her own dinner gowns,  for crying out loud! Trips to France on ocean liners, eating their way  through France...studying, writing, intellectual discussion of Shakespeare,  adulterous canoodling with a neighbor.  I thought the husband was a  professor but he must have made a mint - where did she get all the money  for all the wine, the exotic ingredients? Where did she get the time, the  energy?  I am in awe and wonder at this slice of I-don't-know-who's-life.  (By the way, the marriage broke up for good when she found her husband with  another man, which I saw coming from her very first description of him.)  Real food for thought, somesthing like reading farm journals of the pioneer  ladies who had to make their own soap, churn the butter, and sew all the  family's clothes....how did she do it all?  Where did all those guests come  from, to all those parties, in costumes yet!  How could she possibly  raise two children in the midst of this madness, and how did they turn out?  (They are given short shrift.)  She does not get my sympathy, but I found  this book fascinating. I give it four stars for presentation, but am  mystified as to what the ingredients are and how they got there.	1999-12-22

I do love a good juicy Hollywood biography, and this one fills the bill.  Mr. Eddie Fisher, (huge star in his day, nearly forgotten now), or as I like to call him, Mr. Cheeseball Extraordinaire, feels the present day climate is the right time to spill the beans on his life and loves, his ups and downs. The story is  very self-centered, of course, and I still can't understand the attraction  of Mr. Fisher to all those women. The last couple of chapters are rushed  and &#34;tacked on as an update&#34;. Annoyingly he never quite explains  just what it was he didn't like about Debbie Reynolds; like most men who  write these things he just basically says, 'we were just too different, we  just didn't get along', and leaves it at that. He does go into great detail  about La Liz (Taylor).  In my opinion the 50's era was a sorry time in  Hollywood history, the people seem a little dowdy, dated, and campy to read  about. I much prefer reading about the wonderful 30's and the wonderful  stars of that era.
