This is a deeply romantic and thrilling book, and one sure to make you relish the joys of life.<br /><br />The plot is simple:  a shy girl falls in love with this hunky young lad who is conscripted into Hitler's army.  He is at first dismayed by the prospect of dying for Nazi ideals and considers going AWOL and taking his sweetheart to South America.  It's at that point he lands a cushy job in the gasworks at Chelmno where he can safely sit out the war.<br /><br />Learning of this -- and having some Jewish blood herself -- the girl is understandably disgusted and on point of breaking up with him, when she notices that his biceps have been gaining in strength and definition from the constant exercise of the gas-release lever.<br /><br />Anyhow.

Woods\\".  Sheesh.<br /><br />Woods's translation is not new, folks, at least not to Vintage International.  It first came out in 1996 and they used it then in a slightly different edition.<br /><br />Yes, it is EXACTLY the same translation of the previous Vintage International edition of \\"The Magic Mountain,\\" which you may have seen in its previous incarnation:  it had exactly the same weight and size as this does but a bluish cover.  It has not been revised or amended or anything.<br /><br />I'm not saying Woods's is a bad translation or anything; it's just that it seems like with this slick new cover the folks at Vintage International are trying to get us Mann aficionados all in a bother by letting on like they have replaced some old stuffy translation [which saddled their older bluish edition] with this exciting new one, which you can obtain if you only purchase this new golden edition!<br /><br />Malarkey.  They're both the same John E. Woods translation.<br /><br />Just for clarification: the previous translation used by Vintage was the Lowe-Porter job (last issued by Vintage in 1992), which by now has come to be universally regarded as inferior to Woods's 1996 production, even though the author, Mann himself, assisted Lowe-Porter on some translations (including \\"Der Zauberberg\\") before Mann's death in 1955.<br /><br />Anyhow.

Reading it made me wish he had left the hardbound version, since that way it would have hurt more when I threw it back at him!<br /><br />It's a detective story, you see, featuring the inimitable Travis McGee, the beach bum cum gumshoe who appears in over a dozen MacDonald outings.<br /><br />What can I say about this book?  In one stroke, MacDonald has managed to outstrip Flaubert, Dostoevsky, and Joyce, making them all look like mewling infants.<br /><br />Here's just a sample of MacDonald's deathless prose:<br /><br />\\"And I suppose you had an affair with her.\\"<br />\\"Gee, honey.  I'd have to look it up.\\"<br />I caught her fist about five inches from my eye.  \\"You bahstid,\\" she said. [p. 32]<br /><br />Of course, MacDonald cannot be accused of being a superficial writer!  Consider these penetrating philosophical musings:<br /><br />\\"I own some Sears electric clippers with plastic gadgets of various shapes which fit on the clippers to keep you from accidentally peeling your hair off down to the skull.  I find that long hair is a damned nuisance on boats, on the beach, and in the water.  So when it gets long enough to start to make me aware of it, I clipper it off, doing the sides in the mirror and the back by feel.  The sun bleaches my hair and burns it and dries it out.  And the salt water makes it feel stiff and look like some kind of Dynel.  Were I going to keep it long, I would have to take care of it.  That would mean tonics and lotions and special shampoos.  That would mean brushing it and combing it a lot more than I do and somehow fastening it out of the way in a stiff breeze.\\" [pp. 123-124]<br /><br />But perhaps Travis, our hero, is at his most debonair when he's beating the snot out of recalicrant women:<br /><br />\\"I smiled at her, pulling her a half-step closer and said, 'If you get loud and say nasty things, dear, if you get on my nerves, I can hold you like this, and I can take this free hand and make a big fist like this, and I can give you one little pop right here that will give you a nose three inches wide and a quarter inch high.'<br />  'Please,' she said in a rusty little voice.<br />  'You can get a job as a clown.  Or you can see if you can find a surgeon willing to try to rebuild it.'\\" [p. 136]<br /><br />In sum, if you're in the mood for sappy, incoherent, misogynistic, and, well, all-around cruddy fiction, you can't go wrong with the peerless Travis McGee!<br /><br />(The author, John MacDonald, died in 1986, and therefore -- it tickles me to announce -- will not be inflicting any more of these books on us!

It reads naturally and does not contain too much slang.  The most impressive translation of Dostoevsky into English I've come across is Jesse Coulson's \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"  It's simply astonishing, but he never did \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\"<br /><br />NOTES ON OTHER TRANSLATIONS:<br /><br />*  The translation by Constance Garnett (many editions):  Avoid it!  High-toned and dense.  Will make reading \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" far more difficult than it has to be.  People who are into Dostoevsky really detest this translation:  it's tough going:  stale and stuffy throughout.  When will this thing die?  I'm guessing this is the translation used for so many cheap editions (e.g., Wordsworth Classics, Dover Thrift Editions, Penguin Popular Classics, etc.) because it's public domain by this point and the publishers don't have to pay anybody.<br /><br />*  The Pevear and Volokhonsky version (ISBN:  0374528373).  Several scholars of Dostoevsky have come out saying this is the \\"most faithful\\" translation to date, as the book's jacket does not neglect to point out.  However, other equally well-respected scholars have complained that it is breezy and inaccurate.<br /><br />*  The David MacDuff job (Penguin, ISBN: 0140449248).  Serviceable but not sparkling.  Also a bit slangy.  It does, however, do a great job with the footnotes.<br /><br />*  The Ignat Avsey effort (This is the one used by the Oxford World Classics:  ISBN:  0192835092).  I confess to never having negotiated this particular one, and can only warn you that it, like Garnett's above, is British English.  I have it on my shelf, though.  The one advantage I can see in this edition is that it, more than any of the others, has additional stuff to help you with the reading:  introduction, Dostoevsky chronology, list of characters, etc. but mainly a long section of EXPLANATORY NOTES at the back, which are keyed to the text via asterisks you find as you're reading.  Thus Avsey offers the best footnotes of any of these editions, although this is not one of those texts where that's gonna be a big deal.<br /><br />*  The David Magarshack translation.  Haven't read it.  Sorry.<br /><br />*  There is another edition I'm aware of:  The translation by Louis Hechenbleikner and the Princess Alexandra Kropotkin, which first came out in 1949 and for which W. Somerset Maugham wrote the introduction.  The translation has a fair reputation, but the problem is that it is so thoroughly out of print that you'd probably have to search through rare book shops to find it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  MacAndrew's read most swiftly and naturally for me.  It's like you're not even reading something that has been translated!<br /><br />(Note that Amazon's page on the MacAndrew edition [[ASIN:0553212168 The Brothers Karamazov (Bantam Classics)]] gives the impression, at least in declaring that the book is \\"by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Konstantin Mochulsky\\" that Konstantin Mochulski is the translator.  Not the case:  Mochulsky merely wrote the 10-page introduction.  The translator is still Andrew MacAndrew.)<br /><br />Anyhow.

On my way  out the door, I grabbed this book without thinking too much about the matter and over the course of the next few days finished the thing in my hospital bed.<br /><br />This proved to be a grievous mistake, since this book is non-stop horniness from beginning to end, folks.  And, being in the hospital, it got me quite bothered without my being able to do anything about it!<br /><br />As for its \\"literary merits,\\" I remain to be convinced.  I found it a bit too disorganized and superficial to merit much serious consideration.  It was almost as though Miller was too consumed by the mere thrill of writing what he was writing, and did not sit down and focus enough on story, tone, character, etc.  As if eloquently-written prurience would be enough to carry the day.<br /><br />Granted, the thing might be indispensable in the history of American letters, but you're telling me this is on the same plane as \\"A Fan's Notes,\\" \\"All the King's Men,\\" and \\"The Great Gatsby\\"?

It's read by two people:  one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.<br /><br />2.  The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it.  I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.<br /><br />3.  He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters.  Excellent French and Latin pronunciation.  His Italian and Spanish are less successful.  The woman is certifiably Irish.<br /><br />4.  There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.<br /><br />5.  If you're a Joyce scholar, you are doubtless using the Gabler edition of 1986, WHICH WASN'T THE EDITION USED FOR THIS.  I think they're actually using the 1922 edition!  Anyhow, this is a constant irritant for serious Joyce fanatics, as, since you are doubtless using Gabler, there'll be something in almost every paragraph that's just a whit different.

There are 22 CD's total.<br /><br />9.  You should buy it.  I had read Ulysses twice before I got it, and going through it with this CD set really opened up the book to me, in a way I couldn't have gotten with any other type of ancillary aid.  It was like reading the book for the first time!  Wasn't so incomprehensible after all!<br /><br />I should warn you that one thing you might find thoroughly infuriating is that the title tracks / id tags of the CD tracks are totally in chaos.  It's so bizarre, it smacks of sabotage.  (For example, the title track of the 1st track of the 2nd (!)

Perks supposedly include bed, breakfast, and THE SERVICES OF A FEMALE.<br /><br />Anthropologists (and many Arabists) swear the custom was not a myth -- up until about the 1960s, when television helped to unify the country's mores, bringing them more in line with those of Riyadh.<br /><br />Naturally such a free-love custom is directly contrary to Wahhabi Islam, of course.<br /><br />Anyhow, Walker, the narrator, has been hearing about this custom for years.  His students from the Asir (privately) swear to him it's not a myth, and students from other areas of the Kingdom angrily deny that such a custom ever (or could currently) exist.<br /><br />Well, on his last tour in KSA, Walker resolves to make an odyssey from Jedda down to the Asir, ostensibly to visit a former student but really to see if he can work himself into a situation where he is a recipient of this fabled \\"sexual hospitality.\\"<br /><br />In other words, he spends the book basically trying to get a free ride on a Saudi chick.<br /><br />Well, I won't tell you how it ends, but that plot line is what Walker uses to hang his observations about the Kingdom, about Arabs, Muslims, Saudis, and the rapid modernization of their world -- and what it is like for a Westerner to live and travel there.<br /><br />Most of the books about Saudi Arabia are either about how the Kingdom supports terror, about the coming revolution, about the oil wealth, etc.<br /><br />Not this one.<br /><br />It's witty, amusing, and incredibly well-written.

Is it a publisher's joke?<br /><br />You see, this dictionary was apparently first printed almost a hundred years ago (not sure exactly when), then reprinted in the 50s, the 70s, and again in about 2000.<br /><br />The thing is, it is nearly totally useless!  You won't learn any Arabic from it, because not only is the Arabic absurdly honorific and formal, but all the terms relate to an extinct society and its manners and objects.<br /><br />The book contains, I assure you, absolutely nothing useful, such as \\"Where can I find an ATM?\\" \\"Do I need a visa?\\" and \\"Where can I get a cab?\\"  In fact, there are no phrases in the book that would even imply the existence of cars, planes, or even electricity!<br /><br />Here are but a few samples of the laughable and totally useless phrases you will be learning:<br /><br />\\"Bring me a few jugs of water; I wish to have a bath.\\" (p. 93)<br /><br />\\"I want a bowl of barley-water.\\" (p. 102)<br /><br />\\"Capital!  I am all in a beat!\\" (p. 102)<br /><br />\\"What has befallen you?\\" (p. 46)<br /><br />\\"There is a big wave coming!\\" (p. 92) (useful in Riyadh)<br /><br />\\"Did not I tell you to look to the horse half an hour before sunrise?\\" (p. 129-130)<br /><br />\\"See if there is a farrier here who can shoe him.\\" (p. 138)<br /><br />I'm guessing, based on the technology referred to throughout the book, that it was written before World War I and Lawrence of Arabia!<br /><br />On the other hand, if you've traveled through the Middle East at all, this book will prove fascinating a glimpse into a world that simply doesn't exist anymore:  the world of Gulf Arabs before the oil wealth.<br /><br />And that world, at least based on the glimpse you get into it here, was simple, violent, and superstitious -- and eager to servilely please Western visitors.<br /><br />(By the way, romanized script is used in the text, not Arabic.

It will greatly reduce the number of people who will read my review of it.<br />2.  This book is a treasure!  Out of all the books in my library, this is unquestionably my most beloved volume that nobody has ever heard about.  I would be grief-stricken to lose it.<br /><br />Here's the dope with Snow:  he was a upper-class Brit who, having broken his leg at Eton and finding himself consequently exempt from military service, decided, a la Anthony Eden, to go adventuring in South America.<br /><br />The thing was, Snow didn't travel like ordinary people.  Resolutely refusing to learn any local language, for example, he would simply yell at the natives louder and louder, confident they would soon understand him.  Nor did he pack very well, study the terrain, immunize himself, formulate backup plans, etc.  It's a wonder he never got himself killed on one of these outings.<br /><br />In fact, Snow went on many kooky adventures during his life:  motorcycling through Lapland, traveling on foot through much of the Middle East, climbing a series of obscure South American peaks, etc.<br /><br />This book, \\"The Rucksack Man,\\" revolves around Snow's attempt (begun in 1973) to walk the entire length of the Americas, from Tierra del Fuego all the way up to the northern coast of Alaska (along the Pan-American Highway), a distance of approximately 15,000 miles.<br /><br />He never made it. Severe health problems forced him to take a hiatus shortly after crossing the Darien Gap, and he returned to England to recuperate.<br /><br />Angry and disgusted with himself, Snow attempted to resume his journey a few months later from the precise point at which he had interrupted it in Costa Rica.<br /><br />But, exhausted and mentally unstable, he was unable to muster the strength to complete this second half of his journey, giving up only a few weeks after having resumed.<br /><br />This book is therefore an account of the South America leg of the journey:  of all the things Snow saw and learned as he traveled, all the misadventures he had, the people he met, and all the wonders he was privileged to see walking through (pre-globalization) South America in the 70s.<br /><br />Folks, it's a gem.<br /><br />His writing style is an inimitable combination of wit, clarity, subtlety, compassion, and, above all, an endearing self-effacement:  \\"Walking,\\" writes Snow, \\"teaches you that nothing is ever as good -- or as bad -- as it first seems.\\"<br /><br />This is not Snow's only book.  \\"My Amazon Adventure\\" and \\"Half a Dozen of the Other,\\" are also entertaining, but lack the raw charm and simplicity of this one.  Sadly, all three are all out of print.<br /><br />Later in life he converted to Roman Catholicism , sired six children, and became an obscure chicken farmer in Devon.

For this purpose I would recommend either Stephen Slavin's \\"Macroeconomics\\" (8th Ed.), or, if you require more rigor, Mankiw's \\"Principles of Macroeconomics\\" (3rd Ed.), both of which are much easier on the math.<br /><br />Olivier's juggernaut is more appropriate as a freshman level text for finance or economics majors who are slated to do some heavy-duty number-crunching later in their college career.<br /><br />It is certainly NOT an intermediate text in macroeconomics (i.e., a junior-level text that incorporates integration and differentiation), so it would most profitably deployed in a rigorous or honors-level freshman-level class (in fact this is the standard text used in freshman econ at MIT -- its author is this brilliant French dude who sometimes teaches freshman econ there).<br /><br />So be not deceived:  this book assumes intermediate algebra, trigonometry, and even some (non-calculus) statistics.  There's also some nasty addition and multiplication!<br /><br />Though there's nothing in it beyond what a high school graduate ought to know, it would help to be clear on its demands.  Many freshman books I have thumbed through seem to require only beginning algebra, if that.  Not here: algebra is woven into the fiber of this book like a fingernail to the flesh, and any student unskilled in the equational arts will have a rotten time of things.<br /><br />One good thing about the book:  it comes with a cool CD on which you can manipulate the graphs, chapter by chapter, in a fun and instructive (and time-killing) way.<br /><br />One bad thing about the book:  although there are review questions and problem sets at the end of every chapter, there are no answers anywhere in the book.  Sheesh!  Presumably, given the math level required and the merciless tone of the text, we are meant to see this as a book for adult learners, so why are we being treated like children?

There.  I said it.<br /><br />Because of this, you really have to ask if this book is the wisest purchase for your needs.<br /><br />I'm one of those people who don't believe it is possible to teach economics meaningfully without resorting to unpleasant graphs and charts.<br /><br />But if you agree with me, what would you be doing with this book? It's not more engagingly written than your average college textbook; its examples are quite standard; and, because it is a paperback, many critical ideas are missing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a engaging and reader-friendly book that'll teach you about economics WITHOUT graphs and charts, well . . . I guess I would recommend either Buchholz's \\"From Here to Economy,\\" or Wheelan's \\"Naked Economics,\\" both well-known, helpful, and (as of this writing) reasonably current.<br /><br />However, if you need to learn some economics and have (quite sensibly) resigned yourself to the inevitability of charts and graphs, I would just go ahead with a solid freshman textbook:  Slavin's \\"Economics\\" (8th Ed.) could not be more student-friendly, while Mankiw's highly-regarded \\"Principles of Macroeconomics\\" (3rd Ed.) is less so but superlative in every way.<br /><br />As it is, since Friedman's little book is not noticeably cleverer, better-written, or more innovative than other books of its kind, the only advantage it seems to offer is its convenient paperback size, which makes it more conducive for reading in the tub.	2005-06-02

It's quite obviously bad for America in the short run, but will it make us more efficient in the long run, as Schumpeter's theories of \\"creative destruction\\" suggest?  It's nice to have a discussion of these matters by an accomplished and articulate economist.<br /><br />Buchholz lays out the reasons he believes the outsourcing blight has hit us, and, honestly, it's hard to disagree with him.  The major culprits?  Our educational system does not produce competitive workers, our immigration laws \\"chase away talent,\\" our tax laws encourage outsourcing, etc.<br /><br />I do disagree with him on one point:  I, like virtually everybody else, think our educational system sucks, but I don't see that as being a chief cause of outsourcing, so I wonder how clearly Buchholz has thought through the matter.<br /><br />I mean, the reason all those companies are hiring subcontinentals to do their computer programming for them is simply because it's cheaper.  The U.S. education system could be ten times better than it is, and this would still be happening.  100% of our high-school and college graduates could be masters of math, history, physics, programming, etc., and companies would still be hiring offshore workers because all they need is employees who can program C++ cheaper and broadband internet has now made it feasible to go halfway across the world to get them.<br /><br />Not that overhauling the education system wouldn't be a step in the right direction:  it definitely makes our workers less competitive.  I'm not as convinced as Buchholz is that this would reverse the outsourcing murrain.<br /><br />One other complaint:  I was hoping Buchholz, with his indisputable background in macroeconomics, would say something (offer a prediction?) about the relative benefits of outsourcing in the light of Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, which suggests that disasters of this sort can actually be blessings in disguise.  Alas!  No clear position was ever given.<br /><br />In any case it is a swift and informative read.oeconomics, would say something (offer a prediction?) about the relative benefits of outsourcing in the light of Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, which suggests that disasters of this sort can actually be blessings in disguise.

In case you don't know, Assata Shakur was a one-time Black Panther member who was accused of complicity in the murder of a New Jersey state trooper back in '73.  She was imprisoned, beaten, and tried -- finally escaping and making her way to Cuba as a political refugee, where she currently lives and works.<br /><br />Well, Assata's book is totally awful:  it's gotta be one of the worst \\"this-is-the-real-story\\" efforts I've ever read.  Nevertheless, the book is generally well-written and interesting.<br /><br />To explain myself:  I have long made a point of reading about and studying the cases of blacks who are falsely (or at least controversially) imprisoned.<br /><br />So I have read with great interest and profit books by Nelson Mandela, Ruben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, George Jackson, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Eldrige Cleaver, etc.<br /><br />Well, the reason I say Ms. Shakur's book is awful is this:<br /><br />Before picking it up, I knew nothing about her case. Unfortunately, now, after reading the book, I'm convinced that Assata was in fact responsible for that murder!<br /><br />And I maintain this is a major problem for the author, as sympathetic as I usually am to people - especially blacks -- in similar predicaments.  Since this is the only book I've read on the subject, I didn't come to it with any preconceptions except, if anything, prejudicial compassion.<br /><br />What a disaster.  I mean, when you write a book from prison (or exile), you've totally got the floor.  There are no editors; you can't be censored; it's all your point of view; you're totally in charge of what's said and what's not said, etc.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite total authorial control, when Assata tries to convince you she didn't do it, you just wind up not believing her.  Like I said, she can write well, but ultimately in vain.<br /><br />Message to Assata:  you've gotta ask yourself:  what are you doing at the typewriter?  If this, your only chance to clear your name, manages instead to convince readers that you in fact did it, why are you even bothering to write?  Just clam it and most people will give you the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Next time get someone else to write your story for you!

I get it!\\" most often.<br /><br />Not that this was always the case.  There were times when I found better explanations elsewhere (e.g., Chapter 19, on the foreign currency market, is exasperatingly elliptical and could use a major dummying-down), but more often than not, Mr. Mankiw had the goods: the clearest and most easy-to-follow way of wording or graphing a slippery or counter-intuitive concept.<br /><br />Of course, it's easy to hate Mr. Mankiw:  he's young, he's handsome, he's brilliant (one of the youngest full professors ever at Harvard), and he's rich (his textbooks are now standard in AP courses nationwide).  Jerk!<br /><br />Because of these reasons, I would love to trash his book, showing how it \\"ain't all that.\\"<br /><br />Well, it is.  Gulp.<br /><br />Only one note:  If you're planning on getting this book to study macroeconomics independently, you will find one irritating drawback:  there are exercises at the end of each chapter, but no answers in the back.

But now that I'm older and my tastes in literature are more sophisticated, I am unable to tell if Bradbury has gotten worse, or if I've just gotten more sophisticated, and therefore more difficult to please. I suppose we all have a critical blind spot for the stuff we grew up with.<br /><br />Well, anyhow, I hated this book.<br /><br />It took me a couple of readings just to understand what was going on. I've read it three times now, and it certainly hasn't repaid the effort. Bradbury seems unable to focus on (or even come up with) one good idea; the story seems like a hodge-podge of leftover purple phrases that wouldn't fit into other stories. Seems like Bradbury just saved up a few dozen of these phrases and decided to mash them all together in one story, a story which otherwise lacked any real plot.<br /><br />The worst problem about this book, though, is just that; really, there's no STORY. Just page after page of high-flown blather. Imaginative verbiage, but without any underlying interest. The dialogue is stiff and overwritten; it just doesn't PLAY.<br /><br />I'll probably never be able to answer the question whether Bradbury has gotten worse or not, but he's definitely done better than this.<br /><br />Also be warned that the publisher has seen fit not to number the pages. It's more mythical-poetic that way!	2005-05-13

Andrew's story is fairly absorbing as far as those of serial killers go, and Orth has collected an impressive mountain of facts about it. However, this book's shortcomings far outweigh any of its strong points:<br /><br />1. The text is fairly clogged with spelling errors and illiteracies of every kind. I mean, I'M embarrassed to read them, and I had nothing to do with the book!<br /><br />2. Why couldn't we have pictures? Because Orth didn't want to stoop to sensationalism? Then how to explain the completely inaccurate and misleading title? At no point is it ever alleged that Cunanan performed \\"vulgar favors\\" for Versace, hence I must conclude that that title was chosen only for the basest of reasons.<br /><br />3. There was no reason the book needed to be this long; it could have been much shorter and still effective. The author seemed unable to weed out uninteresting aspects of her story, instead dumping EVERY damn fact in her possession on us (e.g., do we really need two entire chapters on the history of the FBI's fliers?!?)<br /><br />4. Orth just can't seem to make the characters come alive, although she evidently suffered from no lack of rich material.<br /><br />5. Her prose style is mediocre and over-stylized at the same time.<br /><br />6. I suppose this is inevitable when writing the life of a serial killer, but here I must accuse Orth of \\"playing the ending\\" too much. What I mean is that she goes back into his life in high school (and before) reading all these sinister meanings into the most innocuous teenageisms (what high-school boy, for example, isn't a barefaced liar?). As if he'd spent his entire life preparing to go berserk and kill Versace. Brother!

Folks, it's merely a re-issue of their 1961 edition.<br /><br />Yes, they did add an absorbing \\"Special Addenda Section of New Words\\" toward the front of the dictionary (80-100pp, I'm guessing), but they couldn't be bothered to include these neologisms in the main text, presumably because resetting the 1961 proofs would have been too much work for Webster & co . . . ?<br /><br />And if Webster & Co. couldn't be bothered to alphabetize these news words into the main body of this dictionary, I'm guessing the poor overworked editors were too busy to correct errors and typos in the main text either! Why? What is Webster's doing now? Have they started a chain of hotels or something?<br /><br />I SOOOOO wanted to buy and love this book, and was SOOOOO angry to find it a con. I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />Admittedly, the neologism section was VERY interesting, but you're basically paying all that moolah for that, you should understand. Perhaps you should buy the book, photocopy this section, then return the book for a full refund the next day.<br /><br />Although this would be unethical, it was equally unethical, I feel, for Webster's to have grandly let on like they had drafted a completely new dictionary, when in fact they had done nothing of the kind.<br /><br />Another consideration for the prospective buyer is that ideas about readability (i.e. the use of fonts, boldface, and italics to make the text more negotiable) were a lot more primitive in 1961, and, naturally, nothing has been done about that, either. In other words, the columns are very hard on the eye.<br /><br />Until somebody comes along with another giant dictionary like this, but one that reflects true work and revision, I'm sticking with my old Random House.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've since read (about 2010) that Webster's is in fact working up a newly reworked unabridged dictionary, to be out soon -- of the sort that I was led to believe this was.  Maybe you should hold out for that one.Another consideration for the prospective buyer is that ideas about readability (i.e. the use of fonts, boldface, and italics to make the text more negotiable) were a lot more primitive in 1961, and, naturally, nothing has been done about that, either.

The Sidney Monas translation (published in the Signet edition) is unimaginative, limp, and lifeless, lacking the oft-remarked vigor of Dostoevsky's prose.  No, no:  Coulson has never been outdone.  Too bad he never did the Brothers K.<br /><br />The only drawback with the Coulson translation, I must say, is that this guy does inject a lot of British slang, much of which can't be precisely deciphered even with the aid of a good desk dictionary.  This is irritating.<br /><br />However, the clarity and force of his work more than makes up for that shortcoming.  He really knows how to make his characters speak differently, his descriptions are vivid and forceful, and the rhythm and dynamism of his prose can really knock you for a loop.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm not qualified to state whether all these characteristics were Dostoevsky's own and have merely been faithfully rendered into English by Coulson, or whether Coulson improved upon a stuffy and awkward original, as is perhaps suggested by the plethora of disagreeable translations.  All I know is that using this translation will make your descent into Raskolinkov's world much more rewarding and memorable.<br /><br />I should also note that the Coulson version is the translation employed in the Oxford World's Classics edition, which is also in print and available from Amazon.  Naturally, that edition doesn't have all the critical essays the Norton edition has, but its footnotes are far more numerous and superior.	2005-05-10

I can't quite put my finger on just what was so unsatisfactory about it, but the author never really communicates, if you can understand that.<br /><br />There remains throughout an imposing wall, a gulf, between the narrator and the reader, an invisible barrier of motivation and understanding that Lethem is unable to break down.<br /><br />No.  If you're gonna write, you've really gotta put your heart on the page.  There must be a million ways to do this, but at some point you've got to lay yourself bare and put it on the line.  It seems that Lethem knows a million ways to avoid doing just this:  humor, anecdotes, trivia, etc.<br /><br />Reading the essays, you keep asking yourself vital questions about character and circumstance that never get answered.  In the end, the book will prove to be a disappointment both for fans of pop culture and for aficionados of the personal essay.<br /><br />Again, I'm not sure what's going on here.  Lethem writes about very sensitive and personal topics, but his style is so cluttered with distractions and vague expressions that in the end you finish the book feeling that you not only haven't come to know the author, but you haven't really learned anything about anything or anybody.<br /><br />Or been entertained.	2005-05-06

The binding on them is not superior.<br /><br />The text itself is certainly not awful, but I will make four points:<br /><br />1.  Churchill is rightly regarded as being one of the finest prose stylists in the English language, and I do not think this judgment to be far off the mark.  However, you likely won't get the same impression from these books, which are written in -- how can I put it? -- a kind of newspapery and insidery style that people who haven't lived through the war will have immense difficulty following.<br /><br />There are references to public figures, places, and long-dead political arrangements that might have been common knowledge in the 40s and 50s, but which you are now likely to find quite abstruse and off-putting.  Churchill, writing in a kind of shorthand which glibly and copiously refers to all these things, was essentially, it seems to me, writing to his contemporaries.  There are no footnotes to explain such references, either.<br /><br />2.  If you have a hankering to see what people are talking about when they claim Churchill is a master of expository prose, check out \\"The River War.\\"  His power and peerless grace is much more evident there.<br /><br />3.  Throughout his narrative Churchill heavily emphasizes the role of Britain in the war -- especially during the time when he was in charge.  Guess this is no surprise, though.<br /><br />4.  If you really want a superb and exhaustive narrative history of WWII, Liddell Hart's efforts have yet to be surpassed.  They're a little heavy on the military side of things, though.	2005-05-05

It's just that the author is a little too professional to get into the kind of vicious nitpicking that you might expect, given recent lurid developments (obesity lawsuits, bombings of McDonald's, etc.).<br /><br />No, this book is more of a mature, considered chronicle of the overall health and strategy of the corporation as a whole than a series of cheap take-downs.<br /><br />True, Love does criticize McDonald's from time to time, but it's not in particularly vicious terms.  For example, in the later chapters, he analyzes in some depth the company's ill-fated diversification strategy in the early 90s.  He also happily delves into several of Kroc's kooky, doomed ideas.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the \\"minor hiccoughs\\" in the company's recent history (e.g., that French farmer that raised a ruckus, that British couple who have devoted their lives to taking them down) are so well-known and fascinating that their absence is keenly felt.  And what interesting reading they would have made, given Love's scholarship and even-handedness.<br /><br />So, while Love is willing, from time to time, to cast a negative light on McDonald's, for the most part the book is a straight macroeconomic history by a man who obviously admires but is not overly-reverential of one of the world's greatest corporations.<br /><br />If you find that to your liking, you will certainly declare the book an entertaining and useful read -- especially if you're stuck having to write a serious, no-nonsense paper about the chain's corporate strategy, say for a business class.	2005-05-05

She's basically ruining his life.  So was this defect compensated for by an exhausting and innovative performance in the boudoir?<br /><br />Indeed, it's a \\"vital and obvious question\\" (Tillotson's phrase), which Dickens, inexplicably, never addresses satisfactorily:  the reader is simply left to wonder.<br /><br />As a result of this regrettable oversight (or failing), I am forced to agree with Alfred Kazin, when he notes archly that Dickens's unfortunate decision to give this \\"burning issue\\" the short shrift \\"seriously hobbles the merit of an otherwise promising tale.\\"	2005-05-05

Fatally, however, the guy can't seem to write in a natural, lucid way.<br /><br />Here's a sample of the kind of opaque, gummy prose you're in store for if you tackle this book [p. 144]:<br /><br />\\"Only selective forgetting of the past lets us move on, taking what was once dubious as the most banal of certainties, what was gained through struggle as our birthright.  So with zero.  The sermons it spoke in place-holding shrank to a letter of our thinking's alphabet, its volumes on solving equations to a sentence in mathematical primers.\\"<br /><br />And this is quite typical.

Mennis.  Also immensely useful is the \\"Guide to Economic Indicators\\" by the editors of the British magazine, the Economist (also useful for Americans).  Both are available on Amazon.<br /><br />If, however, you are merely looking for an entertaining and informative precis of contemporary economic issues and aren't planning on doing anything knowledge-requiring with your money, this book simply will not do.

You don't want to embarrass people, you don't want to strain friendships, you have so much invested, your friends will think you foolish, etc.  And yet you are unsuppressibly aware the whole thing is horse-puckey.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is certainly not an \\"expose\\" of Buddhism, or even of Rinpoche.  It is clear that Butterfield has a high opinion of most of his co-religionists and is not necessarily out to take off Rinopoche's head or discredit the religion.<br /><br />Rather, it is a respectful and thoughtfully-woven account of the author's years of involvement with this group, and how he grew to be dissatisfied personally with its teachings and practices.<br /><br />And happily, this book is not so beset with specialized Buddhist terms that only the initiated could navigate it.  I've seen some of those.  No, it's fine material for a general reader, or for somebody just getting into Buddhism.	2005-05-05

But my verdict stands.<br /><br />The reason I call book useless is that, believe it or not, it's almost as impenetrable as the text it purports to explain!  Perhaps this was because the author, Stuart Gilbert, was actually a friend of Joyce's, and Joyce actually helped him write it.  Note also that it was written only 8 years after the publication of \\"Ulysses\\" -- in 1930.<br /><br />As such, it was seminal in laying out a lot of the main themes of the novel (Gilbert's famous \\"schemata\\" is still referred to these days).  Seminal, yeah -- but the tone, level, and direction of Joyce criticism (not to mention the literary preparation of would-be exegetes of \\"Ulysses\\") have undergone much change in the last 75 years, to say the least.<br /><br />Sound flippant?  Well, be aware that, in addition to being completely conversant with all of English and continental literature, Gilbert expects you to be able to negotiate classical Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and German, much as \\"Ulysses\\" does.  Quotations and allusions in these languages are liberally sprinkled throughout the book -- and the footnotes explaning them contain not translations but even more abstruse glosses!<br /><br />The whole premise is ridiculous.  I can't see who would possibly be helped by this book, despite the fact that nearly all of the various editions of \\"Ulysses\\" cite it as helpful secondary reading.  For accomplished critics, perhaps.  But for the average reader out there, the searingly obviously problem is that anybody in possession of the cultural firepower and reading acumen needed to read this book . . . would have no need of its insights!  If you can understand Gilbert, you sure as a shot could understand Joyce without much assistance.  Was Gilbert writing to himself?<br /><br />Yes, best steer thee elsewhere.  There's something out there called the \\"New Bloomsday Book\\" (careful you don't unnecessarily buy the hardback), which most students these days find far more helpful and more in consonance with their needs and sensibilities.<br /><br />Of the various kinds of \\"Cliff's Notes\\" out there, probably the most useful is the original, the black-and-yellow striped \\"Cliff's Notes,\\" followed closely by the \\"ClassicNotes.\\"  Avoid the Sparknotes and the Barron's.ed the \\"New Bloomsday Book\\" (careful you don't unnecessarily buy the hardback), which most students these days find far more helpful and more in consonance with their needs and sensibilities.

It also contains an exhaustive section on analytic geometry.<br /><br />If you have sloughed off through algebra and trigonometry, or if you are coming to calculus after a long hiatus, this is the book to get.<br /><br />This is because instead of launching directly into integration, the book's first couple of chapters (long chapters, too) are a careful review of just the principles you'll need from alegbra to get going.<br /><br />There are even appendices at the end of the book covering various math ideas needed for the study of calculus (e.g., trigonometry), so you can be sure that if you're coming into calculus getting weak in the knees, this book has all the information you need.<br /><br />In fact, I might be so bold as to point out that a determined student could conceivably skip from a study of elementary algebra directly to calculus because the book is laid out this way.<br /><br />Also, the book's language is very simple, so if, for example, English is not your first language, this is a good choice for you.  Complicated language and difficult cultural points are kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Having said all that, I should point out that this book is not one for self-learners.

It involves a teacher's lesson getting completely out of control.<br /><br />The whole thing turns into quite the page-turner when you learn that it is more or less based on a true story!<br /><br />Incidentally, if you'd like to investigate further, the actual classroom experiment was called \\"The Third Wave.\\"  It was thought up by a history teacher named Ron Jones at Cubberly High School in Palo Alto, California in 1969.<br /><br />The teacher reportedly thought up his \\"program\\" as a way of responding to his students' professed bafflement and disbelief that a civilized nation like Germany would have so obediently followed its mustachioed leader into war and barbarity.<br /><br />This book, incidentally, is merely a novelization of a ABC after-school special that aired in 1981 (it says it was \\"based on the teleplay\\").  The story was recently (2008) adapted into a full-length but much more fictionalized movie released in theaters.  But that was a German movie (Die Welle).  The director was Dennis Gansel.

The author writes in a clear, down-to-earth, non-stuffy tone that makes reading the text easy and, well, as painless as you're gonna get.  He explains complicated economic graphs, curves, and concepts in plain, easy-to-understand language.<br /><br />2.  Very little math, other than rudimentary arithmetic and division, is required for this book.  This can be great if the teacher is unsure about his students' math abilities.  I have found that many economics textbooks complicate explanations mathematically without really adding much to anybody's understanding:  Slavin does not do this.  Even basic algebra is not required to navigate through this book.<br /><br />3.  It's cheap.  Amazon's price will change now and again, but the price is easily half that of other comparable economics texts, such as Mankiw's and Blanchard's.  This is great if the teacher knows that affordability is a major concern for the students.<br /><br />As for Slavin's politics, I would agree that his stance on many issues can be inferred from his discussions of them in the book.  However, the discussions are always fair and not tendentious.<br /><br />For example, when discussing what \\"full employment\\" consists of, he says something like:  \\"We'll take 5% as representing an economy's full employment.  Why?  Simply because this is a compromise between the 4% favored by liberals and the 6% favored by conservatives.\\"<br /><br />So the book is not so much tendentious as forthcoming and even-handed.  I feel the other reviews unfairly paint this text as the screed of some unbalanced liberal.  Although I do not agree with the author on many issues, this is simply not the impression I got with the book:  I was very satisfied with it.y satisfied with it.	2005-04-05

Both of them have the same covers, the same author, the same everything: but there is a world of difference between the two.<br /><br />In short, go with the latter, called (inconspicuously) the \\"Revised Edition.\\"  (Many websites are selling both indiscriminately; Amazon is not -- the one on this page is safe to buy.)  The one from 1989 is ridiculously outdated:  it still makes many references to the Soviet Union; the dollar is still strong; the Euro has yet to come into existence; the Asian Tigers have yet to rise, etc.  It's like watching a TV show from the 70s!<br /><br />Now, to the book itself:  it is amusing and informative, but it is seriously misnamed.  A more accurate -- but not as catchy -- title would have been:  \\"A Precis of Modern Economic Thought via the Ideas of the Great Economists.\\"  For that is, ultimately, what you're getting.  The ideas are certainly not \\"new,\\" except perhaps from the point of view of someone who was previously ignorant of them.<br /><br />The book proceeds -- in narrative fashion and without graphs -- to give a chronological history of economics by means of the ideas of the great economists.  One strong point in the author's approach is that even when you feel he's ardently at variance with an idea whose discussion is required, he is still very fair to it.<br /><br />Specialized knowledge of economics, math, or history is not required, and the author does much to keep the book readable.<br /><br />Alas! the book gets bogged down in the later stages, when discussing the debate between the Keynesians and the monetarists.  It just goes on forever:  I don't feel that Buchholz did a particularly noteworthy job of reducing the complexities of this issue for lay readers -- or even making it interesting for them.<br /><br />Despite these problems, you will learn something from reading this, unless you are already familiar with the economists and the ideas he discusses.  But if that's the case, what you're doing with the book in the first place is beyond me.lready familiar with the economists and the ideas he discusses.

Allen has a lot that you need to hear, and you probably have not heard it before.<br /><br />The book, unlike most college guide books, is not carefully divided based on colleges or regions.  Instead, it has more of a narrative structure, although the chapters are divided by aspects of the admissions process.<br /><br />However, it's very absorbing and witty writing.  So interesting that I read it from cover to cover, even though I'm even not in the market for going to college!  It was a real eye-opener.<br /><br />I do have some complaints, though.  Don't get the wrong idea from them, however.  Allen's work is, overall, is a brisk, useful, and amusing read.  And the gripes are:<br /><br />1.  The book is written almost exclusively for traditional college applicants (i.e., 17 years old, currently in high school, etc.)  Non-traditional or transfer applicants will therefore find the book's strategies largely (but not entirely) useless.<br /><br />2.  The thing was evidently hastily written:  there are countless typos, misspellings, printer's errors, etc.  Likely this won't bother you too much given your probable reasons for picking it up in the first place, but it does make me wonder about the reliability of the numbers Allen is reporting.  Here, for example, is a disturbing contradiction:  [p. 186]<br /><br />\\". . . Yale filled 43% of available seats for the Class of 2007 with Early Decision applicants, and those applicants were admitted at a 22% rate . . .\\"<br /><br />and then, later, in the same paragraph (!):<br /><br />\\"A small number of top colleges . . . most notably Yale, do not fill a significant portion of the freshman class with early decision candidates.\\"<br /><br />3.  The author has what appears to be a very low opinion of UC Berkeley, in contrast to the majority of students, teachers, and college counselors I have worked with.  Though this is never stated explicitly, his dissenting view is unmistakable:<br /><br />\\"Of the roughly thirty top colleges in America, only six -- the Air Force Academy, Cal Tech, Stanford, Rice, U. Chicago and Northwestern -- aren't on the east coast. [p. 241]\\"<br /><br />4.  The thing is seriously disorganized.  The author, aware of this, warns you about this upfront, but still, it's disorganized all the same.  As just one example, suppose you only need help  with your essay.  So you read his essay section.  Unknown to you, there is a lot of potentially useful information on college essays in the \\"strategies\\" section which you wouldn't have discovered if you had merely dipped into the \\"essay\\" section.<br /><br />The only solution is to read the entire thing through from cover to cover.

I started at the beginning and kept turning the pages until I got all the way to the end.  That was when I finished it.  I am so proud of myself!investment multipliers, but investment may depend more on the interest rate -- which is why Keynesians insist the demand curve for money is flat; 6) since, after the government deficit spends, there is less money available for private investment, government spending has negative implications for the growth of our capital stock; and 7) it's simply too tempting for Congress to deficit spend even when times are good (as did Bush), a course which, if done too often, will simply increase the national debt and thus, in the long run, increase taxes and impair productivity growth.    Convinced?  Well, unfortunately, Hazlitt doesn't cover any of these quite solid objections and thus, for a book pretending to flog Keynesianism, this volume cannot be accounted useful.  Hazlitt's positions are nowhere near as insightful or as meticulously argued as Friedman's were (whose countertheories hinged chiefly on delineating how changes implemented by the government will come around too little, too late for them to make any difference).  The deepest Hazlitt goes seems to be that \\"spending left and right\\" when you're in a jam seems unnatural to him, inimical to the Protestant work ethic, disanalogous to what you'd do if it were your personal finances, and, well, contrary to all Christian decency!    No, Hazlitt hasn't a tenth of Friedman's wit, depth, or quantitative wherewithal; nor has he anything approaching his writing skill.  (That single paragraph I wrote above has far more depth as a critique of Keynesianism than Hazlitt's entire book does.)  Worst of all, Hazlitt isn't really here to teach you (as the book's title suggests); he's here to convince you - to persuade you that everybody else is wrong and that only he is right, and that the phenomenal (overall) success of the U.S. economy over the past 50 years -- at least as of his writing -- hadn't really happened.    The upshot is that nobody, NOBODY, will get anything out of this book.  Here's why:    1) If you're a rank beginnerat economics, this elliptical, poorly argued, and ineffectively organized book will either mislead or confuse you without teaching you anything substantial or correct.    2) If you're halfway competent at economics, you'll demand mathematical and model-based support for Hazlitt's ideas, all of which is conspicuously missing.    3) If you're really good at economics, this book is so patently wrong, poorly reasoned, petulant, and generally puerile that it's not even worth reading.    Having said all this, I will concede that Hazlitt does come through here and there with occasional flashes of sense (such as in the last few pages, when he talks about Social Security).  However, \\"occasional flashes of sense\\" should hardly be taken as a warm recommendation when we're talking about an economics book.  By this point the standard is a lot higher.    One problem with reviewing this book is that it's taken as almost sacred, almost off-limits by certain people, mainly libertarians and Austrians.  It's like they refuse to engage it on the level of ideas, and instead resort to ad hominems if Hazlitt's book isn't granted a kaaba-like level of respect (v. comments infra).    There's another book professing to be a one-volume precis of economic principles called \\"Naked Economics.\\"  If you're coming to Hazlitt merely to acquire a quick understanding of some basic economic principles or to become economically literate in a big hurry, I would definitely advise you go there instead.  It's everything this book was trying to be.    Also avoid \\"The Armchair Economist.\\"	2005-03-06

This is a big, thick, very boring book from a man who nevertheless knows his subject well.  It's basically a history of how the \\"human sciences\\" (sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, etc.) got started and developed over the years.  There are no graphs or pictures; it's all narrative.<br /><br />Alas!  This is a aggravatingly stuffy slog, although, as I say, you can't complain about its thoroughness.  The problem, in my view, is neither the subject matter nor the approach:  it's Smith's writing style.  If you don't actually have the book in front of you, it's possible to convince yourself that it might be worth your time.  No.  So dry and lifeless is the writing that the book's other merits (e.g., the versatility and erudition with which the different disciplines are interwoven) never have a chance to see the light of day.<br /><br />True, I was expecting a lot from it:  the development of the social sciences is a very fecund subject; I guess I was hoping it would be as engaging, as riveting, and as thought-provoking as, for example, one of Boorstin's outings.<br /><br />And what a shame, too, since this could have been written so much better.  In a way, I'm hoping hope that somebody here will rush to this book's defense, since the author obviously put a ton of work into it.  But even so, that wouldn't make it a better read.<br /><br />In short: a fertile subject, but one that, sadly, still awaits a magisterial treatment.	2005-01-15

Truss, the author, is British, and their punctuation system is often different from the one we use in the States.  The problem is, this book wasn't really edited (and certainly not re-written by Truss) for its American release, so many of the points she makes (e.g., about \\"U.K.\\" or \\"UK\\", or the varying uses of the  ' versus the \\") fall flat, as the rules she so humorously reminds us of are not the actual rules we use in the States.

Both are wearisome, and, indeed, it is hard to see how ANY screen version could succeed:  the story James has to tell is internal, psychological, and verbal; not external, visual, and action-filled.  So any director who takes this material in hand will definitely have the cards stacked against him.<br /><br />Er, so lemme talk about the book itself . . .<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about James's involved, ornate prose:  I would definitely sympathize.  Certainly, you can't have ADD if you want to tackle this book:  there are hundreds of pages at a time consisting of what seems like mere wordage, without much happening.<br /><br />In defense of this, I can only say that the elegance of the prose itself evokes the elegance of James's world, yet there is something sinister lurking underneath the prose; in the same way that, I submit, James is suggesting that something sinister is lurking under the superficialities of this high-hushed world.  All this, of course, is symbolized by the elegant bowl itself, with its subsurface but fatal crack.<br /><br />Having said that, I do think that the book is somewhat overrated.  It's difficult for me, at least, to see what I have in common with or why I should care about a group of hideously rich snobs that have lived on the earth for decades without doing much good for anybody.  And it's not just that:  after hundreds of pages of James's dizzying verbiage, one begins to wonder if the author, despite his being able to write like an angel, had, in fact, anything at all to say.  Certainly when compared to that of his peers (Conrad, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Melville -- or even Dickens) James's oeuvre -- this especially -- seems a little anemic in the \\"interest of subject matter\\" and \\"what he's trying to say\\" columns.<br /><br />On the other hand, the world evoked in the book, not to mention the (verbose) manner of its evocation, is dead, dead, dead to us.  That is, both the language of the book and its world come from a time that has passed from the earth utterly.<br /><br />For example:  the specter of adultery hangs over the novel, everything the characters think and say, in a way that is difficult to take seriously these days.  Same with divorce, something which was, to these people, abhorrent and unthinkable.  In the age of drive-thru wedding (and divorce) services, it's an uphill battle taking these characters' problems as seriously as they take them.<br /><br />To conclude:  if you're the kind of person who would be attracted to (and able to finish) this sort of book, if you have what it takes to get into this vanished world . . . well, you certainly don't need my help or encouragement.d \\"what he's trying to say\\" columns.<br /><br />On the other hand, the world evoked in the book, not to mention the (verbose) manner of its evocation, is dead, dead, dead to us.

It's the kind of book that makes me sorry that I'm the kind of person who insists on finishing every book I start, since Chua has wasted irretrievable hours of my life.<br /><br />I read a great number of books about politics and current events and, while there is a great deal of mediocrity out there, this book is in a class of its own.  It's just silly.<br /><br />Chua siezes on a paradigm and then bends everything to fit it, despite her protests that she is carefully avoiding such reductionism.<br /><br />The book could have been boiled down to a monograph of about 10 pages; for what we have here, really, is just another Washington Post essay -- and not a very insightful one.<br /><br />For a much better treatment of the same ideas (er, same IDEA, that is, her Ahabian fetish with \\"market-dominant minorities\\"), I would instead recommend Niall Ferguson's \\"Colossus,\\" which covers all of the same territory, although in a much more substantial and well-researched fashion.	2004-11-05

Heck, Greene (at least here) isn't even enough of a wordsmith to convincingly evoke l'Indochine in the 50's, so it's not even much of a travel book.  I found myself doing much of the work in that regard.<br /><br />Obviously, the characters as \\"representative\\" of their nation's philosophies (the Brit as cynic, the American as idealist, etc.) is well-taken, though I thought the device was heavy-handed and unproductive.<br /><br />Another thing that, I think, had this book rolling on a flat tire was Greene's \\"in medias res\\" beginning, in which he reveals Pyle's death, etc.  Although this intially seemed competent, in retrospect it robbed the rest of the story of whatever interest or suspense it would otherwise have had.	2004-11-05

Now, however, returning to it years later (and having read in the meantime dozens of books on anthropology and anthropological issues, and having thought for years about what I thought I learned in this book) I'm not so sure it's as perceptive as I thought.  In other words, I think what I may have found mind-blowing in my younger years was the insights of anthropology itself -- not so much the contributions of Ms. Douglas.<br /><br />Having said that, there are four or five extremely interesting observations herein that will help explain, or at least clarify, some puzzling issues:  why gangs \\"jump\\" initiates, why Muslims do not permit nonbelievers to enter Mecca, why frats \\"haze\\" their new recruits, etc., although you pretty much have to fill in those blanks for yourself:  Ms. Douglas does not explicitly extend her theories to cover such aspects of modern society.  I used to think the book was deep; now, I think (in general) that she doesn't go far enough with her theories, instead stopping short just when things are getting interesting.<br /><br />Another unfortunate aspect of this book is that the author felt it necessary, in the first few chapters, to refute previous, erroneous ideas about filth and pollution.  Unfortunately, many of the theories she refers to are complicated and difficult to follow, at least before you read the rest of the book.  In other words, I think she should have left that section for last, instead just launching into her conclusions directly.	2004-11-05

While the material is well-written and well-researched, the author seems incapable of making his subject matter come alive, or writing efficiently or effectively.  The whole performance is more or less forgettable.<br /><br />Sure, it's an important issue, but after the first twenty pages or so, you pretty much \\"get it,\\" and all the anecdotes and graphs after that are essentially superfluous.<br /><br />Manning, furthermore, certainly has a bone to pick.  And while agree with pretty much his entire position, I couldn't help feeling this makes him less than trustworthy.<br /><br />To wit:  subscribing, as he obviously does, to the Puritan notions of saving, paying-as-you-go, the shame of bankruptcy, etc., he reveals nothing but disdain for the outrageous way the world seems to work these days.  In the end I felt this book was much more effective as a lament for the lost virtue of prudence rather than a sober analysis of \\"the consequences of America's addiction to credit.\\"<br /><br />Nearly all of his \\"case histories,\\" for example, are negative.  So-and-so was ruined by his improvident use of plastic.  So-and-so recklessly lived for the moment.<br /><br />But what Manning de-emphasizes -- or even ignores -- are the many cases in which credit cards frequently allow members of the underclass to travel, complete their education, change jobs, extricate themselves from some unforeseen difficulty, etc., and then pay dearly for it later, or perhaps even Chapter 10 it away.  No, all of that stuff is shunted aside in favor of focusing on how disgraceful everybody's behavior is.<br /><br />In summation:  not as jam-packed with insights and interesting facts as I thought it would be.  Further, what \\"facts\\" the book does have to offer, unfortunately, are so unremarkable and tendentious that they could probably be sketched out, at least in their general thrust, by one who has simply been apprised of the author's stance, without actually having read the book himself.r is. <br /> <br />In summation:  not as jam-packed with insights and interesting facts as I thought it would be.

When in fact I was in the comfort of my reclining chair the whole time.<br /><br />One thing that struck me as strange about the book is that the author -- unless he's writing under a persona -- had a major heroin problem the entire time he was covering the war!  Whoa!  I had thought that war correspondents would be the kind of people to have their act together on so many levels, but I guess not. . .<br /><br />Anyhow, a good portion of the book deals with the author's experiences with heroin and his relationship with his father.  This stuff is by no means bad; it's just not what I was expecting to read.<br /><br />Regrettably, I am still confused about this war:  who was fighting, and why, etc.  This book will certainly not clear that up for you:  Loyd expects you to know who the Serbs, Bosnians, and Croats are before you come to its pages.  So don't expect that to be explained here.<br /><br />But a fine book anyhow.  Loyd is a master of the kind of sinewy, spare prose that is a perfect vehicle for the rendering of a war.<br /><br />The atrocities he describes will not easily be forgotten -- that aspect of Loyd's writing does not come up short.<br /><br />But the central merit of this book, I feel, lies not in the way it describes horrors so much as in the way it details how all the blood and fear gradually starts to take a toll on a bystander.  In the end it stands as a vivid delineation of the process by which you becomes jaded and \\"inured,\\" even if you think that's never gonna happen to you.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have since forgotten the atrocities he describes.	2004-09-19

It seemed to reduce the suspense and focus.<br />Also, such scenes as the evil gang of little kids are much more effective visually than they are in print.<br />One of the reasons, I suppose, that I found the movie so creepy and disturbing was because there was this desolated, lonely atmosphere to everything, implying, in a way, that the schoolboys were actors of mythic stature at the beginning of an empty world.  Nothing but the Brothers and them.  I think this is due, however, to the movie's being brought off on a shoestring budget; I'm not sure the director intended it this way.  Whatever the case may be, this thing -- this central excellence of the film, in my view -- is totally missing from the book.<br />I think the author was going for a kind of William Golding-type idea, but I don't think he succeeds anywhere near as that other author.  He depicts evil, sure enough, but it just doesn't seem to have enough grip or intensity to be compelling.<br />However, on balance, a worthwhile read.  Who can't identify with the degrading chocolate sales that every American school -- both public and private -- \\"invite\\" their students to participate in?<br />More development of the reader's sympathy for Jerry, the central character, would certainly have helped.	2004-06-17

The book has a lot of discussion about themes prevalent in the art and literature of the later Middle Ages, but it's not a \\"history\\":  it doesn't tell you what happened.<br /><br />For example, to make a point about fastidious medieval protocol, Huizinga relates an anecdote about the battle of Crecy.  But he never explains what the battle was, who fought in it, or why it was important.  He assumes you already know that stuff, so don't come to this book looking for a more straightforward history.  This is more a discussion of the major themes and movements of the age, divided by chapter.<br /><br />Another thing you should know:  the lion's share of the discussion in the book has to do with the low countries.	2004-02-05

This is not an \\"old\\" book, like The Book of Five Rings or Hagakure.  It was written in the 1900's.<br />2  It's a book of short stories, not a novel or even a novella (together the stories total only 109 pages.)<br />3  Yes, Kurosawa's film was based on one of the stories, \\"In a Grove,\\" which examines the circumstances of a rape from differing points of view.  This story is about 13 pages.  While the story is not bad, I would imagine that one would have to be a pretty hard-core fan of that film to buy this book just for that.<br />4.  There is, however, a story called \\"Rashomon\\" in this collection, but this heavy-handed tale has little connection to the Kurosawa film, though Kurosawa may have lifted the tone and setting of his film's opening from the opening of this story.  For you to decide.<br />5. What is or was the \\"Rashomon\\"?  This is something I didn't know...  To quote from the book (31n):  \\"The 'Rashomon' was the largest gate in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan.  It was 106 feet wide and 26 feet deep, and was topped with a ridge-pole; its stone-wall rose 75 feet high.  This gate was constructed in 789 when the then capital of Japan was transferred to Kyoto.  With the decline of West Kyoto, the gate fell into bad repair, cracking and crumbling in many places, and became a hide-out for thieves and robbers and a place for abandoning unclaimed corpses.\\"	2003-04-27

Although Severin partially covers this angle in the last (and definitely most engrossing) chapter, this is certainly NOT what this book is about on the whole.<br /><br />Severin himself touches on this [p. 52]:  \\"The animal Melville had in mind was probably inspired by reading a short story in an American magazine, The Knickerbocker, in 1839.  The piece was called `Mocha Dick or the White Whale of the Pacific' and it was a yarn about a big bull sperm whale regularly encountered off the coat of Chile.  The animal was said to be `as white as wool', though whether because it was an albino or from old age was not known.\\"<br /><br />But this is virtually the only mention Severin makes of this mysterious beast.<br /><br />So what is it about?  For a period of about a year and a half the author roamed through Oceania staying and talking with various whale-hunting communities, for the most part learning about their lifestyles but occasionally exploring the subject of a white sperm whale, which, as Severin is eager to demonstrate, is not limited to Western literature, but makes an appearance in the myths and legends of societies far different from our own.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the lifestyles of these primitive whaling communities, for the most part, do not make for interesting reading (the section on Lamalera is especially yawn-inducing), and several times during my reading I wondered why I was even bothering to finish it.<br /><br />Other sections leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, such as when Severin digs up and exposes Melville's many exaggerations.  Every author's worst nightmare!  Here's a sample:<br /><br />\\"[In Typee], Melville describes how the natives of Taipivai were very keen to tattoo their sailor visitor.  They point out that his white skin would make such a perfect canvas for their art.  Mehevi also wants him to be tattooed, and suggests suitable patterns.  The tattooer-in-chief pursues Melville about the village waving his instruments, the sharp-toothed combs and tapping mallet.  Yet somehow Melville avoids the operation, and he does not explicitly state how.  It is another example of Melville building up suitably colourful ordeals while `living among the cannibals', but then sidling away from any clear explanation of how he emerged intact.  Certainly Melville had no tattoos to display when he returned to new England and told an intrigued audience about his `four months' on the Marquesas, though tattoos were already common enough among Western sailors of his day.\\"<br /><br />Just what every writer needs.  A good deal of the book consists of ill-spirited detective work of this kind, most of which is not even germane to Severin's stated purposes.<br /><br />Conclusion:  if you are looking for extra information on the facts behind white whale legends of the mid 1800's, don't look here.  The closest book I know of that addresses the question of whether a white whale actually existed (an actual white whale, not just an ordinary black, though perhaps unusually aggressive, sperm whale-like the one that famously smashed up the Essex) would be Norton's \\"Moby Dick as Doubloon,\\" and even that book only touches on the matter.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is far from awful.  The writing style is brisk and deft, and what Severin has learned on his travels/studies can on occasion be absorbing.  It's just that you should know what you're getting into.<br /><br />Moreover, the soft cover edition is handsomely printed, though it could really have used some maps.<br /><br />Ishould also note that this book can boast a top-notch first paragraph.  Don't let that fool you, though., though.	2002-09-02

I bought this book chiefly because I am a fan of Sergio Aragones' artwork; I am only a mild fan of Star Wars stuff.<br /><br />I was not blown away by the quality or humor of the Aragones illustrations herein: there are not a lot of them, and none of them are really very funny. Plus, Aragones did not do the cover art. But if you're one of those people who collect everything Aragones does, then this is a must-have. If you're just looking for some Sergio stuff on Star Wars, I'd recommend a comic that came out a couple of years ago called \\"Sergio Stomps Star Wars.\\" That should be enough for you; this book doesn't really add anything to that.<br /><br />As for the section on the translations of various alien phrases to be found in the Star Wars universe, it's strictly for pre-teens. Doubtful you'd spend more than a few minutes with it.<br /><br />What makes this book a winner, though, is the 43-page gem of an essay by Ben Burtt, the sound prodigy on the Star Wars movies, on the creation, inspiration, and various techniques for his award-winning effects. I wasn't expecting much from this piece, but it turned out to be well-written and completely engrossing. This essay alone (and I'm not aware of its being available from any other source) justifies the price of admission.<br /><br />Here is a typical excerpt:<br /><br />\\"Anyway, the sounds for the Tusken Raiders were inspired by the odd and often chilling donkey braying the crew heard in Tunisia during the location shooting. Donkeys were used to pack the tons of film equipment into the remote locations. Occasionally they would burst into barks and screeches during the shooting and be audible in the background of a take, thus ruining it. But their vocals echoing off the canyon walls proved weird and scary, so they were recorded and sent back to me. I added more to this collection back in the United States and incorporated some other elements of animal breathing and wheezing. Cut and blended together, the result was the speech of the Tusken Raiders.\\" [p.139]<br /><br />If you find this kind of stuff interesting, you're unlikely to rue purchasing this book.<br /><br />Regrettably, Burtt's essay was written just the Attack of the Clones came out, so that movie is not discussed.<br /><br />Also note that this is one of those smallish, subsized paperbacks.

Rather, in learning a language, having to decipher the definitions instead of having them handed to you makes a puzzle out of every word you don't know.  So, after staring at the definition, when you finally realize what the word means, you're unlikely to forget its definition, since you figured it out yourself.  I guess what I'm saying is that I found that when you yourself solve a riddle, there's a greater chance that you'll remember it.  This is certainly not the case even with the best French-English dictionaries.<br />This is a compact dictionary, yet impressively complete.  Also, it's designed for learners of French (though not necessarily English-speakers), so the definitions, while completely in French, are crafted to be clear and user-friendly.<br />The binding is excellent and the whole thing has a sturdy feel to it.<br />Perhaps the thing I found the most useful was that for every definition, the word is used in an easy, readily-apprehended French sentence, making it supremely easy to guess the meaning in the event that the definition proper was nebulous.<br />I have two gripes:<br />1.  Bizarre particles found in your reading (like &quot;eu,&quot; for example) aren't listed in this book, the way most French-English dictionaries refer you back to the root verb.  So if you find something that you know is some odd conjugation of an irregular verb, this dictionary won't help you.<br />2.  There is, alas, a printer's error with the '99 edition:  Starting on page 359, the entire Introduction is reprinted upside down.  Unlikely this would ruin your fun, though.	2002-04-29
