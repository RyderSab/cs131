On her first day of school, because there are already two girls named Maria in the class, Mar&iacute;a's teacher introduces the new girl as Mary Lopez.  Mar&iacute;a Isabel, however, does not like the sound of the Anglo name, which sounds strange to her.  Mar&iacute;a Isabel Salazar L&oacute;pez is proud of her appellation, as she was named after much admired members of her family.  She knows that the teacher means no harm, but does not know how to tell her what she wants.  While reading Charlotte's Web, Mar&iacute;a Isabel realizes how her spider heroine conveyed her message and finds an ingenious way to tell her teacher and everyone else how she really feels.<br />Alma Flor Ada tells a beautiful story about dignity without preaching.  My only criticism is that, with other Latino and Latina students in her class, she could not have asked them to translate her desire to the teacher, or why Mar&iacute;a Isabel was not in a bilingual class.  The story's central theme, though, is very real; this story is a gem and a great way to brush up on one's Spanish.	2004-01-04

Especially pernicious is the fact that violence is often presented as an acceptable means to solving problems, as this book makes clear multiple times.  Even worse, the perpetrators rarely have to deal with the consequences of their violent actions.  Col. Grossman points out that the perpetrators of the Jonesboro and Paducah tragedies similarly did not realize what their actions would bring.  Video games take the problem of violence to a new level by actually rewarding the use of violent means.<br />The book cites the preliminary results of the National Television Violence Study, an important longitudinal research project; it is hoped that a future edition of this book will address this critical study more thoroughly.<br />The Southern Poverty Law Center recently addressed the problem of violence in children's programs and toys; the Center's findings concur with those of Col. Grossman.<br />Most important, this book provides appendices listing the addresses of media executives, video game producers, and toy manufacturers.  Finally, the reader can turn to the list of media literacy and violence prevention organizations for more information.<br />All in all, it's a short book with an extremely important message.	2004-01-04

An autobiography that embodies this quality is bound to appeal to children, especially as Mr. de Paola relates this slice-of-life story from the perspective of a young boy growing up.  In this installment of the 26 Fairmount Avenue series, Tomie recounts the arrival of his new baby sister, Maureen; to this day, he is extremely close to his younger sibling.  The book, with de Paola's customary gentle wit, provides young readers and writers with an admirable example of the art of autobiography.  The author's charming illustrations complement the lyrical text.	2004-01-04

Therefore, I expect anything that bears the great Theodor Seuss Geisel's name to be of high quality.  The original cartoon version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the one narrated by Boris Karloff, is an example.  The recent movies, The Grinch and Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat, are not.  The unfortunate authors of this book were building on a movie that in itself is a travesty; they should not have undertaken this most unfortunate project.<br />My daughter wanted to read the book, and I would rather she read a book than watch TV, even if the quality of the former mirrors the lack of that of the latter. First, this book bears little resemblance to The Cat in the Hat and The Cat in the Hat Comes Back; even the few quoted lines of Dr. Seuss's poetry seem stilted and out of place.  The characters, nearly every one of them, are highly dislikable; like this retelling, they offer barely a redeeming quality.  The story is told from the point of view of Conrad, the boy who with his sister, Sally, is stuck in the house on a dull, rainy day.  Conrad could have written the story himself - the narration is pretentious and trite.  While the original books were written more than four decades ago, their stories could have taken place yesterday.  In this latest incarnation, the book's references to wide-screen TVs, Game Boys, and the like will seem laughingly out of date a mere five years from now!<br />The purveyors of the crass commercialization of Dr. Seuss's good name should be ashamed of themselves.  I recommend readers to stick with magic of Dr. Seuss's poetry, which has inspired generations of people of all ages.  This truly is a book you can put down.	2003-12-06

The A300 is now admired on every continent.  Some two decades, Airbus proposed another twin-engine design, this time a single-aisle aircraft, which would compete against Boeing 727 and 737, the best selling jet airliners of all time; again, people were sceptical of the plane's ability to sell.  The A320 family of airliners (which includes the short-body A319 and stretched A321, along with the scaled-down A318) has now sold over 1,000 airframes, bestowing on Airbus as the world's number one seller of airliners.<br />Tim Lamming and Robert Hewson's book contains a wealth of detail about the development of the A320, touching on its stablemates, the A319, A321, and A318. Technical specifications also abound. Photo captions are detailed and informative. My only complaint with this book, and others in Airlife Airliners series, is the lack of interior photographs: two flight deck pictures, economy class cabin view, and picture of the rear galley.  I really would have likes some views taken from inside the aircraft, especially of the wing flaps upon landing.<br />Between the time the book was published and the writing of this review, a great deal has happened, and even more airlines have purchased or leased this increasingly popular aircraft, most notably jetBlue.  Nevertheless, the book is up to date and thorough, offering the aviation enthusiast a good look at the overlooked classic that put Airbus on the map.	2003-12-06

The Saunders-Roe Princess and its proposed jet-powered successor certainly deserved mention, as did the Vought-Sikorsky VS-44A, of which a beautifully restored example resides at the New England Air Museum.  Also lacking are the many Soviet Beriev amphibians, along with the highly unusual Soviet Ekranoplan designs, aircraft that float on a cushion of air.

They were the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, and the Vickers VC-10.  They were not the first jetliners, however; that distinction goes to the De Havilland DH.106 Comet, Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle, and Tupolev Tu-104. Not included in this volume are the long-range Convair CV990 and Ilyushin Il-62 or the medium-range Convair CV880, Hawker-Siddeley Trident, and BAC-111.  Nevertheless, the author's choice of airliners offers interesting comparisons, especially as the Boeing and Vickers products have had long, illustrious careers as tankers.<br />The 707 is presented - along with its sister designs, the 717 (KC-135) and the 720 - both in military and civilian guises, though for some reason the military versions are presented first.  There is also an amusing story about the 707 in early Qantas service, which was a joy to read.<br />The DC-8 is presented, in all its variants and subvariants, including the Super 70s, DC-9-60 series aircraft that were re-engined with modern CFM-56 turbofans. The DC-8-40 bears the distinction of being the first turbofan-powered airliner, as well as the first airliner to break the sound barrier.<br />The VC-10 did not sell in the numbers that the 707 and DC-8 can boast, but this airliner was the favorite of the three among many pilots and passengers alike.<br />Mr. Wilson precedes each chapter with a historical overview of the manufacturer's heritage, offering a context for the design discussed.  He also provides charts for each airliner, covering original delivery customers and major variants.  A final chapter covers how the three types were &quot;shrinking the world&quot; and their roles in aviation today.  Lacking are photographs of the flight decks and interiors; they would have provided a glimpse of the era in which they carried passengers.  I would have also like to have seen a list of preserved examples of the three jetliners on display in museums.  Nevertheless, this fine book presents a highly readable history of a period of aviation slipping ever further into the past.have seen a list of preserved examples of the three jetliners on display in museums.

They were the De Havilland DH.106 Trident, Vickers Viscount, and BAC/Aerospatiale Concorde.  Two other pioneers were Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle, Tupolev Tu-104, and BAC-111; I would love to see these three treated together in another volume.<br />The Comet was the first production jet airliner, and the plane paid a heavy price for that distinction.  Although De Havilland took strong precautions in designing a pressurized airliner that would fly higher and faster than anything before, the concept of metal fatigue was not well understood.  Several well-publicized crashes doomed the success of the Comet; when the redesigned Comet 4 emerged, the British airliner was easily outclassed by the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, both of which benefited from what was learned from the Comet.<br />The Viscount was the world's first turboprop airliner. The difference between the new turbine and previous piston engine was readily apparent and appreciated among passengers; the Viscount heralded a new standard of comfort and reliability in short- to medium-range air travel.  Vickers sold 444 airframes, making it the most successful British airliner ever.  The plane's engines themselves are an aviation classic; the superb Rolls-Royce Dart went on to power the Fokker F-27, Handley-Page Dart Herald, and Hawker-Siddeley HS.748 among other aircraft.<br />The Concorde speaks for itself.  Though the Tupolev Tu-144 preceded Concorde, the Anglo-French airliner remains the only successful supersonic transport.  With its recent 2003 retirement, the Concorde has attained somewhat of a cult status.<br />Mr. Stewart has presented three very different British designs, each it its own way a pioneer.  Each section includes a detailed production list, data on types and subtypes, and detailed sketches.  This book is a highly worthy addition to any commercial aviation enthusiast's bookshelf.	2003-12-06

Looking through this beautiful book, you will be struck by how many of these pictures seem familiar; it was Mr. Cross's tenure at Airfix in the 1960s and 1970s that helped make him famous.  Presented is a fine representative selection of Cross's work, much of which graced the boxes of Airfix kits.  What makes this book particularly enjoyable is the inclusion of the artist's own commentary throughout.<br />I must point out that Mr. Cross is better known as a maritime artist; for the &quot;other half&quot; of his work, you will have to turn elsewhere.

Also noteworthy is that practically all of the airlines depicted have either folded or were merged with larger carriers. Had this book been published a few years later, I am sure Pan Am and Eastern would have been included as well.<br />Most of the pictures are of decent quality, though a few do spread onto two pages.

Mr. Veronico does an admirable job showing the configurations unique to each airline customer, and he includes information on secondary operators of the type.<br />Mr. Veronico's text is both enjoyable and informative, covering the development of the mighty Strat, along with narratives of the aircraft in airline service.  This technologically advanced (for its time) airliner, unfortunately, had more than its share of trouble; the author describes the untimely endings of these ill-fated birds, including Captain Richard Ogg's heroic water landing of Clipper 953, Clipper Sovereign of the Skies.  Detailed charts at the end of the book present the serial numbers and construction IDs of all the Stratocruisers by major carrier, along with individual histories of each and every Stratocruiser built.<br />I have yet to find more information on a particular aircraft in a single volume; Mr. Veronico truly outdid himself here.

In this book, authors Curtis Stringfellow and Peter Bowers do an admirable job of presenting this graceful bird, both civil and military variants, in considerable detail.<br /><br />The authors describe each variant - the Army C-69; the civilian 049, 749, 1049, and 1649 Starliner; and military Super Constellations - in considerable detail.  The book opens with an overview of passenger air transport after World War I, showing the progress made by notabale designs.  The second introduction is a survey of the Lockheed Corporation, which (like Boeing) owes its beginnings to seaplanes.  The third machine, the Model S-1, however, is a supremely elegant sport biplane designed by Jack Northrop (who would later design the DC-1,-2, and -3). The beautiful steamlined shape that would become the hallmark of Lockheed airliners, especially the Constellation series, is evident in this 1920 photograph.  From there, the authors progresss to the design of the Constellation, which had its roots in the proposed (but not built) Model 44 Excalibur.  (For the different proposed noses of the full-size Constellation, the reader will have to turn to Jim Winchester's book, and then back to this one, as the latter does not discuss the Excalibur.)  For each major type, Stringfellow and Bowers show the flight decks and interiors, and how they progressed along with the technological advancements in each new model of the Constellation.  Charts outlining subtypes and the number each airline ordered are given.  There is also a wealth of interesting picture material for us illustration junkies.  They cover Constellation operations with major and second-tier operators on every continent.  Reference sections detail accidents and incidents, surviving Constellations, major operators, and civil registrations.  The publisher also provides an index, a feature lacking in the Airliner Tech series.

The selection includes many unusual types, such as the one-and-only TWA Fairchild C-82 Packet, Canadair C-4 Argonaut, Avro York, ATL-98 Carvair, and Curtiss C-46. The only aircraft of the era missing is the Avro/HS-748 - I would have love to seen a \\"Budgie\\" in early Dan-Air or BKS markings.  Seeing propliners and jets side by side presents a very interesting contrast.  Because this was the height of the Cold War, Soviet types were seldom photographed in the West; as a result, they are not well represented in this collection.  You will find an Aeroflot Tu-104 and Il-14, along with a LOT Ilyushin Il-18, however.  Most of the photos are of high quality, the lack of fading betraying their age.  Noteworthy are several very rare photos depict airliners that existed in a particular livery for only a few months.  Mr. Balch also deserves praise for his informative descriptions of each photograph, detailing where the picture was taken, previous owners of the aircraft, and the plane's ultimate fate.

For each picture, Mr. Morton also includes an annotation of the history of the airline, though only basic information on the aircraft itself.  Also missing is a table of contents or index; if you want to look up a particular airline or plane, you are on your own.<br />All in all, as an airliner buff, I enjoy looking at the pictures and find the book to be highly worthwhile.	2003-12-01

It gives no feeling of being dated.<br /><br />This book presents detailed photos of the undercarriage, wheel wells, engines (both turbojet and turbofan), and flight decks you are unlikely to encounter in most aviation books.  My only quibble is page 46, which discusses the 707-200, a \\"hot ship\\" delivered exclusively to Braniff, in which the short fuselage and wings of the 707-120 was mated to the Pratt & Whittney JT-4A turbojets of the -320 Intercontinental.  Two pictures do indeed depict a 707-227, but the caption mentions that the aircraft pictured, N7071, was delivered to Braniff in July 1959.  In fact, this aircraft crashed prior to delivery, making N7072 Braniff's first 707.  The bottom photo shows a Braniff 720-027, not a 707-227; that aircraft was equipped with the same Pratt & Whittney JT-3C turbojets of the 707-120 series.<br /><br />The color and black-and-white photos and illustrations are crisp and of good quality.  The author does a good job showing the differences among the various types and subtypes, both civil and military.  Several nice photos of aircraft under construction are presented, but for a detailed look at early proposed designs, you will need to consult Rene Francillon's 707: Pioneer Jetliner.  Diagrams outlining the interior of the AWACS versions are included, but as the book was published during the Cold War, these may not be complets.  At the end of the book, Mr. Lloyd presents kit reviews.  Some of these kits are still available, for others you will need to find one on eBay (the rare Airfix 707 \\"Air Force One\\" is not mentioned); the newer kits by AMT and Minicraft, of course, are not included.  Though this section is somewhat out of date, I still found it to be helpful in my selection of the Entex 1/100 scale kit over the Heller 1/72 model to represent the 707 in my collection.  The bibliography lists books on the Boeing 707 published prior to 1985; it is fairly comprehensive but omits Martin Caidin's classic mass-market paperback when American Airlines took delivery of its first 707s.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the 707, you would do well to puprchase this book.books on the Boeing 707 published prior to 1985; it is fairly comprehensive but omits Martin Caidin's classic mass-market paperback when American Airlines took delivery of its first 707s.

If the dramatic box top illustration encouraged you to dig a little deeper into your pocket and purchase that kit, you probably have Roy Cross to thank.  Some of these models became prized display pieces, others met an untimely fate at the mercy of a book of matches or firecrackers.<br />Just about every Airfix kit you remember, and several you may have forgotten, are presented.  The pictures brought back many fond memories, and the text gave me a fine overview of the history of the company and its kits.  Yes, there are better detailed and more modern kits available in hobby stores today, but the old-fashioned offerings of Airfix, heavy-handed rivet detail, thick canopies and all continue to hold a special place in the hearts of those of us who have been with this hobby for several decades.  My main critique concerns the repetitiveness of the book and its poor organization; the manuscript definitely could have used a helping hand of a good editor.  However, as with the kits themselves, Airfix aficionados like myself are willing to overlook such shortcomings.	2003-12-01

Presented are first-generation jets, turboprops, and propliners in schemes of the 1950s and 1960s.  The selection includes many unusual types, such as the Vickers Viking, Airspeed Ambassador, Curtiss C-46, Breguet 763, and DeHavilland Heron, to name a few. Because this was the height of the Cold War, Soviet types were seldom photographed in the West; this book does, however, include a rare shots of a Cubana Antonov An-12 and an Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-124, along with interesting photos of LOT and CSA Ilyushin Il-14s (plus a flight-deck shot of an Aeroflot example), Aeroflot/KLM Ilyushin Il-62 (something I never saw before), and two Misrair Antonov An-24s, and proboably the only photograph in existence of an Eastern DC-7 in the \\"hockey stick\\" livery.  I also have a soft spot for British airliners, and these are very well represented, thank you very much.  The only shortcoming is that the Douglas DC-8 is represented with but a single example.  All photos are of high quality, the lack of fading betraying their age.  Mr. Balch also deserves praise for his informative descriptions of each photograph, detailing where the picture was taken, previous owners of the aircraft, and the plane's ultimate fate.  Airline Nostalgia offers a quality collection of interesting illustrations (many of them very rare!) the airliner enthusiast is likely to look at again and again.	2003-12-01

The poems, though simple and easy to read, reflect on deep and personal thoughts; they are also wonderfully humorous.

Mr. Singfield accommodates nearly everyone's definition of a classic airliner; his criteria for inclusion are that the type must be out of production with at least one preserved survivor (air show circuit queen or museum piece) somewhere in the world.  Sadly, this precludes inclusion of such fascinating types as Handley-Page HP-42 Heracles, and De Havilland DH-91 Albatross, the latter in my mind being one of the most beautiful aircraft ever built. At least the author explains this up front in the introduction.  Similarly, we also no not get to see most of the wonderful old Clippers, such as the Martin M130, Sikorsky S-42, or Boeing 314 Clipper, but newly restored Vought-Sikorsky VS-44A is present in all its glory.<br />Mr. Singfield includes the venerable classics such as the DC-3, Lockheed Constellation, De Havilland DH-106 Comet, and Boeing 707, but the book's greatest strength lies in its inclusion of less well-known types, particulary old Soviet types that are only recently accessible to Western observers. This book helped me finally distinguish between the Ilyushin Il-12 and Il-14 and the Antonov An-8, An-10, and An-12.  The author also points out how the Antonov An-8's design predated the mighty Lockheed Hercules. And speaking of old Soviet airliners, page 138 has a wonderful and highly historic 1956 picture of Tupolev Tu-104A CCCP-L5445 visiting Idlewild airport in 1956, the first production airliner to visit New York City (Boeings Dash-80 did make a visit earlier), predating BOAC's first London to New York Comet flight by some two years!<br />&quot;I'm sure you will find ... other [airliners] that qualify for inclusion by age, scarcity, or interest,&quot; writes the author.  Indeed I did: the McDonnell-Douglas DC-8 series -60 and -70, oldies but goodies widely praised for their durability and excellent economics. The 737-100 and -200 are included but not the 727 series, which enjoyed one of the longest production runs of any airliner until eclipsed by the 737 and A320 series. The early model 747s are there, but the DC-10 and Lockheed L1011 are not, though the latter two are rapidly disappearing from mainstream service. However, much to his credit, Mr. Singfield did include the Concorde, which with its recent (2003) retirement has become a cult symbol even among persons with no further interest in airliners.<br />All in all, this book has a lot to offer, and even a jaded aviation enthusiast who thinks he or she has seen it all will learn something new from this interesting book.-8 series -60 and -70, oldies but goodies widely praised for their durability and excellent economics.

This prophecy, set to occur \\"in the near future,\\" has not materialized; nevertheless, this theme continues to be rehashed, most notably by the Rev. Patrick Buchanan in \\"Death of the West.\\"<br />Mr. Raspail argues that multiculturalism and multiracialism have undermined European (White) culture and society.  Freakish characters make such comments as, \\"There's not one of you proud of his skin, and all that it stands for...\\" and \\"Already they saw it their mission to guide the flock's first steps on Western soil. One would empty out all our hospital beds so that cholera-ridden and leprous wretches could sprawl between the clean white sheets.  Another would cram our brightest, cheeriest nurseries full of monster children.

Make no mistake; Paved with Good Intentions is social Darwinism (i.e., eugenics) at its worst.  Mr. Taylor argues that &quot;welfare mothers&quot; should accept a five-year implantable contraceptive device in return for government assistance.  At least that would be easier to promote than &quot;forced abortion&quot; on those whom society deems &quot;less fit.&quot;<br />Who is Jared Taylor?

However, this time, the narrator remains anonymous but is not forgotten.  Without undue melodrama, she tells how part of her family is about to be sold off; the time is now or never to escape, which she and part of her family does. Though the slaves are fleeing their cruel owners, the book focuses on the good, kind people along the underground railroad who help the runaways find safety in Canada. Noteworthy are the secret codes the fleeing slaves and their protectors used, such as the owl hoot, lantern, and log cabin quilt patterns.  The latter idea is drawn from \\"Hidden in Plain View,\\" an adult book that unlocks much of the secret communication that enabled thousands of slaves find safety and freedom.  (I recommend \\"Hidden in Plain View\\" highly.) The illustrations are breathtaking; I particularly like the geese flying north when the family reaches a northern US church (flying geese is another quilt code pattern).  This book should be read with \\"Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt\\" and \\"Follow the Drinking Gourd.\\"  The story of the Underground Railroad is a story of how conscientious good can overcome evil.  \\"Under the Quilt of Night\\" is a story that needs to be told and remembered	2002-08-24

It is a story of day laborers from Mexico; moreover, it describes how the whole family pulls together to make ends meet (a theme that Francisco Jimenez beautifully explores in \\"The Circuit/Cajas de Carton). Though it's a simple story, there are several surprise twists. As with her other stories, Eve Bunting tells this one with her characteristic sensitivity without indulging in, you know, the mushy stuff.

Dr. Krashen gives a brief, but detailed, overview of theory before going into what a foreign- or second-language program should encompass.  Finally, the author goes over issues in foreign language education, that is the conditions classroom teachers are likely to face in real life, such as a lack of opportunity to practice and communicate native speakers.<br />As in &quot;The Natural Approach,&quot; which I recommend as a supplement to this short volume, Dr. Krashen urges teachers of students, elementary through adult, to provide as much exposure to the target language (&quot;Comprehensible Input&quot;) as possible, definitely a commonsense and proven approach I plan to use with my elementary-school and adult ESL students in the future.	2001-12-30

And so I did.  With confidence, I can say that this is the most detailed and insightful book on the Boeing 707 I have read.  The depth of detail is breathtaking.<br />Most interesting is Rene Francillon's description of the many designs Boeing engineers conceived before building the prototype, the famous Dash-80.  Early flights of this pioneering jetliner are described; I only wish the author had spent more time describing the flight in which Tex Johnson executed a Dutch roll, as that story always makes a fascinating read.  Nevertheless, though I had read a great deal about the subject, this book showed me how much I still could learn.<br />Mr. Francillon then goes into detail of every 707 variant, commercial, government, and military.  One really appreciates both the versitality of the 707 design and the ingenuity of the Boeing marketing team (the author holds a PhD in aviation economics).  The text is highly readable and enjoyable, except for the one occasion when Mr. Francillon injected his political views vis-a-vis the destruction of MEA 707s and 720s at Beirut.  I would have also loved to have seen a box on the Shanghai Y-10, a most unusual Chinese attempt to build a long-range jet airliner, using spare engine pylons and engines from the 707-3J6s it ordered in the 1970s.<br />The appendices at the end of the book give a detailed rundown on performance statistics, how many 707s and 720s each operator ordered, first flights and records, and hull losses.  The only thing missing was a list of specimens preserved as museum pieces or &quot;gate keepers,&quot; of which there are a handful - here's a recommendation for a second edition, which this otherwise outstanding book should see.	2001-12-29

For centuries sailors have relied on the constellations of heavenly lanterns to guide their way.  In crisp, vivid prose, Marian Wright Edelman tells us about the heroes who provided beacons of hope and inspiration, helping her find her way through the many moral dillemas of life and stay on course.<br />What is interesting is the sheer variety of backgrounds Dr. Edelman's heroes have. Nevertheless, they all share the author's passion for human rights and social justice.  As a bonus, Dr. Edelman gives a brief history of the civil rights era, a nice complement to two other fine books on that fascinating topic, Taylor Branch's &quot;Parting the Waters&quot; and David Halberstam's &quot;The Children.&quot;<br />This book is much more a memoir.  It is a call of action and an inspiration for all of us to act for the common good, to serve the community.  It is up to the current generations to act as a positive role model for the next, much as Dr. Edelman's mentors did for her.<br />Mentors, lanterns, are important at all times, during the economic boom of the late 1990s, when this book was written, as well as in the troubled initial years of the 21st century.

The design is an extraordinarly efficient and versatile one: it is economical on both short hops and major transcontinental voyages.<br />Philip Birtles's book contains a wealth of detail about the development of the 767, touching on two of its Boeing stablemates, the 757 and 777.  Technical specifications also abound, along with a photographic walk around a Boeing 767-300ER at Gatwick.  Photo captions are detailed and informative.  My only complaint is the lack of interior photographs:  two cockpit pictures (not bad), an old Business Class view, and a sketch of the newer 777-style interior.<br />Between the time the book was published and the writing of this review, a great deal has happened, particularly in regard to the production of the latest variant, the 767-400.  I hope that Mr. Birtles updates this text soon.  With that, like the airplane namesake, this book will stand the test of time.	2001-12-21

This is also a book for adults (parents, educators, and religious and community leaders) to read, to live a life of principles and a desire to somehow make the world a better place - in short, to serve as the strong, positive role model that so many of our children have had to do without.<br />The book is also an indictment on how American society and political leadership do a great job at paying lip service to the needs of children but fails miserably in their actions.  Complaining, however, is not enough; if children are to grow up to be conscientious and caring citizens, adults must set a good example.<br />It's a small book with a big heart and a great message.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who cares about children and social justice in general.	2001-12-20

I would add one more nickname: \\"the Walt Whitman of Harlem.\\" Langston Hughes, as other reviewers have stated, was also very much a poet of the people, not just African American but all Americans. Langston Hughes's poetry sheds a powerful light on the Black experience in all its complexities, from every perspective. This book is \\"must reading\\" for anyone wanting to learn more about the people and cultures of the United States, and its debt to people of African descent.<br /><br />Included in this masterful anthology are essays on the life of Langston Hughes and his poetry. The primary poems are divided by decades; other work is included in three appendices. The first appendix comprises poems circulated by the Associated Negro Press but were never part of the general canon. The second appendix contains poetry for children, though readers interested in this area will want to acquire a copy of Hughes's \\"Black Misery.\\" The third appendix includes additional poems attributed to Langston Hughes and whos authenticity has been confirmed since the first edition of the \\"Collected Poems of Langston Hughes.\\"<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is not with its contents but the flimsy soft cover. A more substantial cover is a necessity, for this is a book that I, like so many other people, turn to over and over again.<br /><br />It is easy to take for granted how much of American culture has its roots in African-American culture, especially literature and music. If you are looking for an example of this notion, you have come to the right place. Langston Hughes's poetry is steeped in Jazz rhythms and social consciousness; it is, at the same time, an assertion of black civil rights and an astute observation of black (and, by extension, American) cultural awareness. In short, it is \\"must reading\\" for anyone with an interest in any of these areas.It's a big book, certainly not something one can devour in a single sitting. Then, again, one wouldn't want to; this is a collection of poems to savor and reflect upon.book, certainly not something one can devour in a single sitting.

Zarafa is the main character - not a king, conqueror or superhero, but a giraffe. As we follow this giraffe from the depths of Africa to cosmopolitan Paris, we get to know her as intimately as any human travel companion. Along the way, we learn about French and Egyptian history, Arabic customs and Parisian ways, geography, exploration and many other interesting tidbits. The book's only shortcoming is its sentimentality, but this is not of the heavy-handed Disney variety and does not detract from a most engaging, interesting, and enjoyable journey.	2001-07-26

Do you need a book that will delight children from 5 to 13? &quot;Say Hola! to Spanish&quot; did exactly that for my students, from kindergarten through grade 8 - er, ocho. Children of all ages (and that includes this middle-aged teacher of Spanish) will delight to the likes of the following: &quot;Your hair is your pelo, your nose is nariz. Your grandmother's pelo is probably gris.&quot; &quot;Bread is called pan and cheeses are quesos. That's what we eat, but perros eat huesos.&quot; Learning foreign words could not be more fun!	2001-07-25

If you are a civil aviation buff, this book has a wealth of detail on an entirely revised version of the venerable 747, the series -400, first flown in 1989.  (Though nearly a quarter century later, some examples have been retired, the prototype is still flying with Delta.)  The book contains a wealth of information on the design, construction, and operation of all versions of the -400, both outside and inside the aircraft (including the cockpit).  Early operators of the series -400 are surveyed, and a history of the type is presented; it is not terribly strong on technical details, however. Please note: as this book chronicles the early history, so most of the aircraft featured are passenger planes; in later years, most variants were built as freighters, and some passenger-carrying models were converted to that role, as well.  I find myself looking through this book over and over!	2001-07-25

Whether you are interested in toy vehicles or real buses, this book offers a feast for the eyes. An astounding array of model buses from some 20 nations - diecast, plastic, tin-plate, and cardboard - awaits you; the material is extremely captivating. But beware, if you do not already collect model buses, you may find yourself doing so after perusing this book. Also included are many antique and rare models one doesn't see all the time. Granted, not every model is included and the survey could be a little stronger regarding models from the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, this book has a lot to offer and I heartily recommend it to anyone with more than a passing interest in buses.	2001-07-25

Susan Middleton Elya has done it again! &quot;Say Hola! to Spanish&quot; was delight to read - aloud; &quot;Say Hola to Spanish, Otra Vez&quot; does not disappoint! On the contrary, students from kindergarten all the way through grade 8 delighted in Ms. Elya's catchy rhymes and plays on words. If you loved &quot;Say Hola! to Spanish&quot; the first time around, &quot;Otra Vez&quot; delivers... again and again!	2001-07-25

More than that, the authors take us on a journey of how the 747 came to be and where it is today. Each series and variant is surveyed; the information is concise and accurate. Technical and historical content are well balanced.  While this book may not be the visual feast laid out before us in the Airliner Color History series, this book is highly engaging and well worthwhile to any airliner aficianado, with plenty of worthwhile, solid information.	2001-07-25

While this title does have some interesting photos, the number of inaccuracies and gross errors made me cringe. For example, the number of windows on the upper deck (three vs. ten) is not the way to tell a series -100 from a -200 aircraft; while this is a common misconception, an aviation writer should know better. As for the photo captions, these range from banal, with phrases such as &quot;shows to good advantage&quot; used many times, to entirely fictitious: a photo showing a KLM 747 surrounded by KLM servicing vehicles and modern jetways is not &quot;somewhere in the Middle East&quot; but Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, as anyone with at least some familiarity with this major gateway would know. My recommendation: type &quot;Boeing 747&quot; in Amazon's search engine; all the in-print titles there are highly worthwhile.	2001-07-24
