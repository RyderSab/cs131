The two girls meet in London after the British War takes place, and become friends, though in character they are very opposite one another. Ellie a brunette, is loving, kind, and has a sparkling smile. Yet Bonnie who is beautiful and very spoiled by her doting parents, is deceptive in many ways. Ellie and Bonny were both separated from their parents during the war as evacuees. When the two finally meet, the hardship of war has passed, and they make a life together in the theatre.  <br /> <br />As their friendship continues on though, there is a lot of lies and deception which Ellie sometimes doesn't know if she will stand for time and time again with Bonnie. Yet, she always abides by her wishes, no matter how painful they are to herself.  <br /> <br />Too bad Lesley Pearse is not more of a well-known author here in the U.S. Her books should not be missed by avid readers and I highly recommend them.	2005-09-14

Dulcie Taylor, and May her younger sister were raised in an orphanage by nuns who were as cruel as it gets. They were sent there from the time they were very young because their father murdered their mother and was sent to prison.  <br /> <br />Dulcie was the more sensitive sister, and May the more charming one, knew how to work the nuns to get her way. When they were sent to Austrailia to another orphanage, knowing it would be better there, it was anything but that. The nuns worked the girls like slaves, and the least little incidents were very severely punished. May was the favored one, but there were secrets there no one knew about until much later. <br /> <br />Dulcie found jobs much later when she was old enough to leave the orphanage. She was treated shamefully in her first job as servant to the Masters, and finally after about 2 years could stand it no longer. From there she found a loving family who loved her like one of their daughters. It was at that time she met Ross, a boy who also grew up in an orphanage and was very embittered by that. The two of them got married eventually, but it was not a good thing.  <br /> <br />Dulcie connects with where May is when a letter arrives. Feeling she must find her sister, she leaves for Sydney, and finds that May has turned to a life of prostitution and stealing, which she had done all along. And another shocking thing was that May had had a baby she couldn't take care of. So when Dulcie finds the terrible state of neglect the child, Noel, was in, she manages to take him into her care. The child's father Rudie gets custody of Noel, and eventually, he and Dulcie fall in love and the chips will fall where they may there. <br /> <br />The book is a bit lengthy and has many details. It is impossible to go into each one of them here, so I have mainly summarized the story. It is very worthwhile reading, and Pearse is one of the best!	2005-08-12

It is too bad that Lesley Pearse's books are not over here in bookstores that frequently. She is perhaps, the best author I have ever read before out of all the books I've reviewed here. She writes with more depth and meaning than any other author I've known. <br /> <br />In this saga, Till We Meet Again, is written about two women who were best friends as young girls. Their lives parallel one anothers in that they both grew up in VERY dysfunctional homes.  <br /> <br />For Beth Powell, it was her hateful father who beat on her mother and the kids as they grew up, and they all lived in fear of him. <br /> <br />For Susan Wright, it was a life of servitude to first her mother, and then her father. Her brother Martin hated her terribly, and when their father passed away, her dad left the family wealth to Martin, and not her, after all of her slavery. Susan became a very very angry person, especially moreso after getting losing her little daughter to meningitis when no doctor cared enough to care for her promptly. It was at that point when she turned to killing people as a way of fighting back. And for a long time, she wasn't caught until she shot the doctor and secretary at the clinic who she felt responsible for her daughter's death. At that point she was caught, and kept in jail. <br /> <br />Beth Powell, who had become a lawyer crossed paths with Susan again 29 years later, and was going to act as her defense lawyer. Their friendship endured, even though the evidence Susan is getting stronger.  <br /> <br />As the story moves on, Susan reveals more shocking facts about her past, as does Beth. And there will be a happy ending for only one of them.	2005-07-28

Adele is overcome with shock, and fears for her life, because her mother hates her, and loves Pamela. Her mother's wrath will be horrible, and Adele knows she'll be even more hated now than already. And sure enough, this is what happens. <br /> <br />Her mother tries to kill Adele, and lives in a drunken stupor. Later Adele gets sent away to an orphanage where she is sexually abused by Mr. Makepeace, the male owner of the group home. Fearing for her life once again, she runs away to her grandmother's home, knowing where she lives, but has a long way to travel there on foot. By the time she reaches Honor, her cantankerous grandma's house, she is very very ill, and collapses on the front porch when she gets there. Her granmother, not happy at all about meeting her granddaughter, begrudgingly nurses her back to health. It is at some point though, that the old lady's heart gives in, and the two become very close. Honor adopts Adele, taking her into her legal guardianship, severing all ties with her mother who is in a mental hospital. <br /> <br />The story moves on, Adele grows up, and becomes a nurse, working very hard. She meets her first love, but then there is the impending war, so he is sent away. At some point, her mother returns, and then the whole plot of the story changes, as seeking forgiveness isn't easy, and there are more terrible secrets in the past that will shock everyone with the return of Rose in the picture.	2005-07-23

Her sister Katie, who has been sickly her entire life has had to have one procedure after another. But she wouldn't have been able to stay alive as long as she did without Anna's help, her younger sister who was conceived for that very reason. Since Jesse was no match for Kate in any way for blood or bone marrow, Sara and Brian, the parents created their special plan to genetically plan Anna. That way, conceived inside a petri dish, she could be Katie's match, and not once, but many times over. <br /> <br />Anna feels she is nothing but a guinea pig for Katie, and is very weary of the whole situation. Especially when Katie will experience renal failure finally, and needs a kidney transplant from her sister of course. But here is where Anna draws the line. Seeking out a lawyer, she sues her parents for rights to make up her own mind on her medical care. This causes a lot of tension within the whole family through this whole book. Campbell, the lawyer, and Julia, her guardian ad litem, try to help all they can. As time goes on, Katie will fail more and more, and Sara, Anna's mom, keeps pressuring Anna to change her mind. But on the other hand, poor Katie just wants to let go. <br /> <br />They battle on through court, and what's in the end, well, I won't tell of course. But it is very sad indeed.

I enjoyed yet another book by Lorna Landvik. This one was all about two sisters that were fraternal twins. Ann was the one who was always in her sister Geneva's shadow, as Geneva turned out to be the BIG STAR on broadway. Poor Ann, married, had a son with down-syndrome. When she and her husband needed a break for a vacation to Italy for a month, she asks Geneva to babysit with Rich. Of course, reluctantly Geneva agrees, and sets out from New York to Minnesota to watch over Rich while they're gone. It was a welcome change in a sense that Geneva had just been dumped yet again by her star boyfriend Trevor, also a big actor.  <br /> <br />Of course, Rich took right to his Aunt Gennie very nicely. But Geneva, not being used to kids at all, especially special needs kids like Rich, it was very difficult at first until she learned his ways. Geneva becomes friends with Barbara, the next door neighbor who helps with Rich, as she has a disabled son, Conrad, herself. He has cerebal palsy and is a fragile kid. He and Rich have been the best of friends for years.  <br /> <br />Geneva also meets James, the mailman, but also Barb's friend and he is divorced. He and Geneva strike it off right away, and seemingly fall in love. But Trevor, still wants Geneva back, and she isn't sure in this part of the book. The conclusion on this segment becomes clear at the ending.  <br /> <br />The Great Mysterious though, was entitled that way because of the fact that Geneva and Ann made up a scrapbook many years, named that. It was named that because it had questions and answers to life's biggest questions, and was quite a unique record over the years as the kids in their family added to it, and adults tried to provide the answers. I thought this was a great part of the book, and it tied the story together when it came to life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.	2005-05-30

(in Atlanta that is), Jessie lives a conventional life with her psychiatrist husband, Hugh. She has always loved Hugh of course, but things change deeply when she goes to her mother in South Carolina. It is there she falls deeply in love with Brother Thomas, a monk, who of course is committed to his celibacy, and cannot allow for anything to happen. Before he became a monk though, he was an attorney, and had a wife and child, whom he lost in a terrible tragedy. Whit, as his real name is, really went to become a monk, only because he needed an escape route from all of his terrible grief. When he meets Jessie though, it is also love at first sight, and the two must keep their feelings a big dark secret.  <br /> <br />They are in a terrible predicament. Is Jessie supposed to give up 20 years of marriage to Hugh, and how about Brother Thomas? Will he be able to turn away from his new religious commitments as a monk? <br /> <br />The truth gradually leaks out of course, and Hugh gets hurt. But I can't tell any further from here. You'll need to read for yourself and see what happens. The end is surprising!	2005-05-24

For Khaled Hosseini's first book, you can see that he has raw talent for writing. I have never read anything quite so good all the way through it in all of the books I've reviewed on here. <br /> <br />This story takes place in Aghanistan where two boys, Amir who is narrator of the story, and Hassan his friend. One father, Amir's father, is rich and Hassan and his father Ali are servants to them in their beautiful mansion. Amir is quite a bookworm, and Hassan who has a hare-lip and gets poked fun at often, is the illiterate one who stays at home helping with chores. <br /> <br />Baba, of whom Amir calls his father, loves Hassan a lot more than he does his own son. It seems that Amir can never quite please his father enough, and that no matter what Hassan does, his father is overjoyed. Of course, we won't understand why until you read later in the book what happens-and I don't want to give that away. <br /> <br />Anyhow to move on here, the boys love flying kites and capturing them. When there is a tournament for the kit event, Amir wins bigtime, and for once he makes his father proud momentarily anyway. But after this event happens, the boy who is a real bully, Assef, cruelly tackles Hassan in the corner and does a very very hideous thing to him. It was VERY bad, and Amir who observes this, doesn't step in and try even helping his close friend. Instead he walks off scared of Assef himself, leaving Hassan to fend for himself. This scene changes the WHOLE picture, and Amir just cannot bear to look at Hassan afterwords, he is carrying such horrible guilt. It really isn't too long before this causes Hassan and his father to leave. It totally breaks Baba's heart, and Amir's too in his own way. His father blames him for what has happened, even though Amir never directly told him. <br /> <br />After the ramifications in the Middle East, Amir and Baba his father will travel to America to live. His father is suddenly very poor, and takes a job pumping gas long hours, and selling flea market items on the weekend with Amir trying to make ends meet. It is at the flea market after many weeks that Amir meets his first and only love Soraya, and the two will marry eventually. Baba comes down with lung cancer and refuses treatment, so after Amir marries, Baba dies shortly after.  <br /> <br />Amir develops quite a writing career, and travels to Afghanistan shortly after his first novel comes out.

I've always enjoy Fielding's work, and I liked this book maybe not quite as much as the others she has written. It focuses on a prosecuting attorney, Jess who is having many problems in her life concerning her mother who has been missing for several years, a stalker waiting to attack, and a client who ends up killed.  <br /> <br />In the story, Jess has many moments of terrible panic attacks. And she has a lot of trouble keeping herself together. Her ex-husband's client Rick Fergerson, is trouble and not in jail where he should be. He stalks Jess everywhere, and is believed to be the one who killed Connie, Jess's client who was raped and beaten. When Connie appears missing, the first suspect of course is Rick, but there is not enough evidence in court yet to convict him. <br /> <br />In another of her situations, her brother-in-law Barry can't stand Jess and seems to make trouble for her as well. When Jess starts receiving threats by the mail, and break-ins at her apartment, she also believes her brother-in-law has a hand in it. This causes problems between she and her sister Maureen. <br /> <br />Then Jess also meets a shoe salesman who seems to like her very much, Adam. She isn't sure that with all the things happening to her, that she can really trust Adam. He seems to be a mystery himself, and has secrets from the past. <br /> <br />The book builds up slowly until the last portion. It is hard to write a great review on it, as there are so many situations happening at once. Jess finally resolves her past eventually about what happened to her mother so many years ago. She isn't able to go on with things until then, as it might have everything to do who is stalking her now-and of course I won't say. <br /> <br />All in all, it was worth reading.	2005-04-09

It just happened that within the time-frame of a year, he became the owner of Ford County's only newspaper. The paper was always famous for its well-crafted obituaries.

This story was based on a true story that happened back in the year 1786. It took place in Austrailia. <br /> <br />Mary Broad was only 18 years of age, when in terrible poverty, she steals a silk hat. For that small crime, she was sentenced to death as it says in the beginning of the book. However, at the last minute she gets a break from hanging, and is instead, sentenced to 7 years of transportation. The fate though, is almost as horrifying as death, in that these prisoners in transportation live in VERY deplorable conditions. <br /> <br />The only thing Mary can do is have courage and be determined to live one day to the next. And that is exactly what she does, and is of lots of help and a friend to her fellow prisoners.  <br /> <br />Throughout the story, there is birth of children, escape, and death.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend the book.	2005-03-24

I enjoyed this book once I really got past the first 50 pages or so. It is one of those stories that takes its time building. <br /> <br />The story has Reuben as the narrator, the middle child of the family. He has an older brother Davy, and younger sister Suede. <br />They live with their father who is a struggling janitor in the school, and a widower.  <br /> <br />When two big boys that are trouble threaten their younger sister's life one evening, Davy shoots the two boys when they next come to burglarize their house with malicious intent again. <br />He kills both boys, and so therefore, is found guilty of murder. <br />After being locked away in jail, he finds an escape and becomes a fugitive. He is never to be found that easily, even when the FBI comes after him.  <br /> <br />The family sets out to try and find Davy, and first of all, they go to a friend's home who has seen Davy since he broke out of jail. From there, they travel through Minnesota, and find a woman who takes them into her home. Davy is suspected to be in that area. And he is. Reuben discovers a man on a horse one day, and sees that it is indeed Davy. But he keeps this a secret, as the feds have caught up with him, but he is not recognized as he has radically changed his appearance.  <br /> <br />The story builds more from this point forward. I don't dare say anymore as to ruin the book fro future readers, but it gets really good from there on. A side plot is that this Roxann that takes the family in is having a budding romance with the father. The two may just wind up together.	2005-03-13

This is the first I have ever read of Courtenay's writing, and I did enjoy the story all the way through. <br /> <br />It takes place in Africa, back in 1939. A boy Peekay, as he was later called was an english child. The story begins with Peekay being taken from his dear nanny, as his mother was unable to care for him, and he was sent to a boarding school. There he was considered not \\"one of them,\\" the African's that is, so he was bullied almost to death, and picked on for everything. After about 2 years there, he was sent back home to his mother who had recovered. Before that, during the trip home, he meets a friend, Hoppy, who cares for the boy and was like his big brother during the whole trip. Hoppy was a boxing champion, and it was such that he struck an interest with Peekay in boxing, and from there on when he met Hoppy, he just had to learn. Hoppy thought Peekay was a natural, and truly encouraged him in the short time they had together. <br /> <br />When he reaches home, he goes out one day to meet a new friend  <br />that would always be there for him for the next many years of Peekay's life. \\"Doc,\\" as he was called was an older established professor of music who was retired in the story. He latched on to the boy right away, and was like a father to Peekay. One day though, Doc was sent to prison much to the shock of many others, and Peekay was devastated. But within a short time, he connected with \\"Doc,\\" in jail and not only did Peekay visit Doc, but the other prisoners became his greatest of friends. This is also where he learned the real sport of boxing. The prison offered classes in it, and Peekay was accepted even though he was too young, (about 8 at the time), they accepted him as he was overly eager to learn. <br /> <br />This started a whole new life for Peekay. He beat everyone in the ring, even some of the toughest men. He grew with boxing into bigger and bigger tournaments, and later when he started a new boarding school, was the most well-knownkid there for his outstanding talents as a boxer. His new friend Morrie became his partner in business, and later they hired the best teacher Solly, who was the BEST in the boxing division in Africa. <br /> <br />The book is definitely a great read, and a story you won't  <br />forget after reading. I will probably try Tandia later.	2005-01-22

As her probing continues, she gets more and more concrete facts together, and then becomes suspicous of people during her travels for these facts.  <br /> <br />Of course, toward the end, (I don't want to spoil it), Kinsey gets too close to the real killer, and just might get herself into a bad situation she may not be able to get out of without a struggle. <br /> <br />The question is, did Justine, an old friend help in the murder?

This is the first of Joyce Carol Oates which I have read, and though it was a bit long, enjoyed this family story very well. <br /> <br />The story begins with the family history. The Mulvaney's were a wealthy farming family who prospered well and whom everyone knew. <br />They were picture perfect with their four children; three boys and one girl. But as we all know, perfect doesn't last forever, and when Marianne keeps her rape a secret, and it's finally discovered by her mother Corinne, the family simply falls apart from there. And Marianne, for reasons I never understood, was exiled from her family. <br /> <br />The dad, Michael Mulvaney, resorts to drinking, and becomes a terrible alcoholic, and Patrick, the second of the boys, attempts to murder Marianne's rapist.  <br /> <br />Marianne wants her parents love so badly, especially that of her father. But by the time wounds are healing, it is almost too late. <br /> <br />The book is very sad, and gets a little better toward the end.

His hatred for women stemmed from the time he was little, and his mother mistreated him a lot, and favored his older brother much more. <br /> <br />As a boy, he would have fetishes for ladies clothing/lingerie, and steal them from neighbors who had women living there. He committed his first murder later as a married man.  <br /> <br />After Jerry was married to Darcie, and she bore him two children, one of them a girl child, whom he didn't love at all, Jerry became much worse. In their home in Oregon, he had a workshop that was kept secret from the family at all times. He'd kill the women, and put them in his workshop, and do the most sadistic things to them, then murder them usually by strangulation.  <br /> <br />The women he murdered were all young and pretty. Linda Slawson was an encyclopedia saleslady door-to-door. Jan Whitney was a young college student, and Karen Sprinker was a pre-med student on the way to lunch with her mother, when she was murdered by Jerry. And not to mention, there was Linda Salee, who kept her boyfriend waiting for hours, worried sick about what happened to her. <br /> <br />The police finally put the two and two together, and it was then that Jerry was apprehended. And it was surprising that when he was caught, he told the stories of the women's murders openly, as though he was proud of it. <br /> <br />His wife unfortunately was considered an accessory to the crimes though she had absolutely no idea what was going on in her own home. But it is a long trial before her slate can be wiped clean. <br />Their two children unfortunately, are taken into custody by the state until all of the evidence is proven otherwise that Darcie Brudos is innocent. <br /> <br />	2004-10-03

He shows up, and is a form of support to both Dana and the girls. <br />Sam starts to really fall in love with Dana, but Dana won't let herself get too close to him.

It is a very sad story about two twin brothers. Dominick, the strong one, is well and functional, while Thomas is really very handicapped in that he gradually develops schizophrenia. Thomas totally relies on Dominick to uphold him through the whole story. He is totally dependent on his brother to fight his battles for him throughout their lives. <br /> <br />The book begins with Dominick, the well twin, and Thomas who go into the library. Thomas has a horrible idea in his head to cut off his hand before everyone, as he says that's the sacrifice God wanted him to make in this world. So when the authorities are called in, they haul Thomas away in the ambulance along with his brother of course, with his severed hand. Thomas insists that they not re-attach the hand, and that is how the story goes from there.  <br /> <br />Thomas gets committed to what we refer to as  'the funny farm,' which is Hatch Institute for crazy people. He must be committed there by law as authorities feel he is a danger to society. Dominick fights and fights horribly over this cruel decision, as it is the worst possible place for Thomas to go. But of course, Thomas will remain there for a very long time to come. <br /> <br />The book from that incident flips back over the years of their lives, and as I read, I've never heard of such rotten luck. The step-father Ray was horribly abusive to both boys, and the mother had to stand back and watch it. It seemed she had no control over the abuse that took place. Of course Thomas suffers more at the hands of Ray than Dominick, and never stands a chance. So there too, Dominick tries to run interference for his brother-but it doesn't always work. Poor Thomas takes a lot more beatings. <br /> <br />Dominick has off again/on again relationships in his life with women. He had been married once, and lost a child to sudden-infant-death-syndrome. He and his wife Dessa became divorced after that point, and also due to the fact that she resented Thomas as every one of the women in Dominick's life did. <br /> <br />The outcome, which of course I won't say is very sad. Thomas always wanted to know his biological father, and later he finds a journal that had been written about his grandfather that was written by his dad. In it, he tries to find some answers about why what happened, happened to Thomas,and maybe why he was the weak twin. <br /> <br />Very good to read, but be prepared for a little bit too lenghty book though. It could have ended about 200 pages sooner.	2004-09-20

It was after that event that Ellen went to live with her grandmother, who only treated her as a slave by making her work in the cotton fields, and then after that, she went to live with her very unloving aunt and niece, who were only mean to her. <br /> <br />Throughout the story she has a colored friend, namely Starletta, who is the one young friend that loves Ellen unconditionally. She is always there for her. <br /> <br />As I read this book, it made me feel sad that so many children are unloved in this world, and cast about, without any guidance ever. Ellen was a strong girl though, who in spute of that, stood up strong in all of her adversity.	2004-08-16

His many wives would die after he took out a life insurance policy on each one of them, and he would collect benefits on each one. The detectives began to suspect foul play and when they investigated, put Randy on trial for the murders of his many wives. He was also a very abusive father in the story, treating his own son, and stepsons very cruelly. It was unreal what this man did and got by with for too long until he was caught.<br />The other stories are murder mysteries. They tell of young girls in their teens and early twenties who had been brutally murdered.<br />I would recommend this book if you enjoy true-crime books.

She always knew she wanted to be a writer, and the gift of storytelling was a part of Mary's Irish ancestry. It followed naturally then that she would use her sharp eye, keen intelligence, and inquisitive nature to create stories about the people and things around her.<br />Along with all Americans, those who lived in New York City's borough of the Bronx suffered during the Depression. In this time, Mary's father died, her mother, deciding to open the family home to boarders, placed a discreet sign next to the front door that read, Furnished Rooms, Kitchen Privleges. Very shortly, the first in a succession of tenants arrived: a couple dodging bankruptcy who moved in with their wild-eyed boxer; a teacher who wept endlessly over her lost love; a deabeat who tripped over a lamp while trying to sneak out in the middle of the night.<br />The story continues from there all about the family's struggle to make ends meet. Mary also had many jobs before becoming the author she is today. She wrote many short stories first before writing real novels, and spoke of her many rejections before finally finding a publisher to accept her work.<br />She had two other brothers. One died in World War II, the other one became very ill and passed away at a young age. Later, she married Warren Clark, and had five children with him. One of which, Carol, is an author today, following in her mom's footsteps.<br />The book is very interesting and informative on one of the very best mystery-suspense authors today.	2003-01-01

I had to stop reading it after a certain point, (the first 160 pages or so), as it was so boring!<br />Prey takes us into the story of a mechanical plaque, and the desparate efforts of scientists to stop it. It speaks a lot of nantechnology and artificial disturbed intelligence. <br />The plot was weak and never really picked up again. I wouldn't waste my money on this book!	2002-12-19

He didn't lead an exemplary life-he was too self-absorbed to ever really think about anyone else or make a commitment to the woman he loved. On the other hand though, he did have some good character traits. His actual misdeeds were few-his were sins of omission, but not comission.<br />It is just a few days before Christmas. For about 46 years, Sterling is lingering in the celestial waiting room outside the heavenly gates. He is awaiting summons from the Heavenly Council. Will he be deemed fit for entrance into heaven? At last the day comes and the council settles on a test for Sterling-he will be sent back to earth and given a real opportunity to help someone else as he never has before.<br />Sterling Brooks will find himself in Manhattan, at the skating rink in Rockefeller Center. Among the skaters is a heartbroken seven-year-old named Marissa, and as Sterling soon realizes, it is she he has been sent to help. Marissa's sadness comes from her separation from the father she adores greatly, and her sparkling grandmother who is owner of a popular restaurant. Both have been forced into the Witness Protection Program because two mobsters, the Badgett brothers, have put a price  on their heads<BR>to prevent their testifying against an arson case.<br />I enjoyed the short book as a whole, and love Mary Higgins Clark's writing a lot.	2002-12-18

True, it has a lot of descriptions in it of the background scenes. But the journey Ayla and Jondular are taking is very interesting along the way. They are trying their very hardest to get back to Jondular's folks, taking their animal friends, Whinney, Racer, and the Wolf. Along the way though they meet a lot of dangers. Their odyssey spans a beautiful but sparsely populated and treacherous continent, the windswept grasslands of Ice Age Europe, casting the pair among strangers. Some will be intrigued by Ayla and Jondular, with their many innovative skills, including the taming of wild horses and a wolf; others will avoid them; feeling threatened by what they cannot understand.<BR>Some people will also threaten them along their way.<br />I enjoyed this book even more and more as I got into it. Parts of it tended to drag a bit, but I didn't think it was too bad. And for the most part, Jean Auel wrote a great continuing sequel!	2002-12-16

Blessings telles us the story of Skip Cuddy, who is caretaker of the estate, who finds a baby asleep in the box that was left there.

By the machinations of fate and the vagaries of the 18th century English judicial system, he is consigned as a convict to the famous &quot;First Fleet,&quot; which set sail, bearing, as an experiment in penology, 582 male and 193 female felons sentenced to transportation, in May of 1787 for the continent that Captain Cook had discovered only a few years earlier.<br />Richard Morgan was a convict who stood out, not only for his strength and his calm determination to let no man bully him, but also for his intellect, fair-mindedness, common sense, and willingness to help others. To these qualities must be added a certain innate dignity that hinted, even at the most terrible conditions, at a life marked by tragedies that would have broken most men.<br />I enjoyed this book pretty well.

It was nothing short of a miracle that she regained the strength in her legs to walk again.<br />Many of these people, if they didn't obey the rules before them, suffered very severe punishment, and many were sent to the gas chamber. Eli's fragile Aunt Selena was one of the victims in the story.Eli's teenaged brother Bubi, also barely survived this horrid war. He became ill and malnourished for a long time.<BR>Eli also had hope when they returned home finally,that her<BR>father was still alive somewhere.

I say dysfunctional because her mom had an illness. She claimed every time she smelled the scent of oranges, or had an orange around her, it would make her come down with these blinding headaches. She would have to go to bed for days on end sometimes and the kids would be left to their own devices. Frambiose goes on to tell then of their days growing up while her mom was debilitated, and often almost intolerable to live with.<br />Later, after Frambiose's other dies, she leaves a scrapbook to Framboise written with a lot of recipes over the years, along with many of her mother's secrets. <br />It was one of the most different books I have read, and overall I enjoyed the book.	2002-10-21

This is one of the most different books of a series that I have ever read before and I truly LOVED it! Clan of the Cave Bear is action-packed,and very engrossing all the way through from beginning to end.<br />The story centers around the little girl, Ayla, who loses her family in an earthquake and is left alone all by herself at 5 years old trying to survive.

The story really takes off after that.<BR>You'll meet Violet Aird, who's turning 78 years old, and her family Edmund, her son,along with Virginia, her daughter-in-law, and Henry their son. Also is Isobel and Archie, and their son Hamish who live in Croy, a very large estate. <br />Other characters include Edie, the lovely neighbor and best friend of Violet's.

Pandora, who hasn't been home for years is coming to town with a very sad secret.

She is sent home after supposedly becoming stable however, and creates a problem for everyone.<br />The book is all about love, betrayals, forgiveness and coming together.

The book was very exciting and well written about a psychopath who kidnaps and kills people. The story begins with the character who is the crazy guy, Gary Soneji/Murphy who has multiple severe personality disorders along with being a complete nut-case due to his terrible childhood. Gary Soneji/Murphy plays a school teacher at a day-school for rich kids when his intent is really to kidnap and kill the Dunne/Goldberg children. And finally, one day he lured the children into his van and kidnaps them, drugging one and eventually killing the other child. This kidnapping has the whole DC area up in arms, and Alex Cross works day and night to capture Soneji/Murphy, but he doesn't do that until he kills a few more people in different places. His whole game throughout the book is that he \\"Wants to be Somebody.\\" He is the master of killing, and he enjoys the game.<br />Alex Cross trys to help all he can, and he gets inside Soneji/Murphy's head and gets him to tell him all of his horrible little secrets after Soneji gets captured the first time and put into prison. Later though, Soneji escapes from prison and causes more problems. More than just Soneji/Murphy though, is an accomplice. Alex fell in love with a female detective on his team, not realizing that she is actually the one behind more of these problems with the kidnappings and knows the answers to what happened with the children.<br />Cross puts the puzzle all together, and the book is very fast moving and keeps you guessing what will happen next!	2002-08-17

She lives in Big Stone Gap Virginia in the lovely mountains where it feels like 'down home.' Ave Maria's mom has passed away, and she has had a hard time getting on with her life, but she does gradually, and things go on from there. She is the town spinster at 35 years of age, and has a hard time of finding love. She has two wonderul male friends though, and will she find love with one of them? You must read this to find out!<br />Other events happen as well, after her mother's death occurs. Her mom was hiding something from Ave Maria for many years and it is not until her death that Ave finds out what this is. Her mom has written her a letter telling her something inside of her will. To find out what this is all about, you REALLY will have to read the book once again.<br />Ave Maria also owns a pharmacy in Big Stone Gap and knows many people in the whole town. Early on in the book though, a high school girl comes into Ave's life that really needs someone to look up to. Her name is Pearl, and she and Ave instantly form a friendship that is long-lasting. Ave makes her a deal later in the story that she just can't refuse.<br />With all the scandals, heartaches, troubles, and life-changing decisions that occur in Ave's life, this is a wonderful read!

Annette does just that, and they all have a big fight with one another until an incident happens to bring them together while meeting at Annette's home. <BR>I don't know-this story lacked something though. I think it was that she didn't develop the characters enough for the plot which was shallow somehow. I see where more could have been developed and elaborated on before the run-in with each other at the meeting took place. <br />Belva Plain usually writes with more depth than this with each one of her characters in the past books I read of hers.

Michael is a sweet kid, and one day on the way to catholic mass, the Rabbi Hirsch calls out to Micael to come in and do him a favor. Michael walks in the building with the rabbi Hirsch, and then an instant friendship is formed.<BR>The rabbi teaches Michael all about jewish history and yiddish, while Michael teaches the rabbi to speak better english.

Frankie is a big troublemaker and has a killing temper. He and a group of people start a lot of fights and hurt Michael pretty badly in one scene. They continue making problems until the get their 'dues' later in the book.<BR>The language was just a bit too rough at times, especially with Michael's friends. The author has them swearing just a little bit too much, I felt. But other than that, the story is well-written.	2002-08-07

Then the girls each meet a man. Hilary gets married to the kind down-to-earth Martin, and Ria meets up with Danny at her job. Danny is a little too smooth. Beneath that cool smile there's waters deep. You have to read to know what I mean here. Anyhow, Danny says they will have an expensive house on Tara Road, and Ria wonders how. Danny pulled some strings to get in there. They go on as a family, later having two children. <BR>Later on though there is a devastating betrayal that happens to Ria and she doesn't know how to get through it. It so happens at this time, that another woman gets in contact with Ria for an opportunity to exchange homes for the summer. This gives Ria some solace, and taking this other woman up on it, she goes to the US and the other woman, Marilyn, moves into Ria's house on Tara Road in Ireland.

As I read this true story,I wondered what it was that made her tick and why a person could have such a hate on for one of her own children. And yet, through the story, David craved his mother's love so desparately, and he did love her. As he was sent to a foster home, he still sometimes tried to return to his mothers house. And she could never ever muster the least little bit of love for David. As I read, I could not figure out why the siblings, who knew what was happening, as well as the father, didn't report her much much sooner. <br />This story will bring tears to your eyes.

There are NOT ENOUGH superlatives in my book to describe how i feel about Rosamunde Pilcher's writing in Shell Seekers! It must have taken her many thoughtful, contemplative moments before putting this wonderful family saga together! All I can say is, she is a very very RICH writer in her scenes, background descriptions,and also her colorful use of words in her sentence structure. It was HARD to put down, and I was wrapped right in to it the whole time I read!	2002-07-07

I did not think that this book made any sense-and it was the first of Barbara Michaels I have read. <BR> <BR>What happened to the plot? She really dropped it, and the story just barely held my interest at all. It was one of those books that the synopsis made it sound more interesting than it actually was; in other words misleading to me. <br />If you're looking for a book that is entertaining and interesting with a lot of character, don't go for this one!	2002-07-07

Anne Rivers Siddons has a talent for eventful writing, and creating the scenery behind the events so you can picture it in your mind! I enjoyed the story lines of the fragile children, and Maude Chamblisses character very much. The book keeps you guessing what is going to happen next in the children's lives as well as everyone else. I HIGHLY recommend it for an entertaining read!	2002-07-07

I loved this book a lot,and the further I read the better and better it became. The plot of a poor family working hard in the fields day in and day out made a very interesting saga, along with all of the other happenings and events of a familie's survival skills from day to day. Grisham did a wonderful job of his scenery, which I was able to picture very well as I read the story, along with the characterization. The end wasn't really an end, though, and this story I feel, definitely needs a sequel as there are many unfinished events. How does the Chandler family fare in their new area when they move? Do they return back home later? What continues to happen with Luke? How about the mom's new baby she's expecting? There needs to be a sequel!	2002-07-07

This is the first I have read of John Saul, and I found the book entertaining to say the least, but maybe a bit far-fetched. Realistically, it couldn't happen in real life, as it did with the character Julie, and she was still walking around surviving, yet being eaten alive with insects. Yet, though it wasn't realistic, I found it very interesting to keep on reading the book to see what would happen next. The ending was a good one.	2002-07-07

I personally thought that the book was great once I got past  the first couple of chapters. I was able to see the events in my mind as Belva Plain described the scenes behind the story! It was a very sad betrayal between real friends, and was written very well. As I read, I couldn't wait to see what the reactions would be once the betrayal was discovered. I could feel each and every emotion of the characters as it was described in the story. This story is actuallu true to what happens in real life situations in marriages.	2002-07-07

The beginning of this book is just a little bit hard to get into as it talks about a spoiled rotten kid who felt she had everything to do with killing her mother.But when Nora arrives, the plot thickens and the story becomes much more entertaining and engrossing from there on. Anne Rivers Siddons has a way of writing with a different style with each book she composes, and this one though written well, is quite differently written then her others.	2002-07-07

Pilcher sets his the stage for the story before really taking off with the main theme, so you need to be little bit patient as he sets the tone. Emotions are expressed VERY well as you move through the story, and you can feel for the characters and their happenings throughout the book. As I read, I could form pictures in my mind of the background scenes and the characters which were written with wonderful descriptions and scenes.	2002-07-01
