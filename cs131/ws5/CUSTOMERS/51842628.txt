The increasing difficulties in achieving original results or, more likely, in developing non repetitive hints become quite clear in this textbook. <br />An averagely expert professional has happened to meet most impossibilities quoted in the book, and experienced how integration issues are often the synthesis of sociological, psychological, technical and economical facets. Unfortunately, the wider the scope an essay aims to, the more vagueness it risks. <br />Good writing, proper references and sound solutions are not enough to stand out against the equally good tens of publications available about the subject. Like as many of them, it becomes a very elegant source for material to speak ABOUT the work in data warehouse environment (a treasure for slide shows!), or that can be very useful to present the whole of it to a beginner,  but carrying out an actual development is a different matter. <br />	2005-09-13

The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille). <br />An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language. <br />	2005-08-08

Though it tries to be self-contained in introducing the wavelet subject, the resultin theoretical structure is poor. and general properties of wavelets remain scattered for all over the book, leaving some gaps. Perhaps my opinion is biased by being used to classical introductions stressed on Multi Resolution Analysis. Moreover, the habit of carrying on calculation with explicit indexes, quoting intermediate results and unusual notations (e.g. denoting a function as x(.) instead of x(t) in order not to bind to a specificic variable) clutter the book with cumbersome expressions, even if in that form they can be straightforwardly rendered in computer routines. I just wonder how people without a previous knowledge about wavelet methods can have dealt with the textbook.	2005-03-23

Actually, ETLing matches the whole of the data warehouse (more or less), so the need to describe them makes this book an autonomous work you can read without referring to previous books by Kimball. Besides, I think that some technical descriptions have been better performed here: in my experience it is impossible to undertake dwh activities without (at least) a sound knowledge about general features (indexes, use of a bulk loader vs. INSERT, etc.) of RDBMS, and this paper addresses them conveniently. On the other hand, the flat style used lacks to give evidence to the very significant issues, which happen so to be mixed up with less important statements; that demands to pay high attention while reading,  but a blurring boundary between subtleties and trivialities seems to be a common shortcoming in dwh literature. Even with that flaw, the ETL Toolkit turn out as an outstanding reference to state of the art of dwh technology.	2005-03-22

That base, the main character's (Ono) previous history and background is being slowly and progressively formed along all the novel, and slightly referenced, when it is necessary to provide some more information to the tale.  <br />It is remarkable how some particulars, either of the environment (such as bulldozer's noise) or of the behaviour of characters, match similar memories of the reader, or, at least, similar memories of mine. Maybe those matches made me to high rate the novel. Or perhaps I perceived some ambiguity in the language not in the author original intention: in spite of the definition he comes to give about \\"floating world\\" as \\"not permanent\\", I have read all the novel keeping in mind \\"unsteady\\", and understanding the meaning of the whole world. I simply discarded as a literary artifact other interpretations: the advantage of being a reader  is that you can give the sense you like to what you reading, so the same meaning becomes floating.	2005-03-16

The latter has the unfortunate feature that lhs terms do not depend on reader's characteristics while the rhs one does, but, for all practical purposes it works.  A book about the subject randomly chosen is likely to have such a factor far above the equality, but this one seems to be quite close. <br /> However, that does not mean it is popular science: its ideal target are Physics students with at least a knowledge of \\"classical\\" (i.e. non relativistic) quantum mechanics and its main applications in electromagnetic fields. <br /> I would have appreciated more material about experiments (after all, my university course stretches from 1979, when Glashow, Salam and Weinberg were awarded with the Nobel prize for their theory of electroweak interaction, and 1984, when Rubbia and van der Meer got it for the observation of intermediate vector boson), but I have to acknowledge that there was hardly any room left for such references, unless publishing a very heavy book, taking also into account the search for an equilibrium between educational issues and an updated sight. <br /> Besides, the way environmental knowledge has been reproduced, with all notation misuse and omissions of non-significant terms or methods, represents a fresh and fashionable picture of current teaching (and learning) physics, at least about the subjects I remember (I have not studied, and I do not know, unless for popular papers, string theory, maybe present days students argue about that with habits unknown to me).

As soon as you read it, you realize that it is a previous instantiation of the same template shared by TDVC, almost a testbed for the latter (I prefer not to spoil surprise and give no details about the strong similarities). But, in a personal view, I have found far more interesting hints here than in the more famous novel. First, in TDVC the action takes place in France, whilst A&D is based in  Rome (I happen to be Italian, and to go daily to Rome for work); A&D somehow refers to physics and CERN (I have got a degree in physics, even if not oriented in particles theory); it deals with obscure associations, which relate to Italian Academies (an editing work committed by my wife for a thesis of hers left me some knowledge about the subject).  In a few words, my background seemed to fit perfectly to the details in order to appreciate the novel. I suspect that feature made me to find exciting a novel that I would have otherwise considered poorly refined and boring: almost every quote or reference in the novel, about physics, organization of Catholic Church, use of Italian language is wrong, or odd, or at least unusual. Sometimes I have met misuses which show hilarious sides, for example, in a sentence Brown makes the female character, to state \\"If this guy disappears, we're fungito\\" and adds Langdon knew enough Italian to know she was right.. I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ITALIAN TO KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS, and that, together with many other errors, shook the certainty I have always been thinking of myself as a proper Italian mother-tongue. As a consequence, I had the curiosity to read how many sentences had been translated into Italian, but a quick search showed that an Italian edition will be released only in 2005.  But, to be honest, that flood of oddities does not turn out to be a fundamental flaw; instead, giving a grotesque flavour to the whole, it enhances the general humour and speed the pacing action, and adding also a sort of treasure hunt (Which kind of silly surprise will the author manage to create in the next pages?) to the many ones already present. Of course, overwhelming presence of errors is a common feature in instant books, but I have never met before a collection so closely related to my background.  I have been a bit more disappointed by the usual tricky way the author used to raise reader's attention, by cutting narration off abruptly, omitting explanation of fully visible and referred clues, and postponing them to further chapters, a device, in general opinion, a good writer should always avoid. The general plot is somewhat deceiving as well: Brown narrows down blatantly the possible identity of the villain, the mysterious commissioner of all crimes, to a unique character, and with a sudden and rough switch (just a bit rougher than in TDVC), reveals his real identity. Besides, at that point, the final rush seems to be end less, and becomes sometimes quite boring.  Eventually, I have to take into account that I began to read TDVC, and went on with A&D, while looking for not too demanding books: they can be appreciated ever referring to that expectation.	2004-10-04

This book is a strong instance. Even if it is arguable on so many sides, it represents nonetheless an amusing and capturing reading. But, in a sense, I have found it deceiving. As a first, a main rule in a fiction book requires that the reader shall have the same action visibility of protagonists. That rule has been systematically broken: the author refers continuously to elements the characters see, or recurs to their memories, whose explanation is postponed, sometimes after several chapters. For example, in the initial part, inside Louvre, every time a message is mentioned, the thread is interrupted, the focus is moved to a parallel one (there are ever three or four at the same time), and only when it is retrieved the description is completed. This suspension is an easy trick to increase reader's curiosity, but made me feeling a sense of incumbent delay, artificially and purportedly created, respect to the narrative flow. Nothing bad: even Conan Doyle often omitted a complete context definition, appending later additional information, but that technique causes a really different impression when used in a novel more than in short tales. As an extreme comparison, you can think how appalling can result a crime book where the guilty turns out to be a chap never mentioned before. I found that basic rule usually respected by other good bestseller authors, e.g. JK Rowling or Robert Harris, just to limit examples.<br /><br />Of course, you cannot ignore the huge, but very few accurate and very superficial, cultural background Brown builds to support the fast pacing action. A pinch of mathematical games, cryptography, a bit more art, a lot of history (mostly fictionalised) yields a highly refined recipe, which has turned out very good to sell.<br /><br />A comic side effect of the novel is the mass of erudite criticisms that have been written about. Those critics seem to be the only people to take the Holy Grail story seriously, worrying about confute it and pouring an endless list of references and episodes (which any navigator can find however in the Net). Naturally, authors dealing with such a subject have not many opportunities to get some visibility, so you must be comprehensive. But, considering also that, with a treachery far subtler than their textual analysis, they reveal most of the plot, you are better off reading their reviews AFTER you have read the novel.<br /><br />On the other side, Dan Brown could have spared the allegedly historical introducing remark, whose claiming about reality of Priory of Sion is at least dubious (i.e. manifestly wrong), and which misses also the actual nature of controversies that invested Opus Dei, which has been involved more in financial scandals than accusations of brainwashing or dangerous practices.<br /><br /> So, concluding, a Cartland-like thriller, superficial, exaggerate, an editorial firework, fast-pacing, sometimes ridiculous, a pleasant reading to pass time, but nothing remarkable.take the Holy Grail story seriously, worrying about confute it and pouring an endless list of references and episodes (which any navigator can find however in the Net).

Well, that statement is true for almost all sciences, both social and technical, and surely for their development during XIX century. Once I have been warned by the author that Orientalism has been built above prejudices, and I have been given some significant examples of that, I would prefer not to go through a myriad of further instances to support the initial thesis. Besides, Orientalism's functional facet to Colonialism are widely mentioned, but poorly deepened. That would have required an interdisciplinary approach - cultural, political, historical, ethnological and, why not, scientific - whilst this book is mainly an academic report about textual analysis. Another interesting side, i.e. why Oriental studies are carried on mainly by Western people?, is explained in a few final pages, and in my opinion it would have deserved much more space. So, when Said admits in his 1994 Afterword (probably the worthiest chapter in the whole book) that he has no interest, or capacity, in showing true Orient or Islam, I think he achieves an excessive restriction of the subject \\"Middle East\\" (because in this essay \\"Orient\\" means that), limiting its suitability to a general audience (which I belong to). There are of course many appreciable hints, but the general style, with its obsessive repetitions, reminds me too much of the political prose common in the 70's, even if Said makes a visible effort to maintain a scholar objectivity. In summary, I did not dislike the book, but I probably lack the specific knowledge necessary to fully appreciate it.	2004-05-05

Many books by D. Hofstadter are at the top standings of my personal parade, but in reading this book I found myself very likely too distant from my usual interests and preferred styles. The initial part is very interesting, but when the author carries on detailed descriptions about programs' features in conversational shape, I have been quickly bored, and I have given up attentive reading turning to an eagle eye approach. I would have been by far more comfortable with a more formal explanation, because, once I make the effort to follow the thourough description of what and how a program does, it is more convenient to study its algorithms.<BR>So, the book is surely very pleasing for people professionally involved in semantics, but I am not confident in its general interest.	2004-04-22

Even if this book does not fully accomplish that goal, but it represents a very interesting step toward that. Meaningful digressions (for example use and classification of data models in a company environment) alternates with prolix explanations in which significant hints get lost (e.g. time dimension in calendar modeling). I think the authors would have been better of deepening the material at a  bit more advanced and principle-founded level (for example, it is usually considered a must referring to complexity formalism when dealing with binary trees as indexing technique), but I agree too that other readers may not: in Italy such books are considered, in spite of their generality, technical, but foreign professionals I have met consider them suitable, even if not mandatory, to business consultants. Using more formal approaches would have likely discouraged many potential readers. <BR> Besides, I have appreciated the clear statement about technological convenience of relational versus the dimensional technology: though the latter is undeniably more advanced, in my experience conditions that make it preferable are very seldom met.	2004-04-21

Even it, alone, left me a strange impression, as a result of an usual mix of war, science fiction and sex (very few, however, but then considered enough for rating). The book has been a full confirmation of that boyhood memory: strict language, dark humour, plenty of references (The Execution of Private Slovik is an interesting historical note), an underlying structure uncorrelated events are attached over, build up an environment logical and confused at the same time. All books by Vonnegut I have read so far are someway related to previous references or boyhood memories, so I sensed a hint of completion of old knowledge by their reading. So considering him as the best author in science fiction may be an exaggeration, but I am glad I have read this book now: I think I could have not appreciated the random jumps in the thread when I was used to the \\"fairy tale\\" SF.	2004-03-22

The synthesis of cognitive science items, literature studies and personal experiences , together with an incredibly polished and refined language, into which English, French, Italian and others converge, makes this book a unique accomplished experiment. But I think it requires an unusual attention, and, unfortunately, I cannot afford to spend a very long time about translation difficulties, so distant from my daily activities. And even if Marot is neither Bach nor Escher (let alone Godel), and his poetry has none of their art, the strict entanglement between form and meaning Hofstadter successfully gives evidence to, raises interest also to the otherwise insignificant poem used as book's leitmotiv. Maybe, being Italian my mother tongue, my appreciation of the chapters about Dante' Comedy's translation could lead me to overestimation. The subject lacks of an appeal as wide as Godel, Escher, Bach, but the balance between a so personal style (the haunting memories diffused into the book) and a high level abstraction (the search for meaning), makes me feel the harmony of \\"the music of language\\".	2004-03-11

In spite of the surprise arisen by finding starships and exterior planets replaced with strange religions and oppressing social rules, the subtlety used in the descriptions of human relations and the complexity of built-up structures make the latter more agreeable to experienced readers. Unfortunately, that complexity seems to be quite difficult to turn to a well defined termination, and the story looks like suspended. I have no idea about how such a termination could be, and too often complex contexts cannot be reduced to simpler ones, so I do not afford to say that the author has failed something or the novel lacks in conclusion. But, to be honest, I slightly miss it.	2004-02-12

It contains some technical issues, more in the form of hints and tips than fully developed solutions, that have nowadays become common and wide-known features.

The life of Galileo's daughter would have been a very interesting opportunity to exam this issue from a quite different perspective. This opportunity vanishes yet in the first chapters, and the tale of Suor Maria Celeste (the name she got as a nun) becomes a mere translation of her letters collected by Galileo. Besides, you can hardly find something new even among them. That facilitated history (tabloid-like) flows easily, but it lacks of reality: you can hardly believe that Galileo'daughter accepted so willingly the fate her father decided when she was a child.

It seems that the author, anxious to be recognized as the first scholar to discover a controversial, but undeniable, truth, wrote it in a hurry, lacking deepness to overcome in speed other possible competitors. That leads sometimes to make some positions extreme and ingenuous: for example, even if some Jewish organizations have forced reparations off from Swiss banks, without a real behalf and can be highly suspected to use that funds to finance their activities more than to support survivors, I can hardly agree with the picture of Swiss banks themselves as innocent institutions who ignored the Holocaust events and made no profits with Nazis during WWII and who are now victims of blackmailing. In the same way, you must not forget that many Nazi high functionaries had important commitments in Western Germany after the war. So Finkelstein's book can be a step in the right direction, but it should have been more very balanced. But to be honest, as a comparison, prefer his method, that I consider right even ill-applied, to other more dogmatic approaches. In spite of superficiality of his book, Finkelstein has surely chosen the right moment, besides the right direction. The subject of Holocaust, after many years of latency, have been recently reawakened by some well-spread controversies (Lipstadt-Irving, Goldhagen) and by some very good studies (Browning). So any other scholar who is going to study the consequences of Holocaust in modern society will not be able to afford to ignore Finkelstein's book. In that sense, the book has also been a very successful promotional task. But a point must me stated quite cleat: it is NOT an issue about WHAT Holocaust was IN THE PAST, but HOW Holocaust is NOW used. So, it shares nothing with revisionism and negationism, and it deals much more with actuality than with history.	2003-04-15

I found very surprising how a Japanese author can acquire (absorb I think a more suitable word) the most British style, turning it into a so personal thread, in which a trip of few days becomes the occasion to flash back a whole life, spent in a screened service as a butler in a high gentry house, in which the protagonist has been having some opportunities to find himself \\"close to the hub of the wheel\\", receiving slight echoes of the main current events of the outer world: debates about Versailles Treaty, appeasement, the rise of German Nazi Party, anti-Semitism, the war. All that softened by the professional burden of the butler, by the local quarrels and arguments. So two main threads are followed by the protagonist, creating two competing tensions: the former backwards, i.e. a more and more precise depicting of lord Darlington, up to his final involvement with the Nazis, the latter the approaching to Miss Kenton's living place, along which the author, in a slightly deceiving way, builds what seem to be a desire of regain lost time. Both threads are left unresolved: you do not come to a complete knowledge of what happened to lord Darlington, and Mr. Stevens, the protagonist, finds Ms. Kenton married and waiting for the birth of a grandson. Such a literary joke is proper to the great ability of the writer, and makes a book a masterpiece not only in fiction, but also in the more subtle art of language use.	2003-01-02

It is an interesting story in the environment of WWII, matching military issues and Holocaust items, which can be seen as the convergence of several witnesses, on the landscape of birth of the Israel nation. It is an advisable reading, even if not a milestone, written by a very flowing style. It is not an ideological issue, nor a propaganda pamphlet. It is a plain witness, as simple as taking part to a world war can be, and facing, and an unusual Jewish point of view of the Holocaust.  However, I have been disappointed by discovering that the photo collection inside the paperback edition is as half as the hardcover one.	2003-01-02

The book is well written, and Keneally turns out a very skilled writer, but the main interest lays of course in the narrated events, and I am a bit puzzled about classifying the book either as fiction or biographical. The most outstanding feature I met is the different kinds of rhetoric used by the writer and by the director: the former strict, descriptive and inquiring, the latter powerful and simplifying. Keneally takes the core event as an axiom, and do not to prove it, while he examines the complex stream of events that have taken place in such a complex situation. He also admits that some events, such as the rescue of women from Auschwitz, have never found a satisfactory explanation, and that he is not able to detect when Oskar Schindler made up is mind in trying to save the Jews, then he tells what happened. A completely different view is provided by Spielberg. Moving first from a rough approximation of the events reported in the book, he reinvents the story, depicting it as the human development and moral growth of Schindler. For example, all along the book Schindler remains an unfaithful husband, whilst in the movie it seems that at the end, when back to Brunnlitz, he makes some kinds of promises to his wife Emilie, and also the ending script refers of a \\"failure of the wedlock\\": in the book, it is explicitly written that Schindler left his Emilie. In the book the different natures of Oskar Schindler are always con contemporarily present. In the movie he seems like St. Paul on the road to Damascus; in the book he \\"is dallying like Zeus\\". According to Keneally, many other Germans give help to Jews, but none of them is mentioned in the film. In a nut, I would say that Keneally tried to tell Schindler's story, and Spielberg,however giving a likelihood representation of Holocaust, have wrought out a story of his own.	2002-09-13

Besides, the novel is well written, historical references are well chosen and the Holocaust described as a spinning out theme is a good fiction of a sceptical mind facing an unbelievable event. The protagonist, detective Xavier March, reluctantly enrolled in SS, resembles many other not-too-heroic characters (I have been always sympathetic with that kind of unfortunate). A casual event, a few days before Fuehrertag (Hitler's birhtday) will make him involved in a more and more complex web of history and politics. There is not a happy-end, which would have been very unlikely, but, in a someway optimistic foresight, March, even if beaten, is not defeated, for his sacrifice, displaying the great crime undertaken by Nazis, will give an active contribution to accelerate the fall of a social system, even if still fully empowered. Either you like a weekend book or a hint to further studies, the book is worth reading.	2002-08-06

The fact that both UML and XML syntaxes are not explained in detail should not induce to consider this issue as an introductory one: a thorough comprehension of all quoted subjects presumes a good knowledge of a structured (possibly object oriented) programming language and some reference to an XML syntax textbook and a UML guide. You do not learn by this book either designing UML or writing XML code, but it represents a survey about the subject that can be interesting both for skilled people and beginners.	2002-06-21

To be honest, I do not realize which or where the new kind of science is. I do not understand whether it represents either the work of a genius (because Wolfram has really been like that) gone out of his head or a clever, and profitable, publishing operation of the CEO of a successful company, producing one of the best scientific sw products in the world. But the author's authority by itself does not turn a common book into an excellent one. The result is a slightly interesting, and heavily boring, book, with an accurate, and overvalued, editorial setting: a paperback and lighter edition would have been more suitable to a collection of Wolfram's results; you must have a very strong interest in cellular automata to really appreciate this book, and enough time and will to read its flat, inflated and repetitive style.	2002-06-21

Though inspired by the Soviet regime, the mechanisms described in the text are suitable for most democratic and non-democratic contemporary societies. More than a prophecy, the novel represents a study of current social dynamics.<br />Pressure for acceptance, mandate for substantial submission in spite of retention of a viewable independence, stratification of people by means of limited privileges are the pillars over which any sufficiently complex group relies upon. The thread develops from the particular situation of the chief character, Winston Smith, depicted against the environment created by the Party to his final struggle and breakdown, when he is forced to turn personal feelings from another person towards the Party, because \\"there is no love, except love of Big Brother, there is no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party\\". Even if the description of interrogatories and tortures is quite detailed and has been sternly represented in some film scenes, I have found two other issues as the most shocking in the novel: the speech of O'Brien (Smith's inquirer), in which he lines out the three stages, \\"learning, understanding and acceptance\\", that Winston is going to pass in order to cure his \\"mental derange and defective memory\\", and the picture of the fade remembrances of Winston's childhood, writing out the merciless way of how selfish a child could be, attached to Winston as an eternal sense of guilt, and which builds a parallel layer, more intimate and personal, about the subject of retaining memory of past events. Maybe Orwell has been too optimistic, because nowadays, as a consequence of media development, learning and understanding are no longer required: it is possible to obtain a direct acceptance.	2002-02-26

Butler, in his novel, developes this theme as a XIX century writer can do. The result is a pleasing reading, made a bit difficult by a slightly obsolete style and too much care of details, which sometimes gives some obstacles to thread. An example of how, about half a century later, a writer could have faced the same subject is given by new world by Huxley. The book is nonetherless quite readable, and an example of the high level tradition in which Butler can stand together with Swift.	2002-01-29

Books	3	5	8	N	N	Well-presented trivialities are an actual asset	Having just been this book a bestseller, when I happened to read it I was very curious about the subject. But I have been quite disappointed by its content. Nothing more than a general autobiography, with some use of elementary economics terms (which can be a bit useful to non-english readers), the general level of the book is comparable to what you can find in many web sites. Not a hint can be found about the real problems and difficulties you meet setting up an activity of your own, and the text deals meanly with what people knows yet. However, I have assigned three stars because it is an easily readable item, and its general meaning, whatever trivial, is undoubtedly true. In a chapter, the author affirms to be a &quot;best-seller&quot;, and not a &quot;best-writer&quot;. I do agree with that statement.	2002-01-02

Maybe I recollect some very similar situations (with the due adaptations), I enjoyed it as a timeless humour, built on the art of the written word and the descriptive ability.

A tale like TGG could be the right answer. Even if I have found the track a bit boring, it is the most representative subject that can be defined American epics. But what I really appreciate about Fitzgerald is his style of writing, the best I have ever met in American and English literature, which also retains its meaningful form (but in that case I have to pay much credit to the translator) in the Italian version. The final short digression about the green light is one of the most often seen quotations.	2001-11-05

You can deceive people by presenting statistical data by mainly two methods: not representative samples and inaccurate calculations, and both are fairly, but not deeply, examined within the text. You can easily realize that the book was written in 1954 (half a century ago!), but it is still a suitable to almost absolute beginners in statistics.	2001-09-13

The book itself is not really better than the latter. Esoteric, repeatitive, obsessively descriptive of mind states and thoughts, there are many good ideas (worms, guilds and sisterhoods, stillsuits and many others) but they are attached to a weak structure and a poor and heavy writing style. To be honest, it is very hard to find a book of good SF that is also a good book, but Dune seems to have a bit less than the average narrative flow. Perhaps, if I were younger, I would be a fan of the Herbert's complex world, but now I have really got the opinion that the book has too many more pages than it needs.	2001-08-30

I would have liked a publication in which briefly summarized process and data issues would be referred to a proper functional, and even technological, architecture of ERP.

It is too entangled with mathematics to be defined an issue about mathematical games, but also fans of games can find out some enjoying items. Because, if much room has been given to proofs and resolutions, the boundary of elementary curiosity never goes out of sight, even if it can sometimes look like a far horizon. It is surely the best book about elementary problems, mathematical games and jokes I have ever read till now, and I have found its language as clear and straight as a non-English reader (like me) usually finds a non-English writer.	2001-08-17

I would have not understood many issues quoted in the book if I had not read before other publications about paradoxes raised by quantum physics. Another very strange choice is to place the chapter about interaction-free measurement at last, while I think this property is a necessary basic for a better understanding of properties of entanglement, above which the whole building of quantum computing relies. So, I wonder how readers without a previous knowledge of basic subjects can have dealt with the problems the book tries to explain. Surely, this book has been written for nonspecialists, as the editorial review states, but, taking into account the poor effort employed in explaining quantum theory, it could have detailed more facets about computing, and simply referencing other textbooks for physics arguments.	2001-05-24

But also in a limited use like that I cannot help recognizing that, even after half a century, this book remains a milestone in integral equations and boundary problems. Deep, clear, and available also to ready-to-use requests, it may seem a bit out of fashion for the light use of geometrical formalism, but also this latter feature makes it to be very strict to the point, if you need to strengthen the theoretical building of numerical calcualtions to be performed.	2001-05-23

Needing to consolidate my background about the subject, I tried to read some publications, that, in spite of editorial reviews, did not satisfy me, being lost about TCP/IP details more than routing issues. This book help me to fix this cultural flaws and represented the definite resource about routing. Maybe I have not been able to fully appreciate it because I am not a network engineer or administrator, and some chapters become too detailed for people having general, and not specialistic, requirements.

The structure underlying chapters, based on a project lifecycle, is very interesting, and surely quite useful to people involved in dwh projects. In spite of many criticisms that have been addressed to Kimball's methods, I believe that this book has a general validity, and can apply, in some ways, to any sort of dwh you are to implement, even if that is not a handbook to fix specific technical issues. It can be also a good textbook to improve general culture about the subject, but in this case I should advise to read it together with The DWH Toolkit, unless you have yet a strong background about dimensional analysis. References to hints and instances add a pleasing value , and avoid too high abstraction. Just a remark: similarly to the previously mentioned book by the same author, the weight of the whole explanation is significantly increased by the inflated language, which many times makes a thorough understanding of the text a bit more hard than the actual complexity of the subject.	2001-04-19

You can find references to interesting subjects in the publication, but just references, and they are shown in a so elementary way that it makes the book suitable for absolute beginners, in data mining, data analysis, and computer science (i.e. first-job employees or financial executives). Walking along the sharp boundary between generality and triviality, the leading way slips many times down the latter side. A book of almost five hundred pages could have afforded to examine more deeply the relating subjects, avoiding repetitions (and sometimes to cut and paste) and the inflated style typical of slide shows. In my experience, this text is close to a lost opportunity, because the good general structure (a path from CRM basics to the most known tools), which I appreciated, has not been supported by a sufficient strength of linked subjects, leaving the book as similar as the skeleton structure of a not completed building. The book could be worth reading, but a reader facing five hundred pages would deserve more.	2001-04-02

Interesting subjects are surely showed, but just lightly touched. Of course, you must agree that a profitable customer is better than a non-profitable one, and that maintaining her/his loyalty makes company to get the related revenue for a longer period. I think also that you may well acknowledge that new technologies do not suit to old organizations. But I am not sure that more than three hundred pages were necessary to say it. I have found some chapters much more interesting than others (for example The Tools For CRM), but if the question for such kind of books is &quot;Which problems is this book helpful to solve to?&quot;, unless you consider a problem preparing a slide presentation, I have  not been able to find any.	2001-03-28

It is a set of practical techniques, with many examples taken from usual business environments. It deals a lot with dimensional modeling (I could say that it is a paper about use of dimension tables in a data warehouse), which is deeply examined, gives a fair series of tips about fact tables, and runs quickly over other issues, with a general speech about functional and technical architectures. The latter subjects have been left in a not well determined state, making the reader to consult other issues for further information. It could be a very useful book in order to understand and to get able to design a dimension modeled DWH. The author's language cannot be considered synthetic, and many times I have been left with the impression that the same things could have been told in much less pages.

To be true, many of mathematical games left me the sound of a deja-vu item, perhaps something reminding me of Sam Loyd's old games. On the other side, I have been surprised by the thinkerobics, that represented also a very good opportunity to train in English language, as I am a foreign reader. But the lack of an underlying structure, and the complete absence of a narrative schema, makes it a mere book of puzzles.

But..., yes there is a &quot;but&quot;. I found very few I had not already read. All the items are very interesting, but there are many other books that present them, and in a very similar way. Of course, I like reading new publications in those fields, in order to avoid them to fade away from my memory, but I should advise this book to people with a strong interest in the subjects, to bear all these repetitions, or enough young so they have not read the many issues published in early 90s. Comparing it to Godel, Escher and Bach, by Hofstadter the difference is clear. Whilst GEB gave me the impression of a new level of knowledge, the book by Flake remains in the common world. Whilst I am sure I would have never been able to write a book such as GEB, I think I would be able to write something not too far from The Computational Beauty of Nature, picking up from all the books I read. That is not negative rating, I do believe that TCBoN is a delightful book, and that is really worth reading, but it shares this feature with many other five-stars books.	2001-01-30

It presents a complete, enough up-to-date, easy, and quick-to-read overview about integration of voice, data and other network facilities. Overall, the author avoids the temptation to dig deeply into protocols (you can easily find tons of papers about) and prefers to clarify and strengthen the structure the different subjects are placed in. Each one is showed in the right time and is given the right room. Oh, I read that this book is very popular among management consultants. But it does not matter, I like it all the same.

US	51842628	RD6NG13MPPSNU	0691057842	407475204	Critical Problems in Physics	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An interesting survey	People with a scientific background, and working far from physics (as me), will find this textbook very interesting. A quick but also deep survey of what physicists are currently doing, in which students of _some_ years ago can recognize subjects whose birth they happened to study. Being my M.S. thesis about Boltzmann equation, I found very fascinating the chapters about diffusion theory, particularly the search for dendrytic solutions of diffusion equation. But whatever the thesis field could have been, the wide variety of described subjects is able to meet interest of every person who happened to study Physics in his/her education.	2000-10-26

It could be useful for those people, professionals and consultants, who need to develop a common &quot;management&quot; language, in order to use it in meeting and convention. In other words, it could be useful to Dilbert's boss or CEO. To other people, now it could have mainly a historical interest.	2000-10-20

It is not an easy-to-read book, and its fragmented style, which requires a thorough attention, does not help the reader. I remember that in university math courses it was said that \\"economists learnt how to use mathematics, whilst biologists did not\\", and I believe that this book is a good example of that (as a comparison term, I found much clearer the papers by Maynard Smith). But it is really worth reading it and facing these difficulties, and its price, compared to the deepness of its content, is quite low.	2000-10-17

You can read the book by Tanenbaum Computer  networks to find it out.  Which requirements have I to meet to design a network? And the book  Practical Computer Network Analysis and Design by McCabe is good for this  task. How can I design it in order to integrate required services and  choose the right equipment to build it? And the book by Taylor does NOT  provide an answer, not even useful hints. Maybe it tries to, maybe it is  obsolete, the author takes more than five hundred pages (plus appendixes)  to say actually nothing but a long and never ending chat, in which many  subjects are often repeated, using a vague language. More details are  explained about protocols, but, despite the title of the book and inside  chapters, very little is said about their relation to network design.  However, you can find almost everywhere publications providing any detail  you need about protocols, so you don't need to purchase a textbook about  network design. And a bit more, but just a bit, can be found in the last  chapters about bridging and routing (that is why I think the book deserves  two stars instead of one). But for these last subjects, in my opinion, the  book provides you material to speak about networks in a pub in the same way  other people speak about sport or girls. But nothing else.	2000-09-07

The textbook, actually a collection of lectures, provides a lot of material and examples, and it tries to lead the reader from the basics of subject to the applications of wavelets. Despite of the wide range  presented by the chapters, the high reciprocal independence and the  completness of proposed path, as an introductory book I would prefer the  classical &quot;Ten Lectures on Wavelets&quot;, even if Benedetto-Frazier  work could be more suitable to get at-a-glance what people are doing (i.e.  were doing at the moment of publication) with wavelets.	2000-07-31

But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer),  but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been  currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain,  derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would  have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.	2000-07-31

Any other one about the subject I tried to read was not able to reach the same level, or also something comparable. Too deep the gap between LOTR and  the others, and, maybe, too difficult to reach the same thouroughness of  its structure, both from philology and novellistic point of view.  The  author is able to branch the story into different threads, to deal properly  with them, and then to join them again (people with scientific background  cannot help liking this &quot;unifying&quot; effort). The end is a bit sad,  leaving the memory of a world that no longer exists (or that have never  existed): a metaphor of human growth.	2000-07-17

The author has been able to  lead the reader from simple and usual concepts to advanced and up-to-date  unified theories. Easy to understand, but it leaves to the reader the view  of the large front modern physics is facing	2000-07-17

It is really a very good book, and even if I agree with the definition of  &quot;pedagogical jewel&quot; given to the quantum pinball example, I would  not define this textbook an introductory one, even if a non-specialist can  read it without many difficulties. I read it several years after my  studies, and it represented to me a good and amusing opportunity to refresh  or to learn subjects I didn't remember any more or I didn't meet in  university course.  And taking into account its low price, it is really  worth purchasing this book.	2000-07-07

I really appreciated the  chapter &quot;Fractal Functions and Wavelets&quot;, a good description of  links beetween wavelets and fractals.	2000-06-25

A rigorous, but not boring, path through the bases of logics. Since the first time I read, almost twenty years ago, it had no way to gather dust on my bookshelf, you  can always find the opportunity to peek some subjects from it.. The most  vivid explanation of what a formal system is, and the first time I met the  word \\"fractal\\". A strong and beautiful structure, connecting Western and  Eastern philosophies, computer science and math, physics and complexity.  The best example of how Science and Art can be seen as the same thing.	2000-06-23

An easy answer to question &quot;How can I  generate a fractal image with my PC?&quot;, from brownian motion to Julia  sets. A must for reader interested in fractals (a bit out-of-fashion but  still very interesting field).	2000-06-22

A good example of multidisciplinarity and a bridge between theoretical and practical studies. The author does not avoid mathematics, allowing accuracy  and complete explanations, and does not exceed, making the book readable to  beginners.	2000-06-22

Even if it shows the structure of lecture notes, it maintains a strong cohesion, embracing  in a single context different fields, such as computer graphics and  statistical physics.	2000-06-22
