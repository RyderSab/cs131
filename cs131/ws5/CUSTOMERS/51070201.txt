US	51070201	R19LR3FM5K6SMS	0786713143	898854010	Shanghai Station	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Bull looks like he's kicking off another rollicking series	Bartle Bull proved that he could spin an exotic, thrilling yarn with his North African novels (\\"The White Rhino Hotel,\\" \\"A Cafe on the Nile,\\" and \\"The Devil's Oasis\\").  These novels were not \\"Great Literature,\\" but they were fascinating tales of derring-do, high romance, and dastardly villainy set in the romantic WWI - WWII era.  Creating strong characters and vividly capturing the harsh beauty of North Africa (as well as the seedy aspects of city life in such cesspools as Cairo), Bull transported the reader to a world he knows exceedingly well from first-hand knowledge. <br /> <br />In \\"Shanghai Station,\\" Bull launches what appears to be an exciting new series of novels, as \\"Station\\" bears all the hallmarks of a \\"kick-off\\" first novel.   <br /> <br />The novel opens in Northwestern Russia at the outbreak of the Communist Revolution in 1917.  Our hero, Alexander Karlov, is the only son of the noble soldier, Count Karlov.  Alexander must help his mother and twin sister Katia flee via the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok, and then to Shanghai, to meet their father, who is off fighting the Communists.  Tragedy strikes as the train is attacked by Communists, and there is murder and a kidnapping. <br /> <br />Alexander arrives in Shanghai with a shattered leg and a vengeful heart . . . along with the aromatic tobacco pipe of the novel's arch-villain, the Communist fanatic Victor Polyak.  Reunited with his father, Alexander and the Count escape to Shanghai, which at this time is the Casablanca of the Orient.  Thousands of Europeans populate this city, one of the largest in the world, with official settlements.  Alexander and his father must scrape out a living in an unforgiving cityscape of cutthroats, prostitutes, thieves, warlords, corrupt government officials, and the Chinese gangs known as the Triads.  They meet friends and foes, and it's not always clear whether a friend is indeed a friend, or if a foe is actually a foe. <br /> <br />At the same time, the younggorgeous American Jessica James, daughter of Presbyterian missionaries, is trying to help the embryonic Communist Revolution in China.  Zealous, motiviated by classic \\"American Christianity,\\" Jessica (or \\"Jesse,\\" as she likes to be called), is swept up in forces she doesn't entirely understand.  To say that she undergoes a harsh maturation process would be an understatement.   <br /> <br />By the end of the novel, the reader is breathless from the triumphs and travails of our heroes and villains.  The final scene, a wake for a beloved character, concludes with a toast \\"To Shanghai!\\"  It is a toast the evokes the hope that Bull will continue to explore this rich city and his band of intrepid characters, and that he does so soon. <br /> <br />In a novel that ranges from the Mongolian steppe to the most intimate pleasure rooms of a Shanghai brothel, \\"Shanghai Station\\" transports the reader to a distant, romantic, lethal world.  Bull captivates with his description of the ravenous \\"debt collectors\\" used by a Shanghai crime lord to teach lessons that last a lifetime as much as with his lush descriptions of the repellent Russian Prince Krupotkin, a distant cousin of Alexander's who runs a thriving casino in Shanghai.   <br /> <br />From the author's notes in the book, this novel is intensely personal.  His father and uncles spent a lot of time in Shanghai and had a close friendship with a royal Russian.  The Bull family's devotion to the art of fencing also comes through, as does their fascination with the most noble of animals, the horse.  Bull concedes that he has made several deviations from the historical record, and that's fine -- we're not reading Bartle Bull's novels as a surrogate for actual history. We're reading it for thrills, chills, laughter and tears.  And Bull brings the goods fast and furious.   <br /> <br />Check it out, and let's hope that Bull can continue the series with more novels to come.	2005-10-13
US	51070201	R3EHMO5KT9SL34	1585674184	306956471	The Sisters	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Littell's masterful tale of revenge, deceit, espionage, and honor	Robert Littell's novel, \\"The Sisters,\\" sets the high water mark for espionage thrillers.  Brief at just over 300 pages, convoluted with plots within subterfuges within deceits within double-crosses, and populated with a murderer's row of spies and assassins, \\"The Sisters\\" thrills with its expertise as it awes with its audacity. <br /> <br />The titular Sisters are actually two men, Carroll and Francis, \\"the sisters death and night,\\" who work for the Central Intelligence Agency.  Their job is simple - to plot.  Littell wrote this book during the Reagan era, so the natural target of the Sisters' gigantic, non-linear minds is the Soviet Union - even though Littell never specifically mentions the year during which the novel is set, it's perfectly clear that we're at the height of the Cold War.  As chock full of idiosyncrasies as they are brilliance, the Sisters contrive the perfect crime . . . a crime that will shock the world and for which the blame will fall squarely on the U.S.S.R.   <br /> <br />This dastardly plot requires the unwitting assistance of one of Littell's great creations, the Potter.  An aged dwarf living out his years with his shrewish wife, the Potter is a now-disgraced member of the Soviet intelligentsia.  Once a highly successful \\"novator,\\" the Potter trained \\"sleepers,\\" who were undercover agents who could live anywhere in the world, waiting to be \\"activated\\" for a \\"job.\\"  Betrayed by his own government, the Potter has lost all his sleepers except one . . . his last, best Sleeper.  The Sleeper who is the son the Potter never had. <br /> <br />But the Sisters have a reach that extends well beyond the Iron Curtain, and soon the Sleeper has been set on a path to commit the Sisters' crime.  The Potter, who can pierce the murkiest of hidden motives, understands that his cherished student is at great risk, both to himself and for his country.  And in a classic thriller's plot development, \\"only the Potter can stop him.\\"   <br /> <br />Demonstrating a firm command of both the \\"tricks of the trade\\" as well as life in the Soviet Union, Littell keeps the reader flipping the pages as the Sleeper gets closer and closer to committing the crime of the century.  Littell also masterfully doles out the hints to the reader so that while never explicitly explained, the Sleeper's (and the Sisters') intended crime becomes monstrously, horrifyingly clear.  (If you don't recognize it at first, never fear, you will.) <br /> <br />A must for fans of espionage thrillers, \\"The Sisters\\" demands to be read and refuses to be put down.  Building on a solid foundation of well-drawn characters in an exhilarating plot, \\"The Sisters\\" builds to a crescendo of revenge that will cause the reader to return to Page 1, eager to spot all the author's clues that led to this shocking yet logical conclusion.  All in all, a definitive thriller. <br />	2005-10-06
US	51070201	RK83HLS97R5GD	0060084049	225201186	Cuba Libre	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Ruffians galore as America invades Cuba	Elmore Leonard's \\"Cuba Libre\\" bears an inapt title.  \\"Cuba Libre\\" implies that Leonard has created some of his trademark cowboys and thieves getting caught up in a political revolution.  To a certain extent that's true, as the book indeed has some classic Leonardesque characters, and there is a revolution in the wake of the U.S.S. Maine being blown up, but the war that racks the Cuban countryside rarely rises above an inconvenience (or an opportunity) for Leonard's cast of ne'er-do-wells.   <br /> <br />Fortunately, a possibly inapt title is a forgivable sin.  We read Mr. Leonard's novels for their wicked dialogue and hard-edged yet open-hearted heroes (along with the hard-edged and hard-hearted villains).  \\"Cuba Libre\\" has these traits in spades.   <br /> <br />Ostensibly the \\"hero\\" of the tale, Ben Tyler runs both horses and guns to Cuba on the eve of the Maine's destruction.  The imminent war sets devious wheels a-turning, as does Tyler's instant infatuation with Amelia, a spoiled rich girl from New Orleans.  Problem is, Amelia's beau is Rollie Boudreaux, an amoral business tycoon from America who uses ruthlessness to advance both his business and romantic interests.   <br /> <br />Leonard's characters hop-scotch through a byzantine plot that involves robbery, murder, kidnapping, extortion, torture, false imprisonment, jailbreaks, political revolution, and more than a wee bit of plain old thievery.  Along the way, our heroes and villains meet other characters of unknown morals but a well-demonstrated ability to kill at the drop of a hat.  For Tyler, it is easy to come to Cuba having never killed a man only to discover that he has quite the talent for it.  <br /> <br />Perhaps not one of Leonard's great novels (I have not read enough of him to judge), \\"Cuba Libre\\" offers a hardboiled plot that feels surprisingly truncated.  The possibilities revolutionary Cuba offers for an author of Leonard's capabilities seem endless, and yet \\"Cuba Libre\\" really does not go veryfar with them.  This book, for example, completely lacks the scope of James Ellroy's \\"American Tabloid\\" or \\"The Cold Ten Thousand,\\" even though the locale offers such a potentially broad canvas.  <br /> <br />An easy book to like, \\"Cuba Libre\\" offers a fun read, as far as it goes, although you will be a bit disappointed that it doesn't try to go further.	2005-09-30

Power in Wagner's Ring Cycle and in Us- A Jungian-Feminist Perspective (Jung on the Hudson Book Series)	Books	3	9	15	N	N	Basic Intro to Themes and Plot of Wagner's Ring	Jean Shinoda Bolen's book on Wagner is appropriately titled -  with a complete absence of poetry, it is what it is.  The only amendment I could propose would be to add the phrase \\"A Brief Introduction to\\" at the beginning.   <br /> <br />Full disclosure -- I found Ms. Bolen's book after my first \\"work-through\\" of the Karajan recording of the complete Ring, and I was eager to delve deeper into Wagner's titanic opera.  Bolen's work is fine, as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. <br /> <br />A brief book (around 200 pages, with very large type), \\"Ring of Power\\" restricts itself to the visual and textual aspects of Wagner's opera.  Divided into four main chapters -- one for each of the operas of the Ring -- \\"Ring of Power\\" provides a brief plot synopsis of each opera followed by an exploration of some of the Jungian themes contained in the opera.  The synopses are workmanlike and relatively thorough textual analyses, and I can safely say that I have a clearer picture of the action than after listening to the opera on CD. <br /> <br />The exploration of Jungian themes is a bit difficult to swallow at times.  Bolen relates many of the ideas Wagner explores (sacrificing love for power, the problems of patriarchy, the insidious impact of child abuse, etc.) to her current practice as clinical psychologist (or some other mental health professional -- sorry, Ms. Bolen).  It is rather jarring to juxtapose one of the most titanic, mythic operas to some of the \\"crises\\" Ms. Bolen witnesses in her practice, which seem just so mundane.  Ms. Bolen defends her analogies and her theories as much as she needs to in this brief work, but even this solidly-written book cannot be considered to have the heft of actual \\"proof.\\"   <br /> <br />The most jarring omission from \\"Ring of Power\\" is a near-complete absence of any discussion of the role of music.  We are talking opera here, and one of the defining works of the genre.  Wagner's musical achievements in the Ring have been documented over and over, and Ms. Bolen virtually ignores this subject.  The end result is that she reduces Wagner's Ring to a story -- a powerful one, to be sure, but an opera is so much more than its storyline.   <br /> <br />For those, like me, who are new to this wonder that is Wagner's Ring, Ms. Bolen's book is a fine exploration of some of the basic plot points and themes.  I am no student of Jung, so I really wasn't too jazzed about the analogies to Ms. Bolen's patients, although some were more interesting than others.  However, the scope of this book is too limited for it to qualify as a suitable \\"companion\\" to the Ring or an exploration of all the ideas -- both textual and musical -- contained in this wondrous creation.	2005-09-29
US	51070201	R2UOIG9Z7JWQF	0743244508	663516219	The Battle of Salamis: The Naval Encounter That Saved Greece -- and Western Civilization	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Rip-roaring history breathes life into centuries-old battle	Professional historians invariably render the ancient world even more distant and murky than the mere passage of time could achieve on its own.  Relying heavily on the footnote and quotations in Ancient Greek or Latin, these giant intellects generally write for each other, the general populace be damned.   <br /> <br />Barry Strauss gives these historians a stylish rebuke with \\"The Battle of Salamis.\\"  Thanks to Strauss's command of the ancient sources (particularly Herodotus and Aeschylus) and a healthy respect for common sense, \\"The Battle of Salamis\\" qualifies as a solid general history and also a darn fun read.   <br /> <br />Strauss heavily relies on the ancient sources, quoting Herodotus, Aeschylus, and even minor figures such as Timotheus where appropriate.  Yet Strauss is not interested in an exegesis of these sources -- he focuses on telling an important story.  \\"Salamis\\" focuses on the clash of East and West in a conflict where only a genius could save the West.   <br /> <br />Fortunately for the West, it had such a genius in Themistocles, an Athenian politician, braggart, and admiral.  Strauss understandably chooses Themistocles as the primary vehicle for telling this tale, and the wily Athenian's audacity keeps the reader hooked.  Opposed not only by the Persian navy but also by many of the fractious Greek allies, Themistocles used deceit, daring, and wit to convince both friend and foe to fight on water of his choosing.  And these heroic efforts made all the difference. <br /> <br />Strauss leavens \\"Salamis\\" with heavy dollops of common sense.  Too many historians write as if they have never left the library.  Strauss describes the winds and waters of various Greek locales and how Themistocles used them to his advantage . . . and how the Persians failed to appreciate them.  By writing as one who has actually been on board ship in the Aegean, Strauss gives \\"Salamis\\" a healthy dose of honesty.  Strauss also refutes his primary sources where he feels it necessary.  <br /> <br />Writing in a brisk prose, often using the present tense to describe events around 2,500 years old, Strauss never belabors a point but keeps the action moving.  Offering reasonably detailed character studies of important players, \\"Salamis\\" is detailed without getting clogged up.  Clocking in at under 300 pages, \\"Salamis\\" will not bore the reader or overstay its welcome. <br /> <br />Far from a paean to Themistocles and the Greeks, \\"Salamis\\" points out the numerous ironies of the Greek victory.  Athens emerges as the champion of democracy, yet soon pursues antidemocratic imperial ambitions similar to the Persians.  Sparta and Athens join forces to defeat a common foe, only to fight a much more destructive war in the immediate future.  And the Persian empire views Salamis as a minor incident in its uninterrupted imperial administration, which is made even more irrelevant once Themistocles, ostracized from Athens, becomes a governor of a Persian province. <br /> <br />While surely not the most \\"scholarly\\" work on Ancient Greece one could find, \\"Salamis\\" is also one of the most readable, enjoyable and informative.  While perhaps the scope of the book is too limited to elevate it to a \\"must read,\\" its style and wit make it highly, highly recommended.	2005-09-26
US	51070201	RRNL3R0VECMIL	0312336578	326532083	The War at Troy	Books	3	11	11	N	N	Clarke places Troy in proper context, but prose often clunks	Lindsay Clarke takes on a daring assingment with \\"The War at Troy.\\"  By taking on Greek myths that have been the cornerstone of \\"Western Civ\\" since, well, the creation of \\"Western Civ,\\" you had best be prepared for some intense criticism.   <br /> <br />From an academic perspective, Clarke has done a magnificent job of placing the Trojan War, most widely known to modern audiences through Homer's \\"Iliad,\\" in a logical context.  One of the problems of \\"The Iliad\\" is that it begins in the tenth year of the war, and there's not a lot of time spent on back story.  Clarke's story of the Trojan War kicks off during the formative years of the conflict, and we get to see a lot of the world that Paris and Helen brought to the brink of destruction with passionate affair.   <br /> <br />In marked contrast to the recent summer blockbuster, \\"Troy,\\" Clarke still finds room for the Gods in \\"The War at Troy.\\"  Paris is forced to choose \\"the fairest\\" between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, and his choice of Aphrodite casts his doom.  On a personal note, I was hoping that Clarke would get deeper into how Athena, supposedly the Goddess of Wisdom, was able to be out-debated by the sexpot Aphrodite.  The Goddess of Love makes one heck of a sales pitch, but shouldn't Athena have been able to anticipate Aphrodite's tactics and trump them somehow?  Obviously not, or we'd have no story . . . but I digress. <br /> <br />With the Gods taking generally a back seat in this story (Zeus barely factors in at all), Clarke spends a lot of time putting the Trojan War into the \\"real world.\\"  We learn a lot about how the Argive spent the first nine years of the war (it wasn't all spent on the Plains of Troy), the political scheming of Odysseus that bound so many Argives to Menelaus's cause, and the young life of Achilles.  These are all strong points, and Clarke's deviations from established myths seem appropriate (for example, the Centaurs who raise Achilles are not half-men, half-horse, but instead barbarians who spend a lot of time with horses, consequently gaining an equine odor).   <br /> <br />Clarke's novel only really stumbles when he gets to the final year of the war.  Despite all the storytelling that has gone before, we still don't know that much about Hector, the most noble of the Trojans.  Instead, we know a great deal about the craven Paris, but I was hoping to have a better picture of the Trojan hero rather than the Trojan coward.  Similarly, while we spent a lot of time with Achilles as a child, we really don't know that much about him as an adult and his Myrmidons.  Clarke \\"tells\\" us that Achilles is a mighty warrior, but doesn't really give us all that much meat to digest on that front prior to the war.  <br /> <br />While Clarke drops some delicious hints of future events (Odysseus on several occasions pines for his home and wife in Ithaca, having no idea of his travails to come, Cassandra occasionally pops up with unheeded prophecies, etc.), but the novel occasionally grinds under some awkward prose.  For example, Hector offers up this tooth-grinding line, \\"He (meaning Paris) freely concedes that his actions is the cause of this great quarrel, and has no wish to see many good men die needlessly on his account.\\"  Yeesh.  And I wish I could say that this was the only passage that abused the ear, but unfortunately there are more. <br /> <br />Clarke is no Bernard Cornwell, much less Cormac McCarthy, when it comes to describing the battlefield.  He does so in a workmanlike way, but there are few passages in \\"The War at Troy\\" that set the heart to pounding.  Indeed, his romantic scenes are better, but still do not reach any fantastic heights.  This wouldn't be a huge problem (he's good, not great), but again, he's writing about one of the fundamental stories in Western literature, and the bar is set pretty high.   <br /> <br />The only emotion Clarke nails is anguish.  This is important in a story of war, loss and betrayal.  But it would have helped ifClarke's range extended to other emotions as well.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"The War at Troy\\" is a good read if you're looking to flesh out your understanding of \\"The Iliad\\" and the Greek myths that surround it.  Clarke's scholarship is much better than his prose, and while \\"The War at Troy\\" rarely sings, it does <br />does tell a darn good story.   <br /> <br />A worthy read for fans of Greek myth, to be sure. <br />	2005-09-23

Some of these are obvious (e.g., use a readable typeface), while others are more nuanced (e.g., delete perhaps the legal drafter's favorite legalism, \\"provided that\\").  Each suggestion urges the writer toward a simple yet difficult goal -- be a good writer so that your reader doesn't have to work so darn hard to understand you. <br /> <br />As everyone knows, a simple manual of rules can be maddeningly dull and preachy.  Garner has enlivened his book by including a number of practical exercises so that the reader can put these guidelines into practice before the next memo or brief.  These exercises range from \\"basic\\" to \\"advanced,\\" and are well worth the time. <br /> <br />After reading this book (and attending Mr. Garner's one-day seminar), I submit that this book should be required reading for every One-L and associate.	2005-09-19
US	51070201	R2BIOIHD0QEL99	0786709901	823253654	The Devil's Oasis: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Thirlling Series Continues, but Some Developments Seem Too Familiar	Bartle Bull's series of North African novels can fairly be characterized as a \\"rip-roaring yarn.\\"  From the chaotic closing days of WWI (\\"The White Rhino Hotel\\") to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 (\\"A Cafe on the Nile\\") to the outbreak of WWII (\\"The Devil's Oasis\\"), Bull has taken a cast of beloved characters and dropped them pell-mell into some of the most exotic and dangerous (and therefore romantic) circumstances possible. <br /> <br />What brings this series alive is Bull's ability to capture the uniquely North African flavors of his cherished setting.  It is obvious that Bull has spent quite a bit of time in the desert and on safari in North Africa, not to mention a lot of time \\"recharging\\" himself at various seedy and sophisticated bars and hotels.  Writing with a quick, terse prose, Bull is more likey to spend more time describing the sights, sounds, and smells of a busy riverfront than he would describing the psychological torments of his characters -- a remarkably stoic, macho crowd.  <br /> <br />Again, the one completely unique character in Bull's novels is the Goan dwarf, Olivio Alavdedo.  Rising from servant in the first novel to wealthy landowner and entrepreneur, Alavedo confronts both his physical limitations and impending death (due to health complications) as opportunities.  With a mind as cruel as it is cunning, Alavedo concocts schemes of conquest and vengeance that are haunting, devastating, and completely original.  He stands in stark contrast to the what-you-see-is-what-you-get machismo of Englishman/gypsy/hunter Anton Rider and German/African/hunter/farmer Ernst von Decken -- both of whom are great characters in their own right. <br /> <br />I have given both \\"Hotel\\" and \\"Cafe\\" five stars for their sheer audacity -- I have completely enjoyed both books. I still enjoyed \\"Oasis,\\" but I have to confess that some of Bull's plot developments in \\"Oasis\\" seem overly similar to plot developments in the first two novels.  Alavedo once again faces numerous assassination attempts -- we've been here before.  Gwenn Rider has once again left Anton for a Euro-trash villain who is destined for a horrible comeuppance.  Anton once again finds himself challenged to express his true feelings, and he undergoes horrible physical punishment while trying to do the right thing.  And there are other plot developments that come straight from the first two books. <br /> <br />All of these plot similarities derive from the fact that our characters haven't changed all that much.  Alavedo continues to court enemies (this time in the corrupt world of Egyptian antiquities), so it's natural that he be marked for trouble. And Gwenn and Anton Rider, despite their intense love, are too different to spend every day next to each other.  But still, there's a certain sense of repetition in \\"Oasis\\" that keeps the novel from a five-star rating. <br /> <br />Fortunately, despite this misgiving, \\"Oasis\\" brings the goods as far as thrills and chills are concerned.  Ernst von Decken allies himself with Erwin Rommel during Rommel's African campaign.  Anton joins the British Long Range Patrol Group, charged with scouting and sabotage.  (Ernst and Anton also find themselves confronting the loss of their long friendship, thanks to Anton's \\"behavior\\" with Ernst's young American wife, Harriet.)  Anton's and Gwenn's elder son, Wellington, also joins the British army in North Africa and takes on Rommel and the Luftwaffe.  And there is much, much more.   <br /> <br />Chalk up another sterling adventure for Bartle Bull and his series of African novels.  While it's clear from the conclusion of \\"Oasis\\" that another novel (at least) is forthcoming, perhaps it's good that Bull has briefly left this series for another novel, \\"Shanhai Station.\\"  Maybe this break will give him some inspiration for some unanticipated and original crises to befall his romantic band of killers, schemers, and lovers.	2005-09-14
US	51070201	R2OKHZ6AB46P7P	0684871254	601572736	The Honorary Consul: A Novel (Simon & Schuster Classics)	Books	4	17	17	N	N	Terrific Range of Characters in Desperate, Hopeless Plot	\\"The Honorary Consul\\" is the first Graham Greene novel I've read, and it is easy to see why Greene has earned so many devoted fans and seemingly over-the-top superlatives over his long career.   <br /> <br />Based on this novel, Greene's strength seems to be creating a rich cast of characters, full of different tics, scars, dreams, virtues, and flaws, and dropping them into a plot of balanced tragedy and farce.  By stirring great ingredients into a delicious recipe, Greene created a novel to savour and one, I would bet, improves with each reading. <br /> <br />Set in an anonymous border town just on the Argentine side of Paraguay, \\"The Honorary Consul\\" focuses on the hapless, accidental kidnapping of Charley Fortnum, the titular honorary consul.  A band of revolutionaries, lethally inept, swipe the British Fortnum instead of their target, the American ambassador, whom they wanted to exchange for political prisoners in the Paraguayan dictatorship nearby.  Unfortunately for the kidnappers, Fortnum's title is more impressive than his station, and nobody is all that eager to save Fortnum, much less give in to the kidnappers' demands.   <br /> <br />Further adding to the travesty of the situation, Fortnum's only connection to the outside world is Dr. Plarr, a half-British, half Argentinian physician who is also having an affair with Fortnum's wife, a former prostitute.  Plarr, whose father vanished into the Paraguayan prison system years ago, is a man incapable of emotion -- when it comes to relationships, he's good at the physics but not the chemistry.   <br /> <br />Plarr struggles to help the innocent Fortnum escape his looming fate -- if ten political prisoners are not released from Paraguay, the kidnappers will shoot Fortnum.  Through his efforts both with the kidnappers and with several possible saviors, Plarr meets and interacts with a host of characters whose range of quirks and passions would be at home in a Casablanca cafe.   <br /> <br />Greene writes with aneconomic, spare prose that is nevertheless powerful, often using dialogue and soliloquies to advance the story rather than long-winded descriptions of setting.  Clocking in at under 300 pages, \\"The Honorary Consul\\" is a riveting read that probably goes too fast on the first read.  I plan on putting it aside for a few months before taking it up again . . . I'm sure I'll catch a bit more meaning the second time around, but there was plenty for the first trip through.   <br /> <br />A dark, occasionally depressing novel of lost opportunities, false passions, and the ultimate quest for truth, \\"The Honorary Consul\\" is a heck of a read.  Check it out.	2005-09-09

Rather, the pages fly by as spare dialogue dominates the work and keeps the action moving forward.  I finished the book in a bare fraction of the time that it took for me to read McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" -- which I admit was slow going.  But while I enjoyed \\"No Country,\\" I couldn't help but feel that I had missed something.    So I dove back into the novel for a second go-round, and the second reading took much longer than the first.  Without giving an exegesis of the novel, let me just say that certain passages, such as a dialogue in a diner shortly before a shootout, or a scene where a key character almost inexplicably returns to a location visited previously, are much more pregnant with meaning the more you savour McCarthy's words.  The brevity of the dialogue forces the reader to linger over the multiple meanings and implications of the words, and to consider what was not said as much as what was.      While not as titanic as \\"Blood Meridian\\" or as operatic as the Border Trilogy, \\"No Country\\" is vintage McCarthy.  Look for the usual evocative descriptions of the Southwestern landscape, and as usual McCarthy's \\"action\\" scenes are among the best in the business thanks to his spare prose.  The book does not arrive at the anticipated climax one would expect after the opening chapters, and principal characters have unexpected fates.      Sheriff Bell, the aging narrator of much of the novel, is a fully realized character, and his ruminations on justice and the state of the world are worthy expressions and analyses of the complex, often bizarre world we live in.  Bell speaks for himself, but when you understand where he's coming from, his words gain a certain universality.      I can't say that \\"No Country\\" is as good as \\"Blood Meridian,\\" but that doesn't keep me from giving this five stars.  For one thing, it doesn't have anything approaching \\"Meridian's\\" maddeningly confusing epilogue attached to it.  While I wish a few items had been included in the novel, I trust McCarthy to leave out what should be left out, and to let his choices work for me.  Very few authors have earned, or deserve, that kind of trust.	2005-08-31
US	51070201	R1SCUJXM75IYMB	0786707984	831620043	The White Rhino Hotel: A Novel	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Period Details Elevate Wanton, Violent Tale of Colonial Kenya	Bartle Bull's \\"The White Rhino Hotel\\" is the first novel in his series of historical fiction about colonial Africa (\\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" and \\"The Devil's Oasis\\" follow), and \\"White Rhino\\" gets the series off to a rip-roaring start. <br /> <br />Starting in 1919 as WWI closes, \\"White Rhino\\" follows a varied band of intrepid heroes, trusty sidekicks, and dastardly villains as the British start to assert their control over Kenya.  Thanks to British arrogance and a fundamental misunderstanding of Africa, chaos abounds.  Fortunes can be made and lost for the daring, the cunning, and the ruthless. <br /> <br />Anton Rider is arguably the \\"hero\\" if the tale, and he is a young English gypsy seeking his fortune on the Dark Continent.  En route to Africa, he meets Gwenn Llewelyn, the beautiful Welsh ambulance driver who is heading to Kenya to meet her fiance, Alan, who suffers cruelly from his wounds sustained in the British army but still dreams of starting a farming life in Kenya.  Adam Penfold is a small-time English lord who thinks he runs the White Rhino Hotel in Kenya, which is the focal point for much of the tale as the local bastion of European civilization.  But the hotel is actually run by Olivio Alovedo, Bull's greatest creation, a dwarf majordomo who schemes triumphs and vendettas while having some of the kinkiest sex imaginable. <br /> <br />As the story follows these characters and several others through the struggles to start a new life in Africa, Bull displays a commanding knowledge of the unique pulse of African life.  Regardless of whether he's describing a lonely safari far from the trammels of civilization, the smelly optimism on a steamer ship from England to Africa, or the melting pot of various nationalities, agendas, and ambitions of the players in the White Rhino Bar, Bull transports the reader to another time and place with effortless efficiency. <br /> <br />That he peppers his story with copious amounts of sex and violence is a plus, for Bull is spinning a yarn here.  Look for sly seductions, profound loves, heart-breaking losses, and above it all, sudden swift death that can reach out for anyone at any time.  The pages will fly by as you get deeper and deeper into Bull's world, and you care more and more for his rag-tag bunch of misfits and explorers. <br /> <br />The only reason that I don't give \\"White Rhino\\" five stars is that I want to distinguish it from \\"A Cafe on the Nile,\\" which is in the same vein as \\"White Rhino,\\" but is an even more epic and enjoyable read.	2005-08-24

Rowling's sixth entry in the beloved Harry Potter series, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\\" is hard-edged, somber, and a perfect set-up for the climactic Book 7. <br /> <br />Book Six is a novel of major transitions for Harry as he rapidly approaches his seventeenth birthday, 17 being the age of adulthood in the wizarding world.  Harry has largely outgrown his earlier passions of Quidditch (even though he's team Captain), and the question of who wins the House Cup isn't even an afterthought.  True, Harry struggles to master his inner \\"beast,\\" which rages every time he spies Ginny Weasley holding hands with her boyfriend Dean, but even the trials and tribulations of young love can't distract Harry for long . . .  <br /> <br />For Voldemort is waiting.   <br /> <br />The wizarding world has been forced to acknowledge that the Dark Lord has returned, and that Harry was right all along in Book 5.  Magical war has erupted, and even Muggles are being killed -- giving Rowling the opportunity to write one of her best chapters ever, where the Muggle Prime Minister of England has an unexpected meeting with Minister Fudge.   <br /> <br />In this time of war, Dumbledore steps up his pursuit of Voldemort, and he enlists Harry as his right hand.  Through several flashbacks using the Pensieve, Dumbledore and Harry learn more and more about how the young Tom Riddle evolved into the evil master he became, and the dark, evil steps he took to ensure his immortality.  Although the flashbacks aren't the most dramatic scenes ever (after all, nothing *new* is going to happen), they do impart a bunch of important information that makes the entire storyline much deeper and richer.  Just as \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" was vital to the \\"Star Wars\\" series by explaining Darth Vader's relationship with Luke, \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" is essential for explaining just who this dastardly villain is and where he came from, and how he and Dumbledore came to hate each other so fiercely. <br /> <br />Still, Harry is a student and must go to class.  He receives unexpected help from the titular \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" through an old potions book.  Harry's academic success is a wee problem for Hermione Granger, as her spot atop the academic pedestal is challenged for the first time . . . and Hermione is already on edge, what with Ron Weasley \\"snogging\\" another gal with alarming frequency. <br /> <br />And just what is that spoiled prat Malfoy up to anyway?  No good, to be sure . . .  <br /> <br />As you can see, Rowling has a lot of balls up in the air with this novel, and she keeps them flying fast and furious.  Avoid all spoilers -- the twists and turns of this book may not be entirely unexpected, but you should let Rowling spin her tale for you rather than getting a cheap summary from somewhere else. <br /> <br />Fans of Harry Potter have probably already read this novel (more than once).  If you're late to the Harry Potter series, rest assured that the light-hearted kids' books have matured into darker fare, and if you're over 30 you won't feel quite so silly reading a \\"kid's book\\" if you're caught with this one on the Stairmaster at the gym.  (Of course, these books do not stand alone - you must read the other five first.  Trust me, it ain't a chore!) <br /> <br />Rowling has done something amazing by spinning this series out over so many books and keeping it fresh and vibrant.  Here's to Book 7 and the final battle of good versus evil!  Long live Harry!	2005-08-15

David Ball's first novel, \\"Empires of Sand,\\" is an explosion of adventure, history, and good old fashioned storytelling.  Spannin several years and two continents, \\"Empires\\" tells an epic-yet-intimate story of family caught betwixt and between two dynamic cultures. <br /> <br />Most of the first half of the novel is set in Paris in the 1860s.  The Count Henri deVries has shocked French society by marrying a beauty from the Sahara:  Serena, a princess of the Tuareg, the infamous \\"blue men\\" of the Sahara.  Their son, Moussa, romps across the Parisian countryside with his beloved cousin Paul, son to an overly proud military man and an overly ambitous socialite.   <br /> <br />Together, Paul and Moussa get into any number of scrapes, although it's not clear whether a mammoth wild boar is more dangerous than their fourth-grade teacher, a caustic nun named Sister Godrick.  Or, quite possibly, the most virulent threat to their happiness is a deceitful bishop who sits astride Paris like a monstrous, bloated spider, spinning webs and dispensing poison.   <br /> <br />Paris is shattered when the French allow themselves to be goaded into a war they cannot win against the Prussians, and some of the novel's most powerful scenes come from the epic Prussian siege of Paris.  After considerable mayhem, duplicity, treachery, and a dollop of murder, tragedy befalls the deVries family and the action shifts to the Sahara and leaps forward several years. <br /> <br />Now living among his mother's desert people, Moussa learns a truth that was prophesied when his mother first announced her devotion to Henri deVries -- he will forever be exiled from both his French and Tuareg heritage.  While Ball has some fun showing the Tuareg reactions to some of Moussa's eccentricities (such as bathing), in general Moussa's mixed parentage is a heavy cross to bear.  Still, Moussa is finding his way, with difficulty, in this desert paradise.   <br /> <br />Things will soon come to a boil, however, as theFrench are seeking to assuage their national shame at the hands of the Prussians by building a monumental railroad across the Sahara.  Paul is eager to visit Moussa's homeland, even though Moussa and Paul mistakenly believe each other are dead.  Paul eventually signs on to the real-life and horrendously ill-fated \\"Flatters expedition,\\" which is virtually wiped out by the violent Tuareg.  Scarred by the horrific carnage on the expedition, Paul becomes the most feared enemy the Tuareg have ever faced. <br /> <br />Ball balances all these major elements of war and political intrigue with several intimate storylines of love, family and friendship.  He shows a real gift for capturing the youthful perspective of Paul and Moussa as children and then giving each character a realistic, more mature voice in their later years.  Battle scenes are handled exquisitely, and Ball is equally at home describing the bucolic French countryside as he is describing the harsh beauty of the Sahara. <br /> <br />Chock full of details, \\"Empires\\" is a well-researched work of historical fiction that rivals the best of the genre.  Action, love, heartache, humor, and historical detail are all in full bloom, and \\"Empires\\" becomes virtually impossible to put down.  A must read!	2005-08-11
US	51070201	R2KW3TQXC0XNU2	0399152563	800350613	Prince of Darkness	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Mystery Short on Bloodshed, Long on Intrigues	Sharon Kay Penman's fourth medieval mystery novel, \\"Prince of Darkness,\\" continues to offer appeals of a more intellectual than visceral nature, but the novel's appeal is nevertheless considerable.    Justin de Quincy, hero of the first three novels in this enjoyable series, remains the \\"Queen's Man,\\" dedicated to Eleanor of Aquitane.  But in \\"Prince of Darkness,\\" Justin is tricked into working at the behest of his nemesis, the diabolical Prince John.  John's elder brother, Richard Lionheart, remains locked away in a Bavarian dungeon (and John has not-so-quietly conspired to keep him there) but is on the verge of winning his freedom thanks to the tireless efforts of Eleanor.  John, who will take the crown on Richard's death as long as he stays in Richard's good graces, has an alliance with King Phillipe of France to further that end, but what is a man to do when a forged letter appears offering false proof of the kind of treachery everyone suspects of John -- namely, that he wants to keep Richard in a Bavarian dungeon?  John must clear his name of the letter's slander if he has any chance of succeeding to the throne -- the only unforgiveable sin is the one for which you get caught!    John has no conscience and few allies, so he enlists Justin's assistance even though he tried to have Justin killed in the last novel.  Against his better instincts but out of devout loyatly to Eleanor, Justin agrees to help the Prince.    Like Penman's previous murder mysteries, \\"Prince of Darkness\\" actually doesn't have that much violence in it.  To be sure, there are murders and swordfights, but the novel's strengths lie in its solid grounding in its time period as Penman makes twelfth century France come alive, and in the logical yet unpredictable progression of the story.  Penman doesn't depend on eleventh-hour arrivals of surprise witnesses or other cheap stunts -- she crafts solid, if not exceptional, mysteries that gain strength from their plausibility.    If you like your mysteries of the Agatha Christie mold where likely suspects are killed off in droves, Penman's mysteries are likely to disappoint. If you are intrigued by a solid mystery set among the pell-mell lives of England's most tumultuous family, then \\"Prince of Darkness\\" is just the novel for you.  Check it out.	2005-08-09
US	51070201	R386U9E3OPM9Y4	0786706759	844718574	A Cafe on the Nile	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Epic Thriller Set in 1930's Abyssinia -- Wow!	Bartle Bull's \\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" is a rip-roaring adventure yarn set in 1930's Africa -- generally set in the urban jungle of Cairo and the vast plains and mountains of Abyssinia (Ethiopia).  A large cast of characters breathes life into Bull's vast canvas, as the novel is part romance, part war novel, part treasure hunt, and all excitement. <br /> <br />Full disclosure -- I picked this novel up without knowing it is a sequel to Bull's \\"The White Rhino Hotel.\\"  I think this novel succeeds as a stand-alone work, although I'm pretty sure I would have enjoyed it even more knowing some of the backstory involving many of the characters -- suffice it to say that I will be jumping into \\"Hotel\\" as soon as possible! <br /> <br />Bull has truly created a cast for the ages.  The dwarf Olivio runs the titular Cafe, and his devious mind is forever plotting his next venture (as well as how to ruin his enemies).  Bull captures the psuedo-formal speech and thought of this Goan genius very well, and Olivio's brainstorms are among the most entertaining passages in the novel.  Unfortunately for Olivio, he has taken on some powerful enemies as he seeks to expand his holdings in the Nile Delta, and this is a land where enemies play for keeps.  But with trusty Lord Penfold at his side, as well as the muscular Nubian Tariq, Olivio has a fighting chance. <br /> <br />On a parallel storyline, the English gypsy Anton Rider is trying to put his marriage to the beautiful doctor-in-training Gwenn back together.  Fed up with Anton's multiple infidelities and his long absences on safari, Gwenn and her two sons are shacking up with Lorenzo Grimaldi, an officer in the Italian air force.  Gwenn's romance with Grimaldi comes to a sudden halt once she decides to take part in the Red Cross efforts in Abyssinia -- everyone knows that Italy is soon going to invade Abyssinia and annex it as part of Mussolini's bid to bring the Roman Empire back from the ashes of history.  And soon Gwenn is in the middleof the fighting as the Italian war machine hits the Abyssinians hard with everything at its disposal . . . including the poison gas outlawed by the ineffectual League of Nations. <br /> <br />Anton Rider is also in Abyssinia when the war breaks out, leading a bunch of rich Americans on safari, including the beautiful (and sexually aggressive) twin Kentuckians, Harriett and Bernadette.  The safari is spoiled by the outbreak of the war, particularly because the Italians see that Harriett has filmed the Italians using the poison gas.  Rather than risk international outrage for this breach of the rules of war, the Italians decide it would simply be easier to kill the witnesses. <br /> <br />Further complicating matters, Anton Rider's ruthless friend, the German mercenary/thief/soldier Ernst von Decken, has stolen several chests of Italian silver coins which are vital to the war effort.  Soon, von Decken is also engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with the Italian army. <br /> <br />\\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" is not for those looking for subtle character developments.  The novel is set at a harsh time and in a harsh place, and bullets, swords, cleavers, crocodiles, and other \\"tools\\" create a pretty high body count.  And Bull's characters obviously find danger to be a powerful aphrodisiac, as there is quite a bit o'sex to go along with the violence.  And while the heroes are quite able to dish out the violence, the villains (generally, the Italian armed forces) are equally up to the task. <br /> <br />Spiced with generous amounts of action and humor, \\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" offers some genuine moments of sorrow, as not all the beloved characters who start the novel survive to its finish.  Winding up with a final chapter that promises more novels to come (including, apparently, \\"The Devil's Oasis,\\" already written), \\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" promises more rollicking excitement for its readers.  A thrill-ride from start to finish, \\"A Cafe on the Nile\\" is virtually impossible to put down.  A must-read!	2005-07-29

A Vietnam War veteran, Rain is starting to get a little long in the tooth, but for the consummate professional killer, this means a mere shifting of tactics rather than an abandonment of his chosen profession. <br /> <br />And the work is still there.  Rain and his gargantuan sniper comrade Dox are tasked by the Mossad to bring down one Manheim Lavi, a dastardly sort who is selling is bomb expertise to terrorists across the world.  But the hit in Manila goes bad when Manny's young son interrupts the attempt and Rain has a brief crisis of conscience.  The ensuing chaos convinces the Mossad that they need to eliminate Rain and Dox in order to protect themselves, and the failed hit also puts ex-CIA spook Jim Hilger on their tail.  And Hilger isn't one to let the trail get cold before he \\"takes remedial action.\\" <br /> <br />Mossad agent Delilah returns to \\"help\\" Rain and Dox get out of their mess, and Eisler keeps both Rain and the reader jumping as Delilah's conflicting devotion to Rain and to her country leads everyone to question her priorities.  Eisler also brings the goods with the exotic locales, as the novel whisks its heroes from Manila to Hong Kong to Tokyo to Bangkok, each of which Eisler captures with economic clarity.    <br /> <br />There is a danger with any series where the hero hits the fourth book -- the hero becomes superhuman.  This is a great risk with someone like John Rain, since he faces death so many times (you begin to think that someone, someday, will just get lucky and there will be no more John Rain stories).  Eisler manages to cope with this by showing in great detail how Rain does all the \\"dirty little things\\" to maximize his chances of success and also how Rain acknowledges that he's getting older -- although Eisler gives Rain a few chances to show that he's still a master at improvised combat.   <br /> <br />\\"Killing Rain\\" also ends on a semi-cliffhanger note, as the final chapters reveal that a villain from the earlier novels, the Japanese politician Yamaoto, is still after Rain.  Rain's first romantic attachment, the jazz musician Midori, is still linked to Rain in the most intimate of ways.  And another key villain from this book is left alive to plot revenge against Rain and Dox.   <br /> <br />There are a few plot holes in \\"Killing Rain\\" that probably should have been cleared up -- the biggest being that a key eyewitness to an early assassination later sees Rain and fails to recognize him at all.  But these aren't too egregious to spoil the fun that is the Rain series.  Eisler has the details of Rain's \\"underground\\" world down cold, and one wonders how Eisler gets his knowledge of just the right way to set up for a hit, break into a room, or plot an escape route.  Eisler clearly has another Rain book in the works, and in \\"Killing Rain\\" he proves that Eisler can sustain his anti-hero for the long haul.   <br /> <br />All in all, a fun, quick (330-odd pages with large print) read that will be very hard to put down.	2005-07-29
US	51070201	R3PCMPPQWL5AG8	0670033502	474068385	The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Excellent Treatment of Off-Target Crusade	Jonathan Phillips' \\"The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople,\\" offers a concise, highly readable treatment of an episode in Christian history that is so dark that Pope John Paul II felt obliged to offer an official Catholic apology to the Greek Orthodox Church.  This bloody affair took many twists and turns on its road to infamy, and Phillips brings them all to the reader in a highly convincing fashion. <br /> <br />The Fourth Crusade started as a traditional crusade - the Christians of Western Europe were marching to reclaim Jerusalem in the name of God and Jesus.  Phillips highlights many of the details that comprise that broad stroke -- financial interests, spiritual salvation, and the just plain need for European knights to bust some heads all played some part in the motivation behind this Crusade.  And yet, the Fourth Crusade never reached Jeruslam and wrapped up its business by sacking Constantinople, the largest city in Christendom.  How?  Why? <br /> <br />Phillips explores the cavalcade of tragi-comic errors that led to the transformation of the Christian crusade against the \\"infidel\\" Muslims into a war between Catholic and Greek Orthodox Christians.  Bad judgment combined with political expediency and the Crusaders' need to augment their forces to produce a force willing to march on Constantinople, and the Greek city's ineffectual leadership produced a ripe environment for a successful siege (including perhaps most importantly a credible Greek claimant to the throne who beseeched the Crusaders for help). <br /> <br />As you can imagine, such a venture involves a dizzying cast of characters.  Phillips shines a light on several of them, and his treatment is properly restrained yet insightful -- a testament to and product of Phillips' command of the primary sources of the period.  Quoting at length from letters, official church documents, and other sources, Phillips grounds \\"The Fourth Crusade\\" in the available authorities -- yet Phillips is not about to let flaws in the primary sources go by unchallenged. <br /> <br />A fun, frustrating, engrossing read, \\"The Fourth Crusade\\" is an excellent first exposure to this historical event.	2005-07-25

For the first time, I feel I have read a balanced account of the Christian campaign to retake Jerusalem in the late 11th century. <br /> <br />Asbridge probably hits his highest marks when he analyzes the complex motives of the Crusaders.  It's not always easy to explain a complex situation, and the Crusades, Asbridge reminds us, were incredibly complex undertakings.  He starts with an excellent exposition of the political and religious events that brought Pope Urban II to the papacy, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Urban's motives for initiating the Crusade.  But Urban was no warrior-pope -- he had to inspire others to take up the quest, and the disparate, competitive leaders of the Crusades each had their own agendas.  Sure, there was some demonization of the Muslims and there was a considerable amount of religious fervor involved (Asbridge makes a convincing case that a sinful knight would eagerly look at the spiritual salvation offered by the Crusades), but there were also several folks who went along on the Crusades for less noble purposes.   <br /> <br />Asbridge resists the temptation of so many historians to bite off a \\"silver bullet\\" and say that \\"X is the reason everyone went on the Crusades.\\"  This is refreshing and has the benefit of probably being true.  Some of the book's most entertaining passages come from when the competing agendas and conflicting purposes of the Crusaders threaten to bring down the entire operation, particularly where the Roman Catholic Crusaders are playing dice with the Greek Orthodox Emperor of Byzantium/Constantinople, Alexius (one heck of a character!). <br /> <br />Another high mark for Asbridge is his attention to the chaotic political state of the Islamic world at the time.  Asbridge points out that far from demonizing all Muslims, the Crusaders made treaties with Muslims and played one Muslim sect against another as long as it suited their purposes.  While Asbridge never goes so far as to say that the Crusaders didn't really consider Muslims \\"the other,\\" he makes a convincing case that not all Crusaders viewed all Muslims as the embodiment of evil --thereby refuting a currently chic notion.   <br /> <br />Asbridge does not spare the reader the horrors of the Crusades, either, which in addition to battle included starvation and disease.  He does refrain from adopting a \\"you are there\\" style of reconstructing the battlefield, although he does provide lengthy quotes of battle scenes from contemporary writers.  Quick to point out the medieval trait of greatly over-exaggerating the numbers of soldiers involved in battles, Asbridge paints a good battle scene, but if you're looking for a riveting \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" style account, you're probably going to be disappointed. <br /> <br />A lean work, clocking in at under 350 pages, \\"The First Crusade\\" includes helpful maps and a charming attention to detail -- Asbridge notes, for example, the irony that Pope Urban dies after the capture of Jerusalem but before he can learn the \\"good news.\\"  Highly recommended, \\"The First Crusade\\" offers an explanation of the unique characteristics of this campaign and in its conclusion, makes a convincing yet brief case for its future impact.  Check it out.	2005-07-20

Martin for blending the chilling legends of the vampire with the romantic-yet-quite-spooky Southern setting of the lower Mississippi.  The smokestacks and articulated bannisters of the Mississippi steamboats are a marvelous substitute for the gothic towers of European vampire novels, and Martin has done his research into both the steamboat life and vampire lore in his efforts to produce a darn good thriller.   <br /> <br />The novel opens in 1857, as Abner Marsh seeks to rebuild his shattered fortune - his budding steamer fleet has been all but wiped out by the vicious ice of the Mississippi.  Down to one small steamer, Marsh receives what should be a gift from the gods - a rich partner who is willing both to invest massive sums of money in Marsh's company to build the finest, fastest steamer on the river (the titular Fevre Dream), and also to leave Marsh in charge.  But while the heavily-warted Marsh may be the ugliest man on the river, he is one of the canniest, and he knows that his new partner, the pale and mysterious Joshua York, is going to bring some troubles. <br /> <br />And indeed, the young-old Mr. York does bring a heap of troubles down on Mr. Marsh, in the form of his dreams of saving his people . . . who just happen to be vampires.  Martin has great fun tweaking the reader's conceptions of vampires -- much of the common lore of vampires is fiction, but the vampires do have the same basic characteristics of most vampire stories.  They shun sunlight and drink blood, and most have the nasty habit of referring to humans as \\"cattle.\\"   <br /> <br />But York is the exception, and dreams of bringing his people into harmonic existence with humans.  Of course, many vampires don't like this idea, and the biggest, baddest vampire of them all is Damon Julian, living in southern gothic splendour outside of New Orleans.  York knows he must topple Julian, the bloodmaster, if he is to bring about his revolution, and Julian is only to eager to take on this upstart. <br /> <br />In a novel that has thrills, chills, horrors, and blood to spare, Martin makes an unexpected choice, and one that I didn't really like.  For reasons that should not be explained here, a 13-year gap occurs late in the book before the climactic final act.  This gap feels out of place in this otherwise lean, mean novel (the hardcover version clocks in at an entertaining 350 pages), and the gap really doesn't need to be there.  It does allow for great scenes where Martin shows the ravages of time on both a steamer as well as a dastardly henchman.  The ultimate conclusion also feels oddly truncated, as a couple of villains don't get the comeuppance they deserve. <br /> <br />But these are relative quibbles about an enjoyable read.  Perhaps it's because I've come to \\"Fevre Dream\\" after reading the first three novels in Martin's five-star epic series, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"  I admit having unfairly high expectations for \\"Fevre Dream,\\" and the fact that they were not quite met probably says more about me than Mr. Martin or \\"Fevre Dream.\\"  Nevertheless, this novel is one fun read and will keep you up in the wee hours as the plot drives you onward, just like the big river itself.	2005-07-07

Scott Bakker's first novel, \\"The Darkness That Comes Before,\\" left me wondering just what the hell was going on.  Bakker created an original new world, Earwe, with a long, tortured history, and dropped you smack-dab in the middle of it without much of an explanation . . . and you were generally left to fend for yourself as you learned about the religious strife plaguing the countries, the political intrigues, the spying of the various sorcerers' Schools, and romantic sub-plots. <br /> <br />In the hands of a lesser writer, \\"The Darkness That Comes Before\\" would have been an annoyance rather than a great read, but Bakker brings the goods.  A poetic style combines with the patience to only gradually reveal key details to make \\"The Darkness That Comes Before\\" a truly enjoyable journey through an original, if completely foreign, land. <br /> <br />In \\"The Warrior Prophet,\\" Bakker hits a new high mark, as the various plots and agendas of the vast cast of characters are much clearer.  The Holy War, which is essentially a medieval Crusade on steroids, is marching south towards its goal of the city of Shimeh.  Being an amalgamation of forces and followers from various nations, the Holy War is plagued by in-fighting, and there is almost as much bloodshed within the Holy War as there is directed towards their hated foes.   <br /> <br />While the nobles still lead their respective armies, it is undeniable that Anasurimbor Kellhus (the titular \\"Prince of Nothing\\") is growing in influence and is gradually becoming the de facto leader of the expedition.  Kellhus, who may be even more of a demi-god in this second novel than he was in the first, continues to pursue his own agenda by seemingly coopting the agenda of the Holy War.  While his precise motives for tracking down his father aren't always clear, he moves with an undeniable purpose, foiling assassination attempts while winning over the hearts and minds of those around him, even occasionally the hearts of those who hate him, or those who have sworn themselves to another. <br /> <br />In the midst of the Holy War, an alien race strides in the guise of men, known only by Kellhus and the mighty sorcerer Drusas Achamian . . . which of course marks both Kellhus and Drusas for death.  This is inconvenient for both, as there is already a long line of people who want both Kellhus and Drusas to depart this world, as painfully as possible.   <br /> <br />The good news is that now that the Holy War is marching, there are numerous opportunities for Bakker to demonstrate that he can play with the \\"big boys\\" when it comes to depicting the horrors of the battlefield (Bernard Cornwell and Cormac McCarthy come to mind as you read Bakker's works, as does Manda Scott).  From the clash of armies to Kellhus' inhuman battle gifts to Drusas unleashing his sorcerer's rage, \\"The Warrior Prophet\\" is rife with blood and triumph.   <br /> <br />\\"The Warrior Prophet\\" can be a difficult book at times, as literally hundreds of thousands of people are killed during the Holy War.  And while many of these deaths occur on the battlefield, Bakker also shows the price of folly that comes from a flawed strategy, as he shows the horrifying cost to the Holy War as they fight to cross a blast-furnace of a desert without water.  During these passages, \\"The Warrior Prophet\\" passes from the realm of mere fantasy fiction into something larger, more epic, that brings to mind the Exodus from the Bible or the more daunting passages from \\"The Iliad\\" or \\"The Aeniad.\\" <br /> <br />While definitely a large work, \\"The Warrior Prophet\\" powers itself along quite nicely with many subplots and rich characters.  You should not be daunted by the length of these books -- for one thing, the layout of the book is such that words are not \\"crammed\\" onto the page.  I haven't done an official comparison, but as an example I think that John Marco's \\"The Jackal of Nar\\" is a book that may have fewer pages than \\"The Warrior Prophet,\\" but thanks to its printing has many more words printed on each page . . . Lord knows \\"Jackal\\" felt like a longer book than \\"Prophet.\\"   <br /> <br />A tantalizing coda in the final chapter hints that the next novel in the series will open up a new front for Bakker's heroes.  The Sranc are an evil, inhuman race that have only received passing mention in the first two novels, but it appears that they will be arriving in a big way in Book 3, promising yet another epic novel.   <br /> <br />For those looking for lean, mean thrillers, don't look to \\"The Prince of Nothing\\" series.  For those looking to dive in and roll around in a completely realized and richly detailed alternate universe that has armies and hatreds to spare, \\"The Prince of Nothing\\" is the series for you.  Check it out.	2005-07-05

Marco has created a complex world of political intrigue, where empires of science and magic use swords and kerosene cannons to pursue their bloody ambitions.  But some juicy supporting characters are overcome by Marco's choice of protagonist, Prince Richius, who is an unconvincing military \\"genius\\" whose selfishness causes much of the (considerable) grief that besets the novel. <br /> <br />The novel opens with Richius leading a doomed campaign on behalf of an Emperor Arkus out of political expediency.  The causes of the war and the nature of Richius' opponents are never really explained.  He's fighting \\"Drol,\\" but it's never really clear if the Drol are another species (elves?) or merely another race of mankind.  The battle scenes are rendered powerfully, as is the disenchantment that afflicts the soldiers. <br /> <br />Richius is Prince of Aramoor, a small kingdom in the Empire.  Soon, Richius is dubbed king, but he shirks his responsibility to his kingdom to pursue information about a beautiful prostitute, Dyana (a \\"Triin\\" -- like the \\"Drol,\\" another group whose nature is never fully explained), with whom Richius spent one night of passion.  Richius, however, spent this night of passion with Dyana after rebuking his friend Dinadin for wanting to hire the very same prostitute - \\"we're here to help these people,\\" Richius hypocritically bloviates, shortly before hiring her.  Richius repeatedly tells people that he \\"has to do something,\\" even if it's a bad idea, and spends much of the novel worrying about the vast gulf between his noble intentions and his selfish actions -- actions which leave many friends and family horribly dead. <br /> <br />Marco has also elevated Richius to the level of military genius, which we know primarily because people keep telling Richius that he is a good soldier . . . but we never really see Richius do or say anything that would lead us to that conclusion ourselves.  Sure, during the climactic battle of the novel we hear that Richius has mapped out some defensive measures, but this is far too little, far too late. <br /> <br />All things considered, Richius is about as disappointing a protagonist as Anakin Skywalker was in the three \\"Star Wars\\" prequels.   <br /> <br />Fortunately, Marco has populated his world with other, more enjoyable characters.  The Empire is ruled by an Emperor who desires immortality above all things, even as his decrepit body withers away.  The Emperor is surrounded by sycophantic-yet-dueling nobles, all equally addicted to drugs that extend human life well beyond its normal duration - but not without some gruesome side effects.  And the sorcerer Tharn is a character for the ages -- a man who can command the fury of the Gods by channelling storms and wipe out entire armies, Tharn's body is wracked by torments from using the Gods' powers to kill.   <br /> <br />The novel is uneven.  Certain scenes stand out with their startling originality, such as Marco's depictions of the more barbaric tribesmen and some of the battle scenes.  Other scenes just come across as contrived.  At one point, Richius calls over another character to assist him with a mortally wounded comrade.  Once the helper arrives, Richius says, \\"no, you can't help, I've got to find a horse,\\" and walks off leaving the helper standing next to the stricken soldier with nothing to do.  Well, nothing to do except get killed by the dying gesture of the wounded soldier, who hadn't bothered keeping up with current events.  This kind of coincidence shows up a couple of other times in the novel, and they ring more contrived than true.  <br /> <br />Here's hoping that during the remainder of the series, Richius grows into the character that everyone else believes he is.  Marco's universe deserves a hero for the ages, not a whiny petulant kinglet.	2005-06-30
US	51070201	R2Q1ORULD6KG20	1585675598	380195986	The Darkness That Comes Before (The Prince of Nothing, Book 1)	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Stylish Writing Enlivens Dense, Confusing Plot	Bakker's debut novel, \\"The Darkness That Comes Before,\\" is one of the most challenging fantasy novels one can pick up.  Not only has Bakker created a completely foreign alternate world as his setting (replete with thousand-year history, new religions, complex names, and byzantine political intrigues), he drops the reader smack-dab in the middle of one storyline only to abandon it for another for several hundred pages, at which point the storylines more or less merge. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot -- I'm sure that I've missed many of the finer points of conflict during my first read.  Suffice it to say that \\"The Darkness That Comes Before\\" is essentially setting the stage for a massive war (\\"the Second Apocalypse\\").  The problem is, competing political and religious agendas, not to mention lifelong hatreds, makes the unification of forces to go on the merry war a massive undertaking in its own right.  While there are bad guys aplenty among the various armies and nations that will fight on the same side of the Holy War, we barely get acquainted with the forces they'll be fighting against.   <br /> <br />Further complicating matters is the titular \\"Prince of Nothing,\\" Kellhus.  Not a sorcerer (there are plenty of those in this book, never fear, although their wizardry is not often put into practice), not a demigod, but definitely something more than a man, Kellhus joins the Holy War for motives that aren't exactly clear.  Kellhus' father, another mystical figure, is clearly involved, but the nature and extent of Kellhus' mission is never fully explained.  Is he going to kill his father?  Is his father already dead?   <br /> <br />In the hands of a lesser writer, this convoluted, murky plot would have seen \\"The Darkness That Comes Before\\" returned to the bookstand after a few chapters.  Fortunately, Bakker brings the goods, writing with a stylish, poetic voice that compels the reader to devour the pages.  Battle scenes are handled as smoothly as inner, tortured soliloquies.  Light on descriptions of landscapes and other physical features, heavy on dialogue and introspection, Bakker's prose serves to heighten the mysteries of his alternate universe rather than frustrate the reader. <br /> <br />A helpful set of maps (the artwork is reminiscent of the maps of Middle Earth in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" novels - a nice touch) and a glossary/appendix provide a much-needed resource -- kudos to Bakker for including them.  (Full disclosure - I found it much more helpful just to photocopy the pages and have them available loose for reference 'cause I got so tired of flipping back to them.)   <br /> <br />The novel ends without a true climax, but with a clear \\"setting the stage\\" for the next novel, \\"The Warrior-Prophet.\\"  Without a doubt, I will pick up the next book and hope that some of these threads are brought together.   <br /> <br />Not for the squeamish (the battle scenes are harsh, vivid affairs, and there's more than a wee bit o' sex), \\"The Darkness That Comes Before\\" is a novel that probably shouldn't be read on the Stairmaster, but should be savored in an armchair with a favorite beverage.	2005-06-22
US	51070201	R3H5KQ4QOQSLY2	0061012645	79009532	Redcoat	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Cornwell Masters Another Era in Stand-Alone Novel	\\"Redcoat\\" proves that Bernard Cornwell has a talent for research as well as a gift for spinning a heck of a yarn.  \\"Redcoat\\" brings to life the city, citizens, and soldiers in British-occupied Philadelphia in the fall-winter of 1777-78.   <br /> <br />The main strength of \\"Redcoat\\" is that it reminds the reader that the Revolutionary War was not primarily fought on the traditional battlefield, with armies banging away at each other with cannon and musket.  Obviously there were battles, but as Lord William Howe, the British general in charge of the war realized, the British had to also try to win the hearts and minds of the colonials . . . something that is hard to do with a bayonet.  Cornwell turns Howe into his oracle of fatalism regarding the British efforts, although Howe has a bit of Cassandra in him, as several other British figures believe the rebellion can only be stamped out with the sword -- a belief that gives Cornwell ample opportunities to demonstrate that he is the literary master of any battlefield, regardless of the era. <br /> <br />Cornwell relies on a fairly traditional love triangle to tell most of \\"Redcoat,\\" but the well-drawn characters justify this tactic.  The \\"Redcoat\\" of the title is Sam Gilpin, a simple Englishman with a gift for horses but whose loyalties are challenged when his brother Nate is shot before his eyes by a murderous sergeant.  Sam also falls in love with Caroline Crowl, a beautiful, spirited American who has no patience for the British but has eyes for Sam.  Unfortunately, prior to meeting Sam, Caroline made a promise to Jonathan, a crippled young Philadelphian who nobly risks his mercantile inheritance to join up with the rebel forces.  The fortunes of these three do not play out as expected, but their fates make for fascinating reading. <br /> <br />Cornwell gives us several good battle scenes -- fans of his other works will not be disappointed.  He also creates several vivid characters who each have their own ideas about the fate of the colonies and how England should treat them, and their various exchanges are fun, sparky debates.  And Cornwell takes a few opportunities for humor, as well -- Sam's first experience with a colonial bathtub will have your sides splitting. <br /> <br />For those who first came to Cornwell through his various series (The Warlord Chronicles, the Grail Quest, Sharpe, etc.), it's a little odd to read a stand-alone novel like \\"Redcoat.\\"  The novel, while fun, feels a bit truncated.  That's not really a criticism, I suppose, but one does wish that Cornwell had found a storyline to spin into a trilogy.   <br /> <br />All in all, a fun read and a reminder that reminds us that you can write about the American Revolution without focusing on the Founding Fathers.	2005-06-21
US	51070201	R2I07BXLHDFJF3	0385336012	652142321	Ironfire: A Novel of the Knights of Malta and the Last Battle of the Crusades	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Novel Worthy of Titanic Siege -- Wonderful Characters!	David Ball's \\"Ironfire\\" is officially a novel of the infamous siege of Malta, where the massive Ottoman army and navy fought valiantly but was unable to unseat the outmanned Maltese defenders, led by the Knights of St. John.  Fortunately for the reader, \\"Ironfire\\" is about much more than the siege - it's about the people, both \\"big\\" and \\"little,\\" who lived, loved, and died on both sides.   <br /> <br />\\"Ironfire\\" generally tracks four main characters.  Two are the Maltese brother and sister, Nico and Maria Borg.  Nico is kidnapped by Islamic slavers as a small child, but through courage, daring, and vast amounts of luck ends up a captain of a war galley in the Ottoman navy.  Maria remains on Malta, a cultural backwater that is as dedicated to its cro-magnon sexist culture as it is to its Christianity.  Maria is not the kind of woman who will be content to be seen but not heard, and her boldness and beauty make for several compelling passages. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Maria, her beauty and her brains bring her to the attention of Dun Sulvago, a priest who, in his wilder days was one of the biggest womanizers on the European continent and now strives to save souls (and pursue his own ambitions) on the island of Malta.  While generally a decent sort, a fatal weakness earns him the undying hatred of Maria.   <br /> <br />But fortunately for Maria, the same beauty and brains who brought Dun Salvago to her life also bring her Christien deVries.  Christien is fated to join the soldier-monks of the Order of St. John, but his spirit calls for him to become a surgeon rather than a soldier -- and surgeons were pretty low on the sociological food chain at the time.  Christien pursues his studies with zeal and in secret, for dear old dad just ain't a fan o'that book learnin' -- a good son doesn't care about sewing up Christians, he cares about chopping up infidels in the name of Christ. <br /> <br />These \\"major\\" characters are surrounded by well-rounded, fully developed \\"minor\\" characters whose tales tug at the heartstrings and beat at the funnybone . . . although \\"Ironfire\\" is definitely more weighted towards the sorrowful than the joyous, all things considered. <br /> <br />Ball has a complete command of the daily life on Malta, the life of a page in the Sultan's service, and the perils of battlefields both on land and on water.  He writes clearly, but movingly, and several passages demand to be reread thanks to their sheer power and beauty.  Never flowery, always accessible, yet never dumbed-down, \\"Ironfire\\" is one heck of a novel, and is a must-read for fans of historical fiction. <br /> <br />Five stars, without question.	2005-06-09
US	51070201	R1HRTKZ1NQAQB0	0385336713	256227839	Dreaming the Bull (Boudica Trilogy)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Boudica Takes Back-Seat in Tale of Ban/Valerius	Manda Scott continues her Boudica Trilogy with \\"Dreaming the Bull,\\" a shorter sequel to her \\"Dreaming the Eagle.\\"  While the first story focused primarily on the rise of Breaca from promising girl to overpowering woman, \\"Dreaming the Bull\\" spends most of its time tracking the hellish existence of her brother, Ban.  While we miss reading about Breaca, who is one heck of a character, the struggle for identity being fought by the soul of Ban/Valerius makes for some compelling reading. <br /> <br />In the first novel, Ban is separated from Breaca following an ambush.  Mistakenly believing her dead and betrayed by Caradoc (the love of her life), Ban finds solace in the Roman army invading Britain and becomes known as Valerius to the Romans, and as the dead-eyed decurion on the pied horse by the Britons.  Valerius abandons the gods of his ancestors, adopts the ways of the Roman soldier-god Mithras, and brings death and destruction to the Britons in his quest for vengeance against those whom, he believes, killed his beloved sister. <br /> <br />Breaca, mistakenly believing that Ban is dead, swears personal vengeance and undying hatred against the decurion who has slain so many of her people.  \\"Dreaming the Bull\\" builds toward a fairly obvious climax -- the reuniting of Ban/Valerius and Breaca.  Even though this reunion is expected, Scott tells her story with such style and power that both the journey and the reunion are worth the read. <br /> <br />Much of this novel is spent in Rome, and Scott shows a command of Roman life and politics - she shows that she is equally adept at creating the world of Breaca out of almost whole cloth as she is writing about Claudius' Rome, of which so much more is known.  Eschewing the revisionist pro-Claudius take that has been in vogue thanks to Robert Graves' \\"I, Claudius,\\" Scott gives us a Roman emperor who is delightfully corrupt, craven, and brilliant.  Indeed, the entire Roman court seems appropriately populated by vipers, spiders, andother assorted dastardly vermin. <br /> <br />\\"Dreaming the Bull\\" is a story motivated primarily by sorrow and loss, which makes for a depressing read at times.  Breaca's world is under dire threat, and both her larger society as well as her immediate family are in the gravest danger for the entire work.  \\"Dreaming the Bull\\" is over 100 pages shorter than \\"Dreaming the Eagle,\\" so the book is not nearly the slog that the first novel was, and the constant drumbeat of war is not nearly as numbing as it was the first time around.  Perhaps \\"slog\\" is not fair -- Scott writes very well, and creates many scenes of great poignancy (the death of a beloved hound can be as moving as the death of a cherished parent), but the emotions are rather one-note, thanks to the war.   <br /> <br />Scott has chosen to end \\"Dreaming the Bull\\" in a cliff-hanger of almost movie-serial proportions, leaving virtually no guidance as to how the next novel will play out.  I, for one, am eagerly looking forward into diving into the final novel of this powerful, poetic trilogy.	2005-05-26
US	51070201	R3B8186Z2V82CX	0060530510	236428143	The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Chronicles Series #1)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Excellent Kick-Off to New Series -- Here Come the Danes!	Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Last Kingdom\\" sees our favorite spinner of rollicking historical fiction turn his clever eyes to the historical mists surrounding England's King Alfred the Great and his defense of England against the invading Danes (known to you and me as the Vikings).  For those familiar with Cornwell, there are few surprises here, and that is a major plus.   <br /> <br />This tale of 9th-century England is told by Uthred, a fictional character (while many of the other characters in the novel are real-life historical figures).  A Northumbrian, Uthred is captured in battle by the Danes as a child and raised as a Dane, learning their mythology and values.  Yet Uthred remains English at heart, and knows that even while he has learned to honor (and even love) Danes, his destiny will see him fighting in the shield wall against their invasion.  Uthred's inner conflicts make him one Cornwell's more compelling heroes.   <br /> <br />9th-century England is really four separate kingdoms, and over the course of the novel the Danes sweep over three, leaving Wessex to stand alone as the Last Kingdom of the title.  Wessex is led by the scholarly, sickly, pious, and reluctantly randy Alfred.  Uthred has little affection for this man, particularly when placed alongside Uthred's favorite reckless Danes, but Alfred remains a player to be reckoned with.  Alfred has the talent to see Uthred's military prowess, and Uthred rises to become a leader of the English forces. <br /> <br />As one can expect from Cornwell, battle scenes pepper the novel, and Uthred finally gets the chance to satisfy his dream of standing in the front of a massive shield wall against hundreds of foes.  Fortunately for the reader, Uthred is a man of humor as well as might, and Uthred spends a lot of his time bedeviling Christian priests by pointing out the inherent weaknesses of their faith when compared to the noble (and relatively reasonable) worship of Odin and the other Norse gods.  Uthred also has aremarkable ability to be able to tell folks what they want to hear -- while most of Cornwell's heroes have a tendency towards brutal honesty, Uthred has a refreshing talent for mendacity. <br /> <br />Since this is clearly the first novel in a series, the climactic scenes are relatively reserved but are nevertheless satisfying.  Several juicy plot lines remain unresolved, and there are still Danes aplenty in England at the conclusion of the novel.  One can hope that this series will progress in the same fashion as Cornwell's other medieval trilogies, the Grail Quest series and the King Arthur series.  In \\"The Last Kingdom,\\" Cornwell has taken a lean, mean first step with plenty of thrills and a surprising amount of humor.  One heck of an enjoyable read! <br /> <br />	2005-05-23
US	51070201	R2BQSR9U20ZJAF	0312869967	158131111	Knight Errant (War of the Roses)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Fun, Imaginative Yet Overlong Time-Travel Romance	Rodrigo Garcia Y Robertson's \\"Knight Errant\\" offers many pleasures -- an admirable and humourous heroine, an intriguing premise, and a well-researched travelogue through 15th-century England.  Despite its charms, \\"Knight Errant\\" loses some steam over the course of its 470+ pages -- one can imagine this being a fantastic novel had the author chosen a leaner, more focused approach. <br /> <br />Through some surprisingly logical time-travel magic, helpfully explained and abetted by some modern-day English witches, our heroine, Robyn Stafford, finds herself whisked away to 15th century England and thrust pell-mell into the Wars of the Roses.  Not only that, the \\"Lady Stafford\\" has instantly developed a romantic attachment to teenage Edward, Earl of March and a medieval template for future Harlequin Romance book covers.  Witchcraft, siege warfare, jousting, and other medieval delights await Robyn as she becomes more and more intertwined in the tapestry of medieval history. <br /> <br />Despite being a fantasy, the author has done his research, as olde England comes alive.  In true Hollywood form, Robyn is a sarcastic gal, and she makes many pithy, humorous observations about medieval life . . . although she quickly sees that life in the Middle Ages has its benefits, including falling in love with a handsome future king.  (Although there are pitfalls, too, including becoming acquainted to the 15th century version of the 21st Brit with whom she had a torrid affair in L.A., only to fly to England to learn that he has a wife.  Oh, yes, his 21st century wife is also in the 15th century -- sometimes you just can't win.)  <br /> <br />Despite containing quite a few action scenes, \\"Knight Errant\\" seems overlong.  A large cast of characters, numerous villains and allies, and several jaunts back and forth in time are a lot to keep track of, and with Robyn as the outsider telling the story with more than a wee bit of detachment, several passages just don't seem to have any sense ofurgency.  And, inexplicably, most of the villains are denied even a strong comeuppance -- the reader just wants to see some of these guys get theirs.  (Even the author acknowledges during the final passages that certain romantic events have been a long time coming.) <br /> <br />Entertaining, to be sure, with a few laugh-out-loud moments (although not nearly as funny as other sword-and-sorcery novels, such as \\"Sir Apropos of Nothing), \\"Knight Errant\\" is a fun read that, although long, is worth the investment of time.  Here's to hoping that the Mr. Garcia Y Robertson can find the discipline to cut a few of his well-crafted scenes and find the heart of story.	2005-05-18

A powerful book, Scott sacrifices realism for mysticism and spins a riveting tale. <br /> <br />From the opening pages, where Breaca (who grows into the warrior princess Boudicca) at the age of 11 or thereabouts slays the tribesman who just murdered Breaca's pregnant mother, Scott makes it clear that Breaca's story is one of intense emotional peaks and valleys.  Breaca's world is a somber one where ghosts, gods, and spirits have an undeniable presence, and the power of an individual's spirit is as important as age, intellect, or strength of arm.   <br /> <br />Scott convincingly creates a daily life for the mystical Breaca (about whom virtually nothing is known for certain) -- history is so meager with its offerings about Boudicca that it's almost hard to call \\"Dreaming the Eagle\\" historical fiction rather than straight fiction.  While many of these passages can be slow going -- Scott's style is more lyric than expository, and \\"Dreaming the Eagle\\" could never be confused with the works of Sharon Kay Penman or Colleen McCullough -- they add a richness to the story.  Breaca is the champion of a mystical, wonderful civilization rather than a mere barbarian warrior princess. <br /> <br />Stocked with richly drawn characters, \\"Dreaming the Eagle\\" spends most of its time in Britain, but also offers several good scenes in Gaul and Germania as Ban, Breaca's brother, finds himself a Roman auxiliary after a traitorous double-cross gives him the mistaken belief that Breaca is dead.  Ban undergoes his own extensive emotional torment that is probably far beyond his years, but again, Scott presumes that the children of Britain have to mature at a phenomenally early age to survive their harsh existence. <br /> <br />Offering battle scenes to rival Bernard Cornwell, \\"Dreaming the Eagle\\" has its share of thrills to offer the reader, although that does not prevent the reader from being aware that this is a very long book.  Heavy on the pain, light on the humor, \\"Dreaming the Eagle\\" is not a page-turner that will keep you up at night.  It is, however, a book that can be savored for hours in an arm-chair and, unlike to much lighter fare, stay with you long after you finish the epilogue.  Here's looking forward to the sequel, \\"Dreaming the Bull.\\"	2005-05-04

We meet Escobar in the early days and watch with fascination as he rises from street tough to cocaine warlord, generating income of almost $2 billion per year.  Not content to make tons of money, Escobar wants to become a cherished Don of the nation, and even gets elected into the national government.  His rise to power (and his iron-fisted hold on it) is due to his twin gifts for terrorism and public relations.  Despite the fact that Escobar was personally responsible for the murder, kidnapping, torture, and rape of hundreds if not thousands of Columbians, many Columbians saw him as a beloved Robin Hood figure.  Some of the most excruciatingly frustrating passages in the book come when listening to Escobar play the put-upon do-gooder to the mass media, which he was able to play like a maestro.   <br /> <br />Bowden follows both Columbians and Americans in this book, which is a strength.  According to Bowden, there's no denying that America was heavily involved in this manhunt, but due to political realities both in the U.S. and in Columbia, that involvement was on the hush-hush.  It's hard to tell who is more frustrated during the search for Escobar -- the U.S. military \\"advisers\\" who have to deal with Columbian policemen and military forces who won't suffer the indignity of crawling in the dirt for concealment as they launch a surprise raid on one of Escobar's luxurious villas, or the Columbian deputy justice minister who has his own bodyguards draw weapons on him as he tries tonegotiate Escobar's surrender. <br /> <br />Prepare to be stunned as you read \\"Killing Pablo.\\"  I have never read a description of one private individual so thoroughly controlling an entire nation.  Capitalizing on the corruption inherent in the Columbian government, Escobar was in complete control of every branch of government, and it was harder to find an honest man in the government than it was to find a corrupted one.  (Actually, that's not right -- it was very easy to find the honest men, because Escobar had so many of them killed.) <br /> <br />Bowden excels in fly-on-the-wall, \\"you are there\\" reporting of events.  This places Bowden at the mercy of his sources, many of whom have considerable axes to grind, both to protect their own reputations for honesty as well as to make sure they get credit for their role in the Escobar manhunt.  This is particularly chilling during 1993, when the vigilante grous Los Pepes starts taking out Escobar's friends and family in ruthless fashion . . . possibly through the illicit use of American intelligence.   <br /> <br />Of course, as we all know, the official story is that Escobar gets killed by the Columbian police.  Bowden offers a tantalizing hint or two that suggests that our Delta Force may have been in on the kill, but nothing is proven. <br /> <br />In what proves to be an uninspiring coda to this story, Bowden tells us the truth -- that while the hunt for Escobar was ultimately successful in getting its man, at the cost of hundreds of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, the killing of Pablo Escobar may have merely set the stage for the Cali cartel to take over all drug trafficking in Columbia.  Like the legendary hydra, the drug business is simply too massive for the death of someone like Escobar to matter all that much.   <br /> <br />Others have accused Bowden of shoddy research in some areas.  I cannot quibble with his research, except in one minor area.  Early on, Bowden uses the death of college basketball's Len Bias, star at the University of Maryland, of a cocaine overdose to demonstrate that American attitudes towards cocaine started getting officially more negative in the 1980's.  Bowden refers to Bias as the top pick in the NBA Draft.  This is not accurate -- Bias was the #2 pick in the NBA Draft, by the Boston Celtics, but the #1 pick was North Carolina's Brad Daugherty.  While this is a minor mistake in a large book, it is a basic fact that Bowden and his editors should have caught . . . and this does call Bowden's research on harder-to-prove points into question. <br /> <br />Still, a fun, if often frustrating, read.	2005-05-03

Christopher \\"Kit\\" Marlowe, playwright, lover, and spy, is one of England's great rogues and his mysterious death (accidentally killed in drunken fight or assassinated by higher powers?) is one of the most delightfully intriguing tales to come out of Elizabethan England.  So why does Welsh limit herself to 140 small pages (with a big font, no less)?   <br /> <br />It surely isn't out of a lack of talent or a lack of familiarity with Marlowe.  Welsh is an entertaining writer who dares to tell the story of Marlowe's last days from Marlowe's perspective.  A poet and playwright until the end, Marlowe can't help but throw off japes, witty asides, and biting sarcasm as he seeks to escape his doom.  Every step rings true in this work, as Marlowe emerges as a selfish hedonist whose survival instinct is perhaps only exceeded by his desire to see his works become immortal.   <br /> <br />Welsh also has a command of the dirty, steamy life in the stews of London -- her descriptions of life among the commoners are brief yet vivid.   <br /> <br />While one cannot quibble with an author writing a lean, mean treatment of a small subject (considering how much bloat and gas can be found is so many larger works), one wishes that Welsh had bitten off a bit more to chew with Marlowe.  Well worth your time (since \\"Tamburlaine Must Die\\" commands so little of it) and good for a chuckle or two in addition to some thrills, this book is nevertheless not a \\"must read\\" by any stretch of the imagination.	2005-04-26

Bissinger's \\"Friday Night Lights\\" should be required reading for all fans of high school sports -- from the die-hard to the casual.  Bissinger is equally adept at describing the highs and lows of the actual game of football -- a delight to all fans -- but the book's true power lies in its cautionary tale about placing high school football on an impossibly-high pedestal.  <br /> <br />Granted unparalleled access to the key players in this drama, Bissinger tells a magnificently-detailed story of the 1988 Permian (Odessa, Texas) high school football team.  Players, coaches, spouses, alumni, school officials, and others finds their way into this important story of misplaced priorities and hypocrisy interwoven with absolute devotion to the game of football. <br /> <br />Permian High may have the most successful football program in the country.  Stuck in the middle of the Permian basis of west Texas, Odessa has nothing going for it in 1988 except football.  Bissinger describes in hilarious, infuriating detail the economic wreck that is Odessa, circa 1988, following the colossal oil boom of the preceding years.  (The descriptions of the west Texas spending spree are hilarious and shocking at the same time.)  One of the most enjoyable chapters in the book, \\"Sisters,\\" actually has little to do with football but instead focuses on the intense rivalry between hard-hat Odessa and Polo-shirt Midland, Texas (hint at the dynamics:  you go to Midland to raise a family and you go to Odessa to raise hell).  Odessa's 20% unemployment and silent oil rigs give the residents little to cheer about except the magnificent Panthers, who always compete for the 5-A state title despite fielding teams invariably smaller and shorter than their opponents. <br /> <br />Players are treated like gods, coaches are expendable unless they bring championships, and a (rare) loss finds 20,000 fans second-guessing every coach and player in blunt, profane language.  Alumni recall glory days with equal parts fondness, pain, and anger.  And teachers wonder why nobody cares about school anymore. <br /> <br />As the team marches towards the Holy Grail, the state championship, Bissinger explores several tough issues.  Perhaps most shocking is the rampant racism that permeates Odessa.  This features prominently in the story of running back Boobie Miles, a black kid literally from the wrong side of the tracks who has had everything given to him because of his astounding ability to run with the football.  What happens to this pampered, spoiled, under-educated child when he blows out his knee is heartbreaking on about fifteen different levels.  Other players have their own crosses to bear, each of which has its own poignancy.  My favorite story involves Harvard-bound Brian Chavez and his father, but there are several fascinating sub-plots here. <br /> <br />But possibly the most shocking story in the book only indirectly involves Permian High.  The mightiest team in the state is from Dallas, populated with super-spoiled jocks destined for Division I scholarships.  This squad gets imbroiled in a grade-fixing scandal that rocks the state, and one cannot help at be disgusted with the priorities of several players, parents, school officials, and colleges in this immorality play.  (And then, after the season, the Dallas team tops itself in the halls of shame in spectacular fashion that must be read to be believed.) <br /> <br />Through it all, Bissinger writes extremely well, using flashbacks and leapfrogging through time to keep the reader flipping those pages.  Equally at home writing about the actual game of football as he is describing the off-field antics and history, Bissinger's book is one for the ages. <br /> <br />Full disclosure - I saw the film version of this story before reading the book.  The film is excellent, but is an incredibly streamlined version of the tale (virtually no discussion of the oil boom, for example) that was also slightly altered for dramatic effect.  If you have seen the movie, you must read the book to get the full story, and this is an important story.   <br /> <br />A must-read for all parents of kids playing high school sports (or destined to play high school sports)!	2005-04-26
US	51070201	RNG4YJPVLSWYP	0385336632	950447500	The Field of Swords (Emperor, Book 3)	Books	4	10	13	N	N	"Field of Swords" -- Fun Ahistorical Historical Fiction	Conn Iggulden's \\"The Field of Swords\\" continues his \\"Emperor\\" series, to borrow a phrase, it's like the first two books, only more so.   <br /> <br />From his first book in the series, Iggulden has demonstrated a willingness to depart from the historical record.  When it comes to Julius Caesar, that's playing with fire, if for no other reason than that Caesar's life is astounding enough on its own that it leaves little room for editorializing.  However, we must respect Iggulden is writing fiction, not another biography of the historical giant (and to Iggulden's credit, he repeatedly recommends Christian Meier's masterful biography, Caesar, for folks who want the straight story).   <br /> <br />By making some rather harsh choices (for example, Cicero merits barely a mention in Iggulden's novels), Iggulden has offended many readers, to be sure.  For readers familiar with the historical period, it is harder to suspend our disbelief when reading about certain events when we know that they just did not transpire in the manner described.  I imagine that the less familiar one is with the subject, the more entertaining the series is. <br /> <br />Fortunately for all concerned, even Roman history buffs, Iggulden is a fine writer and creates many memorable scenes in \\"Field of Swords.\\"  Several battle scenes quicken the pulse, but Iggulden also writes excellent scenes around more domestic fare, such as a bunch of humbled Roman blacksmiths learning the intricate art of Spanish swordmaking.   <br /> <br />And the broad strokes are all here to create a fine theater for our favorite characters.  Caesar rides from Spain to Gaul to Britain and eventually comes to a crisis point at the Rubicon.  Crassus builds his astounding fortune but chafes under his less-than-stellar military reputation.  Pompey rules Rome with an iron fist and yet fears this upstart running rampant on the frontier.  Servilia's love for Caesar burns white-hot.  Brutus continues his quest to be the perfect sword,yet cracks form in his friendship with Caesar.  (And there are many other storylines of note.)  Not all the characters make it through to the end, and we generally are sad to see them go - a testament to Iggulden's ability to spin an entertaining tale. <br /> <br />Again, for readers looking for a highly factual fictionalized account of Julius Caesar, look to Colleen McCullouch's titanic \\"Masters of Rome\\" series.  (Her research is impeccable, and she includes a glossry and highly detailed maps -- for some bizarre reason, Iggulden's novels do not include a single map, which is a bizarre omission.)  But for fans of a leaner, lighter, more action-packed treatment, Iggulden's series will do just fine, thank you very much.	2005-04-21
US	51070201	R1F5OANDTY5OYN	9997413601	833496406	The Firedrake	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Lean, mean book for lean, mean hero	Cecilia Holland's \\"The Firedrake\\" recounts some of the events in the life of the Irishman Laeghaire of Tralee, of the Long Road.  Using stark, spare prose, Holland tells Laeghaire's tale, a tale of war and conquest, with a bit of humor and a lot of sorrow thrown into the mix.    The novel starts out with Laeghaire on the run across Germany for unknown reasons . . . indeed, much throughout the novel is unknown as there is virtually no time spent on third-person exposition.  We learn about the characters entirely through dialogue and Laeghaire's internal observations of the responses he sees, and Laeghaire is not a poetic man prone to drawn-out soliloquies.  He is a sharp-tongued rascal, and is willing to incur the wrath of lords and ladies, not least one William the (...) who has his eyes set on the conquest of England.    Laeghaire is a mighty swordsman who cares little for his own life, which of course makes him virtually unbeatable in battle.  As willing to cut down a surly subordinate as the enemy, Laeghaire builds a reputation for fierce brutality that surprisingly wins him the adoration of his men.  Similarly, Laeghaire treats his woman, Hilde, with contempt -- he responds to her \\"I love you's\\" with \\"That's good.\\"  While Laeghaire and Hilde have three children together, this is a family unit condemned to unhappy endings rather than a ride into the sunset.    As the novel builds towards the invasion of England and the Battle of Hastings in 1066, Holland's tale grows more complex as the nomadic Laeghaire must confront the burdens of his successes -- by helping William win the crown of England, he has won the right to a lordship and lands for his family, but does Laeghaire want this?  What indeed does he want, besides to kill?  These difficult questions do not allow for easy answers, and Holland refuses to provide them.    While the spare prose provides for several powerful scenes, the novel also keeps the reader at arm's length a little bit.  Laeghaire is not anaccessible character, and his aloofness keeps the other characters at a distance as well because the book is told from his perspective.  Accordingly, this book does not reach the heights of, say, Sharon Kay Penman, Colleen McCullouch, Conn Iggulden, or Bernard Cornwell.    A fast-moving novel tracking an intriguing anti-hero in Laeghaire, \\"The Firedrake\\" is a fun, fast read that fans of medieval historical fiction will enjoy.	2005-04-21
US	51070201	R3JI7KYELC01IU	006015277X	225655841	Good King Harry	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Riveting Account of the Crushing Weight of Royalty	Denise Giardina's \\"Good King Harry\\" is an in-depth exploration of one of England's most beloved characters and kings, Henry V.  A comet who briefly streaked across the sky of northwest Europe, \\"Good King Harry\\" was a man who knew little of defeat yet experienced much loss, a man who bent his knee to no man but gave his soul to his beloved Welsh lass, Merryn, and a man who sought to bring peace with the sword. <br /> <br />Told in the first person (the language is more archaic, and slightly less accessible, than that used by other authors of medieval historical fiction such as Sharon Kay Penman or Bernard Cornwell) by Harry himself, \\"Good King Harry\\" spends as much time on Harry as a youth as it does as king.  The eldest son of a warrior king, Harry is a bitter disappointment as he prefers wrestling and racing to the noble joust . . . and he also has the temerity to enjoy a little book-learnin'.  The father-son disputes between king and prince are packed with as much baggage as any parent-sibling rivalry, only also with the added threat that father and son are capable of bringing swords to bear.  Harry spends much of his youth balanced on the razor's edge between wilful disobedience and treason, and this battle weighs the otherwise radiant spirit down. <br /> <br />True, Harry does find his Falstaff in Sir John Oldcastle, who may not be as wondrous a character as Shakespeare's creation but is still a worthy comrade in cups as Harry raids the brothels and taverns of England.  This relationship sours in the end, but not as expected . . . and it is a bitter schism indeed.  Still, we get a lot of wenching from our beloved Prince Hal, and Giardina does not shy away from Harry diving into various beds and bottles.   <br /> <br />Most of us know our Henry V from Shakespeare, and Giardina's Henry is true to Shakespeare's creation, even if not nearly as poetic.  Her novel takes a broader scope of Henry's life, and through this wider expanse we meet Henry's true love.  The Prince of Wales reluctantly goes to war in Wales to bring the rebels to heel, and in the course of doing so develops a love for his fellow Welshmen, and in particular for a Welsh maid, Merryn.  A hotly contested love, Merryn is as fiery a spirit as Henry and not burdened by the weight of nobility.  Giardina creates a romance for the ages with these two, and their bitter early parting is the most moving passage in the book.   <br /> <br />Harry, as we all know, eventually becomes king and raids France.  The Shakespearean Henry V is not nearly as conflicted about this raid as Giardina's, and these heavy doubts make Henry a wonderfully conflicted character.  Giardina can write a battle scene very well, although she does not spend as much time with the battles as, say, Bernard Cornwell, she still throws a bunch of action at the reader.   <br /> <br />But the high points of the book are easily Henry's emotional peaks and valleys as he contemplates his loves and his losses and the heavy price a king must pay to lead his nation.  All in all, \\"Good King Harry\\" depicts a wonderful man who achieves great things -- some of them terrible, some of them astounding, but all of them great.  While not the best historical fiction you can pick up, this is still an excellent book that will please fans of the Shakespearean Prince Hal/Henry V as well as those who have never experienced the Bard's take.  A worthy choice.	2005-04-19
US	51070201	R3B5L4M2ENWSGK	0312185758	80867101	Excalibur (Warlord Chronicles)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Titanic Climax to Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles	Bernard Cornwell's \\"Excalibur,\\" the third and final novel in his \\"Warlord Chronicles\\" trilogy, brings an excellent series to a tremendously satisfying close. <br /> <br />Fans of Cornwell's fiction will have all the usual buttons pushed -- unsurpassed battle scenes, fierce melancholy as good friends are lost, savage joy as evil foes are vanquished, vivid depictions of hardscrabble daily life in the Dark Ages, astounding scenes of magic and wizardry, and above all, the unbreakable bonds of true friends and true loves.  For Cornwell, there's even quite a bit of humor -- Merlin is a wonderfully cynical old coot, and Cornwell depicts the trammels of seasickness as well as anyone.  <br /> <br />Still narrated by Derfel, in the present-day a one-handed old man reluctantly wearing the chains of Christianity, \\"Excalibur\\" remains first and last the tale of Arthur.  In Cornwell's telling, Arthur was never actually anointed \\"King of the Britons,\\" but he was their king in all but title.  A savage warrior who dreamed of peace, a mighty swordsman who wanted nothing more than a simple home and hall, Cornwell's Arthur is a man worthy of his legends.   <br /> <br />He is also a man with a lot on his plate.  Merlin seeks to bring the Gods back to Britain and to drive the Christian God away -- possibly even willing to throw Arthur's son away as a sacrifice.  (You will never read tales of Sir Gawain the same way again, by the way.)  Nimue, Derfel's former love, is impatient with Merlin's efforts and is eager to topple Merlin from his post as the mightiest Druid in Britain . . . by any means necessary.  Lancelot remains a traitorous foe.  Mordred rules, but hates Arthur -- as do Arthur's twin sons.  Guinevere is back in all her seductive glory.  And the Saxons are marching. <br /> <br />\\"Excalibur\\" is also Derfel's tale, and through Derfel's eyes we see the joy and sorrow that comes from being Arthur's right arm.  We finally learn the reason why Derfel has lost his hand, and we see in Derfel the exemplar of a true family man.  Derfel may not be in the Arthurian legends, but he should have been! <br /> <br />The key to any tale of King Arthur is to tell of his mysterious departure to Avalon, perhaps to return one day.  Cornwell's version is spell-binding, filling the reader with a wracking hope that, some day, England's mightiest hero will return to us and bring us back, if not Camelot, the epitome of nobility and grace.  Wow!  A must for the library!	2005-04-14
US	51070201	R1RSDR35L8BHZA	0385336624	384300097	The Death of Kings (Emperor, Book 2)	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Ahistorical Historical Fiction . . . but a Fun Read	I was not a huge fan of Conn Iggulden's, \\"The Gates of Rome,\\" his first novel in his planned four-volume \\"Emperor\\" series, in which he fictionalizes the life and times of Julius Caesar.  He took enormous historical liberties with his tale, and his conceit of keeping the identities of his protagonists (Julius Caesar and his friend-turned-assassin Brutus) secret didn't really work.   <br /> <br />Iggulden's second novel in the \\"Emperor\\" series, \\"The Death of Kings,\\" is a much more enjoyable read.  Caesar and Brutus are now young men soldiering for Rome, and Iggulden has a knack for writing battle scenes and depicting the soldier's life.  Not as poetic as Steven Pressfield, nor quite as violent as Bernard Cornwell, Iggulden is nevertheless capable of spinning a riveting tale.  From his opening scene of a night raid on a rebellious Greek city to the climactic battle against Spartacus, Iggulden throws the reader pell-mell into the chaos of battle. <br /> <br />Iggulden also has a command of the realities of daily life in the Roman world.  It's refreshing to see history's great figures dealing with the frustrations and agonies of the real world just as we all do -- from pulled muscles to tormenting flies to the pangs of a romance that isn't working.  All too often, authors make their protagonists super-human, and Iggulden enjoyably refuses to play this game.  Further, without going overboard on the historical details, Iggulden reminds the reader that we are reading about a world centuries gone, but it was nevertheless a civilized world with its own craft and technology. <br /> <br />The novel also gains as Iggulden reduces the elements of mysticism from the first novel.  In Book One, Iggulden introduced the entirely fictional (at least as far as I know) healer/mystic Cabera, and his magical powers were out-of-place in Caesar's story.  While Cabera is back for Book 2, he generally seems to be more of a man of wisdom and learning than of magic, and that generally helps thenovel. <br /> <br />You cannot read Iggulden's works as a fictionalized-yet-historically-accurate account of Caesar's life.  Sure, some of the major points are there, such as Caesar's capture by and eventual destruction of the pirates (one of the most enjoyable sections of the book).  But, as Iggulden acknowledges in his author's note, he made several major departures from the historical record.  Sulla was not murdered by Caesar's friend, Caesar did not slay Mithridates, and there is no evidence that Caesar ever met Spartacus.  But these deviations are not a weakness -- Iggulden is trying to tell a rollicking story of the ancient world, and for the most part he succeeds, and succeeds very well.   <br /> <br />Not as epic as Colleen McCullouch's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series, Iggulden's \\"Emperor\\" series is nevertheless shaping up as a thrilling, enjoyable spin through the fall of the Roman Republic and the rise of one of history's titanic figures.  Here's looking forward to book 3! <br /> <br />	2005-04-08

While historical fiction is generally dominated by novels surrounding the largest figures in history (Julius Caesar, Hannibal of Carthage, Elizabeth I, Cleopatra, etc.), some of the greatest joys in the genre can be found in stories about lesser-known-but-worthy figures.  Robert the Bruce is such a character.  Inheriting a noble struggle for freedom against tyranny from the immortal William Wallace (of \\"Braveheart\\" fame), Robert the Bruce succeeded where his forebears failed, and he did so in grand style. <br /> <br />But \\"The Great Scot\\" does not carry the day.  The narrator of the piece is a young man (David) who, as a lad, becomes the Bruce's page. Inexplicably, the Bruce places a huge amount of trust in the boy, who rises to become one of the Bruce's most indispensable men -- although this rise is explained more by the boy's mere presence and devout loyalty than through any great accomplishment on David's part.  So far, so-so.  But the style of the narration is flat, methodical, and without much insight.  In general, the story is a series of \\"And then this happened . . .\\" followed by, \\"the Bruce said this,\\" and \\"we were all swayed by the Bruce,\\" and \\"she smiled at the Bruce.\\"  It gets tedious -- even the famous battle of Bannockburn, where the Scots wiped out a much larger English force, is told with little more than a rote recitation of events.  David is also not around for many of the key events in the novel, which are told to him by folks who are as incapable of spinning a yarn as our narrator.   <br /> <br />When comparing this novel to other recent works of historical fiction -- see, for example, David Anthony Durham's \\"Pride of Carthage,\\" or Bernard Cornwell's \\"The Last Kingdom\\" -- \\"The Great Scot\\" becomes more of a tedious slog to the finish rather than an enjoyable trek through a bygone era.   <br /> <br />There is little to learn about the Bruce, aswell, other than he's a good swordsman, a champion with the ladies, prone to the occasional illness, and a firm believer in freedom.  None of these traits are surprising, and the Bruce appears to be much more of a cardboard cut-out of a hero than a true man of greatness (he does not compare favorably to Durham's Hannibal, for example, or with Sharon Kay Penman's Henry Curtmantle, or with the Julius Caesar of Conn Iggulden's \\"Gates of Rome\\" series -- or any character written by Colleen McCullouch).  <br /> <br />Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh with this review, but I had high hopes for \\"The Great Scot.\\"  And these were not met.  For fans of historical fiction set in the British Isles, there are many other more worthy selections.	2005-04-04

Virtually ignored by Rome, the Wall is undermanned and festering with corruption.  An imperial investigator, Draco, is interviewing the survivors, both Roman and Celtic, of a recent attack on the Wall and attempting to solve the riddle of what has become of the beautiful Valeria.  Sent to the Wall as political currency to be the bride of the commanding officer -- a stereotypical uptight Roman soldier named Marcus -- Valeria apparently sparked a conflagration that roared on both sides of the Wall and brought death and despair to hundreds.<br /><br />Using the investigation as a framing device, the story is told mainly in flash-backs, although these flashbacks are often narrated from a perspective that the interviewee would never have had.  Still, this is a minor quibble, as Dietrich tells a complex tale of love, deceit, and murder.<br /><br />Valeria finds herself amidst a \\"love square,\\" in which she, her husband Marcus, the gruff tribune Galba, and the romantic Celt Arden form the four points.  (Valeria is such a prize that a mere love triangle could not contain her.)  While Valeria arrives at the Wall convinced of her Roman-ness, she soon finds herself intrigued by the wilderness north of the Wall . . . and also less-than-satisfied by her husband, who pursues romantic endeavors with a mechanical sense of duty rather than any real passion.<br /><br />Dietrich writes movingly about the inherent conflict between Roman civilization and the Celtic barbarians, but this is generally told from Valeria's perspective.  As is expected in works like this, Valeria finds that the Roman side is actually quite uncivilized, while the Celts are surprisingly unbarbaric in many ways.  And, of course, she discovers hidden strengths she never knew she had, and she also discovers her true heart's desire.<br /><br />I'd place this novel closer to the bodice-ripping works of Elizabeth Chadwick than the more historical works of Sharon Kay Penman or Colleen McCullouch -- while Dietrich has undeniably done his research, his focus is more on getting the reader inside Valeria's heart than transporting the reader to another historical period.  And while Dietrich can definitely write a battle scene to rival Bernard Cornwell, the focus of this story is definitely romance.  For some, that could elevate the story to five stars, but for me, it made for a pleasant, enjoyable read.  And that ain't bad.ys.

While perhaps not the most convoluted or original of detective stories out there, Rowland successfully recreates a bygone Japan and casts the reader back to a distant, mysterious place and time.    Our hero, Sano Ichiro, is a \\"modern-day\\" samurai, which means that he must forge his destiny in the Japanese bureaucracy rather than on the battlefield.  Sure, the samurai still wear the customary two swords, but far too many samurai are corrupt sycophants seeking success through climbing the corporate ladder rather than pursuing a true vision of the Code of Bushido.  This frustrates Sano, who is both dedicated to the truth and to his martial heritage.    Unfortunately for Sano, his family is rather poor, and has used its moderate contacts to get Sano a position as a mid-level detective in the vast police force.  In this role, obedience is valued over initiative, and Sano chafes at this restriction.  He has been charged with \\"investigating\\" a \\"shinju,\\" a ritual double-suicide of star-crossed lovers.  By \\"investigating,\\" I mean \\"rubber-stamp\\" the pre-existing conclusions of his superiors.       But the facts do not match up with this conclusion, and soon Sano is disobeying direct orders and placing his career, his family, and his very life in jeopardy as he seeks to solve what appears to be a heinous crime.  Through it all, Sano encounters resistance and hostility from his superiors, even in the face of mounting evidence that something is rotten in Tokyo.      This is far from a grand epic, and the law of economy of characters means that there are only so many candidates for villainy, and as a result the mystery really isn't all that confounding . . . although it is riveting.  The real strength of the novel comes from Rowland's mastery of the time period and her precise, economical descriptions of Sano's world.  Brief yet powerful descriptions createa completely realized, convincing world for Sano to inhabit, and the reader is always well-grounded in these foreign surroundings.      A heck of a first novel, and a wonderful start to what promises to be a very enjoyable series.  Check it out.	2005-03-22

Justin is educated, resourceful, clever, and, as he admits, lucky.  As a result, he's the perfect choice to serve Queen Eleanor.  Beset by a tide of troubles in her later life, Eleanor in 1193 is trying to ransom her beloved son, King Richard, currently held captive in Germany.  While the call has gone out across the realm for the ransom to be compiled, many less-than-loyal subjects desire to keep the ransom for themselves.  The leading candidate for betrayal comes from within the royal family, as Eleanor's son John has no desire to see Richard return from confinement. <br /> <br />And so it is no great surprise when a valuable shipment of coin and luxurious wool (worth its weight in gold) goes missing en route from Wales.  Eleanor immediately dispatches Justin to this remote, wild kingdom, charged with recovering the lost ransom.  Justin soon finds himself in Welsh intrigues as wild and tangled as the Welsh countryside, and there's more than a wee spot of murder afoot, too. <br /> <br />Along the way, Penman feasts the reader on a host of precise details that evoke the time period, but does so in a highly readable fashion.  We also delight in learning more about Justin, including meeting some players from his misspent youth.  <br /> <br />An entertaining mystery (very realistic in its details) populated by a vivid cast of characters, \\"Dragon's Lair\\" keeps you guessing from page to page.  A very enjoyable read!	2005-03-16
US	51070201	R1YRH5KQA9O2ZV	0553579908	153810577	A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The Floodgates of War are Opened	In \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" George R.R. Martin's first novel in his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, the tenuous peace of the Seven Kingdoms was shattered with the murder of King Robert and his right-Hand man, Ned Stark.  A mad scramble for power ensued, both on the battlefield and in the royal courts, but despite carnage, betrayal, and death, nothing was resolved, and the novel ended with an already war-torn nation contemplating its riven future.   <br /> <br />\\"A Clash of Kings\\" spins the complex yarn of the various pieces in this magnificent chess game . . . and one wonders how Martin himself can keep things straight.  Like the first novel, \\"Clash\\" uses each chapter to tell the story from a different character's perspective.  This daring scheme works, and works well.  Martin gives each character a unique voice as well as perspective on events, and he is even able to \\"simplify\\" the story whenever a younger person is providing that perspective.  The scheme also works because as Martin jumps from character to character, each chapter offers another opportunity for a tantalizing cliff-hanger.  Sure, it can be difficult to say sayonara to a character for 80-odd pages, but the reunions between reader and character are fun. <br /> <br />The Seven Kingdoms are a martial land, to be sure, and most of the characters are rather grim -- not surprising, given the circumstances.  Fortunately, Martin allows the dwarf, Tyrion Lannister, to tell much of this story, and Tyrion is a blessedly conflicted combination of Falstaff, MacBeth, and Dr. Evil, and the reader can delight in Tyrion's clever wickedness and his shreds of honor.  The novel allows few opportunities for humor, but Tyrion insists on finding them even under the most dire of circumstances. <br /> <br />Martin proves himself to be a master of writing vivid battle scenes as well as dialogue, as the epic battle of Blackwater comes to horrifying life.   <br /> <br />And through it all, while the Seven Kingdoms are torn apart bycivil war, the feuding warlords ignore two separate-yet-lethal looming threats -- the rise of the Dragonqueen in the lands across the sea, and the growing drumbeat of war rising in the North, where the undead Others are emerging from legend.   <br /> <br />Combining the mythic scope of Tolkein with the crisp writing style of Bernard Cornwell, Martin continues to build his masterpiece, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\"  While it may stress your patience with its 700-odd pages, a reader should definitely read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" before diving into \\"A Clash of Kings\\" -- this is a story much too rich to cut corners.  A must read!	2005-03-04

Ye gods.<br /><br />That's just about all one can say upon completion of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" the first book in George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Amazed, aghast, and astounded, I am bereft, wondrously spent.<br /><br />Where to begin?  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" may be read as a fantastic parallel to the historical English civil war between the Houses of York and Lancaster, but the novel truly stands on its own.<br /><br />Martin plops the reader down into a world recovering from a titanic civil war.  Robert the Usurper is now King Robert, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms that comprise a land that bears a strong resemblance of England.  But this is a land of warlords, where knights wear fantastic, regal armor and clash at the drop of a hat.  The land itself is martial, what with geographic names such as \\"the Trident,\\" \\"the Bite,\\" and \\"the Bloody Gate.\\"  And Robert is ill-suited to govern his unruly warlords (after all, these are the men who fought a civil war -- a strong hand is needed to keep these guys in line), and is more suited to the hunt than the throne.<br /><br />The Starks and the Lannisters are two of the leading noble families in the realm, and like the two bullies on the block, sooner or later they are going to have to fight.  The Starks, who rule the Northlands, epitomize all the traits of nobility and loyalty (including, to their sorrow, a bit of naivete), while the Lannisters bring a realpolitik ruthlessness to their worldview.<br /><br />Simultaneously, the \\"dragonspawn\\" heirs of the recently toppled king have fled across the sea to the land of the Dothraki, where the brother hopes to raise an army by wedding his sister to a Ghengis Khan clone.  While occupying far fewer pages in this massive novel than the Stark-Lannister intrigues, this subplot is no less riveting.<br /><br />And perhaps most ominously of all, \\"winter is coming.\\"  In the Seven Kingdoms, summers and winters can last for years, and a long winter is on the horizon.  And along with this winter are harbingers of the Others, who are fearsome undead creatures who live in the northern wastelands beyond the Wall -- sort of the Great Wall of England, made almost entirely out of ice.<br /><br />The great fantasy series plop the reader down into a fully realized world with its own history and mythology.  George R.R. Martin has created the most vividly realized alternate world since Tolkien created Middle Earth, and his novel soars because of it.<br /><br />You'll find it all here.  Romance, warfare, humor, grief, intrigue, deceit, murder, salvation, love, and betrayal . . . all set between the book-ends of an ominous prologue and a wondrous final chapter that will have you eagerly diving into Book 2, \\"A Clash of Kings.\\"<br /><br />As a character in the tale says, \\"in the game of thrones, you win or you die.\\"  Martin has indeed created a world and characters worth fighting and dying for.

US	51070201	RG5DNOSIDLVT7	0385506031	519808491	Pride of Carthage: A Novel of Hannibal	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Novel Rises and Falls with Hannibal	David Anthony Durham's \\"Pride of Carthage\\" is a magnificent undertaking.  A monumental effort to tell the story of one of history's favorite near-misses triumphs as long as it focuses on Hannibal's triumphant campaign against Rome, but loses a bit of steam as Hannibal's ultimate victory slips from his grasp.   <br /> <br />Like many, I have a weakness for tales of the people who fall just short of their goals -- whether it be Hector, Romeo and Juliet, or the gang of doomed fishermen from \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" these stories of near-triumph are exquisitely moving.  Hannibal may be history's number one failed contender.  Had he defeated Rome, the course of world history would have been changed forever, as the rule of the Mediterranean would have moved to the continent of Africa from Europe.  As it was, Rome as the victor remained the exemplar of Western Civ for several centuries.   <br /> <br />The novel kicks off with Hannibal itching to make war on Rome and restore Carthage to its rightful place.  He assembles a delightfully exotic army of various African and European nations and commences the conquest of Spain.  Success after success soon follow, and before Rome realizes it, the demon Hannibal has brought his army through the Alps and is raiding the countryside.  Durham brings an excitement to these scenes that makes \\"Pride\\" a difficult novel to put down.  One of the most entertaining aspects of these early chapters is Durham's depiction of Roman hubris -- several Roman leaders learn, when it is too late, that Hannibal is a commander to be feared.   <br /> <br />More than a novel of Hannibal, \\"Pride\\" brings together several different plot lines and perspectives.  These are generally healthy for the novel, as Durham fleshes out Hannibal's world and we see daily life for the \\"average\\" soldier and even the camp followers.  Perhaps not all of these plot threads are tied up as well as one would like, but all in all this makes for a well-rounded novel that is more refreshing than many other novels that never leave the command tent, so intent is their focus on the hero. <br /> <br />As history tells us, Hannibal ultimately loses the Second Punic War, bested by the young Roman general Publius Scipio.  Unfortunately, Scipio waxes as the novel wanes -- it's almost as if once Durham could not write any more about Hannibal's victories, he loses interest and wants to bring things to a rapid close.  As a result, the build-up to the climactic battle at Zama and the novel's conclusion with Hannibal's heart-breaking return to Carthage feel somewhat truncated.   <br /> <br />Still, this novel does a great job of noting that there were human beings on both sides of the Second Punic War, as well as heroes of note.  Durham resists the temptation of some who tell the story of the \\"losing side\\" to demonize the ultimate victors -- see Michael Curtis Ford's \\"The Last King\\" about Mithridates for an example of this treatment.  All in all, \\"Pride\\" is a well-written novel of great ambition, and the fact that the ending does not satisfy as much as the earlier chapters is no great criticism.  A solid entry into the library for any fan of historical fiction.	2005-02-17
US	51070201	R2PT5HLZ47GXOG	0670032034	443291358	Dissolution	Books	4	8	8	N	N	"Dissolution" Transports Reader to Harsh, Vibrant World	Many novels set in older times suffer from two flaws -- regardless of the ostensible setting of the novel, it comes across as shockingly modern, and the hero/heroine is invariably a modern spirit who could easily be portrayed by an uber-attractive movie star like Brad Pitt or Gwyneth Paltrow.  These novels may be entertaining, but they often come across as less than authentic.    C.J. Sansom's \\"Dissolution\\" avoids both of these pitfalls.  For one, Sansom's protagonist is a true character of his times.  Matthew Shardlake is a hunchbacked (!) lawyer in the service of Thomas Cromwell, the right hand man of England's King Henry VIII.  The novel is set in 1537, during the height of the English Reformation, and Shardlake is a man clearly caught up in the spiritual tumult of his times.  Convinced he is serving both a man of honor and a cause that is just, Shardlake is also haunted by his memory of the execution of Anne Boleyn.  But whatever sympathies Shardlake may have for those less fortunate than he, he is also a man who is proud of his Reformist beliefs, his loyalty to his king, and his own accomplishments.  Rather than an unbelievable 21st century man living in 16th century England, Shardlake is a convincing and compelling man of his times.    Sansom also conveys a masterful grasp of England in 1537.  Religious strife tears apart the fabric of the country as the Reformist King Henry seeks to topple the Papist monastaries.  King's Commissioners, such as Shardlake, are feared for their absolute power.  From his vivid descriptions of the snowbound countryside to his easy command of life in an English monastary to his characters' antiquated-yet-understandable jargon, \\"Dissolution\\" is a compelling read.      Sansom has also given us an intriguing mystery.  One of the King's Commissioners has been foully murdered at a seaside monastary, beheaded in the Church with satanic imagery.  Shardlake is sent to investigate by Cromwell.  Wheels turn within wheels as Shardlake sets out to solve the murder as well as advance the King's political agenda vis-a-vis the monastaries, and Shardlake also uncovers other evidence that all is not well at the monastary, even if one discounts the murdered Commissioner.    An excellent who-dunnit, \\"Dissolution\\" contains sufficient red herrings and false leads, not to mention a few action scenes, to keep you turning pages long after you intended to set it down.  A tremendous first novel -- dive in and enjoy!	2005-02-09

But to the frustration of many, Arthur's main goal is to support the divine right of kings, and the High King is Mordred, a petulant, vile young man.  Nobody but Arthur will support him, but since Arthur hopes against hope that Mordred will grow into his noble position, everyone reluctantly lets Mordred sit on the throne. <br /> <br />But even though Mordred is the High King, other kings abound.  Lancelot is also a king, and Arthur also feels great pangs of guilt for failing to come to Lancelot's aid as his kingdom was sacked in \\"The Winter King.\\"  Blinded by his guilt to Lancelot's various faults -- including raging vanity -- Arthur continues to support Lancelot against all reason.   <br /> <br />Of course, neither Mordred nor Lancelot are particularly grateful for Arthur's support, and Arthur will soon learn to his great horror that loyalty and self-sacrifice are not always rewarded.   <br /> <br />This being Cornwell, these political conflicts are often resolved by spear and sword, and \\"Enemy of God\\" is replete with numerous battle scenes, and nobody writes a better battle scene than Mr. Cornwell.  Fans of his other works will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />The title for the novel comes as a bit of a shock for those familiar with the Arthur legend.  In most tales, Arthur is a Christian king, and his Knights of the Round Table are examplars of Christian might.  Cornwell's Arthur, however, is a pagan . . . although his religious convictions are lukewarm at best.  This Arthur puts his faith in men rather than gods (or God).  Unfortunately for Arthur, the Christians of his time (we're rapidly approaching 500 A.D.) are convinced that the Rapture is on the horizon, and they must scour the land and cleanse it of all pagans -- whether through conversion or through slaughter.   <br /> <br />At times like this, Arthur's policy of benign tolerance is completely out of step, and it leads Arthur into several errors of judgment that have catastrophic consequences. <br /> <br />Most of the major elements of the classic Arthur tales are present.  Tristan and Isolde's famous tragic tale of lost love occupies several pages.   Fans of Merlin will see their favorite Druid swing from triumph to despair and back again.  And Queen Guinevere's betrayal of Arthur with Lancelot may be different than one expects, but it is no less shocking or heartbreaking.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Enemy of God\\" is a thought-provoking, historically informed take on the Arthur legend, and is a worthy read for fans of historical fiction or the Arthur legends.  Check it out, but only after reading \\"The Winter King\\" first so you can have Cornwell's backstory for all the characters, rather than working from your presuppositions taken from other works.	2005-02-07

In \\"The Queen's Man,\\" her first such novel, Penman introduced Justin de Quincy to the world.  The bastard son of a bishop, Justin is a man of talent but no means until fate brought him into the confidence of England's Queen Eleanor.  Through courage, wit, and loyalty, Justin rose mightily in the eyes of both the royal court and with several of his \\"more common\\" friends . . . and made a few enemies in the bargain. <br /> <br />In \\"Cruel as the Grave,\\" set in the early spring of 1193, immediately after \\"The Queen's Man\\" ends, Justin reaps the fruit of his success.  Now an honored and trusted member of the Queen's inner circle, Justin must undertake several risky ventures to help Eleanor ransom her beloved kidnapped son, Richard Lionheart, king of England -- held in an Austrian prison cell.  He must also help Eleanor in a high-stakes chess match --with the throne of England as the prize -- with her cunning younger son, John (dubbed by many, \\"the Prince of Darkness,\\" and deservedly so).  Since John is one of the enemies Justin made in \\"The Queen's Man,\\" Justin's life is in considerable peril. <br /> <br />Justin must also cope with his new-found fame as a crime solver par excellence with his less-royal but no less demanding friends.  A beautiful young woman is found murdered in a local churchyard, and the sons of a local merchant are implicated.  Justin is forced to look into the murder, and soon learns that suspects and motives abound in this grisly affair.   <br /> <br />Penman balances these two plot lines expertly, and the action sweeps from the streets of London to the courtroom of the palace to the siege of Windsor Castle.  Penman writes with her trademark clarity, equally at home with a battle scene as with friends bantering over drinks in the alehouse.  (Although fans of carnage would be better suited reading Bernard Cornwell's various works - Penman does not linger long over the violence.) <br /> <br />True to her last murder mystery, Penman injects \\"Cruel as the Grave\\" with more humor than her historical epics, and the novel is much shorter, as well (230-odd pages).  While these novels are (almost) entirely fictional, they are fantastic opportunities to delve deeper into Penman's captivating treatment of Queen Eleanor's England.  Check it out!   <br /> <br />Note -- while some \\"sequels\\" can be read without reading earlier novels in the series, \\"Cruel as the Grave\\" will be much more enjoyable for those who have already read \\"The Queen's Man.\\"  (I would also recommend reading \\"While Christ and His Saints Slept\\" and \\"Time and Chance\\" first, so the reader can learn the back-story of Queen Eleanor before reading these murder mysteries, which are set in the twilight of her reign -- but reading those two novels is not as essential as reading \\"The Queen's Man,\\" because Justin de Quincy does not play a role in the other works.)	2005-02-02

More witty writing, more sarcastic characters, more over-the-top action, and more of everyone's favorite 13-year old criminal mastermind. <br /> <br />Set essentially a year after the first novel, Artemis is chafing from getting one of his heart's desires -- the return of his beloved mother's sanity.  Who wouldn't rather have their mom lucid rather than delusional?  Not Artemis, even though her return to normalcy has wiped out Artemis' beloved autonomy.  So young Artemis opens the novel in boarding school with a hilarious encounter with an overmatched guidance counselor.  (Really -- how much guidance does a criminal mastermind need?) <br /> <br />A counseling session is cut short when a ransom email arrives, hinting that Artemis' departed (and presumed, by many, to be dead) father is alive in the Russian Arctic.  Young Artemis instantly commences a rescue mission . . . a rescue mission with a vengeance, to be sure. <br /> <br />But this would not be an \\"Artemis Fowl\\" novel without the faerie world.  Our heroes, Captain Holly Short and Commander Root are back, as is the centaur computer genius Foaly, uncover what appears to be a goblin plot to smuggle contraband weapons.  And this plot has a more sinister intent, one hidden even from the goblins . . .  <br /> <br />And what else would an escaped dwarf thief, Mulch, do besides hang out in Los Angeles, stealing Academy Awards?   <br /> <br />In many ways, none of the characters have changed.  Short is still a derring-do pilot and field agent.  Root is still in a perpetual fury.  Butler, the bodyguard, is back, with a penchant for cracking skulls.  Foaly is still as caustic as he is brilliant.  And so on and so forth. <br /> <br />Outlandish plot twists, fueled by Colfer's astounding imagination, keep the pages turning fast and furious.  Will the goblins be thwarted?  Will Artemis save his father?  Will the ultimate villain be caught? <br /> <br />Count on losing several hours of sleep as you read \\"just one more chapter.\\"  Count on laughing out loud at brilliant dialogue and terrible puns.

These books are magnificent, titanic books that throw the reader headlong into the power struggles among the \\"movers and shakers\\" of the British Isles and across the Channel in France.  Similar to Colleen McCullough's \\"The Masters of Rome\\" series, these novels are replete with vivid battles and court dramas. <br /> <br />With \\"The Queen's Man,\\" Penman takes on a slightly different genre -- the murder mystery.  Fans of her other works will be pleased to note that Penman has not lost her talent for transporting the reader back to the England of Queen Eleanor (the novel takes place in the winter of 1192-93, after Eleanor's husband Henry II has shuffled off the mortal coil).  But while novels such as \\"While Christ and His Saints Slept\\" had a certain amount of melancholy that results from a civil war, \\"The Queen's Man\\" is a much more humorous, light-hearted affair, as if Penman knows she's taking on lighter fare. <br /> <br />Well, lighter to an extent -- this *is* a murder mystery, after all.  King Richard is missing, lost somewhere after departing for the Crusades from Venice.  Justin de Quincy, the educated bastard of a respected bishop, nearly thwarts a murder, and the dying victim entrusts a mysterious letter to Justin, a letter that concerns Richard that must be brought to the Queen . . . a blood-soaked letter, to be sure. <br /> <br />A worthy diamond-in-the-rough, Justin soon finds himself \\"the Queen's Man,\\" charged by Eleanor with tracking down who murdered the letter carrier.  Penman may be writing her first mystery, but she is a natural, peppering the tale with red herrings, bloody fights, rampant duplicity, and a bevy of motives.  Chock full of vivid characters and cliff-hangers, \\"The Queen's Man\\" is a thrill for both fans of murder mysteries and historical fiction.	2005-01-27

Fans of the Grail Quest series, or \\"Stonehenge,\\" will instantly recognize Cornwell's trademark style -- clear, concise prose, spare-yet-functional dialouge, and an unflinching eye for both the joys (rare) and terrors (common) of medieval life.   <br /> <br />Narrated by Derfel, \\"The Winter King\\" kicks off the tale of Arthur's ascendancy to become King of the Britons.  Set in the Dark Ages, Britain is a raging cauldron of conflicts.  Followers of the pagan gods clash with the annoyingly resilient new crowd, the Christians.  Saxons fight Britons, Irish fight Britons, and Britons fight Britons.  Uther, the dying king, has no son and his grandson, Mordred, is born a cripple and is at the mercy of vicious warlords who want nothing more than to assume the throne. <br /> <br />Into this maelstrom strides Arthur, an amiable colossus who harbors an almost Clinton-like need to be loved.  That is, unless he's tossing Excalibur around, which Arthur does with unbridled ferocity.  Through Derfel's eyes, we see that Arthur is a man truly capable of inspiring adoration among those around him. <br /> <br />But nevertheless, this Arthur is a man, not a myth, not a legend.  Cornwell's style is perfect for his aim, which is to humanize the man who has inspired so many myths, tales, and songs.  Cornwell does this both by giving Arthur some very human failings (the aforementioned need to be loved is one, and an impulsive streak a mile wide is another) and by skewering some of Arthur's mythical comrades.  Rather than the honorable, indomitable warrior of legend, Cornwell's Lancelot is a handsome coward who knows the value of good p.r. -- if you value your legacy, befriend the poets! <br /> <br />Throughout the novel, Arthur's ascendancy is much in doubt.  Not only has he sworn a mighty oath to see Mordred king, virtually every other monarch in the tale is out to get Arthur and put him in his place.  This makes fora rollicking read, particularly since Cornwell -- true to form -- is capable of killing off anybody, anywhere, at any time in this book. <br /> <br />Cornwell has created one truly magnificent character in \\"The Winter King,\\" namely, Merlin.  Merlin is the mightiest Druid in the land -- so powerful that even Christians bow to him.  A schemer, a huckster, yet dangerous as hell, Merlin commands the stage like no other Cornwell character I've read, and one can easily imagine Cornwell smiling as he wrote Merlin's scenes.   <br /> <br />Here's looking forward to the rest of the trilogy!	2005-01-26
US	51070201	R3CK26V17IIAG2	0345461347	258301458	To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Powerful "Through The Eyes Of" Treatment of WWI	Jeff Shaara has written and written well about famous Americans fighting America's wars . . . he has brought the Civil War, the American Revolution, and the Mexican War to life magnificently.   <br /> <br />Fortunately for us, Shaara set his sights on America's involvement in World War I, which is a surprisingly overlooked conflict in America's military history.  After reading \\"To the Last Man,\\" one wonders how WWI can be so neglected -- the events chronicled in Shaara's new novel rival anything that WWII or Vietnam could offer. <br /> <br />True to form, Shaara follows a few characters around as his novel explores the different aspects of the war.  The lion's share of the novel focuses on four men:  General \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force; Raoul Lufbery, one of the first American pilots to fly in combat; Manfred von Richtofen (the Red Baron), the hunter of the skies; and Roscoe Temple, a Marine in the front lines.  Shaara focuses on each character one chapter at a time, and he manages to balance these often-independent storylines very well. <br /> <br />After some brief character exposition and a horrifying introduction to trench warfare through the eyes of an anonymous infantryman, Shaara focuses his story on Lufbery and the Red Baron.  WWI saw the introduction of aircraft to the military as a combat vehicle, and these two men are pioneers in dogfighting. The Red Baron is a hunter's hunter, a killing machine whom Shaara imbues with a noble, reticent humanity (the Baron's scenes with his beloved Great Dane are heartbreaking).   <br /> <br />Lufbery's situation is more complicated.  Isolationist America won't enter this European war, but many Americans realize the plight we will be in if Germany's aggression is not beaten back.  So wealthy Americans send their dollars and a handful of their sons to form the American contingent of the French Air Force.  Initially outclassed by the German pilots and German aircraft, the fledgling Allied air force takes its lumps but quickly learns the game, and Lufbery is a master pilot.  Shaara imbues the dogfighting scenes with a vivid realism that brings the reader into the cockpit. <br /> <br />Shaara also brings the reader into the hangars and the bars where the pilots spend their off-duty hours, and we see the psychic toll on both the Baron and Lufbery as their original cast of comrades grows smaller and smaller, and both men realize what the war is doing to them and their countrymen.  The parallel tales of these two airmen meet a climax at the midpoint of the novel that is truly moving. <br /> <br />The second half of the novel follows General Pershing as he attempts to build an American army out of nothing . . . and in spite of the incompetence back in Washington D.C. and the dueling motives of the European allies.  Pershing's achievements deserve greater recognition than he has received, but Shaara's book is a step in the right direction. <br /> <br />The second half of the novel also follows Marine rifleman Roscoe Temple as he journeys into the front lines and indeed the very teeth of the German army.  Temple begins his sojourn as green as they come, but by the end of the book Temple is a haunted, scarred veteran who understands the vast gulf between a civilian and a veteran.  Temple's tale may be the most powerful of them all, as Temple learns first-hand the shock and horror of what trench warfare can do to your friends, and what that means to your family back home. <br /> <br />Americans need to appreciate WWI more than we do.  Our nation overcame its isolationist tendencies to send millions of young men overseas to fight for soil that was not theirs.  This event laid the groundwork for our massive mobilization in WWII, but WWI was the first time America asserted itself so magnificently on the world stage.  Shaara's novel is a great education for those, like me, who did not appreciate our involvement and the tremendous sacrifices made by so many.	2005-01-19

A black heart, to be sure, but a heart nonetheless. <br /> <br />Eoin Colfer has written a wonderful novel for older children of all ages.  Completely original, \\"Artemis Fowl\\" creates a new world - identical to our own, with the one exception that the faerie world is a thriving technological marvel existing right alongside ours (or, more accurately, underneath).  Many of the book's charms come from Colfer's witty characterizations of life in the faerie world, which is plagued with many of the same problems (traffic jams, computer glitches, ambitious underlings, you name it) as ours. <br /> <br />This faerie world is a rough-and-tumble place, and mercifully not a regurgitated version of (the sainted) J.R.R. Tolkien's mythology.  Tolkien's favorite dwarf Gimli may share a love of gold with Colfer's dwarf Mulch, but the similarities end there.  Trust me -- you will be laughing till your sides hurt when Mulch dispatches a would-be attacker with his most-unusual weaponry!  Elves, sprites, fairies . . . in Colfer's world, they are as likely to resemble General Patton as an overheated travel agent. <br /> <br />Colfer has also given Fowl a sidekick to remember -- the hulking bodyguard Butler.  Fowl and Butler have a special relationship . . . one which can accommodate Butler both dying to save Fowl's neck as striving to break it. <br /> <br />But this novel depends entirely on its villain, young Artemis.  He is a young man who would give James Bond fits - an evil genius smart enough not to give away his plans just because he thinks he has the hero trapped.   <br /> <br />The plot is straightforward -- can Artemis do the impossible?  Can he swipe the faerie gold . . . and live to keep it . . . where everyone else who has tried has died . . . hideously?  You'll be turning the pages well into the wee hours of the morning to find out!	2005-01-11

Tolkien's works recently, in the wake of Peter Jackson's magnificent films, that it was refreshing to simply re-read Tolkien's original tale of Bilbo Baggins.  This marvelous new edition provided the perfect excuse.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" is a classic tale of adventure.  Bilbo Baggins, Esquire, of the Shire, has never done anything outlandish, and is a most esteemable hobbit as a result.  But lo and behold, the wizard Gandalf arrives on his doorstep with thirteen dwarves on a quest for revenge.  Although never made quite clear why or how, Gandalf knows that Bilbo is going on this quest, too, like it or not.  And after a night of dwarvish tales to chill a hobbit's bones, Bilbo finds himself running out his front door on a quest without so much as a pocket-handerchief.<br /><br />Just what is the quest?  The dwarves are refugees from the Lonely Mountain in the East, a mighty dwarf kingdom, that has been ransacked by the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent.  Bilbo is the troop's Burglar, although one imagines that the only thing Bilbo has ever stolen is a nap, or perhaps an extra piece of pie.<br /><br />If you're going to do archetypal stuff, you must do it well.  In \\"The Hobbit,\\" Tolkien sets the gold standard.  His Middle-Earth is a fully realized land full of terrors and wonders, from trolls, goblins, evil wolves, giant spiders (not to mention Smaug or the ultimate nemesis, Gollum) to the shapeshifter Beorn, the Arkenstone, Bard the Archer, Sting, and Gandalf's wizardry on the other (not to mention a certain magic ring).  Tolkien spends as much time on the landscape as he does the action or the dialogue, and his descriptions are so vivid one finds yourself walking alongside Bilbo through his amazing adventures.<br /><br />In contrast to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, which can generally be characterized as a heavy load, \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter.  Tolkien tells this tale using a narrator who cleverly jumps ahead and back in the story to offer hints, clues, and humor . . . just as if your favorite uncle were telling you a tall tale on the couch when you were a wee lad.<br /><br />The story builds, and builds, and builds, but never loses steam.  A tale that must be read, \\"The Hobbit\\" will surely earn a place of honor on your bookshelf.<br /><br />For devotees of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, you will find throughout \\"The Hobbit\\" somewhat veiled references to later events.  A few references are made to \\"the Necromancer,\\" who never really figures in the story but plays, shall we say, a slightly larger role in the trilogy.  A certain magic ring, used by Bilbo to great effect, does not seem to carry all the negative baggage that Bilbo's nephew will associate with it.  And Gollum, well, you know all about Gollum.  (Apparently Tolkein revised \\"The Hobbit\\" after working extensively on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because Gollum unexpectedly became a major player in the trilogy.)<br /><br />And this edition is wonderful, too.  Handsome green leatherette binding with heavy paper makes for a pleasant reading experience, and the artwork and maps (drawn by Tolkien himself!) just adds to the magic.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong giving this book to any Tolkien fan, or keeping it for yourself.story to offer hints, clues, and humor . . . just as if your favorite uncle were telling you a tall tale on the couch when you were a wee lad.<br /><br />The story builds, and builds, and builds, but never loses steam.

Peter David's \\"Sir Apropos of Nothing\\" introduces the titular character, an anti-hero that is equal parts George Castanza and Sir Percival.  Crammed with more biting sarcasm than a Sam Kinison rant, chock full of (oft accidental) derring-do, and replete with enough terrible puns to choke a hippogriff, \\"Apropos\\" is a wonderful read for fans of the fantasy genre.   <br /> <br />(Here's just one sample of the excruciating puns David tosses off so effortlessly -- a bunch of harpies mate with a gang of lepers, giving birth to a brood of insane male harpies . . . the Harpers Bizarre!  As Charlie Brown would say, \\"Aaauuuugghhh!\\") <br /> <br />Be warned -- this book is not for everyone!  Apropos, born lame (but with a full set of teeth and eager to bite) after his mother was gang-raped by seven nights, is a selfish, cynical, unfaithful, back-stabbing conniver and fast-talker, and he's surrounding by more incompetent boobs than you can shake a bastard sword at.  Apropos has few motivations in this life -- avenging his mother's murderer, exacting vengeance on his father, and protecting his own skin.  Oddly enough, he's rather capable and gets to pursue all three across some truly enchanted lands. <br /> <br />It's a general staple of the fantasy genre that our hero, invariably a down-trodden diamond-in-the-rough, will form up a merry little band of eccentric, talented diamonds-in-the-rough and lead them on exciting adventures, generally to their mutual advancement and well-being.  Unfortunately, those who meet Apropos rarely end the day with a smile on their face.  From Apropos' first true friend, the imminent hero Tacit, to the occasionally-insane/occasionally ravishing princess Entipy, to various and sundry knights, kings, and other characters, most finish the novel either dead or gnashing their teeth in frustration at the havoc young Apropos wreaks on their lives.   <br /> <br />David keeps the reader jumping as the tale spins out over nearly 500 pages, but the book neverseems to run out of steam.  Things get a wee bit icky at the end, with some delicate family history coming to the fore, but for the most part this is a side-splitter for those who love the fantasy genre enough to watch it skewered, roasted, and washed down with a hearty dose of bile.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a parallel reference, at the risk of saying \\"If you liked X, you'll love this,\\" allow me to say that if you were a fan of either \\"Bored of the Rings\\" or Piers Anthony's \\"Xanth\\" novels, this book should be right up your alley.	2005-01-05
US	51070201	R1SX9L8HPO9X03	0385500998	489310389	The Virtues of War: A Novel of Alexander the Great	Books	4	2	4	N	N	An Entertaining Treatise on Alexander's Field Battles	I have devoured Steven Pressfield's three previous novels of Greek antiquity -- \\"Gates of Fire,\\" \\"Tides of War,\\" and \\"Last of the Amazons.\\"  Each novel has skillfully balanced romance, battlefield carnage, and an often-times melancholy lament for lost glories and friendships, and I have been compelled to re-read each novel.   <br /> <br />While still writing about ancient Greece, Pressfield has taken a markedly different tack with \\"Virtues of War.\\"  No longer is the narrator a witness/unknown participant in great events - now the narrator is Alexander, the unquestioned marquee player in all of the ancient world.  In many respects, Alexander is a perfect choice.  Even though entire libraries could be devoted to the books written about this man, very little is precisely known about the man from the backwoods of Macedonia who led his invincible army to and past the boundaries of the known (Greek) world.  So even though Pressfield is somewhat constrained by historical events, Alexander offers almost complete freedom as far as his actual thoughts and motivations are concerned. <br /> <br />According to Pressfield, Alexander thought almost exclusively about tactics and strategy.  Indeed, one chapter is almost entirely given over to the maxims of war Alexander decrees to his commanders.  While Pressfield's earlier Greek novels have offered exquisitely detailed, horrifyingly beautiful battle scenes -- which are as well written as any you will read, anywhere, period -- Alexander describes his battles with a relative mechanical quality . . . \\"Parmenio commanded my left flank, Philotas anchored the right, and Black Cleitus spewed profanities next to me . . .\\"  While this may be appropriate -- Alexander undoubtedly had a gift for both strategy and tactics - the battle passages are not as gripping as those in his earlier works. <br /> <br />The choice of Alexander as protagonist also forces Pressfield to make choices, since he has written a lean, mean novel of 368 pages.  One ofAlexander's mightiest achievements was the construction of a half-mile mole, a feat that took over seven months, to lead his successful charge against the island fortress of Tyre.  And yet, Tyre gets barely a mention in \\"Virtues.\\"  Indeed, \\"Virtues\\" spends no time on siege warfare at all, and this absence is difficult to explain, given Alexander's repeated demonstration of genius at the art of siege warfare.   <br /> <br />To be fair, Pressfield could have easily doubled the length of his novel if he went into every aspect of Alexander's military conquests, but some of these omissions are alarming.   <br /> <br />Pressfield, as always, writes with a moving clarity, and while \\"Virtues\\" may not reach the poetic heights of his other Greek novels, Pressfield still exhibits flashes of his poet's soul.  You will read and re-read his brief \\"Sarissa's Song,\\" which may be the best epitaph for Alexander yet written.  <br /> <br />This is a four-star review only because the combination of Pressfield and Alexander offers almost too much potential.  This is a darn good book, but unfortunately, not my favorite of Pressfield's takes on the world of Greek antiquity.	2005-01-03

Barry Eisler's \\"Rain Storm\\" is the third novel in Eisler's hugely entertaining saga of Japanese-American assassin John Rain.  Few authors have Eisler's command over their chosen genre -- from descriptions of exotic locales to bone-cracking fight scenes to the weird paranoid existence of a contract killer, Eisler is a hard-boiled writer with a hard-boiled anti-hero.   <br /> <br />Even into his third book, when so many characters begin to feel a bit stretched (or a bit too super-human), Rain continues to show an evolving human dimension that makes him so darn compelling.  Having chosen a life that depends almost entirely on his ability to be invisible as well as anonymous (a contract killer who specializes in killing targets by \\"natural causes\\" obviously cannot form too many attachments), Rain still carries scars from his romance with the jazz musician Midori in \\"Rain Fall.\\"  Escaping to the beaches of Brazil, both for a long-needed rest as well as an attempt to escape the life of a contract killer, may numb the pain, but the pain is still there.  <br /> <br />And unfortunately for Rain, there are still many out there who cherish his skills, and soon he's back on the job.  Taking flight to the gambling paradise of Macao, this time the mark is a French-Algerian arms dealer who may or may not be under the protection of the CIA (or \\"Christians in Action\\"), but is definitely the target of another assassin.  In no time, Rain is up to his old tricks of intense surveillance, watching his own back, and hand-to-hand combat, all described with Eisler's trademark rat-a-tat style.   <br /> <br />The body count in \\"Rain Storm\\" is a bit higher than in the earlier books, as several Arabic operatives appear to be after Rain . . . but for unknown reasons.  And Rain also runs into Delilah, a gorgeous blonde who is on the target's arm but not on the target's side.  And Rain is also reintroduced to his past, as former comrade-in-arms Dox arrives with the dubious promise of CIA riches aswell as the threat of a classic CIA doublecross.   <br /> <br />For fans of the earlier novels, it's a bit sad that the beloved Japanese cop Tatsu is left on the sidelines for the most part, and that Rain does not sink deeper into the corrupt scene of the Japanese government.  But these pangs are easily overcome by the delights of watching Rain maneuver in his new environment against a completely new set of foes.   <br /> <br />So put on your favorite jazz CD, pour yourself a healthy single malt, and dive in for another session with John Rain, the master assassin!	2004-12-30

Japanese-American assassin John Rain is still \\"at work\\" in Japan, carrying out assassinations with his rare talent for creating the appearance of death by accidental causes.   <br /> <br />But Rain's life is precarious.  Despite his earnest work at remaining anonymous in one of the world's most crowded areas, Rain has forged some connections with real people . . . connections that may get Rain (or the connections!) killed.  First there is Tatsu, the crusading cop who's sole purpose is to bring down Yamaoto, the man pulling all the strings in the corrupt Japanese political culture.  Yamaoto, burned by Rain in \\"Rain Fall,\\" is another connection - Rain knows that Yamaoto is out for revenge.  Another connection is Harry, computer hacker extraordinaire and Rain's some-time apprentice.  And of course, there is the beautiful jazz musician Midori, who believes that the reports of Rain's demise in \\"Rain Fall\\" have been greatly exaggerated. <br /> <br />Working with Tatsu, Rain learns that another assassin has adopted a cruder version of Rain's modus operandi - he creates the appearance of an \\"accidental\\" death by throwing people off tall buildings to create the appearance of a suicide.  And Rain soon learns that this assassin is the kind of guy even Rain has to worry about -- he rose to notoriety in the underworld fight clubs taking on men and fighting dogs with his bare hands.   <br /> <br />Delving deeper and deeper into the corrupt Japanese political scene, Rain gets several opportunities to practice his unique craft, and Eisler writes action scenes with an economic clarity that is very compelling.  Equally thrilling are his descriptions of Tokyo (and a good single-malt) -- Eisler is definitely emerging as a writer of noteworthy style as well as one who can create an interesting character.   <br /> <br />Not for the squeamish (there's a pretty high body count here), \\"Hard Rain\\" is an excellent follow-up to the audacious \\"Rain Fall,\\" and John Rain continues to be an anti-hero worth your time.

Lian Hearn's \\"Tales of the Otori\\" series comes to its (apparent) conclusion in book three, \\"Brilliance of the Moon.\\"  Like the first two novels, \\"Moon\\" further explores the mystical, magical alternate Japan that Hearn populates with fascinating, often terrifying characters. <br /> <br />In the second book, \\"Grass for his Pillow,\\" young Takeo married his soul-mate, Kaede, in a frantic ceremony that was not sanctioned by any of the appropriate authorities.  While it's all well and good for young Americans to elope, in the Three Countries Takeo and Kaede have angered just about everyone who is in a position to do them harm.  As a result, the drumbeats of war beat out a frantic tempo in \\"Moon,\\" as Takeo is destined to fight five battles -- four to win and one to lose -- as he fulfills his destiny of bringing peace to the war-torn Three Countries.   <br /> <br />Takeo -- who brings together the lineage of the Tribe (the clan of secretive, magical ninjas), the disputed inheritance of the Otori mantle (the Otoris being a proud samurai clan), and the upbringing of the Hidden (a peaceful, persecuted stand-in for Christians) -- cannot seem to make anyone happy, even though all he wants is to bring peace to the land.  His warriors mock him because he consorts with the Hidden, who consist largely of untouchable outcasts.  His Otori clansmen resent him for his inheritance.  Other warlords hate him for his marriage to Kaede, the beautiful heiress to a wealthy fiefdom.  The Tribe hates him with a murderous passion for abandoning their way, which commands obedience above all else. <br /> <br />And to top it off, his fate appears to involve his death . . . at the hands of his own son. <br /> <br />Hearn brings all these various plot lines together with a skill and economy that is breathtaking.  Indeed, Hearn undercuts many of the reader's expectations with sudden earthquakes, assassinations, and the like.  While \\"Moon\\" resolves many of the outstanding plot lines, it often does so insuch quick-yet-dramatic fashion that the reader is left a bit shocked . . . and, to be honest, looking for more. <br /> <br />The sudden conclusion to the book, as well as an enigmatic epilogue, strongly hint at further books in the series, perhaps as the \\"next generation\\" of Otori rise to prominence.  One can only hope. Hearn has created an alternate universe of such beauty, drama, and intensity that I feel as if I have left it much too early.  More!  More!  More!	2004-12-22

Daniel Silva's \\"The Kill Artist\\" in many respects is a by-the-numbers thriller.  A world-class Palestianian assassin has undertaken a daring plot to bring down the Middle East Peace Process. A lethal Israeli assassin is called out of retirement to pursue the Palestinian assassin, who destroyed his family.   <br /> <br />For many fans of the genre, this plot description would be enough, and Silva has mastered the trade of writing this kind of classic airplane fiction (you know, the kind that you need to distract you from the glories of flying coach class from Seattle to Atlanta).   <br /> <br />But fortunately, Silva has the patience and the talent to bring the reader deep within the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a conflict where wheels turn within wheels and the left hand isn't much aware of what its own fingers are doing, much less the right hand.  We also meet Gabriel Allon, one of the great tragic heroes of the genre, who bears more burdens than your average assassin and does so with a quiet dignity that is quite moving. <br /> <br />For fans of the genre, you'll be happy to note that all the right tunes are played, and played well.  Plenty of action, a bevy of female characters straight out of a James Bond thriller -- beautiful, intelligent, and bearing deep secrets and even deeper emotions - and above all, a fine appreciation of the deep-rooted hatred that moves both sides.   <br /> <br />A must-read for the fan of the spy novel!	2004-12-20

Montgomery Burns, to Waylon Smithers after Burns' alma mater, Yale, loses a football game to Harvard. <br /> <br />All kidding aside, Michael Curtis Ford's re-imagining of King Mithridates is a well-researched, well-written novel that offers many intriguing theories and images on the long-ruling Pontic monarch.  From convincing descriptions of varied landscapes to fully realized characters to some horrifying battle scenes, Ford has done himself proud -- this is a very entertaining read in many respects. <br /> <br />The main stumbling block of \\"The Last King\\" is that the image of Mithridates -- a physical marvel with a visionary intellect and courage to boot -- may be accurate, but the Romans are simply given too little credit.  Some of this may be due to Ford's choice of narrator, Mithridates' [...]son Pharnaces, who has no love for Rome and adores dear old dad.  But things get a bit comical as Pharnaces describes Mithridates' genius and the various attributes of the Pontic army -- and the numerous shortcomings of the Romans -- and the Romans keep beating Mithridates! <br /> <br />Every victory for Mithridates is magnified, and every loss has an explanation.  It's like reading the sports page from the schoool paper where they write about their own team's defeat -- even though we lost, we're better than the team that beat us.  While I appreciate the effort to tell the losing side, here, it would have been better had Pharnaces been a little more objective in his narration -- it gets a bit comical after Roman victories get rationalized so often. <br /> <br />For fans of historical fiction, pick up this book -- it's a worthy read, particularly if you're a fan of the Roman world.  It is a bit of fun to read a description of Sulla as a maggot-ridden despot!   <br /> <br />All in all, a well-written yet slightly off-balance read, but definitely worth the time.	2004-12-15

And lucky for us, Eisler treats us to a travelogue of modern Tokyo as well as a logical how-to expose of the assassin's trade. <br /> <br />I led my description of Rain with his ancestry, and this was on purpose.  While Rain carries physical scars from his profession and his years in the Special Forces on the Vietnam-Cambodia border, his internal scars are far worse.  Many of these scars stem from his mixed parentage -- Rain is a man who is not at home in the States or in Japan, just as he is not at home on the battlefield or in civilian life, either. <br /> <br />Rain is a man of shadows, whose highest attribute in his chosen trade is his ability to kill a man (moral - no women, no kids) and have the medical examiner rule the death by natural causes.  This anonymity cuts both ways, as Rain learns, for even though his employers know virtually nothing about him, he also knows very little about his employers . . . or so he thinks. <br /> <br />A successful assignment leads Rain into a complex plot that exposes the links between the Japanese liberal government, the criminal element known as the yakuza, the American CIA, and a revolutionary Japanese leader who pulls the strings of those who pull strings.  Eisler builds this creepy plot with great skill, as the meaning of clues become clear and the dots are connected, we feel as trapped as Rain does by the shifting sands of his reality. <br /> <br />Eisler also loves Tokyo, and his love for the city comes through in his various descriptions of the thriving metropolis, which almost becomes a character in the story. <br /> <br />The only thing that keeps this book from receiving a five-star review is a wee bit too much coincidence between some of the characters (mild spoiler alert).  What are the odds that Rain, an assassin with a penchant for whiskey and American jazz, will fall for his target's daughter, who just happens to be a beautiful jazz pianist with a healthy appreciation for whiskey?  And we also learn a little secret about her dead father that removes some of the blood from Rain's hands, which was unnecessary.   <br /> <br />But this is a minor quibble.  Rain is a wonderful character, full of awkward charm (he's no James Bond) and haunted by his past (including a mind-blowing \\"Apocalypse Now\\"-type experience in Vietnam).  Eisler has apparently continued this series with two more books -- I can't wait to pick them up!	2004-12-10

Raised among the Hidden, a pseudo-Christian sect devoted to one almighty god, adopted by the warrior-clan the Otori after his village was slaughtered, and a talented member of the mystical Tribe (a highly regimented clan of ninjas blessed with magical powers).  This is a lot for a young man to bear, particularly when the Three Countries (Hearn's alternate, mythical version of Japan) are devolving into civil war.   <br /> <br />Takeo was adopted by the charismatic Lord Shigeru, who met is end in dastardly fashion, and Takeo exacted revenge while falling in love with the beautiful-yet-cursed Kaede.  At the end of Book 1, Takeo and Kaede are forced to go their separate ways - Kaede to rule her newly-expanded homeland, and Takeo to study as one of the Tribe.  The catch is that its pretty clear that Takeo considers his oath to the Tribe to be a coerced deal with the Devil, and we're pretty convinced that Takeo's relationship with his magical kinsmen will not be warm. <br /> <br />\\"Pillow\\" confirms this.  Takeo undergoes rigorous training at the hands of the Tribe, and his talents continue to flourish.  But all is not well, and Takeo learns that his destiny with the Tribe is precarious, at best.  At the same time, he is learning more and more about himself and his connections both with the Hidden and with the Otori clan, and these bonds are growing too powerful to ignore.  Takeo also learns that there are mighty prophecies at work in the Three Countries, and he is destined to play a large part in their fulfillment, although there are some ominous signs that the fulfillment of the prophecies may not require his survival . . . <br /> <br />Through it all, Takeo pines for Kaede (even as he receives his education in the more intimate arts from another member of the Tribe).  Kaede aches equally for Takeo, but finds herself in a precarious position.  Her father has continually taken the wrong sides in the civil war, and he is a depressed shadow of his former self.  And her lands have fallen into decrepitude following war and neglect.  And she is making her way as a matriarch in a man's world.  And she is single, and customs demand that she be married.  But how can she marry another when she loves Takeo so fiercely?  How Kaede responds to these various challenges (and others) through her wit and courage is a wonder.   <br /> <br />Most of the action in \\"Pillow\\" takes place during an exceedingly harsh winter, and the characters are often cold, on the verge of freezing.  The harsh landscape underscores the harsh realities that beset the young lovers.   <br /> <br />Hearn describes this all with an economic-yet-poetic style, and has a gift for capturing the defining characteristics of a landscape, a palatial estate, or a humble cave.  While the action scenes may be lacking in \\"Pillow,\\" the drama is intense, and readers will see that Hearn is going to great lengths to set a climactic table for the final book in his trilogy.

His first novel, \\"Cloud of Sparrows,\\" introduced the reader to the saga of the Okumichi clan, focusing primarily on its young Prince Hal, Lord Genji, in the early days following the reopening of Japan to the West.   <br /> <br />Genji, a young lord whose attributes were unappreciated - thanks to his long campaign of deception - plays a critical role in the process of Japan's reawakening, in large part due to the Americans he meets.  One is Matthew Stark, who arrives in Japan under the guise of a missionary but with a sole purpose of exacting vengeance for some grisly murders back in the States.  The other is Emily Gibson, a beautiful American missionary who has fled to Japan to escape the horrible consequences of her beauty.  These three characters, along with a wonderful supporting cast, have dazzling adventures that make \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" a heck of a read. <br /> <br />What makes \\"Cloud\\" such an amazing novel was its ability to jump from present to past to future and yet tell a cohesive, enthralling tale.  Genji's clan, the Okumichi, is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to see the future, and in Japan, the future and the past are inter-related.  One of the most tantalizing aspects of \\"Cloud\\" was the sense the reader had that \\"Cloud\\" was only telling part of a much deeper story, and several aspects of \\"Cloud\\" did not make a lot of sense, even after a second reading. <br /> <br />This was by design.  \\"Autumn Bridge,\\" while officially a \\"sequel\\" to \\"Cloud of Sparrows,\\" is more of an elaboration of the earlier story, in which certain aspects of the past, the present, and the future of \\"Cloud\\" receive further treatment.  And the results are no less harrowing or heart-rending. <br /> <br />While the \\"present\\" of \\"Cloud\\" and \\"Bridge\\" is the second half of the 19th century, much of the second novel takes place in the 1300s, as a beautiful woman - some say witch - sets in motion the events that would play out over 500 years later.  Matsuoka's ability to interweave these various chronologies is astounding - while leaping from era to era and storyline to storyline, \\"Bridge\\" never deviates from its essential tale or its overall purpose, and one of the great delights of \\"Bridge\\" is to behold events that have been foretold . . . but that transpire in completely unexpected ways.   <br /> <br />The budding romance between Genji and Emily continues to grow, as the misgivings of both are overcome by their love and desire.  Matthew Stark, murderous hero from \\"Cloud,\\" must watch as his son Makoto learns about his real history.  The truth of the Mushindo Abbey continues to be revealed.  And through it all, Genji battles treachery and intrigue as he gets ever closer to the day of his own assassination, which he has foreseen with startling clarity and tantalizing ambiguity.   <br /> <br />More than a love story, more than a samurai-slashing-swords battle epic, \\"Bridge\\" builds on the amazing foundation set by \\"Cloud\\" to tell a riveting tale that is sure to keep readers up late at night, trying to eke out one more chapter before slumber.   Beloved characters meet their end while new characters arise, and several stories grow deeper and more moving as events unfold.  <br /> <br />Best of all, more than a few loose ends remain at the end of \\"Bridge,\\" so it looks like another novel in this amazing series could be on the way!   <br /> <br />For interested readers, you must read \\"Cloud\\" first - there is too much of a back story with these characters from \\"Cloud\\" that will be missed.    <br />	2004-12-06
US	51070201	R3BHF6NEPODNQ8	0312312911	40658310	The Winter Mantle	Books	4	19	23	N	N	Historical Fiction Meets Romance in 11th Century England	I picked up Elizabeth Chadwick's \\"The Winter Mantle\\" after reading a couple of Sharon Kay Penman's amazing novels of merry old England, in the hopes that Chadwick's works would essentially be more of the same, which would be high praise indeed.  <br /> <br />\\"Mantle\\" reads like a cross between a traditional work of historical fiction and a tawdry bodice-ripper.  While I am not a fan of the romance genre, Chadwick has such total command of the period that \\"The Winter Mantle\\" was quite enjoyable.   <br /> <br />\\"Mantle\\" opens in 1067 as William the Conqueror attempts to cement his hold over England following the Battle of Hastings.  The English nobles -- a wild Celtic bunch with massive arms and even more massive beards -- are chafing under William's rule, and William is not one to suffer disloyalty.  The theme of loyalty dominates the novel, although Chadwick focuses more on the loyalty of the heart than to the crown as she focuses on two generations of lovers.  <br /> <br />The ill-matched English earl Waltheof and Norman beauty Judith form the first couple, and one cannot help but take Waltheof's side against his shrewish wife.  Waltheof is a great big bear of a man, who wears the winter mantle of the title - a massive polar bear skin unique in all the lands.  A loveable lug of an earl, Waltheof's herculean strength is exceeded only by his kindness.  Judith, on the other hand, is the kind of repressed gal who cannot help becoming a wanton in the hands of her husband - and who resents him for it.  Her icy resentment builds until she lashes out at Waltheof one time too many, and the consequences are dire. <br /> <br />The second couple brings together the Norman courtier Simon, whose life was saved as a youth by Waltheof, and Waltheof's daughter, Matilda.  At first, Matilda seems to follow her father's carefree manner over her mother's rigid self-control.  But gradually, Matilda's once-regressive shrewish traits become much more pronounced, and her relationship withher husband adopts a hard edge. <br /> <br />Through it all, Chadwick spices things up with love scenes that leave very little to the imagination.  And while she does so with great skill, one grows weary of the bedroom scenes.  To be sure, Chadwick can write a battle scene very well, but these scenes are remarkably truncated when compared to the drawn-out exposition of wedding nights and romantic trysts.   <br /> <br />Where one cannot quibble with Chadwick is her ability to capture daily life in 11th century England.  Her descriptions are concise and vivid, and her characters are remarkably individualized -- even if the mothers and daughters share some glaring-yet-unattractive traits.   <br /> <br />And yet, at the end, when tragedy has been avoided and all is (relatively) right in the world, one feels that in the years following the Norman arrival in England there was a larger story to tell than the one Chadwick just told so well.   <br /> <br />While not a must-read for fans of historical fiction (but clearly not a waste of time, either), I imagine this novel would be a big hit for fans of torrid romances. <br /> <br />	2004-12-01
US	51070201	R3B4YBBFZC32M9	1573223328	608984993	Across the Nightingale Floor (Tales of the Otori, Book 1)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Promising Kick-Off Novel for Intriguing Series	\\"Across the Nightingale Floor\\" reads largely like historical fiction set in feudal Japan.  All the elements are seemingly present, from the samurai-ninja-peasant-monk caste system to the rigid codes of honor (including ritual suicide) to the fantastic art and architecture to the very land of the tale (the Three Countries sure look like Japan to me).   <br /> <br />But author Lian Hearn (pseudonym) has injected a slight bit of fantasy into the mix.  The narrator of about two-thirds of the book is young Takeo, an orphan and (at first) unwitting descendant of The Tribe, a mystical clan of ninjas who are blessed with various supernatural gifts, including invisibility, incredible hearing, and even the ability to split in two.  Young Takeo receives his education after coming across the massacre of his village by the evil Lord Iida, and is miraculously saved by Lord Otori, master swordsman and sworn enemy of Lord Iida. <br /> <br />Like many first novels in a series, much of \\"Across the Nightingale Floor\\" is spent on the \\"education of young Takeo.\\"  Not only must Takeo learn how to harness his magical gifts, he must come to grips with the fact that he is, despite his gentle nature, a born assassin.  His clan wishes to whisk him away to a lifetime of murder for hire, but Takeo wishes to serve his beloved savior, Lord Otori in his clash with Lord Iida.  Obviously, these two desires cannot mesh for the long-term -- but perhaps Takeo could stay with Otori long enough to bump off Iida . . .  ?  <br /> <br />The title comes from the protective floor that shields Lord Iida from assassination -- the floor is designed to chirp and squeal if anyone sets foot on it, and Iida will be alerted to the presence of the assassin.  Can Takeo's mysterious gifts allow him to overcome this fantastic obstacle and take the evil Lord Iida's head? <br /> <br />Desire clashing with reality is a recurring theme in this book, as forbidden love, the code of honor, and the power of a sworn oath all playstrong roles.  At many points, the melancholy of the characters becomes almost overwhelming, but this only serves to highlight their triumphs . . . although some of these are bittersweet. <br /> <br />Like most novels that revolve around the maturation of a young person, this novel proceeds slowly in places, so it is helpful to view it in the context of a larger series.  Assuming that Hearn kicks up the action a few notches in later installments, this should be one thrilling trilogy, becuase he has created several promising plot-lines that I look forward to pursuing.   <br /> <br />While not as epic as the works of James Clavell or as poetic (or as violent) as Takashi Matsuoka's \\"Cloud of Sparrows,\\" \\"Across the Nightingale Floor\\" is nevertheless an entertaining book and one to be enjoyed.  Check it out.	2004-11-23
US	51070201	R2RMCS2UPIJILO	0385336403	293114026	Cloud of Sparrows	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Cormac McCarthy Meets James Clavell!	\\"Cloud of Sparrows,\\" the first novel from Takashi Matsuoka, spins a complex yarn set in 1861 Japan -- this is a classic East Meets West tale, but it is told with brutal clarity and riveting poetry that sets it apart from more mundane works. <br /> <br />While Matsuoka's characters are initially bound by their rigid perceptions of each other (the Japanese see Westerners as uncivilized oafs while the Westerners see the Japanese as heathen wretches crying out for salvation), Matsuoka uses flashbacks and current crises to highlight the underlying similarities between the two cultures.  Both groups, Japanese and American, are capable of and commit acts of horrifying barbarity as well as acts of exquisite kindness.  Revenge and honor motivate both groups, as well -- the goals are merely pursued in different ways.  <br /> <br />The story focuses on the rise of Lord Genji, a Japanese Prince Hal character (who apparently served as his own Falstaff) who must overcome his playboy reputation and lead his clan to victory.  The victory he seeks is the conclusion of the Battle of Sekigahara, which was fought over 250 years ago.  Lord Genji, cursed and blessed with the gift of prophecy, knows that the balance of Japanese history will be determined by these Westerners, with their lethal machinery and perpetual focus on the future.  Japan, as Genji sees it, has cursed itself with its dedication to tradition, honor, and ritualism.  And so Genji seeks out the company of the new arrivals, three American missionaries who will each affect the history of Japan in their own way. <br /> <br />Two of the three Americans are characters for the ages.  Emily Gibson is a beautiful missionary who has fled to Japan hoping that the Japanese will see her as ugly, since her beauty has only caused her misery back in America.  The other American of note is Matthew Stark, who wears a missionary's habit but whose mission is murder.  Their fates grow entwined with Genji's as the wheels of fate and consequence turn inexorably. <br /> <br />Also riding shotgun with Genji is his deranged uncle, the mightiest swordsman in Japan since Musashi (and who is also cursed with prophecies of Japan's ultimate fate), and a beautiful geisha/ninja whose darkest secret is unknown even to her. <br /> <br />This is a Japan where men still slit their own throats after learning they have insulted the wrong man, where plots of vengeance grow over decades, and where men and women can still learn astounding new truths about each other and the world around them.  Through it all, Matsuoka writes with a brilliant clarity, which brings to life both his visions of beauty and his horrifying battle scenes -- scenes which rival the wonderful Cormac McCarthy in their stark realism. <br /> <br />This novel reads like the first novel in a series, as many loose ends are unresolved at the end.  \\"Autumn Bridge\\" is apparently the next book in the series, and I can't wait to check it out.  Dive in, and enjoy! <br />	2004-11-22

Rowling's saga of everyone's favorite orphaned wizard, Harry Potter, and does so in grand style.   <br /> <br />As Harry matures, the series continues to grow darker (and the books continue to grow longer!).  Harry is now 15, filled with raging hormones and a penchant for sulking, and he is also struggling with his identity as teenagers are wont to do.  For the first time, Harry begins to lash out at his trusty friends Ron and Hermione, his beloved godfather Sirius, and even his devoted patriarch Dumbledore.  <br /> <br />But who wouldn't be frustrated if you were in Harry Potter's shoes in this book?  Again, he's been forced to spend the summer wtih his miserable \\"family,\\" the Dursleys, while everyone he loves is off dealing with the rise of Lord Voldemort, who tried to kill Harry (again) in Book 4.  And nobody is telling Harry anything, so his natural feelings of exclusion are even more pronounced.  <br /> <br />And while Harry is beginning to be interested in girls, the object of his affection is Cho Chang, former girlfriend of Cedric Diggory, who died before Harry's eyes in the last book.  <br /> <br />And to top it all off, the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is denying that Voldemort has returned . . . even going so far as to appoint the toadlike Professor Umbridge as High Inquisitor of Hogwarts -- and this is a witch who seems to be making it her business to get both Harry and Dumbledore exiled from Hogwarts forever.   <br /> <br />Through it all, Harry's scar is perpetually flaring, a sure sign that Voldemort is up to no good, and Harry has recurring dreams of haunting clarity and ominous portent.   <br /> <br />For fans of Harry Potter, it goes without saying that this is a must-read.  J.K. Rowling is definitely spinning a darker tale here, but there is no shortage of her trademark humor and wit.  And we see some of our most beloved characters grow and mature -- from riseof the Weasley twins to legendary prankster status, to learning more about Harry's father and his comrades-in-arms Lupin and Sirius, to the delightful emergence of Neville Longbottom as a young man to be reckoned with . . . \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" contains delights galore and is sure to cause numerous readers to wake up with the reading light on and the book open on their chests as a sign that they tried to read \\"just one more page.\\"	2004-11-18
US	51070201	R12A1E11WYWC7U	0345396685	12198688	When Christ and His Saints Slept: A Novel	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Bringing an English Civil War to Life -- Awesome!	\\"When Christ and His Saints Slept\\" kicks off Sharon Kay Penman's treatment of the timeless tale of King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitane, and does so in grand style.  But this evocative title refers to the bloody civil war between King Stephen and his cousin Maude -- the vicious cauldron of strife from which Henry's reign emerged.   <br /> <br />One of England's most dynamic kings had the wheels of his monarchy set in motion through the deadly sinking of the White Ship, which claimed the only legitimate son of King Henry I, along with dozens of other nobles.  And even though Henry I had sired dozens of bastards, he insisted that the crown go to a member of his legitimate bloodline, and so he demanded that fealty be sworn to his daughter, Maude.  As one can imagine, naming a queen in the twelfth century shocked more than a few sexist sensibilities, and haughty, tempermental Maude was not the kind of woman to naturally command the love of her subjects. <br /> <br />Her cousin Stephen, a charismatic, thoughtful, romantic figure, decided to seize the throne and was actually crowned King with the sanction of the church.  Maude and her supporters could not accept this usurpation, and soon England was wracked with a civil war, all Britain was convinced that Christ and his saints must be sleeping. <br /> <br />Penman brings this complex tale of courtroom intrigue and battlefield exploits to life in a highly detailed book that brings the reader into the harsh daily life of twelfth century Britain.  This is a world where more women die in childbirth than men die on the battlefield, where it was common for children to die before age 3, and where meals of stewed lampreys could bring down the royal succession.  But this harsh world is populated by rich characters, filled with passion, humor, and ambition.   <br /> <br />Be advised that Penman's novels are more focused on relationships and dialogue than riveting battle scenes -- although she proves on more than one occasion thatshe is able to write battle scenes very well, her focus is elsewhere (in contrast to, say, Bernard Cornwell, whose \\"Grail Quest\\" trilogy may set the standard for medeival action pieces).  But this focus does not diminish the thrills of Penman's scenes . . . a testament to Penman's gift of giving her characters different-yet-intriguing voices. <br /> <br />Penman also tells several love stories, the most enjoyable of which is between the fictional Ranulf (Henry I's half-Welsh illegitimate son) and the blind Welsh beauty Rhiannon.  Ranulf's exploration and re-introduction to his Welsh homeland provides some of the most moving passages in this excellent book.  <br /> <br />A close second is the torrid romance between Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitane.   Henry II, Maude's eldest son, grows from precocious child to threat to Stephens' reign, and the mutual seduction between Eleanor and Henry is both charming and highly erotic.   <br /> <br />But while Henry and Eleanor command the last third of the book, the figures who influence its entire, vast scope are Stephen and Maude.  Both tragic figures in their own way -- Maude is the rightful queen, unforgiveably wronged by her cousin Stephen, but too proud and too impulsive to be a queen, while Stephen is the admirable man who has too many virtues to be an effective king -- their feud is truly one for the ages.   <br /> <br />This is the first novel in a series -- \\"Time and Chance\\" is its sequel (definitely read these in order!), and it appears that Penman is considering a third work to complete the saga of Henry and Eleanor.  When finished, this trilogy would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any historical fiction series you could name.  A must read!	2004-11-15
US	51070201	R2BYDBQGORR2ZG	0399147853	952360082	Time and Chance	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Epic Tale of Henry II, Eleanor, and Becket	\\"Time and Chance,\\" Sharon Kay Penman's sequel to \\"When Christ and His Saints Slept,\\" is a true epic, a masterpiece of historical fiction.  Spanning the years from 1156 to 1171, Penman places the reader in the courts, cathedrals, and villages of England and France during the early years of the reign of King Henry II, who through a combination of audacity, cunning, and relentless energy built an empire. <br /> <br />Even though Penman has unabashedly placed Henry II on a pedestal, she does not pretend that Henry lacked allies.  Foremost among them was his wife, Eleanor of Aquitane, who rises above the period's rampant sexism to become one of the most important players on the European stage through her own attributes, including beauty, daring, wit, and above all, a steely determination to achieve her ends.  Eleanor recognizes that she and Henry are an almost perfectly matched pair -- not for nothing does Eleanor exact revenge on her first husband, King Louis of France, who claimed she was barren, by having eight children with Henry! <br /> <br />There are several key storylines in this wonderful book, and Penman keeps them all in relative balance -- not an easy trick, since many of the \\"minor\\" players could easily be the subject of their own novels -- this just goes to show how astounding a man Henry was.  For one, even though Eleanor is the light of Henry's life for years, she must come to terms with Henry's ill-advised but torrid affair with the gorgeous waif, Rosamund Clifford.  How Eleanor copes with this betrayal -- through her combination of stark realism, fierce love for Henry, and her own colossal pride -- is a riveting tale. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way, there's also the story of Henry's titanic clash with the church!  On the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry appoints his right-hand-man, Thomas Becket, to the post. In this, Henry hopes to bring a sense of worldly realpolitik to the church, which has become a bloated, corrupt institution in Henry's mind.  Becket seems to be the ideal choice, sharing Henry's mind and loyal to a fault.  But upon taking the mantle, Becket begins to thwart Henry at every turn, and the clash between these two giants is one for the ages. <br /> <br />Through it all, Henry races around Britain and France, putting down rebellion after rebellion.  His ill-fated confrontations with Wales receive the most attention, and Penman describes in exquisite detail the horrors an English army undergoes as it invades that mysterious, shrouded land to the west.  Many of Penman's characters, including the completely-fictitious Ranulf, are Welsh (or, in Ranulf's case, half-English, half-Welsh), and Penman brings a humnanity to the Welsh that is rarely seen -- all too often, books are written from the English perspective where the Welsh are the \\"other,\\" and this is a refreshing change. <br /> <br />Penman focuses more on relationships and verbal confrontations than the battlefield, although there is plenty of blood and gore to be found.  But this is not a pell-mell action-packed book, but is rather more about the people who made this age such a pivotal one for England, and indeed, all of Europe.   <br /> <br />Penman writes with a sufficiently modern style so that all of her characters are accessible, but she throws sufficient linguistic touches into the dialogue so that her characters don't sound like folks you would hear at the local coffee shop.  For example, the use of \\"for certes\\" instead of the modern, \\"for certain,\\" and similar tidbits gives the book a nice historical flavor without making it too obtuse for modern readers.   <br /> <br />The reader is whisked away to a different age, and Penman makes the reader feel right at home with humanizing details -- from the use of stale bread, or \\"trenchers,\\" as dinner plates (with the remants given to the poor after a feast, to the Welsh love of poetry, to the seasickness resulting from a daring Channel crossing, the reader feels right at home in Penman's twelfth centruy.  And what an age it was! <br /> <br />Highly recommended for fans of historical fiction and Anglophiles! <br />	2004-11-05

In a flash, Martin believes he spies an unknown painting by the Dutch master Bruegel, currently being employed as a chimney-stop.  Soon Martin is engaged with himself in a furious battle of rationalization as he becomes consumed with the notion of swiping it from Churt's grubby hands and making millions off it, all without Churt's knowledge.  Which is difficult, because Churt is desperate for money and has a nose for treachery, being a treacherous sort himself. <br /> <br />What ensues is a hilarious tale of duplicity, half-truths, a stretched marriage (Kate, Martin's suffering wife, labors away unsuccessfully as Martin's conscience), pathetic overtures for infidelity, and a torrent of art criticism.  Through it all, Frayn writes exceedingly well, evoking just the right amounts of panic, triumph, guilt, shame, horror, and self-satisfaction to make Martin a loveable schmuck.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Martin offers a highly entertaining and insightful dissertation on iconography and Dutch history, and at the end of the day, \\"Headlong\\" conveys a lot of information along with smiles, chuckles, and outright guffaws.   <br /> <br />\\"Headlong\\" is the perfect title for this work, and you will enjoy turning the pages as Martin dives headlong into this crazy world of art and the double-cross.   <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

In a scene the author describes with chilling clarity, a terrorist raid on a government office in Europe results in the cold-blooded execution -- on camera -- of a beautiful, innocent American woman.  And the terrorists appear to fly to safety behind the Iron Curtain (the book is set in the Reagan era) without so much as a scratch.  <br /> <br />Heller, the dead woman's fiance, just happens to be a top CIA cryptographer.  Far from a field agent, Heller's a nerd, content to be squirrelled away with his computer and completely consumed with the idea of proving who in fact wrote Shakespeare's plays.  Far from a field agent, his is the amateur of the title. <br /> <br />His life in ruins, Heller appears to be destined for a long slow decline into depression and alcoholism.  But, through his fiance's father, Heller learns of the restorative power of revenge.  Soon, Heller has blackmailed the CIA into letting him seek revenge, and he's getting trained as a field agent.  His plan is to go behind the Iron Curtain and kill the three terrorists who murdered his beloved fiance. <br /> <br />But, for unspecified, ominous reasons, the Powers-That-Be at the CIA don't seem too excited about Heller's plan, and their frustrations aren't just due to the fact that Heller has successfully blackmailed the Company.     <br /> <br />Thus far, \\"The Amateur\\" is a perfectly satisfactory thriller.  Refreshingly, the story relies more on the human element than high-tech gadgetry, so it's nice to see Heller relying on his own wits and courage.  Littell's writing is appropriately direct and concise -- he's not a Clancy-esque windbag getting sidetracked on matters of politics or superfluous subplots.  But after Heller gets into the field, the book spins a little out of control, which is surprising considering how controlled the first half was.   <br /> <br />Littell, I suppose, was in a bit of a quandarywith Heller.  After all, Heller is not a field agent and only receives a few weeks of assassination-related training.  So it wouldn't be logical for Heller to suddenly become the next James Bond.  But in allowing Heller to get from A to B to C, Littell allows Heller to benefit from a few too many coincidences.  Note -- if you're ever working with a CIA agent in the field, don't ever exchange items of clothing that might cause you to be mistaken for the agent through a rifle scope.  And if you're sidling up behind the field agent to put a bullet in his brain, don't give the agent time to be suddenly distracted so that he turns his head, causing you to miss. <br /> <br />It's also a little contrived that folks on the other side of the Iron Curtain with whom Heller gets involved are also fixated on the authorship of Shakespeare's plays.  Yes, it's an interesting field of study, but to have so many experts in that subject in one small novel (only 252 pages) just ain't plausible. <br /> <br />This is the first of Littell's books that I've read, and I'm surely going to look into his other works.  But I have to say that I was disappointed with certain aspects of this book -- not only did the book show great promise at the beginning, Littell's reputation had preceded him, so I had high expectations.	2004-10-22
US	51070201	R27YULDK3Y8XAT	0312203713	41199299	Suspension	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Detective Tale Tosses Reader Back to 1883	\\"Suspension,\\" the debut novel of Richard Crabbe, tells two riveting parallel stories -- one of revenge, and the other a powerfully-addictive detective story.  Both are set in the vividly described New York City, captivated by the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge.   <br /> <br />Crabbe takes the unusual step of opening his novel with a sensitive depiction of his main villain, Thaddeus Sangree, former officer in the Army of the Confederacy.  Sangree is haunted by the death at Gettysburg of his beloved, idealized brother, Franklin (and based on how Franklin died, nobody could blame Sangree for carrying a grudge).  This experience has instilled in Sangree a conviction that the Civil War hasn't really ended, and he must get revenge against the man he holds responsible for Franklin's death - Union Colonel Washington Roebling. <br /> <br />Roebling just happens to be the chief engineer and driving force behind the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, having taken over for his father after his death at the Bridge.  Crabbe masterfully captures how important the Brooklyn Bridge was as a symbol in 1883 -- a statement of the power of Industrial America (i.e., the Northern version of success, not the Southern), and a gesture of healing and bridging gaps to bring a nation together.  Roebling has invested so much of himself into the Bridge that he has been reduced to a shell of a man -- he spent so much time in the caissons (the underwater chambers where the foundations of the Bridge were built) that the \\"bends\\" -- which were unknown at the time -- prevent him from any strenuous work.  Rather than just kill Roebling, Sangree and his band of saboteurs want to bring down the Bridge itself.  What better revenge could former Confederates wreak on Roebling than to destroy his life's work? <br /> <br />Loose lips force Sangree and cohorts to kill bridge-worker Terrence Bucklin, and this brings NYC Detective Tom Braddock onto the scene.  Braddock, a detective's detective (i.e., he'll crackyour skull if that's what it takes to get your tale, but only as a last resort, and he'll sure feel bad about it), pursues Bucklin's murderers with a doggedness that is truly inspiring.  While there is plenty of action in \\"Suspension,\\" Crabbe shows the less-glamorous side of detective work, as well - perhaps as an author he relates to the adage that the detective's best asset is \\"an iron butt,\\" due to all the book-work that has to be done. <br /> <br />As Braddock gets closer to his marks, Crabbe brings New York City to life -- particularly the tenements -- through vivid descriptions and clever attention to detail.  Only an author steeped in New York City could offer such precise details as the varying odors emerging from various parts of the industrial city, and Crabbe also gives us a few street urchins for local color and humor.   <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed reading \\"Suspension\\" after reading David McCullough's magnificent history of the building of the Bridge -- one of America's great achievements.  This gave me the background to appreciate the aspects of the building that Crabbe was necessarily only able to hint at or make peripheral to the story -- the rampant corruption, the key role played by Washington Roebling's wife Emily in the building of the Bridge, and most importantly, the sheer weight the Bridge possessed in New York City life during the time.   <br /> <br />\\"Suspension\\" is one heck of a novel, and the fact that it is Crabbe's first is just plain amazing.	2004-10-18
US	51070201	R3GMKAEL4H362Y	0345370260	883689940	The Tokaido Road: A Novel of Feudal Japan	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Exquisitely Beautiful Road Trip to Revenge	\\"The Tokaido Road\\" is, at first glance, a road trip wrapped around a tale of revenge . . . and a beautiful one, at that.   <br /> <br />Lady Asano, nicknamed \\"Cat,\\" is a gorgeous, refined daughter of a samurai lord who was betrayed and forced to commit suicide.  We first meet Cat, who has been forced to work as a courtesan thanks to her family's disgrace, as she stares at a dead \\"client,\\" who died eating a poisoned dish meant for her.  Within moments, Cat uses her ingenuity to escape her brothel and begin her journey down the Tokaido Road, which shall end with her death -- either by her failure, or by her own hand after her success. <br /> <br />Along the way, Ms. St. Clair Robson throws the reader back into feudal Japan, untarnished by Western influence (although there is an entertaining scene where the Japanese vie to catch a glimpse of the \\"orangutans,\\" which were the red-headed Dutch traders who had very limited access to the Japanese mainland).  Robson does a masterful job of putting the reader inside the Asian mind, where poetry transcends all, and the mournful beauty of a landscape can be the transcendant moment of a lifetime. <br /> <br />Other writers would have been tempted to make \\"The Tokaido Road\\" into a chop-socky action piece.  To be sure, Cat is an expert with the Japanese sword/spear, the naginata, and we see her use it to lethal effect.  We also see the ronin, Hanshiro, swordsman extraordinaire, mete out lethal justice with \\"Barber.\\"  But it is a mark of Robson's appropriate restraint that Hanshiro's most powerful demonstration of swordsmanship is used to prevent a swordfight, rather than win one.   <br /> <br />Hanshiro is one heck of a character, by the way.  A masterless samurai, Hanshiro is charged by the holder of Cat's courtesan contract to track Cat down.  Initially convinced that this is just another hum-drum assignment, the noble Hanshiro eventually sees through the fog of Cat's various disguises and counterfeits to see the steel-strong will and razor-sharp mind behind the gorgeous facade, and he falls in love with Cat even before they have their first conversation.  As unbelievable as this poorly written review makes that plot line, Robson pulls it off masterfully, again by placing us so well inside the thoughts, values, and motivations of these characters. <br /> <br />We also get to meet Kasane, the peasant girl who latches on to Cat with a zeal that is at first annoying, but soon is cherished.  Kasane's home-spun simplicity is charming, and her love-letter romance with the star-struck Traveler brings any number of smiles. <br /> <br />Structured around the journey along the Tokaido Road, the major highway in Japan, the book undeniably has an episodic feel, as minor characters make brief appearances and depart, but most leave quite an impression.  <br /> <br />Robson also shows the harsh world of feudal Japan, where peasants and farmers live on a razor's edge between sustenance and starvation, and samurai are always struggling to maintain honor when disgrace is always lurking.  Robson is unflinching in her depiction of this long-lost Japan, and this unyielding focus creates moments of great sadness as well as great triumph.   <br /> <br />This story is a parallel story to the famed \\"47 Ronin\\" story, in which forty-seven ronin plotted to avenge their betrayed lord, and, in one night, killed their lord's betrayer and then committed ritual suicide.  In \\"Tokaido Road,\\" Cat's father is the betrayed lord, and Cat's plot of vengeance runs parallel to that of the 47 ronin.  In perhaps the only weak point of the book, Cat is ultimately more of an observer to the act of vengeace rather than a participant.  After all this woman has been through, she deserved to take it herself. <br /> <br />But, as one of the wiser characters in the book says, courage means living when it's time to live and dying when it's time to die.  For Cat, the answer to that question denies her certain opportunities, but opens up others. <br /> <br />Cat is not a character to be forgotten, and \\"Tokaido Road\\" is a book that should be read.	2004-10-04
US	51070201	R3801LJXXF8E6X	1570719047	51342130	The Shadow of God: A Novel of War and Faith	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Moving Tale of Horrific Siege	Anthony Goodman's \\"The Shadow of God:  A Novel of War and Faith,\\" is a \\"new classic\\" of historical fiction that alternately charms and shocks the reader. <br /> <br />Essentially the tale of the Muslim siege of the Knights of St. John at Rhodes in 1520, the subtitle of the novel could be \\"A Novel of War, Love, and Faith.\\"  It is undeniably a novel about war -- Goodman writes in a straightforward, riveting style that calls to mind the best work of Bernard Cornwell (the Sharpe series, the Grail Quest series, etc.) without going over-the-top.  And the siege of Rhodes gave Goodman many opportunities for excess.  One of the longest sieges in history, disease, famine, and misery plagued both sides.  Further, the Knights' fortress in Rhodes was the best-defended site in the world, and the few hundred knights in the fortress easily had a kill ratio of over twenty to one as the Islamic forces marched endlessly into certain death.  Goodman captures the horrors of a war fought with cannon, broadsword, scimitar, musket, crossbow, and even subterranean mining and counter-mining with great effect. <br /> <br />Thankfully, Goodman also spends a great deal of time with the players on both sides, and we see the humans on both sides, including the Ottoman Sultan Sulieman, leader of the Islamic forces, and Phillipe, leader of the Knights.  Sulieman, a young sultan, is the \\"Shadow of God,\\" whose words have the power of life and death over his subjects.  Sulieman is willing to throw thousands of lives away to rid Rhodes of the Knights, and he is not above executing those he sees fit, but Sulieman always comes across as a vivid character, not a cardboard cutout villain that he could have been in a lesser book. <br /> <br />The same applies to Phillipe, who commands the Knights with an apparent fanaticism.  But Goodman allows us to see the human side of Phillipe's rigidity -- not only is Phillipe well-acquainted with the treachery of past Sultans and the slaughter of Christian forces following their surrender, Phillipe is also tortured by his oath of obedience.  As he agonizes over his decisions, Phillipe also lives with his heart in his throat for the safety of his beloved Helene who has risked everything to journey to France to be with him. <br /> <br />This love story elevates the novel, as does the other major love story, between the Knight Jean, the Rhodian beauty Melina, and their twin infant girls.  Goodman, who is so well-versed in writing of battles, also knows how to tell a romance.  That these romances occur on such a horrific stage, well, only makes them more moving. <br /> <br />A well-balanced novel that neither demonizes nor excuses the leaders and creates several characters for the ages, \\"The Shadow of God\\" is a highly recommended addition to the library of all fans of historical fiction.  And the author implies that he's got a sequel on his mind -- the conflict between East and West on the Island of Malta, where the Knights once again face their Islamic foes.  We can only hope that Goodman has another novel in store!	2004-09-15
US	51070201	R3T1KDKHBNETMW	0385336608	817652979	The Gates of Rome (Emperor, Book 1)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Interesting Take on Young Caesar & Brutus; A Bit Thin	Conn Iggulden's \\"Emperor:  The Gates of Rome,\\" is a good, light take on the formative years of Julius Caesar and his childhood friend (and ultimate nemesis) Marcus Brutus.  An attempt to shield the identity of these two lead characters fizzles after a few chapters . . . it's hard to preserve the secret when two of history's major players are involved!    Initially, \\"Gaius\\" and \\"Marcus\\" are two children, bullied by the stronger kids and desperate to prove the strength that they know lies within.  Soon, they get their chance as Gaius' father, who has virtually adopted the young Marcus, hires the notorious ex-gladiator Renius to train the boys.  Like many authors, Iggulden gives us \\"training\\" scenes that appear to be little more than abuse, but it's abuse handed out with a purpose and a heart of gold.      Eventually, through some personal triumphs and tragedies, Gaius and Marcus arrive in Rome, just in time to take part in the civil war between Rome's two leading generals, Marius and Sulla.  The book comes alive, to the extent it does, in this section -- Marcus is quickly consigned to the legions in Macedonia to fight barbarians, and while he has some daring exploits, his actions on the frontier are of little consequence in comparison to the role Gaius gets to play.  A relative of Marius, Gaius takes Marius' side in the civil war but seems to pay more attention to rolling in the sack than to the politics involved.     The civil war between Marius and Sulla receives only a sketchy treatment here . . . one of the great weaknesses of \\"Emperor: The Gates of Rome\\" is that is follows a majestic treatment of virtually the same issue (the rise of Julius Caesar and the fall of the Roman Republic) -- Colleen McCullouch's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series.  This is not to say that Iggulden's effort is poor -- but his work is thin compared to McCullough's exhaustively researched epic -- which is admittedly much longer and a more intense read.      Where McCullough uses two novels, \\"The First Man in Rome\\" and \\"The Grass Crown\\" to build Marius and Sulla and relate the horrors of the war fought between these allies-turned foes, Iggulden uses a few chapters.  It just can't compare.      Iggulden also reduces the import of his story (in Caesar, after all, he is writing about one of history's titanic characters, one whose life needs little embellishing) by creating a sidekick for Caesar who has mystical powers of foresight and healing.  This element of the magical does not fit with Caesar's rise to power or the fall of the Roman republic, and the general silliness of the idea undermines the story.    If you aren't that familiar with Caesar, this book is probably fine for a start.  However, the biography Iggulden recommends in the author's notes, Christian Meier's \\"Caesar,\\" is more riveting, and one cannot forget that Iggulden is walking in Colleen McCullouch's rather large footsteps, and he does not erase hers.	2004-09-07
US	51070201	R2RQLLCDOQWGF1	0380727145	475088872	BLOODY RED BARON            PB	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Worthy Sequel -- The Vampire Wars Continue!	\\"The Bloody Red Baron\\" is an excellent follow-up effort to Kim Newman's \\"Anno Dracula.\\"  In \\"Baron,\\" Newman updates his alternate universe of vampires rubbing shoulders (and more!) with warm humans by having Dracula lead the Axis powers in WWI.   <br /> <br />Once again, Newman takes the audacious step of having the famous and powerful become vampires (Winston Churchill is a prime example, although there seems to be less of this trick than in \\"Anno Dracula\\").  But the most notorious vampire is easily Manfred von Richtoffen, the Red Baron.  The ultimate hunter is cross-fed by several vampire \\"elders\\" to create the ultimate winged combatant . . . a winged vampire armed with powerful hand-machine guns.  Now, not only must the Allied pilots be wary of a violent death in a fireball or a screaming nose-dive to earth, they must be wary of being plucked from their pilot-seats and eaten alive!  The vision of the vampire-squadron taking off from a high tower, with strains of Wagner echoing from Dracula's Zeppelin-flagship, makes for a riveting read. <br /> <br />Newman brings a few characters along from \\"Anno Dracula,\\" including Charles Beauregard, aging agent of the Diogenes Club, and vampiress-journalist Kate Reed, but most of the storylines follow new characters.  Edwin, seeming heir apparent to Beauregard as Diogenes agent, becomes entwined with the hunt for the Red Baron after a horrifying air raid on the German fortress of Schloss Adler, and Edgar Allen Poe, turned vampire and propaganda-man for the Axis powers, struggles to come to terms with his new role in the world.   <br /> <br />Newman combines an eye for historical detail with the talent to write riveting scenes of carnage . . . setting the scene amongst the carnage and devastation of WWI is perfect for Newman's style.  This is one difficult book to put down! <br /> <br />Newman's tale is also one of transition.  Like the warm, the vampires must also come to terms with the violent transition to the 20th century,as technology poses new threats to vampires and warm alike (a chilling scene of an Allied elder vampire first vanquishing, then being vanquished by, Axis tanks exemplifies this theme).  Among the most moving scenes are the \\"educations\\" that young, romantic American troops receive on the front lines.   <br /> <br />Not for the squeamish, \\"Baron\\" offers thrills galore, and also throws out some good condemnation for the leaders of World War I on both sides . . . an excellent, though eccentric, take on leadership and the ability of some to throw lives away for the sake of their own ambition.   <br /> <br />To borrow a cliche, if you liked \\"Anno Dracula,\\" you'll love \\"The Bloody Red Baron.\\"	2004-08-30

A brief prologue informs the reader that this is a melancholy age of defeat, and the surviving general of one of Rome's last defeats is going to tell his story. <br /> <br />From there, Maximus, Roman General, tells the tale of how he built the 20th Legion from nothing into one of Rome's finest legions, but was still unable to stop the Germanic Barbarians from crossing the Rhine.  Rome is ripe to fall, corruption is rampant, and intrigues are everywhere -- rival Emperors are only too quick to proclaim themselves supreme.   <br /> <br />Maximus, however, is a throw-back to the true Roman spirit, and proves that the guy who most deserves to be Emperor is the last guy who would accept the title.  Sent to guard the Wall in Britain and to put down a rebellion (led by his childhood friend Julian, who murdered Maximus' father and is sentenced by Maximus to death in the gladiatorial arena), Maximus gains a reputation for being a hard man.  His steely character is not enough to prevent Julian, who survived the arena and won his freedom only to unite the tribes of Britain and overwhelm the British legions. <br /> <br />Reeling from this defeat, Maximus is next assigned to guard the Rhine frontier . . . one legion against two hundred thousand united Barbarians.  In addition to these hopeless odds, Maximus must also fight against a corrupt bureacracy that refuses all but the smallest request for aid and also against a Christian church that despises Maximus' pagan beliefs.  Still, through it all, Maximus and his officers soldier on.   <br /> <br />All too soon, the Barbarians are at the Rhine and desperate to cross.  Maximus uses all his soldierly craft as well as some quite cunning maneuvers, but despite all his planning, Maximus realizes that his doom is foretold -- he will lose the Rhine.  Before that happens, though, both his friends and enemies will offer him the chance to become Emperor -- the oneprize he does not want.   <br /> <br />Through it all, Breem writes with a direct, soldier's prose.  Despite the clarity of his writing, though, there is a definite poetry to Breem's writing, and there are many passages to be savored.  The battle scenes are also described with a soldier's eye for detail, and tactics are easily grasped by the reader.  Breem also crams in a lot of historical detail (the glossary is much appreciated), but less than other novels of the Roman era (see Colleen McCullouch's \\"Masters of Rome\\" series for an example of a more detailed masterpiece).   <br /> <br />Maximus, whose heart is quite tender despite his steely resolve, repeatedly notes the human cost of this doomed conflict -- his recollection of a solitary barbarian charging the Roman lines to avenge his dead wife and children is particularly moving.  Maximus watches his forces dwindle, thanks both to the Barbarians and the horrific German winter, with a resolute poignancy that is unique, and even Maximus realizes that he continues to learn about humanity as his fate marches ever closer. <br /> <br />This book is a must-read for fans of historical fiction as well as for any student of Rome.  Most historical fiction about Rome seems to revolve around Julius Caesar and the early Empire . . . the juicy tidbits of those times are just too good to pass up, I suppose.  \\"Eagle in the Snow\\" has a different focus and tells the somber tale of the fall of Rome, and a mighty tale it is, too.  <br /> <br />A must-read if there ever was one!	2004-08-23

In \\"The Archer's Tale,\\" Thomas's father was butchered by Thomas's cousin, Guy Vexille, and Thomas's woman, Eleanor, was also murdered by Guy in \\"Vagabond.\\"  Thomas has survived several vicious battles and an even more vicious round of torture at the hands of a Dominican priest.  And through it all, Thomas has sought the holiest of holy relics, the Grail . . . although Thomas has not always pursued his quest with vigor.  <br /> <br />Now, in \\"Heretic,\\" Thomas at last closes in on the object of his quest by returning to his ancestral home of Astarac.  By pursuing the Grail here, Thomas also hopes to draw out his cousin so Thomas can avenge his father and Eleanor.   <br /> <br />Cornwell, as usual, keeps Thomas the Archer occupied, wielding a new, mightier bow with the same lethal efficiency.  For those who have not yet read this series, the archer was not the little guy standing in the rear picking off foes with little pinpricks. The archer was king of the battlefield, using a variety of arrows to slaughter men and horses, perforating even the strongest armor with cannon-like shots.  The arrival of primitive cannon technology in this series does not alter the balance of power. <br /> <br />Thomas, being Thomas, gets sidetracked with romance by falling in love with a beautiful woman (who always seem to turn up for Thomas . . . oh, well -- it pays not to overthink such things).  This woman was falsely accused of being a heretic and has been tortured at the hands of an evil priest, much like Thomas.  For his chivalry, Thomas is excommunicated.  Cast out, he nevertheless pursues his twin goals of revenge and salvation.  <br /> <br />Cornwell vividly describes the world of the Hundred Years War. Not only does Thomas have to contend with dastardly kin and mighty men-at-arms, the Black Death is screaming across the land, with horrifying results.  Cornwell describes it all with his usual straightforward yet captivating style. <br /> <br />\\"Heretic\\" is not a great departure from the earlier two novels in the series.  Sharp-eyed readers will have spotted clues in earlier books regarding the Grail and its location, but the mystery is still captivating, and the conclusion is unexpected.   <br /> <br />While not exactly a \\"feel good\\" book, the Grail Quest series is a fun read, and a rollicking ride across the battlefields of Britain and France.

In \\"Last of the Amazons,\\" Pressfield uses another wise-yet-sorrow-filled narrator, Bones, to tell his tale. <br /> <br />In \\"Amazons,\\" Pressfield leaves behind \\"classical\\" (i.e., 5th-century B.C.) Greece and visits the land of Greek myth.  Theseus, King of Athens, is known to many as the guy who slew the minotaur, but not much else is commonly known about him.  Pressfield uses the freedom created by the mists of time to flesh out a Theseus that suits his purposes -- not only is Theseus a mighty military man, he is a leader ahead of his time.  In fact, Theseus even believes in a primitive version of democracy, which may be a bit historically inaccurate, but makes Theseus a worthy monarch to the reader's modern eyes. <br /> <br />Theseus and the Athenians are not the focus of the story, of course.  Rather, the Amazons, those fabled warrior princesses, captive the reader.  Pressfield has filled in many of the gaps left by the mythology of the Amazons, and the Amazons emerge as a vibrant, fully realized culture.  Harsh in judgment, merciless in battle, and fully committed to the strict code of their society, the Amazons are a wonder, and Pressfield provides a compelling, vivid description of their culture. <br /> <br />Of course, much of the Amazons' culture revolves around might in battle.  No man can stand against the Amazons in fair combat . . . well, except Hercules, whom we learn visited the Amazons prior to Theseus and single-handedly butchered their mightiest warriors.  We see the terror of the Amazonian cavalry charge, and the savagery with which the Amazons pursued their battle lust.  Pressfield also shows the tender side of the Amazons, such as when an Amazon, without really trying or thinking twice about it, does a one-arm chin-up to return a fallen hatchling to its nest.   <br /> <br />The Amazonian queen, Antiope, confused by the \\"civilization\\" personified by Theseus -- and her love for him -- and the undeniable barbarism of her fellow Amazons (Pressfield pulls few punches when depicting the Amazons at slaughter), eventually leaves the Amazons and returns with Theseus to Athens.  This leads to the seige of Athens by the Amazons.  While Theseus could hold his own against the Amazons (although he's no Hercules), the other Athenians are truly outmatched by the Amazons.  Reduced to crafty block-by-city-block warfare to neutralize the Amazons' mastery of open-field battle, the Athenians engage in a tooth-and-nail battle for survival.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, as in all of Pressfield's Greek novels, the fate of the Amazons is a foregone conclusion.  What drives Pressfield's works is the sad majesty of characters who know their fate and yet drive on, whether its the Spartans at Thermopylae, the Athenians in Sicily, or the Amazons.  A bit darker than the other novels, \\"Amazons\\" tells an epic tale of a lost civilization, and tells it well.	2004-08-10

Not only does the text offer some lucid and entertaining analysis of key moments in history, it offers an insight into the mind of one of the leading (and representative) thinkers of the British Empire.  <br />  <br /> The selection of fifteen military conflicts as &quot;decisive&quot; for the course of western civilizataion is a classicly British effort -- many educated &quot;elite&quot; Brits of the mid-19th century considered their empire the axle on which the remainder of the &quot;civilized&quot; world turned. Accordingly, Creasy selected fifteen battles that dicated the course of &quot;civilization&quot; as he saw it, which essentially was Western Europe. By his selection of battles, we learn about how he and other British thinkers viewed their world. <br />  <br /> One should always resist the temptation to indict period historians as myopic (or worse) because they view their world through the prism of their times. We view our history through our own prisms, and readers 50 years hence will probably consider us equally limited -- a disservice to our current writers. Creasy, while undoubtedly biased in favor of Occidental cultures over Oriental, nevertheless offers a relatively objective analysis of the events covered in his book. He also provides excellent support for his designation of these battles as &quot;decisive.&quot; <br />  <br /> All his analysis is expressed in that classic high-brow British style, where sentences are meant to be parsed over, savored, and appreciated as an expression of style as well as historical analysis.  <br />  <br /> An entertaining, educational read that has been an influential book for over a century . . . what's not to enjoy?	2004-08-06

Kim Newman's &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; has one of the most audacious plots imaginable -- let's assume that Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; was non-fiction, and that Dracula defeated his nemesis, Van Helsing. Then, let's assume that Dracula &quot;seduced&quot; Queen Victoria and is now the Prince Consort, effectively ruling Great Britain. Throw in Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Jekyll, John Merrick (the Elephant Man), Jack the Ripper, and even a brief reference to the Lone Ranger(!), and you've got one heck of an amazing world to spin a yarn. <br />  <br /> Newman's Victorian England is populated by vampires and &quot;warm&quot; humans, and there is little shame in being a vampire. But not every vampire becomes a &quot;lord of darkness&quot; -- Newman shows many vampires scraping by, selling themselves just like the &quot;warm&quot; cheap harlots of London's lower neighborhoods. <br />  <br /> In that murky world, Jack the Ripper is butchering vampire prostitutes, using vicious silver blades. Two kindred spirits, the &quot;warm&quot; adventurer Charles Beauregard and the ancient vampiress Genevieve, pursue Jack and seek to put a stop to his diabolical ends. Beauregard works at the behest of the mysterious cabal known as the Diogenes Club, a group dedicated to the removal of Dracula's power, while Genevieve chases Jack out of mercy, trying to save the vampire-girls Jack seems hell-bent on savaging.  <br />  <br /> Newman packs &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; with action, unlike other &quot;alternate vampire histories&quot; (granted, a limited genre) like Brian Stableford's &quot;Empire of Fear.&quot; Beauregard's prowess with a sword is easy to grasp, but Genevieve, an &quot;elder&quot; vampire even more ancient and powerful than Dracula, has powers far beyond the grasp of even other vampires. And even Genevieve meets a vampire that she cannot fend off for long, a Chinese horror sure to give more than a few readers nightmares. <br />  <br /> A detective story that takes place in a London ready to explode in civil war where the &quot;warm&quot; take on the vampires and the vampires fight among themselves, &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; is a lark. Packed with enough gore and gothic eroticism to satisfy the vampire afficionado, &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; rarely goes over the top and manages to stay fairly grounded. A terrifying climactic stand-off between Beauregard, Genevieve, and Dracula ends ominously - Dracula is still out there, and he's not going to take his lumps lying down. Here's looking forward to the next in the series!	2004-08-03

He takes what could be an exceedingly dull tale of draftsmen and construction contracts and tells a spell-binding narrative of heroism, pioneering vision, and hard-ball politics. &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is a book for the ages. <br />  <br /> McCullough reminds the reader that before the Space Race or the mania to build the world's fastest computer, Americans were fascinated by mammoth construction projects. A bridge was much more than a means to improve transportation -- it was a statement of man's ability to conquer obstacles through mastering scientific principles. Following the carnage and chaos of the Civil War, Americans craved the certainty of science and worshipped the men who could prove that science did, in fact, conquer all. <br />  <br /> John Roebling and his son, Civil War hero Washington, were two such men. &quot;Thinking outside the box&quot; is too limiting a cliche to apply to these two driven men. Pioneers in both construction and the cable-building fields, both men combined a spartan existence and a single-minded pursuit of their goals to push the Brooklyn Bridge forward despite overwhelming obstacles. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; tells a tale that is often bitter despite the glorious result. John Roebling dies a horrible death before he sees the completion of the bridge. Many of the workers in the 'caissons,' which were the underwater (and therefore highly pressurized) work chambers that allowed the men to sink the foundations to the required depths, experienced the terrors of a new phenomenon called the &quot;bends.&quot; Washington Roebling, perhaps due to too many hours spent personally supervising work in the caissons, was left a nervous wreck by the stress of overseeing construction and spent many years watching from his distant bedroom window, incapable of visiting the work site. <br/>  <br /> Thrown against this devotion to duty is the greed of so many in the New York political establishment . . . including the notorious Boss Tweed. Without going over the top, McCullough depicts the stranglehold a few individuals could exercise over the dynamic New York society. The craven efforts to win contracts and slander the Roeblings are infuriating and make the Roeblings' accomplishment that much more noteworthy.  <br />  <br /> Several passages are particularly moving. There's the guy who actually guesses what causes the bends but doesn't quite &quot;get it,&quot; so nobody involved in the bridge gets the benefit of his speculations. There's Washington Roebling nervously taking side trips to see if he can withstand the stress of making bridge-related public appearances. Then there's the &quot;little guy,&quot; leaving from a day's work in the caissons to drink away his meager day's salary. To say that these scenes capture the &quot;human drama&quot; involves is an understatement. <br />  <br /> Again, McCullough presents these stories alongside the complex engineering details of the bridge, which drives the story forward while informing the reader. While not a page-turner in the Dan Brown sense, &quot;The Great Bridge&quot; is nevertheless captivating because McCullough captures the essence of these real people so well. By the end, the reader feels like an honorary Roebling! <br />  <br /> Such a magnificent construction as the Brooklyn Bridge (it makes you smile when, decades after completion, the city commissions an engineering review of the bridge to determine how the bridge needs to be shored up and the conclusion is a sheepish, &quot;needs new paint&quot;) demands a magnificent historical treatment. McCullough has given us just that. <br />  <br /> For devotees of Ken Burns' amazing &quot;Civil War&quot; PBS series, you can easily hear McCullough narrating this book with his bourbon-smooth tenor -- it adds something special.  <br />  <br /> As anadditional aside, reading this book will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the Meg Ryan romantic comedy &quot;Kate and Leopold,&quot; which opens with an imagined scene where Washington Roebling presides over the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he calls &quot;the greatest erection on the planet!&quot; (Fortunately, watching &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is not required to enjoy the book on its own merits.) <br />  <br /> A must for any student of American history.	2004-08-03

Thanks to Pressfield, the thrilling tales of Alcibiades' exploits will be known to a much wider audience.  <br />  <br /> Alcibiades was the first man in Athens, earning both the adoration of the people and the hatred of other ambitious men. Pressfield captures the essence of Alcibiades' leadership ability -- his few flaws (such as a lisp) make him even more admirable -- and the essence of the hatred he generated among his fellow Athenians. This duality allows Alcibiades to convince Athens to pursue the doomed Sicilian expedition yet allows his foes to arrest him and deny him the right to lead the expedition.  <br />  <br /> Alcibiades had a mercenary streak a mile wide, and soon Alcibiades is leading the hated Spartans against his former countrymen. Proving he is no mere Benedict Arnold, Alcibiades seduces one of the Spartan queens, and soon he is fleeing for his life from Sparta and ends up in Persia, serving the monarch who wants nothing more than to erase the Greeks from the face of the earth. <br />  <br /> Pressfield vividly describes the topsy-turvy Greek world of the Athenian-Spartan conflict, capturing the horrifying details of battle (the harbor battle and the inland battle on Sicily are masterful) and political intrigues with great skill. The madness of war comes home with powerful blows. Pressfield also throws us into the prison-pits of Sicily, as the survivors of the expedition cling to life under the most horrible of circumstances.  <br />  <br /> While the driving force of the book, Alcibiades does not tell his own story . . . there are two narrators, including the man who ultimately assassinates Alcibiades after he has betrayed not only the Athenians but also the Spartans. The periodic loss of Alcibiades from the narrative is the only thing that keeps the book from gaining its fifth star . . . as riveting as the book is, it would have been more so had Alcibiades told the story himself. (Although, to be fair, Pressfield's decision to have Alcibiades' assassin tell the story gives it a poignancy not soon forgotten, as the assassin was a close friend of Alcibiades' for many years.) <br />  <br /> For fans of historical fiction, this book is a must-read. While not technically a sequal to Pressfield's &quot;Gates of Fire,&quot; that book takes place earlier in the fifth century and provides a valuable context for this book, and probably should be read first -- although by no means is that required.	2004-07-29

Thomas is educated but has a ne'er-do-well streak a mile wide, and his life's ambition is to be an archer. <br />  <br /> Living during the Hundred Years War, Thomas's devotion to archery is smart, since the archer rules the battlefield. Archers use mighty bows that smash arrows through shields and armor with horrible effect. Cornwell opens &quot;Vagabond&quot; with one of the archers' most notable historic triumphs, where an outmanned English force destroys a larger Scottish army at Neville's Cross near Durham. Nobody writes a better battle scene than Cornwell - his descriptions of violence are gripping, and he never loses sight of the logistics of a battle as well as its ebb and flow.  <br />  <br /> Some of these descriptions are most vivid when Thomas and Robbie, a Scotsman, terrorize the countryside, picking off an invading force piece by piece, using supersitition as well as lethal force to bring terror to their foes.  <br />  <br /> Thomas is doomed to spend much of &quot;Vagabond&quot; in the deepest despair. He loses friends and lovers -- life at during the Hundred Years War truly was precarious, and Cornwell does not spare characters merely because they are Thomas's friends. Cornwell's willingness to &quot;kill off&quot; characters, in addition to being realistic, keeps the reader on the edge of his seat because all characters are in peril at any given moment. Fortunes can turn on a dime. <br />  <br /> Thomas is also charged with tracking down the Holy Grail, using an arcane book drafted by his father. Thomas has no mania for the Grail, but others do. Not only are other members of Thomas's family after the Grail, so is the Inquisition. And Thomas has an unfortunate encounter with the Inquisition that is even more terrifying than Cornwell's vivid battle scenes. <br />  <br /> &quot;Vagabond&quot; sweeps the reader from the northern reaches of England to a battle on the English Channel and back to France and Brittany. Cornwell does not waste too much time on travelogue-exposition, but he provides enough detail that the reader is always grounded in the scene. <br />  <br /> Long on action, spiced with humor and romance, &quot;Vagabond&quot; tells a rip-roaring tale that commands that you tear through its 400 pages. A great read! <br />  <br /> In some series, the later books &quot;stand on their own&quot; and can be read out of sequence without missing anything. &quot;Vagabond&quot; is not one of them -- do not read &quot;Vagabond&quot; without reading &quot;The Archer's Tale&quot; first.	2004-07-26

Steven Pressfield combines exhaustive research and a talent for storytelling to spin a yarn about one of history's most famous acts of heroism. <br />  <br /> Today, you can still journey to the little mountain pass of Thermopylae (literally, the &quot;Gates of Fire&quot;) and see the monument to the 300 Spartan soldiers who held off an estimated 100,000 Persian soldiers for several days. The brief epitaph, still legible after all the centuries, &quot;Go tell the Spartans . . .&quot; is one of the most awesome historical artifacts left for us. <br />  <br /> Pressfield uses Xeo as his narrator for much of the story. Xeo has bee mortally wounded at Thermopylae and is being interrogated for the Persian monarch Xerxes, who wants to understand just who are these Spartans who fought and died so valiantly . . . when there was no hope of victory. Xeo explains the character of the Spartans to the Persians, and his description is both powerful and precise. <br />  <br /> Pressfield has worked a certain amount of magic in this book as he fleshes out his description of daily life in Sparta . . . the Spartans are depicted as fully human, with flaws, fears, and desires. Unfortunately, the historical record of the Spartans is scarce because (a) the Spartans did not prize art and architecture, so there is little archeological evidence of the Spartan culture, and (b) most of the extant history from the era was written by the Spartans' hated enemies, the Athenians.  <br />  <br /> Still, Pressfield creates a fully realized Sparta, and Xeo offers up a detailed examination of the harsh Spartan lifestyle. Particularly moving are Xeo's depictions of the Spartan women, noble ladies condemned to be married to full-time soldiers. <br />  <br /> But, of course, the highlights of Pressfield's book are the battle scenes. From the gruesome, harsh training scenes (the training session with the tree is particularly brutal) and an early Greek-versus-Greek battle, we see the Spartan juggernaut in full force. When the battle against the Persians commences, the Spartans leave behind mere mortals and rise to the status of demigods. Leading a force of united Greeks from other city-states, the Spartans are the elite of the elite. <br />  <br /> While history tells us that the Spartans will lose the battle to the last man, refusing to abandon their post even after all the other Greeks have given up the battle as hopeless, Pressfield still creates a powerful sense of suspense. He achieves this by creating vivid characters whose individual fates are uncertain (the reader finds himself hoping, &quot;Maybe Rooster makes it out alive? Perhaps?&quot;) and describing the ebb and flow of the battle in such precise detail that one gets caught up in the Spartan hopes that they can still win the darn thing. <br />  <br /> Not for the squeamish, &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; contains enough detail from the battle scenes so that the reader gets a sense of the horrors of war, but Pressfield does not wallow in the gore, either. Pressfield also has a strikingly elevated style that ennobles his characters . . . these are men who care about both the little things like a hot meal and a good night's rest but also care deeply about honor and the love of the woman left behind. <br />  <br /> All in all, a heck of a book!	2004-07-23

Real-life historical figures Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (poet), James Russell Lowell (poet), Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes (amateur poet), and J.T. Fields (publisher) form the Dante Club, whose goal is to help Longfellow publish the first American translation of Dante's Divine Comedy.  Not only is Harvard College trying to halt the publication of this &quot;trashy, foreign tripe,&quot; but a murderer is laying low some of Boston's elite in horrifying fashion . . . and the Dante Club realizes that the murders mirror the punishments Dante metes out in his &quot;Inferno.&quot;<br />But who could be committing these murders?  Who combines the scholar's knowledge of Dante and the brutal strength of arm and of will to mete out such barbaric punishment?  <br />Soon, the Club is pursuing leads across Boston like a 19th century version of the Hardy Boys.  Pearl throws in enough red herrings, dramatic revelations, and other twists and turns to keep the pages flipping quickly.  A scholarly writer, Pearl also steeps the reader in historical detail, including the highly polished language of the principals to the vivid descriptions of Boston's streets and citizens.<br />Pearl also explores the personalities involved, from Longfellow's tortured genius to Oliver Wendell Holmes contentious relationship with his son, the future Supreme Court Justice.  Pearl also creates a murderer who is awesome in brutality and also an object of some sympathy.  <br />Through it all flows the Club's appreciation for the genius of Dante.  Like most modern treatments, the focus is more on the Inferno than the other two books, the Purgatory and the Paradise, but Pearl makes this relatively narrow focus work.<br />An excellent debut novel, with more depth than your average page-turning thriller, &quot;The Dante Club&quot; shows that Pearl has a great deal of promise . . . his next work is eagerly anticipated!	2004-07-15

In &quot;The March of Folly,&quot; Barbara Tuchman attempts to analyze the whys and wherefores of government's apparent insistence on the pursuit of policy that is contrary to its self-interest.  From the loss of Troy through the acceptance of the Trojan Horse to the corruption of the Renaissance Popes leading to the Reformation to the British losing the American colonies to America's military involvement in Southeast Asia, Tuchman searches for the common thread behind these disasters.  <br />Tuchman, as ever, gets the highest marks for her command of historical detail and for her clear, incisive writing style.  &quot;March of Folly&quot; is a lean, mean 400+ pages, unencumbered by extraneous or irrelevant details.  But while dense, Tuchman is always highly readable, making her one of the most accessible of the great historians.  Unlike so many histories, this is a book that can be enjoyed and understood outside of a library. <br />The only problem with the book is that by analyzing four exemplary exercises in myopia, Tuchman comes across as sadly shaking her head, saying &quot;You should have known better.&quot;  This tsk-tsking is generally warranted -- just look at the results of each episode -- but the book would have been better had Tuchman done more to acknowledge the relative ease of connecting the dots from her late 20th century vantage point.<br />Slight notes of superiority notwithstanding, Tuchman's thesis is a noteworthy one -- why do governments pursue policies contrary to their self-interest in the face of such (in hindsight) obvious evidence to the contrary?  Pride is, unfortunately, all too often a leading cause.  While Tuchman's analysis is necessarily weakest when dealing with the fall of Troy due to lack of source material, Tuchman's analysis of the other episodes is down-right masterful.  (For a more detailed Tuchman analysis of the American Revolution, check out her &quot;First Salute,&quot; a wonderful book.)<br />While Tuchman provides a decent grounding in each episode, and definitely enough to understand her thesis, the reader would obviously benefit from reading up a little bit on each episode prior to working through &quot;March of Folly.&quot;	2004-07-07
US	51070201	R1POJYYQZVUE7J	0060197005	832267718	Stonehenge: 2000 B.C.--A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Riveting, Chilling, Somber Tale with Intriguing Premise	Bernard Cornwell's &quot;Stonehenge&quot; is an audacious yet sincere effort to bring a human element to one of the western world's most intriguing archeological finds.  The purpose and meaning behind England's odd collection of mighty stones is (in all likelihood) forever lost to us, but that doesn't stop Cornwell from telling a great fictionalized tale about how Stonehenge was built.<br />Cornwell uses a triumvirate of brothers, the warlike Lengar, the sorcerer Camaban, and the builder Saban, as the vehicle to tell his story.  Lengar chafes under the rule of his father, a &quot;good chief&quot; when Lengar believes a great chief is called for.  A little murder here, a little patricide there, and Lengar is running the tribe as his own private war party.  Camaban, a deformed outcast, emerges as even more tyrannical than Lengar, using his sorcerer's powers to chilling effect as he rises from sacrificial victim to command the tribe in his own way.  Saban, a rather passive figure, is gifted with an understanding of stone and is charged by his brothers to be the master temple builder.<br />But this is not a simple tale of building a huge temple.  Cornwell firmly grounds his story in the harsh world of England during the Bronze Age.  Warfare, human sacrifice, and harsh conditions afflict and torment the tribesmen, and the building of Stonehenge during such chaotic times becomes even more of an amazing feat.  Cornwell's early line, &quot;And the gods were screaming,&quot; is a perfect description of how tumultuous life in England was at the time.<br />But Cornwell also gives us fully realized characters who mature and evolve.  Saban has several loves in his life, but he is not fated to keep them for long, as cruel fate seems to dog his step.  Saban is also at the mercy of the powerful hold the gods and the spirits have over the tribesmen . . . and the gods are fickle.  <br />In addition to fleshed-out, human characters, Cornwell tells the story of the building of Stonehenge in great detail.  Far from springing forth fully realized, Stonehenge is the product of several revisions, false starts, and unsuccessful trials.  Using helpful drawings, Cornwell never loses his focus, and the reader is generally able to envision the slow growth of Stonehenge from idea to finished product.<br />Always living life on a precarious edge between achievement and ruin, Cornwell's characters evoke powerful emotions - at various times evoking anger, pity, sorrow, joy, and admiration.  The only emotion in short supply is humor . . . Cornwell's England is a harsh, dangerous place that does not allow much room for levity.<br />That does not make the story dull, by any means . . . rather, the gritty realism of the story only solidifies the importance of the idea of Stonehenge, which is built to bring an end to winter and to suffering.  When faced with the brutal world the tribesmen inhabit, the mania to build Stonehenge seems logical . . . almost.<br />A terrific read!	2004-07-06
US	51070201	R2BRZXLCI8NXPJ	0881847429	195225572	The Empire of Fear	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Intriguing Premise -- Middle Section Drags; no &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;	&quot;Empire of Fear&quot; defies the expectations created by the sub-title (&quot;An epic vampire novel&quot;) and its ominous cover art . . . the book seems to promise a titanic, action-packed battle between humans and vampires, but takes a decidedly different, yet interesting tack.<br />Brian Stableford's novel opens conventionally, even if operating under a wonderfully unique premise.  The world is ruled by vampires -- Attila the Hun and Charlamagne are both vampires who have conquered Western Europe, and their henchmen, including Richard Lionheart, Vlad the Impaler (no great shock, there), and even Pope Alexander are also vampires.  Africa is also conquered by vampires, although the Muslims have been resisting the vampiric hordes.  The novel's first chapter, set in London, shows the world in uneasy balance, with the vampire aristocracy ruling over a generally pacified yet often unruly human population.<br />That is, until scientist, mechanician, and handsomest man in England, Edmund Cordery, strikes a blow for humans in a devious, vicious manner.  His son, Noell, takes up the standard, but instead of leading a mighty army, Noell gets involved in a journey of scientific discovery into the causes of vampirism.  Using what may be the world's first microscope, Noell spends much of the book peering through its lenses and speculating on scientific theory.<br />Surprisingly, for a book that has vampires, pirates, seiges, and bizarre religious rites, the book is rather flat.  Stableford is clearly more interested in the ideas presented by vampirism than with writing a hair-raising Gothic horror novel or a gripping page-turner, and his writing cannot be said to &quot;crackle&quot; or &quot;leap from the page&quot; -- even his dueling scenes are written in an expository, rote prose.  Indeed, the largest section of the book is focused on Noell's time in Africa, where he and his comrades have journeyed to find the legendary birthplace of vampirism.  This section is rathertedious, if only because the characters are so exhausted, diseased, and despairing about their circumstances.  <br />Ultimately, the final section of the book is set in the modern age, and we meet one of the characters from earlier in the book.  Stableford concludes his novel with a very touching, very thoughtful scene involving a vampire and a crippled boy with an unusual link to one of Stableford's heroes.  <br />If you're looking for an eerie vampire thriller, pick up King's &quot;'Salem's Lot,&quot; or some other novel.  &quot;Empire of Fear&quot; is not your standard beach fare or for staying up late at night to get a good dose of the heeby-jeebies . . . it is a careful, well-researched work regarding the quest for knowledge and a rumination on mortality.	2004-06-24

The relic, the black lance used by St. George to slay the Dragon, is seized by the Harlequin, and the town razed. The Harlequin also kills his uncle, an old priest with a murky past.  Cornwell's description of the destruction and rape of Hookton is masterful in its economy and its clarity -- this book quickly establishes that it is not for the squeamish!  <br />Thomas, the archer, escapes the sack of Hookton through his mastery of the bow, which is the dominant military weapon of the era (the late 1300's).  Contrary to common perception, archers were not the small wimps who hung out in the rear while the mighty swordsmen and cavalry fought the battles.  An archer was fantastically strong owing to years of stringing their mighty bows, and Thomas is an archer's archer.  He vows revenge on the man who has brought destruction to Hookton.<br />Possessing more lives than a cat, Thomas journeys to France and plays a crucial role in the sack of a French village.  Earning the respect, love, or hatred of those whom he encounters (he inspires strong feelings, does our Thomas), Thomas uses his wits, his skill with a bow, a good head for warfare, and just plain blind luck to journey from battle to battle, from siege to siege.  <br />Cornwell brings the Middle Ages alive with his vivid descriptions of life in small villages as well as his depiction of the mighty French city of Caen.  We get a good sense of the world Thomas inhabits, from the critical role of religion to the importance of allegience to a lord to the harsh realities of losing a battle.Cornwell does not shy away from the consequences to the elderly, to women, and to children if their defenders lose to the foe, whose army is more likely to be made up of murderers and rapists than heirs of the Knights of the Round Table.  Life on the losing end was nasty, brutish, and inevitably short.  <br />Of course, life isn't much better for the men, who throw themselves into battles worthy of &quot;Braveheart&quot; in their horrors.  While he never gets heavy-handed, Cornwell shows the terrors of war, from the disembowelments, beheadings, boilings, and other gruesome deaths, to the terrible cost in horses and the thankless role of the mercenary.  <br />Through it all, Thomas pursues his oath of vengeance, although not with the singlemindedness that would make him boring.  Hounded from time to time by a friendly cleric and fatherly commander, Thomas often seeks the solace of a quiet life with an attractive woman (he meets more than a few) in the midst of the carnage of war, and it rarely works out.  <br />While not as titanic as Colleen McCullough's &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series or as detailed, &quot;The Archer's Tale&quot; is a riveting story set in a harsh era.  Short on intrigue, long on battles, &quot;The Archer's Tale&quot; is an entertaining read that seems much shorter than its 380-odd pages.	2004-06-07
US	51070201	R31N1995AY6YLM	0802140149	35815621	I, Lucifer: Finally, the Other Side of the Story	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Yes, Fallen Angels *Do* Have More Fun	Glen Duncan's \\"I, Lucifer,\\" is an entertaining, hip-hop-be-bop riff on the existence of Satan and his role in the universe.  Told in a witty, pell-mell screed that tears off down seemingly random tangents at a moment's notice and replete with parenthetical asides, \\"I, Lucifer\\" has moments of sheer brilliance.  <br />The plot is straightforward.  Lucifer, whose very existence is a daily nightmare of pain, is offered the opportunity to get back into Heaven - all he has to do is occupy the body of a lowly writer (Declan Gunn -- one of the book's less successful attempts at wit) for a month without committing any major sin that would anger God.  Lucifer, with no intention of returning to Heavan, thinks it would be a larf and accepts.  Soon he has used his minions to create a flush bank account, obtained residency at a swanky hotel, and engages in a full-blooded orgy of wine, women, drugs, and an apparent assault on Hollywood in the guise of writing the next great screenplay.<br />\\"I, Lucifer\\" is at its best when Lucifer drops some bombshells about the world as he sees it -- original sin, the concept of time, the truth about the Fall, etc.  Duncan has actually done his homework, and the text is solidly grounded in its subject, and he makes some sense out of the various paradoxes in the popular conception of Lucifer.  (Why, for example, would Lucifer want Jesus to sacrifice himself for our sins, thereby confirming and validating the Christian faith?  Wouldn't the archetype of evil have better strategies than that?)<br />\\"I, Lucifer\\" is also a lot of fun when it savages our modern world.  Elton John's attorneys probably considered a lawsuit after the savaging he receives from Lucifer's savage typewriter.  Here, Duncan's writing is at its most crisp and entertaining.<br />Lucifer also goes to great, entertaining lengths to describe the wonders that are the human senses.  The image of Satan \\"letting it all hang out\\" just to feel the breeze, thereby shocking the neighbors, isdelightful.  However, it is a bit inconsistent.  Satan is repeatedly agog at the wonders of the senses, and regales us with tales of sniffing such wondrous items as dog manure, but yet Satan does not have much to say about the wonders of cocaine (does he really, really need the stuff?) or the details of his repeated appointments with London's high-end escorts?  Considering the amount of snorting and wenching going on, Lucifer's reticence is a bit surprising.<br />There is a sub-plot about Lucifer writing the next great screenplay, a true perspective on the Fall from Grace, but this doesn't really make sense, since there is no way that Lucifer is going to pull this off in the 30-day time period he has, and after Lucifer has left Gunn's body, there is no way that Gunn is going to know the story in order to sell it.  This angle does allow for some good jokes at Hollywood's expense and we get to see the comeuppance of a rival of Gunn's, but it doesn't quite jibe.<br />Also, the book kind of goes off-kilter when Lucifer, unable to keep Gunn's tics from affecting his behavior, exchanges a tender moment with Penelope, Gunn's ex-girlfriend.  Even though it's interesting to see Lucifer experiencing a bit of a bout of conscience, the Lucifer of these scenes does not match the Lucifer of the rest of the story.<br />A bit of a stilted ending, with the arrival of Rafael, sends this tale out with a whimper more than a bang, but a clever and chilling postscript nearly saves the day.<br />If you are not familiar with first-person, stream-of-conscience writing, you may want to skim a few pages before buying the book.  Apparently not everyone likes this writing style.  Duncan pulls it off very well, and it's appropriate for the piece - is Lucifer the kind of guy who would allow anyone else to speak for him?	2004-06-01

But the story is populated by so many con artists, dissemblers, thieves, and out-right liars that I could not shake the notion that I was going to have the rug jerked out from under me at the end, and this kept me from becoming too invested in the evident storyline (knowing that it was going to change shortly). <br />&quot;Coffee Trader&quot; has several strong points.  Liss provides a clear, if not exactly exciting, picture of 17th century Amsterdam, and he really sinks his teeth into describing the complex life of the protagonist, Miguel Lienzo, as a Jew who has learned to lie by hiding his religion from the Inquisition and must also walk the delicate line of doing business with the Dutch (a must in Amsterdam) yet remaining within the bounds of his Jewish faith -- as laid down by the local ruling council, the Ma'amad.  While not up to the standards of other historical fiction (see Colleen McCullough's &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series), Liss does a very good job painting a picture of daily life in Amsterdam -- right down to the rampant odor of beer and herring.<br />Lienzo, a once successful trader, has lost his fortune as the sugar market collapsed.  One step ahead of bankruptcy, he is presented with an opportunity -- to restore his fortune by cornering the market on a strange new plant, coffee.  Liss has some fun with his characters' first encounters with coffee, as he knows his readers are likely well-acquainted with its powers.  <br />But soon intrigue is piling on intrigue.  Lienzo, living in his despicable brother's cellar, is secretly in love with his sister-in-law, Hannah (who is, unfortunately, one of the weaker characters in the story and Lienzo's infatuation really seems misplaced).  Lienzo is also running afoul his creditors, who are clamoring for payment, and he doesn't even have his ownfunds to pull off his coffee scheme.  And Lienzo, by failing to keep his pants on, has alienated one of the most powerful Jews in the Amsterdam community -- and who may be working to ensure Lienzo's downfall despite offers of reconciliation.  And there are even more intrigues . . . <br />Through it all, Liss scatters passages from the Factual and Revealing Memoirs of Alonzo Alferonda, an outcast Jew who has developed a reputation as one of Amsterdam's most feared usurers.  Moving in a parallel universe to Lienzo, Alferonda appears to be working behind the scenes to help Lienzo to repay an old debt.  But, like everything else in this story, Alferonda's motives and ultimate goals are unknown until the very end.  <br />Perhaps I am being unfair by criticizing the amount of subplots and intrigue, but the sheer weight of it all kept me from getting too engaged in the plot or the characters.  Usually, when this kind of topsy-turvy plot is involved, life and death are at stake.  Lienzo, however, is merely concerned with his ruin as a trader in Amsterdam -- Lienzo admits that he could find another trade, but it would not be so lucrative.  Lienzo's goal is to become a rich benefactor . . . not only to do the good works, but to gain the prestige associated with that status.  While this may be an honest representation of the goals of many traders at the time, it does not necessarily make for a gripping tale.<br />All in all, an entertaining read, but a light one.  I look forward to reading Liss's honored &quot;A Conspiracy of Paper,&quot; to see if that book had more heft.	2004-05-24

First in everything (money, influence, panache, daring, etc.), the Noble House has tied its future to the rise of Hong Kong, which is &quot;founded&quot; in the book's first chapter. <br />Struan, who has founded the Noble House with the vast fortune he built as an opium smuggler along the Chinese coast (many of the trading houses in &quot;Tai Pan&quot; owe their fortunes to opium smuggling, although they euphemistically refer to themselves as &quot;China Traders&quot;), has used his influence in Britain and with certain Chinese figures to take Hong Kong for the British crown as a toehold in China.  Guided by his near-mystical vision of the importance of China to the world's future (at this point, China is considered by many Europeans to be a profitless wasteland populated by &quot;heathens&quot;), Struan will fight and kill to defend Hong Kong.<br />Newly widowed, Struan is comforted by his Chinese lover, May-May, who is also one of Clavell's most wonderful characters.  Teetering on the verge of a stereotypical &quot;dragon lady,&quot; May-May is a woman of courage, cunning, refinement, humor, and great beauty.  Clavell lets May-May speak in both English (hilarious malaprops abound) and in Chinese so the reader gets a true picture of May-May's intelligence.  Prejudices being what they were, Struan is forced to keep May-May under wraps, as it were, although the legend of the Tai Pan's Chinese mistress abound.<br />In addition to the loss of his family, Struan must contend with Tyler Brock, his one-eyed nemesis and leader of the second most powerful trading house, Brock and Sons.  Brock and Struan have a deep-seeded hatred that is doomed to head for a reckoning.  Brock, constantly maneuvering to best the Noble House, has quite a few tricks up his sleeve, and he forces Struan to make a dangerous gamble with the future of the Noble House.<br />In the novel's most intriguing sub-plot, Struan can ensure his financial status only if he accepts four half-coins from his Chinese mentor, Jin-Qua.  Anyone who presents the other half-coin to the tai pan can have one favor granted -- no matter what it is.  A chilling bargain, and one that flows through Clavell's future novels (Noble House).  <br />Through it all, Clavell goes to great lengths to capture the clash of cultures on Hong Kong -- from the British, American, Chinese, and Eurasian perspectives.  The sheer scope of man's prejudice is staggering!  <br />As pervasive as the racial conflicts may be, ulterior motives also abound.  Virtually every character in the novel has a wide range of goals, ambitions, and plots they are trying to weave, and Clavell handles this vast plot with great skill.  <br />Struan, clearly the dominant character of the novel, does not quite reach superhero status, which shows proper restraint by Clavell. Struan is forced to cope with Culum, his resentful, conflicted, naive son, as well as his brother, Robb, and of course May-May.  Struan struggles mightily, but he demonstrates that even the Tai-Pan is all too human.  <br />All in all, a wonderful tale of the founding of one of the world's great cities, Hong Kong, and an expert treatment of the clash of cultures between East and West.  A must read!	2004-05-24

Their closest friend, Publius Rutilius Rufus, whose letters offer some of the most entertaining passages in the first two books, notes the growing rift between the two even at a pleasant dinner party.  This gap is a sad foreshadowing of the chasm that will soon develop between these two.<br />Neither Marius nor Sulla is equipped to be second best at anything, and even though they share many traits, these two are too different to remain friends for long.  Marius, even though he has suffered a stroke, remains convinced that he is the best general in Rome and is just insecure enough to need to prove it.  Sulla, chafing at Marius's position as the First Man in Rome, is desperate to prove his place and to restore the patrician class (which Marius has undermined with his New Man successes and radical ideas).<br />Tragedy ensues as Sulla loses his beloved son and Marius suffers an even more debilitating stroke -- although this does bring the young prodigy Julius Caesar to Marius's side as an aide.  Marius's insecurity becomes palpable when he grows resentful of the staggering potential demonstrated by Young Caesar.<br />Marcus Drusus, another hold-over from &quot;The First Man in Rome,&quot; gets caught up advocating for the Roman citizenship for all Italians . . . this sounds odd to folks who aren't familiar with Roman history, but &quot;Italy&quot; as we now understand itis a modern invention. By advocating the extension of citizenship to all Italians, Drusus creates a firestorm among the Roman political class (the Romans were a remarkably arrogant people, and looked down with disdain even on those Italians who fought side-by-side with them against the dreaded Germans).  This conflict drives much of the book, and its fall-out creates the military conflict that drives the book to its conclusion.<br />Both Marius and Sulla get involved in the Roman military campaign against the Italians, and Sulla manages to win the coveted Grass Crown, one of the highest awards in the Roman world.  But still, Sulla feels eclipsed by Marius, and soon these two giants are at war.  Sulla, violating centuries of precedent, leads his armies against Rome, and the bloody fall-out of Roman fighting Roman is almost too much to bear.<br />Through it all, McCullough writes with her usual straightforward brilliance.  Rather than dazzle the reader with literary flourishes, McCullough paints an exhilirating world through precise descriptions and vivid characterizations.  Her grasp of the scope of the Roman world is staggering, and her glossary and maps are invaluable. <br />Fortunately, McCullough pays as much attention to the female world of Rome as the male -- we get a fully realized Rome that reveals the political clout of the Roman woman even in a world that officially denied her so much power.  <br />All in all, a heck of a read.  However, this book really must be read after &quot;The First Man in Rome,&quot; or you'll miss too much of the back story.	2004-05-20

Quinn endeavors to tell a story rather than offer a definitive analysis.  This is the kind of history that is best savored in a comfortable armchair with your favorite beverage, not at a desk with a notepad.  <br />Certain passages sweep the reader away -- the majestic falls near Quebec, the horrific torture of a mighty Indian warrior, the crotchety character of the Acadians, and on and on . . . Quinn brings this murky period of American history to life in a unique fashion that can only serve to heighten the reader's interest in learning more.  <br />Like anyone who attempts to tell a gripping tale, Quinn abandons historical analysis in favor of grand storytelling.  This is a different type of history.  However, by bringing the era to life and giving the reader characters and events to care about, Quinn can do more to engender a deep desire to learn more about colonial America than dry, hyper-accurate historical treatments of the era that might provide more pure &quot;data&quot; than Quinn.  <br />Check this book out -- you'll be glad you did.	2004-05-19
US	51070201	R1IX3CEKC4UHB1	0380710811	272869729	The First Man in Rome	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Excellent Kick-Off of Titanic Series	Colleen McCullough's &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot; is a magnificent, towering portrait of the men (and, to a lesser extent, the women) who unknowingly bring about the destruction of the Roman Republic while trying to save it. <br />With an enchanting eye for detail (her description of the great lengths Romans will go to even while at war in order to protect the secret of a prized snail population is delightful), McCullouch breathes life into some of Rome's most famous and infamous characters.  Gaius Marius is a provincial military man, a &quot;hayseed with no Greek&quot; in the eyes of most patrician Romans, desperate to prove himself because he knows, with every fiber of his bull-like being, that he is the best man in Rome.  Protecting a dirty little secret that it has been foretold that Marius will be consul seven times -- an unprecedented feat, given that you had to wait ten years between terms in office -- and will become the Third Founder of Rome, Marius has the military brains and the vast fortune, but not the upbringing to rise to his destined station. <br />All that changes when the head of the impoverished-yet-impeccably noble Caesar clan, Julius (not *that* Julius - he comes later in the series) offers an alliance with Marius -- marriage for cash.  In one fell swoop, allied with the Caesars (descended directly from Venus herself), Marius is on the rise.<br />Also rising, from even greater depths, is the wolflike Lucius Cornelius Sulla.  Of almost as noble of birth as the Caesars, Sulla is even more destitute, forced to share his bed with women who love him desperately.  Too creepy to be called sinister, depraved but not quite evil, Sulla is only too willing to use poison to achieve what ends he may.  Sulla is one of McCullouch's great characters, and he far more complex than Marius.  <br />Eventually, Marius and Sulla go to war in Africa against Rome's rival, Jugurtha, and victories there lead to Marius' command of the Roman armies against the horrifying Germans who storm out of the distant north.  <br />More than a mere military history, although McCullouch has gift for describing the horrors of battle without too much gore, &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot; also throws the reader into the middle of Senate intrigue.  Led by Scaurus, the Princeps Senatus, the Roman patricians do not sit idly by as Marius rises to power.<br />Throwing even more heft into this novel is the powerful cast of female characters.  Roman society did not officially honor its women with votes, elected office, or titles, but it is clear to all and sundry that Roman women are players to be reckoned with, and this side of the story is what elevates McCullouch's efforts above and beyond so many other novels about Rome.  <br />One advantage McCullouch uses to her advantage in this, the first novel in her &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series, is that there are relatively limited surviving historical records of this time period.  We have much more extant history from later years.  McCullouch uses this freedom to flesh out her characters and her story as she will, and the result is wonderful.  A detailed glossary, maps, and even sketches of the main characters all provide the details necessary for this time period.  <br />A must for any fan of historical fiction or of the Roman world.	2004-05-19

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Classic Parody; A Bit Dated	Daring to mock one of the most beloved and popular series of all time, &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; fortunately rises to the occasion.  Flexing the sense of humor that would pilot &quot;National Lampoon&quot; into American pop culture, the authors leave nothing in Tolkein's masterpiece unmocked. <br />Are you a fan of Gandalf?  You'll cringe at the antics of Goodgulf, conjurer of long-winded dissertations and maker of surrender flags.  Or are you a fan of the hobbits?  Then relish in the description of Dildo's birthday party (chorus to the boggie eating song -- &quot;Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble/ Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble&quot;) and delight in Frito's eyeing of possible exits while Goodgulf explains the mysteries of the One Ring (&quot;Cease thy eyeing of possible exits,&quot; commands Goodgulf).  <br />Aragorn is reduced to Stomper, whose best weapon against the Dark Lord's wraiths is his hilarious inability to draw his sword.  Gimli and Legolas become Gimlet and Legolam, whose legendary pursuit of the Narcs (after the kidnapping of Moxie and Pepsi) can be measured in marches of at least two hundred yards at a time.  <br />The authors have made &quot;Bored&quot; mercifully brief, realizing that while Tolkein fans can savor a hundred pages or so of mockery, a comprehensive send-up of the entire trilogy would have been too much.  A book that can be read in an easy afternoon, &quot;Bored&quot; makes up for its brevity by cramming more jokes on a page than any book I can recall.  Even the jokes that rely on 70's-era pop culture are witty enough to be funny even if you don't exactly get the reference.  <br />If you're a fan of the trilogy, be prepared to laugh out loud at this spot-on spoof.  Slightly wicked, &quot;Bored&quot; is nevertheless light-hearted enough that you realize that the work is a labor of love for the authors rather than a savaging of Tolkein's majestic works.	2004-05-19

Set in the early days of the Republic of Texas, &quot;Borderland&quot; tells a complex story of love, heroism, mysticism, political intrigue, and the Texan version of Manifest Destiny.  <br />Its grand scope is well-suited to Shrake's grand characters.  We meet the grizzled Texas Ranger Matt Caldwell, famous for his courage under fire and his drinking ability, Doc Romulus Swift, a Renaissance Man if there ever was one, Doc's sister, Callusaja, a New York-educated woman who desires nothing more than to return to her Native American roots, and a cast of other characters.  Some are real historic figures (the bellicose general Sam Houston, who unfortunately disappears from the action early on), and others are figments of Shrake's vivid imagination (Henry Longfellow, a sinister maniac stalking the West like a demented scarecrow).  Virtually all are characters you can sink your teeth into -- you'll never forget Herr Gruber, the burly German with an ax-blade permanently stuck in his skull!<br />With remarkable sensitivity, Shrake also portrays the struggles and triumphs of several women in the young Republic.  In addition to the beautiful Callusaja, Hannah Dahlman arrives in Texas from Germany betrothed to Matt Caldwell and finds herself in a romantic world beyond her imagining.  And Dora Kerr, who has left the theater of New York City to experience the real excitement of the frontier, is a woman of daring and spice who could have been the focus of her own novel. <br />Shrake does not merely focus on the Texans.  One of the book's true accomplishments is the humanity Shrake brings to the Comanches and Cherokees in his story.  Shunning the safe fall-back position of showing the greedy Texans swiping land from noble Native Americans, Shrake gives us a cast of Cherokee and Comanche characters who are fully realized, given over to love, cruelty, honor, wisdom, and foolishness just as the Texans are.  <br />In breathing life into both sides of the Texan-Native American conflict, Shrake gives us a world as fully realized as any in a &quot;clash-of-cultures&quot; story since James Clavell wrote &quot;Shogun.&quot;  That Shrake does not give as thorough a treatment to the third major force in the story, the Mexicans, is an indication that Shrake kept a tight control on the scope of the novel -- had he thrown many more storylines in, &quot;Borderland&quot; could have easily spun out of control.<br />As it is, Shrake's plot brings a certain element of myth into the story of the evolution of the Republic of Texas.  Doc Swift has journeyed to Texas in large part due to the mysterious calling of a man-ape who stalks the Texas Hill Country and lives in caves filled with gold.  The Dark Man, the Comanche who survived a lightning strike in his younger years, is given over to prophecy.  Caldwell, known as &quot;Old Paint,&quot; rides the crest of his own legend as an Indian fighter, Ranger, and veteran of the war against Santa Anna.  And Sam Houston occupies his world like Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill rolled into one.  <br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this novel five stars is that the ending feels a bit truncated.  Perhaps limited by actual historic events, Shrake does not give us the truly cataclysmic ending that his novel's scope demands.  The villain deserves a greater comeuppance, and the conflict between Caldwell and Swift is resolved a bit too neatly.  <br />Still, this is a minor gripe -- this is a heck of a book!	2004-05-17
US	51070201	R3LZVZMF3CPCER	0688053394	336392187	The House of Medici: Its Rise and Fall	Books	4	67	67	N	N	Good, Focused History	Christopher Hibbert's &quot;The House of Medici&quot; is an excellent history of the Medici family, but only as far as it goes.  For many readers who aren't as familiar with the details of the Renaissance or of Florence, the tight focus of the book will lead to numerous questions and open issues.  <br />Focusing primarily on the personalities who built the House of Medici into the juggernaut it became (particularly Cosimo and Lorenzo the Magnificent), Hibbert unquestionably brings certain aspects of the period to life.  In particular, one gets an appreciation for the delicate balancing act Cosimo managed to pull off -- at times ruthless, yet willing to share power and refrain from putting himself too far forward in the perpetual contest among the leading families.  This trait was lacking in the firebrand Lorenzo, whose refusal to at least allow the other noble families the appearance of being major players generated the massive resentment that culminated in the assassination attempt that wounded Lorenzo and killed his beloved brother.  <br />At the apex of their power and influence, the Medici were the prime movers and shakers of the age.  While describing Cosimo and Lorenzo, the pillars of the family, Hibbert's tale is almost inspirational.  When describing the lesser lights that through sheer accident of birth came to rule this mighty house (and guided its decline), &quot;House of Medici&quot; becomes less inspiring but no less entertaining -- several of Hibbert's descriptions of the nincompoops are hilarious.<br />Again, the book would have benefited from providing a bit more analysis beyond the personalities of the Medici family.  When contrasted to the extreme contextual details provided by Lauro Martines in &quot;April Blood,&quot; his work about the plot to kill Lorenzo, the weaknesses of Hibbert's narrow focus come through.  <br />Better suited for those already familiar with the Renaissance and medeival Florence than the neophyte, this book is neverthelessan entertaining read.  For an exhaustive history of Florence, look elsewhere.	2004-05-11
US	51070201	R1LP0DVZVLXD52	0195152956	664804877	April Blood: Florence and the Plot against the Medici	Books	4	3	5	N	N	An Effort to Tell the Other Side	Lauro Martines focuses on one of the defining moments of the Renaissance -- the failed assassination attempt on Lorenzo de Medici by his rivals, the Pazzi family, in the heavily researched &quot;April Blood.&quot;  In doing so, Martines hopes to balance the scales of history, which he sees as unfairly tilted to the pro-Medici side.<br />Before launching into the actual assassination attempt, Martines paints a magnificently detailed picture of life in 15th century Florence, including Florence's political relationship with the other states of Italy and the Pope, the astounding history of the House of Medici, and even some folk tales that give insight into the Renaissance Florentine character.  Too many histories attempt to view the past through the modern lens -- Martines bends over backwards providing his context, and he does so exceedingly well.  <br />Martines describes the capricious nature of Florentine taxation, which the Medici (particularly under the leadership of Lorenzo) manipulated to their benefit and their foes' sorrow.  Martines also describes the Florentine fixation on assassination, state-sanctioned capital punishment, and even the desecretation of a dead body as outgrowths of the Florentine character.  Through this description, we begin to see that the attempt to assassinate Lorenzo should not be surprising.<br />Florence, as a republic, did not cherish the tyranny of a few, much less one man.  In an effort to generate security for his family, Lorenzo made the Medici's position more precarious by raising up inadequate men at the expense of the other families who had a genuine claim to be civic leaders.  Among the most offended were the Pazzi, a famous, wealthy family in their own right, and a threat to the Medici.<br />This threat particularly came to a boil as Lorenzo's relationship with the Pope deteriorated (the Pope was a much more earthly leader in those days), and the Pazzi eagerly stepped into the void.<br />Weaving a complex web of storylines,Martines' does not tell his tale in a straight chronological fashion, and his occasional stops and starts interfere with the flow of his narrative somewhat.  This, of course, is the difficult task when providing an abundance of context -- when painting the picture one must move all over the canvas rather than in a straight line.<br />But this is a minor criticism.  Martines tells a complex story about the Pazzi's boiling frustration, the assassination attempt, and the Medici's horrible retribution -- which Martines claims was so harsh as to unduly burden the Medici clan in the future.  Martines does not tell a rousing tale, but rather one of melancholy resignation -- he has an obvious affection for Florence of that period, and it is frustrating to see what became of it in the wake of the Pazzi's attempt to axe Lorenzo.<br />In seeking to balance the scales, which so many pro-Medici hacks (and the Medici themselves) insisted on tipping after the attempt, Martines does a valuable service.  There are usually two sides to every story, and Lorenzo has had his side out there by itself for too long.	2004-05-10

For younger Americans who have always lived in a world where the CIA/FBI/Pentagon/Other Sinister Government Agency combo was the top secret snatcher and spy grabber, it will be hugely entertaining to learn about how recently the American intelligence network was virtually non-existent.  Can it be true that a guiding principle of intelligence was &quot;A gentleman does not read another gentleman's mail&quot;?!?!  Astoundingly, yes.  <br />Perisco's thesis, that FDR was perfectly suited for the birth of this network, is ably supported by Perisco's research and a bit of arm-chair psychoanalysis.  To Perisco, FDR was a titanic personality at a time when giants strode the earth -- Stalin, Churchill, even &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, an American intelligence agent with his own agenda and the energy of fifteen men.  FDR, restricted in the use of his body, used an astoundingly sharp mind and a practical streak a mile wide to bring about the creation of the American intelligence network while guiding America through the precarious pre-war years.  <br />Perisco is a hugely entertaining writer, and while &quot;RSW&quot; is a dense book, it is very readable.  <br />The only problem this book has is that, for all its readability and research, it has taken on a massive subject and one is always left with the impression that there must have been more to it than Perisco lets on.  While not quite crossing over into hero-worship in its near-veneration of FDR, one suspects that a few different stories may be told about this era and this subject, and they would be somewhat different than Perisco's.  <br />Perhaps my favorite section of the book is Perisco's pointed response to the allegations that FDR knew about Pearl Harbor in advance.  By using a combination of historical evidence as well as his fundamental understanding of FDR, Perisco convincingly debunks this theory.  <br />Through it all, FDR comes across as a very human, if very talented, figure, and Perisco's description of FDR's sudden decline would justify the entire book by itself -- fortunately, it doesn't have to.	2004-05-10

James Clavell masterfully weaves a tale of gigantic scope -- the clash of the Orient versus the West, civil war, religious strife, forbidden love, and the rise of Lord Toranaga to the position of Shogun.  To even attempt to tell such a tale is an astounding feat, and yet Clavell tells the story with such intimacy and power that the reader can't help but be swept away.<br />John Blackthorne, English pilot of a Dutch merchant ship, accidentally finds Japan after a storm blows his scurvy-ridden ship ashore.  He awakes to find himself in a beautiful, alien land -- a tall, blonde, blue-eyed European, he could not appear more out of place than among the short, delicate-yet-deadly Japanese.  Language is just one of the many barriers to be crossed.  While Blackthorne is horrified by Japanese brutality -- a samurai viciously beheads a peasant who fails to bow -- Blackthorne is also introduced to the wonders of Japan, such as the simple pleasure of a hot bath.<br />Much of the story revolves around Blackthorne's \\"education,\\" and how he learns to become Japanese.  While Blackthorne is one heck of a capable guy, Clavell wisely shows Blackthorne repeatedly struggling with the transition -- his difficulty learning the language is a nice touch.<br />Along the way, Blackthorne meets and falls in love with the beautiful Mariko, who bears the burden not only of a tormented bull of a husband (the warrior Buntaro), but also the curse of her family caused by a treacherous ancestor.  Blackthorne also meets the wily, sadistic Yabu, who boils one of Blackthorne's crew members alive for his pleasure and is one of the most unreliable allies one could wish for.  <br />Blackthorne also finds himself a major player in Lord Toranaga's undeclared civil war.  Clavell repeatedly throws Blackthorne and Toranaga from danger to peril, and their escapes are alternately achieved by daring, physical prowess, and intelligence.  <br />Further complicating matters are the Jesuits, who already have a strong foothold in Japan and have even converted some of the leading samurai . . . as well as Mariko.  Clavell's handing of the struggle between the militant Japanese spirit and the seemingly contradictory Christian ideals is particularly sensitive.  Like many of us, the Japanese fight to adopt Jesus' teachings into their world, in which the practicalities of life and death (as well as commitment to Japanese traditions) makes Christianity more than a bit burdensome.  Mariko's spirituality is particularly moving. <br />Rich in detail, \\"Shogun\\" spends as much time on a major battle between ninja and samurai as it does a slow tryst between Blackthorne and Mariko as they travel to Osaka.  Buntaro's perfect tea ceremony, an offer of reconciliation with Mariko, is heartbreaking in its sincerity.  Blackthorne, with a great eye for detail, is forever marking the exquisite details of this foreign land, and the reader feels as if he has tramped the hills of Izu, strode the halls of Osaka castle, and sailed the Japanese coast by the time the book is over.<br />Perhaps Clavell's greatest creation is Lord Toranaga, the ultimate puppet master in this epic.  Through Toranaga's humanity as well as his genius, we appreciate why so many are willing to fight and die for him . . . and through him we see the true worth of the other characters.  <br />All in all, a wonderful masterpiece that you won't want to end.	2004-05-04

Start with a prologue that shows or implies a horrifying death.  Introduce the hero/heroine as a smart, single, attractive committed professional, and drop him or her into a fish-out-of-water scenario for which he or she is perfectly trained.  Introduce sinister characters, including one anonymous character who appears to be pulling all strings from behind the scenes as well as his henchman, a lethal killing machine.  Toss in some technological marvels with compelling explanations and a plot to perform nefarious deeds on a grand scale, and you've got a hugely successful novel as you keep tossing your hero/heroine (and an attracive, conveniently single member of the opposite sex) from frying pan to fire.<br />Brown's two Robert Langdon novels benefit from the unusual expertise of the hero - religious symbolism.  Brown has an amazing ability to write clearly and convincingly about what must be daunting subject matter, and in Angels and Demons he gives a wonderfully compelling travelogue of Vatican City and its famed collection of art and architecture.  Brown also introduces a powerful element of the spiritual in this book, as we are thrown into the medeival feud between church and science.  <br />For those who critique Brown's works as factually inaccurate, I advise a step or two back for some perspective.  The man is writing novels to entertain and, to a much lesser extent, inform.  I have friends who are really, really into sharks, and they claim to hate the movie, \\"Jaws\\" because a shark would never a million years do what Spielberg has that shark do.  But they miss the point of the flick!  Brown is essentially doing the same thing -- setting a thrilling tale amid an exotic setting.  A few inaccuracies (or even more than a few) should not interfere with the exercise.<br />Readers of thrillers will probably guess at the ending a few pages in advance . . . but that's because Brown compels you to guess.  That's the heart of any good mystery or thriller -- the author essentially dares you to try and figure out what's going on, and then tries to jerk the rug out from under your expectations.  In this, Brown does yeoman's work.  <br />Perhaps Brown is a victim of his own success; he has been savaged by many, many readers.  Unfair, I say.  This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in some time.	2004-05-03

Brown has apparently always known how to write a page-turner -- &quot;DP&quot; drives you forward as efficiently and relentlessly as &quot;Angels&quot; or &quot;Code.&quot;  The relative weakness of the book is the plot, which just seems kind of silly in comparison to Brown's later offerings.<br />&quot;DP&quot; uses some Brown staples -- attractive, hyper-educated, likable characters get involved in revealing secrets that others will kill to protect.  Here, the secret involves the potential discovery of proof of alien life in a meteorite found under centuries of ice.  Brown knows how to write the action scenes well, and he does a great job of explaining the science underlying the discovery (as well as the critical verification of the discovery), which in the hands of a lesser author could have been as dull as a bad &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; program.<br />That being said, the whole enterprise is rather pedestrian . . . again, considering Brown's later triumphs.  &quot;DP&quot; is fairly predictable due to the law of economy of characters (i.e., since there are only a few important characters in a book, there can only be so many who could be responsible for any given action).  &quot;DP&quot; uses one of Brown's favorite devices -- the anonymous commander, who goes by a title rather than a name until the grand reveal later in the story -- to control the sinister Delta Force team who tracks and attacks our heroes.  &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Code&quot; also use the anonymous commander, but to greater effect.<br />The discovery of alien intelligence just does not rise to the level of the mysteries Brown covers in &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Code.&quot;  These later books have inspired me to visit the Vatican and Paris to see the religious symbols Brown writes about so effectively.  &quot;DP&quot; left me thinking, &quot;Hmm, meteorite . . . m'kay.&quot;<br />As a result, we don't care as much for our heroes in &quot;DP&quot; as we do for Robert Langdon and comrades from the later novels.  That doesn't mean that we're not gripped by Brown's description of being whisked over the Artctic shelf by parachutes in gale-force winds, or a dastardly deed committed by a Delta Force soldier and a fly-sized recon robot, or a gun battle on board a ship.  But the thrills are temporary, and I doubt that I'll feel any need to re-read this book ever again.<br />For the general reader, a 3-star review -- fun, but no great loss if you miss it.

Unsurprisingly, Denby gives brief descriptions of the works on the syllabus, paying particular attention to particular passages that struck his fancy.  More surprisingly, Denby also brings us into the classroom, discussing the professors in detail while relating the other students' efforts to master the material.  <br />These exchanges are fascinating because Denby refuses to patronize the students, who seem to be a genuinely scholarly bunch, capable of digesting and reacting personally to the material.  Sure, there are some low points, such as when the students run up against Dante and the eternal damnation of the &quot;Inferno,&quot; which the students seem to reject as &quot;so non-20th century&quot;(!).  On other works, the students are as engaged and insightful as Denby, even though they lack his life experience.  Denby avoids looking down on the students for their inexperience, and he tries to see the works from their perspective as well as his own.<br />Perhaps unexpectedly for Denby, his perspective isn't all that different from the students' in one critical regard -- he is reminded how difficult it is to keep up with the reading.  In some of the more humorous passages in a surprisingly funny book (not slapstick, mind you), Denby laments falling behind in his reading, or struggling to find a quiet place in Manhattan to read, or finding moments of solitude during the daily pell-mell of parenting.  In a refreshingly candid book, we are not force-fed another &quot;education is wasted on the young&quot; tirade.<br />Denby's various synopses of the books on the syllabus hit and miss -- of course, he is writing as much about his reaction to the books as the books themselves, and it's a bit frustrating when Denby doesn't fall in love with one of our favorites.  Denby's less-than-ecstatic reaction to the aforementioned &quot;Inferno&quot; is one chapter where I found myself shaking my head, disgreeing with Denby.  And one wishes that a few of Denby's chapters were longer -- but hey, if you are wishing for more, that's got to be the sign of a good book, right?	2004-05-03

Elliott builds his wonderfully poignant story of loss and penance to an ending that is both hopeful yet enigmatic; we hope for the best for our hero, yet we can't help fearing the worst.  <br />Told in a series of flashbacks from the present day to events in the distant and not-too-distant past, Tobia's story is one of struggling to overcome several obstacles -- the weight of family history, the adoration lavished on a sports hero who doesn't feel the same love for the game, the hurdle of his own potential, and, worst of all, the crushing guilt of a dirty trick gone horribly, horribly wrong.  At times almost paralyzed by fear and self-doubt, Tobia seeks for his true calling and is always asking the deep question -- is this what I am meant to do?  Fortunately for the reader, Tobia is suffuciently opaque that what often appears to be the easy answer just isn't enough. <br />\\"Coiled in the Heart\\" would have received five stars, but Elliott made two of his less-than-admirable characters, the Goodhopes, Carolina and Duke grads, and as any Southerner knows, some things are just unforgiveable.	2004-04-29

Ellroy's &quot;American Tabloid&quot; takes the Kennedy-Bay of Pigs era and throws it in the shredder, hacking through the Golden Age myths of Camelot and the reader's pre-conceptions about the JFK presidency.  <br />America has never looked so seedy or corrupt.  In a work that should be accompanied by a Quentin Tarantino-selected soundtrack, Ellroy spins a tale of duplicity, false alliances, and mutual interest that alternately unites and tears apart the men of the CIA, the FBI, the Mob, the Teamsters, and teven he insane Howard Hughes.  The trio of anti-heroes who drive the story forward, Pete Bondurant (hand-cuff snapping hired muscle), Kemper Boyd (Kennedy wannabe from the CIA), and Ward Littel (fallen FBI angel) rub shoulders with the Kennedys, J. Edgar Hoover, and other infamous movers and shakers from the period.<br />One hopes that Ellroy's exhilirating tale is not historically accurate, but Ellroy weaves enough historical detail that you feel as if &quot;you are there, live!&quot;  If even one tenth of Ellroy's tale *is* true, then we are reminded how fragile and savage our American experiment with democracy really is.	2004-04-29

This book (and its precursor) are the perfect shot of grain alcohol to obliterate the syrupy '60s image we see all too often of flower children, sensitive singer-songwriter-superstars, and the like.  Ellroy's vision of the '60s is harsh and certainly not for the squeamish, as Ellroy knocks icons such as Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King off their pedestals and gives us a J. Edgar Hoover as an evil Wizard of Oz, pulling levers and manipulating events behind his veils at the FBI.  Ellroy's previous characters, the haunted FBI agent Ward Littel and everyone's favorite French Canadian strong-arm Pete Bondurant, meet with a new cast of nasties, including the Tedrows, Wayne Junior and Senior.  A bunch of nasty people meet nasty ends (as do others), and nobody is allowed to ride off into the sunset.  While not quite up to the standards of &quot;American Tabloid,&quot; (perhaps only because &quot;Tabloid&quot; came first) this is an excellent read, particularly if you're a fan of Ellroy's rapid-fire style.  **** Definitely read &quot;Tabloid&quot; first -- the back story here, especially regarding Bondurant and Littel, is critical. ****	2004-04-27

Unfortunately for the reader, Tosches is very aware of this fact and wants the reader to be aware of it (the book refers to Tosches' &quot;legendary&quot; poetry readings!).  A series of riffs on truly tangential subjects (e.g., the woeful state of publishing in America today) undermines what could have been a great story.  When Tosches focuses on the task at hand, the book is gripping, and the sentences sing (sometimes with melancholy beauty, other times raging jazz, and still other passages sound like a dirge).  But the sheer weight of Tosches' ego overwhelms all. <br />The modern story of Nick's verification of Dante's original manuscript is far more engaging than the parallel story of Dante actually writing his masterwork.  Rather than building to a crescendo, this book also trails off towards the end, giving the impression that Tosches merely lost interest in his tale.  And by then, so had I.	2004-04-27

Anyone who has taken the cross-country drive with the family will recognize the America Bryson captures so well.  For every toxic passage that leads the reader to question whether Bryson is a misanthrope (e.g., his numerous descriptions of obese, tacky American tourists), there's a passage of pure delight, such as Bryson's description of the squares in downtown Savannah, Georgia.  Despite any clear plot other than to keep moving and see everything, Bryson through his wit and insight compels the reader to join him on this journey.  <br />It's an understatement to call Bryson funny -- several passages had me laughing out loud.  This is the first of Bryson's works that I've read, and I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of them.	2004-04-27

He has an obvious affection for some of his characters (such as Clark and Sacagawea), to be sure, but he also sees them as real people rather than demigods.  Montgomery's savaging of other characters is a particular delight.  This style is a plus, and makes for fun reading.<br />But the book is fraught with errors, as other reviewers have observed.  I'll content myself with only one, which should have also been caught by Montgomery's editor -- on more than one occasion, Montgomery refers to the duel between Burr and Madison, incorrectly substituting Madison for Hamilton.  While this mistake is so obvious that nobody is mis-led by it, it says little for the care that went into the writing and editing of the book and undermines its credibility.  <br />Is the book entertaining? Sure.  But it's got the same historical value as &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,&quot; and that's sad, because it could have been so much more.	2003-10-04

I do not refer to Mr. Kissinger's ability to convey his ideas or even their supporting facts.  I actually learned a great deal from this book.  However, Mr. Kissinger's style presumes great familiarity with the subject matter (which he obviously is).  However, as I read the book I felt as if I were listening to a lecture about people whom I hadn't met yet, but were just waiting down the hall.  In other words, \\"Diplomacy\\" presumes that the reader knows a lot about the major players with the familiarity of an intense graduate student.  I must confess that I do not, and the book's tone affected my enjoyment of the book.    Would I recommend this to a student of 18th-20th century western diplomacy?  Of course -- this book gets 5 stars for information.  However, before I would recommend this book as an enjoyable read, I'd ask the reader several questions first.      Perhaps I'm spoiled -- I just read \\"Miracle at Philadelphia\\" and \\"The First Salute.\\"  Bowen and Tuchman are masters at informing and entertaining -- I may have set the bar too high for Mr. Kissinger and other mere mortals.	2002-09-21

Dolt that I am, I was comparing apples and oranges.<br />On a second read, I appreciated &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; for what it is, an edge-of-your seat page-turner.  Mark Bowden brings the characters to life within the framework of a brief event, and I saw a much more human side to the story.  Sure, there's a lot of repetitive mowing down of Somalis, but that's what our men were forced to do by circumstance.  <br />The story of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; may seem trite in the abstract -- the good boys on the front line are let down by politicians back home -- but that's essentially what happened.  If anyone needs confirmation of the mess that represents our current African policy, read this book.  You could also read it if you are inspired by tales of true life heroism beyond your imaginings.	2002-08-20

I was surprised that Graves' Claudius is much less sympathetic than the character in the PBS production.  In the novel, Claudius comes across as more than a bit ruthless, and is quite the braggart.  Over-eager to shift blame from his shoulders to another's, this Claudius is no less entertaining.  Instead, his brilliance shines through even more, and his biting commentary on the world around him is a joy to read.<br />Another entertaining aspect of this novel is the larger role played by Claudius' childhood friend, Herod.  Claudius has so few intimates in his life that it is a treat to learn more about the ambitious, charismatic (and self-appointed) King of the Jews.  Herod's ultimate failure is even more saddening than it was in the series.<br />At times, &quot;Claudius, the God&quot; gets bogged down in the intricacies of imperial administration, but as this is supposed to be a memoir, that's to be expected.  While I appreciated learning about the daily life and toils of a Roman Emperor, at times the details of the projects runs a little dry.  Maybe I'm just impatient to read about all the murder and mayhem, but that's one of the things that &quot;I, Claudius&quot; prepares you for.  This book is a pleasure for both the casual reader and the student of Rome.	2000-10-20

McCarthy's writing is challenging, as he uses highly unusual words and phrases.  And yet his voice is always appropriate and his descriptions are captivating.  The key is to let yourself float along with the rhythm of the writing.  You don't have to understand every word to get the gist of what he is saying, and the rhythm conveys sensations greater than the mere words could ever achieve.  (In this limited sense, reading McCarthy is like reading Shakespeare.)  <br />McCarthy has created one of the most horrifying characters to roam the Old West in the Judge.  An otherworldly monster, I believe the Judge is Satan walking the earth, leading a band of killers deeper and deeper into evil.  The Judge isn't officially in charge of the Glanton Gang, but like Satan he keeps egging them on to greater depths of depravity.  The Gang ranges from one bloodbath to another, enduring the miserable parched heat of Mexico, and yet the Judge never tires, never falters, and never gets so much as a scratch.  Maybe he's a twisted version of Virgil from Dante's trilogy, guiding his charges into self-destruction rather than into Paradise.  In any event, he's so evil it's haunting.<br />Our witness to McCarthy's saga is the Kid, a character of limited vocabulary and blunt commentary.  We ride with the Kid, endure his hardships, and agree with his refrain, &quot;You're crazy,&quot; that he uses so often in his conversations with the Judge.  The Kid is no hero, however, and by siding with the Kid we are made accomplices in his various crimes, as well.  The conclusion of the novel is about as scary as it comes.  &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is a true delight, and I can't wait to read it again.	2000-10-12

Visiting from Atlanta, one is swept away by the peaceful tranquility of Savannah's  streets and squares, but one is also mindful of a rhythm guiding the  actions of the locals.  As an outsider, you can talk with the Savannahians,  share a drink, and have a great time spinning tales, but you get the  impression that you are on a different internal schedule.  Berendt captured  this alternate reality with great skill.  He also captured the pivotal role  that alcohol plays in Savannah society.  The city revolves around the  elegant consumption of booze!  I no longer live in the South, but whenever  I will need to remember the flavor and spirit of my former home, I'll break  this book out and give it a spin.	2000-07-10

The author's account captures several minute details that help bring the men and the mission to life (such as the  soldiers' memories of donkeys wandering around in the middle of a  firefight), and the reader is often swept away by the fury of combat.  But  the author repeatedly stops his tale to introduce new soldiers who have  appeared in the action for the first time.  This interrupts the flow of  action, and it also makes it difficult to develop an understanding of the  overall mission.  It's understandable why the author does so -- there are  many soldiers to introduce, and no single soldier is in every part of the  battle.  Rather, the battle in Mogadishu reads like a series of smaller  episodes forming the larger whole, rather than a linear progression.  It's difficult to keep breaking with  your story to provide background, particularly when the event described is  so brief -- we're not talking about the Battle of the Bulge, here.<br />Still,  the book is moving.  You can't help read about the selfless acts of heroism  by these young, highly trained men and help yourself getting emotionally  involved.  The author's extensive interviews with the soldiers are a real  treat, and there is an interesting twist to them.  Most of his interviews  were apparently with members of the Rangers, and we learn a great deal  about the unit.  The author was not able to obtain the same access to the  Delta Force members present in the mission, so all we learn about them is  what the Rangers saw.  It's wonderful to read about the Rangers, one of the  tougher units in the military, speaking of the Delta Boys in awe.  The  elite of the elite get their due in the book, as their acts are described  in almost clinical detail.  But their lack of a voice in the book gives  them an otherworldly air that is actually very appropriate, given their  training and purpose.  <br />All in all, Black Hawk is an excellent  \\"light-weight\\" history.  You will learn little about the overall  U.S. presence in Africa, and there are few \\"big picture\\" themes  to discuss.  But that was not the author's intention.  Instead, Black Hawk  gives a wonderful insight into the men who fight for our country and the  real conditions under which they operate, not the sanitized CNN version.   You'll plow through it in a couple of days, and it will go on your shelf  next to the Grisham and Koontz.	2000-07-10
