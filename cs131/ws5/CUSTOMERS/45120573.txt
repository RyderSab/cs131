The very best science fiction turns its focus to an alien place or time and shows how strange and even bizzare their customs and emotions are. And in the end we realize how much we share these traits.  Boulle does all of that in spades.  He also just happens to write well.  It is enjoyable to read and says something about our ethics and evolution.  It is a relatively short book in the number of pages, but long on edification.  The premise is absurd, but you will almost believe it because of how Boulle explains and describes each situation so clearly. A classic by any standard.	2005-08-29

That, of course, was the fun of the book.  Brown's style of writing and weaving of mystery and history was marvelous.  After reading it, like many people, I wanted to know how much was fact and how much fiction.  Bart Ehrman treats that very subject in his book called Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code.  He also does much more. I learned much more about the bibles and became more interested in scripture than I would have imagined.  Ehrman is an authority and try as I might I was unable to find logical fallacies or apparent bias on his part.<br /><br />He admits that Dan Brown was writing a fiction novel, but he takes exception to the fact that Brown didn't get all of the history correct, especially when it would not have impacted on the story Brown was telling.<br /><br />In the introduction Ehrman lists ten  \\"factual errors\\" in the Da Vinci Code and much of the book is devoted to exposing these \\"errors\\".<br /><br />Ehrman says that there is a natural tendency for some people to want to question what is generally accepted, but historians need to determine what is most probable.<br /><br /> He admits that historians have only the written record to go on, and can never \\"prove\\" anything. History is only what we read and if we compare various historical documents from various sources and they are consistent we must consider that the best evidence available. He also points out how the Hebrew bible and the Christian bible have changed over the years since originally written.  Only some original writings have been incorporated into what we now see published as the bible, and many of the gospel stories have been significantly changed.  There were many factions that produced lots of documents about Christ in early times and some were at odds with each other.<br /><br />I especially liked reading about the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Q document, The Gnostic bible, and Constantine's role in changing the bible.<br /><br />Ehrman spends some time in the introduction explaining his motivation.  He says he wants to set the record straight so people are not mislead by Brown's book.<br /><br />My conclusion is that Erman's book is good.  Since the DVC was obviously a fiction to begin with, I think it was interesting, but not very important that Ehrman exposed the \\"factual errors\\" in the DVC. What I liked most is Ehrman's description of how historians work and what we know and don't know about how the bible was compiled.e in the introduction explaining his motivation.

What I would like to say here is how pleased I am that Barry Sears uses scientific evidence and knowledge to come to his conclusions.  While many diet books seem logical, few others, if any, are based on good science.  This is a unique and facinating explination of why we are eating the wrong things. Unlike Dr. Phil and other popular snake oil salesman, this is based on Barry Sears' extensive medical and biochemistry background. It would be reductive to say much more.  Read the book and I think you will like it.  It just may change your life for the better. (And I don't say that lightly).	2003-12-30

Davis and Reuben Hersh<br />1981 Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston<br />  Is all of pure mathematics a meaningless game? What are the contradictions that upset the very foundations of mathematics? If a can of tuna cost $1.05 how much does two cans of tuna cost (Pg. 71)?  If you think you know the answer, don't be so sure.  How old are the oldest mathematical tables? What is mathematics anyway, and why does it work?  Can anyone prove that 1 + 1 = 2?<br />  This is a book about the history and philosophy of mathematics. I'm certainly not a mathematician, and there are parts of the book I will never understand, yet the balance of it made the experience well worth while.  The authors presented the material so that it is interesting and (mostly) easily understood.  They have a creative way of making a difficult subject exciting. They do this by giving us insights into how mathematicians work and create.  They live up to the title making mathematics a human experience by adding fascinating history.  Frankly I was shocked when they pointing out how even mathematicians have made questionable assumptions and taken some basic \\"truths\\" on faith.  They show the beauty of math in the \\"Aesthetic Component\\" chapter. Ultimately the question that comes up again and again is the question of whether or not we can really know anything about time and space independent of our own experience to make an adequate foundation for a complete system in mathematics.  If you have ever wondered about the world of mathematics and the personalities involved you might consider this book.  If you are a mathematics teacher you should read this book.  If you are a mathematician you could find it quite unsettling.<br />  It contains eight chapters, each one broken up into many subtitles so if you do get bogged down in the mathematics it isn't for long. There are 440 pages.  I'd like to see a much more complete glossary for people like me who need it.	2003-11-20

Frank Herbert was best known for his Dune chronicles, but also wrote many other books including nonfiction and was a newspaper journalist for many years. Brian Herbert did a worthy job of providing vivid details about growing up with his father Frank Herbert.  Frank Herbert was a rare science fiction writer who understood how to write about possible futures and hold the reader's interest.  Brian Herbert follows closely on the heels of his father and writes an interesting and detailed biography.  Frank Herbert, a highly acclaimed author, and justifiably so, had the ability to look beyond old habits, myths and superstition to go past the limits most people set for themselves.  The book contains a medley of fascinating anecdotes as well as thoroughly researched accounts of the successes and failures of Frank Herbert.  I especially liked the descriptions of how Frank Herbert worked at writing and how unbelievably energetic and exuberant he was in the many years before he was finally so very successful. The book is also a very personal and touching story of Brian's relationship with his father. Frank Herbert died in 1986, but we are still blessed with his literary work.  I feel I can better understand his work having read this biography.	2003-07-17

Peter Nichols writes brilliantly about a sailing race, one of the greatest ever really.  I knew parts of the story, but this book puts it together and in prospective.  Nichols is a gifted writer and is writing about something that he obviously feels passionate about, a perfect combination.  There is a bio of each of the racers, good descriptions of the boats and notes from their logs. The story unfolds as the race progresses and has many shocking surprises in the end. Most importantly, you learn about the psychology and philosophy of the very different characters as they wrestle with the turbulent sea and the huge mental challenge they face.  You don't have to be a sailor to understand or love this book.	2003-04-05

Although materials have changed, techniques and appreciation of the wilderness have not.  Raymond Bridge is right on when he explains how to camp and cook and travel in snow.  He has accurate and timless information on how to sleep warm when it is very cold outside. The chapter on safety including avalanche information is accurate and unchanged. Other subjects include things like solo travel, pace, planning a trip, finding your way, storms, making your own equipment and a checklist of equipment to take.  It was a pleasure to read this and see how accurate it still is.  It is not much different than recent books on the subject, with the hype about so-called breathable/waterproof materials left out.<br />Worth having in your library if you can find a copy.	2002-08-22

I read the other reviews after I had written mine and oddly (or perhaps not oddly) they seemed similar. Oh well.<br />I was very interested in how this book would be revised to cover this quickly growing and changing subject. How do you take the overwhelming explosion of products and ideas about backpacking that have developed over the last decades and try to write about them?  Well, Fletcher and Rawlins start by discussing that very subject.  How do you keep 845 pages on gear and technique from being a long pedestrian trudge?  I'm not sure, but somehow they combined personal experiences, wry humor and charming illustrations to do so.  The book abounds with illustrations that are as beautiful as they are functional.  Mostly though, they used their own unique writing styles to accomplish the task and completed a remarkable compilation of facts about backpacking gear and technique that reads like a novel.  The two authors take turns writing about each subject, sometimes each idea.  They seem to have similar philosophies (e.g., get out and do it, and gear is only a means to that end) yet the juxtaposing of ideas gives the book a fresh, and I think, healthy flavor.  With many fine (and some not-fine) books available on the subject they still managed to write a remarkable, complete, and interesting book that is not just a rehash of what has already been said.  Some of  (the late) Vanna Price's familiar illustrations from the original edition again bring the subject to life.  There is also some of the original text where appropriate.  Hannah Hinchman's illustrations do a nice job of taking up where Vanna Price left off.  More than just a \\"how to\\" book, the authors have managed to embrace \\"why to\\" appreciate the wilderness on foot.  Reviewers often say things like \\"nothing comparable\\" or \\"Without a doubt a classic\\".  This time it might be true.	2002-07-18

Horie if nothing else certainly has a sense of adventure.  This book is about his 94 day trip from Japan to San Francisco in a 19 foot plywood sailboat.  The writing is not entirely smooth, perhaps something was lost in the transulation. Nevertheless, it is honestly written and he does have a sense of humor. There are lots of amateur photographs.  There are some very good charts and several pages of detailed drawings of the boat (&quot;Mermaid&quot;). Good appendices on sailing and such.  An accurate, almost day by day, account of a very daring undertaking.  If you like true adventure stories you will probably like this one.	2002-07-15

It is like a Handbook of Physics for diving.  You remember how you had to learn about pressure and volume and temperature relationships in you basic diving class?  This book expands on those subjects and many others many fold.  Also chapters on decompression calculations, salvage calcs, air supply calcs, waves, current, light and sound underwater.  I have no idea how so much data could be fit into 182 pages, but Tucker seems to have done it.  Obviously a knowledgable person, also a good writer.  Well explained and wirtten, accurate and well illustrated.  Mostly technical reference data, but if you are a diver I promise you won't fall asleep reading this.	2002-06-28

His vision and exploration of the underwater world are breath taking, even today. He describes the mysteries of the sea and especially the consequences of mans intrusion into the sea. Much of the book deals with the history of  inovations that make diving what it is today.  I have read several books on the subject and find much in this book original and very different. For example, there is a discussion of a 1971  attempt to dive beyond the 270 foot record on air, and a fairly detailed description of Peter Small and Hannes Kellers 1000  foot dive in 1965.  Hunting u/w and treasure hunting, sharks and dolfins, law u/w are also discussed, among other things.  But I think it is the facinating history of diving that this book does so well that makes it unique and valubale to a person interested in diving or adventure.  An older book, but the ideas should never be out of date and some of his ideas were well in advance of his time. Dozens of photographs and some cute drawings and some historical reproductions of drawings. Good index and complete Bibliography.	2002-06-28

Ray Jardine has used his experience, education, and logical mind to improve on (by most often simplifying) equipment, technique, and I dare say the philosophy of backpacking.  I may never be an ultralight backpacker, but this book lightened my pack by 20 pounds!<br />...and for that it was most valuable.  Many &quot;myths&quot; of backing are debunked in this book.  He carefully looks at the advantages and disadvantages of each piece of equipment and how it relates to the goals of the journey. Just for example: tarps vs. tents. I particularly enjoyed his reasons for &quot;stealth&quot; camping.  He deals frankly with the bear and cougar issues and personal safety. I especially liked the section on sewing your own gear.	2002-06-07

It is not as complete as Ray Jardine's Beyond Backpacking. Not as well researched as Colin Fletchers Complete Walker.  I thought Kestenbaum didn't have much to add and his opinions were just that, his opinions.  Chris Townsend's book, The Advanced Backpacker, (oddly by the same publisher)is much better and seems to come from someone who benefited much more from his experiences.  There were some nice pictures and descriptions of gear, but then I can find that in my REI catalog!<br />I also liked the picture on the cover.  Save your money and purchase Jardine's book for ultralight, or Chris Townsend's book on long-distance hiking.  If you are interested in Mountaineering get Mountaineering:Freedom of the Hills.

He gives a nice little description of the long trails, with his comments and experiences.  His food choices and ideas alone make the book worth the price.  He includes the best description of chemical purification I have seen in some time. He covers boot fitting (one of the most important items, I think, in backpacking) like no one else I have ever read.

Among the many Mt. Everest tomes I have read this one is truly remarkable.  This is an honest account of a monumental achievement in the face of enormous emotional, cultural and physical barriers.  This exceptional person with an exceptional dream somehow found the ambition, skill and opportunity to achieve what no other American woman had done.  She walked alone onto the highest summit in the world. But not without facing failures in the process.  To simply say it took courage and ambition is an understatement.  Yet, in her words, the summit itself was ephemeral and gone in an instant. It is apparent that in the end what is important to Stacy Allison is the pleasure of living and experiencing. Climbing is just her means of doing that. Her message is, \\"Look beyond the ordinary.  There is always something more.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is a great story and well written by Stacy Allison and Peter Carlin.	2002-05-10

The desert revealed its secrets to this man who took the time to experience the place on foot.  Fishing in a creek, or climbing a mountain, or sleeping under the stars, Fletcher makes you feel as if you were there with him.  A great writer and explorer, Fletcher is a joy to read.

The clouds, the wind, the color of the valley, the trout, even the beetles and spiders don't miss his eye or nose.<br />He also describes the details of his hardships and joys, equipment failures and successes. He makes you feel as if you are with him on the trip, and often you may wish you were there. Some very well composed pictures are included. The trip took exactly 6 months. In the end he says \\"Then I walked down through the trees toward the road that would take me back to San Francisco and everything the city now offered.\\"<br />  I recommend the book to anyone.

Certainly an unparalleled achievement in diving manuals.  I can't claim to have read it completely, that will take a while, but it is obviously a very complete treatment of applied diving technology.  It is well organized, well written and very well thought out. Many changes from earlier editions, with up to date information on highly technical subjects. Also clear explinations of the basics: Physics, physiology, first aid and such. It is certainly for the serious reader, miles beyond the basic SCUBA manuals. It covers diving operations from an planning viewpoint also. It is the accumulation of the work of many of the most athoritative people in the field.

Dune House Atreides is a lively blend of adventure and intrigue woven into a stunning embroidery of the Great Houses of the Emporium. It is set in a time before that of the original Dune novels. The authors take you on a journey from planet to planet, character to character and bring them all together in a lively ending. Dune fans will find the history fascinating and some characters familiar. Newcomers to Dune stories will get a taste of what we all so much enjoyed in the original chronicles.<br />Sparkling descriptions of the environments of very different places and narrative portraits of some penetrating characters will keep your interest. A few of the characters are Elrood IX, ruler of the known universe, Baron Vladimar Harkonnen, Governor of Planet Arrakis, Pardot Kynes, Planetologist, Duke Paulus Atreides, ruler of the planet Caladan, and his son the young Duke Lito. The Baron Vladimar Harkonnen hunts people including a child named Duncan Idaho who eludes him. The young Duke finds himself in charge of his house at an early age. The Emperor Elrood's son Shaddam and his degenerate friend Hasimar Fenring are scheming evil plots. Meanwhile Pardot Kynes is discovering the ecosystems and native culture on Arrakis (a planet also known as Dune).<br />In the mix are the Mentats (humans with computer like minds), the crafty Bene Gesserit witches, and the dirty Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has a monopoly on space travel. The CHOAM is a commercial organization controlling the all important spice melange (noted mainly for its geriatric qualities).<br />Plots within plots, dark secrets and a few romances kept my interest for all of the 600 or so pages. I found this refreshingly well written and fluid. You will hate the bad guys and love the heroes. This book will leave you wanting more of the same and rumor has it Herbert and Anderson have at least a couple more Dune prequels coming out soon.uple more Dune prequels coming out soon.	2001-10-17

I think every description I have used in this book has been accurate.  It includes some handy small scale maps as well.  The Olympics is one of the best places to hike, winter or summer, and Woods is certainly the expert on the hikes and the history.  A must for anyone who is even considering a hike of any length in the Olympics.  Like one other reviewer implied, this book is way beyond the simple hike books that simply describe the popular hikes.<br />Add this book to &quot;Climber's Guide to the Olympic Mountains&quot; by the Olympic Mountain Rescue and you will have everything you need to explore the Olympic Mountains on foot.	2001-10-14

I liked it because it was well written and nicely illustrated, making it not just a good reference, but enjoyable to read as well.  This park is truly a unique place and the first of a most wonderful concept.  If you have any intrest in Yellowstone, or plan to travel there, this book will provide some rich history you should not miss.	2001-10-14

It covers Arm, hand, leg, foot, torso, neck, head, and builds up each part from bone to full surface anatomy from several views and several positions (flexed, relaxed, turned in or out, etc.).<br />The complete figure is covered in the last chapter.<br />A bargin at twice the price!	2001-10-14

It is used in our local college Basic Mountaineering class as the text and answers almost all the questions students have. I have had several editons and I am happy to say that they have updated technique and equipment descriptions in the new edition.  While different climbers may have different opinions about how things &quot;should&quot; be done, this book does an excellent job of recommending efficient and safe basic mountaineering techniques. After more years of mountaineering than I care to admit to, I still occasionally find something in this book that I can benefit from.<br />Certainly a must for people getting in to mountaineering.	2001-10-14

It is set in a place in time before the award winning Dune Series written by Frank Herbert. This book takes place between the prequels House Atreides and House Corrino in what is called \\"Prelude to Dune Triology.\\"<br />The story starts on the Planet Arrakis (a.k.a. \\"Dune\\").<br />Liet Kynes is son of Pardot Kynes, a person The Fremen consider a prophet. (The \\"Umma\\"). The Fremen are a rebel like force on the planet. They use guerrilla tactics, their culture includes centuries of religious mythology, and they hide from their enemies in caves in the desert. (Why does this sound familiar?)<br />The book is broken up into short chapters that take the reader from planet to planet. There is some connection between all of the characters, but some of the end game seems to be left out, perhaps to be played out in the next prequel.<br />Gurney Halleck is on Giedi Prime and looses his sister Bheth to the Harkonnen troops, only to find her and loose her again. Later he manages coincidentally to find himself on Caladan, the planet ruled now by Leto Atreides since the assignation of his father.<br />Duncan Idaho, who also has found his way to Caladan, then goes to Swordmaster School on the planet Ginaz. For all the drawn-out build up about the discipline and skill of the Swordmasters, I was happy to see that the Swordmasters, no matter how brave or resolute with a sword, are easily taken out with more modern weapons.<br />The cause of Baron Harkonnen's poor health is revealed and the highly trained Bene Gesserit sisters (\\"only total perfection is enough\\") have something to do with it.<br />The invaders of Ix (Taleilaxu) have been contracted by the evil empire to develop an artificial \\"spice\\" that could upset the order of the universe, if they can only produce it. C'tair, a member of the underground resistance on Ix, communicates somehow (mechanically aided mental telepathy?) with his brother D'murr who is a guild navigator. C'tair has some narrow escapes and in the end plants a bomb that does some real damage to the research aimed at synthesizing the artificial \\"spice\\".<br />Liet and his friend Warrick find a smugglers cave on Arrakis and there is the exiled Dominic Vernius, previous ruler of Ix. Faroula, the object of both Liet and Warrick's affection must be won by a ritual that in the end puts Liet and Warrick in a \\"which one of us will die\\" dilemma.<br />Rabban is Abulurd Harkonnen's ignoble son and just when good seems to triumph over evil (Abulurd plays Robin Hood and with Rabban's spice cache) Rabban returns and takes the ultimate revenge.<br />In the end Leto's son and Prince Rhombur are caught in a disaster on Caladan and Leto hires a Suk doctor to put Rhombur back together again.<br />The theme (at least one of them) seems to be that the evil empire, like the Roman Empire, will fall and good will win out over evil. However, that will take some time.<br /><br />Creating a vision of the universe prior to the famous \\"Dune\\" series is a formidable challenge and Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have done an elegant job of keeping the tapestry together. A \\"must read\\" for all Dune fans.nd in the end plants a bomb that does some real damage to the research aimed at synthesizing the artificial \\"spice\\".

I'll add another. It is difficult to exaggerate how interesting and exciting history can be when it is written like this.  Mass knows his subject but more importantly he knows how to stir our imagination.  He has combined diving, submarines, and some vivid characters in a ture story more extraordinary than most fiction. The sinking of the SQUALUS in 1939, the rescure of the crew, diving operations, and her eventful salvage were all fraught with danger.  Mass covers it all from begining to end. Accruate and poetic.	2001-08-16
US	45120573	R1O7ZPAPN1IL5R	0070419981	760025298	The Complete Guide to Choosing a Cruising Sailboat	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Fun to read, but more than you need.	This book starts by giving you an exam and rates your experience. Don't be discouraged by the exam, it isn't valid and I doubt it is reliable. Nevertheless, Marshall has some great technical information on all sorts of things to consider when you select a boat.  Best of all he has a spread sheet of statistics on a large number of production boats.  Selecting a boat is much of the fun of owning a boat and this book helps with the fun. The information doesn't seem to be unique, but it is well enough presented to make it worth while looking at, especially if you are new to sailing.	2001-02-22

This is a neat little book with lots of wisdom Gustafson apparently learned through experience.  Some \\"how to buy a sailboat\\" books seem to be written by naval architects or good writers with limited experience. But this one combines experience with science.  I have quite a few years experience sailing all sorts of boats in several locations and have owned several boats, but I still found myself taking notes while I read the book.  You will too, I think, enjoy this little masterpiece. When purchasing or researching a sailboat to purchace this book will save you time and help you make an informed decision.	2001-02-22
