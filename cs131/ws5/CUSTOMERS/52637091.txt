Pages magazine reviewed it, so I gave it a try. If you judge it from the first page or two, which reads like a history book, you'll miss a great story.  Some of the characters include a Native American who is 1/8th Polish, a retired reverend who is a recent widower, a down on his profits, rich inventor of a (Googleish) search engine, a fruit farm owner who is perplexed that his kids are finding foreign spouses, and several teenagers.  I love the subtle humor in this book.  I'll be looking for his next book.  Happy reading.	2005-05-20

I was kind of disappointed in this book.  I'm glad I got it from the library. It is a quick read, because each &quot;chapter&quot; is about a page, and they start it halfway down one page and finish it at the top of the next page.  Some are so short, they indented where they shouldn't have to make the chapter stretch out. The book is 288 pages, but if it was published like any other normal book it MIGHT be 100 pages.  This book should have been published as a story.  That said, it isn't a bad way to spend a couple hours.	2002-05-11

I enjoyed Pay it Forward, so I took a chance on this one.  This book is loosely based on the book of Job, but at one point, a priest tells the main character, that Job's family was restored to him, this of course isn't true at all, Job had more children, but his previous family didn't come back to him.  I couldn't like any of the characters, even when she went back in time to show what a lousy father he had.  It started out pathetic and got more so the more I read.  It finished with a Hollywood b movie happy ending.  Skip this one.	2002-01-17

I didn't think I would like the book because it seemed pointless to take so many road trips just for the sake of driving.  McMurtry shares lots of interesting observations about life and the people he met durning his lifetime.  He rarely interacts with anyone or sees the sites, on this trip.  But he talks about inspirations for scenes in his novels, as he passes the places he set the characters in.  He also share interesting tibits from his life.  It's not a humorous book, and he likely offends many people along the roads he travels, by insulting their habits, community or driving skills, but this book is an interesting look into his life.	2001-04-18

I thought I could read this book in about an hour, but I had to keep stopping. Nearly every story is heartbreakingly sad.  Our book group selected this book, and the leader said that the author wrote this while struggling with cancer and those emotions came out in the writing. This must be true.  I like fiction that celebrates life.  This book covers many of life's sorrows. I don't think I would read another book by this author, but I'm not sorry I finished this one. On to something happier, like a Jane Hamiltion. (ha)	2000-10-24

The book is suspenseful, and probable. I could not guess who the villans were, and that always impresses me and makes the reading more fun. The female characters are great. I did have to snicker at the sex scenes, I just couldn't picture a woman saying those things, especially about an outfit she had sewn herself, but I suppose it is the fantasy of the male author. Don't wait for the movie, movies are rarely as good as the book.	2000-10-16

Mr. Hillmer did a good job of weaving the story lines. Cruz is a very likeable character.  The book moves along quickly and you can almost feel the splash of cold mountain water from the Kern.  The book rings true to life, and leaves a residue of sadness.	2000-10-09

A book you will read with a smile on your face.	2000-09-30

It has all the elements of a book I would avoid, a disgusting sexual  relationship between brother and sister,  ax murders, and the death of a  child. If that isn't all bad enough, the murderer felt that God helped them  comes up with the lies about the murders. The author goes back and forth in  time, but when she is in the present time she writes facts about the murder  trial in present time. One line she is talking about what is going on, on  the boat, then we are back at the trial. This switching happens all the  time and is very distracting, she could have at least used a different type  when she switched, or spaced a line.	2000-09-04

When my book club picked this book, I didn't think it was my cup of green  tea, but I really liked it. Mr. Pham is a gifted writer who will take you  on a journey that will haunt your memory. It is really two stories in one,  his bike trip around the Pacific Rim and the story of his family and thier  escape from Vietmam. I hope the Mr. Pham writes more in the future.	2000-08-27

I love to find new voices, that I  expect to provide me with many future jewels of novels. Only a few authors  seem to have the gift of taking the english language and making it sing.  Mayla Goldberg is gifted in this way.  She shows us our characters many  facets.	2000-08-27

However, it is not about a journey home after the war. It is about how the home town had changed, and how they can deal with defeat with honor, and how can they go on. The  characters were very interesting, sad mostly. It also blended ghosts into  the mix, and the last third of the book was fascinating. The ending left a  mixture of hope and sadness. This book will haunt your thoughts for some  time.	2000-07-31

It can be done, and this book is a pleasant read. It won't be a classic, and I probably wouldn't read it again, but it was a pleasant few hours. If  you like this you should look for Sandra Dallas' books. It also reminded me  of Jan Karon's Mitford series.	2000-07-21

I am sorely disappointed in this book. I hate his style of writing. One sentence will be a paragraph long, and the next three are sentence fragments. He didn't make me care about any of the characters.  .........................	2000-04-26

The main character, looses his parents in an auto wreck, and never learns to form attachments. The ending left me without  hope for his future. I wish the author had taken the time to write one more  page to let us know things would be good in the future for these weak  characters, as it is, given their track record I have no hope for them. I  struggled through this book, waiting for growth for the characters and I  was disappointed.	1999-11-05
