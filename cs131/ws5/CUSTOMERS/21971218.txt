Most of what is in this book is already in Black Knight, White Knight. Except for the part about the affair with the married photojournalist.  She left him after 15 years (and somewhere in there her 3rd son committed suicide at age 22)because she met someone else.  However, the guy she's supposedly with at the end of the book, another photographer, she met previous to the married man. So I'm confused.  The printing style, without full justification, didn't help either.<br /><br />But she did give some brief information about being embezzled by her doctor and lawyer, and losing all her money.  Even though she didn't recover a penny of it from them, she was back on the street like she didn't miss a beat. It helps to have rich friends.<br /><br />One good thing about this book was the photos.  You get to see Gloria Vanderbilt not even looking like Gloria Vanderbilt (not so harshly made up and softer-looking). But the writing does seem dashed off and glosses over too much for me to give it but 3 stars.	2005-10-13
US	21971218	R37K0VMEE2VVLE	B0002YECOO	807587988	Life Inside	Books	3	9	19	N	N	Woe Is Me	Mindy Lewis was hospitalized in a teaching hospital for mentally ill adolescents and young adults, from the time she was 15 3/4 until she was a little past 18.  This \\"memoir\\" describes her family situation, her friends and the staff in the hospital, and her nutty behavior at times (drinks silicone grout on the spur of the moment).  Ms. Lewis blames everyone but herself for being put in the hospital. Prior to being admitted, she refused to go to school, took drugs, was promiscuous, and her mother could not control her. Her parents were divorced. Her mom worked and wanted a clean house.  Her stepfather walked around in his undershorts. All of this is pretty \\"normal\\", she finds out, for teens in the 60's.  Once Ms. Lewis is finally released, she goes through years and years of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, refusing to take any prescribed drugs for these sometimes debilitating conditions. Years later, she seems to have finished going through her phases.  She tries to call a few psychiatrists on the carpet about wasting two years of her life in the hospital.  But they don't seem to have too much remorse.<br /><br />Ms. Lewis has a way with prose, but the book is extremely disorganized and confusing.  She goes back and forth without letting the reader know that's what she's doing (in the end she justifies this by saying it was necessary for the book to  \\"flow\\").  Her best friend Marjee, somehow goes from age 13 to 17 (but most of the time she's age 13), while Ms Lewis goes from almost 16 to 18 in the same exact time period. She also somehow manages to graduate from high school by only taking an English class - and that only when she feels like it. I also don't buy the case notes of the staff as being genuine.  Another difficult story to believe was when she was in her twenties and had taken two jobs which started the same day, thinking she would considerately decide which one she wanted, on the morning she was to begin.  She has an anxiety attack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's). The cops take her to Bellevue, but she talks her way out of that. And where did she get the photo of her topless self on the cover? Did staff or another patient take it?<br /><br />I'm sorry this happened to Ms. Lewis, but I guess I've just read about adolescents who've had it a lot worse.  I've even known people who been through much worse. So Ms. Lewis's constant whining and feeling sorry for herself doesn't grab me and make me go \\"Wow - this is amazing, what this woman has gone through.\\"  It probably would have helped the book if she had included some of her much talked-about artwork, as well as photographs of her family.ack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's).

The authors are not only judgmental, they are hateful, and to top it off the book is full of inaccuracies. For one: Vivien Leigh's eyes were BLUE, not green. If they'd ever watched Gone With the Wind they would know that. True, in the BOOK Scarlett O'Hara's eyes were green, but that doesn't make Ms. Leigh's eyes change colors to suit. There are also numerous grammatical and spelling errors, as well as confusing errors in pronouns.<br /><br />The authors announce that female actors should get Norplant and males should get vasectomies as soon as they get their Screen Actor Guild cards, as they have no right to have children (they also shouldn't adopt - and they shouldn't have abortions either!). They mention FOUR deaths by overdose or suicides of the children of Hollywood stars/producers, then ask the reader \\"Do YOU know of any suicides or death by overdoses?\\" Well, yeah, I do. Hollywood parents don't have a monopoly on bad parenting, as they seem happy to pronounce over and over here. Where have these guys been?<br /><br />They claim that stars have C-sections in order to avoid stretch marks. Excuse me, I think a woman's body is about as stretched as it's gonna get at that point. And that Steven Bing did NOT want to have a child with Liz Hurley (why'd he have sex with her then - and not get a vasectomy?) And since Bing knows Bill Clinton, he should call Hurley a slut. Huh? But the authors make sure to mention that Bing \\"offered\\" child support to Hurley. They fail to print that Hurley turned it down.<br /><br />A whole chapter is devoted to how terrible Courtney Love is - I think we get the point. They call her daughter Frances Bean a \\"heroin baby\\". Tatum O'Neal's children are referred to as \\"spawn\\". Every time Tom Cruise's name is mentioned it has \\"the heterosexual\\" in front of it - about forty times. This is not cute or clever, this is childish. There's also something about an aluminum pan scam (the people selling it say it's not aluminum, but it is), and some girl who worked for AOL who communicated by email with not-to-be named stars. The authors make sure we know that they despise Hollywood's Liberal, Democratic politics.<br /><br />If you have ever read People magazine or watched Entertainment tonight, you know everything in this book already. The rest is nothing but the authors' suppositions put forth as fact, including horrible (unsubstantiated) stories about famous TV & movie stars/producers/directors and you're just supposed to guess at their identities and take this as the gospel truth.um, but it is), and some girl who worked for AOL who communicated by email with not-to-be named stars.

She's married and the mother of three grown children.  She has a college degree, but has never used it. She works part-time (VERY part-time) at the best arts and crafts store in CA, and she's very knowledgeable about making all sorts of things...except she can't seem to figure out how to close a necklace she's making.  Her husband's an engineer, and her 68 year old mother-in-law lives with them.<br /><br />It's a good thing Marilyn doesn't have to work for a living (she is at work twice in the whole book), because her mom who lives 200 miles away may have Alzheimer's.  This is never determined for sure, even though her mom is taken to a neurologist (black AND female, we have to be told).  She also takes her mother-in-law here and there sometimes...and Marilyn gripes quite a bit about it.<br /><br />Marilyn goes to the doctor to find out if she's in menopause (since she's moody, irritable, sweaty, etc.). Instead of finding out about that, the doctor tells her she's pregnant. The doctor also tells her she's \\"probably\\" in menopause.  Someone else tells her this \\"probably\\" later in the book.<br /><br />There is so much girl-talk, complaining, and worrying about menopause that I became quite annoyed at this unwanted menopause overload.  Not only that, but Marilyn very unrealistically never becomes upset when:<br /><br />She's pregnant and doesn't want to be.<br /><br />Her precious mom talks to her very strangely and is forgetting things.<br /><br />Her sister is on drugs and does not take care of her two small children (living with Marilyn's mom).<br /><br />Her sister wrecks her mom's car.<br /><br />Her son breaks his wrist.<br /><br />Her husband is having an affair (or so says Marilyn)and then takes a trip without her.<br /><br />Her husband behaves inappropriately with her son's girlfriend.<br /><br />She drives 200 miles back and forth several times to look after her mom and sister.<br /><br />Her pregnant, unmarried daughter thinks they say \\"no worries, mate\\" in London. (It's Australia, Terry)<br /><br />Everything is no big deal, when most women would need to be institutionalized. Marilyn just keeps on trucking. The only thing that really upsets Marilyn is when one of her visiting sons blows off her home-made dinner for a basketball game.  She throws all the food away. But absolutely nothing else makes a dent in her. Of course she has no financial difficulties and nothing but free time, so that does make things a lot easier.<br /><br />She despises pets (her mother-in-law has a dog), but she's the world's best authority on how to raise (other people's)children.  She can't wait to change the diaper of the son of girl who's doing her hair. Marilyn comes across as a selfish know-it-all. (She uses her husband's credit card to buy her mother-in-law some 100% cotton outfits - checking to make sure that they ALSO include 10% spandex - let me see this 110% material please).<br /><br />The ending was also unrealistic, with everyone making speeches that changed everything, for the better of course.  In my opinion, it all came to naught.\\"no worries, mate\\" in London. (It's Australia, Terry) <br /> <br />Everything is no big deal, when most women would need to be institutionalized.

This book is supposed to be daily affirmations, but basically is Stuart's year long diary. He is a member of several 12 step programs, and has really learned a lot from them, and has made friends who also attend them. One thing he hasn't learned from these meetings is leave his extremely dysfunctional family alone and quit trying to solve their problems for them. What I like about his book:<br /><br />Let go of the result.<br /><br />If you're scared to do something, go ahead and do it, and you'll wish you'd done it a lot sooner.<br /><br />What I thought was improbable:<br /><br />Stuart taking multiple plane flights to visit his family.<br /><br />Stuart going to bed for weeks at a time with Oreos, Hydrox, etc.<br /><br />Stuart never has any day-to-day problems that the rest of us have.<br /><br />His friends always have plenty of time on their hands to try to get him to get out of his bed and open up his door.<br /><br />Andrea losing 140 lbs in about 10 months.<br /><br />But other than that, this book has a lot to say.

Glad I didn't buy this, I read it in the store. The captions aren't funny, the pictures aren't funny. It would be an insult to purchase this for a dog-lover.

The story of Gloria Vanderbilt and Thelma Furness, born to a diplomat dad and a horrible, mean, snobby mother. The twins alternate their stories, but neither gives up much real information regarding their real feelings, if they indeed had any. It appears that they didn't have much. Mainly of concern to them were their clothes, jewels, and being in the perfect surroundings. Up to age 16, the twins traveled around Europe and occasionally to the U.S. They had an older sister and brother, but these siblings weren't worth much mentioning. It appears they didn't see them much, and when they were around, they weren't noticed. Their mother was a horrible woman, no doubt about it, and since she couldn't give affection, how could they?<br /><br />At age 16, around 1921, they moved to the U.S. with a generous monthly stipend from dad of $200.00.  Thelma quickly married a loser, and quickly divorced him. Gloria hooked up with Reggie Vanderbilt, also quickly marrying. The parents attended neither wedding - still in Europe, couldn't get on the boat on time. Gloria knew that she had to have a child to ensure that she could live off the child's trust fund, and Reggie wasn't too healthy.  According to Gloria, he'd been diagnosed in his college years with \\"sclerosis\\" and the doctor told him to drink only light wines. But Gloria said, he continued to drink \\"moderately, but steadily\\", and she had never seen him drunk. When he started hemorrhaging blood, she whisked him away for a \\"cure\\". As a matter of fact, they did an immense amount of traveling, and little baby Gloria was like her mom's siblings, not worth much notice, as of course the nanny was taking care of her, no need for mom to stay around.<br /><br />Gloria's mother suddenly turned against her with the birth of baby Gloria, seeming to think that it was her baby, and she must protect the baby's fortune of 2 1/2 million. Reggie died, and big Gloria continued to party and fall in love with a German prince, who according to her, had plenty of money and would have welcomed her child. She doesn't marry him because she doesn't want to move Gloria to Germany (even though it's okay for her to live in England, France, U.S., etc.). Sure. Gloria glosses over a lot...Gertrude Whitney wins custody of little Gloria, the nurse is discharged by the judge (he can tell she's a nut by her testimony), and Gloria only gets the child on weekends and the month of July, which are at a hotel, which the trust fund must pay for ($21,000 a year).  But, Gloria gleefully points out, Gertrude has to have her all week and can't leave the state without a court order, and what a pain that must be. By the time Little Gloria is 15, she seems a tiresome annoyance to her mother who has no patience or compassion for her teenage enthusiasms. Big Gloria apparently remembers things a lot differently than Little Gloria does in Black Knight, White Knight, but she has no qualms in proclaiming Little G cut her off, quoting both of their telegrams (Little G said she could no longer support her, big G said Little G was her sole means of support). Hard to believe a grown woman would expect her own child to support her and her lazy lifestyle, but she did.<br /><br />Thelma meanwhile, hops here and there living on the $200.00 from Dad, and $300.00 from Gloria and Reggie.  On this princely sum, she manages a designer Paris wardrobe, many ocean liner trips, her own personal maid, plus many plush hotel stays. Yeah, I don't think so. Thelma then marries a rich businessman Lord, he cheats on her and she cheats on him with the Prince of Wales (Big G says one of the most handsome men she's ever seen - well, we can all look at the pictures and tell for ourselves). Thelma is with the prince for several years and then leaves him to Wallis to look after. Thelma doesn't have much feeling for anybody either - she mentions her step-daughter's debutante ball is coming up and how unhappy to the tomboyish girl is about it. At the actual event, all she can talk about is how perfect the flowers are and how gorgeous the guest's attire. She makes no mention of her step-daughter Averill and how she fares at her own party. She also doesn't mention divorcing this husband, but she must have because she later visits him when he's remarried.<br /><br />Both women have many \\"dear friends\\" who come to their rescue in the nick of time - most friends they seem to make in a ten minute period at cocktail party or dinner.<br /><br />In the end, they have started their own perfume business (with perfume given to them by an admirer), and are no longer traveling hither and yon. I take it this business was not an on-going success.<br /><br />Overall, a very sad tale that money cannot buy happy family relationships.  That's for sure.mboyish girl is about it.

She's an imaginative writer who has a beautiful way with words.  At first it was difficult for me to imagine the words as coming from Starr, as they seemed more to come from Gloria - no father, a neglectful mother, looking for love in all the wrong places, but then the writing drew me in so well that it didn't matter. The one part she does not explain, is why did Starr have a breakdown after her cousin Andrew raped her, since it appeared she had well-tolerated everything else he had done to her, and even sought out his company.  Perhaps Starr didn't even know herself why...but there is definitely a change in tone in the book once that happens, and Ms. Vanderbilt handles it wonderfully, taking the reader into the disordered mind of young Starr, so confused and depressed, yet hopeful.  But ultimately unable to find her way to the better life that she deserved.	2005-09-06

Kristin Rossum was a cute young lady who loved the meth more than anyone or anything.  Like most druggies, she knew how to charm and manipulate to get her way.  Unlike most druggies, she had rich parents to back her up at every turn. They refused to believe this could happen in their family, better to sweep it under the rug, get her married off and let her become someone else's headache for awhile. Poor Greg de Villiers, who hadn't had much experience with women, fell for Kristin right off the bat, and she took advantage of it, by stealing from him, his brother and his roommate to buy meth. Prior to meeting Greg, she had asked her current boyfriend to rescue her.  He got them a hotel room, and while he took a shower, she cleaned out his wallet, and disappeared to Mexico, where she met Greg, her next victim. She later told this boyfriend that she'd been kidnapped and taken to Mexico, and driven around in the trunk of a car.  She said she lied to him to spare his feelings.<br /><br />When it was time to get married, Kristin repeatedly reminisces that \\"if only\\" her parents had listened to her concerns and stopped the wedding. However, she was a grown woman who could have done as she pleased.  She married Greg and proceeded to cheat on him with at least 3 men.  When she fell for her boss Michael, she was still writing her husband emails begging him to say he loved her.  She said she didn't have the guts to leave Greg because it would \\"hurt\\" him. So she continued to lie to him, cheat on him, drive him crazy, and probably drug him for the last weeks of his life, until she decided he was interfering too much with her meth use. Then she administered the fatal dose of Fentanyl.  Her boss/lover, who also hadn't got a divorce and was actually going to counseling with his wife, quickly claimed his mother was ill and hotfooted it back to Australia - out of reach of the authorities.  It's my personal belief that he had to know what was going on - if not before the fact, immediately after. The guy has a PhD, no one can be that oblivious to what's in front of you.

Surprise, there is no index of diseases.<br /><br />The only thing the book has is advice to lose weight: eat all organic, many fruits and vegetables, aspartame is a poison, drink eight glasses of water daily (distilled only).  You'd also best fast on juice for 21 days before you begin your diet - this will reset your metabolism.  It'll reset it alright - to slower than ever because your body will be thinking it's starving and trying to preserve its reserves of fat.  You also need to get 15 colonics in 30 days. Yuck, I don't think so. Also, you have to walk for ONE HOUR STRAIGHT EVERY DAY.  How realistic is this advice for the average busy person? I'm sure someone could lose weight with this regimen, but the human individual is unfortunately more complex than this - if it was as easy as telling someone that they should eat fruits and vegetables, grocery stores would be overflowing with organic items instead of processed foods, and there would be no fast food restaurants anywhere.<br /><br />The rest of the book is as the other lowest reviewers state: many recommendations to visit this or that website to get the real answers to your questions, which aren't addressed in the book as apparently Mr. Trudeau doesn't want his readers to know the \\"natural\\" cures either, unless they pay double for them.

You MUST be part of a church group, because you are only good enough to be another sheep following the herd, you CANNOT think for yourself, you must be led, also you better tithe to the church, etc.<br /><br />All this learning from your horrible suffering will take a long time.  Why must it take so long, you ask? Because we are slow learners.  God could have made us fast learners, as he is all-powerful, but he prefers to play games, and watch us suffer.  He gave his only son for us you know, and let him suffer terribly (still not real clear on that - if he's all powerful couldn't he have managed some other outcome?) And Jesus said, \\"Oh God, why you you forsaken me?\\" But Jesus is God, right? So Jesus could have stopped that...or did he just morph into God later?<br /><br />You are bad and imperfect and prone to being tempted by Satan. When (if) you finally have suffered enough to become like God, you get to go to heaven, and have the highest honor of sitting around and singing God's praises for the rest of eternity...yawn.<br /><br />I prefer Belinda Carlisle's motto:<br />\\"Ooh baby do you know what it's worth?<br />Ooh heaven is a place on earth.\\"	2005-08-01

Basically the spammers do as they please (spam, do Joe-jobs, etc.)and enjoy their money and their power to annoy and frustrate, while the anti-spammers spend hours on-line in efforts to out the identity of the spammers.  All this is good of the anti-spammers, of course if the government would get it together we wouldn't have to worry about this problem...or if people weren't so stupid as to order the stuff spammers offer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not muster any interest in either the spammers or anti-spammers.  The spammers were, as the author stated, \\"arrogant\\" and \\"psychopaths,\\" and the anti-spammers seemed quite pitiful - all wrapped up in their very time-consuming on-line battles with the disgusting spammers.<br /><br />This book left me feeling as though I had eavesdropped for months on people I couldn't care less about. And although the author describes in detail the various activities that spammers engage in, it offers no help to the decent among us who would like to protect themselves from their cruel onslaught.	2005-07-21

Ed Post and his wife Julie are at a convention in St. Louis. He gets up at 6:25 AM to go jogging, wakes her up because he \\"knows\\" she will want to have breakfast with him, and runs her bath.  When he comes back, she's dead in the tub.<br /><br />I have no doubt at all that he murdered her.  Many reasons:<br /><br />The shower curtain was INSIDE the tub. No woman is going to leave a shower curtain inside a tub when she takes a bath, and any man who regularly (as Post claimed to do) runs a bath for his wife would have the common sense not to either.  And as the book says, what woman wants to take a tub bath in a hotel - who's been sitting in that tub? She's going to take a shower.  What woman wants to take a bath at 6:30 AM in a hotel anyway?<br /><br />Plus, he first said that the water was not hot enough for her when she first tried it, and he had to add more hot water.  Later, he told another detective that she said the water was just perfect when she tried it the first time.  He tells someone else that the temperature of the water was \\"tepid\\" like she always wanted it.  Apparently he had no idea what tepid is, or maybe he realized that when they found her 30 minutes later, the water was already cold, which it wouldn't be if it had been HOT.<br /><br />Why would she grab the towel ring anyway?  If she's getting into the tub full of water, she would be squatting down and if she fell, it would be on her behind into the water. Who is going to stand up in a tub full of water?  You're going to let the water out, then stand up.<br /><br />The bruises found after her body had been disinterred. Water in the tub retarded bruising.  Bruises were found on her eye, and the back of her neck (among numerous other places).  Since these parts of the body are indented, not to mention on opposite sides, it's a little hard to claim she hit both sides in the tub or the floor.  One Medical Examiner's claim that the bruising was from the removal of her bones shows how stupid he is.  If your blood isn't cirulating, it isn't going to rush to the surface when it perceives an injury.  Your body can't perceive an injury if you're dead. Ed Post beat her, then held her face down in the water to finish her off.<br /><br />Witnesses: He'd beaten her before. He'd beaten at least one of his daughters. He visited prostitutes.<br /><br />Evidence: He owed a LOT of money.  Wife was insured for $700,000 (recent addition of $300,000).  Same day he borrowed $2,000.  Also owed her parents $15,000.  Many other debts. Not a guy who can afford this insurance.<br /><br />The author doesn't go much into the background of either Ed or Julie. Julie is portrayed as a horrible woman who criticized everyone she worked with, and was nicely put, \\"difficult\\" to work with.  Ed was a big talker who liked to exaggerate his military service, show off how much money he could spend, brag about his \\"very important\\" marriage, and very well-respected insurance agent.  One of the detectives claimed he knew Ed was guilty because of his extremely tiny feet - in his experience men with tiny feet were the perpetrators.<br /><br />The writing is rather vague at times.  The author talks about a grand jury being convened, and questions they ask.  Then mentions that the grand jury fell apart.  No mention of a later grand jury...suddenly, Post is indicted - but there's no mention of an arrest or bail.  He's just indicted and waiting for his trial.  Speaking of the trial, what the heck was wrong with the prosecutor?  He let all the witnesses get off without saying anything.  It's a wonder the jury had the brains to convict this guy.

They have a child, and on his deathbed, her husband makes her promise to never reveal her true identity to their child.  She quickly marries a 'poor\\" relation of her husband's without bothering to check him out first.  Celia is conflicted about revealing her true identity to her new husband.  As it turns out, as a child, Celia was tried and acquitted for the murder of her mother and attempted murder of her step-father.  In trying to protect her mother, she got a gun and told her step-father to let her go.  He then threw her mother on top of her, the gun went off and killed her, then Liza (her real name) shot repeatedly at her step-father, never managing to kill him, what a shame. Adopted by some distant cousins, Liza changes her name to Celia, but continues to beat herself up for this childhood episode.<br /><br />Strangely enough, her new husband buys her childhood home for her birthday present without consulting her, and murders and mystery ensue.  I must confess I figured out the instigator at the very beginning, but it was pleasant enough reading.<br /><br />Still trying to figure out the papier mache decorated porch...I think she meant crepe paper.	2005-07-05

The case: Woman says she is raped, husband kills rapist.  The book should actually be called \\"Anatomy of a Murder Trial\\", since it does go on at length about that.  I never could understand why an attorney from the State Attorney General's office shows up to assist (basically taking over the prosecution) the new DA.  And of course he's just as horrid as can be, and Paul Biegler, the defense attorney gets to make all the witty cracks, putting Dancer in his place, and win the case.  The book is quite different from the movie (which wasn't very good either), in that except for the Attorney General taking over the case, and surprise witnesses showing up with no notice to either side, the book makes more sense, and of course, has more detail to explain things.<br /><br />But instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the author seemed to want to show off his ability to blather on and on about nothing.	2005-06-29

He meets Luisa, a young girl who is apprenticed to a gay-hating clubfooted dressmaker named Renate.  Renate is quite possesive of Luisa, won't allow her phone calls, dates, etc., and Luisa puts up with this because Renate might give her bad references after her remaining 5 months of apprenticeship are up - as though there are absolutely no other jobs out there except seamstress.  Rickie and a gay girl, Dorrie, bend over backwards to try to help Luisa out of the situation, but she refuses to budge from her prison and move in with either of them, much like an abused wife afraid of angering her husband.  Although she did run away from her sexually molesting step-father, so that makes no sense.<br /><br />The story is very slow, with Rickie falling in love with any good-looking guy, just because of his looks, and spending much time deciding what to wear.  Luisa was madly in love with a young lover of Rickie's, but he was gay, plus he got murdered.  There is much bed-making, beer-drinking, pastry-eating, doctors making house calls in the middle of the night as a matter of course, and walking here and there, especially to the bar, Jakob's.<br /><br />SPOILER - in the end, when Renate's will is found, strangely enough, since she has known Luisa less than a year, she makes Luisa her co-beneficiary along with her sister.  The attorney has Renate's sister's address on file, but she can't be located.  Finally it's determined that the sister died OVER a year ago.  How is it that Renate was not contacted at least sometime within that YEAR?<br /><br />Also, the thing with Rickie's doctor lying to him. COME ON.	2005-06-22

But the second part, which mainly recreates Ruth's therapy with Dr. Pickens, leaves a lot of questions unanswered.<br /><br />Ruth supposedly lived a very quiet life, married to a quiet man, with two grown sons (one a doctor, who refused to participate in the book), working for Southwestern Bell as a secretary, living on a quiet dead end street. She worked for the phone company, then quit for at least fourteen years to stay home until her sons were in their teens, then got hired back on, and had worked there ever since.<br /><br />The author doesn't bother to check out anything that \\"happened\\" to Ruth prior to the first phone call. She claims to have been branded at the top of her thighs by a stranger when she was sixteen, when she was living by herself in Fort Scott, Kansas. The stranger supposedly chloroformed her, then she remembers seeing him heat up a flat iron (was it hers? his?) on the stove. Then she woke up and she was branded at the top of her legs! But not raped or beaten or anything. No one was ever arrested, and evidently Ruth was the only one this person felt the need to \\"brand.\\"<br /><br />In her middle age, with her sons gone, working at her long-term stable job, with her stable husband and stable home, Ruth's (interesting) life seems to begin when the Poet comes after her. Threatening phone calls, letters, kidnappings, telephone wire cuttings, presents of feces and urine, and knifings begin to occur when Ruth is supposedly afraid her husband has suffered a heart attack and she will be \\"abandoned.\\"  Whenever the phone calls and letters dwindle down and her husband remarks perhaps that is the last they will have of them, the calls and letters quickly begin anew.  Ruth's husband seems to enjoy being \\"deputized\\" and carrying a gun.  According to another book, Dr. Pickens said that Ruth was afraid of the BTK killer and subconsciously wanted 24 hour police protection, so she wrote these letters to get it. Ruth disagreed that she was ever frightened of BTK.<br /><br />Even after receiving threatening phone calls, letters, being kidnapped and stabbed, Ruth never really shows any fear of \\"The Poet.\\" Even though she has been accosted twice while window shopping during her lunch hour, she continues to window shop there during her lunch hour. You would think the police would have caught on: \\"You know, this lady doesn't really seem that bothered, and she really seems to enjoy the attention.\\"<br /><br />Due to her therapy sessions with the ever so sage Dr. Pickens, it's revealed that Ruth suffered horrible sexual abuse at the hands of a neighbor for approximately six months when she was three years old.  Remarkably, her mother never noticed (multiple times) that Ruth had vomited, that her pretty dress (that the neighbor admired) and hair were dirty or disordered, or that she had been bleeding (a friend/neighbor also wondered about this), when her mother was supposedly so critical and judgmental of Ruth. Ruth suffered from a distant, unresponsive mother her whole life, but then so did her brother and sister. What about her father?  He wasn't so bad apparently, but he seems sort of a ghost figure in the family.  Why were they always dumping her off, alone, on this male neighbor?<br /><br />At first Dr. Pickens writes in his report that Ruth knew the whole time what she was doing as the Poet, she just didn't know why. Since this would have gotten her in trouble with the police (the police chief had the same belief), Dr. Pickens later changed his mind (you know how psychiatry is) and decided that she suffered from a dissociative state and was not aware of what she was doing.  Well, how can that be, when she admitted to the police that she was writing the letters, and even how she had mailed a letter to Oklahoma City Post Office and requested thatthey mail it for her (so that it would have that city's postmark)? Ruth knew about the red bandanna material, and told the police there wasn't any more of it. They asked her how she faked the kidnapping and she told them how she took the bus.  She DID know what she was doing. Nobody probes this. Ruth denied making the phone calls or setting her Christmas wreath on fire. Although no one apparently asked Ed if Ruth had excused herself for a moment while they watched television, or even what time they started watching television, because she could have set it on fire before then. The window breaking from the heat was what got their attention.  Supposedly her husband and one of the police officers had heard a man's voice on the phone also.  The author doesn't bother to research what Ruth actually did, how she did it, or what she may not have done.  The police don't either, they just cart her over to the hospital.<br /><br />Ruth's job at the phone company is \\"taken away\\" from her.  The newspaper prints that Ruth's four year antics have cost the city around $350,000 for the police to investigate (she's never charged and she doesn't have to pay it back). I read in another book that the amount was closer to $370,000.  Ruth gets quite upset about \\"losing\\" her job (SWB pays her disability and when she's released for work, they give her a different position), and she gets angry when the newspaper publishes facts about her case.<br /><br />While what happened to Ruth as a child was infuriating, as an adult, she came across in these pages as rather boring and self-centered.  I find it impossible to believe that she wasn't aware of what she was doing, since she had to plan quite a bit to carry off some of these stunts. There was too much detailed plotting required. As \\"The Poet,\\" Ruth would have had to look up numerous addresses for the many threatening letters she sent. She had to purchase the red bandanna material and hide it, as well as the book(s) of poetry she used to help her compose.  She mailed bills and personal letters at the same time she mailed \\"Poet\\" letters to herself and others, while in the same car as her husband.  Did she have the \\"Poet\\" letters on top where he could see them?  I don't think so.  She knew to hide them - so how could she be Ruth, mailing her regular mail, AND the Poet mailing HIS threatening mail at the same time?  And why didn't the newspaper make note of who was answering her husband's personal ads to the \\"Poet\\"?  Who paid the invoices for these ads?  Ruth did, of course, but the author doesn't bother to delve into this.<br /><br />I believe there was a LOT left out about Ruth's prior life.  I think it's more likely that Ruth was histrionic and had many episodes throughout her life.  It appears that no friends or relatives were asked about her adult life, only the time after the \\"Poet\\" was revealed to be Ruth.<br /><br />Ruth was actually quite lucky.  Her quiet husband stayed with her and accepted her past hijinks as no big deal, her job paid her disability so she was not financially affected (except by whatever she had to pay of Dr. Picken's bills - but then she and her husband still had enough money to purchase a nicer, larger house later), she had a nice home, cozy job with retirement (and LOTS of disability), etc., etc. Best of all, she wasn't charged with reporting false crimes and made to pay back all she had cost the city for the police investigation and surveillance (nothing ever happened when Ruth KNEW the police were watching for the \\"Poet\\").  When her mother became elderly, was put in a nursing home, and died, Ruth doesn't appear too upset, because after all, she wasn't too attached to her mom.  But when an acquaintance suddenly kisses Ruth, she considers it heinous. Ruth somehow knows how to contact a hit man, and decides to have the acquaintance murdered.  She later changes her mind, and the man gets to live.  So how does this quiet woman know how to find a hit man?<br /><br />During Ruth'stherapy, she never seems to get to the point of becoming angry at the molester, or at her parents for not protecting her. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand Dr. Pickens.  Ruth, a much better poet than the Poet (a poetry book was found by the police in her wastebasket at work), writes him poetry to describe her feelings.  Dr. Pickens is a master at defining these poems.  Ruth is jealous of his other patients, wants to be his favorite, and wishes he had been her parent instead of her mother (how that would happen I could not figure out, since he was about twelve years younger than Ruth).  To me, he seemed just as distant, perhaps more, than her mother. He really seems to enjoy the hold he has over Ruth, and her infatuation with him. Dr. Pickens becomes angry with Ed, when he is finally allowed to come to a session (he's basically been told to butt out before), because Ed is focusing on himself and how he could have missed that Ruth was The Poet, instead of being supportive of Ruth. Hey, maybe Ed is a human being too! Maybe Ruth is NOT the center of the universe.<br /><br />This book will give you a small picture of dissociative disorder (so-called) but I found it disappointingly incomplete, and it did not convince me that Ruth should have been diagnosed with it.  The chief of police never bought her story, and neither do I.  Pay back the bucks you stole, Ruth.<br /><br />In a quote from Ruth in Weekly World News (not mentioned in this book), she stated:<br />\\"I don't know why I did it. I tried to figure out what was wrong with me, but I just couldn't stop what I was doing.\\" Funny she didn't want to mention this fact to the police who were guarding her 24 hours a day.

Bruno forces his company on Guy while on a train to Texas. Bruno reads a lot of mysteries and has come up with what he thinks is a perfect crime. Strangers commit murder for each other.  Since they have no motive, the police will never find out.  Bruno pulls information out of Guy about his estranged wife. Miriam, who cheated on him, now is pregnant by another man.  For some reason, Guy has put off getting a divorce, even though he has a rich designer girlfriend (a very understanding one).  He's going back to his hometown to meet with Miriam, at her request.  Next he's on his way to a big job in Florida, which will make his name famous.  However, Miriam tells him that her boyfriend is married, and she wants to stay married to Guy and go to Florida with him, for her convenience (to give the baby's Guy's last name). Guy's mom had opened her big mouth and gave Miriam the scoop about the great job, otherwise there wouldn't have been this problem. Guy tells Miriam no, then turns down the fantastic job, rather than go, and have Miriam show up as promised making a scene. We musn't have a scene.<br /><br />Guy goes on to Mexico to meet up with his wonderful girlfriend, Anne, and next thing you know, Miriam is murdered.  Well, Guy knows who's done it, but he doesn't call the police, for fear he will be in trouble.  For what?<br /><br />The funniest part of the whole novel is Bruno's perspective.  The good time he has finding Miriam, following her to a carnival with her friends, finding a cab in this tiny town at 9:00 at night (not likely)and the comments he makes to himself are hilarious.  True, he's an alcoholic and probably has some other mental health issues, but he does know right from wrong. He's not crazy.<br /><br />Well, Bruno decides to keep bugging Guy.  Guy's his hero.  Bruno doesn't really care too much for women or have much use for them (except his mother).  Bruno keeps contacting Guy.  Guy knows for sure by this time that Bruno has done the murder of Miriam, still he doesn't report it. What will Anne think?  What will everyone think of him?  No one will believe him, so he says to himself.<br /><br />He ends up going along with Bruno's plan to murder his father, rather than go to the police with what Bruno has done.  Is he weak-minded?

Other authorities on art did not run tests, but could tell just from looking at the statue that something was not quite right.  However, with all their training and education, they could not put their thoughts into words.  This is \\"blink\\".  When you decide something, based on your past experience.  Your decison may be right or wrong, depending on what your past experience is.<br /><br />So, stuff you already knew, basically. Because we all know things we don't know how we know, we just know.  But personally, I have enough sense to know when I don't know.  Gladwell thinks that Warren Harding was elected president solely because he fit the American's ideal of what a president should look like.  I must have missed the \\"What An American President Should Look Like\\" class in 5th grade.<br /><br />Gladwell kind of jumps around.  He talks about a professor who studies married couples, and based on whether they show contempt toward each other (rolling eyes), can predict whether or not they'll get a divorce and in how long.  What's the point of this?  Is this important work?  Gladwell also introduces a used car salesman, who never jumps to conclusions based on someone's race, sex or attire, and offers the same price to everybody. He's fair, and he makes a lot of sales through word of mouth and repeat customers. Something any car salesman could learn if he/she had been in business long enough.  So - that's not blinking.<br /><br />Gladwell doesn't back up his stories with any proof.  It all comes across as his own flawed opinion, or maybe just some hokey made-up stories, and I'm not buying it.  I thin-sliced and decided not to finish this book.  Luckily I didn't contribute to his wealth since I borrowed it from the library.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but Gladwell does less than nothing with it.does less than nothing with it.	2005-05-02

He's so bored listening to him that he wants to blow him off, but he feels sorry for the guy and doesn't want to hurt his feelings.  Dickie's dad pays Tom's way to Italy to talk Dickie into coming home to the family shipbuilding business and his sick mother.<br /><br />Instead, Tom is vastly impressed with Dickie's carefree lifestyle, while despising Tom's American female friend Marge.  Tom frets constantly about what he says and does around Dickie, wanting to win his friendship and impress him favorably.  That's why, when he cold-bloodedly decides to murder him in a little boat, it makes no sense.  This is the same guy worried about hurting an old man's feelings?<br /><br />Other things make no sense.  Why would there be bloodstains in a boat which had been submerged for several months?  Why does Ms. Highsmith have Tom worried that he will be found out for \\"all three murders\\" when he's only committed two?  Why does the Italian detective, who first met Tom impersonating Dickie, not notice when he meets Tom as Tom, that they are the same person?  Just because he puts on glasses and takes off a couple of rings?  Nobody is that stupid.<br /><br />I never felt empathy or sympathy for Tom, and I wished he'd gotten caught. However, there is something interesting about a story of murder and stolen identity.	2005-05-02

During the week he stays in a boarding house, but on the weekends he drives to his house in the country, which he bought under an assumed name.  Apparently back in the 50's you didn't need social security numbers or anything like that to get a loan.  David is in love with Annabelle, a girl he met two years previously in California, where they both lived. They had a relationship, and Annabelle told him that she loved him.  He moved to New York to earn enough money to marry Annabelle, unfortunately, one month later, Annabelle had married someone else (strangely enough, they move to New York, close to David's town).  David makes excuses for this action, and doesn't let it deter him from trying to make Annabelle his wife.  He writes her letters, which she sometimes answers, because he's sure that some certain phrase or word, which he may not even be aware of himself, will win her over.<br /><br />After living in this town close to two years, Effie, age 24, moves into the same boarding house and begins making eyes at Dave.  Dave also has a friend named Wes, who works at the same place he does.  Wes has his own marital difficulties, and tends to drink quite a bit.  Both Effie and Wes are a bit too curious about David's weekend trips - they don't buy the sick mother in the nursing home story that he tells everyone.  In reality, both of Dave's parents passed away many years ago, and he goes to his weekend house to pretend that he lives there with Annabelle.<br /><br />What's so great about this Annabelle?  Well, she has blue-gray eyes, brown hair, a long face, she used to play the piano, and she told Dave she had an idea for writing a book about a couple of composers.  She seems to have married only to get out of the home where she took care of her lazy unemployed brothers, disabled mother, and abusive father.  That's Dave's opinion anyway, although Effie is twenty-four, and managed to move out, get a job and her own place, so why did Annabelle have to marry the first loser who came along?  Question not answered. But it does make me come to this conclusion: Annabelle has low self-esteem, and at bottom thinks she's not good enough for Dave (what his relatives in CA who know Annabelle keep telling him: Water seeks its own level. But Dave wants to pull Annabelle up, and she doesn't want to rise). Although if Dave had stayed in California in some low-paying job, Annabelle probably would have married him.  That's why this story is so aggravating.<br /><br />In any case, Dave continues with his affair of the mind, contacts Annabelle, sometimes she sees him, leads him on, and he ends up confronting her husband, the wide-hipped, fat-lipped Gerald. Gerald tells him to stop writing his wife.  Dave doesn't stop, and Gerald comes to the boarding house to confront him.  Big-mouth Effie gives him Dave's address in the country (she and Wes nosily followed him one weekend).  Gerald goes, and boy is he sorry.  He's accidentally killed, and then Dave is really in a pickle, since he bought the house under a different name.<br /><br />Dave tries to lie and figure his way out of everything.  Overall, he's not really too concerned.  Then he drinks too much and makes a big boo-boo.  Meantime, Annabelle quickly marries another loser.<br /><br />The ending of the story is the usual cop-out.  But the novel is worth reading for the body of the story. Dave's unrelenting obsession, his single-minded search for his objective, the  emotions of the realistic, yet persistent Effie and the infuriatingly noncomittal Annabelle, make the interaction between characters memorable.<br /><br />One irritating error: at the end of the story both Annabelle and Effie end up 26 years old, although Annabelle should be 24, and Effie, at the most 25.er own place, so why did Annabelle have to marry the first loser who came along?

God's plan was that Amber Frey, a fine Christian young lady (who just can't stop herself from having unprotected sex with uncommitted partners) have a relationship with Scott, thereby guaranteeing herself a bundle.  It was all God's plan.<br /><br />I read this book twice, trying to view it from different angles.  As true crime, it's no good, as all Amber is interested in is Amber.  We are reminded many times, that she has God on her side.  Apparently God wasn't on Laci and Connor's side.<br /><br />The first two chapters are Amber's wonderful storybook romance with Scott.  On their first date, he brags that he travels all over the world, has family in Kennebunkport, ME, a truck, a big house, a Landrover and a condo.  Amber proceeds to get drunk (literally) on the thought of these riches, seeing Scott as a \\"good catch\\".  She jumps into bed with him and spends the night, heedless of her best friend's (who is babysitting Amber's small daughter) need to go to work in the morning.  Amber leaves Scott only when her friend calls to remind her again, that she must get to work.<br /><br />On their second and third dates, Scott shows up at Amber's one bedroom apartment.  Her daughter, Ayiana (what's with all the vowels?) falls asleep in her \\"favorite spot\\" in the living room while Amber and Scott proceed to the bedroom.<br /><br />Amber and Scott have much in common.  Amber likes \\"good wine\\" and Scott tells her \\"I have a really nice collection of good wine\\" as opposed to a really nice collection of sucky wine.<br /><br />Amber also has X ray vision to Scott's internal organs.  She tells the police that Scott's \\"stomach kept churning\\" as he told her he had lied to her about being married, and he \\"lost\\" his wife.<br /><br />Amber devotes the third chapter to her own background, but she's a bit sketchy.  Her parents split up when she was small.  She states that her mother worked in a hospital \\"in some kind of nursing capacity\\" (couldn't Amber ask her mom what she did?).  When not at work, her mom was \\"out on the town, hoping to meet someone new.\\"  Amber seems to prefer her dad, but goes from living with her mom to living with her dad, and back again, without much explanation as to why all this flip-flopping.<br /><br />Amber states that she graduated high school in 1993, and graduated from Fresno City College in 1997.  She'd been seeing a guy named Moises throughout high school and college, but during her college years she \\"got careless\\" and became pregnant.  It's not clear if Moises is the father, but in any case she had an abortion and felt guilty.<br /><br />After college, Ms. Frey begins a relationship with \\"Steve\\", a married man with a pregnant wife.  Amber generously forgives his wife's anger which she feels is mistakenly directed toward her.  Amber seems not to realize that she has only heard one side of this couples' story - and it wasn't the wife's.  Ms. Frey advises the reader (regarding the wife's anger over the loss of her husband's affections): \\"That's human nature, after all.  We all find it hard to take responsibility for our own actions.\\"<br /><br />Anthony comes along, and in the summer of 2000, Amber gets careless again.  Anthony isn't happy with this and splits.  Amber gets mad because she had \\"quit school and given up her job to help Anthony with his window cleaning business.\\"  She apparently forgot that she graduated in 1997.  After her daughter is born February 20, 2001, she stays home for six months, then enters a business college to get certified in massage therapy.  She obtains her certification March 5, 2002, and meets Scott November 20, 2002.<br /><br />She dates Scott for a little over a month before she finds out that he does have a wife and she really is lost.  Amber even got careless with Scott, but luckily didn't get caught.  Amber seems to bask in the approval of the detectives.  She ignores her massage business, driving to Modesto any time the police beckon as if she has nothing else to do.  She leaves her daughter with whomever (even though everything she's done, she done it all by herself, with no help from anybody! Except God.  He's on her side, you know!) Amber becomes furious with her sister Ava (who babysat her daughter quite a bit) for having the nerve to help in the search for Laci.  Ava doesn't rate a thank you in Amber's acknowledgments.<br /><br />Scott and Amber's dialogues are as if they are on two different pages of the same book.  She scorns Scott as he quotes the Bible to her, and seems more interested in finding out how Scott really feels about her and why he lied to her, than in finding Laci.  Amber is the star.  Laci is an extra with no lines.<br /><br />At Amber's first press conference, she announces: \\"Although I could have sold photos of Scott and I to the tabloids, I knew this was not the right thing to do.\\"  Instead she waited and wrote a book to be sold after the trial, so she could make some real money.<br /><br />During all this Amber begins a relationship as \\"friends\\" with David Markovich, a former employer.  Alas, she again gets careless and her friend is not happy at all. Amber gives birth to a baby boy, deciding to interfere with his horoscope when she finds out his due date is Laci's birthday.  She orders her doctor to induce her labor a week early.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Amber quotes more and more scripture, to convince us of her goodness and religiosity.  If Scott would only repent of Laci's murder, he would be more welcome in Heaven than 99 others who managed to behave as law-abiding citizens.  It's okay to sin, as long as you regret it.<br /><br />My stomach just kept churning.<br /><br />It's God's plan.aves her daughter with whomever (even though everything she's done, she done it all by herself, with no help from anybody!

NO one acts this way, all the time. Duane, an oilman who has $800.00 in the bank and owes 12 million, has a wife, a couple of girlfriends, and the most horrible, disgusting children who are abusive to animals and each other. Duane keeps wondering why his kids are that way, but he never guesses that it's because he doesn't discipline them, mainly because he's rarely around - either he's with one of his girlfriends or out on his boat trying to get away from everyone. And although Duane frequently bemoans the fact that he's broke, no changes are ever made to scale down on his comfortable lifestyle.<br /><br />His wife Karla, also has affairs, and pretty much does whatever law-breaking stuff she likes, and always gets away with it.<br /><br />Duane and Karla have an 86 year old housekeeper who cooks, buys groceries, and keeps their 12,000 square foot mansion clean. To make her interesting, the author has made her into a sumo- wrestling loving hypochondriac.<br /><br />Jacy, from 'The Last Picture Show\\" comes back to town to tease and aggravate Duane.  Although living in Europe for almost the last 30 years, Jacy still calls people \\"Honey Pie\\" and uses the same way of talking as the rest of the Thalia bunch. Jacy has lost one of her children to an accident (and left her other two in someone else's care), and of course she is the only woman in the world to have done so, therefore she must be spoiled and pampered and tolerated at all costs. She eggs Duane's children on to abuse his dog. Jacy thinks they're great kids.<br /><br />Meanwhile the \\"Centennial\\" is being planned. Anytime the Centennial was mentioned, I soon learned it was going to be boring, so I skipped those parts. The parade, the pageant, the beer-drinking. Duane mentions that he feels like the Cemtennial has gone on forever. Me too.<br /><br />Various women become pregnant by men not their husbands, while their husbands are impregnating other women.

The son later rewards the dad's great parenting with a new house, new car, and new furniture.  (His mom rates a new car and a hot tub).<br /><br />Mr. Kiedis meets most or all of the criteria for Conduct Disorder (as a child and adolescent)and Sociopath (as an adult). He brags on pranks that hurt others, but expresses no remorse.  He is super-critical of others, but seems always content with his own bad behavior.  Mr. Kiedis talks a Japanese virgin into having sex with him and seems to think he deserves an award. He goes into rehab (many times) and seems surprised to learn that his drug use has an effect on others.  This didn't stop him though - it's just something he mentions in passing.<br /><br />Mr. Kiedis seems quite enamored of himself and his ways.  He puts down others who don't have what he considers to be \\"style\\".  He loves pure white alabaster skin, and the word \\"exponentially\\".  When his best friend dies of a drug overdose, he blows off the funeral, preferring to jet off to Mexico with his girlfriend (of the moment) Ione Skye.  He has no problem kicking other band members out of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but when it's his turn to be booted, he pouts, whines, and just can't believe his friends would do him this way.  Hey! Probably what the other guy was thinking.  But the other guy is of course not as important as ANTHONY. He also knowingly has sex with an underage girl.

It is set in England, in the early 1960's.  Marnie is a young lady who goes from job to job, usually working only where she can embezzle money, leave, and then alter her appearance and use a different name.  She supports her mother, and the woman who takes care of her, Lucy Nye, in this method.  Her mother believes (or says she does) Marnie's story that she is secretary to a millionnaire. She pushes her views on Marnie that men are no good, sex is horrible, and it would be the most wonderful thing if Marnie never married.  Marnie has been stealing and lying most of her life, as she wasn't around the best crowd growing up, but she has no conscience,so this bothers her not at all.  The only thing she cares about is her horse.<br /><br />Marnie gets a job at a publishing company, steals all the employee's pay packets, and departs.  However, she is caught by one of the owners, of course the most handsome one, so when he tells her he loves her, she marries him to avoid prison.  She can't stand him because he's a man. Also, sometimes he is described as having pale, white skin, another time, he is olive-skinned.  Marnie doesn't want to have sex, needless to say, she finds the whole subject disgusting.  Her rather intellectual and controlling husband says this isn't normal, and hires a therapist for her.<br /><br />In the end all is revealed, although, personally, I don't believe that the situation with Marnie's mother would cause her to have all these blocks, or that at age five or six, she would have forgotten what happened.<br /><br />The ending, is much more realistic than the movie, and the author should be commended for making Marnie face her music.	2005-01-22

His father finds Cordelia, seventeen and beautiful, for him.  They visit her family, and it is decided upon.  No courting is necessary. Cordelia marries him for the money - she doesn't want to remain a seamstress the rest of her life: she wants to take it easy.  Not a bad deal, but Brook's father, Mr. Ferguson, runs the show and everyone must dance to his tune. Cordelia runs the house and apparently does a good job, although, what exactly this entails is never revealed.<br /><br />However, Cordelia's beauty has come to the attention of Stephen Crossley, who with his father owns those dispreputable music halls in their town. He only wants what he can't have, and since Brook is sickly, whining, and not too interested in Cordlia, she succumbs to Stephen's charms.  What follows is an illicit romance, and many family disagreements.<br /><br />The writing is strangely interspersed with Cordelia's thoughts, at least I hope they are her thoughts, because it's not really clear at certain times what the heck is going on.<br /><br />The author also wrote \\"Marnie\\" and there are certain parallels in the writing. Letitia (the sister of Mr. Ferguson who \\"dozed inanely\\") has head lice and was not too bright, which also describes Lucy Nye in \\"Marnie\\".

Although not the best writing style, the story does flow and this book turned out to be a page-turner.  Before reading this book, I had no fondness for Anne Heche.  I thought she was a perfectly adequate actress, but I believed her jumping from relationship to relationship (with whoever was the most famous or whoever had the most money) was a bit opportunistic, and maybe I still think that.  However, her book explains her actions.<br /><br />Anne believes that her father molested her - although she does not present any particular concrete memory to back this up.  She told her mother that she had herpes on her face, and her mother admitted that when Anne was a baby, she had what was probably herpes on her vaginal area.  Apparently her mother didn't catch them from husband, or if she did, she wasn't saying. What upset Anne so much was that her mother would never say she was sorry, or acknowledge that she was in any way responsible for not protecting Anne.  What's weird (to me) is that obviously her father was a homosexual who had gay relationships with other adult males (he died of AIDS), but according to Anne's story, he was also a heterosexual pedophile - what's up with that?<br /><br />Her father was a choir master who moved from church to church and her mother did not work (until much later).  Her mother somehow managed to feed the family on the $5.00 a week her husband brought home. It's obvious that many of Anne's memories are not clear, but that's the way it is for many abuse survivors.  Not only was Anne sexually abused, her father physically abused all the kids (her brother got blamed for stealing money - her father was the culprit), and the children were not allowed to ask questions and were punished for this.  Her mother stood by him because that's what a good wife does, and above all, she was worried about getting into heaven.  Although her mother told Anne that one of her little Jewish friends was a monster and going straight to hell, she later dated two married Jewish men herself.<br /><br />Luckily Anne was discovered by a Proctor and Gamble talent scout while in high school, auditioned for a soap, and got the heck out of that mess.  Her life afterwards actually went pretty smoothly - she seemed to get any acting job she wanted, got along well with others, and even had Steve Martin wanting to marry her.  Anne was in therapy at a young age, but unfortunately, went a little haywire somewhere in her twenties.  Due to her religious upbringing (all her mother cared about was Jesus' opinion, not her kids), and trying to deal with her dysfunctional family, Anne developed an alter ego, Celestia, who was the daughter of God, come to save mankind.  Amazing things happened, albeit slightly otherwordly, and Anne filled two books with the writings (in another language) of Celestia.  She also did drawings and poems.  I wish that she had printed some excerpts of these.  I think that along with those, some family pictures would have helped this book out tremendously.<br /><br />What I'm not clear on, is the day she was going to get on the ship to go to heaven, she took Ecstasy, which she said that \\"they\\" instructed her to do.  Was her fantasy afterward due to the drug, or would it have happened anyway?  Because she certainly seemed to wise up pretty quickly once she was in the hospital.<br /><br />Overall, I think Anne Heche has done a lot of work through the years on her emotional well-being, and seems to have it together at this point.  She definitely has a couple of things straight:  We are all children of God, and to love someone else, you must first love yourself.  Thanks, Anne, for sharing your story.two married Jewish men herself. <br /> <br />Luckily Anne was discovered by a Proctor and Gamble talent scout while in high school, auditioned for a soap, and got the heck out of that mess.

A novelization of the movie, written as though someone asked Jimmmy Steinway (the ad guy who kept trying to get his clients into \\"The Club\\") to write it years after he wrote the movie script.  You're left wondering: did this really happen or not?  Why did Stillman feel the need to write this book?<br /><br />Although it does explain certain character's motivations, which weren't really clear in the movie, it kind of goes overboard with a little too much insight, even for a novel. In my opinion, it wasn't realistic, and the characters were even more superficial than the movie.  In the movie, you know nobody acts that way in real life, but it's a movie!  And since when is the IRS a client of an advertising agency?  Why would the Charlotte and Alice both be only TWENTY years old in the September following their graduation from college? No mention of skipping grades, starting first grade at age four, or both of them going to college during the summer, in which case, they'd still both be twenty-one.  This isn't the 1930's where kids start first grade at age five, there is no sophomore year in high school, so everyone graduated high school at age sixteen.  Just a glaring inconsistency which bothered me.<br /><br />The movie is much more entertaining.	2004-12-28

Anne Beddingfield's father conveniently dies, leaving her young, beautiful, and finally free to search for a more exciting destiny than her small village can offer her.  Everyone wants to marry her, but Anne chooses to take her father's legacy (87 lbs) and buy a ticket on a ship to Africa.<br /><br />What follows is a boring, convoluted tale which I found a bit difficult to follow and impossible to believe, as stated facts kept changing at later dates.  The solution to the \\"mystery\\" when presented, is not plausible, and I found the ending entirely unsatisfactory. The story's main focus is the idiotically reckless and spirited Anne, whose delight in her own witty repartee got on my nerves.<br /><br />I prefer Miss Marple.	2004-11-15

Diane King was a small-town news personality, married to a man who was a former cop and former probation officer.  She announced plans to quit her job and stay home with the kids...he proceeded to stalk her with phone calls and letters with words cut out of magazines, which it appears that nobody did any investigation on. Brad was a passive-aggressive bully, Diane was an overbearing and opinionated control freak, and the combination of the two was not good.<br /><br />This book wasn't as well-written or researched as \\"Eye of the Beholder\\".

It's the story of Darci Pierce, who in 1987, faked a pregnancy (for about 11 months) then kidnapped a pregnant woman using a non-functioning gun, took her up in the mountains, hit her on the head, strangled her (with a monitor strap found in the woman's purse), then cut her baby out of her with a car key.  Darci then attempted to pass the baby off as her own, raising suspicion when she would not allow medical personnel to examine her.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author attempts to find some reasoning for Darci's behavior. Darci was adopted, hated her adoptive mother because she was fat, and fantasized about her real mother.  She became obsessed with becoming pregnant after a molar (growth of tissue, not fetus) pregnancy. She decided she was going to be a mother, the best mother a baby could have, even though she was only nineteen years old, and didn't give herself much of a chance to get pregnant for real. What she wanted, she wanted NOW, even if she had to lie to everyone and murder an innocent woman. Was Darci crazy, or a cold-blooded psychopath?  One psychiatrist claimed that Darci had different \\"parts\\" of her personality (but not Multiple Personality Disorder) which excused her from any culpability for her crime. Unfortunately, the doctor simply made herself sound like a loon on the stand in the courtroom.  What it boils down to, is Darci took what she wanted, got caught, and showed no remorse for her crime, or empathy for the woman she killed. Darci is a disgusting, depraved individual, who does not deserve to be called a human being.  She should be out in 2017.	2004-11-10

Luckily she had a granny with some brains who fought for justice for her.<br /><br />It's impossible to have any sympathy for Annette, her mother, who stayed with this man, even though she knew he killed her cat, and had no qualms about getting pregnant by him a second time (the first time he \\"made\\" her have an abortion at 5 - 6 months), even though she could not support herself and the child she already had by her first husband and had to keep moving back in with mommy.  Both she and Shane moved so many times: back together, apart, condos, apartments, rent houses, back with their respective parents - I could not keep up with all the moving. They were quite obviously immature and both expecting someone to come along and solve their problems for them.<br /><br />Even though Annette told Detective Duckworth her suspicions at the scene, he claimed she didn't, and that he \\"knew nothing\\".  So basically he did nothing, and luckily was reassigned to Narcotics. He couldn't even find out that Goode had taken out $50,000 life insurance policy on his kids - as far as he was concerned, this guy would have gotten away with murder, no skin off his nose, as long as didn't have to do any actual work. This book does not make the Houston and Alvin Police Depts look very good, but what is, is. They didn't do their jobs, the ME's didn't want to do their jobs, the wife-cheater DA didn't want to do his job either - luckily he resigned too!  The only ones who wanted to work and cared about justice were the female Asst DA, the woman detective, and the grandma turned private investigator. She may have raised two kooky kids, but she got it together and took care of things for Renee - she paid for her funeral, tissue testing the city refused to pay for needed for evidence, and took copious notes.  Thank goodness for them, or this guy would probably have murdered another of his kids.<br /><br />This is an interesting story, but not well-written or organized.  It may be necessary to tell, but there seemed to be too much about all the authorities infighting and personal problems.  There was basically zilch about Shane Goode's childhood or background. So no explanation of his psychological state or what happened in his life to lead him to this point.<br /><br />It could have been better.<br /><br />Hint: In order to write a true crime story that will appeal to and hold the interest of DISCERNING true crime readers, it's best that the author spend her/his time getting the scoop on the MURDERER - not the lawyers.written or organized.

The story by the woman whose husband had \\"affairs\\" (and she also did, to help keep the score even, I suppose) turned my stomach.  Although she claimed to be happy, it was plain to see that she was miserable.  That's no way to live...and she planned to have a baby soon? Wake up, lady.  Apparently she was so ashamed of her lifestyle she wouldn't even use her real name.  Then the story of the thirty year old wacko who became pregant by a married man (who rubbed her belly, and told her they \\"did good\\"), and ran home to Mommy and Daddy when she was 8 months pregnant because she knew she \\"needed someone to take care of her\\". This immature grown woman then continued to mooch off of her parents until her child was a toddler.  Her friends were surprised that she was happy and relaxed during this period - well of course she was - she didn't have to worry about money, child care, or a job.  Wonder woman did not bother to ask for child support from her baby's daddy because it was \\"her\\" decision to have the baby - she forgot that's money that is owed her daughter by her biological parent - she shouldn't expect her child to be supported by grandparents.  I doubt the writer of this essay would have been able to handle her financial situation if she hadn't had mommy and daddy to fall back on.  I wonder how her boyfriend's wife felt or if she ever found out he had a child outside of their marriage.<br /><br />But other than these two bozos, most of the women were thoughtful and intelligent.

This book is rather short and not too complex, but Ms. Springer does get the main points across.  What convinced me that Darlie definitely did it, no question, was:<br /><br />The luminol test after the murders - small bloody handprint and small butt print found on the couch, Darlie's footprints found in kitchen walking back and forth and to kitchen sink.  Blood in and around kitchen sink.  This was blood that was not visible to the eye.  This blood had been wiped up and did not show without the Luminol being sprayed and the lights turned off.  Luminol picks up a protein in blood and enables the markings to show up in the dark.  What this means is Darlie was busy wiping up blood stains before she called for Darin.  If you were attacked by an intruder and your sons lay dying, would you be busy wiping blood off your couch, IF YOU WERE INNOCENT? No, you wouldn't.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the \\"intruder\\" broke in the house by slashing the garage window screen from the INSIDE (the window sill of which the dust had NOT been disturbed), with a knife that was in a wooden block in the KITCHEN. And why would an intruder slash it all since it could easily be popped off from the outside?<br /><br />And the security lights were off when the police got there. The lights were found to stay on for 18 minutes.<br /><br />To some of the nitpickers, it makes no difference to the story which lawyer made the opening statement, or whether Darlie had an abortion - permission only given by her husband after she agreed to have breast implants.  Permission is not required by husbands in Texas, but anyone can see that she has had implants. For Darin to be bragging about the size of Darlie's breasts to the police when his sons were stabbed to death, shows where his priorities lay.<br /><br />Why did Darin go back to his and Darlie's old house to check the screens? What was his curiosity about them?<br /><br />Past history on Darlie included sexual abuse by a step-father, and narcissistic, histrionic behavior - she could not stand it when she lost the spotlight to Daryl at his graduation party, so she left, then came back hysterical, claiming to have been attacked, in order to get some attention for herself.<br /><br />A few days after her sons were brutally murdered, during an interview at the police station, Darlie pulled down her shorts and pulled aside her panties to show the officer a tattoo on her crotch.<br /><br />What mother whose children were murdered, when accused of the murder by police, would calmly say, after every accusation: \\"If I did it, I don't remember.\\" That's pretty much saying that she did it. But after she knew she was being arrested, she said, \\"I did not hurt my babies.\\"<br /><br />Darlie needed help, but never got it.  She didn't get what she needed from her dysfunctional family, who also need help. Did they really think that screaming \\"Liars!\\" at the prosecutors outside the courthouse would do some good? Or were they just venting their feelings? They should have done everything they could to make Darlie look good; instead, they made things worse in public opinion.<br /><br />What happened in Darlie's young life to make her have such rage? I have a feeling her childhood was not peachy. There was admitted neglect by her mother, she had to take care of her younger sisters, and the alleged sexual abuse by a stepfather (who after marrying Mama Darlie moved his new family away to avoid paying child support on his three children from his previous marriage).<br /><br />Were the two diet drugs having homicidal side-effects? What would killing the boys do for her? I can't believe that she wanted rid of them because of financial concerns. She might have been angry with them earlier (they had splashed out half the water in the hot tub), but why kill them when they are sleeping? Was she angry at Darin and wanted to get back at him by destroying what he loved most? Did she mean to kill herself and chicken out, or just not cut deeply enough?<br /><br />The only way Darlie will ever be free in her own mind is to admit her guilt.  She probably never will, because she is afraid of losing the support of her family members. Darin has failed a polygraph, so there is probably more to this story.<br /><br />The author goofs a few times: \\"perspective\\" witnesses, Rockwell, Texas instead of Rockwall, Maul for Mauk and repeats herself sometimes in the same paragraph. Overall she gets the story across very well.he probably never will, because she is afraid of losing the support of her family members.

He had no respect for women, as he probably did not respect himself. Rob seemed to need to exert control over at least one woman. The bizarre stalking and abuse of female coworkers would these days, have him in prison.<br /><br />Rob put Paula under intense pressure to meet all of his many demands before she met the needs of their children.  Paula's first child, Loralei, was mysteriously kidnapped at age 13 days.  Paula later admitted that she drowned her.  When she had a boy, Randy, she was relieved because now her husband had a son, which he much preferred over a daughter. This took some of the pressure off of her. However, if she was busy taking care of Randy, her husband Rob warned her to hurry up, and said that HE, her husband, came first. What a guy.  When Paula gave birth to another little girl, the pressures started building up, and she began having obsessive thoughts again about her baby girl.  Reading in between the lines, I almost got the feeling that Paula felt subconsciously encouraged by Rob to \\"get rid\\" of the girls, and that she then would be rewarded by him as having done something good. Or maybe not rewarded, just not punished further. Or maybe, she knew what those little girls' lives would be like growing up with a father like Rob, who clearly believed women were \\"less than\\" and was trying to save them the misery. Like women in Nazi prison camps killing their babies before the Nazis could torture them.<br /><br />This book conveys Paula's state of mind, and how she could commit these acts because at the time, she felt as though there were no alternatives available to her.  Rob kept her isolated, she had no support system, and she was very depressed due to her circumstances (living under Rob's rigid rules), the death of her brother (to whom she was very close), and childhood sexual abuse by her grandfather.  It was as though Paula never had a chance.  If she had never married Rob, her life would have been completely different.  I wonder how her son Randy fared after being raised by such a weirdo.  I'm afraid Rob would want him to be just like him, and see absolutely nothing wrong in it.r grandfather.  It was as though Paula never had a chance.

I think he probably did murder both babies for the insurance money, but the evidence as presented in this book would not be enough for me to vote for conviction.  Also, Missy wasn't that sympathetic a character, as it seems she didn't suspect her husband of murdering their baby until he left her for another woman. Then she gathered her info and recollections and began her crusade.<br /><br />This book didn't tie up all loose ends or erase all doubt, so to me, it was rather disappointing.	2004-10-08

The only reason he got away with it was because he was Elvis.  I can see by all the one star reviews that there are fans that will never believe Elvis did a wrong thing in his life, and seem to want to project THEIR feelings about wishing Elvis had married THEM and not Priscilla, onto the author.<br /><br />I found the book to be well-written and well researched.  I never heard of Priscilla winning any lawsuit against it, so obviously there is some truth to be had here.  And it does seem the most probable story - that Priscilla was not an innocent virgin, that she didn't want to come to live with Elvis, but her mother wanted to get rid of her, and her step-father was most likely molesting her.  I just remember when Priscilla was on a  Barbara Walters special and Ms. Walters asked her why her parents would ever allow her to go live with Elvis, she hesitated, then replied, \\"I was in love\\".  But she didn't seem sincere or happy in her reply, as if she wished her parents HADN'T allowed her to move in with him.  I mean, what normal parents are going to let their 14 or 15 year old daughter go live with an adult man, a pop star, really believing that nothing will happen?  Come on now.<br /><br />I especially found the revelations regarding Scientology enlightening.  Now I don't have to wonder about that anymore.<br /><br />If you have any curiosity about Priscilla's and Elvis's relationship, I recommend this book as it's chock full of interesting (if a bit depressing) info.	2004-10-04

The first story sets the tone - Sedaris is an observant but rather selfish child afraid that some undeserving neighbors might get his hard-earned Halloween candy (when they have the nerve to trick or treat on November 1st). Every essay has its own message - some sad, some funny, but Mr. Sedaris conveys his truthfulness throughout - even though it may make him look \\"icky\\" to some.  Of course he also gets his family members into the act and some of their foibles are amusing but in most cases understandable: the sister whose parrot tells her she's great, another sister, trained as a chef, who finds and sells castoff furniture and has a tarpaper kitchen floor, the brother who trains one dog to eat the feces of a smaller dog (YUCK - not understable), the mother who came to his rescue and tried to teach him some common sense, and the father who refuses to see the truth about tenants who rip him off and steal appliances out of his rent houses. At least we know those infomercials really do work...<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection of essays.	2004-09-28

Billy Beede is a sixteen year old pregnant unmarried high school drop-out, who lives with her one-legged aunt and former preacher uncle.  Her con-artist mother Willa Mae died six years previously of a self-induced abortion, and was buried in Arizona in back of her lesbian girlfriend's mother's motel, supposedly still wearing her \\"jewels\\" - a pearl necklace and diamond ring.<br /><br />The goal of these (and other colorful characters picked up along the way) is to dig Willa Mae up, get her jewels, sell them, and therefore solve all their problems.  It turns into a madcap adventure from Texas to Arizona, a trip undertaken with not much thought and even less money. These people don't think ahead too far...that would spoil the theme.  The story wanders back and forth in time, and the chapters are interspersed with \\"songs\\" written by the dead Willa Mae, which personally, I skipped after the first one.<br /><br />Ms. Parks writes excellent dialogue in perfect dialect.  Some of the things the characters do are believable, some are not...did people really jump into bed (or car, or outhouse) with strangers that easily in 1963?  And then seem taken aback when confronted with a pregnant sixteen year old with no husband? As if a husband, any husband, would immediately bring relief to the situation.<br /><br />A few things that irritated me: Billy, her aunt June and Uncle Teddy visit Teddy's cousin Star and her son Homer on their way to Arizona. When it's Homer's turn to speak (his chapter) he announces that Teddy is his uncle. Since Teddy and his mother are cousins, how does he figure that?  Even though he's a smart college boy and all.  Then at the end of the book, Billy makes a comment about something happening five years from now, as though it's already happened.  Doesn't make any sense. Also, I just couldn't figure out what the moral of this story was - Go for what you want?  Live your dreams? You never know what's going to happen? Or all's well that ends well?  Who knows.

This book is vastly researched, and gives so much info on the Bush family that I'm a bit overwhelmed.  I haven't finished yet (it is a bit wordy), but I've certainly found out stuff I never knew. For instance, George H. W. cheated on Barbara for many years.  (...)In any case, it's page after page of data regarding the Bush family tree, both of the George's business and political backgrounds, and just about anything you ever did or didn't have the desire to know about the Bush's. Most of it is pretty scary and disheartening, so this book is not for the weak and those easily upset by the unfairness of it all. But it will educate those who have the ability to process it, go from there, and make the right decisions. Let's use this book as (another) learning experience. Perhaps some Americans who haven't learned their lesson yet will wake up and smell the coffee.	2004-09-21

Her father was a well-known psychoanalyst, her mother an artist. She had one brother (hardly mentioned), and one sister, a twin (not mentioned much).  The most she writes about her childhood is that her father, previously married, had three children, one of whom came to stay with them for awhile. Wicky was blind, and apparently violent toward her mother and brother.  Her half-sister later told her that he obviously had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (the mother drank).<br /><br />Ms. Knapp felt uncomfortable and awkward around her father, but since there is not enough information about her childhood, I'm not really sure why. As it turns out, he was supposedly an alcoholic as well, although she had to ask a colleague of her father's if he thought so, after her father had died. Her mother apparently didn't offer her opinion.<br /><br />Mainly the book concentrates on the various ways that Ms. Knapp fed her addiction: what she drank, where she drank, when she drank, with whom she drank. Since she finally admitted that she was an alcoholic (but a high-functioning one - we must remember) she could then blame every wrong thing she did on \\"the disease\\".  She just couldn't help it.  She was involved with two men at the same time, Michael and Julian.  They both were aware that she was seeing the other, but she was compelled (because of the alcohol) to lie to both of them about where she was, with whom, etc.  Ms. Knapp became pregnant, and apparently told them both that they were the father.  One went with her to the doctor's appointment to determine pregnancy, the other went with her to get the abortion.  How cold can you be?  But she couldn't help it, she says, the alcoholism forced her to behave in this manner. Since her father had a long-term extra-marital affair, and he drank, well, it couldn't be that they were immoral or anything, it was the alcohol!<br /><br />The book leaves out a lot, but has the same refrain for many pages: I couldn't help myself.  Until I decided to stop. But, to me, it's like anything else.  You do what you do until you are ready to see the light (which in Ms. Knapp's case, strangely enough, was reading an article which quoted Shirley Maclaine).  But don't blame it on \\"the disease\\".<br /><br />After reading the book, I still don't know much about Ms. Knapp's life, but I do know what she liked to drink the most: white wine.  She died in 2002 at age 42 of lung cancer.ok leaves out a lot, but has the same refrain for many pages: I couldn't help myself.  Until I decided to stop. But, to me, it's like anything else.

At least up until age 26.  Basically it is a memoir of her growing up years, her need for her mother's love, and her mother's complete lack of interest in the fact that she needed that love.  With six children in a strict Orthodox Jewish household, it wasn't as though her mother did not have the time to spare for each child; she was just busy with invitations to business dinners, phone calls, and spending time with her husband.  Her father was a millionaire businessman, but she was never interested in obtaining his attention.  It was her mother whom Ms. Merkin obsessed over.<br /><br />Her mother was German, and wanted to become a surgeon.  If she had, she certainly wouldn't have had a very friendly bedside manner.  When Hannah (Daphne) cried, she was told \\"Your tears don't move me\\".  The children's nurse was allowed to do as she pleased: bang Hannah's head against the wall, spank all the children with their pants pulled down, even kicking one of them. When Hannah asked her mother why she had married her father, she was told it was none of her business. When she and one of her young sisters fought, her mother told them that they were both bitches.<br /><br />Although this was an apparently very wealthy (3 or 4 maids, the children's nurse, cook, laundress, chauffeur, a beach house with a pool) family, and Hannah took trips and had expensive (if not the ones she would have chosen for herself) clothes, it reminds you that there can be different kinds of abuse within a family.  What you see on the outside is not always what is on the inside.  This book reminds me of Small Sacrifices by Ann Rule.  Diane Downs said that as the oldest of five children, her mom did not have time to spend with her, and that some children just need their mother more.  Ms. Downs wanted to talk with her mother, but her mother spent her time with her father, not her...she grew up to kill one of her children, and almost kill the other two.  At least Ms. Merkin grew up to become a talented, successful writer, basing this book on her mother's indifference to motherhood, and using beautiful prose throughout.he other two.

I have seen most episodes of Sex and the City, and read Four Blondes, so I was curious to read this book.<br /><br />While the writing style is captivating, the characters are all over the place and the time period jumps back and forth from paragraph to paragraph - I'd have to re-read this to remember who's who and what they are doing when.  The one I bought has the extra two chapters at the end of the book about Carrie and Mr. Big - and even within the two chapters are flashbacks.  Rather confusing.  And I just couldn't figure out why Carrie wanted to drive Mr. Big away - self-fulfilling prophecy?  He didn't seem that bad to me - she could have made it work if she wanted to.  And what's this about a pickle at the end?  I didn't get it.<br /><br />This book is kind of depressing, but Ms. Bushnell pretty much warns of that in the foreword.  If that's how some of the people in NYC are, then that's how they are...shallow and ambitious.  I guess the book was informative from that perspective...and it was entertainingly written.	2004-08-30

There isn't much detail. Her mother divorces her father and she is no longer sexually abused, but she \\"acts out\\" and marries a bad, jealous guy.  He kills her dog by throwing him out a third floor window, her cat disappears, but she doesn't leave him. She does have an abortion because she apparently has figured out by this time that she doesn't want a child with him.  She leaves him, marries someone else, has a multitude of jobs, has a child, and many, many more pets.  What happens to all of these animals is mysterious, but I don't think that they live to a ripe old age, because they are usually mentioned once, then never again. Debbie is on to the next round of pets. She divorces her husband because he doesn't want to hold hands, and she knows that there is so much more out there.  Has drug dealers for friends (what exactly are they getting from her?), neglects her son, gets involved with more losers who beat her up and rape her, gets more animals, more jobs, gets drunk and causes a ruckus at her sister's wedding, but no big deal, joins AA, then begins a program to take care of street youth. Meanwhile, she still doesn't have it together in her personal life.<br /><br />This is a short book with large print.  The writing is vague and superficial.  Nothing in this book made me like this lady, although I am sure that there are many people who probably do. She just came across in the content of her writing as immature and self-centered.  She only recently figured out (after 50 years or so) that she wasn't \\"fat\\" or huge - she is 5'4\\" and was always within 10 lbs of 113.<br /><br />At some point, you have to take responsibility for the choices you make in life, even if your parents did call you \\"fat, stupid, and ugly\\". Be an alcoholic, drug-abusing bad decision-maker if you must, but don't bring innocent animals and children into your dangerous, chaotic environment.<br /><br />I strongly recommend you avoid this book, even if, or especially if, you were abused.

She discovers that she loves to be dominated when she angers a classmate and he spanks her with a pointer in punishment (yeah, it could happen).  When she is sixteen, and just graduated from high school, she meets an older man who falls in love with her. Developments ensue, and she discovers that she gains pleasure (the exquisite thing) from dominating him (in a very weird way - with his false teeth). Angela grows up (to 6'2\\"), becomes an artist, and meets a real jerk.  She leaves him when she discovers he has been lying about divorcing his wife.  For some reason, she leaves a lot of her finished artwork behind, and has to contact him to get it back.  In the process, he abuses his wife in front of her, which turns her on.  Angela is then invited to an artist's colony, where she meets a famous woman artist, who falls in love with her. Angela plays with Erika's emotions, almost gets her killed in a forest, then runs away with a rich man who falls in love with her at first sight.  They get married, and she tells him all her fantasies.  He therefore tries to oblige.<br /><br />This is a very strange book.  Angela seems aware that she cannot love, and that what she is looking for is really not a good idea, and doesn't really exist. But she never seems to learn her lesson.  She's rather unlikeable, and I didn't really care what happened to her.  This book left me empty and hollow with no hope for humanity.<br /><br />Part of the strangeness - the author also wrote Mercy, and she uses the same names of Mercy's teachers for Angela - Miss Talbacher and Miss Kellogg - even though this book is set in NYC in the 50's, and Mercy is set in Baltimore, MD in the 20's.  She even uses Mercy's last name as the housekeeper at the artist colony in Canada - Mrs. Bassford.<br /><br />Altogether a very weird book. Can't recommend.	2004-08-16

In the book, I don't believe her mother was ever mentioned, and \\"in the cut\\" is a sexual reference told her by her boyfriend, the cop.  Frannie is an unlikeable, actually boring character. She goes around writing down slang words and phrases and what they mean, as if those words and phrases won't be out of date by the time her book is published.  They certainly were out of date in this book, and I don't see much point it anyway.  That's it, her goal in life is pointless.  She has unprotected sex, leads men on, then rejects them, and seems to be an irritatingly stupid woman who doesn't know herself at all.<br /><br />I will say, that I did NOT like the ending (the movie is better in that respect, although Meg Ryan was completely wrong in this role), and every review that gives this book one *, I agree with your remarks absolutely.	2004-08-13

This book allows readers to see another side of Lucy, at least as far as her friends knew her. One of the amazing things is that she could attract and keep so many close, loving friends, who would (and did) anything for her, yet she was never able to come up with a snappy comeback for rude men who called her ugly.  Lucy wanted love from a man, yet was never satisfied or happy when she had it.  If she had ever found her &#34;great love&#34; she would have destroyed it.<br /><br />However, Ms. Patchett is as mysterious as Lucy about Lucy's family.  Did Lucy never reveal anything to her?  Lucy visits her mother once, her sister once, and once her twin sister and her husband come to visit to straighten out Lucy's financial mess (she didn't believe in paying her bills).  I take it that they weren't close...but that leaves the reader to imagine why.  Perhaps Lucy's constant demands for attention were too draining and they just couldn't handle it anymore.<br /><br />Ms. Patchett clears up other things though, that Ms. Grealy left out of her book: the fact that she only had six upper teeth and no bottom ones(she talked about a doctor &#34;accidentally&#34; knocking out two of her front bottom teeth, but no further mention of them in her book), she could only eat certain foods, one of her eyes remained swollen off and on since a certain surgery, and that more than a hip or leg had been used for taking skin grafts (her back was also scarred up), plus she had a jagged point on one hip, that a very lazy doctor left, and no other doctor bothered to correct. Ms. Patchett also discusses Ms. Grealy's breast implants, as the radiation therapy had stunted her growth, but not apparently her fertility, as she later became pregnant and had an abortion.  The whole abortion scenario could have been left out - I'm not sure why it wasn't, except to point out that the radiation had not harmed her ovaries? Or to let us know that Lucy was practical enough not to be upset about the abortion, but more excited about her book cover?  Or to let us know that Ms. Patchett is not leaving anything out, no matter how personal?<br /><br />This book is many things: a favor to readers, a tribute to a friend, a testimony of despair when that friend turns to drugs and becomes a typical, lying junkie.  Perhaps a catharsis for Ann Patchett?  If so, I wouldn't blame her.<br /><br />Of the many, many times Ms. Patchett runs to Ms. Grealy's rescue, there was only one time I could remember that Lucy did something for her - allowed her to share the stage at a book-signing event.  But it appears that Ms. Patchett never minded; she had gotten her own life in order, and Lucy had not.

I kept reading in the hopes that things would get better, that someone would finally realize Lucy's worth (perhaps herself) or that one single doctor would come up with a cure-all for her facial disfigurement. However, I was disappointed. Ms. Grealy left a lot of questions unanswered. Her mother \\"had\\" to leave her job that she had had for many years. Why? Her father died of pancreatitis - how did he develop that? Did he drink? Ms. Grealy admits that she was very detached about her father's death - and so too, it seemed was her twin sister. Was the sister identical? We are not told. Ms. Grealy may discuss things once (such as her relationship to school friends after her operation), then never mention these friends again. She states that her brother later developed schizophrenia, but doesn't talk about him, or any of her family members in any depth. They are not important characters. Basically, this book is all about her feelings about her face and how other people judge her (so she thinks)on her looks. Why does she care what they think? She seems not to worry about packing up and moving anywhere, so she is confident enough for that. She is given a generous scholarship to Sarah Lawrence, although she previously mentioned that she was a \\"mediocre\\" student. She moves to Iowa, she moves to Germany, she moves to England, she moves to Scotland. She receives many free reconstructive surgeries(or so she says), all the while not working a full-time job, or even a part-time job most of the time. She partied, she had friends. Ms. Grealy does not seem thankful for any of this, she is too busy wallowing in her self-pity.<br /><br /> Ms. Grealy seemed to pick and choose what she wanted the reader to know. I'm now reading Truth and Beauty by Ann Patchett. I'm only on the third chapter, but already know more than this book let on.<br /><br /> Ms. Grealy did suffer through awful surgeries, 2 1/2 years of radiation and chemotherapy (Although Truth and Beauty says 5 years - that would be a bit much), many horrible experiences in the hospital by nurses and butchering doctors who just didn't give a damn, and immature bozos in her school. They should be shot - and where in the world was her twin sister during all of this? Lucy speaks as if she were completely alone in school, so alone that she had to eat her lunch in the counselor's office so that these cruel boys couldn't attack her.<br /><br /> I hate that she felt so badly about herself. But she just couldn't let it go. I wish that Lucy Greely had found a good therapist and increased her self-esteem, taken her focus off her face and decided to concentrate on others who needed her. Her book really leaves me wondering what kind of person she would have been had she not had the disfigurement. I really get the feeling that she wanted others to care about her, but she didn't really care too much for anyone else.<br /><br /> This book could have been fleshed out quite a bit more to explain Lucy's experiences in life.  As it is written, it seems very one-dimensional. The only thing I can say is perhaps this book will be a lesson to us to be grateful for what we have, and to have more compassion and empathy for others and ourselves.y (Although Truth and Beauty says 5 years - that would be a bit much), many horrible experiences in the hospital by nurses and butchering doctors who just didn't give a damn, and immature bozos in her school.

It's the story of Mercy from age 5, to age 17: her home, school, and social life, and the many characters she encounters while trying to grow up. This novel is very down to earth, and Mercy (although born in the early 1900's) has a personality that I can relate to. When she wonders about God, she remarks that he is probably embarrassed, and that he has a heck of a nerve demanding that everyone worship him while praying to him obviously does no good at all, because he will do what he decides is best for you anyway(wars, etc.). She is not impressed by a religion that doesn't work for her, or for many people that she knows who only pretend to believe anyway.	2004-08-03

Although the characters still seemed a little two-dimensional, they were interesting and a little more like real people.<br /><br /> The story follows Rose, born at the turn of the century, and her descendants for the next 100 years. At times insightful into human nature, and at times very informative, it kept me reading chapter after chapter. I surely did not know that women used Lysol as birth control, or that a mere scratch could cause death. Ms. Jaffe keeps us informed at the beginning of every decade as to what was going on at that time. She discusses both World Wars, polio, the flu epidemic, and other current events. Although these items were sometimes educational, she misinforms about Rock Hudson announcing that he was gay and had AIDS. Rock Hudson did no such thing. It was rumored while he was alive but he never admitted it. If she got that wrong, what else did she get wrong?<br /><br /> Ms. Jaffe does tend to go on about ailments common to the time, and then have one of the characters contract it. For instance, when Markie's (Penny's daughter, Rose's granddaughter) boyfriend leaves her and recommends they both date other people, she has gynecological symptoms. She immediately gets checked out by her doctor who tells her that she has chlamydia, and that she is lucky because most women don't have symptoms. Markie immediately receives treatment, which should clear up the infection, right? However, a year or so later, trying to become pregnant, her tubes are blocked due to this chlamydia infection. I can understand having blocked tubes due to an infection left UNTREATED, but not one that was treated right away. Markie's tubes are blocked so badly from this (treated) infection that she requires in vitro fertilization, of course. The reader then receives the play-by-play of what is involved in that process.<br /><br /> Ginger, Rose's youngest daughter is reminded by an event in her own life of the novel Marjorie Morningstar. Either she or Ms. Jaffe didn't read the same novel as I did, because her take on the matter was surely not what Herman Wouk intended. Ginger seemed to think that when Marjorie went to Paris to bring Noel Airman back, she left because she found out that Noel was not what he was pretending to be (Marjorie knew well by this time what he was, and he had told her many times), and that she left Paris because she found out Noel didn't love her. On the contrary, Noel did love her and proposed marriage to her when she came to see him in Paris. She left because she finally got it through her noggin that he would not be a good husband, and his lifestyle was not what she wanted after all. She didn't stick around to sightsee in Paris (which Ginger said she certainly would have), because after undergoing such a life-changing realization, Marjorie just wasn't in the mood.<br /><br /> Another complaint I have about the book (go no further if you have not read it yet)is her treatment of the Joan/Peggy situation. Peggy and Joan are sisters, and Peggy is the smug, perfect one, married very young, living in the suburbs with her perfect husband and children. Her son is at day camp. Joan, the \\"different\\" sister, comes to visit. They are on the \\"lawn\\" (not sure if this is the backyard or front yard)sunning themselves. Peggy, out of the blue, brings up Eskimo Pies. This causes her 3 year old daughter Marianne to begin screeching for ice cream unrelentlessly. Joan wishes that Peggy, as her mother, would shut her daughter up. Peggy, however, does not. Joan then offers to drive to the store for ice cream. Joan gets in the car, backs up, and feels a thump. Marianne has run away from her mother, behind the car, and gotten run over. For this, Peggy hates Joan. Joan is a murderer. Joan gets the entire blame, although everyone realizes that Marianne was too small for her to have seen behind the station wagaon. Never does Ms. Jaffe have any of the characters address the fact that Peggy was not watching her own child, and was certainly more to blame than Joan. Joan feels so badly about Peggy hating her, that she contrives a plan to get Peggy out of her drunken depression, at a huge sacrifice to herself. Her plan works, but Peggy hates her even more for it. At the end, Peggy admits to herself that she and Joan both wanted Marianne to shut up, and she felt guilty that she DID shut up (forever). However, Peggy doesn't explain why she didn't bother to discipline her own child, and admit her responsibility for what happened.ve any of the characters address the fact that Peggy was not watching her own child, and was certainly more to blame than Joan.

I kept comparing this book to The Best of Everything (which was much better, no question). There was the normal, level-headed girl (Caroline), the crazy-in-love girl (April), the obsessed and previously slutty girl (Gregg), the divorced girl who falls in love with a married man and ends up getting him(Barbara), and the girl who does what she is supposed to do (Mary Agnes).<br /><br />  The young women in this book are composites of the above characters - Leigh is level headed and does what she is supposed to do, and also gets a married man - she has a happy home and helps out her friends. Cady is obsessive AND crazy in love with a married man, and Vanessa is slutty. (The Susan character is basically a non-entity) This book also reminds me of some of the characters in The Last Chance - especially Vanessa's flings and her anorexic daughter.<br /><br />  In any case, this book does have its good points. It chronicles Cady's almost 40 year, on and off again affair with a married man. As nutty as this experience seems, I know that life can actually happen this way. She also doesn't pull any punches with Cady's demanding behavior while living with Leigh. However, I just didn't get Cady's obsession with monogrammed silverware.<br /><br />  Ms. Jaffe also allows her characters to confront aging and their loss of attractiveness to men, as well as begin to think about future deaths and illness. Leigh, at least, comes to realize that her friendships with Cady and Vanessa are the result of being roommates - if she met them later in life she probably would not like them at all.<br /><br />  The book starts off in a rather banal manner, and I didn't know if I could finish it. However, the writing did pick up, and held my interest. I don't think Ms. Jaffe is as good a writer in this book as she would have liked to have been. Her descriptions of the girls, the men, and the places they lived, were sketchy, and I never really got the feeling that I was there with them. The male characters were interchangeable and almost opaque. Leigh's situation (chance meeting with boss in bar who immediately promotes her, then marries her) seemed completely unauthentic. I also found it extremely unlikely that as a 25 year old stewardess, Vanessa could not figure out how or where to obtain an abortion (surely her fellow stewardesses, sleeping around as much as she, had required this service), and simply let herself be carried along into marriage against her desire to have as many men as possible. The whole Susan thing was out in left field. It's as though Ms. Jaffe wanted to say something, but just didn't quite know how to put it together in a way that the reader could get something out of it. I tried, and I think I partially succeeded.ale characters were interchangeable and almost opaque.

For instance, if there was some sort of timeline that showed what Della/Dante was doing when, in her career of marrying up and up and in between marriages. How and where did she live? Pay rent? It's just amazing that she continued to get away with her behavior toward the men she dated and married, as well as her own family. Apparently the only \\"friend\\" who would be interviewed was her next door neighbor. And why was Gene (her brother) referred to as long-lost and the prodigal son? Supposedly her other brother Scott referred to Della as his \\"long-lost sister\\" although she really had just moved to Dallas with her new husband for a few months.  I just feel as though a lot was left out, and the book could have been better researched and more tightly written.

Books	1	63	267	N	N	Not For Me	I was (...) looking for a book about organizing clutter - wanting suggestions for containers, shelves, new ways to organize,etc.  I picked up and skimmed through this book, and found it amazing that there are some people out there that need to be told to throw away old crusty toothpaste tubes.  Is it possible?  And they know how to read too?<br />The writing was sickeningly syrupy sweet, and not my cup of tea (which you may have only after you have cleaned your kitchen for 15 minutes, your living room for 15 minutes, and your kitchen again for 15 minutes).  But you may only have your cup of tea for 15 minutes!  There are glowing testimonials from ladies who have used this book and website to change their lives (all misspellings are included) - the one I read was the lady who said she now had a better sex life due to FlyLady's cleaning and organizing methods.  This was a 30 year old housewife, who apparently had no idea it might be a good idea if she cleaned the house while her husband was at work.  Also, she learned that she could cook instead of order pizza, and give the kids a bath at night and read to them.  Oh yeah, and start washing her face in the morning.  All this turned on DH (Dear Husband) so much that...well, you can figure out the rest.<br />As none of this applies to me (I already take a shower every morning), and I can't go through my apartment looking for 27 items to throw away (they are already in the trash to begin with), or 27 items to give away (I keep a box in my closet for this purpose, and when it gets full, I take it to a local store that benefits a no-kill animal shelter).  So basically this book had nothing new for me.  And I'm not going to wear shoes in the house.  Any expert will tell you it is bad for your flooring, bad for your feet, and just plain unnecessary.<br />If you are in really bad shape and in dire need of someone to tell you to throw away empty shampoo bottles and such, this book may be of some benefit.	2004-07-14

Joseph Smith was most likely a psychopath, the same as David Koresh and Jim Jones.  It just goes to show there IS a sucker born every minute.  But I wouldn't include them only in Mormonism - most of the problems in the world are caused by organized religion - &quot;You don't believe what MY religion says you should believe - therefore you are bad and wrong - and I am good and right.

In order to get spending money and get rid of pesky husbands, Barbara killed them in their sleep for their insurance benefits. She was also a thief, brazenly stealing from the bank she worked at, and getting off with only having to resign, and a liar: when she didn't want to come into work, she merely said that she, one of her sons, or her husband was having surgery that day! And even when her mother-in-law was so upset about this that she told Barbara's mother, her mother acted like it was nothing! So you can see how Barb was raised: lying to get what you want is perfectly acceptable, even recommended. Barbara wanted to live the high life, with \\"nice\\" (expensive) things, but she knew no other way to get them but to kill her husbands for insurance money.<br /><br />This book was well-written, descriptive, and in depth.  Barbara was apparently an amazing employee and spotless housekeeper, she just couldn't stop competing with the Joneses or stop cheating on her husbands.  There was something going on with the relationship with her mother that just wasn't quite right - of course her mother always stuck up for her just like Pat's mother in \\"Everything She Wanted\\", by Ann Rule.  It's amazing how similar these psychopaths are when you've read as many of these books as I have.<br /><br />I keep remembering how one of her former friends saw her driving around in her convertible, a big grin on her face, just out enjoying herself, right after her second husband's death (before she was arrested).  I wonder if her two boys ever realized that she deliberately lied about and kept them from seeing their paternal grandparents.  In my opinion, the death penalty should have been carried out on Barbara.  She is breathing up other people's air.	2004-06-21

She took wonderful trips, married a man who loved her, and was trained as a registered nurse.  Her childhood was not good to say the least, but she certainly didn't do much to help matters.  Her relationship with one of her brothers was difficult to even read about due to the pain she deliberately caused him, seeming to really enjoy it.  Anybody who had anything to do with her could clearly see that she was not a decent human being.  Her own father told her he didn't have the money for a lawyer for her (when he probably did).  He loved her but he knew she was guilty and had to pay. Dana destroyed her marriage, lost her nursing job due to stealing drugs and lying, and was frustrated by her inability to get pregnant.  She vented her rage on innocent older women, brutally murdering them, then took off shopping as if that would help her feel better about herself. It's been awhile since I read this book, but as far as the plea goes, that puzzled me too, but I figured that since she had a public defender and there was so much evidence against her (eyewitnesses, the credit card use, etc) she figured she would never get off with a jury.<br />Some questions:  Who was the dark haired man with the beer belly who went shopping with Dana at the Sav-On and the outlet mall?  Where did the author get the little comments that Dana makes in her head upon entering her future victim's homes/shop?  Such as calling them &quot;fat barfly, how dare you judge me, you make me sick,&quot; etc. Also, how did she manage to qualify for unemployment benefits when she was fired for cause? The writing could have been better organized, some things explained more fully, and the author could have kept out all of the cops' personal information.

Her father enjoyed molesting her and shooting her pets, and her mother stood by her father no matter what he did.  Diane became obsessed with her very wishy-washy married boyfriend &#34;Lew&#34; who vacillated between his emotionally masochistic wife and Diane.  He told Diane he would marry her, then told her he loved his wife more than her...he was astonished that Diane blew a gasket at this news.  He then took a two week vacation with his wife to Texas, but came back to Arizona and asked Diane to move in with him in his apartment.  A lot of mixed messages there....since he didn't want to be a &#34;daddy&#34; to her kids, Diane shot them (blaming a non-existant stranger) in hopes that &#34;Lew&#34; would come after her.<br /><br />There are still some things that the book just didn't go into, that I wonder about.  Such as...why didn't her other two brothers say anything at all?  Only her sister Kathy and  brother Paul were mentioned in the book, but Diane had two other brothers who never came forward to speak.  Also, why was Amy Elizabeth Downs adopted out? Didn't Diane's mother or any of her family want to try to keep her?<br /><br />I'm now on my second copy of this book and could probably quote complete passages.  The book is well-written, well-researched and organized.  I feel as though I know Diane Downs as well as she would ever let anyone know her.  While reading the book for the first time, I had nightmares that Diane was pointing a gun at me and about to shoot.  I can imagine how terrified her children were to see the last person that they should ever expect to harm them at the end of that gun.  Cheryl Lynn Downs was the Small Sacrifice in order that her brother and sister would be taken from their mother and able to live a normal family life (as much as was possible) afterward.<br /><br />My second copy is now falling apart and I need a third.  After reading it so many  times, there are still things that bug me that Ms. Rule did not bother to address:<br /><br />What happened to the kitten that Cheryl brought home that day?  When they go to search Diane's apartment that evening, it is not mentioned at all. Neither is it mentioned when they go again later.  Did someone come and get it? Did the cops just let it starve?<br /><br />Why does Ms. Rule have such a weird attitude about &#34;Lew&#34; and &#34;Nora's&#34; marriage? She is staunchly on their side. It's all Diane's fault that Lew cheated on his wife, although Lew clearly states he was the instigator. Ms. Rule acts as though it's the most natural thing in the world for Lew to go on vacation with his wife for two weeks, come back and live with his wife for awhile, then move back into his apartment. Why did he move back to his apartment?  No mention of any disagreement with Nora. Then he asks Diane to live with him. This guy enjoyed playing his games and having two women fight over him, and acting as though he was helpless to make a decision. Nora even cusses Diane out because she &#34;had hurt him [Lew] so much.&#34;<br /><br />WHAT? As if he wasn't hurting HER by cheating on her with Diane?? Nora is so stupid she can't remember the word &#34;gonorrhea&#34; because it's too long? She never heard of it before? Lew gives her gonorrhea, then goes back to Diane, then Nora takes him BACK again?? Does Diane ever get treated? Doesn't say. Ms. Rule also doesn't mention how when Lew told Nora about the gonorrhea, they got into a huge fight and she yanked the gold chain off his neck. Now that's more normal. Instead, Nora talks about how it was Lew's birthday and they sure didn't feel like celebrating, so they just moved the furniture around! Yeah, that's a normal reaction to your husband telling you he's been lying to you about cheating on you, he has, and not only that, he gave you gonorrhea! Nora hears his confession, forgives him, and hangs on to her man! She must be like Diane and think she can't make it on her own without one.  Nora also tells the cop that one of the reasons she was a &#34;sitting duck&#34; for Diane was because Lew found a piece a land he just had to have, therefore, she then had to go to work. She got up early to fix his breakfast, then went to work. Why did she have to fix his breakfast?? Why didn't he fix HER breakfast?<br /><br />But Ms. Rule does remark on Diane thinking she had to have a man - the reason she married Steve was to get out of her father's house.  Ms. Rule says it never occurred to Diane that she could have moved out on her own and supported herself. So it makes it odd that she makes Lew's marriage sound as though it would be perfect if only Diane had left Lew alone. She leaves out the parts about Lew chasing Diane when Diane broke up with him. Lew does tell Diane he will leave Nora and marry her. But he changes his mind often.  When he and Diane have a fight and she blocks his car, he calmly walks to a payphone, to call Nora to pick him up.  Which of course she runs to do. Lew uses both of them, and when Diane moves, well, she just isn't convenient any more. It's easier for Lew to stay put, so he does.<br /><br />Another thing: the hospital personnel remove Christie from what Ms. Rule refers to as the &#34;right rear seat&#34; (which it is if you are behind the car facing it), in other words the backseat behind the passenger seat. Danny is removed from behind the driver's seat. Christie's shoes and airway are visible in a photo of the floor of the backseat behind the passenger seat. Cheryl is in the floor of the front passenger seat.<br /><br />Since Danny is paralyzed as soon as he is shot, it's unlikely that he switched places with Christie after the shooting.<br /><br />Jim Pex testifies about the distance of the gun from each of the childs' wounds, and that Cheryl had to have been in the floorboard.<br /><br />However, Christie incorrectly testifies that she was behind the driver's seat. Danny was behind the passenger seat. Cheryl was sitting up, awake, in the front passenger seat - not in the floorboard. Diane's lawyer tries to verify all this, and get her to say how it actually was, but she will not. Diane tells her lawyer that Christie has confused this trip with another trip, where the children sat in different places. This testimony is a huge discrepancy. But Ms. Rule does not remark on it. She does remark on Christie's drawing of the killer holding the gun in her left hand. That Diane is right-handed, but Christie is left-handed, so it's not a big deal. I would think not really knowing where you were sitting when you were shot was a big deal in a murder trial, but okay.<br /><br />When Hugi questions Christie, he asks a leading question - that the kids ate dinner at her grandparents? Christie says yes, they did. But they did not. They didn't because the grandparents were going out.  So they ate at Diane's apartment, where the cops found an empty can of ravioli in the trash.<br /><br />And Christie testified that she told both Susan Staffel and Paula Krogdahl that Diane shot them.  She told them this while she was in the hospital. So why was it so important for Christie to &#34;remember&#34; and have all the therapy? Ms. Rule never talks about Staffel and Krogdahl being told this.  Apparently they were not called to testify? Well, Ms. Rule doesn't say.<br /><br />An interview in Glamour came out with Diane's daughter &#34;Amy Elizabeth&#34; who was adopted and named Rebecca. She wrote to Diane, who wrote back crazy letters. Diane was referred to as &#34;delusional&#34; and &#34;deranged&#34; in the article. Was she always crazy? Or did she just become that way after years in prison? I have not heard before of prison turning a psychopath into a schizophrenic.<br /><br />I do believe Diane's father molested her.  As someone else said, she would have come up with a better story than what she had if it was a lie.  I still think Diane did the shooting.  If someone is in front of your car as you are coming down the road at night, do you stop and get out of the car? Maybe you stop and roll down the window a little, but who would actually get out? He would see the kids if Diane had left the door open, but it would be a little difficult to get around the door and lean in and shoot all of them. If he really wanted the car, he would have shot Diane and killed her, unless he was just mad that she threw the keys (he thought-since she &#34;faked&#34; throwing them). Diane just couldn't come up with a good story. Why didn't she just abandon her kids? Was it because Steve would get them and she could not stand for him to &#34;win?&#34;  If she gave them up to be with Lew, then she would be labeled a bad mother.  Did she know what she was doing? I think she did.<br /><br />Update: &#34;Lew&#34; and &#34;Nora&#34; did divorce November 20, 1989 and he remarried May 4, 1990 (gee, that was quick!).  He had married &#34;Nora&#34; on September 1, 1979, having divorced his first wife March 14, 1979.  This guy definitely liked getting married (and divorced). Oh, and his third wife had FOUR kids - ages 16, 13, 11 and 10 at the time of their marriage. Changed your mind there about kids, Lew, did you? You just didn't really want to be with Diane, and that was your excuse. If you'd just been honest with her, Lew, maybe she wouldn't have tried to get rid of the kids so that you wouldn't have to &#34;be a daddy&#34; to them.hristie's shoes and airway are visible in a photo of the floor of the backseat behind the passenger seat.

US	21971218	R1HSGL6LZB42TJ	0515103012	629245416	From Cradle to Grave: The Short Lives and Strange Deaths of Marybeth Tinning's Nine Children	Books	5	8	8	N	N	"All She Did Was Knock Them Off, One By One"	Very well-written and researched.  I've re-read this book many times, and each time I see a different aspect of Marybeth or the people around her.  Ms. Egginton gives opinions from various scientists and other examples of mothers killing children.  I do believe the theory Marybeth killed eight of her children, after possibly causing Jennifer, her third child, to be born with meningitis (because she wanted her born on Christmas, although I find it hard to believe that she would use a coat hanger. She would have damaged her internal organs, and probably wouldn't be able to have any more pregnancies. Also, it seems a doctor would have noticed any damage to her cervix.).  There is quite a bit of research into Marybeth's childhood, however, I wish that her brother had remembered or told more about her possible abuse at the hands of her father.  If you don't receive love as a child, you can't give love as an adult. It's no excuse, as she certainly knew right from wrong and had sense enough to lie about the deaths to everyone - I believe she mainly killed them since she learned of the attention it brought her - and because she believed she was a bad mother, could do nothing right, and might as well kill them to get it over with.  For some reason, she never learned her lesson, just kept trying again.  What would be a nightmare that most people (with consciences) would never recover from, was no big deal to Marybeth.  I don't think that she'll ever understand that these babies were human beings in their own right who deserved to live just as much as she thought she did. To her, they were merely extensions of herself, perhaps like a fingernail. It's pretty while it's the right length, smooth and painted, but if becomes damaged, or just starts to bug you, or you want a change, then cut it off and start over. She had no grief after her childrens' deaths, perhaps because she had no real feelings. She loved only herself, and was always looking out for number one. I wonder if she had Borderline Personality Disorder. She certainly had to be the center of attention, lied all the time, stole, and became scarily furious when confronted, and blamed and threatened the other person she'd told lies on (Rev. Waldo and her sister-in-law, Sandy).<br /><br />How could she do it, especially to the older ones - Barbara, Joey and Michael? That you would think she had become very attached to?  Maybe she just had to keep getting her fix - of the attention that the deaths brought her. She knew people were suspicious, but the need for sympathetic attention outweighed the prospect of being caught and &#34;punished.&#34; And she'd gotten away with it for so long, she believed she always would. I don't think she killed them because suddenly she couldn't stand their crying (although you'd be crying too, if you had the horrible, painful diaper rash that Tami Lynne had, that Marybeth couldn't have cared less about - she didn't have it, so she had no empathy for her baby's pain). She'd gotten both Barbara and Joey out of babyhood, and withstood their newborn crying, so that wasn't the reason.<br /><br />If Marybeth had not had Jennifer, or if Jennifer had been healthy and lived, I think she would not have killed Barbara and Joey. However, her frustrations and cries for attention would be vented some other, very noticeable way. Her husband, Joe, was a complete idiot to stay with her after she'd tried to murder him (don't have Marybeth pick up your prescription - she'll use the pills to poison her husband). &#34;There were things to make me suspicious,&#34; he once said to a Times Union reporter, &#34;but you have to trust your wife. She has her things to do and as long as she gets them done you don't ask no questions&#34; In other words, he protested that it was not his job to notice she was killing all these children - as long as Marybeth got her &#34;things to do&#34; done.<br /><br />UPDATE: Marybeth did admit to killing Tami Lynne at her parole hearing in 2009 - she said she was &#34;going through bad times.&#34; At her Jan 26, 2011 hearing, she stated, &#34;After the deaths of my other children...I just lost it. (I) became a damaged worthless piece of person and when my daughter was young, in my state of mind at that time, I just believed that she was going to die also. So I just did it.&#34; She said that if she were released, she would live with her husband.<br /><br />But I think she killed all eight after Jennifer died.ough bad times.&#34; At her Jan 26, 2011 hearing, she stated, &#34;After the deaths of my other children...I just lost it.

A: She despises the sister she does have, and feels that her mother never had time for her after her sister was born - why would she be sorry her mom had an abortion? (her mom was upset over John Lennon's death and just couldn't deal with it) and B: if she has a cousin with mental problems, what does that have to do with her not having an abortion?<br />IF Phoebe were actually gifted, she would probably know that it is Down Syndrome, NOT Down's Syndrome, it is nauseated, not nauseous, and that Rosemary Kennedy was NOT mentally retarded.  She was possibly dyslexic, did not kowtow to her parents or fit in with their staid image (it was okay for her Dad to cheat on her mother, though).  Her father, Joe Kennedy, had her lobotomized in hopes of calming her down.  The operation destroyed her ability to care for herself, which meant that they had to put her away where no one would know what they had done to their child.([...])<br />The book has lots of annoying, cutesy repartee that never happens in real life (thank goodness).  Also, luckily for Phoebe, a best friend (same age) who moves to Paris and immediately becomes a filthy RICH dancing star.  The best friend, who assured Phoebe that she could stay with her during the 6 month period, pushes her off on a RICH artist, who conveniently falls in love with her. Why?  Because he falls in love with everybody.  By the way, what was Phoebe going to do without this friend?  Everything certainly was convenient for this unwed mom.  Phoebe never even needed any money, and everyone ran to her rescue, including of course the also very WEALTHY adoptive parents.  Well, we wouldn't want anything less but for dear Phoebe to have it easy.<br />One other thing, the gifted Phoebe fails to consider by not telling her impregnator that he has a child: what if he has another child one day, who grows up, meets and marries her half-sibling?  It HAS happened.  You need to take these things into consideration, gifted Phoebe.<br />Phoebe is immature, self-centered, and unlikable.  The writing was very poor, jumped all over the place from fantasy to reality (perhaps) and overall, very unconvincing. Can't recommend it for anything but the garbage. Some squirrels might like to tear it up.be never even needed any money, and everyone ran to her rescue, including of course the also very WEALTHY adoptive parents.

The book goes into as much detail as possible, although as usual I wish that there were more about Susan's childhood - was she really molested by her father? Was she abused in other ways? Probably.  I don't see HOW Susan managed to get away with what she did to her defenseless step-son - or how the father of that child can live with himself.  Susan obviously could live with her herself quite well, going on to marry for money - and commit murder for money. She's ruined so many lives, and has no remorse.	2004-06-11
US	21971218	RMU3NQBLINEMB	0684186691	217194933	Poisoned Blood	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	One of My Favorites	I have re-read this book so many times it fell apart.  Great writing, can't put it down type book.  If you are interested in sociopaths, this is one of the best studies of one - although Audrey Marie Hilley refused any psychiatric evaluation - she did show many of the characteristics: lying, greed, using people for her own ends, as well as doing things that just didn't make any sense at all.  Probably a borderline personality disorder as well, as she liked to cheat on her husband, set fires for insurance money, job hop, tell tall tales for attention, kite checks, etc.  Killing her husband, and trying to kill her own daughter, perhaps her mother, mother-in-law, son and daughter-in-law, there was something in her that wanted to control everyone around her, and benefit from it as well.<br /><br />Ginsburg leaves out a lot that is in &#34;Black Widow&#34; by Robin McDonald. He makes it sound as though there was no reason for Marie to set fires, cut wires, and claim intruders in the house, and that there was just something in Marie that caused these mysterious actions. In &#34;Black Widow&#34; it's clear that Marie did these for at least two reasons: insurance money, and to set up a story that someone was after Carol and wanted to kill her. He leaves out the phone call from the phone booth across the street, he leaves out the foster child, and I'm sure, changes a lot of names (to protect the guilty).<br /><br />If only Carol had left home at age 18, after she graduated, instead of staying home with Marie, or going wherever Marie moved, Marie could not have poisoned her (or at least not as much as she did). Marie stated to several people how fed up with Carol she was, and how lazy Carol was.<br /><br />What happened to Marie's crazy, uncontrollable spending once she went to New Hampshire? There is no mention of it. No hint of gambling either. How did she suddenly just stop what to her was ingrained behavior? That she had blown through more than $30,000 insurance money, plus her yearly salaries, plus the sale of her house and the monthly Social Security check for Carol? Yet with both her and John working in New Hampshire, they rented a cramped one-bedroom cottage, and had only John's old truck. As many cars as Marie had had in her life, she now did not want to drive (blamed on her fake story of the auto accident that killed her children). Surely with both of them working they could have afforded a better lifestyle.  Or was Marie suddenly strangely capable to begin frugally saving her money for her trips to Texas and Florida? What DID they spend their money on?<br /><br />How did Marie go from wanting to be at the top of the social heap, to living in a messy little cabin with a rather unkempt, greasy-haired man?<br /><br />Marie claimed her grandfather had molested her as a child. Her father's father died when he was four months old, so she could not have been talking about him. Her mother's father is only mentioned when he refutes the story of a twin dying at birth. And that's it. Marie stayed a lot with these grandparents as a child, yet only her grandmother is mentioned. None of her many relatives say anything about her grandfather.<br /><br />Why did John take her to the loony bin in Boston? What did he expect the doctors there to do? Just because she was &#34;having spells&#34; where she behaved as a one year old (only at night, of course). Did she have insurance through her job and were any claims ever filed for doctor visits for her supposed blood disease (it used to be a brain tumor, but she changed it - John didn't notice this either). Did she ever actually go to a doctor, for anything? What happened to those records?<br /><br />After Marie as Robbi changed her identity to Teri, saying Robbi had died, she shows back up in NH and very stupidly goes to her old job, to &#34;remember&#34; Robbi to her co-workers. As Teri, she wears Robbi's coat and carries Robbi's purse!! What woman is not going to notice that! At least part yourhair on right side instead of the left, Marie! No doubt she got off the plane as Teri, carrying Robbi's suitcase and wearing Robbi's clothes - but John didn't notice! When supposedly both Robbi and Teri were rich. She should have at least bought a new purse and coat and smoked a different brand of cigarettes. In &#34;Black Widow&#34; it said that Marie did not smoke or drink or approve of anyone who did. How does a forty-something woman suddenly take up smoking?<br /><br />Did John know that Teri was Robbi? Of course he did. Was he the boyfriend from Florida who sent her money via Western Union after she had been arrested for attempting to murder Carol? I think so. I think they met when she had first gone to Florida after Carol's graduation to visit Mike and his wife (Teri). According to Mike, she was either working late or going out lots of nights, supposedly to an extra bookkeeping job. I think that is when she met John (doing something other than bookkeeping).<br /><br />Wouldn't John, if he had any common sense, have questioned what happened to Robbi's fabulous inheritance (which was taking years to collect) after her death? Ask about a will? Ask Teri what was going to happen to all the money and property that Robbi supposedly owned, since Teri was taking charge of Robbi's business affairs?<br /><br />Also, according to this author when she was taken, as Teri, to the station in Vermont, and John came to pick her up, he referred to Teri TWICE as his wife. In this book, he apparently told a friend that they were sleeping together. In &#34;Black Widow&#34; he denied that he was intimate with Teri.<br /><br />Why did Marie go with the troopers in Vermont? They clearly told her she did not have to go with them and she did not have to talk to them. But she did, and they found out who she was and shipped her back to Alabama to face trial. Marie could have just told them no, and if she was worried, she could have just quit that job and found another.<br /><br />Once she was in prison, if only she had been patient enough to wait another three or so years, she probably would have gotten out on parole. Even if she wasn't that patient, couldn't she have waited just a couple more months for warmer weather to make her escape? But Marie just couldn't wait. What she wanted, she wanted now, and was arrogant enough to think she would succeed, even lying about her name up to the end (she said it was Sellers, which was the name of her mother's doctor), despite being disoriented from hypothermia.<br /><br />If you like this book, I would recommend that you also read &#34;Black Widow&#34; as it fills in a lot of the blanks in this book, and the author even interviews Marie and  Carol. This book does however include Marie's time as a fugitive in New Hampshire, Texas and Florida, as well as John Homan's upbringing.hair on right side instead of the left, Marie!

Marie could have just told them no, and if she was worried, she could have just quit that job and found another.<br /><br />Once she was in prison, if only she had been patient enough to wait another three or so years, she probably would have gotten out on parole. Even if she wasn't that patient, couldn't she have waited just a couple more months for warmer weather to make her escape? But Marie just couldn't wait. What she wanted, she wanted now, and was arrogant enough to think she would succeed, even lying about her name up to the end (she said it was Sellers, which was the name of her mother's doctor), despite being disoriented from hypothermia.<br /><br />If you like this book, I would recommend that you also read &#34;Black Widow&#34; as it fills in a lot of the blanks in this book, and the author even interviews Marie and  Carol. This book does however include Marie's time as a fugitive in New Hampshire, Texas and Florida, as well as John Homan's upbringing.	2004-06-08

Kent Walker tells the story of his upbringing by a psychopathic monster.  Sometimes his story is inconsistent, even hypocritical.  Mr. Walker states he is sure that his mother loves him and would do anything for him - she sometimes threw him huge birthday bashes, threatened to have a boy who beat him up expelled from school (although never followed through) and intervened by schmoozing with Army big wigs to have him accepted into Flight School - although six months later she demanded that he leave his dream to come to her \\"rescue\\" (she was arrested for enslaving maids).<br /><br />Mr. Walker also claims that his mother is \\"hot-blooded\\", not cold-blooded - although she punched him in the mouth when he was eight years old (requiring stitches and leaving a numbness that never went away) because Sante had been caught shoplifting.  She blamed the assault on the store manager who caught her and had the audacity to demand her merchandise back.  The police for some reason bought Sante's story and arrested the innocent woman, while Sante went on her merry way with her stolen merchandise.<br /><br />In the habit of burning down houses for insurance money, Sante sent her young son back into a house for a folder she \\"forgot\\" - the explosion came as he was coming down the steps with the requested item.  Sante also beat him with wire hangers, tried to destroy the relationship between Mr. Walker and his girlfriend (later wife), poisoned his wife, and endangered his child.  However, Mr. Walker continued his relationship with his mom.<br /><br />Mr. Walker states that his mother was great 95% of the time; it was only one day a month that things were horrible - however, every day, she and his step-father drank and had heated arguments.  Sante enslaved, physically, mentally and verbally abused illegal aliens, stealing their passports and identification.  Mr. Walker even helped a few of them escape, but he really didn't think she was that bad, although the trial later proved he must have been in la-la land.  Sante stole her own best friend's wallet while she visited.  Sante Kimes ruined both close friends' and stranger's lives and reputations, destroying their credit and sending innocent people to jail.  She is a liar, thief, con artist, and multiple murderer - yet Mr. Walker felt compelled to laugh when she verbally abused an overworked waitress.  He belittles others (his father, his step-father) for enduring her abuse and manipulations for so long - but it seems that Mr. Walker endured it for the longest - for these admitted reasons: love and greed.  His stepfather was a millionaire and backed him in business.  However his stepfather was also a thief, and an admitted murderer (Sante's accomplice).  He wouldn't \\"give\\" Sante a checking account - so she continued to shoplift, run scams (he participated), manipulate her son's life, and alienate her husband from all of his relatives.  Sante insisted that they were trying to kill her and kidnap Kenny, the \\"heir\\".  After Ken Kimes died (was he poisoned by Kenny and Sante?) first Mr. Walker tells us there WAS money in the stepfather's accounts, found out there was NO money, then towards then end, there is money in the accounts - which Mr. Walker believes he is entitled to.  Did he ever pay back all those loans or the money he stole out of Mr. Kimes pants' pockets?<br /><br />First, Mr. Walker lays the blame for how Kenny turned out squarely on Kenny's dad - as Sante was in prison when Kenny was 10 - 13 years old, and \\"according to shrinks\\" that is when a child's moral code is formed.  Later when Kenny is actually committing crimes (murder etc.) with his mother, it's his mother who is to blame for Kenny's actions - he is being manipulated!  And even though Mr. Walker tried numerous times to get Kenny to leave his mother, and start his own life, even offering him a job, Kenny refused saying he enjoyed the lifestyle and luxury comforts the scams gave them.  Kenny made fun of Mr. Walker's \\"holier than thou\\" attitude, and told him he should join them.  Suddenly, when Kenny was in prison, it was all Mr. Walker's fault that Kenny ended up there.  Mr. Walker was the one guilty for his brother turning out the way he did.  He said it was all his fault, and he should have tried harder!<br /><br />One discrepancy that bugged me was Mr. Walker's description of the dress his mother wore to several parties one certain night in D.C.  He describes it as white \\"fringe\\" over her d&eacute;colletage.  However, the picture clearly shows a white dress with a high ruffled neck, ruffled bodice, and long, leg-of-mutton sleeves - sort of a Little House on the Prairie in White look.  If Mr. Walker can't see this dress for what it is, what else is he not seeing clearly?<br /><br />There is not enough in the book about Sante's background, because apparently he either didn't try to get interviews with relatives, or they refused.  Mr. Walker doesn't really know what the truth of Sante's childhood is, but something pretty bad had to have happened in order for her to become what she did.  But what?  Since Sante is nothing but a liar or until somebody reliable from her past talks, I guess we'll never know.<br />Mr. Walker believes the sentences are too harsh for the crimes committed by his brother and mother.  After at least four murders and countless other ruined lives, including both of her sons, it appears that Sante and Kenny got off easy.<br /><br />After reading this book, one can tell that Mr. Walker still has issues that need to be addressed.  If you are interested in the study of psychopaths, I suggest \\"Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us,\\" by Robert D. Hare. Sante fits right in with the rest of them, especially her reasoning, or lack thereof.ny made fun of Mr. Walker's \\"holier than thou\\" attitude, and told him he should join them.

A good and realistic story of teens who have babies because they don't know any better, think it's the thing to do, or so that they will have someone to \\"love\\" them.  Once the girls have the babies, of course, it's a different story...it's also the story of two adult women who pine for relationships that no longer exist as they once did, and how difficult it is for them to wake up and smell the coffee.  Hindsight is 20/20 we all know after being through what we've been through.  Joyce Maynard is an extremely capable and gifted writer who can pull you into a character's life with real-life details - the long monkey toes of Sunshine, Wanda's sad acknowledgement that \\"she will never have a rear end like that again\\", Jill's \\"turtle-necked\\" prom gown remark, and Sandy's tears of despair when no one shows up for her son's five month birthday party.  Although I must say, Wayne was a character I just didn't get - what was the motivation there?<br /><br />Also, there were some inaccuracies: Mrs. Ramsey's hydatidiform mole pregnancy which she said was \\"like Mary and Jesus\\" meaning there was no intercourse - cannot happen without conception. A Hoosier cabinet is not likely to have the flour sifter in the bottom door. That would be inconvenient. And who would ever decide to shoot tiny bats in a house with a .22 rifle? You would miss most of them, meanwhile putting a lot of holes in the house.	2004-06-04

I remember when this happened, because I live in Texas and it was in the newspaper.  I have re-read the book many times, hoping to finally understand things from Candy's point of view, such as it is....This book is well-written and spell-binding.  I don't feel that the authors were &#34;sympathetic&#34; to Candy; they seemed quite objective to me. There was no need to be sympathetic anyway, she did what she did, and she was very lucky she got the jury that she did.<br /><br />I do wish very much that this book had photographs. In the book, Candy says when she first meets Pat, he isn't handsome but she has dated worse...and Pat says Candy has a double chin and pointy nose. I've seen photos and Pat is correct...and Pat is better-looking than Candy deserves. They married October 6, 1970, when Candy was almost twenty-one years old.  Betty was also much cuter than Candy.  And I wish that I knew what happened to everyone in the book years later.  I read somewhere a long time ago that Pat and Candy had moved to Georgia and had separated.  And that the Gore children (grown now)still resent Candy, needless to say. I just wonder how Candy thinks about the killing in her own mind, every day....It probably doesn't bother her much since she simply went about her business afterward and had no plans to reveal what happened. Stating to the prosecutor in her testimony: &#34;I did not hold off because of the prints.&#34;  (True meaning - she DID hold off until they found her print and could connect her to the crime - otherwise she was going to pretend until she died that she was Miss Innocent - even telling Betty's grieving mother, &#34;I just wish there was something I could do for you.&#34;)<br /><br />I would like to know what happened to the towels Candy said she used to wipe up the blood in the laundry room. She stopped because she said &#34;this is silly...there's too much blood&#34;....but neither the neighbors nor the investigators mentioned anything about finding bloody bath towels. Maybe she took them home with her in her station wagon and washed them and kept them? Betty had already given her a towel for Alisa's swimming lesson which she said she stuffed in her purse. What kind of purse did this woman have that was large enough to hold a bath towel?<br /><br />Also, what was the deal with Candy's sunglass lens being found OUTSIDE the laundry room in a CLOSET in the garage? She claimed she never went out there. That evidence was just blown off.<br /><br />Update - Candy lives in Atlanta, Georgia and goes by Candace Wheeler. She is a MS, LPC (Licensed Professional Counselor) specializing in marriage counseling.  She probably thinks she's an expert since she was bored in her marriage and had an affair - I bet she doesn't tell her clients, &#34;By the way, I killed the wife of the man I was having my affair with - with an axe.  And I left her little baby in her house alone screaming her lungs out, sitting in a dirty diaper for 12 hours or so.  I just went on about my business as if I hadn't done anything, didn't know anything about it...don't you trust my advice now?&#34; Candace Wheeler has got some nerve, but then, she always did.<br /><br />Bethany and Alisa's maternal grandparents got custody of them after Allen and Elaine began abusing them. According to Alisa, Elaine withholding food was one of the punishments inflicted on Alisa. Allen and Elaine later divorced.  Allen sent one of the girls a card once (signing it with only his first name), but he never called or visited them, probably scared of their grandfather who threatened him after Elaine started pulling out Bethany's hair. Alisa is married with a little boy and Bethany is in college.  They both feel that Candy did not tell the whole story.  Don Crowder committed suicide in his den, narrowly missing his third wife with a test shot through the door.  She said he didn't feel needed any more by his kids.<br /><br />Reverend Jackie Ponder passed away January 21, 2014 per North Texas United Methodist Church Organization website death announcements.

By the ending, though, I was completely let-down, and I will not be keeping this book to re-read.  After showing her strength through all the hard times, Madeleine seems to become wishy washy and a complete doofus.  The ending seems tacked-on and ridiculous, and I don't buy it.  Is the author trying to say that Madeleine becomes her mother in the end?  I think this could have been a much better book with a lot more to offer the readers, if Madeleine had kept her strength and faced reality.	2004-05-19

My copy was printed in 1970 and apparently had never been touched since, since I found a insert for an advertisement by Rod Serling to send off for a correspondence course with a writing school.<br /><br />I did read The Best of Everything by Rona Jaffe and loved it and have re-read it many times.  This book was a huge disappointment in comparison.  It was as though she was trying to copy Jackie Susann, almost paraphrasing her at times.  And it just did not work.<br /><br />All the characters were shallow, not credible, and for the most part extremely unlikeable.  For instance, Gerri was supposed to be so strong and sure of herself, yet she falls madly in love with a cold, distant jerk who really wants to be with boys, and then becomes engaged to a still-married child-molesting moron.  What's so great about these guys is never explained.  She's 26, and has 5 years of publicity work in Rome and Paris.  Later, it only mentions 2 years (twice).  So which is it?  Also, Gerri's job as Girl Friday lasts 12 hours a day, however she does get a 2 hour lunch break and 2 hour dinner break - that would make it an 8 hour day, right?  Her important tasks include mailing out Christmas cards and calling clients with updated schedules.  This is why I can't figure out the ending - it makes no sense at all.<br /><br />The theme throughout is women with low self-esteem falling in love with undeserving, uninteresting men whom the women are dying to marry.  A couple of the women note that it is the man who would have everything to lose and have to give up so much by marrying.  Yeah, such as what?<br /><br />I tried, but just couldn't find any redeeming qualities in this book.  Overall very depressing and a waste of time.	2004-05-17

It's very difficult to have any sympathy or respect for Michelle Ghetti, Battaglia's first wife.  The author characterizes her as &quot;brilliant&quot; which I find offensive.  She dates a man who shows off his violent temper towards strangers.  She is delighted to become pregnant by him, even though she is &quot;diligently&quot; taking the pill.  She marries him because her mother tells her to.  She is then further surprised to find out (when he leaves her for a couple of days) that all while seeing her, he's been dating an old girlfriend and promised to leave his wife and take his child and raise the child with the girlfriend.  Apparently Michelle failed to notice these absences while they were dating, and it was a surprise to her, but his infidelity didn't bother her enough to leave him. She continues to stay married to him, even though he abuses her son from her first marriage, and hits her and knocks her down while she's holding his baby daughter.  Yes, this is quite a brilliant woman.  Even though she is an attorney and makes &quot;great money&quot; she does not do what she should have done long before - pick up and move back to LA to her &quot;supportive&quot; family - until he beats the crap out of her in public.  Somehow, the brilliant attorney was outsmarted at every turn - if she even tried, which it appears she did not.  She could have moved out of the house they rented (since he kept getting locksmiths to give him the new keys to the locks she changed repeatedly) and moved into a gated community.  But no. She didn't want an unlisted number either.<br />His second wife, Mary Jean, knows full well that he abused his first wife, because he told her.  She happily marries him anyway, since this was an isolated incident after all, and produces two little girls.  She gets sick of his verbal abuse and kicks him out.  She has a protective order against him, however she lets him in her house on Christmas day, because she's afraid if she doesn't, he'll pitch a fit.  He proceeds to pummel her black and blue in front of their two kids and Laurie, his daughter by Michelle. Guess Mary Jean didn't take the protective order very seriously, so why should Battaglia?  The fatal night, she makes the kids go on their visitation, even though they don't want to, and he's about to be arrested the next day, and he's 25 minutes late anyway. No, they must go.<br />This book made me sick.  And I've worked in a women's shelter.  The vast majority of the women there are very poor and uneducated. They do not work. They have low self-esteem.  They are dependent on the abuser. They literally have no where else to go.  Family will not take them in because they are afraid or because they know that the woman will simply go back the abuser, so why bother risking involvement?
