Light reading that provides some insight into the mind of a major league ball player.  Damon is no Harvard graduate, but her perspective on the game brings superstardom down to earth.  It seems big leaguers are just regular guys good at playing ball.  They don't seem to know what to do with most of the attention they attract off field except complain about it or grin and bear it.  Not really the nuts and bolts, fly on the wall narrative I was expecting from a World Series Champ, but still an interesting read.	2005-04-30

Conseco names names and provides a minimum number of facts to back up his claims.  Unfortunately, for some of the folks he named, Conseco's observations about their miraculous bulking up make a reader wonder.<br /><br />Though he back off his whole-hearted embrace of steroids at the Congressional hearings, Conseco clearly struck a nerve and it was clear as day that Mark McGuire* was guilty, guilty, guilty, while a couple of others probably perjured themselves.<br /><br />In addition to steroids, Conseco goes into a lot of detail about the media conspiracy against him.  Though he claims he suffered no ill-effects of steroids, isn't paranoia one of the symptoms?	2005-04-02

Much of the book detailed the author's voyage down the river.  Having bought this book at the Grand Canyon I can say with authority that the photos in no way capture the beauty and magnificence of the Canyon.  While there I couldn't stop staring into it and walking around to various views.  The light of the day changes everything and gives a whole new perspective.  Looking down into the canyon calls you to explore.  One day I'm hiking down there.<br /><br />There is much more mystery and intrigue to the Grand Canyon than is contained in this book.  Overall, just OK.	2005-03-29

In this episode Susannah/Mia is tasked to deliver her baby and we find the child will become the Crimson King and is Roland's son.  Its a little confusing, but that's the deal.  This tome is shorter and painted with as broad stripes as WOLVES OF THE CALLA.  King has written himself into the narrative as the writer/god of all that is occurring.  Everything seems to flow from him and he is paid a visit by Eddie and Roland.  This aspect, a writer putting himself in the narrative, is usually my most hated device, but I actually enjoyed King's involvement in the story and I expect him to take a role in #7 which I have just dived into.	2005-02-07

A high profile DC lawyer sent to prison after his arrest for attempting to broker a deal involving a stolen satellite system.  Suddenly, and inexplicably pardoned after six years of a 20 year sentence, by a clueless President at the behest of the crooked CIA Director, Backman is left wondering why?<br /><br />Spirited off to Italy so he can start his new life and be set up to get killed by the countries offended in the never completed satellite deal, Backman slowly comes to realize he is in real danger.  Dodging and weaving the CIA and foreign intelligent officers in typical Grisham fashion takes up the bulk of this short novel.  All the tension is derived from avoiding scrutiny.<br /><br />A fast read, this THE BROKER is not as complex as early Grisham works.  Recommended reading with a rare happy ending.	2005-01-24

Not because Roland, Jake, Eddie, and Susannah return, but more in spite of it.  The stand-out character in this edition is Father Callahan, the priest from SALEM'S LOT.  His story following the demise of the Lot is memorizing and the most interesting part of WOLVES.  Dealing with the remnants of type 3 vampires and the Low Men from HEART OF ATLANTIS kind of ran off with the story.<br /><br />Here, Roland and company make like the Magnificent 7, rolling into Calla Bryn Sturgis, a farm town plagued every 19 years or so by the Wolves.  Doctor Doom look-a-likes who take one of every pair of twin children, for some fiendish purpose.  The stories of Roland, Jake, Eddie and Susannah have grown stale in Roland's quest for the Dark Tower.  Perhaps killing off the ka-tet would have been most merciful for the reader.  Each book should start with Roland meeting and employing new characters to get killed off in his quest.<br /><br />SK has pushed the made-up language of Roland's earth to the limit.  If I read \\"Thankee, sai\\" or \\"commala\\" or \\"ken\\" one more time I'm going to scream.  I don't understand what those annoying tag-lines add to the story.  Also annoying is the turn of SK injecting himself into the story.  You've got to be kidding me.<br /><br />This book could stand a good editing out of about 200 pages.  That done it would be flawless.  Now that Susannah has come up pregnant with the demon seed and fled to give birth I have to read what happens next.  I hope the next two books are tighter than this one, but WOLVES is well worth a read.	2005-01-14

Mark Miller of the State Department is dispatched to locate her and rescue her.  Meanwhile, Michener takes the opportunity to guide us through the Afghan culture.  Topics include crime and punishment; debauchery; irrigation; brutality; untamed land; the low status of women; dessert dangers; lack of medicine; and Genghis Kahn.<br /><br />About half way through the book, Miller finds the girl, Ellen Jaspar, who is not so much lost as she is aimless, traveling with a tribe of nomads.  A selfish girl, bored with her life in middle America, she impulsively married an Afghan student and moved with him back to Afghanistan.  Growing bored with him she joined the nomads who wander as aimlessly as she.<br /><br />Written in the 1960's it's clear Ellen was to represent the wayward youth of that era, caught up in the quest for freedom; getting back to basics; and rejecting any kind of modernization to a region stuck in the stone age.  Ellen is willing to spread her legs for anyone she thinks can benefit her.  Ultimately, Ellen is ejected from Afghanistan, unable to stop the progress her \\"free\\" Afghanis crave.<br /><br />By Michener standards, this is a short book.  Clearly one of his early works before cramming encyclopedias of knowledge into each tomb.  Worth a read to gain some insight into the Afghan psyche.	2004-12-31

This is a very compelling read.  John Corey, the ex-NYPD detective, and FBI Anti-Terrorism Task Force member, hero of DeMille's PLUM ISLAND and LION'S GAME is back to investigate the mysterious crash of Flight 800 off the coast of NYC in 1996.  The story takes place shortly before the events of 9/11 so there is a lot of talk about terrorism prior to that event (USS Cole and Tanzania).<br /><br />Prompted by his wife, FBI Special Agent Kate Mayfield, Corey begins digging into the mysterious streak of light seen by over 200 witnesses rocketing toward the unfortunate 747.  Told by his supervisors at the FBI ATTF in no uncertain terms to back off, Corey plows forward with his usual cynicism and humor until he gets to the bottom of the mystery.<br /><br />I couldn't take my eyes off this book.  It is so well put together it keeps you reading and wanting more.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, humorous, mystery.  You don't have to have read the other novels to enjoy this one, but it may make you want to go back and pick up the previous books.<br /><br />Great entertainment.	2004-12-23

O'Nan's antics and observations were hysterical.  Taking a fishing net to the games to catch fly balls; yelling at players; and the Ortiz shirt that said, \\"Its not hot sauce, its not barbeque sauce, its Boston Red sauce!\\"  Awesome.  Just a wonderful snapshot of sports history in the making.<br /><br />Only detractor was Stephen King inserting his politics into the narrative.  Who wants to read that?  You watch baseball to forget about your worries, not be reminded of them.  Didn't catch SK's thoughts on the great Curt Schilling being a Bush supporter. That must have been a tough pill to swallow.<br /><br />Great job Red Sox!  Great job Stewart and Stephen.  What a great book.

What attracted me was that one story after another told of violence during the early days of Nebraska's history.  Generally, historical books do not dwell on violence unless there is some historical significance.  None of these are.<br /><br />Here, Wayne Lee, provides one murder after another.  Either its Indians, frontiersmen, pioneers, or just plain crooks.  Each story reads like a brief newspaper article.<br /><br />My chief complaint with this book is the lack of detail surrounding circumstances and followup.  I would have liked a bit more back-story on each blurb.  No story lasts more than about two pages.<br /><br />The photographs in the book are fascinating, but even they provide little information as to year and location of the photo.  I can only recommend this for a look.<br /><br />NOT required reading for those interested in Nebraska's history.	2004-11-30

I picked this book up after reading about it in People magazine and in the local newspaper book review.  This book explains the nuts and bolts of hyping movies and mega-box office returns.<br /><br />It was interesting to learn that focus groups and test audiences have a lot to do with what ends up on the final silver screen.  The process of movie by committee seems to take a lot of the creative air out of a movie's sails.<br /><br />Stars and trailer placement generate a lot of return later.  Extremely informative and insightful with every page.  I learned a lot about the motion picture industry that does not usually make it into the news.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the panic that goes on behind the scenes when the suits get an inkling that their film isn't going to do well.  Movie buffs interested in the marketing will find this very interesting reading.	2004-11-29

The only question is who killed him?  Rayford Steele or someone else?  The authors tried so hard to persuade us it was Rayford, we were left to conclude it couldn't have been him.  Here we learn we were right, it wasn't Rayford.  Surprisingly, it was Chiam Rosenzweig.  Yeah, the guy in the wheelchair.  Apparently he was pretending, just to get himself in a position to kill Nicholae.<br /><br />But guess again, Nicholae isn't really dead!  Some real suspense was built throughout this installment to lay the foundation for Nicholae's miraculous resurrection.  Three days later, Nicholae rises during his own funeral and demands to be worshiped as a god.  In actuality he has been indwelt by Satan himself, though that was not clearly spelled out.<br /><br />I will move onto THE MARK.

Once at his new school he is immediately the target of bullying by a punk named Dana.  Hoot refers to a species of pigmy owls who live in the ground in a lot that is destined to become a pancake house.  While being bullied on the bus by Dana, Roy sees a barefoot wild-boy who does not go to school.  Roy ends up befriending the boy and his gawky sister, who are sabotaging the pancake house work-site in an effort to save the owls.<br /><br />Though there is some commendable problem solving on the part of Roy from the perspective of a 12 year old, the reader can't shake the feeling that there is a 50 year old man in his head pulling the strings.  Roy always seems to have an answer and know exactly what to do, with a confidence you don't see in kids that age.<br /><br />Hoot is really an environmentalist story, instructing children on how to slow progress and defeat evil corporations.  How nice.  I was a little disappointed how many of the story-lines; bullying and child abuse, were swept conveniently aside to make way for the saving of the owls.<br /><br />Not immediately apparent is that this book is a Newberry Award winner.  It's intended for children.  Hiaasen usually writes adult crime fiction.<br /><br />Worth a look, but really nothing all that special.	2004-10-30

As the title implies, there are several assassins here.  Carpathia guns down the Jerusalem Twosome witnesses on their prophesied last day.  Lying dead for three days while celebrants dance around their bodies, the two begin to stir and rise to Heaven.<br /><br />Surprisingly, two diametrically opposed characters, Rayford Steele and Hattie Durham, decide independently and separately to kill Carpathia.  In the closing pages, during the culmination of the celebration in Jerusalem Carpathia is shot in the head and is clearly dead.<br /><br />Unclear, is who is responsible; Rayford, Hattie, or one of the ten under-potentates on the stage with Carpathia.  Though the authors go out of their way to makes us think it's Rayford, I'm not so sure.  And it probably doesn't matter--Carpathia, though dead here is destined to return in INDWELLING.	2004-10-15

Personally I thought the first half was dull and I didn't understand why Beck thought it was so great.  A bunch of beautiful, trained assassins were killing diplomats or their families at the direction of Snay Bin Wazir, aka \\"The Dog.\\"<br /><br />Wazir is a fat Islamic pig working for \\"The Emir\\".  Wazir hates America and plans to unleash Smallpox on the 100 most populated cities.  The book opens with the unrelated murder of Alexander Hawkes bride.  This doesn't even rate Hawke's personal attention.  He sends Stokely, his best friend to take care of that vendetta.<br /><br />Anayway, Hawke is a new James Bond, 007.  Rarely involved in the action, Hawke saves the day by shooting down a plane-load of Smallpox infected women over the Pacific ocean.<br /><br />This book reminds me of a Dirk Pitt novel, but with a more contemporary plot-line.  It got significantly more interesting in the second half, but suffers in the plot department.  Very colorful characters make for a comicbook-like read.	2004-10-12

John Kerry urged the US to surrender and pull out of Vietnam, basing charges of atrocities on lies while still a member of the Naval Reserve.  How can a man more interested in self-promotion than the well-being of his own country expect to become Commander in Chief following 30 years of slander of fellow veterans as war criminals?<br /><br />This represents just one of many charges raised by the Swiftboat Veterans against John Kerry in this thoroughly researched book.  These are questions that deserve answers.  While the left-leaning media and the likes of Dan Rather scream for President Bush's National Guard records, John Kerry refuses to disclose his own records.  Why does John Kerry get a pass?<br /><br />It's sad that the media ignores 180 of 200 Swiftees who say Kerry is UNFIT FOR COMMAND, while beating their Bush-hating drums.  Swiftboat Veterans simply want some accountability.  Kerry admitted before a 1971 Congressional panel that he observed and participated in war crimes.  He went on to accuse all servicemen of similar war crimes--without a lick of proof and backed by impostors; men who either did not hold the ranks they pretended; never served in Vietnam; or were not in the military to begin with.<br /><br />John Kerry is willing to lie and do whatever else it takes to become President.  The American people should be concerned.  Fortunately John O'Neill had the nerve and courage to blow the whistle.  Why doesn't CBS and Dan Rather go after the real story instead of inventing it on a word processor to smear the President?<br /><br />This book is a must read.  Also check out Robert \\"Buzz\\" Patterson's, RECKLESS DISREGARD.  An equally well-researched book about Kerry and Clinton.	2004-10-05

BL goes to the well again with book four.<br /><br />This time, Harry Keogh has lost his ability to use the Mobius continuum.  Faethor Ferenczy's other son, Janos has arisen to give Harry grief.  It's the same Wamphyri story all over again.  It even reads as though Lumley is tired of the formula.<br /><br />With so much going for the series, its difficult to understand why BL doesn't break new ground with Keogh and the E-Branch.  There are so many directions he could go that have nothing to do with vampires.  With everything Ferenczy, the series has become too incestuous to continue reading.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one.  This is the low point in the series.	2004-09-15

Though a daunting 428 pages of text and an additional 140 pages of footnotes, the report reads like a well-researched novel.  The first 40 pages give a minute by minute description of what happened on and to each of the four hijacked jets.  Some of the details are so intense and disturbing the reader may not want to know.  There was more to the hijackings than was ever reported in the mainstream media.  The report shatters many misconceptions and sets the record straight.<br /><br />One of the most commendable things about the report is how nonpartisan and fair it seems to be.  Reading the report makes a citizen proud of the American government, as it demonstrates what can be accomplished when our elected officials set their minds to a task.<br /><br />The commission asks and answers the question echoing through the minds of most Americans: \\"Why do they hate us?\\" and \\"What can we do to stop them?\\"  Al Qaeda feels Islam is attacked by America in every situation from Iraq to Israel.  To the second question, al Qaeda feels America should abandon the Middle East and convert to Islam.  It's as simple and unreasonable as that.  America is the worst civilization that has ever existed in the history of mankind, as far as they are concerned.<br /><br />This book lays it all out in finite detail and is a must read for any American who wishes to be informed of the FACTS.  It's better than any novel you will ever pick up, because its true.  Chilling stuff.	2004-09-06

Only the portal leads to the origin planet of the Wamphyri!<br /><br />Jazz Simmons, a British agent is sent--unsuspectingly--to the Perchorsk Project.  He learns of a Wamphyri warrior who made it through the portal to the Russian side, where he was immediately burned to cinders in a violent demise.  Jazz, the Soviet's enemy, soon finds himself \\"volunteered\\" to go through the portal as a Guinea Pig.  Prior to being forced through, he learns that others have been banished there ahead of him and there has been no communication from them.<br /><br />Within, Jazz meets the Travelers, humans constantly on the run from the Wamphyri, who feed on them like cattle.  Jazz soon meets up with another esper, Zek Foener, shoved through the portal about a month prior to Jazz.  Sparks fly, but the problem is, they learn they cannot return through the same way the came it.  Big problem.<br /><br />Enter Harry Keogh, who is still seeking his missing wife and son.  Harry has learned to better control the Mobius continuum and looks for a way out for his friends.<br /><br />Some real frights in this episode, but Lumley spends too much time on the history and sociology of the Wamphyri and not enough on the truly interesting Perchorsk Project side where the real terror builds.  Though billed as the third in a trilogy, this book easily stands alone and could be read without the first two books preceding it.  Excellent horror book.  Almost perfect.	2004-09-06

So why doesn't he just crash the plan at his first opportunity?  I guess he's not willing to give his life for his beliefs.<br /><br />The interpersonal relationships are the most interesting in this volume.

Brian Lumley has a rich and fertile imagination populated by vampires, telepaths, and secret government organizations.<br /><br />In N2: VAMPHYRI, Harry Keogh returns.  Harry talks to dead people.  Anyone he wants to.  It seems the dead are restless and trapped in their singular worlds, like a person locked in a box with no one to pass the time with, they want to talk.<br /><br />The first 80 pages or so of this novel are narrated by Faethor Ferenczy, an age old vampire pinned in his grave.  It's all very dull, and the first time I tried to read this book I gave up after 80 pages of nothing happening.  A few pages later, Faethor explains how Gorgina Budescu falls unconscious following an accident that claims the life of her husband.  In her unconscious state, Faethor takes the opportunity to plan his seed in her womb, on her unborn son, Yulian.  Years pass and Yulian develops into quite a creep.  Unfortunately, he is also a vampire.<br /><br />Brian Lumley is a genius.  He doesn't just build on vampire lore he creates thousands of years of history that reinvents the legend from the seeds of it Rumanian roots.  His creatures live to be over a thousand years old and find their origins well beyond a simple bite to the neck.<br /><br />In N2, vampires are symbiotic creatures, cohabiting inside the bodies of their human hosts, with the result of enhancing both entities.  The protoplasmic creatures give humans longevity, healing abilities, and enhancements in all endeavors.  The host gives the creature mobility and purpose -- a vessel for accomplishment.<br /><br />More interesting to me than the vampire story-line are the ESPers making up British INTESP and Soviet E-Branch.  Teams of telepaths and psychics with various degrees of ability play politics on the fringe of the vampire menace.  The more I read, the more I wanted Lumley to deviate from Bodescu and flesh out Alec Kyle, Carl Quint, and Zek Foener.<br /><br />By the time Yulian is killed near the end of the novel, that story-line was taking a back-seat to the explanation of E-Branch and INTESP and their members.

This time zombie-dom is spawned by Agent X, a mysterious infection that victimizes women before men.  By the time the story gears up, women are in short supply...save Lulu, an underdeveloped seventeen-year-old girl who has not yet \\"bloomed.\\"  Lulu is the narrator of this tale, which she tells with a bit of humor and an attitude that takes nothing very seriously.<br /><br />As Xombies overrun the world, Lulu finds herself literally picked up by her father, Mr. Cowper, a man she had never met before.  They escape together and flee to a departing nuclear submarine on a mysterious mission to a secret destination.<br /><br />In the last days of mankind the struggle for survival becomes a strict game of survival of the fittest.  As the only surviving female, Lulu finds herself in a precarious position.  With overtones of the Beatles in music and allusion--the Xombies are blue and referred to as \\"Blue Meanies\\" -- \\"We all live in a yellow submarine...\\" Lulu and the crew of the sub happen upon a luxury liner frozen in the Arctic ice, inhabited by Fab Four impersonators.  The Beatle references are never explained.<br /><br />Reaching their destination, an Iceland Air Force Base, the survivors find a huge population of Moguls--rich men seeking immortality and safe haven.  Here it is revealed that Agent X was the first step in reaching a state of immortality when it's creator scuttled the project and disappeared.  Cowper stole and hid the antidote to soulless zombie-dom.  Now Lulu is the vessel of salvation.  After being turned into the virgin Xombie, she becomes an un-dead spigot, providing the rationality to an otherwise mindless existence.  (Don't ask, I didn't understand it either.)<br /><br />Though well written, the novel offers no hope and abandons the thrills and chills of the typical Hollywood zombie horror story.  These Xombies are un-killable.  A shot to the head does not offer salvation to normal humans.  By the end, humankind as we know it has disappeared from the face of the earth, as the Xombies sail away in their nuclear submarine.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one folks.

The setting and story-line literally beg to be made frightening by their very virtue.<br /><br />Frank Vaughn kicks off events while out hunting with two buddies, when he shoots a Sasquatch, thinking it an attacking bear.  Understandably, Vaughn does not force his shaken friends to pursue the injured beast and finish it off or make sure it can survive.  Driven by a strong hunter's ethic, Vaughn returns to the forest to do the right thing.  Unfortunately for him, a lid cannot be kept on a story of Bigfoot proportions, especially in a wilderness county of Washington State.  As a result, he is quickly joined by Mackey, a representative from the lumber company that owns the land where the shooting occurred; Dr Lansing, a Bigfoot expert whose career has stalled as a result of his devotion to the mythic creature; and Alison, a Fish & Wildlife officer representing her aunt, a high-ranking official with the Department of the Interior, calling shots from Washington, DC.<br /><br />Kumar wisely departs from the JAWS paradigm, so often copied and so seldom matched, by exploring the consequences of discovering a previously undiscovered bipedal primate roaming the Pacific northwest, given the current use of the Endangered Species Act.  Consequences that could result in virtual economic devastation should the timber industry be shut down by environmentalists in the name of preservation.<br /><br />All of this and the hopes of Lansing hinge on one thing: Killing a Bigfoot to prove to the skeptical world that the creature exists.<br /><br />There is a lot of debate between the characters about these issues and whether environmentalists really know what they are doing when they hijack the law to \\"save\\" and insignificant creature and make thousands of acres unusable.<br /><br />And sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.  If not for the shadowy image of a Sasquatch in the upper right-hand corner, I'd have never picked this novel up.  It is a respectful treatment of the Bigfoot legend.  If it had been given a horror slant, this book would have been out of sight and a bestseller.<br /><br />Bravo.

Well, I didn't know that when I picked this novel up.  Unfortunately, this novel suffers from lack of in depth characterization.  Many characters are colorful, but few have much to do.  For those that were wondering, Stampler is masquerading as a hate-spitting, blind preacher, and killed in the final pages of this mess.<br /><br />The rest of the book is about Martin Vail's pursuit of the Sanctuary, a God and country loving, Montana militia group, who have killed, robbed, and stolen military weaponry.  Vail is approached by the US Attorney General and begged to take on a RICO case against the Sanctuary, as a favor to the President himself.  Unfortunately, presidential politics get in the way and the army is called out to kill them all.<br /><br />It's unclear if Diehl is making an antigovernment statement to protest Ruby Ridge and Waco, or manifest a call to arms against dangerous militias.  In a way, he backs himself into a corner and seems to do a bit of both, but neither well.  When Vail gets warrants to search Sanctuary properties, Diehl gives a taste of how tough it is to be in the government's position sometimes.<br /><br />Interesting characters built up but never utilized to their potential are General Engstrom, President Pennington, and AG Marge Castaigne.  None are essential to the plot as it is written.  But we are sure reminded how great Vail is.	2004-08-14

The first 100 pages deals with McCain's grandfather and father.  Both were admirals in the Navy.  His grandfather fought in both World Wars and his father fought in WW2 through the Vietnam War where he was CINCPAC.  McCain followed the family tradition of the Naval Academy and service as an aviator until he was shot down over Hanoi in 1967.  While McCain was a POW at the notorious Hanoi Hilton, his father was in charge as CINCPAC, which caused him lenient treatment by his captors at the expense of his fellow prisoners.<br /><br />Most remarkable about McCain's story is his self-deprecation, apology, and forgiveness.  He often remarked that other prisoners were tortured more and treated far worse than himself because of his father's admiralty.  (This from a man who endured two broken arms and a broken leg upon ejection from his downed aircraft and then received wholly inadequate medical care.)  He has no reason to apologize, in this reader's estimation.<br /><br />McCain refused early release and endured more torture for refusing to save his father embarrassment and preserve family honor.  Touchingly, it is during McCain's imprisonment that he loved his country the most.  Deprived of all he held dear he was thankful to be an American and all the privilege that entailed.<br /><br />For a man who endured 6 years of torment, it is amazing to me how easily he forgives those who collaborated with the enemy, or misguidedly supported the antiwar movement at his expense.  His forgiveness is not confined to those who were the worst offenders either.  McCain extended his forgiveness to those who abused him earlier in life at the Naval Academy because they resented the station of his father and grandfather.  McCain never named names, and surely spared many alive today the shame they richly earned.<br /><br />John McCain comes off as a genuinely compassionate and thoughtful man.  His words humble the reader in his love of country and sense of duty and honor.<br /><br />The book ends with McCain's release by his captors, leaving the reader wanting to know much more about his career of continuing service to the United States and his attempt to become President.

But with all the evidence against Saddam Hussein, the reader has to give him credit for making a hard decision.<br /><br /> The world changed on 9/11. All the old rules went out the window. Do we really have to wait to be victimized by terrorists on our shores before we are willing to fight back? Even after 9/11, the anti-Bush mob was out protesting the war in Afghanistan, demonstrating on the National Mall, so it is not surprising that we find ourselves in the turmoil of endless debate today.<br /><br /> For over a decade the UN made ineffectual resolution after ineffectual resolution. A body that proposes to keep order in the world cannot continue to draw lines in the sand, then simply step back and draw more lines for the likes of Saddam, without consequences. For all those who think the UN is the answer, I have to scratch my head and ask what the UN has ever done? It has no teeth! The worst thing that could happen would be for someone like Saddam to develop weapons of mass destruction, just so those WMDs could end up in the hands of a terrorist organization. Bush didn't let that happen.<br /><br /> Hussein crossed the line several times. He continuously played cat and mouse with weapons inspectors; he had missiles that could travel 500 km though he was limited to missiles traveling 150 km; he used chemical weapons on the Kurds in the early 90's; he had a habit of &quot;disappearing&quot; his critics and enemies and torturing them to death. For all of those folks who said 50 years ago that the US should have done something about Germany's extermination of the Jews, this is a perfect example of the US getting involved before things got too out of hand.<br /><br /> PLAN OF ATTACK gave a nuts and bolts list of facts leading to the war with Iraq. Unfortunately, people are going to see what they want to see. If they hate Bush, they will be against the war. If they are for Bush they will be for the war. What is John Kerry's plan for fighting terrorism?<br /><br /> The US has not been attacked by terrorists since 9/11. I feel that is because Bush is willing to take the war to the terrorists. Clinton allowed the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; the bombing of Khobar Tower, Saudi Arabia in 1996; the East Africa bombings in 1998; and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. All incidents went unpunished. We were and are at war with terrorists. Just because Bill Clinton chose not to fight back did not mean we were not at war. Bush realizes the US must fight back.<br /><br /> I for one feel that war with Iraq was the right decision. Though there was no smoking gun, the war on terror may always be murky. This was a hell of a read. My one criticism is that Woodward should have taken some sort of stance. He should have tried to prove or disprove something instead of just reporting. This is a thick book. He should know he is allowed to draw conclusions.are for Bush they will be for the war.

After reading his best-selling book on Clinton, DERELICTION OF DUTY, I bought this book on name recognition alone. As career air force and aid in the Clinton White house, Patterson has unparalleled credibility. If that isn't enough for you, check out his extensive bibliography, lest you be tempted to say what he has written is just his opinion.<br />If you are even considering voting for John Kerry in the upcoming Presidential election, you owe it to yourself to read the first half of this book. If you're already behind Bush, you might be interested in reenforcing your commitment.<br />In his thoroughly researched treatise, Patterson gives us some thought-provoking insight into John Kerry: Here's a man who put himself in for 3 purple hearts and a silver star, based on uncorroborated and conflicting accounts of his &quot;action&quot;. Did you know that Kerry only spent 4 months in-country during the Vietnam War, and though he received 3 purple hearts his wounds required nothing more extensive than tweezers and a band-aid? His own men weren't even certain they had been fired upon.<br />Did you now that John Kerry, after taking fire on one occasion, stupidly beached his boat, tracked down and executed a wounded man in clear violation of the Geneva Convention and put himself in for a silver star for his &quot;heroism&quot;? Did you know he returned days later with a super 8 camera and in something unprecedented at the time reenacted the incident? That's where those images in his presidential ads today come from.<br />Did you know that John Kerry exercised a little known loop-hole in the navy that allowed any man with 3 purple hearts to be transferred stateside, and that he recommended to a friend that he find a way to do the same? Did you know that upon returning stateside John Kerry joined the anti-war movement with Jane Fonda to denounce the war?<br />Did you now that John Kerry appeared on multiple occasions with people impersonating returning Vietnam soldiers and testified before Congress about atrocities of rape, murder, and dismemberment as though it were fact, to the detriment of American POWs in Vietnam who then suffered for the fictitious crimes Kerry and his fake soldiers admitted to? Did you now Kerry later admitted that he had never actually been present when these war crimes were committed?<br />Did you know that the medals Kerry supposedly threw on the Capitol steps in 1971 to protest the Vietnam War are now proudly displayed on his office wall? Did you now that on 5/4/04, 19 of 23 former shipmates of John Kerry wrote a letter denouncing Kerry for the blatant lies he told about their service and the conduct of other servicemen in Vietnam?<br />Did you know that John Kerry has consistently voted against increasing military pay, increasing the budget of the military, increasing the budget of intelligence, and proposed cutting their budgets? Did you know he then turned around and accused George Bush of not being prepared for 9/11? After 8 years of Bill Clinton ignoring repeated attacks on the US by terrorists?<br />If that isn't enough, Patterson goes into great detail regarding events leading to 9/11, and why blame should be laid at the feet of Bill Clinton and the liar, Richard Clarke. This is an essential read for anyone who want to understand the why and how of Carter and Clinton not protecting us against terrorism and what John Kerry is likely to do if elected President.occasions with people impersonating returning Vietnam soldiers and testified before Congress about atrocities of rape, murder, and dismemberment as though it were fact, to the detriment of American POWs in Vietnam who then suffered for the fictitious crimes Kerry and his fake soldiers admitted to?

The God Squad is back to (sort of) fight evil in NICOLAE.  Someone else reviewed it better than I ever could when they said there was absolutely no excuse for stretching this story out over 12 novels.  I could solve the problem of Nicolae Carpathia in one easy move.  (See below for my brilliant spoiler.)<br />But first, lets review: Rayford Steele is Carpathia's pilot.  Steele, his useless wife Amanda, his useless daughter Chloe, and his son in law, Buck Williams comprise the Tribulation Force (God Squad).  They are convinced that Nicolae Carpathia is the Antichrist.  That's pretty apparent.  NC has pretty much taking control of the whole world, though the hate machine that is the Middle East is not factored in real well.  I guess if you're Islamic, you don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah, so they were all left behind.<br />Anyway, there is a lot of hand-wringing and praying going on because except for Buck in Israel, rescuing Tsion Ben Judah (the man who broke the news to the world that as a Jew he was now convinced that Jesus was the Messiah); and Steele flying around with Nicolae eavesdropping on his conversations in the back of the plane, there is not a whole lot of action going on that the characters of this book are actually participating in.<br />Though the story is very interesting and I will continue to read the series, here's an idea: If Steele is Nicolae's pilot and Nicolae is the Antichrist, bent on raining death and destruction on everyone on Earth, why doesn't Steele just crash the plane into the ocean, kill Nicolae and save the day?<br />Probably because then LaHaye and Jenkins wouldn't be able to rake in more cash and have Jesus reappear in book 12 to defeat Nicolae.	2004-07-11

Richard Marc Evonitz remains largely a mystery.  Yes, it was proved that he murdered Sophia Silva, and Kristen and Kati Lisk, but inquiries into what made and drove him were largely left to reader speculation.<br />To read this book you would think that Major Howard Smith single-handedly solved these dreadful murders.  Since when does the second in command of a sheriff's office of roughly 100 deputies solve anything?  This signals another problem with the book itself: Not thoroughly researched.  There were a lot of investigators from local, state and federal agencies assigned to the task force investigating the Lisk/Silva murders.  Those that were assigned and worked on aspects of the case every day for six years weren't even mentioned by name.  Major Smith's appearances were limited at best, and did not show a marked improvement until Evonitz became the focus of the investigation.<br />Also disturbing is the parading of quotes by the same group of former FBI profiler clowns that appear as talking heads on every true crime feature story or docudrama filmed: Ressler, McCrary, and Douglas.  \\"Former\\" implies they would not have access to case material, yet that didn't stop them from posting their opinions in chatrooms and in the media.  Aren't these the same guys that said the DC snipers (two black males), were a lone, disgruntled white guy?  Despite spouting their standard vagaries about what \\"might\\" eventually be found they offered nothing but empty speculation.<br />Additionally, the in-depth reporting is so sparse, the author had to include snippets of other unsolved crimes occurring in the area to keep it flowing and interesting.  Unsolved crimes that were never proven to be the work of Evonitz.  I guess they were added to get the body and page count up.<br />Though the Lisks and Silvas received some measure of closure with Evonitz committing suicide at the moment of his apprehension, and the subsequent forensic proof that he murdered the three girls in Spotsylvania, a distinct tragedy remains: There may well be other crimes for which Evonitz was responsible, but the families of those victims will never know that the perpetrator is dead and their daughters can rest in peace.<br />This is not a book of great detective work.  It was dumb luck.  Kara, the brave girl who escaped Evonitz and the fate of the those before her is to be commended.  Fortunately the cops in South Carolina shared her information and plight, which led to Evonitz popping up on the radar screen in Virginia.<br />But this reader is left with a haunting thought: If Major Smith and the Spotsylvania County investigators had done a better job investigating the June 1995 rape of a 13 year old, before three girls were murdered, all of it might have been prevented.<br />Very readable, but this work should have been more in-depth in exploring the background and psyche of Evonitz.  May he roast in hell.losure with Evonitz committing suicide at the moment of his apprehension, and the subsequent forensic proof that he murdered the three girls in Spotsylvania, a distinct tragedy remains: There may well be other crimes for which Evonitz was responsible, but the families of those victims will never know that the perpetrator is dead and their daughters can rest in peace.<br />This is not a book of great detective work.

I hope this is not his best work because it was somewhat lame as sci-fi and as a mystery.  As a mystery, a third grader should be able to figure out &quot;who done it&quot; by the end of the first chapter.  I was drawn to the book as sci-fi having no idea what to expect.  I was attracted by a futuristic police detective being paired with a robot that looked like the man who was murdered.<br />You don't have to know much about police work to determine that Asimov knew nothing about police work.  Apparently, he was under the impression that a police officer points a gun at someone and barks orders to get what he wants.  There is no clear purpose or method to what Lije Baley is investigating.  The science of today was clearly beyond Asimov's imagination of the 1950's.  He's apocalyptic description of an overpopulated earth of 8 billion people was way off and his predictions of space exploration, colonization, and the state of robotics was way off.<br />But still, this was a compelling book and a good read.  Though some of the logic was fuzzy and I would expect more from a robot, this book was entertaining and I will read the other robot novels.	2004-06-24

Though I felt the first novel started strong, TRIBULATION FORCE was somewhat of a let down for me.  Most of the writing is weak.  The romances are formulaic and not very compelling.  Much of Nicholae's ascension to power is simplistic.  I have a real problem with the President of the United States deciding to hand the reigns of power to a man no one heard of a few years earlier.  And, there is no attempt to explain the geopolitical climate.<br />I probably missed it in the two books I have read, but I have seen nothing to address the Islamic world or any other world religion.  It appears that only Christians and Jews exist in the world of LEFT BEHIND.<br />However, that said, I found the two &quot;witnesses&quot; at the wailing wall to be the most interesting characters in this second novel.  Their message that Jesus is the savior was portrayed in an interesting and compelling manner that kept me reading.<br />Additionally, I am interested in Rayford Steele and Buck Williams finding their paths increasingly intertwined with Nicholae's, in spite of their resistance.

Nor is there a story to correspond with the OUTER LIMITS episode of the 1960's, in which a robot is put on trial for murdering his creator.<br />After that disappointment, its time to get on with some good SCI FI yarns that deal with the evolution of the robots, beginning in the far future, about 1998.  Very interesting reading surrounding the three laws that are quoted numerous times in the other reviews of this section.  My favorite story was EVIDENCE, the second to last story, in which a man is accused of being a robot during an election.<br />This is my first Asimov book and it will not be my last.  It is easy to see why Asimov was so revered from these simple stories.  Very thought provoking and inoffensive.  Anyone from grade school on up would enjoy these stories.  I read the whole book in less than two days.	2004-06-11

I was amazed by the inner working of Hollywood and his rise to prominence in the film-making community.  It is all very interesting.<br />Though I enjoyed reading how Joe overcame adversity, coming to America a Hungarian refuged, determined to learn English and function in America, I was a bit turned off by his chronic infidelity.  Joe goes into laborious detail how he cheated on his first wife Gerri with this starlet or that bimbo, but is quick to forgive himself as \\"lonely\\" when he eventually settles down with the former wife of a family friend and quickly produces four boys.<br />Joe is less forgiving of his father who turned out to be a Nazi sympathizer who fled to America to escape war-crime charges.  I guess its an individual's perception of circumstances when deciding which sinners to forgive.<br />Though an opus, over 700 detailed pages, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about Hollywood behind the scenes, the world of a screen writer, and the undeniable success of an immigrant making it in America.	2004-06-09

Surprisingly, I found it very compelling.  Basically, LEFT BEHIND is a horror story, packaged as Christian fiction.  Though many have complained that it is written for a sixth grade level, it's important to note that it was written in an in-offensive manner for everyone.  I'd say it is appropriate for middle schoolers through elderly.<br />Predictably, the Christian message is sprinkled throughout the novel.  But that is to be expected.  Having read a lot of horror in the past I was surprised that the LEFT BEHIND story could be chilling at times.  Though many would say that it is Christian trash, I don't see much difference in suspending disbelief reading this as reading say a more popular author like Stephen King.<br />The book deals with the Rapture as described in the Bible.  The main characters, Rayford Steele and Buck Williams are left behind on a 747 piloted by Steele.  As a result of the Rapture and the disappearance of millions, Steele becomes born again, convinced all has occurred as prophesied in the Bible.  The Anti-Christ emerges as a Rumanian named Nicholae Carpathia.<br />I picked the book up aware that there were 12 novels in the series.  I figured LEFT BEHIND would be the only one I would try.  It was the obligatory intro to the series.  I plan to read the next one and see how it goes.<br />Overall, it was not as bad as I expected and I recommend it to anyone looking for a complete change of pace.	2004-06-09

But in reading this novel about the country, you would hardly know it.  Set around a journalist, Norman Clay, who is covering a bullfight, the reader is offered only tempting tidbits of what Mexico has to offer. I read JM's TEXAS, last year, which contained large portions that included descriptions and events in Mexico.  I assumed MEXICO would be more in depth and touch upon the rich culture of the Aztecs.  I was somewhat disappointed.<br />Though MEXICO did provide glimpses into the past of the Indians living in Mexico before the Spaniards came, the clashes with Cortez and the Conquistadors was sorely missing.  The Spanish rape of Mexico was barely tapped and I really wanted to read more about the politics that shaped today's nation of Mexico.  JM shortchanged the Mexican and Mexico with this book.  TEXAS was so brilliantly written, I guess lightening couldn't strike twice.<br />On the up side, I learned more than I ever wanted to know about bullfighting.  Though brief, the sections on the early Indians and the building of the pyramids was vivid and informative.	2004-03-22

I've read THE DAVINCI CODE and DECEPTION POINT.  A&amp;D takes the prize.  What a book!  Have you ever read anything that blends murder mystery, symbology, Catholicism, science, a secret society, and that Vatican?  Of course not.  This book is a first.<br />Even if Brown made this up and made errors in his descriptions of the inner workings of the papal process, this is still a masterful book blending a secret society of science called the Illuminati with the intrigue of Catholicism at the highest level.  A very interesting description of the process by which the Pope is elected.  I found the background workings of the popes office to be enlightening and entertaining.<br />This is Robert Langdon's first adventure, even before the DC.  All the characters are vividly described.  Though some have criticized this book as anti-Catholic, I was left with a great respect and appreciation of the religion.<br />I would highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for an above-average read.<br />My only criticism is that some of the murders are graphically described.  Not for the weak of stomach.	2004-03-07

For reasons that have little to do with the original, Jim soon finds himself on the run and en route to Treasure Island, to locate one of the pirates marooned there in the original--Joseph Tait--with an older John Silver and Ben Gunn.<br />Though an interesting novel written in the style of Robert Louis Stevenson's original, there are too many references to previous events, and not enough fleshing out of new characters.  This might have been better if the author, Francis Bryan, hadn't tried so hard to sound like Stevenson.<br />Worth the couple of days it will take you to get through it, but not overly compelling.	2004-02-20

As owner/editor of the Times, Traynor gets to know many of the local characters, not least of which is a black woman from the wrong side of the racially divided tracks, named Callie Ruffin.<br />Callie is THE LAST JUROR referred to in the title, as the novel is more about the relationship between her and Traynor than it is about the criminal, Danny Padgitt.  Grisham does not disappoint the reader, as by the end of his trial Padgitt threatens the jurors, that if they find him guilty he will &quot;get&quot; every one of them.  They find him guilty anyway.<br />Though sentenced to two &quot;life&quot; sentences in the Mississippi penal system, Padgitt ends up serving about 10 years.  And then jurors start getting murdered.<br />The meat of the book is devoted to Traynor and Callie and her remarkable family who have managed to educate themselves out of their racist little town.  Callie has broken barriers throughout her life, and being the first black to sit on a Ford County jury (and the last juror seated on the jury) was just one of her many accomplishments.  The lunches cooked by Callie for Traynor are mouthwatering to read.<br />Over all, the story and wonderful prose are very compelling.  With a twist ending that comes as a welcome surprise I felt this was Grisham's best work yet and I highly recommend it to Grisham fans and first time readers.	2004-02-11

Having not scored on the big screen with any of his books, though some of them would make great movies, he does not have the name recognition that Baldacci and Grisham do.  For that reason he is somewhat under-appreciated.<br />ZERO GAME is faced paced.  Its so fast paced, that the original first person narrator, Matthew Mercer is killed within the first 50 pages by a ruthless hitman named Janos.  Then Harris Sandler picks up the ball and starts running with it and Capitol page Vivian Parker.<br />Matthew and Harris are Capitol Hill Appropriators.  The decide what goes into bills and where the money goes.  The Zero Game refers to insiders like Matthew and Harris inserting various items into bills and betting to see if they get passed without question.  Things get deadly when a seemingly worth abandoned mine in South Dakota is inserted as a giveaway.<br />Harris and Viv learn that a lab to create Plutonium from worthless Neptunium, a byproduct of the nuclear process.  Unfortunately, the mine-shaft is run by a terrorist nation.  Thus, Janos is sent to clean things up and wipe out anyone in the know.<br />Fast and fun, but not as many twists and turns as some of Meltzer's previous works.  TENTH JUSTICE is still Meltzer's best book.  The underling being taken advantage of by outside interests is utilized again here.  Good entertainment, though, as others have noted, drawn out at times.<br />Still a good read.	2004-02-08

Anyone tired of crime and violence novels will love Daniel Cambridge, Martin's first person character in PLEASURE.  Though his mental stability keeps him confined to out of work status at his California apartment, Daniel finds attractive elements in each of the women he desires.  Charming them each in his non-aggressive way, Daniel eventually finds the love of his life through selfless, altruistic acts by merely being his sweet self.  Martin seems to know much about women with his honest observations and descriptions of their inner and outer beauty.  You almost wish he would pass along his secret to being a gentleman, but he is subtler than that. Quite simply, Daniel is a man you wish you knew in real life.<br />What is delightful about this novel beyond the brilliant prose and soothing descriptions, is knowing that when Steve Martin tires of acting we will be enjoying his novels.  I have been a Steve Martin fan for years, reading most of his offbeat books, and listening to all of his comedy albums.  I found SHOP GIRL to be a surprisingly fun novel to read.  Martin has raised the bar for himself with PLEASURE and I look forward to additional, and longer stories.  Steve Martin is truly a talent to be cherished.<br />Read this book.  You'll be glad you did.<br />Steve, write more and longer books!	2004-02-03

The Wolf is a Russian Mafioso involved with a Internet chat group who has men and women abducted for the sexual pleasure and perversion of moneyed clients.  Alex Cross in on the case again, this time joining the FBI and getting a little breathing room to travel cross country at will.  Though this is an interesting and needed development in the life of Cross, I felt Patterson could have done a better job<br />of providing detail in Crosses short time at Quantico.<br />Instead of spending some time with Cross at the academy and getting into the FBI culture, Patterson explains that Cross was told by the FBI Director to go to class when he could and graduate.  Totally unrealistic for an organization known for not bending over for anyone.  I felt Patterson missed a real opportunity in not exploring Quantico and the resources at the FBI academy.  But, now Cross is working as an Assistant Director in the FBI, without paying his dues.  That should make him real popular.<br />Anyway, Cross does his usual bang-up detective work and puts a stop to the Internet kidnappers.  All except the Wolf, who remains at large.  I look forward to the next episode and further developments in the Alex Cross saga.	2004-01-31

In a way, it was billed that way to me.  But the closest UNDERSTANDING ARABS comes to answering the question Why? is that many Arabs feel the US backing of Israeli boarders is in direct conflict with US reasoning behind going into Iraq in 1991 to enforce the boarders of Kuwait.  According to UA, a 2001 poll of various Middle Eastern countries indicate 90% of residents feel the Palestinian issue is among their top three concerns.  Unfortunately, this issue is not looked at in depth, no doubt because the author is not qualified to comment.<br />According to the author, \\"Arabs will rarely admit to errors if doing so will cause them to lose face.  To Arabs, honor is more important than facts.\\"  Additionally, \\"In arguing the Palestine issue...they (Arabs) often placed the greatest emphasis on the suffering of individuals rather than on points of law or recital of historical events.\\"  For someone who is trying to assist the lay person in understanding Arabs, this does not do much to portray Arabs as rational.  Much of what I've mentioned was sprinkled in between Arab complaints that they are maligned and vilified in the media.<br />By contrast Arabs do not like being judged by Westerners.  However, whereas the US makes a big deal of separating church and state, Arabs, fundamentally believe the two cannot be separated, and the religion of choice is Islam.<br />I found the section that describes the current socioeconomic conditions to be the most informative.  Many of the Arab nations suffer severe poverty.  The richest countries tend to be the most authoritarian.  (Saudi Arabia and Iraq.)  Surprisingly, the author found Iraq to be the most progressive, until recently.  (Saddam, progressive?) However, nothing is made of some of the fascist regimes in power in many of the Middle Eastern countries.  And there is no mention of the generous US aid heaped on many of these ungrateful countries.<br />Generally, there is a sense that if there is to be peace in the Middle East, the United States is going to have to do the lions share of the work.  But overall, I was left with a sense that the vast majority of Arabs are good and decent people just looking to make a life for themselves and their families.  In spite of some of my comments, this book left me with a positive view of the Arab condition.countries.<br />Generally, there is a sense that if there is to be peace in the Middle East, the United States is going to have to do the lions share of the work.

Following four established families from the beginning of American colonization and into the 70's, JM provides many perspectives into the Maryland's eastern shore.  The primary families are made up of boat builders, plantation owners, watermen, and a black family beginning with a kidnapped slave.  Fascinating stuff.<br />JM begins with the degeneration of the indigenous Indians and shows how colonization was destined to dominate less industrialized populations.  The Indians didn't stand a chance.  Usually, Michener is light on the characterization, but I would say he milked the characters to the bone with this one.  Just keep in mind, the story is about the development and socialization of the region, not so much the individual characters.  Though these characters are not given short shrift by any means.<br />I had always heard CHESAPEAKE was one of JM's best works, but at this point I would say I liked TEXAS and then CENTENNIAL better.  Great stuff here.  I hope to read all of Michener's novels.	2004-01-27

This is good news for President Zach Herney and bad news for presidential hopeful, Senator Sedgewick Sexton.  Or is it?  Deception point layers deception over perception.  Many of the characters do complete 180's by the end of the book, blending science and politics.<br /> The primary character, Senator Sexton's daughter, Rachel Sedgewick is sent to the Arctic by the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office) to confirm NASA's discovery that will ensure her father is NOT propelled into the White House by his very anti-NASA rhetoric.  No fan of the Senator, Rachel has no compunctions doing so.  While there she meets Michael Tolland, a respected host of an oceanic television show.<br />Together Rachel and Michael learn that the discovery is a fraud and there are government entities willing to kill to protect their carefully orchestrated deception.  Thrills and twists abound.  Dan Brown's 2001 effort, precedes the #1 best-selling DAVINCI CODE, but DB is clearly at the top of this game in this tight, compelling thriller.<br />A great and worthwhile read.	2004-01-09

Michelle Maxwell let a presidential candidate get abducted only a few feet away from her today.  Coincidence?  No way, this is a Baldacci novel, and there are plot twists and turns aplenty.  The thing about a Baldacci novel is nothing is ever as it appears at first.  If you wait a while and think you have it figured out, just read a few more pages because it will do a 180 on you.<br /><br />The best thing about SPLIT SECOND is the ever changing dynamic between the characters.  They go from adversaries to allies and back again.  No one is what they appear as they all sort of team up to solve the abduction of the latest victim.  A number of bodies pile up along the way, but it merely adds to the mystery.<br /><br />Though the story loses some of its credibility at the end during an elaborate re-staging of a crime by the villain, SPLIT SECOND is still a lot of fun to read.	2004-01-01

A couple of rookie cops are the budding serial killers whom Odd eventually stops.<br />And that's about it.

If this isn't his best book, it is one of his best.  At 1322 pages you would think that would be enough, but with all of the topics JM touches I actually found myself wanting more.<br />Mercifully this one does not start with the formation of the earth's crust.  Instead, JM jumps into the action and begins a saga that lasts almost 500 years.  From the Indians, to the Spanish Friars, to the Alamo, gunslingers, frontiersmen, immigrants, cattleman, entrepreneurs, Texas Rangers, real estate barons, King Cotton, oil men, and football.  This only scratches the surface.<br />JM follows the lives of several families from their immigration to Texas and the lives they cut out for themselves while there.  Beyond fascinating.

Farentino plays Bobby more than Bobby thinks he's playing Farentino.<br />There is plenty of sex, language, humor, plot twists, and more sex.  Though some have claimed this to be a bit skimpy, I say, \\"Who cares?\\"  It's an engaging story and a real page turner.

Though this book has been characterized as an airing of dirty laundry, I felt PB had nothing but respect for his employers and had nothing but nice things to say about the Queen.  PB seemed an honorable man caught up in the circumstances of the crumbling marriage of the prince and princess.  PB shows respect to Prince Charles, but does let him have it a few times by merely citing unflattering behavior.<br />PB stays out of the action until approximately page 300 when Diana dies.  Up until then he provides a birds-eye view of what goes on at Buckingham Palace and later Kensington.  I found his workaday descriptions very interesting and unlike anything I had ever read before.  He really seemed to love what he was doing.<br />PB kicks into a higher gear when he is accused of stealing from the royal family and misappropriating Diana's correspondence.  In many ways this was not a typical tell all and PB did not dwell on dirt.  He evened a few scores by telling people what he thought of them, but never got malicious.<br />It ended with drama in the court room when the Queen came to his aid.  If it was fiction, it would never have rung true.<br />This book is worth reading because it's not dirt and provides some fascinating background to first timers interested in the royals.	2003-11-20

I came to this book thinking it would be a hatchet job on the right by confirmed lefty.  If you read this for the humor alone you'll be fine.  This is one of the few books to make me laugh out loud while reading.  The funniest thing was AF's proposed commercial of Presidential candidate John Kerry running a commercial dressed up as a pirate and poking fun at W for dressing up as a fighter pilot for his photo op.<br />I like Bush and I like the right, but AF managed to score some points on Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly in an amusing way and using unbelievable quotes from their own books.  Though AF accuses the right of blaming Clinton for everything, AF doesn't bother to lay anything at Clinton's doorstep.  It is because of that, that LIES lacks some credibility.  If AF had pointed his sharp tongue at Gore and Clinton as often as he did at W, Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, etc., this book would have bordered on &quot;Fair and Balanced.&quot;<br />AF says Gore should have won the presidency.  Fine.  If Gore's so great and came so close to being president, why isn't he running for the 2004 bid?  How come he couldn't win in his own state of Tennessee and make the vote in Florida moot?  If the folks in Tennessee don't have confidence in Al Gore, why should the rest of us?  If they had Gore would be president today.<br />Great read whether your an elephant or an ass.	2003-11-15

Having never read a book about Diana, I found this to be very informative and tragic.  Diana appears to have been a very misunderstood and lonely person, caught up in circumstances she had no control over. You just want to reach into her life and comfort her.<br />Prince Charles was clearly the villain in the relationship as much of his behavior has been confirmed in the media since her death.  His refusal to discontinue his relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles speaks for itself.  How anyone could pick CPB over Diana in unfathomable.  What was never addressed was what Andrew Parker-Bowles thought about the relationship between his wife and Prince Charles.  Both Camilla and Charles denied there was a relationship.  What a crock.<br />The book provides a great back-story to Princess Diana's untimely death.  But there is no prediction about an impending car accident as Diana's Butler Paul Burrell now claims.  However she did make a haunting prediction in 1992 on page 220 that did come true, &quot;I am performing a duty as the Princess of Wales ... but I don't see it any longer than 15 years.&quot;<br />A good introduction to someone who knows nothing about Diana.	2003-11-06

Again he proves he can write something other than a legal thriller, but again, you wish he would flesh the story out a bit more than the meager 163 pages offered here.<br />The impending death of the Messina Spartans' football coach Eddie Rake is the focus, as seen through the eyes of a high school football hero has-been by the name of Neely Crenshaw.  Crenshaw grudgingly returns to Messina awaiting the death of his former coach.  He spends his time reminiscing with former friends and players and enjoys the brotherhood of all who played for coach Rake.  Crenshaw reexamines his life since the high school gridiron and attempts to right a wrong with a girl from high school.<br />There is a bit of intrigue, as Grisham waits well into the story to explain &quot;what happened&quot; to sour Crenshaw to Rake.  Much of the criticism of this book has been harsh.  Though I would love to have seen something more the length of THE PAINTED HOUSE I enjoyed the telling of this story.  Grisham's prose pull you in.  You realize how well this book is written when you consider the whole story about football is told with 90% of the action occurring in the bleachers.<br />Bottom line: This is worth reading.	2003-11-03

In a nutshell, it is a Japanese version of Stalag 17.  It is the story of American, British, and Australian POW's at Changi prison camp.  A place where the real world is turned completely upside down.  In addition to being prisoners, the POW's find their ranks are meaningless.  Devoid of societal/military rules &quot;the strong&quot; survive.  #1 is &quot;the King,&quot; an American corporal who runs the prison camp from the inside.<br />The King effectively manipulates everyone in the camp from Colonels on down, through his payroll system.  If you want money, eggs, cigarettes, medicine, you have to see the King.  If you want to sell something, everyone knows you go through the King.<br />Suspense is derived from the near misses of getting caught by the Japanese or the pip-squeak MP, Captain Grey.  Grey's sole motivation is catching the King &quot;breaking the rules.&quot;  Much of the action is seen through the eyes of Peter Marlowe, an affable English lieutenant to whom the King takes a liking due to his command of the local language and it's value to the King in trading and conversing with the guards.<br />The King teeters on the edge of good and evil throughout the book, never completely falling off the fence to either side.  Under the circumstances, the reader tends to forgive the King's &quot;business&quot; dealings over this lack of compassion for the suffering around him.  But when the suffering befalls Marlowe, the King reacts as a true friend and saves Marlowe's arm from amputation.<br />The finale is somewhat ambiguous and anticlimactic.  The man who was once on top, the King, is reduced to a lowly corporal again and the many officers and outranking enlisted men are quick to see the King put back into his place when they are rescued and order is restored.<br />The books is adequate at best as there are no major conflicts or plot twists.  But it is one of the few books telling the story of a Japanese POW camp.	2003-10-14

Unfortunately, he doesn't stray very far.  The three main characters, Jack Ryan, Jr., and his cousins, Dominic and Brian Caruso, are assembled as a team for an agency called \\"The Campus\\" to deal with the terrorist threat against America in classic Clancy fashion.<br />Captain Brian Caruso is a US Marine, back from operations in Afghanistan; and rookie FBI agent Dominic Caruso, following a case in which he kills a child kidnaper/molester, are summarily recruited by The Campus, to work on a special project that is just getting underway.  Though the Carusos are left in the dark as to the purpose of their training, the reader sees from page one that some terrorists are going to die.<br />Later, Ryan, Jr., joins the crew as an analyst who points his cousins at the terrorists he manages to ferret out of e-mail intelligence.<br />Clancy does a good job of identifying the one thing a Clancy fan wants to read right now: Americans killing terrorists ala WITHOUT REMORSE.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do it with the pizzazz or plot development he has in the past.  In fact, other than identifying targets and sending the Carusos out to kill, there isn't a heck of a lot of plot here.<br />TC tries to make a case for sending hit squads out to kill terrorists before and after the fact, but in doing so, makes a better case for showing why it would be more beneficial to make criminal cases against them, prosecute them, and gather intelligence to identify and locate even more terrorists.  Dead terrorists can't talk about other terrorists.  Surprisingly, this is not even addressed by the characters engaged in the activity.<br />Though I have criticized TC in the past for \\"too many words,\\" TEETH OF THE TIGER would have been a much better work if its 431 pages had been fleshed out a little further.  There was little conflict and the bad guys might as well have been sitting ducks for all the characterization that went into them.<br />His earlier works are still his best.aracterization that went into them.<br />His earlier works are still his best.	2003-10-02

The story grabs you by the collar and drags you along at a brisk pace.  Dan Brown gives you everything; an albino, monk hitman; a brilliant art historian; a beautiful French detective with a specialty in cryptology; a secret society called the Knights Templar; and a substantive search for the Holy Grail.<br />What places this book a cut above the rest is the layering of art history and religious history integral to the story.  You read the factoids Brown sprinkles here and there and you wonder, &quot;Is that true?&quot;  If any of it is true, Brown has made some pretty controversial statements regarding the foundations of Christian beliefs and traditions.  But that makes it all the more delicious to read.  For those reasons THE DAVINCI CODE is better than your run of the mill cops and robbers mystery/thrillers.<br />The book begins with murder at the Louvre Museum near the Mona Lisa.  Clues are left everywhere and everything written has meaning and will be referred to later in the book.  The characters are very clearly delineated and do not melt into one another.  I was stunned by how breezily this book reads and how many twists and turns Brown threw into the mix.<br />Then I got to page 405 and became very disappointed.  At that point I found the book a bit unbelievable.  Up to page 405 everything seemed plausible.  But the book had a heavy head of steam up to that revelation.  The very end was a bit underwhelming, as the first 400 pages promised much more.<br />I highly recommend this read, but the conclusions to all the characters were a little too pat and easy.  There is no big shoot out at the end, but I expected something a bit more exciting than what I received.	2003-09-18

From the Bora-Borans, to the stuffy missionaries, to the exploited Chinese, to the equally exploited Japanese, to something of equilibrium, the message is clear; JM was into haole guilt 40 years before it became politically correct to lay all blame on the white race.  Apparently, the Hawaiians have a word for Caucasians, &quot;Haole.&quot;  In spite of JM's insistence that the haoles are the root of all evil, this was a great book about the struggles of the various ethnic backgrounds to make it in a new land.  I read it on my way to Hawaii and while I was there.  My one mistakes was not reading more of it before my trip.  Very rich in detail and extremely informative.  I found the view of the Hawaiian Japanese during the bombing of Pearl Harbor to be of particular interest.  New perspectives on historical events are always welcome.	2003-07-28

Under 150 pages once you subtract the forward by Al Santoli and the appendix. (Personally, I'm not sure Santoli's forward--bordering on diatribe--belongs here.)  This might have made a better expose magazine article somewhere, but it never would have made the money it's making on the bestsellers list.<br />Given the brevity, I don't understand why so many people seem to have a problem with whether or not the book is true.  I think LTC Patterson put himself out on a limb by not naming the people that witnessed Clinton's behavior with him.  To me the risk ads credence to the allegations.  And wouldn't a guy make more dramatic statements if he was going to make the whole thing up?<br />I would like to see some reporter make more of these allegations and expand upon them.  The Clinton's disdain wasn't limited to the military.  They regularly referred to their security detail as \\"the pigs.\\"  It's unbelievable that such ill-mannered, arrogant, and inexperienced people were ever allowed to run the country.<br />LTC Patterson squarely lays the blame for 911 on President Clinton's indecisive shoulders.

This book is a real page turner.  Though rumors persist that Charriere made PAPILLON up, there are enough nuggets of truth to make you think otherwise.  I had a little trouble with Papi's consistent nobility throughout.  Charriere leads you to believe he was a gentleman throughout.  Kind of hard to believe.  Also, he's a little sketchy on his conviction for murder.  That leads me to believe he probably commited the crime for which he was convicted.  I would agree that the French system of justice was pretty harsh back in the 1930's, but I'm sure Charriere exaggerated \\"a little\\" here and there.<br />But don't get me wrong.

I still think about it every now and then even though I read it in 2000.  A real page turner in spite of it's girth.  When 911 happened, I immediately thought of this book.  John Corey is back from PLUM ISLAND and better than ever.  I hope DeMille can keep up the quality because he raised the bar with this novel.  Very timely considering today's geopolitical climate.  I can't recommend this book any higher.	2003-04-15

This is some funny stuff.  CM has a quirky view on things and really knows how to turn a clever phrase.  I had a good time reading this book, but it was just a little too long.  I think CM could have deleted a few chapters to tighten things up.  His shorter novels read funnier.  This story didn't warrant 400+ pages.	2003-04-15

If you can imagine a nation run by thugs and Mafia-types you understand what Saddam is all about.  Saddam is Hitler without morals.  At least Hitler decided NOT to use his chemical weapons.  Coughlin details the life of a boy brought up on the knee of his Nazi-loving uncle.  What a shock he turned out the way he did.<br />Very timely information.  Many of the questions asked in the media today were answered by Coughlin in this 2002 book.  You can't finish this book without thinking President Bush did the right thing going into Iraq.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the writing itself.  Coughlin skips around, throws a lot of names and history at you, and not always in chronological order.  A heavy book, but extremely informative.  Anyone who wants to comment on the war with Iraq should read this first.	2003-04-13

Someone needs to introduce TC to a good editor, because there was no excuse for the length of this book.  It really bogged down the pace and made the novel a chore to read.  There was a time when you could count on TC for good tight writing, but those days appear to be over.  He hasn't been the same since EXECUTIVE ORDERS.  His earlier works are still his best.  After this fiasco, it will be a long time before I pick up another Clancy novel.	2003-04-07

On 911 everyone witnessed Giuliani great leadership.  But that is just a fraction of what Giuliani achieved during his tenure as NYC mayor.  You talk about someone stepping up to the plate and doing the hard things, Giuliani delivered.  Reading the book you wish he was still in some kind of public service.  We need more guys like this.	2003-04-07

Sometimes I'm disappointed, sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed this book.  Reading Grisham you try to figure out how it's going to go at the end.  I'm still getting over the last page of THE PARTNER.  I enjoyed this book and I liked the ending.  I breezed through this novel in two days.  That's how into it I was.  Not his best work, but solid work.	2003-04-07

But those books are few and far between.  I can't recommend this book to anyone.  I stick with SK because I hope to get another SALEM'S LOT, GREEN MILE, or MISERY.  Every once in a while SK will sneak up on you and deliver a gem, but he's been shooting blanks for a long time.  I'm getting really tired of waiting and reading and being sorely disappointed.  Only King's great prose carry you through this mercifully short novel.	2003-04-07

I really enjoyed it.  It begins with the events of 911 and carries the reader through the war on terror in Afghanistan.  Very interesting and readable.  I blew threw it in a couple of days and wished there were much more.  This book will give you confidence in the President whether you're a fan or not.  One of Woodward's best works.  I would have rated this a 5, but it left me wanting more.  I really want part 2.	2003-04-04

An interesting idea, but not very well fleshed out or expanded.  I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife.  So who cared if she became infected.	2003-03-26

In fact, this is his worst.  It kind of runs out of steam about half way through.  His earlier works have been breezier and swifter reading.<br />LAMB is the life of Christ as seen through the eyes of his best friend Biff.  Moore adds a lot of humor not found in the Bible.  Jesus alternately killing a lizzard and bringing it back to life, and Biff lusting after Mary.  Apparently, the mother of Jesus was hot.  Unfortunately, after the bits of humor played out, the thing starts to get a bit tedious.<br />Enjoyable, but I can't help thinking CM could have done more with the material, given his particular slant.	2003-03-26
