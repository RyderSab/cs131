True, there are several chapters on how to improve asanas, but most of the book treats of yoga as a spiritual discipline, something that is often overlooked today since yoga has become a form of fitness for most Westerners. Therefore you will find lots of spiritual instructions in the book on how to lead a moral life, etc., etc. Hindu concepts of retribution (karma) and ignorance (avidya), among others, are discussed at length. There is a very long chapter, one-third of the book maybe, reproducing the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali (are you really interested, dear reader?)<br /><br />Other things you will find in this book is long and abundantly illustrated chapters on the author, his family and his master, several interviews of Desikachar and, as I said, copious texts on Hindu religion. All photographs and drawings are black and white and of rather poor quality.<br /><br />The chapters on asanas are certainly useful and interesting, and there are examples of asana sequences which you can practice, but everything you will find in the Heart of Yoga concerning Hatha Yoga and postures is rather short and of a general nature. One feels that the book is not intended for people who want to teach themselves yoga. Rather this seems to be a kind of general introduction for people who practice under a guru. And as I said, the emphasis is on spirituality and right (Hindu) living.<br /><br />For those of you who can find them and read French fluently, I highly recommend the books on Ashtanga yoga written by Andre van Lysbeth. They are available on amazon.fr. They are invaluable.	2005-08-12
US	27484262	R1M78J5OZH2XKV	0380012863	129257055	Jonathan Livingston Seagull	Books	1	34	62	N	N	Just plain wrong	Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a pseudo-Christian parable retelling the story of Jesus in the form of a seagull. The language is simple and unadorned, with very little worth calling \\"style\\". As a literary work, Jonathan Livingston is a very mediocre piece of writing, if olny because its characters are so artificial and lacking in depth. Jonathan Livingston cannot really move you because it is simply a prop for Richard Bach's idea of Perfection. It is an allegory and nothing more. Bad writers who have lots of ideas but have lived and observed little can only people their novels with allegories.<br /><br />Concerning the Jesus simile, let me add that the only difference between Bach's story and the canonical Gospels is that the underlying theology of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is basically Unitarian (from another point of view one could also describe it as Pelagian): Jonathan was not born a divine bird from a virgin and he is not fundamentally different from other seagulls. If in the end he attains divine \\"seagullhood\\", it is only through his own \\"superseagullan\\" efforts. In a way, Jonathan, as his very name indicates, is John the Baptist unredeemed by grace. Hence all the toil and sweat. Augustine of Hippo would have been appalled by this book...<br /><br />Put very simply, Richard Bach's philosophy is one that tells you to make strenuous and unrelenting efforts in order to become the strongest, the wisest and the most beautiful seagull (human being) ever. Salvation is elsewhere, in a realm of luminous and perfect seagulls. In a way, this book could be used to illustrate the absurd and arrogant Olympic motto of \\"altius, citius,fortius\\".<br /><br />Therefore, there is hardly anything new or original to be found in the worldview the book sets forth. And contrary to what some reviewers claim, it is not a revolutionary philosophy. Jonathan is only superficially a rebel. His rebellion is in fact taking place in a very old framework: that of heroic struggle. It is true that the heroic model has fallen into disrepute and we now live in the epicurean bourgeois mode, but to claim that Jonathan is an absolute rebel is false. As I hinted before, this book could have easily been written by a Christian ascetic, and, indeed, what the book teaches can be regarded as a form of extreme asceticism, with the refinement that it is aesthetically appealing. Violence is often aesthetically satisfying.<br /><br />No wonder everyone succumbs to the charm of the story: such thinking has been preached relentlessly from the pulpit and from other places of authority for the last 2000 years. I can't help thinking that the message of becoming The Ideal Human Being and of escaping the world through effort and holy war against oneself is essentially a Fascist idea. One could also say that it is the core of the Darwinist social manifesto. The idea that one should strive to become the best permeates our whole society, specially our economy, and is only superficially a message of hope and optimism. It is in reality a message of hateful tyranny, the tyranny of the Ideal over the Real. But we fail to see it because this message is not only familiar to us, it is also aesthetically tremendously attractive. Spiritually, we are all Platonists and flesh-haters at heart.<br /><br />As a philosophical tale, this book, which, as I said, is not very well written, cannot be compared, even remotely, with such unsurpassed masterworks as \\"The Little Prince\\" by French author Saint-Exupery or \\"Zorba the Greek\\" by Cretan writer Nikos Kazantzakis. The Little Prince is pessimistic and suffused with sadness and nostalgia (a typical French mix), but is full of original ideas and insights of great depth, besides being a radical critique of modern society. It is a book one can read and re-read and still find full of enigmas and hidden messages.<br /><br />\\"Zorba the Greek\\" is a hymn to life lived in simplicity and in straightforwardly rejoicing in the senses, the very opposite of the austere message of Jonathan Livingston. And it has style and beauty. It is a book about loving Incarnation, whereas Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a book about pseudo-spiritual escapism based on violence against oneself.<br /><br />For those who want philosophy written not in the form of myth but plainly, Jiddu Krishnamurti's books may also work as a potent antidote to Richard Bach's destructive idealism and the illusory hopes it generates. They may also teach you the right kind of effort. Jonathan Livingston represents in my view the wrong kind of effort.y opposite of the austere message of Jonathan Livingston.

One day, while I was in the grip of these tormenting thoughts, I walked into my garden. Suddenly I saw my cat jump on a small rodent. I immediately rushed to the rescue of the tiny animal. After I had delivered it and given my cat a good but useless scolding, I remembered my previous painful engagement with thought. To my utter astonishment, the problem and the thinking that went with it-- or rather had created it--had totally disappeared!<br /><br />This simple anecdote may serve to illustrate the main error of Eckhart Tolle's teachings. The mournful round of thoughts had come to an abrupt end not because I had tried to stop it, but because there was a sudden, unpremeditated gap in it, caused by an unexpected incident that had required all my attention. Now what Eckhart wants you to do is to bring about this change through effort, and he gives you tricks to achieve it. All this obviously implies a motive (putting an end to an unpleasant state), compulsion and time, all of which indicate that thought--the cause of all the mischief and misery--is still active. Instead of identifying with thought or resisting the now, what one is now doing is trying to disidentify oneself from it or to say \\"yes\\" to the now. This is another game by exactly the same actor.<br /><br />Therefore this path is not going to lead you very far. It is as simple as that.<br /><br />The book itself is written in very simple English and in a question and answer format. I noted that the author claims that his words, specially the repetitive parts of the book, can draw you into the nothingness from which they came. Maybe. What I have found is that the Power of Now is mostly very vapid prose full of cheap and hackneyed notions spiced up with a few Gospel and Zen quotes. The aim seems to be the \\"end of suffering\\", which makes enlightenment a kind of Ultimate Prozac. The author insists that it is something that is \\"felt\\" and speaks of the unending bliss resulting from residing in Being. All this seems too superficial, too epidermic to be true. And creates tremendous expectation. No wonder people start making superhuman efforts to be awake after reading the book. Unfortunately, when you try to force thinking to stop, it comes back at your throat with a vengeance. Remember the anecdote at the beginning of this review.<br /><br />If you are a serious spiritual seeker, I recommend J.Krishnamurti instead of E.T. See my own review of \\"Total freedom\\" for more information.<br /><br />Finally, let me tell you something: Eckhart Tolle sells photographs of his uninspiring face on his website. Five dollars for a view of his congested face absorbed in meditation or smiling at the disciple/customer. Isn't that enough to show the vulgarity of the whole thing?<br /><br />Move on, truth is not to be found here.is something that is \\"felt\\" and speaks of the unending bliss resulting from residing in Being.

Who ever listened to him when he was still with us? At the end of his life, people were deriding him because apparently nobody, not a single child in all the schools he had founded in Europe, America and India, had awakened. Apparently, it was all a failure and today Brockwood Park, the school he helped set up in England, is begging money because hardly anybody sends gifts or remembers K's noble educational cause in his will.<br /><br />This message is truly an austere and challenging message of no hope, of no tomorrow of guaranteed liberation. There is no comforting Krishnamurtite doctrine to hold onto. This the mind must irrevocably hate if it is flippant, looking for pleasure or security.<br /><br />I first read Krishnaji when I was still a staunch traditionalist Catholic. I think the title of the unassuming little volume was \\"Letters to Students\\". Although it was couched in very simple terms and contained no slick neo-advaita paradoxes about nonpeople having ever bought any shoes, I didn't understand a word of what was said and thought the man must be some sort of crazy radical. The only idea that stuck with me was the saying \\"a truly humble man doesn't know he is humble\\". That sounds awfully trite, but it isn't. It is so true.<br /><br />We never know it. We can never say: \\"This is it!\\"<br /><br />Krishnamurti truly has nothing to offer you. Most of what he says are questions, invitations to enquire. But he also knows how to write delightful prose, describing nature and people with a love that is both quiet and poignant. In his essays, which make up about half of this superb collection of Krishnamurti's works, one is first invited to wonder at the fragile beauty of the world and to rest for a timeless moment in the innocence of trees, rivers, mountains and a clear starry night sky, before being taken to the enquiry and the clarity of its burning flame.<br /><br />Who can enquire at all?, some clever neo-advaitists will perhaps ask derisively. You. You can look at your life and see all the deception and mischief wrought by the predatory \\"me\\", the \\"self\\". Although it is true that K. speaks of going beyond the self, there is not so much as a hint in all of K's works that people are walking nobodies devoid of volition. Buddha, who preached anatta, non-ego, also enjoined people to act. Krishnamurti assumed as a given truth that we could truly do something about ourselves and therefore about the terrible state of the world. But the doing was first and foremost a seeing. One is invited to see, and to keep seeing.<br /><br />Seeing what? One's desperate and ugly face, one's mean ego and its for ever reborn attempts at escaping reality. To see it in the chaos and violence in the world outside and also within, for \\"the world is you and you are the world\\". This coming face to face with oneself happened through the teachings, which he liked to compare to a mirror.<br /><br />It is important to see in the context of rampant teachings about Consciousness Already Realized and Being Perfect Right Now that the image K showed his hearers wasn't a hypothetical and dogmatically asserted feel-good \\"perfect oneness\\", but \\"what is\\" in all its disturbing crudeness. Therefore it is no wonder that the Ultimate Mystery, when he talked about it, which he did rarely, was expressed by the word \\"Otherness\\". How could \\"otherness\\" be \\"already the case\\"?<br /><br />For that to arise, the reality of evil had to be faced. But it was to be faced without judgment, in choiceless or passive awareness. Then and only then, would the transformation occur as the observer would realize his fundamental identity with the observed. It is certainly one of the great and painful paradoxes of this teaching that it vehemently denounces evil within and without, but at the same time shows that colllective and individual holy wars against it will inevitably not only fail, but aggravate the situation. Yoga, rituals, breathing techniques and the rest of the religious arsenal of self-improvement are dismissed as so many routines of the ego. There only remains a passionate inquiry, which is wisdom in search of itself.<br /><br />Asked by a swami how he would sum up his whole message, he reluctantly said: \\"Look\\". It is important to see, specially in our sense and eye-obsessed culture, that he didn't say, \\"See this\\", \\"this\\" referring to the outside world. K. is not inviting you to lose yourself in the object. Rather he is inviting you to observe, relentlessly but affectionately, the movement of thought, which is the ego. When its utter destructiveness is recognized WITHOUT any judgment or preconception, something else arises, which K. always refused to theorize about.<br /><br />The difference between \\"Look\\" and \\"See this\\", which is the slogan of neo-advaita, is a crucial one, one that distinguishes a teaching about immanence and transcendence and the creative and challenging tension between the two, and one that confuses the Absolute with sensual experience and thereby dissolves all creative tension in the mere frictionless movement of the \\"already\\" known.<br /><br />There can be no rest and its corollary, dogmatism, in this. Krishnaji often summed up our existential condition by conjuring the striking metaphor of someone living in a small room with a deadly cobra. As he often said, \\"It is only the serious man who lives\\". One is invited to realize the danger and seriousness of living in the world. And even when the transformation has occurred, it isn't the case that one simply self-contentedly celebrates, but there is a constant \\"learning\\", a deepening without end and without accumulation because Life is never known completely, because Life is for ever new. To use a word that is greatly appreciated in some quarters, there is for ever more \\"oneness\\" because the content of \\"oneness\\" is inexhaustible.<br /><br />Therefore learn, o eternal beginner!ement are dismissed as so many routines of the ego.

US	27484262	R1DME7RQESE1PC	0954779223	936667376	Already Awake: Dialogues with Nathan Gill	Books	2	113	160	N	N	Only already half-awake	I don't know dear reader if you realize, as I painfully do now, that being half-awake is a far worse state to be in than being completely asleep and that half-truths are far more misleading and damaging than total untruths. Why this is so, I needn't explain because I assume that you are an intelligent person.<br /><br />ALREADY AWAKE by British author Nathan Gill, former disciple of self-proclaimed divine avatar Adi Da Samraj and follower of British Nothingness \\"communicator\\" Tony Parsons, is in my opinion just that: a collection of half-truths by someone who is only half-awake, but thinks he's got it, that this is it and there is nothing else. But before I go into the content of the book, let me say a few words about form.<br /><br />ALREADY AWAKE is a short book expounding the theory and practice of neo-advaita, a modern offshoot of the age-old advaita or non-dualistic school of so-called \\"Hinduism\\". It is a teaching that basically dismisses the diversity we see in the world as a mere divine mirage, thereby denying the existence of the individual not only at the psychological level, but also at the metaphysical level.<br /><br />The 159 pages of ALREADY AWAKE take longer to read than the gospel of neo-advaitist parson Tony Parsons AS IT IS because here there is reading matter on all pages, not just an empty page on the left with some more or less illuminating sayings on the right. The form in which the \\"doctrine\\" is set forth is mainly that of a series of real dialogues, but there is a short, continuous text by Nathan at the beginning of the book. Called \\"Clarity\\", it can be read for free on his Democratic Spirituality Ring website nathangill.com. If you are new to neo-advaita, it might be good to check that first.<br /><br />What you will read then is basically transcripts of conversations with real people. One assumes that there has been a careful selection of what to print because all the dialogues run smoothly and no substantial challenges are offered, which can hardly reflect the actual situation.<br /><br />The language, thank Already Present Wakefulness, is quite limpid and jargon-free. You won't have to fight here with obscure neologisms ending in -ness and there isn't the annoying repetitive drumming of negative formulas one finds in Tony Parsons' writings and talks. Briefly, if you want to understand what neo-advaita is all about, this is certainly to place to start. But in my view, there is no need to read more books after that because there is nothing more neo-advaitists can tell you. I also doubt whether what they say is really worth listening to. Of course, what can also happen is that you may become enlightened as a result of reading this book...<br /><br />This could happen because not all that is being said here is false.<br /><br />What is absolutely true here is that only the present, life happening, is true and liberating, that thinking mesmerizes us, that seeking enlightenment and practicing meditation techniques is a self-deceptive game and that the subject-object distinction that characterizes all our understanding processes has no ultimate value. That is absolutely true and thank Nameless Clarity for telling us that! This is also the core message of many teachers of the past, of whom I consider Jiddu Krishnamurti to be one of the most enlightening.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the only thing Oneness is saying in ALREADY AWAKE.<br /><br />The problem begins (and in a sense ends) with the title of the book itself: ALREADY awake, a notion that comes directly out of the teachings of Adi Da Samraj. Any intelligent person will recognize that words like \\"already\\", \\"not yet\\", \\"always\\", \\"now\\", etc. are all closely related to psychological time, time as imagined by the mind. These words are part and parcel of the mesmerizing process of thinking, what Nathan calls \\"the story\\". Therefore the very title of this book betrays a lack of wakefulness and clarity, a shoddiness in the use of language.<br /><br />But it couldn't be otherwise because neo-advaita is itself a product of thought. It is a belief system like all the other ideologies, philosophies and religions that keep people entertained. The core error is contained in the oft-repeated assertion that everything IS (already!) Oneness and that illusion is just Oneness playing games with Itself. IOW, these \\"teachers\\" don't recognize that oneness unrecognized is quite a different thing from Oneness recognized. For them, to be awake or asleep is exactly the same thing, but they don't realize that this view invalidates all their teaching activity.<br /><br />A natural consequence of this doctrine is that Oneness is seen as essentially static, ALREADY perfect, like a huge still picture with random content. Oneness is not going anywhere, it is a cosmic robot wih no purpose. The trick is to see it and enjoy the joke. What neo-advaitists don't see is that Oneness is not ALREADY perfect and therefore static, but for ever moving toward greater Oneness, which is the same thing as saying that it is oriented toward greater LOVE, for the song of Oneness is LOVE. Therefore WILL and active COMPASSION need to be reintroduced into the system: let us send tents and food to Africa, not just enjoy a beer at the local pub, Nathan!<br /><br />Let the reader understand the following: it is wrong to think that there are veils or obstacles there that prevent us from becoming awakened. Such an idea inevitably creates conflict, violence, for ever frustrated seeking and restlessness. It also naturally creates the \\"I\\". The \\"I\\" is nothing more than an illusory entity whose whole purpose, whose very essence is a desperate fight to overcome \\"what is\\", seen as an obstacle or a transition to something else. This deceptive way is the way of most religions and ideologies in our present world. It is the stimulating way of the Warrior.<br /><br />But it is equally wrong to claim that the obstacles have ALREADY been removed and will NEVER be there NO MATTER what one does. This is the neo-advaitist error, one that invites the seeker to go to sleep for ever if truth is not realized \\"instantly\\". This error stems among other things from a shoddy use of the present tense, which leads neo-advaitists to inadvertently and continually engage in what Nathan in a different context calls \\"an (undue)extension into past and future\\". Present tense in English points both to something happening and constantly changing, the very stuff of Life itself with its countless possibilities, of which Awakening is one, AND to imaginary time, what are called \\"general truths\\".<br /><br />Neo-advaitist teachers seem to be pointing to both things simultaneously, which enables them to say that everything one may do is just \\"divinely appropriate\\" and can't be avoided anyway, which is a nice way of restating good old Oriental fatalism or Calvinistic predestination (without God, hell and devil of course!).<br /><br />All this is thought playing its usual games of self-deception based on time (imaginary time). This \\"ALREADY\\" thing is a total negation of the Unknown. This is the chloroformed way of the tired and lazy Bourgeois.<br /><br />From the wrong assumtion that one is \\"ALREADY awake\\" and that everything IS Oneness arise many other errors, not the least of which is to think that the life of an awakened person needn't be different from that of an unawakened one. What is being promised is just a sense of greater ease, less tension and grasping. In other words, what is being presented as Awakening is a purely individual and subjective experience of relaxation, coupled with a conceptual aloofness from what happens within and outside the so-called \\"character\\", which is then conceptually recognized as \\"mere play\\".<br /><br />In this comforting theatrical view of the \\"pointless\\" world, which blantantly implies a duality of play versus spectator and of appearance versus reality, there occurs a complete divorce between seeing and doing. Contemplation andaction are no longer one, action in the world being looked down upon. One can live a very disharmonious life full of strife and problems, and still claim to liberated because \\"all there is is ALREADY oneness\\". A rapist can be a self-conscious saint. Moral relativism has found its ultimate justification.<br /><br />Another error is the infuriating confusion between the \\"character\\" and the living individual. We ALREADY know that for neo-advaitism all the diversity in the world is superficial, a mere \\"appearance\\". Only Oneness is real. There are no people out there, there is only the SUPER-NON-entity called \\"One\\".<br /><br />The confusion here is to think that because the ego is indeed a mental construct of very limited significance, a transient contractile point in consciousness, that which underlies the ego must be a negation, a \\"nobody\\", which naturally leads to the idea that there is only one (non)person in the whole Universe, namely the \\"One\\". I say that this is an unproven inference, one that in fact makes genuine compassion impossible, for how could there be love for mere \\"characters\\"?<br /><br />There could be individuals who are not separate and ego-centered. As Krishnamurti liked to say, \\"individual\\" means un-divided. For those who are interested, this is what German philosopher Leibniz called \\"monads\\", spiritual beings endowed with the wholeness, immortality and indivisibility of the Supreme Monad \\"God\\". That is what we are but goes unrecognized. We either think we are separate individuals, or \\"parts\\" of the Whole or, like neo-advaitists, nobodies and therefore ALREADY the Whole (\\"I am Oneness/God!\\"). All of these hypotheses may be absolutely wrong. If you find Leibniz too hard to understand, a good place to look for a powerful pointer to our real identity is the Christian concept of the Trinity (but you needn't become a Christian): three and yet one, one and yet three.<br /><br />Finally let me point out what seems at first sight a minor problem: Clarity claims in this book that thoughts arise directly out of Nothingness and that their origin is a total mystery. The point seems to be that mind is not an entity but a spontaneous and unconnected arising of \\"mental balloons\\" for which only unfathomable and unaccountable Oneness is responsible. The difficulty here is that if this were true \\"my\\" thoughts should be a mixture of all of mankind's thoughts and that each of us should be a random polyglot. Clearly, thoughts don't arise out of Pure Nothingness, but out of an individual memory, which reasserts itself all the time as long as there is no real wakefulness. It is important to see why this absurdity should appear in the doctrine: the aim is to persuade you that you ALREADY are nobody, that you ALREADY are in the state of egolessness and absolute anonymity, which means that whatever thought or desire arises is Oneness manifesting. See the danger?<br /><br />In conclusion, let me say that what one finds here seems to be one of the most deceptive petty bourgeois messages of cheap hope and comfort the world has ever heard. It beats Christianity and Buddhism by a long way by giving unattentive and gullible people a quick way of getting rid of guilt and agitation, ready-made and endless justifications for anything they may do and the promise that at death Liberation happens automatically regardless of one's actions.<br /><br />As antidotes to all the spurious \\"democratic spirituality\\" of neo-advaita, I recommend the following authors while reminding the reader that they too have their own limitations and dangers:<br /><br />Jiddu Krishnamurti. \\"The First and Last Freedom\\" is the best place to start, then read his wonderful \\"Commentaries on Living\\" and if you can get get hold of the book, read by all means his \\"Journal\\". Here you will find all the truths of neo-advaita without its apathetic mood and apolitical and amoral ideology.<br /><br />If you are a Christian or have Christian leanings, read \\"Self-Abandonment to DivineProvidence\\" by Jean-Pierre de Caussade, \\"Behold the Spirit\\" by Alan Watts (one of my favorite authors!) or \\"The Practice of the Presence of God\\" by Brother Lawrence. On ego and egolessness, read \\"The Reenchantment of the World\\" by Morris Berman.<br /><br />Or just put down all the books and be a light unto yourself. For me, the truth is between \\"ALREADY NO veils to be lifted \\" and \\"YET MORE veils to be lifted\\". Be free of time and thinking by seeing how they arise.<br /><br />Thank you for your kind attention.<br /><br />\\"The All must return to the One<br /><br />The One must return to the All.\\"<br /><br />(Zen aphorism)divorce between seeing and doing.

If you find Leibniz too hard to understand, a good place to look for a powerful pointer to our real identity is the Christian concept of the Trinity (but you needn't become a Christian): three and yet one, one and yet three.  <br /> <br />Finally let me point out what seems at first sight a minor problem: Clarity claims in this book that thoughts arise directly out of Nothingness and that their origin is a total mystery. The point seems to be that mind is not an entity but a spontaneous and unconnected arising of \\"mental balloons\\" for which only unfathomable and unaccountable Oneness is responsible. The difficulty here is that if this were true \\"my\\" thoughts should be a mixture of all of mankind's thoughts and that each of us should be a random polyglot. Clearly, thoughts don't arise out of Pure Nothingness, but out of an individual memory, which reasserts itself all the time as long as there is no real wakefulness. It is important to see why this absurdity should appear in the doctrine: the aim is to persuade you that you ALREADY are nobody, that you ALREADY are in the state of egolessness and absolute anonymity, which means that whatever thought or desire arises is Oneness manifesting. See the danger? <br /> <br />In conclusion, let me say that what one finds here seems to be one of the most deceptive petty bourgeois messages of cheap hope and comfort the world has ever heard. It beats Christianity and Buddhism by a long way by giving unattentive and gullible people a quick way of getting rid of guilt and agitation, ready-made and endless justifications for anything they may do and the promise that at death Liberation happens automatically regardless of one's actions.  <br /> <br />As antidotes to all the spurious \\"democratic spirituality\\" of neo-advaita, I recommend the following authors while reminding the reader that they too have their own limitations and dangers:  <br /> <br />Jiddu Krishnamurti. \\"The First and Last Freedom\\" is the best place to start, then read his wonderful \\"Commentaries on Living\\" and if you can get get hold of the book, read by all means his \\"Journal\\". Here you will find all the truths of neo-advaita without its apathetic mood and apolitical and amoral ideology.  <br /> <br />If you are a Christian or have Christian leanings, read \\"Self-Abandonment to Divine Providence\\" by Jean-Pierre de Caussade, \\"Behold the Spirit\\" by Alan Watts (one of my favorite authors!) or \\"The Practice of the Presence of God\\" by Brother Lawrence. On ego and egolessness, read \\"The Reenchantment of the World\\" by Morris Berman.  <br /> <br />Or just put down all the books and be a light unto yourself. For me, the truth is between \\"ALREADY NO veils to be lifted \\" and \\"YET MORE veils to be lifted\\". Be free of time and thinking by seeing how they arise.  <br /> <br />Thank you for your kind attention.  <br /> <br />\\"The All must return to the One  <br />The One must return to the All.\\"  <br />(Zen aphorism)	2005-05-11
US	27484262	R3UYC9HP1O44ZQ	0954779215	465411955	Awakening to the Dream: The Gift of Lucid Living	Books	1	110	164	N	N	Ophtalmolatry	Do, dear reader, the following experiment, one Leo Hartong's non-teacher Tony Parsons often has his hearers do during his workshops (but definitely isn't a form of self-inquiry a la Ramana Maharshi): close your eyes and stare into the dark and still void behind your ocular globes and ask yourself who is there...<br /><br />This is IT! This is what Tony and Leo want you to discover and which has apparently eluded countless generations of spiritual seekers throughtout the ages and under all latitudes because of their absurd desire for more and the \\"fireworks\\" of salvation or illumination. This is what you are, this is the Ultimate Mystery, hidden for long centuries of dark ignorance and now revealed jargon-free (but not free of charge!) by the non-teachers of what is nowadays called neo-advaita, a Macdonalized Anglo-Saxon version of the age-old Hindu advaita doctrine that denies the existence of real diversity in the Universe.<br /><br />Isn't that void within your skull perfectly still and indifferent? Isn't that void perfectly non-judgmental and impersonal? By Jove, it is! Therefore, you too are invited to drop all notions of right and wrong, all ideas of perfection and striving to become a mirror image of that perfect Nothingness devoid of any Will: the Divine Puppet. Since the space inside your head has apparently no Will and makes no judgments, this is what God and you as God must become and in fact already are. Constant change in a complex universe is occurring out there? Moral questions and choices are assailing you in the world? Urgent change and action to avert ecological disaster and cultural degeneration seem required? This is all an Illusion. The Dream. Awaken: ONLY this quiet thing within your skull is real.<br /><br />Now do another, somewhat longer experiment: like Leo's \\"master\\" and \\"personal\\" friend Tony Parsons or their archrival Eckhart Tolle, go to a park slowly (Tolle-like) but spontaneously (Tony-like) and sit there on a bench for a while. Stare with a blank mind at anything you like while repeating to yourself the imperishable verities of the School: \\"I am nobody\\", \\"there is nothing there\\", \\"there is nowhere to go\\", \\"there is only this!\\" If you do that persistently, chances are that you will soon experience yourself as an ex-orbitated non-presence watching a three-dimensional film. If you continue this non-practice (neo-advaita claims to be devoid of any spiritual practice!) and keep reading Leo's book every day \\"to remind yourself of your true nature\\", go to lectures by him or his friends, this state of not being there and of seeing life as a gigantic movie theater may become a more or less permanent fixture of your mental apparatus. Then you will be Cyclops All-Eye Nobody or already perfect Mr/Mrs.Oneness. In this state, there is apparently minimal friction and very little misery. And one, obviously, needn't do anything special or change anything: life is nothing more than a dream peopled with unreal characters. The only thing that is real is the detached seeing of the Cosmic Joke.<br /><br />This quiet and at times amused aloofness, coupled with a childish and irresponsible enjoyment of the glossy appearance of things is what is being offered here. There is nothing more to neo-advaita than living a cinemascope life of sanctified routine.<br /><br />As should be clear by now and also appears from the picture on the cover of this book, this is from beginning to end an optical illusion, an inflation of the eye, a Cyclopic form of myopia, one that was bound to arise in a culture which has become totally obsessed with pictures, screens and the sense of sight and has lost touch with the other senses, and more importantly, with intelligent reasoning.<br /><br />For intelligence will easily expose this fraud: reality isn't ALREADY perfect, which would make it static and purposeless, but constantly moving in a direction. What direction? In my opinion, it is moving toward Oneness. It is imperfect Love striving after perfect Love. And even after one has apparently attained Love and Oneness, one doesn't remain like a perfect, self-satisfied pool of limpid but stagnant water, but one keeps moving. Towards what? Moved by what? Moved by Love (not by egotic desire!)towards greater Love and Oneness, for Oneness is inexhaustible. Nobody, not even the most popular neo-advaitist teachers, possesses the whole of Oneness or Life, nobody is the whole truth, nobody is the whole path, for Path, Truth and Life are living and infinite.<br /><br />Rather than this unnameably mediocre stuff read Alan Watt's books on Taoism and Zen Buddhism. Better still, dig into his \\"Behold the Spirit\\", the most illuminating book I've ever read on the vexing question of the relationship between the One and the Many, the crucial question neo-advaita hasn't been able to solve. For those who have a strong philosophical bend, I recommend reading Leibniz and Spinoza. You may also take a look at Arthur Koestler's concept of \\"holon\\" in \\"The Ghost in the Machine\\" and \\"Beyond Reductionism\\", or read Morris Berman's masterful \\"Reenchantment of the World\\" on the cultural history of the ego sense. For Christians, I recommend the books of Jean-Pierre de Caussade and Brother Lawrence about the practice of \\"presence to God\\".<br /><br />For people who don't belong to any creed and are not looking for one, I recommend J. Krishnamurti, an author most neo-avaita teachers seem to have heavily borrowed  from, without ever citing him. Not that Krishnaji shares with neo-advaitists their core doctrine of \\"everything is already perfect\\". K. has no such dogma. Start with \\"The First and Last Freedom\\", continue with his delightful and profound \\"Commentaries on Living\\" and, if you can find it, read his austere mystical \\"Journal\\". I also love \\"Beginnings of Learning\\" and \\"Think about these Things\\". Listening to his conversations with American physicist David Bohm, the theorist of the \\"Implicit Order\\", or Religious Studies professor Allan W. Anderson may also prove enlightening.<br /><br />The shallowness of this thoroughly cerebral neo-advaita thing is stunning, but there is no question that it is highly seductive for people who are already highly cerebral and eye-oriented because of their cultural background and are consciously or unconsciously looking for a sanctified way of escape. The attractiveness of neo-advaita stems from its containing a great truth, which it unfortunately pursues without regard for the WHOLE truth, namely the (partial) truth of the Immanence of God. No false teaching can be attractive unless it contain some reflection of the truth, the whole truth being that the Source is both transcendent and immanent. Here and not here. In Love the tension is resolved, which leads to Compassionate Wisdom.<br /><br />Send food and tents to Africa. Or go there, preferably without your ego. Let your heart bleed.

Let me tell amazon.com customers candidly that my assessment of AS IT IS has varied considerably since I bought it and started reading it about three months ago, oscillating between boundless enthusiasm and bitter skepticism. Since I am now in a state of quiet and rather benevolent skepticism, my final rating will be three stars: this is a good book. But it could have easily been two stars (mediocre book) or four stars (very good book), depending on my mood. Let me also say that AS IT IS is a very difficult book to review, if only because its subject matter is the subtlest thing in the world: enlightenment, the ego-less \\"state\\" (with quotes because it is apparently NOT a state according to the specialists).<br /><br />AS IT IS is a very short work (about 140 pages) that could be read in less than half an hour. In fact, if one could really realize what is being said, the book could be put down almost instantly since its message is that enlightenment is not the result of time, which implies a total rejection of spiritual practice. If you have read J. Krishnamurti, this must sound familiar to you. But before I examine the contents of the book, let me say more about form.<br /><br />If you opened AS IT IS at random, what you would probably see is a black and white photograph on the left page and a short article on the right page. Halfway through the book, one comes across short conversations with so-called \\"spiritual seekers\\", apparently most of them older upper middle class people. Therefore Tony Parsons only wrote the first part of the book, the rest is just transcripts of question and answer dialogues.<br /><br />The short articles, with the longer pieces taking about three pages, are basically made up of terse sayings embodying a general truth about enlightenment, what is technically called \\"aphorisms\\". These aphorisms are grouped under one heading such as \\"Presence\\" or \\"Relationships\\"(the latter being the most disappointing entry in the whole book in my view). While the language is to a large extent jargon-free, it is not always easy to understand. I even feel that readers wholly unacquainted with such literature will find most of the book quite cryptic.<br /><br />Compared with other mystical and religious masterworks of the past and recent past such as Angelus Silesius' Cherubinic Wanderer, Khalil Gibran's \\"Prophet\\" or Jiddu Krishnamurti's \\"Commentaries on Living\\", to cite but a few highly recommended names, AS IT IS is a rather mediocre piece of writing, although it does contain some gems here and there. It is not free of sententiousness and obscurities and platitudes abound.<br /><br />One might ask why I make such comparisons. I make them because the publisher claims on the back cover of the book that AS IT IS was written \\"with an impersonal authority that emanates from absolute clarity\\", which is also what Tony says during his workshops. He even claims that while writing the book he attained \\"Total Liberation\\" (don't ask me what \\"Total Liberation\\" is, according to the specialists, it cannot be described and it happens to NOBODY, therefore add orthodox quotes where needed!). In plain English, this means that none less than GOD speaks in AS IT IS. I for one was accustomed to more beautiful prose from the Godhead. But then, for Tony Parsons, there is both \\"no God\\" and \\"God is no big deal\\", just plain \\"ordinary\\".<br /><br />Let us now leave aside form and turn to content. Given that the aim of the book is to explain the nature of enlightenment (\\"point to it\\" might be a better way of expressing it) as opposed to telling one HOW to attain it, did Tony Parsons, or rather Nameless Clarity, make a good job of it?<br /><br />To this question, dear reader, I can only give a disappointingly personal answer, the answer of someone who is moderately gifted, and hope that my personal experience may perchance reflect your own. My answer is that Unconditioned Oneness can be both confusing and enlightening, but perhaps more confusing thanenlightening. The fact is I am still confused about what enlightenment really is: is everything I experience enlightenment or is it something special? Is a blank mind, one that doesn't think, already in an enlightened state or at least \\"near to\\" it? I haven't found clear answers to these questions in this book (don't fret, Tony, other books haven't completely clarified these points for me either!).<br /><br />Part of the confusion and difficulty arises from the \\"doctrine\\" itself, a doctrine some have labeled \\"neo-advaita\\", new non-dualism: there is NO path to enlightenment, NOTHING one can do about it (because there is NO one in the first place) and understanding plays NO role in it. Tony even says that people had better forget his words when they leave his talks (but strangely enough he doesn't tell them they had better not come back!) and considers everything he says as \\"mere entertainment for the mind\\". In his dialogues, there is no meticulous clarification of concepts as one finds in Plato's or Berkeley's dialogues, but just short answers mostly of a negative nature: there are NO people, there is NO point in anything, you can't do anything about it, etc., etc.<br /><br />One can only hope that these awesome truths are realized instantly. If they aren't...If they aren't, Tony Parsons tells you that whatever you may do or think is just \\"divinely appropriate\\". To hear this is sometimes liberating, sometimes not. Somehow living AS THOUGH one was already awakened can be hard.<br /><br />The fact is one is not supposed to remember these \\"teachings\\" (with quotes because the specialists insist that advaita is NOT a teaching) or to ponder them because that would obviously be another path, and Path, Process and Practice, the three P's, is the absolute bete noire of neo-advaita. But one can listen again and again to Tony parsons' teachings LIVE. That is pointedly NOT a problem! Apparently nothing beats being with Tony's \\"flesh and bones\\". Apparently there is some kind of fluid or energy there that can help you, sorry not you but NOBODY.<br /><br />Isn't that puzzling in its own \\"divinely appropriate\\" way?<br /><br />Anyway, try your luck in this British enlightenment roulette (what else can you do?) and enjoy yourself if you can. My own educated guess is that AS IT IS will not by a long, long way be the last book you read about this strange beast called \\"enlightenment\\" and in case you already felt the need to find something \\"better\\" (with quotes because the specialists tell us that NOTHING is better than another thing), let me recommend \\"Already Awake\\" by Nathan Gill, a \\"disciple\\" (with quotes because...) of sorts of Tony's. He is far more explicit and articulate than \\"Tony\\" (with quotes because...) about the workings of the mind and may help...<br /><br />Guess whom NOBODY may help?<br /><br />PS: If you care, see also my more thorough and critical assessment of neo-advaita in my review of Tony Parsons' \\"Invitation to Awaken\\". A final recommendation: about ego and egolessness, \\"The Reenchantment of the World\\" by Morris Berman may provide you with useful insights and possible correctives to some of the errors found in neo-advaitist non-teachings.s more confusing than enlightening.

PS: If you care, see also my more thorough and critical assessment of neo-advaita in my review of Tony Parsons' \\"Invitation to Awaken\\". A final recommendation: about ego and egolessness, \\"The Reenchantment of the World\\" by Morris Berman may provide you with useful insights and possible correctives to some of the errors found in neo-advaitist non-teachings.	2005-05-07

There is no difference whatsoever between being asleep and being awake!<br />-Then, Tony, why are you here talking to us? What are you doing?<br />-I'm not here and I'm not saying anything. In fact, there is nobody here.<br />-Why are you charging nobody for hearing that everything is already fine as it is?<br />-Nobody is charging any fees. Nobody pays any fees. Nobody has ever paid any fees.<br />-Then we could leave this place and not pay you?<br />-Who can do that? There is nobody here! Nobody has ever done anything!<br />-I can certainly do that. Look, I'm now walking out of this room, as nobody maybe, without paying any fees and thereby refuting your sophistry...(leaves the room)<br /><br />This short and fictitious dialogue, dear reader, reflects better than a thousand words the whole content of Tony Parsons' message and at the same time reveals its utter absurdity. Although it doesn't appear as such in the book, it is perfectly plausible in the light of what is said here and elsewhere by this British living Buddha. One could also retell the famous story of the immature disciple who was told by his equally immature master that everything is Brahman: \\"Sarvam kalvidam brahman\\". The disciple walked out of the apparent room, started meditating on this great truth, saw an apparent huge elephant coming his way, didn't think it mattered at all, got trampled and seriously wounded. When he later asked his \\"master\\" what had gone wrong, he -had he apparently become wiser or was he just a clever fellow like Tony Parsons?-, just said: \\"Why didn't you listen to Brahman telling you to step aside through the voice of the elephant-driver?\\"<br /><br />I used to think that this message was an austere one of no hope. A Kali message of destruction, a work of ferocious but compassionate demolition of all misconceptions and illusions about our identity and religious practice. I now realize that it isn't. This is a cheap message of effeminate and ennervated bourgeois hope. What Tony negates, he recreates elsewhere; what he creates here, he negates there. In a way, the \\"non-teachings\\" are thus a perfect illustration of Tony's principle of universal neutralization.<br /><br />The reason why this is so is because the doctrine expounded here is based on the total and immediate \\"immanence\\" of God (Tony uses the word \\"God\\" quite a lot in his talks, while denying that He exists, usually he prefers the more neutral and possibly unintelligible term \\"oneness\\"). All there is IS Oneness. Everything as it is IS already perfect Oneness. Obviously, with such a dogma, one can't really deny anything nor bring about any radical transformation in Man or in the world.<br /><br />To see how this works, let us take the oft-repeated statement that \\"there is no one who has ever done anything\\". This at first sight sounds pretty negativistic and radical. But it isn't. Being nobody means in reality that you are ordinary God right now and for ever, no matter what you may feel, think or do. What the statement \\"I don't exist\\" really means is: \\"I'm not responsible for anything and I don't have to change\\".<br /><br />If neo-advaita was just an intellectual exercise in self-justification, it would not be more harmful than any of the other ineffective religions or ideologies that keep the world entertained. The big trouble is that it isn't just a cerebral game. What makes neo-advaita very dangerous is not just its thinly disguised apology of moral relativism and political apathy, but its creation of a pseudo-mystical state of non-presence. In other words, what Tony Parsons is offering you is not just a logorrhea, but a metaphysical experience. Aren't we fond of such things? I bet we all are. Specially if that experience can make us spiritual and moral balloonists for the rest of our dear lives.<br /><br />To understand how this is possible, do the following experiment: go slowly but spontaneously (for obviousreasons volition of any kind is taboo in neo-advaita) to a park and sit on a bench for a while. Stare quietly but nevertheless intently at anything you like while drumming into yourself the imperishable verities of the School: \\"NOOObody is sitting here\\", \\"there isn't AAAnything out there\\", \\"there is NOOOOthing to do\\", \\"I'm NOOOt going AAAAnywhere\\". After a while, and if you keep your eyes open and don't stop the self-indoctrination (both are absolutely essential ingredients in this process), chances are that you will start experiencing yourself as an ex-orbitated nonentity in the middle of a three-dimensional movie. Really. I've been through this.<br /><br />If you persist in this kind of (non)practice and keep going to lectures and meetings with Tony and his buddies Nathan Gill or Leo Hartong, this state of \\"not being there\\" may become a more or less permanent fixture of your mental life. You will become Cyclops All-Eye Nobody or Mr./Mrs. Already Perfect Oneness, and you won't need to open or close your eyes of illusory flesh any longer. You will continually feel like a seeing non-presence moving mechanically in the middle of an amusing but pointless movie.<br /><br />This of course will make \\"you/nobody\\" feel less tense and frictions will diminish. Worries about \\"your\\" destiny or that of the \\"world/dream\\" will evaporate, concern with pressing moral issues and politics will be reduced to nil, and pubs and caff&eacute;s will see a lot of \\"you/nobody\\". Meetings with the great nobodies like \\"divine puppet\\" Tony Parsons will also be attended frequently. To enjoy the nothingness and celebrate the divine game. To find the divinely appropriate but totally futile confirmation that all is well in the dream.<br /><br />Should you by chance-by chance only because you would no longer believe in silly things like going to Africa to distribute tents and food-, should \\"you\\" come across something disturbing, a man in need for example, chances will be that, far from thinking \\"I and he are one, therefore I will help him\\", \\"you\\" will rather remain in the automatic cinemascope mode, and think, \\"Oh, look, oneness pretending to be a man suffering\\". And you will walk by undisturbed and proud of being so: \\"Tony, this here wasn't tricked into going back in the dream: there was just a watching of pity arising and then falling back into nothingness. This loved the livid quality of the man's face though: a real work of artistry\\".<br /><br />Let me also say a few words about form. This book is a series of transcripts of conversations with so-called spiritual seekers, most of them older upper middle class people with a majority of depressed and unloved women, in different locations in New Age Mecca California and elsewhere. I used the word \\"conversations\\", but I shouldn't have because what you will find in this book are not real dialogues, people patiently and lovingly enquiring into the nature of truth, but a dreary ex cathedra course in neo-advaita metaphysics by someone who claims not only to reside in Absolute Clarity but to be Absolute Clarity itself.<br /><br />When one makes such extravagant claims about oneself, how can there be a \\"sharing among friends\\"? Clearly what you have here is a divine teacher lecturing his disciples. It is enough to compare Krishnmurti's conversations with seekers or Socrates' dialogues with his fellow Athenians to immediately see the huge difference between these wise men of the past and this superinflated British Kali avatar. There is no patient clarification of concepts taking place and the dialogues are just quick one question one answer exchanges. There is no slow walking together in the garden of truth, but an authoritative  shooting of \\"truths\\" at people, a foisting of absolute verities on them. This again is only a natural consequence of claiming that there is no path and that everything is already perfect as it is. Incantations and mantras are obviously the only form through which such a theory would express itself: take it or leave it NOW!<br /><br />One (proud)claim that one often finds in Tony's talks is that he is offering people NO hope at all. Let me say that this is simply NOT true at all. The fundamental hope that is hidden in this message is that when one dies, Liberation, the definitive absorption in Pure Being, happens instantly, definitively and most important of all, AUTOMATICALLY regardless of what you may have done during your life. In other words, Stalin, John Paul II and you will become enlightened no matter what at death! The problem here is not just that Tony is denying right and wrong, but that he is subtly but unmistakably reviving the good old dualism of soul and body, for the logical conclusion of preaching automatic Illumination at death must be that embodiment, flesh is the ultimate cause of Illusion!<br /><br />Another tremendous hope that is generated by these teachings is that of attaining enlightenment. The man keeps hinting that \\"there are people in this room who are no longer people\\", that \\"enlightenment may happen this evening at 9:30\\", that \\"the awakenings that are taking place all over the place now are just incredible\\", \\"Give me a ring when it happens\\", etc., etc. Although Tony keeps saying that this can't be done by one (because there is no one!) and that enlightenment is not an event, he is speaking about enlightenment and liberation all the time. It is true that he, unlike many people, doesn't describe these transformations as extraordinary events that make one blissful and all powerful for the rest of one's life. He himself has apparently no powers of healing or clairvoyance (and derides such things), but he nevertheless claims to emanate a special fluid that helps \\"nobody\\" to realize they are nobody.  All these things must not only create authority and a dependency-riddled guru-disciple relationship, but also tremendous anticipation and desire.<br /><br />There seems to be a kind of blindness or lack of lucidity on the part of Tony about his own teachings, a lack of consistency, which is surprising for someone who modestly claims to reside in \\"Absolute Clarity\\". One also finds traces of dogmatism in his harsh critique of other teachers, Ramesh Balsekar (\\"there's a guy in Bombay who says that those who don't care about enlightenment are in fact nearest to it\\"), Eckhart Tolle and Andrew Cohen being his favorite targets. Anyone who dares to suggest even subliminally that you are someone with free choice is a sort of heretic, someone who speaks from \\"total confusion\\" or \\"deep ignorance\\". In order not to sound intolerant and sectarian, Tony is careful to immediately add that spreading \\"confused teachings\\" is \\"divinely appropriate\\", but the way in which he delivers his attacks on other spiritual instructors undermines in my view the sincerity of his more benign claims.<br /><br />A very disturbing aspect of this teaching is its apology of absolute irresponsability. Since he is nobody and the world of social relationships a total Cosmic Joke/Dream, Tony can't be held responsible for anything he says. He is impersonal Oneness manifesting and everything he says and does must bear the stamp of absolute inevitability. To take another example, in neo-advaita, one would no longer be able to indict a politician for telling lies to the public because he is nobody, because he is not there in the first place. The alleged lies come out directly of nothingness and they can't be described as real lies since there is no right and wrong but only perfectly neutral is-ness.<br /><br />Isn't it frightening to hear such things and to know that Tony Parsons encourages people to think of themselves and of others that way?<br /><br />Finally let me point out an aspect of the \\"message\\" that is often overlooked: what is being dished out here isn't a highly spiritual doctrine rooted in the vedantic tradition of India, but a crude form of materialistic monism. This is specially obvious if one examines Tony's repeated claims about the total lack of purpose of the Universe. Now this is precisely the thesis of modern science, which is based on atheism and materialism: the world is utterly devoid of meaning. When there is only matter (Oneness!), nothing matters...<br /><br />I recommend as a corrective to the patent moral relativism and apathetic a-political mood that pervades Tony's books to read Jiddu Krishnamurti. Start with \\"The First and Last Freedom\\". Here is a really austere message that doesn't make cheap claims about the hereafter and doesn't encourage sloth and indifference. If you are still interested in neo-advaita, reading Nathan Gill's \\"Already Awake\\" may help you to understand neo-advaita better because Nathan, who is a disciple of sorts of Tony's, is much more precise, systematic and clear in his description of the workings of awakening, whereas, as I explained above, Tony tends to remain at the level of unexplained negative formulas.<br /><br />You could also read the Gospel of John or Thomas with fresh eyes, try Alan Watts' \\"The Book: On the Taboo against Knowing Who You Are\\" or Leibniz' \\"Monadology\\", or simply listen to the birds in your garden (WHO is listening?).<br /><br />Thank you for your attention.lf: take it or leave it NOW!<br /><br />One (proud)claim that one often finds in Tony's talks is that he is offering people NO hope at all.

Books	3	7	13	N	N	The best of what Eckhart Tolle has to say	The first time I listened to these tapes, they had a profound effect on me. It seems to me that on listening to E.T. I had a foretaste of the stillness he is speaking about several times. This is the reason why, although I now consider E.T. a third class advaita teacher, I am still willing to recommend this interview to people here on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The first part of the interview, which was recorded on September 11 is about the tragedy itself and the meaning of human suffering, the nature of enlightenment, the search for truth and self-knowledge. E.T. says here a number of things which are quite profound and true. The second tape, which was recorded several weeks later, is about E.T. himself, how he became awakened and how he now lives (his mind activity has been reduced by 80%). He also speaks of the wave of enlightenment today, of the uncertain future of the planet and of past masters, whom he beautifully calls \\"early flowers\\".<br /><br />Although I can think of lots of much more interesting questions to ask an enlightened person than \\"are you a mutant?\\", the interviewer does a good job in the sense that she remains unobstrusive during the whole conversation, which is in fact a kind of monologue.<br /><br />So this is definitely an interesting work. The quality of the sound is impeccable and there are no noisy and disturbing outbursts of laughter from the audience as in \\"Realizing the Power of Now\\". Hence maybe its quite hypnotic effect.<br /><br />Having said that, I have become quite dissatisfied with the teachings of E.T., specially as they are set forth in the books and in \\"Realizing the Power of Now\\" and therefore recommend that you also buy \\"As It Is\\" by Tony Parsons in order to compare what these two supposedly awakened human beings have to say. I think that Tony's message is simpler and less misleading than that of Eckhart, who insists on having you practice awareness and other dualistic stuff one finds in religious traditions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as far as pure non dualism is concerned, \\"Even The Sun Will Die\\" is by and large free of the cheap traditional teachings found in Tolle's other \\"productions\\". This is why I still recommend it to you.<br /><br />Bon voyage!concerned, \\"Even The Sun Will Die\\" is by and large free of the cheap traditional teachings found in Tolle's other \\"productions\\".

Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.<br /><br />Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called \\"not seeing the forest because of the trees\\".<br /><br />If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.<br /><br />As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.<br /><br />Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.<br /><br />Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...clusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble!

And it is definitely not the complete programme of lectures of a week-long retreat since many concepts handled by Tolle in the course of his speeches have never been explained before.<br /><br />What you will find here is a quite commonsensical mixture of Zen quotes, Christian meditations, all too predictable recommendations to be aware and to accept \\"what is\\" and jokes about human silliness, all of this interspersed with the sound of Bali bells, supposedly meaningful silences, outbursts of noisy laughter and the heavy sound of E.T.'s breathing.<br /><br />Somehow I find that E.T., whose books I have all read and studied, has been corrupted by the enlightenment industry or the \\"enlightenment club\\". I have a feeling that he is now increasingly playing a role and trying to conform to people's expectations about what a spiritual teacher should look and sound like. His slow manner of speaking seems terribly contrived, almost calculated to create a state of hypnosis in his hearers. There is affectation in everything he says.<br /><br />I found the content of \\"Realizing the Power of Now\\" boring, shallow and repetitive. If you really want to follow E.T., I recommend \\"Even the Sun Will Die\\" instead. \\"Even the Sun Will Die\\" is an interview with Tolle made on September 11. In it, Eckhart develops a number of rather profound ideas and relates his own adventure. It is much more interesting than this insipid stuff for mass consumption about awakening.<br /><br />I recommend Jiddu Krishnamurti, who is both a profound \\"thinker\\" and a delightful English prose writer (read his \\"Commentaries on Living\\"). But no matter who your \\"teacher\\" is, I think it is essential not to accept anything just because he says it. All teachings are dangerous and misleading because words are by definition misleading.

The authors not only reveal the existence of this sexual wonder, but also explain to you, on the basis of age-old Chinese Taoist techniques, how to have it. The emphasis is on practical knowledge. They also explain how detrimental to your health ejaculation is and this is supposed to be a strong incentive to try the techniques.<br /><br />I have learnt a lot about male (and female)anatomy and sexuality from the book and I certainly found the techniques fascinating. Nevertheless when I put it down, I decided not to try all the tricks because<br /><br />1. They are too complicated and not explained very clearly<br /><br />2. There is no possibility to ask questions to the author and I have no Taoist instructor at hand (have you?)<br /><br />3. The techniques are dangerous (the description of the main technique called the big draw is followed by almost two pages of possible dangers and pitfalls)<br /><br />Mantak Chia also discusses gay sexuality but the chapter on gay love is very disappointing. Just a few trite remarks on Taoism being non-judgmental and having a medical, not a moral, approach to sexuality. And none of this backed by quotes from the Taoists books. One wonders if the gay thing is not just a cheap ruse to enlarge the readership of the book...<br /><br />There is very little in the Multi-Orgasmic Man on the theory of male multiple orgasms: how it happens and why. Very little also on what MMO means for anthropology, philosophy and religion. Did the ancients know about it? The author speaks of old Chinese techniques,but doesn't explore the history of MMO in other cultures. All in all, this is a very superficial study and vulgarity is not absent from its pages(\\"touch your balls\\").<br /><br />As most how-to books on ancient exotic techniques, I guess there are very few readers who will actually use them. And considering the dangers involved, maybe this is better...them. And considering the dangers involved, maybe this is better...	2005-01-31

I know that Jaroslav Pelikan gives intellectual peak experiences to some people, but the fact is that he bores me terribly. There is no doubt in my mind that the man is a first-rate erudite who has read thousands of books, but he is a very bad writer, with no style at all. His prose is impeccable but the way he tells you things is dry, dry, dry. Never a note of playfulness, never an interesting anecdote. It's simply unbearable, or only bearable for monks who want to do penance.<br /><br />Although I was deeply interested in the subject and am accustomed to reading big books (I have read Robert Eisenman's huge volume on James, the Brother of Jesus), I couldn't go beyond the third chapter...<br /><br />Note that the scope of this book is very limited: pagan natural theology and Christian Cappadocian natural theology.

There are excellent drawings for the dummies (buying a dildo in addition to the book will make it definitely easier to learn all the great hand jobs). Most of the book deals with things you do with your body: kissing, hand jobs, fellatio (oral sex), positions, etc. There is a chapter on sex toys and one on STDs. The tricks and techniques which are not physical (clothing, perfumes, etc.) are also covered but you will find more on this particular field of interest in \\"203 Ways to Drive a Man Wild in Bed\\" by Olivia St.Claire.<br /><br />While Paget's approach is quite straightforward and focuses on techniques, she makes it very clear from the start that she favors the traditional sexual ethics. The whole discussion is based on the assumption that one has only one sexual partner (ie your beloved husband) and that the goal is life-long faithfulness. She does speak of her gay friend Brian but there are no references to gay sex in the book. It's all for straight couples. Another feature of the book is that it contains no hot stories to whet your desire to try the techniques and no \\"extreme\\" practices, although anal sex is also described and recommended.<br /><br />Lou Paget basically teaches you to make love-making an art and to be slow, imaginative and careful, which is great. The language is elegant and not vulgar throughout, an outstanding quality in my view.<br /><br />My only (strong) reservation concerns the chapter on STDs, which fails to tell readers the whole truth about AIDS. That a virus named HIV causes the complex of diseases conveniently labeled \\"AIDS\\" is only an hypothesis, and one that (in my view)has been successfully challenged by competent virologists such as Peter Duesberg of Berkeley University (on this read \\"Inventing the AIDS virus\\"). Recreational drugs, not sex, may be the real cause of all the trouble!

I was sorely disappointed. This thin book presents a series of short theological articles dealing with the Trinity, Eschatology and Ecclesiology. There is also an article on the Imago Dei. Hence the title of the book.<br /><br />When I read these articles I often put down the book and asked myself: what did I learn from what I've just read ? And believe me or not: I was absolutely incapable of remembering a single notable idea! Lossky seems to have caught the virus of French intellectuals, talking endlessly and without contributing anything substantial or interesting about extremely technical matters such as the difference between the trinity according to Clement of Alexandria and the trinity according to Dyonisius the Areopagite. Are you interested, dear reader? I'm not.<br /><br />The article about the Imago Dei was extremely disappointing and seems to have been written with a view to please the Protestant intelligentsia: in it, we learn that according to Scripture the image of God is indeed nothing more that the capacity of man to dominate nature. There are more developments in the rest of the article since the Orthodox don't accept \\"sola scriptura\\", but the final result is quite unoriginal, to put it very mildly.<br /><br />\\"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church\\" is worth your time and money but this collection of essays isn't, unless of course you happen to be a hair-splitting scholar who relishes high theological abstractions with ecumenical overtones.	2004-12-28
US	27484262	R170XKP8AI95AN	3861871637	879190193	Jagged Youth	Books	1	8	15	N	N	Very disappointing	I suppose you are not looking for any hot stuff and that you are already familiar with Roffman's black-and-white photography art, so that I don't need to insist on the fact that what you have here is very, very soft gay porn. In fact I wouldn't call it porn at all because no sexual activity, neither solo nor in couple, is shown in this thin album.<br /><br />\\"Jagged Youth\\" is in my view the least interesting and rewarding of all albums by Roffman. The reasons are simple: the models are more than just ordinary and the album is just too short. If I am not mistaken, there are no more than five models in this collection. All of them are in their early twenties, some may be even younger. They are just plain boys you could meet anywhere. Not that I like supermodels who look perfect, but this time not even Roffman's technique could enhance their features.<br /><br />I recommend Roffman's album on Johan Paulik and \\"Perfect Boys\\" instead of \\"Jagged Youth\\". \\"Peter and Petr\\" is quite repetitive and not really worth the money even though the two models are beautiful. My favorite is \\"Sebastian and Friends\\", by the same publisher, a thick album packed with really erotic pictures in color of Sebastian Bonnet and other Bel Ami models.	2004-12-28

The exercises should be done twice a day and last about 25 minutes.<br /><br />Most of the book, however, is about how important it is for you to look young and attractive. I wish the author had spent more time explaining the techniques. True, there are photographs (of a man who doesn't have to care about wrinkles and sagging face muscles), but the explanations that accompany the photographs are insufficient. You will need to try the exercices and practice them for a while before you really understand how to do them. The techniques are simple but still you will have to figure out how to apply them.<br /><br />I also warn readers that most of the exercices involve visualisations and gestures that are supposed to stir the subtle energies of the body (what the Chinese call \\"Chi\\", the mysterious fluid acupuncturists work on with their needles). So if you are allergic to New Age stuff or your ability to concentrate and imagine things is very poor, you may have trouble using the techniques described in this book.<br /><br />One issue Carole Maggio doesn't talk about is the problem of the lines that may appear as a result of training. Briefly, there is plenty of serious stuff that should have been treated and just isn't.	2004-11-25

This is not a dry factual description, though: the style is lively and the whole story, as retold by Rubenstein, is simply engrossing and very easy to read.<br /><br />Since one reviewer below has challenged the theological accuracy of this book, let me point out for people who care about such matters that \\"When Jesus became God\\" gives an absolutely accurate description of both Arian and Athanasian theology. Rubenstein has read all the authorities on the controversy and while some fanatic Trinitarians may be shocked to hear something positive about Arius'views of God and Christ, the fact is that Rubenstein doesn't distort anybody's position. To claim that he has is downright slanderous.<br /><br />\\"When Jesus became God\\" is full of extremely interesting facts, things one doesn't hear much about since Orthodoxy crushed the Arian movement: as we all know, history telling belongs to the victors. How many of us for example know that the biggest oecumenical council was Arian? That not just haughty aristocrats and soldiers but barbers and shopkeepers sided with Arius?<br /><br />I have only one regret: the book hasn't much to say about the Arian church itself, its rituals, the organisation of its clergy, etc. One doesn't really come to feel what it meant to be an Arian in the fourth century AD. I also regret not having found more information on the development of the Arian church among the barbarians, specially the Wisigoths. The book focuses primarily on the East and the long struggle between the two sides until Theodosius put an end to the Arian heresy in his empire. The fierce debate between Arius and Athanasius takes up about one third of the book, most of it is devoted to the aftermath of the Council of Nicea.<br /><br />This is an excellent book.

Now in Dunn's book you will find something similar, but this time it is Paul who becomes the 'victim' of this process of Judaization. If I had to summarize the thesis of this ponderous treatise on Pauline theology I would say that Paul was a Jew and that he remained a Jew in his theology. This means among other things that he never taught that Jesus was God.<br /><br />The book is highly readable with little technical jargon and high-strung phrases, but people who don't have a thorough knowledge of Paul will find to their annoyance that most of the time Dunn doesn't quote in full the passages he is analysing. So keep your Bible on hand to check all the references and read them carefully before you turn to Dunn's comments.<br /><br />The author gives one a good and very practical overview of all the major themes of Pauline theology with chapters on \\"Justification by faith\\" (the longest one), \\"The Pre-existent Christ\\", \\"Jesus the Man\\" (on the relationship between Paul and the pre-resurrection Jesus), etc. The hot topic of the divinity of Jesus, for which I basically bought the book since I am extremely interested in Christology, is also discussed, but Dunn's comments are very simple and short: the whole analysis covers less than two pages and the conclusion is that Paul was a thorough Jewish monotheist who did call Jesus \\"Lord\\" but din't teach that he was God the Son. There is also a lot of emphasis on Adamic theology: the approach that sees Jesus primarily as the \\"New Adam\\". It is for example in the light of Genesis and Adam that Dunn explains the meaning of the hotly debated Christological hymn in Philippians 2.<br /><br />I would say that while it is certainly useful to have a book that covers the whole range of Pauline theology, \\"The Theology of Paul the Apostle\\" failed to meet my expectations on several accounts. My main criticism is that what Dunn has to say is most of the time quite unoriginal and even trite. The topics are all of them quite conventional: I would have loved a chapter on Pauline ecology or some other less obvious aspect of his thinking, more on mysticism, but Dunn's approach is very rational and mainly sociological in its thrust. The tone and style is thoroughly academic and on sensitive issues Dunn keeps a low profile and is always soft spoken: don't expect vitriolic tirades &agrave; la Robert Eisenman!<br /><br />Many of the author's comments are fuzzy and strangely unconclusive. He also seems eager to present a picture of Paul which is free of error and contradictions. There is no critical assessment of Paul's arguments, the whole analysis is purely descriptive and strictly theological with very little biographical material (people who want to read about Paul the man should not order this book). There are lots of linguistic explanations, which are certainly enlightening, but after understanding the meaning of the terms used by Paul, one expects something more, and this is what Dunn fails to provide in my view in many cases. A basic knowledge of koine Greek, while not indispensable, will help you better understand some of the chapters in this book.<br /><br />I like the book, it is practical, but on the whole I didn't learn much from it and it is quite insipid.

The author's prose is sometimes difficult to read and stuffed with naval jargon but on the whole quite enjoyable. In fact, the narrative is gripping and comparable with the best historical novels.<br />What I also find commendable about this book is its relative neutrality. Because it opens with a chapter praising Queen Elizabeth, I was afraid that it would be flagrantly and outrageously pro-Brittish but as the story unfolded the author was able to present each actor in a quite objective way and even the defeat of the Spanish fleet was not as heart-rending as I had feared (I have a lot of Spanish blood in my veins!).<br />The Armada focuses on political and military events rather than on a colorful historical reconstruction of details. The book contains no lengthy descriptions of clothes or weapons or dietary habits or a social critique of the 16th century. What you do find is a wealth of acute psychological portraits of the main characters (but thank God without any Freudian undertones!). Elizabeth I, Philip II, Drake and Medina Sidonia, the Spanish admiral, are all described incisively along with Henri III, the Duke of Guise, Mary, the queen of Scots, and other minor actors.<br />The only thing I regret about The Armada is the sore lack of illustrations: pictures of the different vessels used in combat and of their armament would have been most welcome. True, there are two maps at the beginning of the book and they are enough to understand the narrative, but still my imagination was hampered by my ignorance of what pinnaces and galleasses look like.<br />All in all an excellent book. If you love 16th century history this is the book for you.	2004-06-16

Please do not misunderstand the provocative title of my comment: I am not saying that this book is worthless and that you should avoid buying it.<br />On the contrary, I think that Wallace's grammar is an invaluable work worth every dollar you spend for it. First of all, unlike other grammars, this one is as thrilling as a detective novel. Of course, unless you are deeply interested in NT exegesis, you will probably find Wallace's huge treatise anything but gripping. But if like me you are an impassioned reader of the Gospel and its original text, you will surely love this book.And the good news is that it is not for advanced learners of koine Greek only. In fact I started using it with minimal knowledge of Greek and I have little doubt that a complete stranger to the language of Luke and Paul could also glean immensely useful information from its pages provided he be a serious student of the Scriptures.<br />Having said that I must warn potential buyers and readers that Wallace is not an objective grammarian and linguist at all. Unlike a real scientist, he does not put aside his own religious and philosophical convictions aside and look at the NT dispassionately. What he does almost sistematically is to advance his own Protestant views of Christ and atonement and other crucial points with the help of Greek grammar. Fortunately, he does state the opinion of scholars who disagree with him but he gives them minimal space. Most of the time he does not even quote them!<br />A perfect example of Wallace's bias is the discussion on the use of the prepositions &quot;uper&quot; and &quot;anti&quot; in relation to the question of atonement. He mentions the fact that W.Bauer translates these prepositions by &quot;on behalf of&quot; rather than  by &quot;instead of&quot; but he does not illustrate or expatiate on Bauer's point of view. Instead the reader is presented with several pages of arguments in favor of his own opinion, so that the naive reader may end up thinking that the translation favored by respected scholars like Bauer has no solid ground under it. And that is only one example among many, many others.<br />Of course, one could argue that many dubious points of Greek grammar simply cannot be cleared without a previous choice and that all exegesis must involve a certain amount of eisegesis. This may be true but Wallace really goes too far. Does he write for only for his small chapel? Aren't there Catholics and eastern Orthodox and Jews out there too?<br />Strangely enough this is a BCE(before common era)/CE(common era)book. Does Wallace not realize that these acronyms are basically anti-Christian and contribute to the secularization of our culture?<br />I say to all Christian authors: FOR GOD'S SAKE USE BC AND AD !!!<br />So my advice to you is: buy this grammar. But be sure to buy another one to know the two sides of the Biblical coin.t the translation favored by respected scholars like Bauer has no solid ground under it.

This is because what Belloc writes and how he writes it is so novel, refreshing, clear and shocking that you simply cannot be the same man after reading his works.<br />Don't expect a book full of quotes and references to primary sources with an imposing bibliography at the back. There isn't a single quote or reference to a primary or secondary source in any of the books by Belloc that I've read.<br />Briefly, you will have to take Belloc's word for it that things really happened the way he says they did. The man doesn't really put forward arguments, he simply states his case. And it works! For some, specially people who don't have a conservative mindset or who take methodology very seriously, this will probably be considered a major flaw and they will dismiss Belloc's works as mere propaganda but I didn't bother: I was completely absorbed by his quick and fascinating narrative and mind-blowing historical analysis.<br />Belloc is not a historian who likes to recreate a historical period by giving the reader a wealth of details about clothing, dietary habits and what not. No, his view is a tend thousand feet view: the main events, the underlying causes, the far-reaching consequences. Everything is said with utmost clarity and almost bluntly: the Reformation was a catastrophe for European civilization and its main driving force was rapacity.<br />In How the Reformation Happened, Belloc covers the whole period from immediately before AD 1517, when Luther published his theses, to the reign of Louis XIV. This is a long period for a book of less than 150 pages but as I said above Belloc is only interested in the quintessence of history. He leaves aside all the chaff and gives you only the grain.<br />This book deals only with events and does not go into the doctrinal issues. For this read Belloc's short book on heresies \\"The Great Heresies\\" and on the enemies of the Church \\"Survivals and New Arrivals\\".<br />The pace of the narrative is breathtaking but always crystal clear and studded with thought-provoking reflections. Since most of us have been spoon-fed a Protestant and anti-Catholic version of history, most of what he says will appear quite novel but his writing is so cogent that you will end up being convinced. I was for example completely taken aback by his explanation of the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre in AD 1572 .<br />This book is an eye-opener and a page-turner. And a source of true philosophy...es.

The architects wanted to show that London, now capital of the most powerful nation in Europe, was the new (reformed) Jerusalem.<br />Well, let me tell you that the book is more a history of Hermeticism, the Reformation and English politics than a real in-depth study of occult meanings in architecture. As English history was almost totally unknown to me before I read this book, I was delighted to learn so many interesting things about John Wycliffe, Queen Elizabeth and  her magus John Dee, and the many legends about the origin of the English people.<br />I began to get bored halfway through the book when the author started to write endless chapters about the Rosicrucian movement and its symbolism. We are apprised that a pamphlet or a booklet about a mysterious society was published in such and such a year and that the illustration on the cover refers to such and such mythological episode but nothing tangible happens.<br />Adrian Gilbert is on the whole a good writer and his English clear and quite polished but he has a knack of writing things that go round and round and lead nowhere. He take a little clue here and there, suggests a possible meaning and then goes off in a new direction. He is very careful to end each chapter in a way that keeps the reader in suspense but as nothing really interesting or mind-blowing ever materializes, one quickly realizes that one is being fooled with cheap literay tricks.<br />Finally, at the end of what amounts to a huge digression, he relates his discoveries about the hidden plan of the New Jerusalem. These finds are few in number and not really interesting. Many are incomprehensible unless one is a mathematician or an astrologer. No clear conclusion is drawn from what has been found and the final impression is one of an unfinished piece of homework (is Gilbert trying to build up a suspense for his next book, one wonders).<br />It was hard for me to finish the book and although I was grateful for all the knowledge I gained about the 16th and 17th centuries, I felt somewhat disappointed.omework (is Gilbert trying to build up a suspense for his next book, one wonders).<br />It was hard for me to finish the book and although I was grateful for all the knowledge I gained about the 16th and 17th centuries, I felt somewhat disappointed.	2004-02-16

Erasmus receives special attention and both his works and the correspondence between him and More is treated at great length. Luther is another important character, along with other Reformation figures.<br />The author describes meticulously the content of More's main works starting with his account of the life of Richard III and ending with the treatise on death he wrote when he was imprisoned in the Tower. Each book is analysed in depth both as to its philosophical, theological and political import and as a reflection of More's character and beliefs. In fact, the discussion of More's literary production takes up about half the book, so that \\"Thomas More: A Biography\\" could appropriately be renamed \\"Thomas More's Literary Career\\".<br />Another reviewer has torn into this biography, accusing Marius of \\"deconstructionism\\". At first I found that Marius's view of Thomas More was surprisingly free of many modern prejudices. Let us not forget that More is a man who should be thouroughly repellent to any liberal scholar: he persecuted heretics relentlessly. He seemes to have been what we now call a religious fanatic, a XVIth century version of Khomeini.<br />Now, except for the odd passage, there are no such cynical or condescending remarks as one often finds under the pen of many modern historians when discussing the Middle Ages or Catholicism in this biography. Sometimes I even suspected that Marius might be a crypto-Catholic, for he shows more than disinterested objectivity in his treatment of the causes that More passionately espoused. Sometimes he even vents his repulsion for some Protestant doctrines or the behavior of More's adversaries, describing for example the King at the time of his infatuation with Anne Boleyn as \\"a boar in rut\\" and the woman herself as \\"a strumpet\\".<br />But when I finished the book I was struck by the fact that it had left in my mind a rather negative image of Sir Thomas More. In any case, I didn't think he deserved to be considered as a saint by the Church. In his depiction of him, Marius seems to focus more on the somber aspects of his personality and he certainly doesn't dwell on the likeable or admirable ones.He goes even so far as to compare him with the hateful Torquemada.<br />Marius provides a general psychological explanation for More's course of action. It is not specially far-fetched or outrageous, just slightly Freudian: More, says Marius, was obsessed with death and fought against his own sexual drives, traits which were common enough among his contemporaries. Fortunately, Marius does not dwell heavily on his psychological theories and when he does attempt an explanation, refrains from using any pseudo-pschoanalytic jargon.<br />\\"Thomas More: A Biography\\" is specially valuable for the light it throws on the doctrinal issues that were at the center of the Reformation and I gained many an insight from Marius'clear and profound reflections. The only thing which I found lacking is a detailed description of political events, economic life(More lived in an age of three-digit inflation!)civilization and daily life in 16th century England but then the book might easily have been twice as long. To put it briefly, this biography is more a discussion of ideas than of events, which is understandable since More was a rather second-rate political figure (at least this is how he appears in this work).<br />What one will not find either in this book is evocative descriptions of XVIth century London or of King Henry's court. You will not be apprised here of the name of More's dog or find a description of the furniture of his house. Marius doesn't try to recreate the age with a wealth of details: he focuses on More, his books, and on the religious issues and controversies of the time.<br />The book is long and does contain a few lengthy and dull passages, especially in the beginning and when Marius goes in great detail into More's books and correspondence but the narrative gets more and more interesting toward the end. One aspect of the book which I found confusing is the author's inability to tell us what was the real state of public opinion in More's time. He often says that the English people were fiercely anticlerical but also states that they were overwhelmingly for Catherine of Aragon and against the Henry's divorce. To me this seems to be a blatant contradiction. Apparently, Marius has failed to make a distinction between the intelligentsia and the popular classes and between London and the rest of the country.<br />All in all, I still think that this is a worthy book. I don't think Marius could have been more sympathetic to More without sounding as a Catholic hagiographer. In addition to it and for people who want a more Catholic view of the period, I recommend Hilaire Belloc's books on the Reformation.

Page numbers and location of the examples read are given on the recording.<br />The speaker is a youg woman with no American accent whatsoever. She must be an Isreali. At times she seems to be slightly bored with what she is doing but on the whole her performance is quite satisfactory.<br />This is an excellent introduction to the sound of ancient Hebrew and I highly recommend it. I gave it only four stars because the producers should have added a male voice.	2004-01-26

Contrary to the infamous and inordinately expensive \\"Readings in Biblical Hebrew\\", another intermediate level Hebrew manual you may have heard of, Hebrew Step by Step II includes the Hebrew text.<br />Students will find that it has the same strong points and weaknesses as the first volume. It is very user-friendly inasmuch as you get lots of study hints from the author; photographs from the good old times enliven the text; the amount of exercises is kept to a reasonable level, offering the student what I'd call \\"Hebrew Snacks\\". Briefly, this is a manual with a reassuring feeling of homeliness about it.<br />The only major problem that I see, apart from the usual messiness of the explanations and lack of clear charts, is the size of the Hebrew font, which is painfully small. To make matters worse, the Biblical text is reproduced with all the minute reading symbols of the Biblia Stuttgartensia.<br />Conclusion: equip yourself with a good magnifying glass if you aregoing to use this manual. If your eyesight is pretty poor, I recommend the First Hebrew Reader by EKS instead. Their font is HUGE.	2004-01-23

(Francois Rabelais, c. 1494-1553, Gargantua and Pantagruel, bk. II, 8)<br />As a child in his late thirties, I used to read Harry Potter every time I took a plane back home. His adventures would help me to kill time during the 9 hours flight to Europe. I must say I enjoyed the first volume of the series enormously, although I was disappointed by the denouement, which I found both laborious and quite predictable.<br />The next year, I spent a couple of pleasant hours with the second volume too, but already most of the novelty was gone. I found that Rowling was quite unable to find new humorous details to lend a magical and poetic atmosphere to her narrative like the living photographs, the owl messengers etc., that had contributed so much to the charm of the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\". The end of the story resembled that of the first volume in its predictability and complicated clumsiness.<br />The third volume as it were brought all Rowling's weaknesses as a writer to a head, something I suspected when I noticed that the book was thicker that the preceding volumes. To tell the whole truth, I didn't bother to read the last chapter because I was thoroughly bored with the book and I left it on the floor of the plane. Needless to say, I didn't buy any more books by Rowling to enliven my following plane trips.<br />What is wrong with the prisoner of Azkaban?<br />My greatest criticism concerns the plot: it is so complicated that in the end the author is obliged to resort to the worst of all literary tricks: she has the characters explain the whole thing to the reader. This happens near the end of the book when the whole bunch is gathered in a haunted house in Hogsmeade, the wizarding village across the lake from Hogwart. I got completely lost in the lengthy and convoluted stories of the characters and came to the conclusion that Rowling was simply a bad writer running out of steam.<br />The Prisoner of Azkaban is totally devoid of freshness and magic, it is a 100% deja vu thing. As a matter of fact, the atmosphere of the whole story is rather gloomy and dark. Clearly what you have here is an adult's world, not a children's world. It is also in keeping with what the author has said about the series, that it would become darker and darker...<br />Other reviewers (for I am not the only one who finds this book a piece of rubbish !)have pointed to the use of a time machine by Hermione as a major flaw in the plot and I agree with them. In the previous episodes, I had also found Harry's invisibility clothes to be a kind of \\"deus ex machina\\" which made things just too easy for Rowling to round off her plot.<br />I really had the impression that Rowling was writing just to sustain her reputation and keep the whole hugely lucrative Harry Potter circus going, while hammering the whole dubious witchcraft thing into her young readers'brains: the same oversimplified characters with the same stereotyped reactions, the same endless Quidditch matches, the same dreary mineral settings (talk of a book that brings children closer to nature!), the same laboured denouement. It is a routine! But it must be a highly hypnotic routine otherwise...how cold one explain the Hary Potter cult?<br />What I find specially disappointing is Rowling's inability to describe a place or a character. The whole book is just dialogue and action, with minimum vocabulary. When I was 12, I read Rosny Aine's \\"La Guerre du feu\\"(\\"The Quest for Fire\\"), a book full of long but enthralling descriptions of prehistoric swamps, mountains and forests: that is a real adventure book, believe me!<br />Then and more importantly, there is the dubious PC ideology underlying the story. John Granger, in his \\"Hidden Key to Harry Potter\\" (I haven't read the book but I listened to the author on the Jeff rense radio program)cites the following passage as evidence that Rowling teaches children to take moral decisions: Dumbledore tells Harry: \\"Now you have to choose between what is good and what is just easy\\". For me, this is the best proof that there is an ethical flaw in the book, for any attentive person will recognize that the choice should be one between good and evil!<br />And what about the pervasive elitism of the magician horde? Their inexplicable use of money and gold? In the \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\", I was bothered by the buying sprees (and drinking-bouts!)of Harry Potter's friends in Hogsmeade: is the author reminding her readers-in a not too subtle manner-to be good consumers? But what really angers me is the curriculum of the school: the children are taught practical skills but they are not taught any philosophy or religion to help them use these skills wisely. In effect Rowling seems to be telling her readership that you can have science without morality.<br />Buy your child one of Tove Jansson's books for a change.

Each word in the original text has a figure above it. With this number you can find the meaning of the word in the BDB, the best Hebrew Lexicon available on the market.<br />Catholic and Orthodox readers should note that the Interlinear Bible is a Protestant Bible, which means that Baruch, Judith, Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, and 1 and 2 Maccabees are missing.<br />When I have difficuty in understanding a sentence in my Hebrew manual (EKS or Mansoor) or in my Biblia Stuttgartensia, I usually consult this book rather than the Index to the BDB by Bruce Einspahr,a book which I have found quite useless so far.<br />The problem with this Interlinear Bible is the awful quality of the print. Although most of the reviewers mention this flaw, their description is really an understatement: the Hebrew letters are quite distorted, specially at the beginning or end of each sentence, and the vowel signs and the dagesh are hardly decipherable. Of course not all the text is a shambles but certainly more than 60%(I'm talking about the Hebrew text, the Greek text is much more readable)!<br />When I first saw the Hebrew text, I was so disappointed that I thought this book would never be of any use to me. Time though has proven that it was not a total waste of money and as I said above, I now use it frequently although only to check the meaning of a word or passage. I never read the Interlinear Bible first. For reading, I use the Biblia Stuttgartensia (large font), which I recommend strongly.<br />Another problem with this book is that the translation is not always as literal as would be desirable for someone who is looking for the grammatical identity or function of a given word. I can't recall any example right now but I have sometimes found the translation to be misleading in that respect.<br />Finally, I strongly recommend to Hebrew students the Old Testament Parsing Guide by Todd S.Beall. This is an invaluable-but for some mysterious reason rather little known-resource if you want to be able to decipher all the verbs(including participles) in the OT.<br />Considering the high price of this Bible and its awful print quality, I really think you should pause before deciding to buy it.right now but I have sometimes found the translation to be misleading in that respect.<br />Finally, I strongly recommend to Hebrew students the Old Testament Parsing Guide by Todd S.Beall.

The book contains the Greek text of the first six books of the Odyssey plus English translation. The Greek text is NOT scanned.<br />We students of the wonderful language of Homer should consider ourselves really fortunate to have at our side a courageous and competent Greek scholar like Prof.Daitz.<br />Let me tell you that his rendition of the Odyssey with the recontructed pronunciation of 5th century BC Attic Greek is hauntingly beautiful besides being very accurate (every word has been carefully checked by Sydney Allen, the top specialist on ancient Greek phonetics).<br />Some reviewers, judging other recordings of his, have found Daitz's interpretation histrionic. This reproach is not totally groundless but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Greek language and culture. If Daitz seems to be in a state of exaltation when he reads ancient Greek, this is because he is so deeply immersed in and in resonance with the Greek language.<br />I believe that ancient Greek, no matter what classical scholars want you to believe about the so-called rational character of Greek civilization, was a highly colorful and emotional language, otherwise it would not have had pitch accents! Modern languages, including Greek, have lost their original pitch accents because people have become cerebral and dry inside.<br />Moreover, Prof.Daitz's rendition is not exaggerated. This would simply be exhausting for a recording that lasts for half an hour for each side of the six cassettes. He strikes the right tone in each passage and knows how to vary the speed and mood in order not to tire the listener. I was also amazed at his ability to give a voice to the different characters. True, he is better at imitating Zeus or Odysseus than Athena or Telemachus, who sound too shrill and plaintive, but on the whole his imitations are excellent and show his incredible mastery of Greek.<br />Finally, the quality of the recording is excellent and Prof.Daitz's voice comes across with absolute clarity. If you want to enjoy the Odyssey in all its aspects, I think this set of cassettes is not only helpful but esthetically gratifying.s excellent and Prof.Daitz's voice comes across with absolute clarity.

What is \\"Gordano Bruno and the Hermetic tradition\\"?<br />Let me put it very simply: it is a succession of clumsily written reviews of the main Hermetic treatises, starting with the original manuscripts brought over from Byzantium after its fall and ending with the works of Bruno, Campanella and other more recent thinkers and magicians. Each chapter deals with a book or a series of books by one or several Hermeticists. Yates dutifully summarizes the book, adds a few more or less enlightened comments and biographical notes and then moves on to examine the writings of the following Renaissance crank. She makes a copious use of quotations, most of them in Latin and most of them not translated...<br />I want to make something very clear: this is by no way a biography of Bruno. It is not even an intellectual biography of the \\"Nolan philosopher\\": nowhere are we told by Yates why, when and how he became a Hermeticist.In fact, she starts her exposition on him when he is already a full-fledged magus in Paris, where he is trying to engratiate himself with King Henri III by publishing a treatise on mnemonics. The whole first chapter dealing with Bruno is an outline of that book. The following chapter describes another book and so on. Briefly, we never leave the libraries...<br />If you are looking for a insights into how Hermeticism  influenced Renaissance painting, music, architecture and other aspects of civilization, you won't find them here. I repeat, this is a description of the Hermetic literature of the XVIth century in Italy and elsewhere, with a focus on the books written by Bruno.<br />You may now ask: OK, I understand that this is not a biography about Bruno. Does Yates do a good job in explaining the Hermetic treatises?<br />Would you believe a \\"History of Western Scientific Thought\\" written by a Tunguse shaman from Krasnoiarsk ? My guess is that you would at the very least take his exposition with quite a handful of salt.The reason is obvious: a Siberian sorcerer belongs to a world that is too different from ours to be able to really understand Newtonian science. And even if he could understand it, his own religious and cultural background is so hostile to mechanistic science that he is bound to be biased in his treatment of the subject.<br />Now why should one trust an account of Hermetic philosophy and its influence on XVIth century Catholic thinkers written by a modern historian coming from a Protestant and rationalistic tradition?<br />I for one do not believe that such a historian is capable of dealing properly with such a subject and Mrs Yates being precisely the modern, rationalistic, Protestant historian I am talking about(otherwise she would not be an award-winning sacred cow, see what happens to truly great but marginal historians like Hillaire Belloc who are writing from a Catholic perspective) fails in giving a truly enlightening, living picture of Hermeticism and Giordano Bruno.<br />To put it very simply, she does not understand what she is talking about! That is the reason why we get all those insipid summaries worthy of a first year college student.<br />Furthermore, although she shows on the whole more respect toward her characters than your average historian, Yates does regard the Hermetic thinkers of the Renaissance, including Bruno, as a bunch of crackpots and megalomaniacs. Deeply interesting they are but still they are crackpots as all pre-Reformation, pre-Enlightenment thinkers are bound to be in the mind of a mainstream Western historian.<br />Just see how she starts her book in a typical fashion: by condescendingly exposing the superstitious attitude of the ancients. Ficino, Pico, Bruno, they all believed that the Hermetic literature had been written at the time of the pyramids, before Moses! But, aha, WE know that they are in fact nothing more than pious forgeries dating from the 2nd century AD! Casaubon, an obscure Protestant Greek scholar of Swiss origin living in England has proved it. Never mindthis bigot had a huge axe to grind, never mind Pico and Ficino, who believed in the remote antiquity of the Hermetic manuscripts, mastered the Greek language just as well as Casaubon, we should believe the Calvinist philologist because...because he comforts our prejudices, of course!<br />To say that there is absolutely nothing to be learnt from \\"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition\\" would of course be a gross exaggeration, for there are interesting pieces of information scattered throughout the book, specially when the author manages to raise her nose from her nine-point summaries and laborious sketches to give us a larger view of the fascinating world  of the Renaissance but this is really such a minor aspect of \\"Giordano Bruno?that I wouldn't recommend it for that reason.<br />Much better to read Adrian Gilbert's The New Jerusalem\\", believe me.mind this bigot had a huge axe to grind, never mind Pico and Ficino, who believed in the remote antiquity of the Hermetic manuscripts, mastered the Greek language just as well as Casaubon, we should believe the Calvinist philologist because...because he comforts our prejudices, of course!      <br />To say that there is absolutely nothing to be learnt from \\"Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition\\" would of course be a gross exaggeration, for there are interesting pieces of information scattered throughout the book, specially when the author manages to raise her nose from her nine-point summaries and laborious sketches to give us a larger view of the fascinating world  of the Renaissance but this is really such a minor aspect of \\"Giordano Bruno?that I wouldn't recommend it for that reason. <br />Much better to read Adrian Gilbert's The New Jerusalem\\", believe me.	2004-01-18

I had heard the author talk about \\"Human Devolution\\" on two radio programs before ordering it on amazon.com and therefore knew more or less what to expect: it would be an attempt to provide a non materialistic alternative to Darwin's battered theory of evolution, based on the Hindu scriptures(the Vedas).<br />My scepticism stemmed from the consideration that since non materialistic explanations of human origins have been around for millenia, new revelations would be highly improbable even coming from a researcher of Michael Cremo's caliber.<br />To put it briefly, the material on which this book is based is as fantastic (but familiar) as the material of \\"Forbidden Archaelogy\\" was ordinary but nonetheless novel.<br />Throwing all those dull Late Pleistocene flint implements from his previous works to the wind but remaining his old self in his meticulosity, love of detail, erudition (and lack of humor), Michael Cremo boldly presents the reader with what unfortunately amounts to little more than a lengthy encyclopedia of the paranormal.<br />In its more than 500 pages you will meet a motley crowd of stigmatics, extraterrestrials and angels, faith healers, mediums, children with previous lives memories, the Virgin of Fatima and a host of other freaks and exiles banished from the serious scientific literature. Then you have the umpteenth retelling of the Maori and Inuit myths, all the stuff that is the stock-in-trade of so many other(and better)books.<br />Michael Cremo does not even try to give an new interpretation to unexplained phenomena like the apparitions at Fatima. No, he just retells the whole story in lengthy detail, begging the reader to take it as evidence that human beings are more than just a handful of cosmic dust.<br /><br />The teachings of the Vedas, which I thought would be the highlight of the book, are discussed perfunctorily in the last chapter. In an unusual display of brevity, Michael Cremo rounds off his subject in eight pages. Here we learn about demigods and goddesses mating happily to repopulate the earth with humans and other living beings after each cyclic devastation. Basically, that is all the Vedas have to teach us about one of the greatest mysteries of the universe...<br />Is there really nothing new to be gleaned from this book? In rummaging through the cupboards of the scientific community, Michael Cremo does seem to bring to light some interesting skeletons. He shows for example that famous scientists like Wallace (co-author of the theory of evolution) and Pierre and Marie Curie studied paranormal phenomena, to the point of coming to believe in the existence of spirits.<br />But is the heterodoxy of some scientists really something shockingly new? And should the mere fact that a scientist believes in ghosts be regarded as a proof of their existence? After all, scientists are just as gullible and biased as everybody else! It is by now a well-known fact that Newton, besides being a mainstream mathematician, was also deeply interested in hermeticism. People who have read books about ritual abuse, mind control, secret societies and global conspiracies also know that materialism and rationalism are just a convenient facade for the real beliefs of the elite, which is completely under the spell of spiritism and other abominations.<br />Briefly, if you are already familiar with the field of parapsychology, you will find almost nothing in the pages of \\"Human Devolution\\" that is not already known to you.<br />Finally, I found Michael Cremo's treatment of the human trilogy of body, mind and spirit deeply disappointing.

In these long conversations, the question of the ultimate nature of experience is explored in depth. People who have read Krishnamurti's works will struck by the numerous and sometimes baffling similarities.<br />The rest of the book deals with Matthew's spiritual experiences and encounters with spirits and above all with his tumultuous love affairs, which he increasingly comes to regard as a struggle between the powers of light and the powers of darkness as he laboriously but vainly attempts to \\"convert\\" his partners to the life of the Spirit. His candid but unoriginal conclusion is that sex is a waste of time and energy...<br />Lucid dreaming, though frequently mentioned, is NOT discussed in depth in the book. The Face of Power is primarily a philosophical discourse in the form of an autobiographical narrative, peppered with digressions on mysticism, archeology and of course sex. It is not an umpteenth guide to the astral realms or a how-to book about lucid dreaming. What little advice the reader will find scattered in the pages of the \\"Face of Power\\" is of an indirect nature and rather vague. Obviously, the author does not want you to know too much.<br />I sometimes suspected the book to be, in a subtle but nevertheless unmistakable way, an attempt to proselytize its readership, specially people who are ill, since Matthew is quite frank about his healing powers and frequently talks about them. But the tone of deep sincerity of the whole work has convinced me that petty commercialism is far from his mind.<br />This a very well-written book, both entertaining and profound. It is sometimes so dense that you may need to read and reread some passages, specially in the dialogues with Court.

After that unforgettable interview, I decided to order in a local bookstore his \\"Conversations with the Dream Mentor\\", thinking that the book would be contain more and deeper revelations about astral journeys and contacts with masters from other dimensions.<br />To put it in a nutshell, this book has been a total disappointment.This is due to two main factors:<br />The first is that the incidents reported by the author in what amounts to little more than a slightly edited dream journal are regrettably but nonetheless positively uninteresting. Most of the book deals with Von Braschler's wanderings in more or less exotic settings, during which his mentor will usually keep silent while he will utter an ocasional \\"how nice!\\" The master will sometimes prepare a test, which Von Braschler usually fails miserably. Towards the end, he begins to get better while his guide becomes more talkative, but by then the reader will have lost all interest in his dull adventures.<br />The second reason is the poor quality of the author's writing, which is incredibly dry and repetitious. I have lost count of the number of times in which he uses the phrase: \\"I put myself in a state o heightened consciousness\\". Most sentences do not exceed a dozen words, all arranged in exactly the same subject+verb+object pattern and exhibiting a very limited vocabulary. My assumption is that most of the book is in fact a transcription of Von Braschler's own dream journal, which would explain the insipid prose.<br />The book ends with two short chapters stuffed with tips on how to meet a dream master and put oneself \\"in a heightened state of consciousness\\". If you have read Laberge's work or any other how-to manual about lucid dreaming, you will find little that is new here and considering the feeble interest of the author's own experience I expect most readers to just give up any attempt to follow in his blundering footsteps.<br />The only thing that I find commendable about this story is the author's honesty and tone of deep humility, to which I would add its unrelenting realism. If you try to lucid dream yourself, you will probably find that the unimpressive incidents scattered in \\"Conversations with the Drean Mentor\\" are exactly the stuff of which your own dreams are made. In this respect, this book is the exact opposite of the sensational accounts of people like Robert Moss &Co, whose wild adventures are as exciting as they are unlikely to happen to you.readers to just give up any attempt to follow in his blundering footsteps.<br />The only thing that I find commendable about this story is the author's honesty and tone of deep humility, to which I would add its unrelenting realism.

The reason for that is very simple: this is not even remotely a guide to Elizabethan pronunciation but a compilation of all the difficult words in Shakespeare's plays as they are and should be pronounced by American actors, the pronunciation of which is indicated both in the International Phonetic Alphabet and the authors' own phonetic system.<br />The subtitle of this book should really be: A Complete Guide to Pronouncing Shakespeare the American Way.

Nothing...except that it seems rather strange to me to make so much fuss about how to pronounce Shakespeare's words in accordance with the rules of the iambic pentameter, while at the same time completely disregarding the much more basic question of HOW HE pronounced these words himself.<br />Some reviewers (is there a claque on amazon.com?) claim that ALL difficult words are covered in this book. Well, I looked up the quite commonly used \\"o'er\\" and guess what? I did not find it...!<br />The chapter on Latin pronunciation is quite funny: the authors propose to pronounce Cicero's words 1)as modern scholars think they were uttered in Classical Rome 2)as American audiences are accustomed to hear them 3)as the Roman Catholic clergy used to pronounce them! Granted, this is a very minor point but it shows you the methodology followed by the authors.<br />For me, the most useful passage in this manual is the one in the introduction in which the authors discuss previous similar books.

By reading it, you will know what awaits you up there(including bowel problems and insect plagues) and get a feeling for the country and its inhabitants. The White rock tells the story of about twenty years of treks by Hugh Thomson and his British pals in the Andes region, mostly along ancient Inca paths. About all the interesting sites, both natural and man-made, are covered: Machu-Pichu, Cuzco, Lake Titicaca, etc.<br />If you are interested in the Incas but only moderately so, in other words if you want to know more about this ancient people but do not have enough time or enthusiasm to read a detailed scholarly study about it, you may consider buying this book. In its pages, you will get small doses of Inca history interspersed among more contemporary material.You will also learn about the ancient and contemporary explorers of the land, starting with Pizarro and ending with present-day archeologists,travelers and photographers like Von Hagen, Chambi, etc.<br />If you are looking for a finely written travel account with strong literary flavor, this book is NOT for you. Contrary to what is stated in the reviews on the back of the book, the author is a not a great writer at all. He is quite incapable to describe either the landscape or the inhabitants with real talent.Also owing to his poor writing skills, he completely fails to conjure up the magical atmosphere of the great ancient sites and recreate for you the lost world of the Incas. The travel narrative itself, besides being quite uneventful, is quite plain and completely lacking in romanticism. At many points, it is even anticlimactic, like when, in his first expedition, Hugh Thomson rediscovers the lost Inca fortress of LLactapata.<br />They suddenly see it at the end of an exhausting hike, they camp there, clean up the place a little bit and then off they go...! I had expected Thomson to give more details about what was after all the stated goal of his first expedition to Peru but the fact is that the rediscovery of Llactapata takes less than one page. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is little more than a succession of similar superficial sketches.<br />The digressions about the Incas are not without interest but quite unoriginal. Considering the author's complete lack of training in history, archeology or anthropology, some of his peremptory judgements about this ancient civilization sound pretty silly: was Machu Pichu nothing more than a holiday resort for a hedonistic emperor and his court? Did the Incas choose the location of their buildings in order to enjoy the great views that they could afford? I doubt it...<br />To put it briefly, this book is really nothing more than a long and rather mediocre National Geographic article.

I started with EKS and bought HSBS when I was half through EKS. I study Hebrew on my own.<br />The reason why I bought HSBS is because I got terribly bored with EKS and its endless exercices stuffed with silly sentences. Moreover, I wanted a more handy manuel which I could carry around. I was also hoping to find a manual which would be more friendly and comforting in tone than the icy impersonal EKS.<br />Well, HSBS by Menachem Mansoor was exactly what I was looking for! The exercices are short, the book is handy, the tone is friendly and there are plently of charmingly outdated photographs of the Holy Land and its inhabitants to enliven the the explanations and drills.<br />This is not to say that HSBS is perfect. It lacks verb charts and it does a very poor job in explaining the verb patterns, which are presented en bloc in one lesson at the end of the book. If I had not read other grammars before, I am sure I would have become panicky at the sight of so much new stuff.<br />Some reviewers find HSBS lacking in explanations. I think this judgement is not fair. EKS also omits to give many important explanations, specially concerning vowel changes. As a matter of fact EKS often seems reluctant to explain anything at all as if it wanted to make it easier for you to learn Hebrew. It just shows you the charts and that's it. As a result, in the multitudinous exercises you will often find forms which really puzzle you and you will search in vain for an explanation. So, on the whole I found HSBS more thorough, EXCEPT when it comes to clarifying the different verb forms.<br />Above all, this is a very user-friendly manual, one in which the author really talks with you at every stage, telling you what is important, what you ought to study and how. In this respect, it is ideally suited for self-study.<br />My advice is: buy EKS and HSBS. But my favorite one is HSBS.e one is HSBS.	2004-01-01

It comprises a booklet with theoretical explanations and the Greek examples read by Prof. Daitz, and two one hour cassettes.<br />Far from being boring or pedantic, Prof. Daitz comes across in this recording as a very passionate, knowledgeable and humane person, the kind of teacher I would have liked to have when in secondary school. He knows how to make his explanations more comprehensible for the listener by using interesting and even humorous anecdotes and one simply regrets that the tapes are so short.<br />The only shortcoming of this crash course in Attic pronunciation is the lack of simple and contrasting examples to learn the pitch accents. The list of 20 words read by Prof. Daitz is definitely not enough and one wishes that he would have illustrated the pronunciation of ancient Greek in a sentence with very simple examples like &quot;the man rides a mule to the market&quot; . Instead he recites a passage from the Apology of Socrates by Plato, which is fine except that the sheer complexity of the sentence structure makes it very difficult for the befuddled beginner to pay attention to the pronunciation.<br />Can one learn the pitch accents? I think it is possible with time and intelligent effort and the best way to do it is to follow Prof Daitz' own recommendations by listening to pitch variations in one's own native language. As a matter of fact, I have noticed that I use pitch accents instead of stress when talking with my pets and young children and I do it effortlessly. Pitch accents obviously represent a more emotional and childlike stage in the development of language, one which is very close to singing.<br /><br />For me, learning to sing the pitch accents has made the study of ancient Greek a thousand times more attractive, for who would deny that most of the charm of any language resides in its sound? One can only thank Prof. Daitz for all his labors in bringing to light this otherwise neglected aspect of Greek genius.n only thank Prof. Daitz for all his labors in bringing to light this otherwise neglected aspect of Greek genius.	2003-12-30

It is divided into two parts: the first gives the reader a global view of history divided into different eras(e.g.the advent of agriculture, trade and first cities, the age of the crusades,etc.), the second describes regional history (North America, South America, Africa, Europe,West Asia, South and South East Asia, Noth and East Asia, Oceania, the Arctic and Antarctica).In both parts you will find numerous time lines with the important dates, small color illustrations and short paragraphs about the events covered.At the end of the book there is a subject index and glossary and an index with all the place names shown on the maps.Finally there is a two page bibliography.<br />There is no question that this is a very beautiful book with pleasant pastel colors, pleasant, glossy paper and maps of different sizes and seen under different angles, which avoids monotony.<br />Having said that, it is also clear for an attentive reader that the editor has been at pains to be absolutely politically correct, which means:<br />-ostentatious use of BCE and CE instead of AD and BC<br />-gross neglect of Christianity: whereas the spread of Islam is worth a double page with big maps in both sections of the Atlas, there is not a single chapter or map about the spread or history of Christianity, which is amazing, considering its importance for the \\"human journey\\". In the index, Jesus is nonchalantly called \\"the inspiration of the Christian religion\\" (is it an abstract character, one wonders), crucified as a \\"troublemaker in 29 CE\\". Strangely enough, Buddha and Muhammad are called \\"founders\\" of their respective religions, which is quite true but why deny the title to Christ?<br />The entry for \\"Christianity\\" is also enlightening: here we are told that the early Christian faith, which is decribed as an \\"offshoot of Judaism\\", split from the very beginning into \\"many sects\\". Never mind the same happened to Islam, there is no mention of any heresies or infighting inside that religion at the corresponding entry.<br />I also could not find a single time line showing the birth or death of Jesus and other great Christians like Paul and Peter.<br />-neglect of European history: although European history is the best documented, in this atlas it is treated on the same level as Africa or Australia, which means that at least a dozen chapters and scores of maps are missing for the serious student of history.<br /><br />Being anti-Christian and anti-European are, as some have rightly said, the last acceptable prejudices.m, there is no mention of any heresies or infighting inside that religion at the corresponding entry.<BR>I also could not find a single time line showing the birth or death of Jesus and other great Christians like Paul and Peter.<BR>-neglect of European history: although European history is the best documented, in this atlas it is treated on the same level as Africa or Australia, which means that at least a dozen chapters and scores of maps are missing for the serious student of history.<BR><br />Being anti-Christian and anti-European are, as some have rightly said, the last acceptable prejudices.	2003-12-28

I call substandard historiography a way of writing history with a narrow focus on isolated events. Typically this is how school history textbooks are written (or used to be written).<br />\\"The Louisiana Purchase\\" by Thomas Fleming offers no explanation whatsoever about the broader social, political and economic context in which this momentous event took place. There are no maps and worse still, the reader will look in vain for a description of Louisiana: what territories it encompassed, who lived there, who explored it are subjects the author entirely leaves out. \\"The Louisiana Purchase\\" is just a chronicle of the diplomatic tug of war surrounding the deal in Paris and Washington and nothing more.<br />To this narrow focus I add a grotesque misrepresentation of the French side. The depiction of Napoleon is little more than a caricature: he is again and again portrayed as the Corsican ogre so dear to English propaganda, and the other French characters in the book get the same treatment.<br />Finally, what is also totally lacking in this book is reflection. Never does the author stop his narrative to share his thoughts with the reader although many of the events that he relates invite questions or comments. Like in a Hollywood film, events succeed each other without any respite.<br />This is simply not the kind of history one should read at the beginning of the 21st century.	2003-12-18

Not that the author lacks style (he has plenty of it), but he writes about everything in a disconnected and superficial way. Now he is talking about the Pope as a freemason, now about fabulous artificial beings made by medieval rabbis(the golems), then he switches to the Unabomber, rails against the electronic media and the passivity of the average American citizen, drops a few words about Jesus and the Gospel and so forth.<br />I thought the author's strong point was the secret meaning of serial murders but he does a very poor job in elucidating this question. He points to hidden meanings behind events by referring to Hermetic or Kabbalistic concepts and symbols but he does not explain what those concepts and symbols mean. Hoffman apparently assumes everybody is well versed in Kabbalistic and Hermetical doctrine.<br />Finally, as if he didn't know how to fill the gaps, he ends the book with two interviews of him by alternative magazines,which only confirms one's suspicion that this is more a hastily put together patchwork of ideas than a well-thought out piece of historical research.<br /><br />I am thankful for the two or three good ideas I found in this book (the role of exposure in the global conspiracy and the real nature of the civilizations that built Stonehenge and the pyramids)but at the same time I feel quite confused and puzzled about the topics covered. This is a book that either makes you feel like reading more about conspiracies and secret societies or give up the idea of ever buying a conspiracy book again.	2003-12-02

In the second part, he examines the finds which support the theory of evolution concerning the origin of mankind and shows their controversial nature and even their flaws.<br />I found this book quite engrossing although the accounts are all pretty much the same:\\"In 1872 X found some stone implements in a quarry 56 feet under the ground, etc., etc.\\" And the discoveries he describes are very modest: you don't hear about prehistoric jets or computers, golden tablets with mysterious hieroglyphs and stellar maps of the Pleiades. No, in the pages of \\"Hidden History\\" you will only stumble upon mortars and pestles, bolas, scrapers, arrow points, nails, coins, golden chains and a rare inscription. Nothing to fantasize about, but enough to cast serious doubts about accepted theories on human evolution.<br />The author adopts a very sober, measured style of writing and never indulges in sensationalist remarks a la Art Bell or in fiery attacks against the establishment. But the discoveries he is talking about are so new and unexpected that he somehow manages to catch your attention and I have read this book faithfully every day, which is quite rare in my reading pratice. I am almost tempted to say that this book held me under a kind of hypnotic spell.<br />I highly recommend \\"The Hidden History of the Human Race\\": it will definitely change your ideas about the origins of humanity and the credibility of maintream science. Even if you are a staunch evolutionist you might be impressed by this book because it is written in such a calm and objective way.	2003-11-16

There are also lots of famous quotes from the New Testament and from Greek authors at the back of the book.<br />I have been using this book as an auxiliary manual, my main manual being William D.Mounce's grammar of NT Greek. The reason why I didn't start learning Greek with this book is because it is clearly not meant for people who want to study Greek on their own. The book opens with a series of easy dialogues to be used in the class-room. No translation is provided since the teacher is supposed to be there. This quite abrupt introduction put me off completely and I started looking elsewhere. Another downside is the overall presentation, which is quite messy. Some pages clearly suffer from an overload of information and look like a real jungle.<br />Having digested he main points of Greek grammar thanks to Mounce's remarkably clear and scientific exposition, I have come back to this book for its charming little stories.<br />Another interesting feature of this manual is the addition of notes and remarks about linguistics, history and culture, as well as judicious study hints.<br />Nevertheless, if you are planning to learn Greek on your own, I advise you to learn Koine Greek first and buy Mounce's remarkable books.

On the one hand I found this (very cheap and handy)book very useful in that it contains detailed, clear descriptions of lots of different techniques for inducing lucid dreams. I often read it in the dead of the night after my first awakening in order to focus my mind on lucid dreaming before going to sleep again and I have found it very effective in inducing a heightened state of consciousness in dreams.<br />On the other hand, this is a very irritating book because of Laberge's dogmatic insistence that dreams are just mental constructions, illusions created by the brain, which in philosophical jargon I term a typical case of scientific reductionism: the \\"nothing more than\\" disease which afflicts the whole scientific establishment in the West.<br />Although the author does not realize it, such a trivial theory undermines his whole case for trying to have lucid dreams and getting answers to deep questions from dreams in the first place: why should one bother about illusions? Besides, if the content of dreams comes solely from one's individual brain, how can one expect to find anything new in one's dreams? Obviously this is an illustration of the famous principle GI-GO (garbage in/garbage out).<br />Of course, being a Western scientist trained at Stanford University, Laberge could not possibly have come up with more exotic but perhaps more accurate explanations, namely the existence of etheric bodies and realms, which have a transpersonal nature.<br />Buy the book for the methods and tricks but look for inspiration elsewhere. Where? This is a hard question. No matter how much inspiration self-proclaimed dream guides purport to draw from their fantastic adventures in dreamland (I'm thinking of Robert Moss), I haven't as yet read a single really well-written book on dreams and lucid dreaming, although the topic is such an interesting one. All are trivial, boastful and superficial, if not downright misleading.<br />Maybe the best solution is to trust yourself and go through the whole process of trial and error with the aid of the few tricks that really work for you, tricks which you can find easily on the Internet.

The accompanying text contains very little that is original, being mostly a patchwork of quotes from famous people, personal anecdotes and transcripts of talks given by the author. So if you are looking for profound, elaborate spiritual teachings you will be disappointed.

It covers both elementary and intermediate Hebrew and in this respect is more advanced that its rival on the market, Hebrew Step by Step by Mansoor.<br />Each lesson begins with a series of (non Biblical)sentences that include the points of grammar of the preceding lesson followed by a short list of new words. Then comes the grammatical theory. The lesson proceeds with an impressive (and sometimes overwhelming)array of exercises, all with non Biblical sentences, followed by an extract of the Book of Ruth and a folk tale from the Western tradition(in Hebrew of course).<br />The book is large with a big Hebrew font, which makes it the most visually appealing although it lacks illustrations.(The format makes for easy reading but not for easy transportation outside your deskroom. One of the reasons why I ended up buying Mansoor's manual was because I wanted to study Hebrew anywhere and its small format was what I needed.)<br />The material contained in one lesson is really elephantine, specially toward the end of the book, but the strategy of HP is just that: help you to memorize through constant repetition.<br />The main advantage of the Hebrew Primer(HP)is its very thorough and clear coverage of the verb forms, a domain in which it undoubtedly beats HSBS, which is shoddy and superficial in  its treatment of this vital aspect of Hebrew grammar. Not only does HP explain the verbs and their modifications very well, it also gives you plenty of examples of the verb form under consideration in the exercises that follow the grammatical theory. In addition, there are huge charts with all the verb forms(imperfect, perfect, participle, imperative, infinitive and participles)at the end of the book. What more could a serious Hebrew student desire? And the same applies to the nouns: there are charts for the plural and construct forms. Finally HP explains how to use the BDB English and Hebrew Lexicon, the best Hebrew dictionary available on the market.<br />What I found most disappointing about this book is its dry, strictly technical approach to the language and its impersonal tone. Don't expect any historical or cultural digressions, witty remarks, encouragements or study hints.
