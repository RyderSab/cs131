She has had (and I believe still has) a mesmerizing life. She made some errors, recognized them, and always been willing to grow and modify with the times and because of her own experiences.<br /><br />I discovered something that I did not know when I bought the book-to love and admire this woman more.<br /><br />I read it in one night, and I could not put it down! The most important thing about this book is that you will read a portion and then put it down and start looking at yourself.<br /><br />If you have any interest in overcoming problems, (as I did, and anyone should) this is important read. It is about beautiful Jane, and so much more...<br />stars	2005-05-03

Especially when he is provoking doubts that are fostered spontaneously and naturally to us, who are most ignorant and uneducated folks when Atheism is mentioned.<br /><br />People's longing a world where factual and false can be plainly distinguished, and that religions, ideologies, methods and practices are established on this longing. These people want to judge before they comprehend. This is one harmful free thought that we all have to erase from our already socially manipulated and screwed up brains.<br /><br />I recognized language of wisdom, intelligent and unforgettable analogies, and many excellent thoughts in this book. Certainly, anyone interested in contemplation, conviction, faith, religion, science or cultural relativism definitely should have this book.	2005-04-15

I didn't mind his overwhelming lecturing if the characters were not predictable. The characters seemed like robots, not something you will expect out of human beings. Everyone in this book is one dimensional, forgettable, and unconvincing. I wonder if some wealthy Republican paid to have this book published and be glowingly promoted?	2004-12-19

It can be a great gift for any child to start the holiday tradition of packing and unpacking lots of products as early as June, and turn that child into a great spender and consumer as soon as possible. However while reading this book a child can dream about the Christmas decorations, reading non-stop about imaginary Santa arriving on Christmas Eve while lots of his peers have not even a slice of bread on their tables, starving from hunger. It is an exciting book to brainwash your child and turn it into a little selfish monster.	2004-11-26

It covers the step-by-step death of Yugoslavia, and like many reviewers I found biases dragging all over the book as if the Muslims are saints and the Serbs devils. The blame on Milosevic is constant, but the blame of Tudjman does not exist. How good or bad Milosevic is/was, it was designed and decided by the USA and the Western Europe-same like in Irag, with once Western darling Saddam Hussein and suddenly the evil, the demon. The ethnic differences in Jugoslavia were created and provoked by the USA and the Western Europe ONLY by corrupting the Balkans governments in search for more markets for their collapsing empires and places for their oil tubes for their SUV's and polluted fat ways of living.<br /><br />NOTE: War came and none of the Balkan sides were angles; In Wars, all sides are guilty and do things, evil. And as Christian nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism rose due to the Western Help, the Balkans were turned into s***ty colonial provinces that since Yugoslavia is gone, have one of the lowest standards of living and depressing future. And that is a fact. The Land of Yugoslavia, once so strong, now is FOR SALE to the Western Powers, while Balkan people are getting poorer and poorer.

I was astonished at how the author managed to capture the torment of young love so perfectly. It is one of the best coming-of-age stories I've read in years. The lead character, Sam, a gay teenage punk rock skater boy, and the dude he's in love with, Clay, a slightly older surfer, are so authentic. I felt like I was literally inside Sam's head. Plus, the Hawaii setting feels totally genuine. I am looking forward to reading more books by this talented new writer.	2004-09-07

It's in fact describing the whole rule of Ottoman Empire over small Bosnian bridge and cities it connects. The actual perish of Ottoman reign over Bosnia is symbolized in the very last sentence of the novel. This is a great book that uncovers life in Bosnia in very vivid, terrified and truthful way, and not only those who understand the history of Bosnia throughout centuries, yet many others can appreciate this great literary work. Ivo Andric with his addictive writing adds more beauty to it.	2004-09-07

The book is hypnotizing in style. The characters are haunted with their dreadful pasts. They are slowly uncovering the wounds of their pasts while getting used to the quieter ambiance following the Second World War.

I know lots of women who pledge that they and their partners are monogamous, so there's no need for protection from diseases. I know plenty of women who desire a man so badly that they would never suspect anything and would take what on earth they can get. This is very important book for all females. The novel starts with a tough masculine security officer, a husband and father, unfaithful to his wife by having sex with a transvestite. He tries to deny his appetites but he lost the battle becomes sexually engaged with the transvestite, other men, women, and adolescent boys and girls. It is the most significant novel I've read in a long time because it talked about sexual behavior and it even had a chart on STDs.	2004-05-14

Ivan Denisovich is a symbol of bravery of the human spirit in despair. This story is necessary for all of us who used to the living in a society that supports freedom. The images of the Siberian camps in the Stalinist era are disturbing but impressive. There are many powerful outlines that express what a prisoner has to do in order to survive. Solzhenitsyn captures the society's dehumanization masterly. I was arrested in this story, making me feel as if I am Ivan Denisovich's cellmate. This is a masterwork on the psychology of continued existence. Reading about Ivan's life changed how I live each day. My uncle met Solzhenitsyn in CT. Great man. I wish I met him. He is one of my idols.	2004-05-13
