It's an old-time jest when somebody is blindsided, knocked flat, dazed and confused.  That was my reaction entering a graduate school of education after 40 years in business.  Foucault who?<br /><br />It is a whole raft of PC truck and amazing license with the facts and the methodology of research, an immense gulf between theories of how people are and one's real-life experience.  Ellis provides the service of describing, cataloging, and providing a history and analysis of the race-gender-class theories driving political correctness.  My goal is to extract Cliff notes of the major concepts to share here and for my own reference.<br /><br />The most fundamental dichotomy is between humanity and society.  People and the institutions they have built.  PC sides with Rousseau in believing that people in a state of nature are fundamentally good but that society has corrupted them.  If \\"man is born free, yet everywhere in chains,\\" somebody is to blame.  Political correctness, like Marxism which preceded it, is a blame game.  It theorizes that a conspiracy based on race (white), gender (male), sexual persuasion (straight) and class (the capitalists) to exploit, demean, and abuse everybody else.  Mankind will only be free when the millennium arrives and these \\"hegemonists\\" and the societies they have built are swept away to be replaced by new, shining, ideal institutions.<br /><br />Rousseau's view inspired the French and Russian revolutions.  Hobbes, Locke and the other philosophers who inspired ours took the opposite view.  They hold that man is inherently selfish, and that we need the social contract and governments to hold our worser nature in check.<br /><br />Society is not and never will be perfect.  Nonetheless, looking around one can see that today's European or American enjoys more opportunity, wealth, health and other good things of life than any of his ancestors or any other societies on earth.  It isn't perfection, but it is also not to be lightly discarded, nor certainly to be despised for its putative failings.<br /><br />Ellis blames careerism for the curious fact that literary critics now tend to propound theories in the realms of philosophy, psychology, political science and sociology, and at the same time appear to have become indifferent to the aesthetics of literature itself.  Critics find little new to be said about world's body of great literature, which has been analyzed ad nauseam.  On the other hand there are exciting things happening elsewhere in academia.  An academic career has to be based on fresh ideas, and the only place to find them is outside the field.  Ellis enumerates borrowings from physics, anthropology and elsewhere, the authors of which often disown the half-baked theories literary critics have spun from their research.<br /><br />Careerism alone does not fully explain political correctness.  There is the traditional distain of the academic for the common man, and the traditional ivory-tower intellectual's inclination towards radicalism.  The softer side of academia is also prone to embrace intellectual fads.  Communism, existentialism, Oriental religions, Leary's dope philosophy and Scientology held sway when I was at Cal in the `60s.  Some stuff Ellis talks about, such as critical race studies, feminism and queer theory, are more recent.<br /><br />Ordinary intuition tells you that there are logical flaws in the politically correct bilge coming out of the academy.  Ellis' service is to apply a nomenclature to their pretentious nonsense.<br /><br />The Genetic fallacy is the notion that one's genetic makeup affects external reality, as in, \\"It's a black thing... you wouldn't understand.\\" It drives the notion that only women can be professors of Women's Studies, blacks of Black Studies, etc.  Scholarship does not rely on its own internal consistency and being independently verifiable and reproducible -- Francis Bacon's ideas formalized by John Locke during the Enlightenment -- but on the geneticmakeup of the researcher.<br /><br />The Intentionality fallacy claims that a literary text does not speak for itself.  Instead, it is the author's intent that matters.  Needless to say this is taken as a license to practice retroactive psychoanalysis and discover -- O!, shock! -- that straight white male authors had none but despicable intentions and misogynistic views of women and gloated in their superiority over other races.<br /><br />The Affective fallacy holds that what matters is not the text itself but the reader's affect upon reading the text.  Since this will surely vary from reader to reader, the text itself therefore lacks any intrinsic qualities apart from the very words themselves.  It is meaningless to look for a common interpretation of the text.  Presumably by this reading even allegory, metaphor and imagery are ruled out; certainly some readers will be ignorant of the referents.<br /><br />One of Ellis' recurrent themes is that the race-gender-class theorists are thoroughly inconsistent.  On the one hand they agree with the deconstructionists that any text, any reality, can be only be studied as a collection of minute parts, the relationships among which disappear in the deconstruction.  No relationships, no constructed meaning.  Or conversely, all meaning is constructed, chacun &agrave; son go√ªt, at the whim of the author.  In any case there is no permanent, transcendent meaning to anything.  Or morality or anything else.  But yet, yet the race-gender-class advocates theorizes there are some eternal truths, among them the malevolent intent of certain types of people towards other types.<br /><br />Ellis returns again and again to the Enlightenment.  What is unique about Europeans is not that they practiced slavery - everybody did that and many still do.  but that western societies were the only ones to abandon the practice, and they did it on moral grounds, against their own economic interests.  Societies throughout history have attempted to dominate one another.  Once again, it was Europeans and Americans, following Enlightenment philosophy, who abandoned their attempts to build empire.  In fact, the value of equality that underlies race-gender-class theory is a direct product of the Enlightenment.  The difference is only a matter of degree.  Theory paints issues in black and white.  They tolerate no gradual transitions or residual inequalities.  Theory would sweep away today's society, despite the considerable advances over where it was, and its considerably more equitable treatment of racial, class and gender minorities than other societies, in the attempt to replace it with a radically new and improved society.  The theorists have learned nothing from the French revolution, and are both tragic and comic in their attempts to explain away the failures of Marxism and Communism.<br /><br />Employing a Hegelian term of which the Marxists are fond, Ellis says that the PC crowd preaches historically but judge ahistorically.  They judge American actions at the 1789 Constitutional Convention in the light of modern PC standards.  Yet they give the savagery of genital mutilation, slavery and intertribal genocide in today's third world a pass.<br /><br />Theorists claim that the \\"truths\\" of the literature of dead white males are invalid.  Ellis question is, \\"what truths?\\"  He contends that literature does not attempt to express eternal verities so much as eternal questions.  In doing so it is almost always regarded with suspicion by the powers that be.  Literature such as Madame. Bovary, Candide, Gulliver's Travels, On the Road, Animal Farm, Huckleberry Finn and in fact almost any great work that comes to mind, tends to challenges orthodoxies more than establish them.<br /><br />Tenaciously held theory supports action, not analysis.  Action is antithetical to the purposes of the University: research and debate in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom.  Activism implies dedication to a cause, hence an outcome, andhence rejection of research that doesn't support the activists' theses.  Activists shout down their foes, subjecting them to withering ad hominem attacks rather than logically rebutting their points.  Larry Summers treatment by the women of Harvard is a classic example.<br /><br />Ellis concludes with the sad prognosis that the corruption is now so deeply engrained in the Universities, with whole departments dedicated to race-class-gender issues, that it will be around for a long time.  I propose it is the AIDS of the meme community; it has compromised its hosts' defenses (American universities) to the point that they may never shake it.

Noam Chomsky is a surprising entry.<br /><br />I'm a Slightly Order Guy (white, straight... totally out of fashion) who was flattened by a couple of feminist profs upon returning to campus last year.  Michel who?  I read Foucault, Derrida and Rorty to try to make sense of it all.  It didn't.  A high school friend of mine, a prof who fled to Canada to dodge the draft, and certainly no conservative, informed me that I was encountering a social phenomenon; philosophy had little to do with it, and recommended two excellent books: \\"Literature Lost\\" and this.<br /><br />\\"Literature Lost\\" is an easier read, and benefits from the topical organization that a single author can provide.  \\"Theory's Empire\\" is among other things a celebration of the English language.  The authors are so literate!  It also provides a wonderful diversity of perspectives with regard to literary theory, political correctness, and the trends and motivations that have driven so many college departments so far from their stated objectives of unbiased research, intellectual curiousity and open debate.<br /><br />Here's the first page of one of the delicious articles, \\"The Cant of Identity\\" by Todd Gitlin:<br /><br />\\"THE MORE VOCIFEROUSLY a term is trumpeted in public, the more contestable it is under scrutiny. The automatic recourse to a slogan, as if it were tantamount to a value or an argument, is frequently a measure of the need to suppress a difficulty or a vagueness underneath. Cant is the hardening of the aura around a concept. Cant automates thought, substitutes for deeper assessments, creates the illusion of firmness where there are only intricacies, freezes a fluid reality. Cant is sincere, usually, and its sincerity also protects against scrutiny. Cant comforts. And cant tends to corrupt its opposition into countercant. There is the cant of identity and the cant that rises with righteous and selective indignation against the \\"political correctness\\" of the Left, though not against that of the Right.<br /><br />The cant of identity underlies identity politics, which proposes to deduce a position, a tradition, a deep truth, or a way of life from a fact of birth, physiognomy, national origin, sex, or physical disability. The hardening of one of these categories into cant begins with binary thinking-things are either raw or cooked, male or female, this or that-a propensity that may indeed be, as Levi-Strauss maintained, universal. Anxiety generated by difference may well be embedded in the human condition; so may be the animosity that accompanies anxiety. Perhaps the capacity quickly to classify \\"the other\\" as same or different, friend or enemy, once conferred a benefit for survival. But whether or not it was originally a means of natural selection, this sort of binary thinking certainly helps clans, elites, and nations maintain themselves. From binary thinking follows a propensity for identity thinking, which categorizes strangers-this is a person of Type X, not Type Y. The identity thinking of the powerful reassures them that they deserve to rule; the identity thinking of the oppressed affirms that they are not who the rulers think they are. If the identity affirmation of the oppressed begins as a defense against claims of superiority, it can swerve into its own sense of superiority. All forms of identity politics are overly clear about who the insiders are-\\"normal Americans,\\" \\"the people,\\"\\"la Raza,\\"-and overly dismissive of outsiders. In either case, cant makes for efficient simplifications, but only at the price of rigidity. Cant is what we have when we think we know more than we do. Its opposite is curiosity.\\"<br /><br />The collection is so rich that many more reviewers will be able to cover it from entirely different perspectives with meaningful posts.

If race is a hoax, it has taken in all people of every recorded epoch, from Herodotus down to ourselves.  It is not simply America, nor is it recent.  A focus on our society in our century is far too myopic.<br /><br />Graves has drawn on good sources.  He has drawn somewhat different conclusions than writers whom he cites, such as Cavalli-Sforza.  His book would be better if the bibliography were better ordered.  Along with Cavalli-Sforza he might have mentioned Spencer Wells' \\"The Journey of man.\\"<br /><br />The book is flawed by a number of non sequiturs.

The book could have been better edited; too many errors of grammar, usage and even spelling slipped through.<br /><br />I tend to trust Black commentators on American race issues.  John Ogbu, like Bill Cosby, Larry Elder and Thomas Sowell, has an intellectual stature that demands he be taken seriously and an immunity to charges of racism.  Another author would not have gotten away with the phrase \\"academic disengagement.\\"  Yet at the end of the book one realizes how appropriate that two-word appraisal is.<br /><br />It is refreshing as well to read an author with an anthropologist's orientation.  Ogbu's exhaustive study gave him an opportunity to repeat and reinforce earlier findings in Stockton and Oakland, California, and elsewhere and tailor findings to the Shaker Heights situation.<br /><br />Blacks are, like American Indians, non-voluntary minorities.  To say the least, most of their ancestors did not exactly enlist for service in the United States.  The fewer and more recent voluntary black immigrants such as Colin Powell are interesting in two respects.  First, their children do better in school than native born blacks.  Secondly, however, subsequent generations born in the United States tend to adopt the (dysfunctional) attitudes of the native-born.<br /><br />Ogbu's contention is that Blacks' profound distrust of the establishment and their conviction that they will not get a fair shake predisposes them not to give their full effort to schoolwork.  Their defeatist attitudes start to emerge in the later primary years and are highly apparent by high school.  Among the contributing factors are inappropriate role models -- sports and entertainment figures and various types of outlaws -- and a lack of parental involvement in the children's schooling.  He describes a black expectation of a \\"beer mug\\" approach to teaching  The teacher pours knowledge into the passive student.  In this model the parents' job is to get the child to school, and the blame is on the teachers if he doesn't learn.  He says also that parents are more attuned to whether teachers \\"care\\" than whether they are effective teachers.<br /><br />He surveys a range of attempts to find solutions in changes to the school model: vouchers, charters, merit pay and so on.  None have been, by his assessment, markedly successful.  His recommendation is to change the culture of the learners themselves.  Reinforce positive study habits, recognize achievement, and arm the students against the inevitable attempts of their peers to drag them into mediocrity.<br /><br />I amend this review to refer the reader to \\"Crash Course\\" by Chris Whittle (and my review of the same).  Whittle manages charter schools for underprivileged children in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia and elsewhere, and has quite a bit of success.  He employs some of the ideas Ogbu advocates.<br /><br />Ogbu did a workmanlike job of taking into consideration such factors as parental education, income and peer group values in comparing black and white students.  He did so by drawing on his wealth of experience with Black students throughout America.  Since his distinction between voluntary and involuntary immigrant status is central to his argument, it would have been useful to attempt to sort out  those aspects of the Black educational experience that are unique within the American environment from those that characterize Black students in other national settings.

I was pleased to find that even as a non-philosopher I had a general notion of his whereabouts.  I do wonder, however, if he couldn't have made his case using somewhat more accessible prose.<br /><br />Galston's definition of liberalism is closer to the 18th century than today.  It is the liberalism of toleration, based on \\"....two distinct principals, which I shall summarize under the headings of autonomy and diversity.  By `autonomy' I mean self-direction.....By `diversity' I mean, straightforwardly, legitimate differences among individuals and groups over such matters as the nature of the good life, sources of moral authority, reason vs. faith, and the like.\\"<br /><br />John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism is on the right track, but misguided because he assumes a \\"sumum bonum\\", the greatest good for the greatest number.  Galston points out that the real world is more difficult.  Your values are different than mine.  If I have season tickets to the Redskins and you season tickets to the opera, the best of all worlds is not to swap 50:50.  Our tastes are different.<br /><br />There is room for a great deal of diversity in the public, or civic sphere of our lives.  Different churches, different restaurants, different types of books.  We should each be free to pursue our own interests with minimum interference.  Government should intrude as little as possible.  Let the market decide whether the town will support a Chinese restaurant, a drag strip or a go-go bar, with the caveat that government can be brought in when there are legitimate conflicts of interest... such as the noise and traffic a drag strip might generate.<br /><br />Government, because it has the power of coercion, should confine its spheres of interest to the greatest extent possible.  Galston lines up with the Supreme Court when it struck down an Oregon law prohibiting private schools and an Iowa law outlawing instruction in the German language.  It should stay out of religion except in extreme cases, such as sects that practice human sacrifice, etc.  He is more tolerant of religion generally than most contemporary \\"liberals.\\"  He as much as says that he doesn't buy into Christian beliefs but respects the fact that said beliefs form the cornerstone of lives that are examples of virtue and industry.<br /><br />Education is perhaps the most interesting sphere of investigation because it involves the formation of a new person who belongs in degrees that vary with time to his parents (forgive the gender usage here), the state, and to himself.  The state has an interest to see that parents do not deprive a child of education, but parents have an equal right to see that the state does not indoctrinate their children with beliefs (evolution, the virtue of homosexuality) with which the parents disagree.  Galston firmly supports the right of parents to choose from a plurality of educational options, even within the public sphere.<br /><br />The word \\"libertarian\\" does not appear in the book, likely because it is more of a political than a philosophical concept.  While I doubt Galston would characterize himself as such, his philosophical reasoning appears to me to point in that direction.  Looking for a maximum of \\"liberal pluralism\\" would appear to mean keeping the government out of as many spheres as possible, and encouraging government to act at the most local appropriate level.  He out and says that a law that works in a homogeneous European country is likely not to work in America, with its abundance of minorities and diverse religious sects.  The degree to which wealth is redistributed, medicine and socialized, religion is tolerated in the schools can and should vary among places and peoples.<br /><br />Even democracy is only a value, not an absolute.  It is a means to his proposed end, value pluralism, as a consensus rather than a revealed notion of the best type of arrangement that can be made for people to live in comity.  Galston points out several aspects of our society (the jury system, Federal Reserve) that do not operate by strictly democratic principles.<br /><br />I'll stop here.  This is a lay interpretation of a book that really belongs to the philosophers.  I wish one would review it.  As a footnote, Galston worked in the Clinton White House from 1993 to 1995.  That is to say, for the guy I voted for instead of for the lying hypocrite I came to wish Congress had the guts to throw out.  \\"Liberal Pluralism\\" is consistent with the story Mr. Clinton was telling in 1992. NB: Change of opinion.  After 8 years of GWB and a couple of Obama, Clinton looks awfully good.  At least he is smart.<br /><br />(Added in 2005) I had the pleasure of taking a course from Dr. Galston at U of Md. last year.  Rereading this review, it is quite consistent with the ideas he presented so well in class.a means to his proposed end, value pluralism, as a consensus rather than a revealed notion of the best type of arrangement that can be made for people to live in comity.

US	49999268	RRHO3NF06GRTD	0465090826	632135242	The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke	Books	5	20	24	N	N	An "A" for integrity, sympathy for the middle class	One mark of a good book is that there are already several thorough and complementary reviews here on Amazon.  Consider these points merely as supplements.<br />To reiterate the authors' primary point, middle class families are increasingly stretching to buy houses in neighborhoods with good schools.  They put themselves in a position in which they depend on both parents' incomes.  Any disruption of family life -- an illness, taking care of an elderly parent, losing a job and certainly a divorce -- throws the system out of balance and often puts unbearable financial pressure on the family.  The theme of the book is bankruptcy among families with children and how to prevent it.<br />The sharks gather when they smell blood in the water.  \\"Loan consolidators\\" and \\"loan to own\\" mortgage lenders press money on these weakened families at usurious rates.  The all-to-frequent result is that the lenders foreclose on the house and drive the families into bankruptcy.<br />The authors advocate government action to prevent predatory loan practices.  In my (conservative leaning) mind this pits two principles of government against one another.  One says that citizens are adults and should be able to make informed decisions about their own lives; we don't need the Government to protect us from getting fat eating at McDonalds. The other says that citizens must be protected from dangers they cannot adequately evaluate; we need the FDA to protect us from untested drugs.  In the case of lending, given the great harm that unscrupulous lenders can do to families, and the difficulty a family must have in evaluating the risks of taking on loan obligations, I must agree with the authors that a regulated loan environment makes sense.  We need usury laws such as were commonplace until a couple of decades ago.  Not coincidentally, Citibank is the most profitable corporation in America this quarter, surpassing every company such as Exxon, GM and Microsoft that actually makes things.  What DOES Citi do to make that money?  For a major clue, examine the flood of credit offers that show up daily in your mailbox.<br />The authors make a point of documenting Hillary Clinton's duplicity on this loan issue.  They say she was uncommonly bright, able to grasp the issue immediately when they presented it to her as First Lady.  As a senator from New York, however, she quickly abandoned the interests of the little guy for the financial support of New York bankers.<br />Though the \\"two income trap\\" affects women somewhat more than men the authors show an appealing sympathy for the poor guys in the equation.  They emphasize that most men do fulfill their child support obligations.  Divorced men are seldom a whole lot better off than the wives who (for the most part) make the choice to leave them.  The answer is not to squeeze more money out of the missing dads but to keep families from getting into trouble in the first place.<br />The search for good schooling is the most significant factor driving families to overcommit themselves financially.  This ties directly to the question of why public schools are failing.  In my view the courts' and government's fingerprints are all over this mess.  It is a classic case of elites in Washington, whose own kids are not affected because they go to private schools, attempting to eliminate longstanding and yet little understood problems they perceive in society by mandating solutions from above.  Solutions imposed on schools have involved using busing to disrupt the integrity of neighborhood schools, imposing sex education, removing any mention of religion, Title IX rearrangement of boys' and girls' athletics, imposition of standardized testing, homogenizing textbooks into a bland pap offensive to nobody.  Bottom line, nowhere are public schools what they used to be, and parents are involved in a spending war trying to find the closest remaining approximations by buying into the right neighborhoods.  Other reviewers have suggested home schooling and private schools as an alternate remedy.  Washington D.C. leads the way.

The staff and teachers of an individual school don't have the freedom to choose the materials they use for teaching.  This is wrong from the very start.  Teachers do a better job if they teach what they know.  I use can effectively use recipes in teaching fractions because I know about cooking.  If it is working for me, my kids are learning math, culture, a bit of reading and maybe a practical skill.  It wouldn't work at all for another teacher.<br />Now to Ravich's argument.  Textbook and text selections are made by state level committees in Texas and California.  These committees are subject to immense pressure from both left and right wing organizations on every conceivable subject: evolution, abortion, homosexuality, multiculturalism, and on down the line.<br />The textbook and test creators are businesspeople.  They want to avoid conflict.  They do it by reducing their products to the consistency of pap, inoffensive to everybody but by the same token uninspiring to everybody.  The states pick it and dictate that the teachers teach it.  I suppose it makes no difference to somebody whose vision of himself is as an automaton in a huge state bureaucracy, charged with dispensing small doses of standardized learning.  I am sure also that there are teachers who reluctantly adopt the role of automatons and teach what is given them.<br />People with passion are ditching the public schools.  I have had kids in, taught and served as a board member of private schools.  All of them in our area are swamped with applications.  Why?  The teachers really care.  A big part of that caring is that the teachers can choose what they teach.  They do it according to their own interests and the skills of the makeup of their individual classes.  They meet frequently to make sure that their curricula fit together year to year and across courses.<br />I thought about political correctness Thursday as I substituted for a Spanish class.  As the classroom teacher had left an assignment for the students to work on, I was able to engage a very intelligent Marxist in a discussion in Spanish about the revolution by the indigenous people in Chiapas, Mexico.  Public school would never entertain materials on either Sandinistas or Contras, or for that matter, any significant dialog about Palestinians and Israelis.  Sad, because it is issues like these, in which the kids are invested, that lead to the best teaching and learning.<br />Homeschoolers have grown from a few thousand to a couple of million over the last two decades.  The moms I have talked to are passionate about letting their kids select an interest and pursue it.  One kid liked Chinese food, then saw a picture of the Great Wall of China in a picture taken from space.  He spent a month visiting museums, reading and writing about Chinese history.  What is most profound is that this student liked school and this teacher liked teaching.  Why?  Because they did it their way.  I hardly need to add that the standard pose of most schoolkids is total boredom.  It is more than an affectation.<br />I've digressed to a bigger issue, the fact that almost every aspect of public education is highly standardized, highly politicized and highly bureaucratized.  Ravich's book shines an intense light one nasty symptom within a far more pervasive syndrome.They meet frequently to make sure that their curricula fit together year to year and across courses.<br />I thought about political correctness Thursday as I substituted for a Spanish class.

With such a gift he should say more.<br />He makes a good case against the War on Drugs as it pertains to marijuana.  He gives the history of Harry Anslinger, the DEA, the politicos from the 40s through today.  He tells how the crop is grown, harvested and distributed.  How it has benefited from agricultural advances.<br />He'll sell a ton of copies because of &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;.  A far better book, by a guy who lost blood earning his story, is &quot;The Big White Lie&quot; by Michael Levine.  I flog this book because it is out of print and seems to have had a short run.  A chapter is available in &quot;Into the Buzzsaw&quot;<br />Though Schlosser is sympathetic to the immigrants he limns in his second and shortest essay, he does not venture much in the way of suggestions as to a policy for dealing with them.  Of the many books on the subject I most highly recommend the section from &quot;Diversity in America&quot;.  For well reasoned though passionate positions on the matter see online research by the Human Biodiversity Institute.<br />As for porn, so what?  Like it or not there isn't much we can do about it.

Profound thesis, fascinating trivia	Jensen's definitions and descriptions of his science are fascinating.  g stands for General Ability.  It is neither IQ nor intelligence itself.  Intelligence, per Jensen, is the capacity of all animals to perceive and act upon the natural world.<br />The Intelligence Quotient is a statistical artifice that maps individuals' problem solving abilities into a linear scale according to a Gaussian bell-curve distribution.  By definition the average IQ is 100 and the standard deviation (SD) 15.  By the properties of the bell curve approximately 2/3 of the population falls within one SD of the median, that is, between 85 and 115.<br />However, as Jensen points out repeatedly, general ability is not a linear function.  The discriminators are whether or not an individual can solve specific problems.  There is no way to define a lineal relationship between two individuals if once can figure out (for instance) the lowest primo number greater than 90 and another cannot, or one can figure that context requires the word above to be \\"prime\\" not \\"primo\\" and another cannot.  There is no metric for \\"g\\" itself.  Rather, all tests of mental ability have a degree of \\"g loading.\\"  Psychometrics is the science of assessing and manipulating information about a quality that cannot be measured directly.<br />Jensen devotes much energy to defending the validity of \\"g\\", this thing that defies direct measurement.  It is real because:<br />a) It is statistically \\"there.\\"  It is highly correlated among myriad tests.<br />b) It works in the real world.  There is no single discriminator that approaches the value of \\"g\\", usually proxied by an IQ test score, as a predictor of educational or job performance.<br />c) It has equal predictive power for both sexes, all ages and all populations of mankind.  It is independent (as he takes endless pages to prove) of race, language and socio-economic status (SES).<br />d) Many seemingly unrelated kinds of tests all turn out to measure the same thing.  Tests may be verbal or pictorial, or may simply measure the time it takes to react to and act upon a visual or auditory stimulus.<br />e) By adulthood it no longer has much to do with advantages such as hearing Mozart in the womb or a Montessori kindergarten, or disadvantages such as Jim Crow and slavery.<br />The other reviews of this book are quite good.  Some of Jensen's many fascinating observations:<br />o Incest is a bad idea.  The offspring have a significant intelligence deficit.<br />o Smart parents, alas, can't count on having equally smart kids.  On average their intelligence regresses halfway back to the mean (100 for white Americans).  On the bright side, the average people manage by dumb luck to produce enough smarties for each succeeding generation.<br />o Breast feeding makes a huge difference, about 7 IQ points.  Blacks do not breast feed as often or as long as whites.  Big, easy change to make in society.<br />o The factors generally agreed to comprise \\"g\\" differ among races and sexes.  Blacks exceed whites in short term memory.  Men exceed women in spatial intelligence.  When the many individual factors are aggregated they reveal different means for different races, with whites in the middle with an average of 100.<br />o Individuals with IQs below 70 are generally considered to be retarded.  White retarded kids frequently look and act somehow different, while retarded kids of other races are more normal in terms of socialization, motor skills and energy.  This is related to the two types of retardation, familial and organic.  In simple words, there is something \\"wrong with\\" an organically retarded child.  A bad forceps delivery, spina difida or one of a number of identifiable anomalies.  Familial retardation, on the other hand, simply represents a bad spin of the chromosomal wheel of fortune that is sexual reproduction.  The odds are higher in populations whose median IQs are lower.<br />o Cause for concern: If Vanhansen and Lynn are right in \\"IQ and the Wealth of Nations\\" there are perhaps a dozen countries in which the average citizen would be considered retarded and hence marginally educable by U.S. standards.<br />o Illiteracy is not always a matter of reading.  Below the threshold of retardation people often have the same inability to understand a sentence whether it is written or spoken.  The issue is having enough \\"g\\" to make sense out of the words.<br />o People with lower IQs are markedly more fertile than those with higher IQs.  This dysgenic (opposite of eugenic) trend stands to lower \\"g\\" within the U.S. population.  Average intelligence will of course remain at 100 because by definition it is the population mean.<br />Jensen comes across through this book as first and foremost an inquisitive mind, a scientist.  He often states with unashamed candor that he (nor anybody else) knows the answer to some knotty problems of psychometrics, like the Flynn effect that shows overall intelligence rising 3 points per generation.  Contrast his thoroughness and openness with the tone of advocacy found in Stephen Jay Gould (Mismeasure of Man) and sites such as fairtest dot org.  Steven Pinker describes  in \\"The Blank Slate, the Modern Denial of Human Nature\\" the extreme and prolonged abuse Jensen has taken from the academic community.  I'm happy to report he hasn't lost his sense of balance.  Or sense of humor.h of Nations\\" there are perhaps a dozen countries in which the average citizen would be considered retarded and hence marginally educable by U.S. standards.   <BR>o Illiteracy is not always a matter of reading.

Tom Wicker's thesis in &quot;Tragic Failure&quot; subtitle &quot;Racial Integration in America&quot; is that racial integration simply has not worked.  He would support the William O. Douglas / Thurgood Marshall line of thought that the job of integration will only be complete when most neighborhoods and schools are visibly multi-racial and all races enjoy substantially equal prestige and incomes.  He would argue that government, especially the courts, have much more work to do.<br />Wicker's apologia for persistent educational and economic underperformance he roots in two centuries of  slavery and another of Jim Crow.  He sees a vicious cycle of undereducation, low self esteem, illegitimacy and drug dependency that will apparently perpetuate itself until it is broken by the acceptance of minorities as equal citizens, that to be achieved by force of law.<br />Both authors observe that the courts went from one extreme, the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine of Plessy vs. Ferguson. to a middle ground with &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education,&quot; to the highly interventionist phase of forced busing in the 1970s, to return to a rather muddled middle ground in the 1990's, with mandatory busing being phased out and increased tolerance of de facto segregation resulting from residential patterns.<br />David J. Armor served as an expert witness in many school desegregation cases, including those involving forced busing.  &quot;Forced Justice&quot; offers the legal history of school desegregation, an analysis of the &quot;harm and benefits&quot; theory behind integration, an assessment of the extent to which desegregation yielded the expected benefits, and a snapshot of the status quo as of his writing in 1995, forty some years after Brown vs. Board of Education.<br />Though court decisions drove the most divisive aspects of school desegregation, The Supreme Court chose to accept only a fraction of the cases presented for review and rendered opinions that were vague enough that lower courts were able to interpret them in many different ways.  In some cases, such as Mecklenburg, North Carolina and Pasadena, California the courts came close to running the schools.  Fear of extensive judicial involvement led many districts to institute some form of voluntary desegregation using devices such as magnet schools.<br />Armor is at pains to point out that human affairs are far too complex to permit controlled experimentation with ideas such as desegregation.  The races are segregated by neighborhood.  Is that a matter of race, class, or simple preference?  Does it cause or result from school segregation?  To what extent can school boards be held accountable for it?<br />Measurement is also difficult.  What can be measured is that the schools' racial mixture changed rapidly and radically in many school districts undergoing desegregation.  Student performance is also measured, though only by broad categories.  It is difficult to know how to distinguish among the numerous factors that can student performance, among them the trauma of desegregation, racial prejudice and self esteem issues, the stress of being bused, socioeconomic status and native ability.<br />Regression analysis is the statistician's tool for mathematically isolating the many variables in a complex  set of data.  Armor's before-and-after analyses of student performance in districts that desegregated yield two recurrent results:  &quot;No measurable different&quot; and &quot;We don't know.&quot;  In particular:<br />Black self esteem appears to be if anything higher than whites,' and it is highest in majority black schools, worst in those that are more evenly mixed, and better in schools in which blacks are a distinct minority.<br />Both black and white academic performance are worst in predominantly black schools.  However, adjusting for socioeconomic status, blacks seem to do as well in urban schools as the suburban schools to which they are frequently bused.<br />Each race's estimation of the other is lowest in those situations in which they have a maximum of contact.  In other words, less mixing actually led to better mutual relations.<br />White academic performance appears to be largely unaffected by the addition of a substantial minority of black students.  The fears driving white flight appear unfounded.  White academic achievement has been static over the forty year period under study.  Black academic achievement has risen, though it still remains a significant fraction of a standard deviation below that of whites.<br />Armor's bottom line is that desegregation was an immensely costly effort.  The out-of-pocket expense involved in legal proceedings, busing, construction and other remedies could only have been justified by significant, measurable benefits.  The actual benefits are at best mixed.  One clear benefit is more intense focus on equalizing levels of spending on education, though there too, the correspondence between spending and results is hard to discern.<br />Wicker's bottom line is that African Americans have received pretty much as much help as they can expect from the political system.  He advocates that &quot;African-Americans themselves must take the lead, state the goal (economic advance and social leveling), and move boldly towards it.&quot;  Armor would advocate something similar.  Blacks need to decide what structure is best suited to provide them with &quot;equity&quot; and work within existing systems to achieve it.  One despairs that judicial solutions are too much to hope for, the other that they have been tried and have not worked.

Some such ends are achievable and others not.  Many are not worth the financial and costs of achieving them, and some ends are not even honorable.<br />Schuck performs the great service of offering definitions of the diverse collection of societal objects that comprise diversity itself.  From the top, there is observed diversity.  America has always been a diverse country, made up of different peoples, languages, religions and customs.  In our sometimes ignoble past we attempted to limit that diversity by immigration laws, Jim Crow and other means.  Nevertheless, the founders recognized the diversity that existed and seemed to promote it as an antidote to any specific group's ability to amass excessive power.<br />The metric of diversity means different things to different groups.  It most often means visible diversity by skin color, the \\"ethno-racial pentagon\\" of Caucasian, African, Native American, Asian and Latin American peoples.  Crudely put, white, black, red, yellow and brown.  Schuck points out that this photographically demonstrable diversity along the single axis of ethnic origins often hides a stunning uniformity of political liberalism and religious (un)belief.  Diversity in schools has to be taken to mean a diversities in ability to learn and therefore the amount of resources needed to enable a student to realize a given level of achievement.  And, for that matter, just to maintain order.<br />Diversity as a starry-eyed ideal is peculiar to 20th century America and Canada.  That is to say, one never saw \\"Celebrate Diversity\\" bumper stickers on Conastoga wagons.  As they dodged the arrows of diverse populations.  The particulars of timing are different depending on whether one is talking about religious or racial diversity or multiculturalism.  Since before the Revolution many elements of our diverse society had been revulsed by the exclusion of African Americans from education and mainstream society.  With the civil rights movement diversity came to be seen not only as an indication of legal equity in society but as a desirable end in itself.  A norm of society.<br />Our society has used many devices to advance the cause of racial diversity.  Conscience is one.  Universities and corporations adopted diversity programs because their leadership deemed it the right thing to do.  Guilt is another, remedying past discrimination.  A third is common business sense.  A company that sells to a diverse clientele should present a diverse face to the public.  Schuck gives greatest attention to a fourth, legislative and judicial efforts to force diversity in the realms of educational and corporate affirmative action, immigration, multiculturalism and housing.  He follows the legal proceedings in exhaustive detail.<br />Schuck's bottom line is that \\"government... should use its bully pulpit to praise diversity in general and even particular diversities...But it should not try to create or promote any particular kind of diversity.\\"  His reasons are pragmatic.  Forcing diversity goes against other widely held cultural values, such as the belief that people should achieve their place in society by merit and that they should be free to associate with people of their choosing.  Court mandated residential integration, affirmative action and busing have created great resentment.  The reactions, such as white flight and foot dragging, have had enormous costs and on balance have hurt rather than helped the minorities' cause.  While it is easy to ascertain that segregation was enforced by the law, it is impossible to know whether the continued separation of races by neighborhoods is a matter of discrimination or simple personal preference.  It was easy in the days of \\"separate but equal\\" to ascribe poor academic performance to poor schools.

Most amusing are Ted Kennedy's labors to favor the Irish over all other Europeans.  It is illogical that we take no advantage of the immense attractiveness of American residency to demand that immigrants bring with them any particular skills or education.

He is especially eloquent on the subject of the government's inability to find a focus or a common policy to unite its diverse and contradictory policies.  His subtitle is \\"Keeping government at a safe distance.\\"  Despite the fact that he includes a section with just that title, Schuck is notably incurious about the \\"root causes\\" inequities in society, ascribing them all to past inequalities in social station and education even while acknowledging that different minorities have shown markedly different success in overcoming these handicaps that all had in common.

It is why people come from all over the country to see him in North Carolina.  I am sure he wishes as ardently as anybody that his genius were transferrable.  While this book gives one an appreciation of his methods, it also highlights how subjective the judgments really are.  Any parent who has been through the rounds of physical therapists, speech therapists, child psychologists, ritalin, Prozac, tutors, school counsellors, etc. etc. will know that not all experts have the same powers of perception, and they certainly don't all agree.<br />I of course love the advice with which I agree.  Turn off the TV!  Have the kids read.  Practice writing.  He gives some very concrete and useful advice on how to do this... forms you can copy and suggest that your child's teachers hand out with assignments.<br />As another reviewer suggests, examining the unique balance of skills and weaknesses in each child, and tailoring life and learning plans to meet their special needs, takes a tremendous amount of resources.  Public school classroom teachers charged with 35 young minds, or a modestly paid and trained counsellor responsible for a whole school cannot possibly be expected to handle every child's issues.<br />There are always alternatives -- many, confusing and conflicting -- for parents with the money and time to investigate them.  The sad reality is that society just can't devote enough resources to give all kids the attention that would benefit them.  How to apply Levine's insights and techniques to as many kids as possible within what voters are willing to spend is an interesting question.	2003-07-11

US	49999268	R1MK5XVOH0ZH3U	027597510X	292343004	IQ and the Wealth of Nations	Books	5	62	75	N	Y	This book demands a rebuttal.  Where is it?	Our society forms social policy, most recently the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action in Michigan, on the premise that all racial groups are equal.  Not Lincoln's \\"all men are equal under the law\\" but \\"all men are equal\\".<br />We observe inequality in every aspect of life, most notably educational achievement and financial status.  If, as society assumes, all people are equally capable of achievement, there has to be a conspiracy holding some peoples down.  And what is it?  White racism, they say, as if it could not be more obvious.  Well hidden, but still manifest in \\"low expectations\\" and \\"subtle disparagement\\" etc.  We white guys have broad shoulders, but jeez, it gets old after a while.  Blacks and liberals have such low opinions of our fundamental morality, we descendants of the abolitionists who freed the slaves and were active partners of the NAACP over the years.  It could start to affect our self esteem.<br />A similar conspiracy theory appears at the international level.  African countries supposedly remain poor because they have been exploited by more advanced nations.  Their attempts at industrialization supposedly fall victim to greedy foreign companies through a scheme of \\"globalization\\" that values them only for their raw materials and cheap labor.  Just as the racism theory holds that we white guys are in cahoots to hold minorities down, this one assumes an evil alliance among large companies and advanced countries to depress the market value of the labor and raw materials produced by developing countries.  Oppression is a rhetorical staple at the U.N.<br />It has been almost 10 years since \\"The Bell Curve\\" appeared.  Since that time many other books have appeared that appear to support its arguments that peoples are different in statistically significant ways, among them \\"IQ and the Wealth of Nations\\", \\"The g factor,\\" \\"Race, Evolution and Behavior,\\" \\"Genes, Peoples and Languages,\\" and Steven Pinker's \\"The Blank Slate.\\"<br />As Pinker so eloquently reports, these books have been vilified by academics.  Typical is Peter Irons writing in \\"Jim Crow's Children\\" that \\"virtually all reputable scholars reject claims, most recently leveled by Richard Herrenstein and Charles Murray..\\" or Hugh Price disparaging \\"scientifically discredited\\" theories of intelligence in \\"Achievement Matters\\" or Tom Wicker writing in \\"Tragic Failure\\" that \\"...the Bell Curve... received much condemnation as pseudoscience.\\"  Strikingly absent from all these well annotated books are footnotes in support of these claims.  Who are these \\"reputable scholars\\" who have \\"discredited\\" these books?  Peter Irons offers one name, that of Richard Nisbett, who has authored no books on the subject but does post a 16-page (triple-spaced) bit on his web site.  Price and Wicker offer none.  The most prominent debunker, Stephen Jay Gould in \\"The Mismeasure of Man,\\" rather than offering a statistical rebuttal, attacks the premise that statistical analysis is meaningful.  He does, of course, cite a few studies that support his case.<br />The policy implications are vast.  If all peoples are equally capable we must find and do away with whatever prejudices are holding some back.  If all peoples are not equal we have to fall back a century or so and reconsider the white man's burden.  What is the obligation of more richly endowed individuals and nations to the less richly endowed?  If society is a Darwinist struggle between equally capable combatants, some simply more industrious than others, one would not have too much sympathy for the losers.  If the struggle is truly unequal the humanitarian thing to do is to redistribute wealth.  It is probably also the smart thing to do -- buy peace.  Give Marx partial credit, though redistributing all of it as under Communism proved to be a disaster.  Amy Chua's recommends in \\"World on Fire\\" that \\"market dominant minorities\\" like Jews and Chinese curry favor by giving back to their adoptive countries.<br />Whatever the story, policy should be based on knowledge.  Would some \\"reputable scholar\\" please step forward to poke holes in Messrs. Lynn and VanHansen's argument?  If that proves impossible the U.N. might have to take their arguments into consideration.  Imagine what it would do to that body's self esteem.r the story, policy should be based on knowledge.

A graduate of Harvard Law school.  He does a magnificent job of presenting the history of Jim Crow from a legal perspective.  It is a splendid refresher course in High School Civics: The Dred Scott decision that negroes were property; Plessy vs. Ferguson establishing the doctrine of &#34;Separate but Equal,&#34; and the myriad cases argued by Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP leading up to the desegregation decision in &#34;Brown vs. Board of Education.&#34;<br />Segregation advocates recognized even fifty years ago that their arguments for separate schools were weak in light of the 14th Amendment.  The surprise is the degree to which the Warren Court took psychological testimony, the self esteem argument, into account.  Separate schools, they concluded, could not be equal simply because of the stigma that separation imposed on black children.  Full and equal citizens must enjoy the right to participate fully and equally in the society.<br />The book traces the progress of desegregation from 1954 onward, including busing and other measures to force integration.  Mr. Irons laments the limited success of these measures in achieving their objective, equal educational and financial achievement by blacks in an integrated society.<br />Why, then, do differences persist?  Mr. Irons argues that ongoing differences result from continued de facto separation of the races in schools, the inferior economic status of blacks, and the high incidence of single mothers among the black population.  These situations perpetuate a cycle of lower expectations, lower self-esteem and lower achievement among blacks.  Take them away, he suggests, and blacks would perform at the same level as everyone else in society.<br />Mr. Irons takes the obligatory swipe at &#34;The Bell Curve,&#34; leading with the phrase &#34;Virtually all reputable scholars reject claims, most recently leveled by Richard Herrenstein and Charles Murray.....who conducted no research of their own.&#34;  It is true that they saw their task as compilation..  They acknowledged that the relationships among social status, income, intelligence and race are vastly complex.  Their goal was to bring together and analyze all the significant statistical data from diverse studies in many countries over many decades.  Though one would not know it from the reception it got, the book is not even primarily about race.  Mr. Irons did not footnote his claim about &#34;all reputable scholars.&#34; The only one he cites, Richard Nisbett, has not written a book on the subject, only a 16-page tract entitled &#34;Race Genetics and IQ,&#34; ..It cites a handful of studies with limited numbers of subjects dating mostly from the 1930s to the 1970s.  Mr. Irons chooses to ignore a number of published authors he must regard as disreputable, among them William Shockley, Arthur Jensen, and Philippe Rushton.  Whatever their shortcomings, they have published books to offer their thoughts for public scrutiny.  Mr. Irons should not have ducked the chance to refute them.<br />Mr. Irons is totally focused on U.S. society.  The book would be richer, though his thesis would be more difficult to support, if he were to consider the situation of blacks elsewhere in the world.  He would find that whatever their situation with regard to education and income, the degree of equality between blacks and whites in the U.S far exceeds that in any other part of the world, including Africa, Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America.  Jim Crow is a weak explanation for the status of blacks in France or Haiti.<br />Thinkers throughout the history of our country, including great minds such as deTocqueville Twain and Mencken have devoted a great deal of thought to the natures of the races and relationships between them.  While there is no agreement, all would say it is tremendously complex.  School integration and busing were simple ideas that had their opportunity to resolve the situation.  They didn't.  We can thank Mr. Irons for a wonderful history lesson.  Sadly, his thinking is trapped in his own history.history lesson.  Sadly, his thinking is trapped in his own history.	2003-06-28

Why haven't all the prescriptions for fixing race relations worked?  Is it that a racist conspiracy, of course well hidden, is pervasive throughout the land?  Or are there other explanations for the different outcomes and behaviors of the races?<br />Ms. Lasch-Quinn makes those painful connections and comparisons for them.  Between the \\"low self esteem\\" theory and the fact that those presumed to have low self esteem are in fact loaded with that quality.  They just aren't intellectually very capable and they don't control their impulses.  Between the \\"hurt feelings\\" school of dealing with diversity and the fact that people express rage more because it works and they can get away with it than for any other reason.  Between the notion that whites \\"ought to to more\\" and the minority communities' often virulent rejection of their proferred assistance, unless it comes in the form of money or concessions.<br />As you will note from other reviewers' comments, minds are made up on this matter.  Lasch-Quinn should not expect thanks from newly enlightened lefties.<br />Recommend that readers interested in the scientific aspects of the issue read \\"The Blank Slate\\" by Steven Pinker and \\"Genes, Peoples and Languages\\" by Cavalli-Sforza.  Both are troubling to diversity advocates in academia although both go out of their way to avoid saying anything about differences in ability or achievement between the races.  Their theses do, however, undermine the notion that it is illogical to think there would be differences.  The next question to ask is whether people have researched such differences and what have they found?  Oh. Turns out they have. And why are their findings so successfully supressed and vilified, but never refuted?	2003-06-24

Temes' central thesis is that nothing succeeds with any kind of student, from the most brilliant to the slowest, like devoted and intelligent teachers.<br />It isn't the curriculum, it isn't how many hours of sex ed they get, it isn't the standardized tests.  It's the amount of time and effort the teacher spends working to inspire young minds.<br />Not surprisingly, a top-down approach \\"designed by geniuses to be implemented by idiots\\" is bound to fail.  Teachers are idiosyncratic human beings.  Each one will have his or her own approach to teaching, and if they are any good they will never teach the same class twice.  The subject matter evolves, the teacher keeps learning, and the personalities in each class are different.<br />Temes' plea is for administrators to see their role as protecting the teachers from bureaucratic intrusion and hiring the best possible teachers.  The role of education schools ought to be, as much as anything else, getting smarter people into education.  Education majors today are at the bottom of the heap intellectually, about 100 points below the median on SAT scores.  It is perverse that teaching is a job from which it is hard to get fired, and from which the only promotion paths lead out of the classroom.  Temes quotes many administrators on the reality of the situation: 20% of classroom teachers are total losses, another 60% are capable of being inspired but often aren't, and maybe 20%, in a good system, are truly dedicated.<br />A short anecdote.  I listen to the lunchroom conversation in my stints as a substitute teacher.  In private school the conversation is usually about kids and curriculum.  In public school it is about benefits and retirement.	2003-06-24

Avoid the finger of blame	Why is it that a white guy writes the first review of this book, a year after its publication?<br />Mr. Price is absolutely right on the basics.  Kids need to apply themselves in school.  It teaches skills that are absolutely essential in life.  How to acquire information, how to use it to form an opinion, and how to express that opinion.  It also provides you with the foundation in mathematics and logic that is indispensable for thinking through problems both easy and hard.<br />His prescription is irrefutable.  He calls for parents to be involved.  Know what the school is teaching and how it assigns your child to a teacher.  Know what the kids are doing after school.  Know their friends.  Know what they are watching on TV.  Given that you can't keep them from listening to rap music, at least have an open discussion with them about the values being expressed.<br />He is right that black kids underperform kids of other races.  They tend to become discouraged and adopt a defeatist attitude.  More than that, kids who are not doing well spitefully drag down the kids who try, accusing them of &quot;acting white.&quot;  Everybody in education has wrestled with this set of problems, first to figure out what to do, and second to ascribe blame.<br />Here's where I take issue with Mr. Price.  The blame invariably comes around to white folks.  His book is full of charged words, among them racism, discrimination and low expectations.  Many teachers of all races, based on their experience, come to have lower expectations of black kids.  It is equally true that they are prudent to keep these opinions to themselves.  But is this cause or effect?<br />Black authors, from Frederick Douglass through Larry Elder and Thomas Sowell, have made the same observations about African American students.  Mr. Price points out that black kids tend to be channeled into special ed when the &quot;act out&quot; too much. He notes that after school programs are essential to keep kids from getting involved in crime and getting pregnant.  He notes that there is a strong strain of anti-intellectualism in black popular culture. I cringe at the messages white kids pick up from black rappers and even from the Disney after-school programs with predominantly black casts.  Was Bill Cosby the only black entertainer who offered a realistic and uplifting message?  Do you ever hear of a similar problems with Vietnamese Americans?<br />Black students in the United States have higher levels of achievement than blacks anywhere else in the world.  Brazil, with little acknowledged discrimination, is a disaster for blacks in terms of both education and income.  Ditto the Caribbean, and the Caribbean coasts of Central American countries.  The few native African scholars tend to work in the U.S.  Some, like John Ogbu, embarrass the American black establishment with books like his &quot; Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement.&quot;  Price could have provided footnotes when he disparaged &quot;scientifically discredited&quot; theories of intelligence.  Can he reference authoritative rebuttals to the works of Murray and Herrenstein, Arthur Jensen and Philippe Rushton?<br />The school systems in the Washington D.C. area are mostly headed by black superintendents.  Most have largely black boards and black faculties.  There are many factors to discourage white teachers from working in these systems.  A well-meaning teacher was chased out by angry parents in the &quot;Nappy Hair&quot; incident.  The Washington Post chronicled the unfortunate experiences of some Ivy League liberal white teachers starting in the D.C. system.  Teachers, black and white alike, are often intimidated and occasionally beaten up.  Whatever the problems, it is hard any more to lay them at the feet of white administrators.<br />There is no disputing the widespread discrimination that existed under Jim Crow.  On the other hand, there is no disputing that talented individuals like Clarence Thomas, Thomas Sowell, Condi Rice, Kenneth Chennault, Mr. Price himself and many, many others have overcome these difficulties to make sterling careers for themselves.  I would call on Mr. Price to abandon blaming the white guy because it just isn't useful.  Society has changed a lot, and more name-calling isn't likely to result in further beneficial change.  It obscures areas where progress can be made.<br />Teachers are only human.  Each of us have only finite intelligence and finite energy.  We allocate our energies to those efforts that will yield the greatest reward.  Mr. Price is na√Øve to say &quot;children are entitled to the best education possible.&quot;  No, children will get the education they and their parents demand.<br />Mr. Price overlooks the excellent option of private schools.  Most target about 10% of their tuitions for financial aid.  All are committed to the vague term &quot;diversity.&quot;  They actively seek and give preferential admission to black students.  The schools recognize that it is a stretch for the kids.  The portion of tuition they still must pay is significant.  They often have to travel across town.  Kids and parents are cliquish, sometimes excluding or patronizing black kids.  But the kids who can put up with this atmosphere gain the benefit of small classes and bright and well-meaning teachers.  The schools go out of their way to arrange tutors and whatever other support the kids need.  The kids learn the essential life skill of moving comfortably in white society.  And even if, as is often the case, they do not do as well in school as the other kids, they find that their social skills and athletic abilities always earn them a respected place in the school community.  I hope that Mr. Price can recognize that while it is certainly true that &quot;achievement matters,&quot; different peoples realize disproportionate achievements in different fields.<br />The common denominators of success are hard work, respect for community and family values, respect for the individual, a willingness to see each person as an individual.

The situation differs from continent to continent.  Ethnic Chinese dominate many Southeast Asian economies, basically everything from Burma eastward.  Overseas Indians and a few local tribes are the entrepreneurs of East Africa and Lebanese share West Africa with the locals.  Former colonials, of course, retain important roles in South Africa, Zimbabwe and a few other countries.<br />The notion of \\"Market Dominant Minorities\\" plays out somewhat differently in Europe, especially the newly capitalistic Russia.  There, in less than a generation, long suppressed Jews, representing something like 1% of the population, have become the tycoons.  Latin America, mixture that it is of European, Native American and African bloodlines, is a different situation.  Nonetheless as Mrs. Chua points out, the elites have a decidedly white cast.<br />And why is this a dangerous situation?  Because democracy puts the majority in control.  Rule of law is not sufficient to prevent them from expropriating the wealth of the minorities.  Or worse -- killing and looting, such as the Chinese minority suffered in Indonesia, whites have suffered in Zimbabwe, and Tutsis suffered at the hands of Hutus in Rwanda.  She expands her thesis to explain that the USA dominates the world economy much as Chinese and others dominate certain nations, and that 9-11 was an expression of the rage and frustration of countries that find themselves unable to compete with the US.<br />Miss Chua cites Thomas Friedman, \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\\", to refute his optimism, and Samuel Huntington and Thomas Sowell as supporting authors.  Still, in the end she finds no reason why certain minorities always seem to wind up on top.<br />I think that the Chinese Mrs. Chua is being modest and disingenuous.  I would suggest that she read the black Mr. Sowell more deeply.  There are significant differences among peoples.  At a minimum they are, as Mr. Sowell suggests in \\"Race and Culture,\\" cultural.  Other authors, among them Lynn and VanHansen in \\"IQ and the Wealth of Nations, Arthur Jensen in \\"The g Factor\\", and Murray and Herrenstein in \\"The Bell Curve\\" see significant differences in average intelligence among peoples, with Jews and Chinese like the Chua-Rubenfelds likely to be at the top of the heap.<br />Folks in academia shy away from this conclusion.  MIT's Steven Pinker dances around it in his excellent \\"The Blank Slate.\\"  Stanford's Luigi Cavalli-Sforza lays out a wealth of excellent research on human evolution in \\"Genes, Peoples and Languages\\" but declines to follow where it might lead.  Jared Diamond makes a powerful case in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" that accidents of geography gave Asians and Europeans a tremendous cultural endowment, but declines to consider that evolution might have favored intelligence these among peoples with a richer material culture to manage.  And now Mrs. Chua feigns having no notion of what might be special about her own people that makes them bubble to the top in situation after situation, with or without education, connections, or seed capital, and despite formidable obstacles.<br />For only one reason would I endorse her reticence.  If some peoples turn out to be smarter than others there isn't much we can do about it.  One might twist Christ's words to say, \\"the smart will always be with you.\\"  Moreover, they will always be a minority.  As savants from Malthus to Herbert Spencer have remarked, the smart and the rich don't seem to be terribly fertile.  Maybe they have found something more fun than sex?<br />Her most trenchant observation, that the rich should find ways to buy off the poor, is probably the best wisdom in the book.  It happens in the US.  Our government redistributes wealth in any number of ways.  Rich folks from Carnegie through Rockefeller, Gates and Soros, well fixed unto the third generation, have given away vast sums.  More than democracy, then, the U.S. needs to export a philosophy of philanthropy and even welfare.<br />One further observation.  Large numbers of Jews, Chinese and other smart folks in the United States are, like Mrs. Chua herself, sufficiently confident of their material survival that they eschew crass lucre for the pursuit of ideas.

See review of the same title, author Gabriel Sagal)<br /><br />I got this assuming it was a cookbook. I wanted its recipe for its chimichurri. The chimichurri was great, but it turned out to be a wonderfully humorous, lighthearted book about cooking and eating, Argentine style.<br /><br />Argentines dedicate their lives to the asado, a ritual that involves steak, chicken, sausages and animal parts that Americans would not eat even if they were in sausages. They are purists, true to their gaucho heritage: build the BBQ out of rock or brick, fuel it with wood and use iron as necessary to hold the meat. Sagel's disparaging comments on American techniques like briquettes, starter fluid and gas grills are riotous.<br /><br />It is about five years since I read this. I'm ordering more copies to give to my middle school Spanish class. They'll love it.	2003-04-16

True to his title, he compares leftist thinkers throughout the ages and especially the 20th century.  To his credit he considers communism a massive failure and says he is optimistic about America.  He points out that these views separate him from many of his colleagues on the Left.<br />What should the Left's agenda be today?  As best I can tell -- Rorty would rather use other's words than his own -- it includes achieving a classless society, a casteless society, \\"social justice,\\" which may be another name for the same things, and \\"an end to sadism\\" such as has been systematically experienced by women, gays, minorities, etc. etc.<br />Rorty appears trapped in a time warp.  He perceives groups, not the people of whom they consist, and society's ills as the evils (immiseration, to use his word) imposed on one group by another.  Wasn't this the classic flaw in Marxist thinking?  To deny the humanity of the individual by treating all as groups?  Proletariat good, Kulaks bad, capitalists worse, and members of the Party, without flaw until we liquidate you?<br />The science of our day has been moving away from Rorty for several decades.  The premise that people are in any way uniform in their innate abilities, character, personality traits and all other measures has been exhaustively studied and found to be untenable.  Marx notes as much in saying \\"from each according to his abilities.\\"  Dramatic developments in the studies of genetics and evolution point to facts that were once observed and accepted as common knowledge, that there are meaningful differences among groups of people as well.<br />The core question is, given that people and groups of people are differently endowed with the talents that result in success in modern society, what is social justice?<br />Rorty does not take the first step, which is to recognize that inequalities in social position, wealth, etc. correlate at least to some degree to discrepancies in industry, intelligence and other personal traits.  Instead he puts the blame on other groups in society:  \\"Sadism was recognized as having deeper roots  than economic insecurity. The delicious pleasure to be had  from creating a class of putative inferiors and then humiliating individual members of that class was seen as Freud saw  it-as something which would be relished even if everybody  were rich.\\"  It's still kill the kulacks and capitalists time as far as Rorty is concerned.<br />The argument he needs to make, but cannot find, is to define what social justice means in a society whose individual members are differently endowed.  It surely starts with legal justice: equal protection under the law.  It surely also must go further, to provide some safety net for members of society whose talents are not in demand in the labor markets, whether due to genetic inheritance, injury, age or whatever.  The nature and level of that safety net must be a matter of public debate, as must the question of what to do with sociopaths and others dangerous to their peers.<br />Rorty missed a turn on the road of philosophy.  Those with something meaningful to say in this age are knowledgeable about science.  Start with Darwin and go through Dennett, Dawkins, Gould, Hrdy, Summers, Carvalli-Sforza and others, at least see what Jensen, Murray and Herrenstein have to say, and wind up with Pinker's amazingly good \\"The Blank Slate.\\"  Poor Rorty is dealing with the cold ashes of dead philosophies.l position, wealth, etc. correlate at least to some degree to discrepancies in industry, intelligence and other personal traits.

His own thoughts are good enough that he didn't need to lean on current heavies from Harvard or big names from bygone eras.<br />His point is that standardized tests aren't the answer, but before we deal with them we need to focus on the problem they address.  Are kids getting what they need out of school?  What can and should be expected from them?  Are schools organized optimally to deliver education?<br />His assessment of the need:  Kids need the basics -- reading, writing and arithmetic.  Today's kids need a richer dose of the following: 1) exposure to adults, along with understanding and approval; 2) ability to work in teams; 3) training in citizenship.  He relates the need to the labor marketplace in which workers increasingly need to work with and exchange ideas.  He says that what they need is &quot;Emotional Intelligence,&quot; one of those trendy concepts that has so swept the pedagogues that the latest evidence of my fossil status my 13-year-old has dug up is a lack of &quot;EQ.&quot;  However trendy, it remains true that kids need to be socialized, though I can't imagine it ever being unimporant.<br />Wagner recognizes that standard tests do not measure kids' individuality.  They learn differently.  They have different abilities to learn.  Furthermore, teachers aren't robots.  Different teachers have differing approaches.  He recommends that parents have the freedom to choose schools that are appropriate to the needs of their children.  He provides strong evidence that it can be done within the context of a public school system.<br />One of the strongest points Wagner makes is that a teacher's effectiveness is related to the amount of respect they get from their employer and the extent to which they can choose their own teaching style and materials.  I know this first hand as a private school trustee, parent and substitute teacher.  Teachers want to teach.  They are passionate about it when the materials are their own, when they can talk with collegues about the best ways to teach, to integrate curriculum, to reach a certain kid, and so on.  The passion dies when they are told that all 10th graders in California will cover pages 38-50 of Silas Marner on October 15.<br />Wagner's best point goes to organization.  State school superintendents and elected boards of education know more about politics than they do education.  Schools need to be small (400 kids or less), largely autonomous (set their own curriculum, choose their own materials), and supported by parents (free to choose which among several public schools best suits their children's needs).  Parents who have a say in the school will become involved.  Teachers who see the same kids over a period of years, and see maybe 40 instead of 150 different faces over the course of a day, will know more about those kids and be better able to help them.<br />Wagner cites a lot of evidence that smaller schools do not cost more than big ones.  Classes may be smaller, but the need for security, counseling and other types of specialists decreases when teachers and administrators know the kids personally.  As private school parents already know.<br />Good going, Tony. Speak with your own voice instead of borrowing those of other experts and I'd give you five stars.

She misses no opportunity to launch into George Bush (Sr. & Jr.), IBM and Lou Gerstner, conservative think tanks and all other likely targets.  The only unlikely target is Bill Clinton, who proved feckless standing up to the above.<br />Some of the many weaknesses in the book:<br />1) She does not address the reason standards were introduced in the first place.  Her denial that there is a problem with our schools is weak.  She makes no statistical defense of the teaching profession in general.<br />2) She argues almost entirely by anecdote.  She cites the fact that many able teachers find standardized tests a hindrance.  She does not propose an alternate means of evaluating teachers.  That seems to be the issue at hand.<br />3) She only examines some of the organizational weaknesses in public education.  The fact that they are subject to politics at the national and statehouse level, and that superintendents are often unwilling to stand up to political pressure.  She does not talk whatsoever about dealing with teachers' unions, getting rid of tenured incompetents and other problems that standards were introduced to address<br />This book is great if you have fire in your belly and are looking for anecdotes to feed your outrage.  Otherwise don't bother.	2002-08-12

The articles accuse much of the media, especially television news, of sloth, cowardice, careerism and cupidity in refusing to pursue very clear evidence when it appears likely to be damaging to government or corporate interests.<br />The centerpiece must be her story and that of fellow journalist David Hendrix about the evidence that TWA800 was brought down by a war-games missle gone amok rather than a fuel-tank explosion.  The chapter on the drug war by Michael Levine (The Great White Lie) is also compelling.  The material is so damning of the CIA and FBI that one has to wonder a) if they are true, why have these agencies not simply offed the authors?, or b) if they are false, why have they not been slapped silly with libel suits?  After all, they name names.<br />This is a very different book than Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\".  Bias merely states what many people find obvious: the NY Times, Washington Post, LA Times and Network News are dominated by big-city liberals with Ivy League pedigrees.  Borjesson damns them much more completely.  She finds them so contemptibly secure in their newsroom cliques, Narthas Vinyard and radiccio-BMW-granitecountertop lifestyles that they won't bestir themselves to undertake an investigation that involves, work, risk, or an examination of their belief in the sanctity of government.<br />I'll close with \\"privishing\\", a publisher's chickening out on a book and starving it by doing a minimal press run, no promotion and no second runs.  Claimed in one chapter to have happened to investigative books on the duPonts and Rockefellers, it sounds like what happened to Levine's \\"The Big White Lie,\\" a great book I stumbled on two years ago by accident and had never heard of before or since.<br />I'm a conservative, these authors definitely liberal, but we share an apprension of government unchecked and a complacent 4th estate.	2002-08-07

Note that this review is 4 years after publication... four years of silence.<br />A book that tears the mask off the fraudulent \\"War on Drugs\\".  It exposes the growth of the war from two (highly mutually destructive) agencies in 1971 (Customs and DEA) to 55 and counting.  It describes very extensive, high-volume CIA involvement in smuggling itself to obtain unaccountable funding.<br />It documents the cost of the fraudulent war.  In dollars misspent, in innocent lives lost through raids gone amok and witnesses silenced, in the credibility of government agencies and the news media, and in the harm resulting from the 5-fold increase (his figures) in drug usage during the time $1 trillion has been wasted in the fight.<br />Recommend finding this book used or in a library, or reading Levine's chapter in \\"Into the Buzzsaw\\" by Kristina Borjesson.	2002-08-07

His book operates at the levels of statistical methodology and analysis.  Method requires using the best available data, including both the data points that support and detract from the thesis, and plotting the data in every way that makes sense.<br />His premise is that most of the statistical analyses put forth by environmentalists support an activist agenda.  Support the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming.  Eliminate pesticides.  No frankenfoods.  Swap your SUV for a bicycle.  Dont eat meat.  Put a high tax on gasoline because we are running out of oil.  His observation is that advocates often tend to use sloppy statistics to support radical positions.  They incite fear that things are getting worse, whereas by almost any statistical measure life on earth is getting better in almost every way.<br />After presenting his methodology, Lomborg looks into the trends for world hunger, illness and mortality, pollution, depletion of natural resources and energy sources and global warming. Statistics in large measure disprove a number trends that we have been lead to fear: the increase in the incidence of cancer and infectious diseases, air and water pollution and the health risks associated with pesticides. Though statistics support other trends such as the hole in the ozone layer, extinctions, fossil fuel depletion and global warming, Lomborg finds that the extent of the problem, the projected direction and scale, and the threats are often terribly overblown.<br />Lomborg observes that statistics about the environment are inevitably politicized because they feed a political process.  What problems need to be addressed, how do we address them, and how much and whose money do we use to do it?  Above than that there is a question of whose values will be imposed on the society.  Will we outlaw frivolous consumption just because it wastes our resources?<br />A key conclusion, certainly not original with Lomborg, is the need to impose a calculus on the value of human life.  Because legislators act out of fear rather than fact, some environmental regulations cost $20 billion per life saved while others cost virtually nothing.  While savings lives is certainly good, the obvious conclusion is that far more lives would be bettered by choosing the cheaper options, and in fact more good might result from spending a sum like $20 billion on education rather than the environment.  Educated people live longer.<br />Lomborg would purport that his own agenda is to advance the understanding and use of scientific method.  His statistics demonstrate he is not in the pay of the tobacco or oil companies.  I think hes right, and would ask that a skeptical reader question the motivation of his detractors.>A key conclusion, certainly not original with Lomborg, is the need to impose a calculus on the value of human life.
