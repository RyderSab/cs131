US	44270199	R1VM3IYSHV3VP4	037303847X	75391845	Their Pregnancy Bombshell	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Pleasant Surprise	I really enjoyed this book, I sort of grabbed blindly from the romance rack at the library, none of the titles having grabbed my attention.  This is a story that is different in several ways from most of the Harlequins I have read.  Firstly Sara is several (it doesn't say exactly how many) years older than Matt, her eventual husband.  The book begins with her daughter driving off to her honeymoon.<br /><br />Sara has a few days to spare before she has to work again and winds up spending them with a total stranger that she instantly clicks with, Matt. And while I can't say it isn't sexual, at this point I am really impressed with the author's ability to attempt and build an authentic relationship between the two of them.  One that has to stand the trials of their imprompteu marriage that covers the other half of the book.<br /><br />Ultimately Sara is the better drawn of the two characters but Matt isn't entirely a cookie cutter, and the supporting characters are great, there is a real sense of community in this book.  I will have to hunt down the second book about Amber, Sara's daughter, and hopefully more about Matt and Sara is in that one.	2005-10-13

One of the most enjoyable romance novels I have read in a while.  I was genuinely interested in the growth of the heroine and the hero, too.  Most of the change that Chellie goes through is prior to the begining of the narrative, but its effects are felt for the first time within the time frame of the novel.  Ash, our blond former military hero grows from a man ready to judge a book by its cover to a very convincingly in love hero.  More so than most romance novel heros I really beleived him when he declared his love.  And the way  he does it really had me turning the pages for more.  The sexual tension is very beleivable, and I am glad that Chellie is a strong enough character to really stand up for herself, as is Ash who does not dissapoint me in the end.  A man confident enough in himself to let Chellie be herself.<br /><br />I was left with a very happy feeling at the end of this book  and I am ready to look for more books by this author, in hopes they are as enjoyable.	2005-10-12

I picked it up from the assortment that the Halloween display had to offer because I liked the artwork on the cover and the title caught me eye.  San Souci seems to specialize in Cinderella tales, this certainly is like none other that I have read.  Up until  mid way it is just a fun perversion of the story, she is still working hard and under appreciated, but then the fun twist happens (As one of the real reviews gave away the whole plot, I won't be spoiling anything).  Instead of her loosing a slipper as any normal, decent Cinderella would--this skeleton, near Tim Burton version, looses the bottom half of her leg.<br /><br />In some ways this seems to bring the actions of her step sisters and other Prince admirerers closer to the original Grimm story.  As they too start snapping off their legs.  The rhyming verse is light hearted and quick, this isn't a particularly scary book but younger children might not like it as much as the original. Though I think most grade school children would get a real kick out of it--I could see it very successfully being read aloud to a classroom full of children in halloween gear.<br /><br />I love the art in this book, it is both beautiful and ghostly. And yes, very reminicient of Tim Burton's claymation works.	2005-10-04

She creates her two main characters well, and isolates them from the real world.  The male narrator operates on his own terms, something which seems to defeat him a bit by the end.<br /><br />As far as a coming of age novel--this offers something new, but at the same time its the same old \\"I am so different from everyone else, I am going to difficult and whiney\\"  Finding a teenage audience for this book is not hard, most teens would agree with much of what the protagonist is saying and in that it has to be acknowledged that teens aren't that different from each other in that aloneness.<br /><br />The relationship that the boy and girl have is what is nice about this story.  I just have no love for the narrator, I found him stupid and self centered, without any reason for it.  You can be different and an outcast without such undeserved amounts of angst, that frankly frustrated me.	2005-09-27

Of course I procrastinated, but once I picked it up--right from the first page I was completely sucked into the story, everything that was going on was very clear in my mind's eye, each character quickly formed solid people to me.<br /><br />It is amazing, the book is huge but there is not one dry moment or an instant that released me from its spell long enough to make me want to stop. More often than not I simply fell asleep fighting, wanting to turn the page once again.<br /><br />The Cardinal is not the villian he is boiled down to in the theatrical versions, instead he often helps the Musketeers, the real villian in this book is Milady, an amazing character.  She is a woman who has learned how to manipulate the weaknesses perceived in women at this time, into enormous strengths.<br /><br />The relationship between D'Artagnan and Athos is especially poignent, an amazing feat considering how action packed and dialogue driven the book is.<br /><br />Having never read this book before, I didn't notice anything lack in this translation of it, the langauge flowed and there weren't any jarring problems.  I did miss having detailed footnotes a few times, just to explain a few references and allusions, but mostly it would have been to satisfy my own curiosity not any confusion in the narrative.<br /><br />It is clear to me now, why this book is a classic. I doubt many could write a book with the same little jabs of insight and attention grabbing action and humanity. It's amazing!	2005-09-27

An enjoyable adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, sort of in the vein of Clueless but without the sparkling wit.  It is very predictable, especially for anyone who is familiar with Jane Austen's original work.  Georgie is a nice addition to the story--though she could be traced to Margaret in Emma Thompson's adaption, same tomboy zeal for life.<br /><br />Some characters' motiviations aren't very clear to me either, such as Lucy--who is a bit more sterotypical than the original Lucy Steele. Standard nasty blond girl who somehow is the most popular.<br /><br />It also seems that the story contains a bit of an Emma plot line with Abby and her friend (who's name i can't remember--and I only read it yesterday) vying for the same drummer.<br /><br />All in all, it was aptly compared to a teen beach read.  The girls are cute, and the story is enjoyable in its fluffiness but not the timeless classic from which it has been clearly taken.	2005-09-01

The cover art is hilarous, in fact it really is my favorite thing about the book. The rest of the illustrations inside are black and white, look possibly to be charcoal sketchs so they don't have the same sharpness that the cover has.<br /><br />As for the text, some might prefer to read the explanitory notes that are in the back beore hand, if they aren't familiar with the world of Norse mythology.  Though it isn't necessary.  Everything is explained pretty well.  It is perhaps some of this need for explaination that slows down the narrative slightly, I didn't find the book as humourous as I had hoped I would.  I did most certainly giggle aloud on the discussion over what to make Thor's bossoms' out of.<br /><br />Thialfi as a narrator works well and is woven into the myth very seamlessly, an impressive feat and a credit to Coville's familiarity and admiration for the original stories.  All in all I found it very engaging and well thought out, but not the strong example of humour I felt it should have been.<br /><br />For similar books I reccomend Kate McMullan's Myth-o-Mania series.<br /><br />Hopefully Coville will find ways to make more Norse myths accessible to the younger audience, and the world at large.	2005-08-22

Ten pages later I was completely sucked into it.  (Mind you I did find it a bit lengthy when I was a bit more than half way done, but that was my obsessive reading habits coming out rather than any real tedium with the plot).<br /><br />Sage weaves a really great story, the world is so easy to see and understand.  She doesn't explain ad nauseum how the Heap's world is constructed, but slowly peice by peice it falls into place and her language makes is so easy to see in the mind's eye.  The chapter illustrations are fantastic too, I haven't seen better in a really long time. My only complaint with them is that images are reused, there is not a new image for each chapter heading.  I would have loved to see more of the brilliant illustrator's pencil drawings and I felt a bit cheated when there weren't new ones for each chapter, but once again the boggart or the same picture of Jenna.<br /><br />I do find it a bit odd that all Magyk words and phrases were in bold lettering, but that I suppose is a sort of trick for the younger readers.<br /><br />As for the story, even with its huge cast of characters and its great length and the time period it covers. Not only does it cover Jenna's life time but we see glimpses of a time before her birth when the Queen was still alive.  The characters are all really well drawn and I enjoyed them all, even the bad guys aren't really menacing sort of in the vein of Skeletor--a sort of glee in being bad. Of course this could change in later books--as there was no major show down between good and evil here.<br /><br />I did have one moment of being jarred out of the book's reality when Sage compared someone to 'an ancient egyptian mummy'.  It seemed to me, up to that point that she was creating a world without basis in our own (although certain things are clearly borrowed).<br /><br />Anyone who is looking for something between the Charlie Bone books and Harry Potter in the same vein, this is the book.  The next one can't come soon enough for me.<br /><br />The one thing this book has that many others in children's fantasy lack is a very strong sense of family. This was something I found refreshing and very enjoyable.  The Heaps are clearly very loving (though there are signs of an older surly malconent amongst the group), loud and large family.

Usually with Harlequins I devour them in a matter of hours. This one took me several days to finish.  For me, it was too dark. Hassan is a sheik who goes to an American oil company, in Texas. The company is owned by a man who is from a country which has been at odds with Hassan's.  It is suspected that the oil buisness is just a front for terrorist activites, and that is what Hassan is there to investigate.<br /><br />However, he did not plan on the CEO of the company  being the lovely daughter, Elena, of the owner. As he thought the CEO was male.  It is a clashing of old world and new world. And where Hassan actually stands in the end is a bit muddling.  He clearly understands both ways of thinking, but I never was entirely certain which direction he leaned towards more.  I did like how strong of a character Elena was--but the things in her life that happened, were just too horrible for me to really enjoy this book.<br /><br />It is so close to not being a romance novel, I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't something I had certain expectations for, which it fell short of.	2005-07-13

This book is more from the male's perspective--Dr. Jason Steel, Emma has more secrets for him and the reader to discover. Slowly it gets revealed that she was jilted by the badboy of the small town that Jason has moved to. Moved to in hopes of escaping the fast paced life he was leading with his fast paced fellow doctor girlfriend. Low and behold both former flames reappear and cause mayhem in the protagonists getting together.<br /><br />Of course all is happily resolved in the end. However, it is never clear why Jason has decided he needs a wife, and why specifically he wants Emma.  I was never entirely convinced of their real allure for each other.  I would also have liked to have seen Jason's doctor life---country wise play a greater role. Reaffirm the life left behind in more ways than the crummy exgirlfriend.	2005-07-13

This was the first Nora Roberts I have been able to read all the way through.  It was better than I thought it was going to be. Usually I can't take what she writes seriously. But this time I don't think she was taking it seriously, so it worked out well.<br /><br />Its the usual undercover royalty storyline. I don't quite understand how a princess, who is clearly very good at being a princess is able to turn into a domestic goddess. She cleans and cooks like an army of Martha Stewarts, it seems.<br /><br />And the little plot twist at the end is pretty silly, but I liked it, though clearly the male character was more than a little annoyed by it--as it is something that does not fit him or his family very well. It was a bit forced on Roberts part, a twist like that would have been better with a bit more foreshadowing.<br /><br />However, the relationship between the main characters  is pretty interesting. And it isn't a bad read.	2005-07-13

The two main characters, Charles and Lise share a love of history and are drawn together, on a personal level because of a family mystery.  It is the family mystery and how the various characters are dealing with it, it is just a bit of romance, not a dramatic death type mystery--that really spices up this book.<br /><br />Charles and Lise are really great characters, and one gets glimpses of the other characters that appear throughout this series.  It is also neat to seem them falling in love over a period of time that is greater than a few days, as is the case in so many of these books.  This romance, relatively speaking, takes its time blossoming.<br /><br />My only complaint is that we don't get to see the birth off the child in this book, and I am not sure if it occurs in one of the other books--but either way it is always more interesting to get the reaction of the parents from their pov and not the interepretation of another character.  There were clearly alot of loose ends by the end of this book, to be wrapped up later in the series. But ends that were pertinent to this books unique plot would have been better if delt with here.  It would have been nice to meet the dastasrdly ex-husband twin.  How did he end up so totally awful when his brother is a modicum of perfection?<br /><br />All in all though, a really enjoyable book.	2005-07-13

Which of course, is common in these books.  Elly Anderson is a geneologist doing work on a family tree (a royal family tree) which leads her to having to tie up a loose end.<br /><br />Daniel Eastwood is the loose end, a previously unknow illegitmate heir to the Elbian throne.  He is also, several months older than the reigning legitimate heir, something that causes a bit of a stirr.  It ends with the pair and her father being holed up in the royal palace of Elbia along with the half-brother king.<br /><br />To even the dramatic scales, Elly has a dark past. Her mother having died trying to have another baby. This and pressure from her father have forced her into deciding never to have any natural children.<br /><br />With the insta-attraction it is hard for Dan's desire for a family and some roots and Elly's aversion to having a family to find a happy middle ground. This is the real dramatic tension of the book--remarkably, the royal ancestory is more of a setting than actual tension.<br /><br />Its a pretty enjoyable book. By the end of it, one is pretty convinced how much these two characters (despite the insta-attraction) care for each other.  The supporting characters are pretty amusing too, but don't play as major a role as I might have enjoyed.	2005-07-13

Very few characters that actually distinguished themselves from the crowd. The narrator's arch nemisis--who seems to be rather inspired by  Susan Lucci is the only completely fleshed out character, any character who has scenes with her is automaticlly more interesting.  Without her the book is entirely vapid and as she is an entirely vapid and vindictive character that isn't saying much.<br /><br />This book was entirely too long for what it was, there was no character growth or any impending moment to keep me reading it just sort of kept happening, without the interest of a huge funeral or wedding that a soap would use as a crutch to draw attention from it's audience.<br /><br />(spoiler)<br /><br />The very best part about this book--which was actually a very insipred comic moment was Kate's house burning down because of the home-made 'christmas angel'.<br /><br />I think maybe what made me really against this book was this character's ability to almost do exactly what happened to her to another woman. (Who's friendship isn't very clearly establish)  It should have been a more triumphant book end both for the character and for her faith in relationships between women and their men.	2005-07-05

My sister read it before I had a chance to and she summed it up pretty well. It is a mediocre book that manages to make itself memorable only through the character gaining independence on the very last page.  The reader is left hanging but satisfied as to her fate.<br /><br />Its actually a remarkable choice for the story and narration considering the lackluster of the rest of the book.<br /><br />This book falls into the category of dissatisfied/slightly lost female trying to find way in life.  No one in this book displays any real integrity which is why I probably didn't like it.	2005-07-05

That rare coming of age story, about girls--this book is very well written.  Each character is very uniquely its on self and well drawn out.  The pants aren't so much the importance as the sisterhood is.<br /><br />My personal favorite girl to read about was Tibby, her character had the strongest sense of growth in this book and probably the most emotional ride.  Of course none of the other girls avoid an emotional moment.  This book does not fall under the light read category as it does deal with real issues, death, remarriage, sex, etc. Things that real girls deal with, and they are dealt with in a real way. The girls being overwhelmed and frightened, as fifteen year olds are.<br /><br />The book picks up enough by the end to make one want to read on in the next book.  A great book for any girl in middle school or older.	2005-06-10

I can't help but think of this series as Harry Potter for younger readers.  It does have certain qualities that the Potter-world lacks.  While there are horrible examples of adults, there are several more examples of parents and adults really trying to take an active role in their children's lives.  And while Charlie Bone is the title character he isn't the epicenter of these books' universe, there is more more team playing going on.<br /><br />In this book, several new characters are introduced but only explained in the breifest of detail. I would have loved for more background information on Alice Angel and Billy Raven's guardian.  Billy is a key player once again, and a new ally is gained through Ezekial's botched black magic. Probably one of the best twists in the series.<br /><br />A very quick read, but well worth it. I think these books are just so enjoyable.	2005-06-09

I read it after I saw 'Finding Neverland', a good movie, but this book is far far far better.  It captures the real essence of Barrie, with letters from him, to him, about him and excepts from his works as his life unfolds.<br /><br />Not only is this book fabulously informative it also flows remarkably well for being so chock full of information.  The narrative voice is very unabtrusive and is kept to a minimum letting the first person sources speak for themselves.  The photographs are enchanting and really help one see how Barrie envisioned his own Neverland.<br /><br />It seems to capture how Barrie was an odd combination of innocent and adult.<br /><br />I would have loved to seen more on his life beyond the Davies, but that was not this book's purpose.  I do think however, a summary as to the fates of the Davies boys at the end would have been in keeping with the narrative as the book does touch upon not only the effect they had on him, but the effect he had on them.  Some of which seems to have been resented by the boys.<br /><br />This book serves as a great doorway into both Barrie's life and works.  As anything read after this can be framed in the narrative of his life.	2005-06-02

I didn't even realise it was a self help book until several days later when I caught the smaller print on the back. Oops.<br /><br />Considering the list of accomplishments the back of the book gives the author credit for, I was expecting it to be more humourus.  However, I didn't really laugh past the first page. Though--the book clearly wasn't meant to be really funny.<br /><br />As far as being a self help book goes (not that I have read many, on purpose or accidently) it seemed like after the initial novelty of man in armor as metaphor for keeping oneself sheltered from the world it is pretty trite and cheesy.  I don't know how useful it would really be, anyone that emotionally stunted would probably view this book as a waste of their time.<br /><br />As for using the Arthurian lore, it is probably a good use of Merlin. Though the presence of the king (not Arthur) seems problematic, he along with Juliet and Christopher should hve been mentioned at the end.  Afterall what is the point of this journey of self discovery if it isn't proven that it did make a difference?	2005-06-01

However, it was pretty undistinguished as far as romance novels go. I liked the begining with the girl and the young man before they became adults.  Piper however, is a bit hard to beleive, never into girly things, but as soon as she tries she masters it, but still a tom-boy.  I think she is a little bit too much of everything. Gabe on the other hand is pretty interesting, and I liked his insecurity in his physical apperance, it was really rather refreshing to see a guy worry.

Then he is captivated by a woman playing in the water.<br /><br />Kit Romaine is a young woman on the island at the insistance of her older sister, who is having marital problems.  Kit herself is a boatload of problems,with lots of past problems that she tends to blow way out of proportion, due to her sensative nature.  Inspite of the unbeleivability of her past and reaction to it she is a pretty endearing heroine and goes well with Phillip.  The book does a good job of putting magic into love. And that is certainly very worth reading.	2005-04-16

Of course that she gives up her buisness life by the end sort of defeats that.  I was kind of dissapointed in Izzy in that she didn't seem tohave any of the backbone that was needed to reach her position in the buisness world.  And it seemed really melodramatic to have the wife who had caused Izzy and Will to be her best friend...and die conveniently.<br /><br />There just seemed to be a lack of something in this book, the characters weren't entirely alive. Though I did like alot of the supporting characters, Will's mother and Izzy's assitant for example.  I also thought that there was a nice side plot developing with her in the buisness world that got cut abruptly instead of tying into the romantic plot.	2005-04-16

As always it was super engaging, and Mia is always a very beleivable first person narrator.  I was surprised by the preoccupation with \\"the Big It\\" that this novel focused on, afterall Mia is only 15.  But I was glad at her still maintaing her stance on waiting until she was comfortable.  I loved Tina's advice on the subject, and them referring to it as the gift of the flower of their virginity.  It might bave been about \\"It\\" but it was a very good handling of it, and not the glossing over that I often see in similar books.<br /><br />I adore Michael still, though I do think that sometimes Cabot glosses over too much of what is said between him and Mia compared to the minute detail we get in other aspects of Mia's life.<br /><br />There are clearly issues that this book establishes and leaves hanging for future novels.  But a satisfying read, but NOTHING like Disney made Mia (I love when Mia mentions those movies that were made about her)	2005-04-16

It is completely mind blowing to read these actual (though slightly adapted) Sumerian poems that are so...sensual and nearing explicitness.  I would have liked to have seen more on Inanna's context in the Sumerian pantheon and her role in society.  Also  more on some of the art in the book would have been great, though seeing all of the pictures of these clay seals and such was great.<br /><br />A very interesting book, though if you are looking for some Sumarian equivalent to Bullfinch's Greek myths this is not it at all.<br /><br />I think I need to know more about Sumerian mythology and society in general to really appreciate this book, though. It is not really a good starting point.	2005-04-02

The present, the past for the characters and the past of the people in the photograph.  It begins with Claire and her estranged husband, Joshua digging up a photograph of people who look exactly like them, but from over a century ago.  It's mystery forces them together, something they haven't done in over 5 years, since the death of their son. As the three time lines intermingle the hero and the heroine grow closer again, in ways that their younger selves were unable to due to immaturity and situations.<br /><br />All in all it is very enjoyable and has two great supporting characters in Sarge and Wilma.  The ending is a bit dissapointing as I had hoped for an explaination for the photo, instead it sort of mysteriously changes into people who look nothing like our reunited couple	2005-04-01

I didn't find Calum's confession of love beleivable either, possibly because there was nothing from his point of view and nothing from Dot's to indicate that at all.  Never mind how quickly Dot's prim and properness flew out the window.  I rather wished that the friend she had been with in the first chapter had made more of an appearance to round her out a bit more, as the supporting characters were dominated by those of his world.<br /><br />I did enjoy the epilogue however, by that time Dot and Calum seemed to have ironed out their relationship to one I would have enjoyed reading more about.	2005-04-01

Near child virgin bride coerced into marriage/buisness merger to appease her ailing grandfather--to 13 years her senior very experienced man with a permanent mistress.  Nena was an enjoyable character, her innocence and her strength of character were well portrayed, I just didn't like Ramon that much.  His mother admits he has had his way too much, and Nena attempting to tell him that just ends in him being more convinced that he must always take the lead in everything.<br /><br />Its a quick read and isn't out and out throw across the room disguisting/disturbing. But the more I think about the age and expereince gap between these two the more I am disturbed by their union.  It just didn't sit right with me.	2005-04-01

The characters both had their mysterious past wounds that needed healing, through lots and lots of sex. Of course, this leads to them finding true love with each other.  There was very little conversation between the hero and heroine that wasn't an out right fight (both between each other and internally between mind and over powering hormones)<br /><br />It was very quick paced, and inspite of its super crazy plot (500 million??) didn't make it impossible for me to read, but I doubt I will remember it in a week.	2005-04-01

This was a Harlequin I doubt I will forget for a while, mainly because it had so many elements that are not typical fare in these books.  It begins with the hero being forced by the heroine to rescue her (nothing too new there).  However, he is the one that is blushing at every turn, and she is the one who has a successful buisness career and a lifestyle that needs slowing down.  It was great to see a woman in the lead like this.<br /><br />Hugh is good looking but scruffy, extremly happy in his own skin and with a lot more depth than his lazy demeanor implies, the author does a wonderful job of conveying this.  With the example of the chess game coming to mind.<br /><br />Of course he is good looking and good with the women, but he has a sweetness to him that is very unusual and endearing in a hero for these books.  It was great!<br /><br />Syd is a bit of a paragon, pretty, intelligent, nice, occasionaly spontenious, but she does it in a way that isn't irritating and is very full of humility.  I also liked that she was escaping the usual plot device 'buisness merger/marriage' (which is often seen in these books) and creating a whole new plot.  The two characters also compliment each other nicely, they fit and not just in insta-hormonal ways, they seem to bring out better elements in each other.  Also, Belle the dog and the local people were a very nice touch.	2005-04-01

Although, the viewed seemed, in the end to be pretty similar to the other books 'Vanessa the pretty popular one, Catty the artsy one, Serena the smart talented one, Jimena the tough one' And now introducing, Tianna, the sporty one. Sort of the like some Spice Girls/Sailor Moon hybrid.<br /><br />Even with her amnesia etc, it doesn't explain to me why Tianna changes which guy she likes with and without her memories.  And how does she have powers if she is not a a Daughter of the Moon to begin with, but gets adopted into the fold?<br /><br />My nitpicking aside, she was a strong character, and her confusion was much easier to follow than that which Serena experience in book 2 (I think that' the right number)<br /><br />One of the better in the series overall, but the ending was a tad too cheesy.	2005-03-31

It also marks the return of my favorite character, Stanton.  Inspite of the forced relationship between him and Serena, he and Vanessa still have a very strong bond it seems.  He protects her--for Serena's sake, of course. But when he interacts with Vanessa, the chemistry is stronger than when she is with Michael, or he is with Serena.<br /><br />The Daughters of the Moon have to fight a new kind of bad guy in this book, a demon.  And one who used to be Maggie's lover, we learn alot of little secrets about Maggie in this book.  One of which seems like it should have greater reprecussions than it is having (Spoiler:  Her deal with the Atrox.)  I am still frustrated by Maggie, she always seems to be with holding information, and it never works for the girls benefit.<br /><br />Vanessa also has a secret talent, that gets revealed, making her even more of a paragon of perfection.<br /><br />Also who exactly are these daughters of Pandora? And why do they  have to be horrible--after all Pandora is an Eve like figure, so wouldn't her daughters just be all those regular girls walking around?  Pandora wasn't a goddess....	2005-03-31

I just finished reading this fabulous book, completely unexpectedly, as I had no idea a new one was on the way. Very pleasant surprise to say the least.  As usual the characters in this are fantastic!!  We don't get as much from some of my favorites, like Foaly and Butler as we have in previous books, but they are still very strong presences.  Colfer does a great job of telling one moment in time from various view points so the reader is always in the know (as much as anyone can be in regards to a criminal mastermind like Artemis Fowl, that is)<br /><br />(Spoiler warning)<br /><br />It does sadly have a character death, though it was handled very well.  Artemis' thoughts and insights are great, and he and Holly share their special chemistry even with him not having his memories for most of the book.  The last little blip in the book, an 'article' seems to promise alot more from my favorite 'reformed' child-mastermind, and the next book will be taking the characters in very different directions, it seems, than they have been traveling in the previous books. Not just the reformed Artemis, but Holly as well--and in some degree together.<br /><br />Awesome read!!	2005-03-31

I wanted to get to the book that I knew would be focused on Stanton and his point of view.  It wasn't as fufilling as I had hoped, however, it was not as dissapointing as the book told from Serena's P.O.V.  What is great about this book of this series as all of the background information we are getting, Stanton's past, that of some of his fellow followers and more of the technicalities of following the Atrox.  The book also does a nice job of leaving you wondering what is going to happen next. It doesn't necessarily leave you with a burning desire to find out what happened next, but a mild curiousity that could lead to me reading it, or not.<br /><br />And I still don't get the attraction between him and Serena. I almost want him to hook up with Cassandra, she seems more interesting in many ways.	2005-03-19

(I am currently reading the 5th book) Ewing's portrayl of Catty is the most realistic and fully realised.  She even comes across well in the other books, her character is always well defined and unconfused.  This book also focuses a little more on the technicalities of being a moon goddess than any of the others and sounds far less hokey in doing so.  Stanton has a nice featuring role, which is good, because he is the strongest character in the whole series (the most interesting too, that bad boy that needs to be redeemed is always appealing).  It is also nice to see a glimpse of another generation of Moon Goddesses and how someone else could be as frustrated with Maggie as I am.  I hope this is a sign the rest of the series is picking up in quality.	2005-03-06

You can tell that this is a woman trying to write a character that is very very far from her own life experience. Jimena's use of slang is forced and unnatural sounding.  I don't really sympathize with her.  It might have helped if we had had a flashback to the night of Veto's murder.<br /><br />Ewing is not good at making use of her supporting characters in these novels, focusing soley on the character whose point of view we are getting. So then, it seems that those who aren't in focuse act out of character (ie Vanessa getting another boyfriend besides Michael...sure)<br /><br />Maggie is still an annoyingly alusive/all-knowing character.	2005-03-03

Hopefully this will still hold true with the other books. However, I found this book very blah.  Serena was a character I was unable to get a firm understanding of--perhaps due to her mental confusion in the book, it made her less sympathetic than a heroine should be though.  And being a fan of the character Stanton, I really don't understand his draw to her.  There is some character trait that she has that needs to be delved into, as to why he would like her better than Vanessa (who he did have chemistry with) and why she would be so susceptible to the dark forces.  Not just her super power.  I did like her brother Collin and Wally the raccoon, however Morgan is a character that is very flat and deserves better treatment.	2005-02-26

This book, each short story sucked me in and had me rushing home to read more.  I loved it. Even the Devil's Pool, which I found a bit awkward with the dialogue (something Sand herself addresses, and can be attributed to translation to a degree) was still a great story, I loved its follow up even more, \\"The Country Wedding.\\"  \\"The Unknown God\\" was a great story as well, very timely in my studies too as I am currently reading abt the time in history it is relevant to (the Christianization of the Roman Empire).  I loved \\"Lavinia\\"  it had a sort of Bronte feel to it as far as the setting goes but with a more Jane Austen like prose, more wit than melodrama.  Her letters are my favorite, I would have to say, without charcters as her mouthpeices George Sand is amazing. She spits out one witty remark after another, filled with insight and passion.  I am blown away. I highly reccomend this book as a great introduction to her works.	2005-02-26

It definately is aware of current trends. I was very pleased with the Greek/Roman mythology that it uses for its basis. And when the book is focusing on the main character and the drama of a teenage girl dealing with problems it is very entertaining and enjoyable. However when the book takes on a broader scope--the character \\"Maggie\\" being the  most problematic for me, it looses my interest and I became very aware that I was reading a very campy book.  It works best when the characters are just accepting that they have powers and don't try to explain them, once the book trys to go into the reasoning of the powers it really looses me and I find it very silly. However, if I have time I will most likely pick up the second book because I did find it enjoyable brain candy and not completely drivel.	2005-02-24

This was the first book in the series (Royally Jacked, etc) that I have been able to get past page two on.  Possibly because I have a love of mythology myself and I enjoy seeing what other people will do with it in their own work.  The main character is very blah--she is sort of a more dedicated nerd version of Princess Mia  (From the Princess Diaries).  The gods that are in this are very clearly undeserving of being immortal and the point is made that they really do belong as old relics in a nursing home.  It is predictable at the end.  It did satisfy me in that one couple that Cupid puts together (the least likely one) stays together. However, issues that it raises for the characters--Laura's newly lovey dovey parents, Cupid's parental baggage, why Mercury cares for the humans more than anyone, why the ambrosia and nectar seems to be not doing its job and keeping the gods young anymore--these are things that are unanswered, and the presence of an epilogue could have helped greatly with a majority of them.  I also felt that the resulting pair that Laura was made a part of was forced, I was cheering for her to embrace her singleness. Because maybe the 'moral' shouldn't have been that we don't need the Roman gods to get us to love anymore, but that we should concentrate on ourselves before we even try to involve anyone else in our lives in that way. After all it was made clear that most teens in relationships in this book were far from happy.	2005-02-18

It took me a good way through it to figure out that it was actually a version of a much older fairy tale--which greatly impressed me.  Ella is completely herself and both unable and unwilling to depend upon such things as magic, ulitmately, to rescue herself.  This is a fantastic book for young girls (and young boys if they are willing)  but it certainly illustrates the power of one determined young girl.	2005-01-18

I could imagine it a great way to help teach kids map skills. It is 6 maps of fairy tale lands, each map has a set of directions to find a treasure at the end.  The format of the book is a bit problematic as the illustrations are rather small, making the directions harder to follow and the spine creates a problem when measuring distances on the map, as it is right in the middle of said maps.  All in all a very neat idea.	2005-01-12

Cabot is completely consistent in her style,so if you enjoyed the first few books of this series this one is a certain win. Obviously these books aren't for everyone, you have to have a certain amount of self-humour in order to connect with Mia and see the humour of the situations she is involved in.<br /><br /> I'd also so these books aren't necessarily for some of the youngest readers as she does talk about 'getting to second base' quit a bit.<br /><br />It is good to see the effect Mia is having on those closest to her in this book, most noteably her Grandmere, and finally Lilly has to admit she was wrong about something!!	2005-01-12

I enjoy it when the heroine does not have to compromise who she is to get the man in the end, in this book, Sophie, a journalist for a popular magazine (think like People) remains herself until the end.<br /><br />The hero needs a little more than tall dark and handsome. Fabien--has only a little more, he is french, titled and tortured. So we get the added random French catch phrases, the brooding looks and scars from a past accident.<br /><br />The past is key for this as Sophie is trying to figure out a pivotal moment in Fabien's past. Westwood does a good job of pulling the past into the present narrative.  What she also does exceedingly well is introducing and maintaining constant tension between the two characters. There are also a nice array of supporting characters (mostly cultivated from Fabien's side of the story, and a few aren't entirely explained as well as I would have liked it). This also has a nice PG-13 rating.	2004-12-18

I was curious about her after watching the movie \\"Impromptu\\". It was a bit of a quest to get my hands on one of her books--possibly this would not have been my first choice. Either way, I found it very interesting.<br /><br />It is hard to grasp the revolutionary nature of some of the ideas she has in this book--i.e. equality of women from a modern view point. Of course much of what she is saying and observing is still quite relevant in many ways. And she has a marvelous way of saying what she does. It makes me wish I could read French well enough to read it in the original.<br /><br />It was a great example of first person narrative, and Horace certainly is a character unlike any other I have encountered in a book.
