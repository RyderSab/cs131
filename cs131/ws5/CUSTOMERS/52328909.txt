I finished is only because I hate not finishing a book.<br /><br />Shawna (Shawn) MacDonaill is found, naked, laying in a ditch near a road in Northern Virginia after disappearing 7 months before in Texas. FBI \\"Director\\" (I am guessing they mean \\"Assistant Director\\") Jerico (Rico) Chamaune has made a hobby of studying and investigating cases of missing women, including Shawna's.<br /><br />The FBI and local law enforcement search the area, trying to find the kidnapper and any other victims he still has (plus the remains of past victims). Meanwhile, Rico and Shawn fall in love.<br /><br />The editing is horrible. Poor punctuation and wrong verb tenses make this book very hard to read.<br /><br />Rico and Shawna are not well-fleshed out characters. By the end, we know as much about the seconardy characters are we do about the primary ones.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only if you wanted something mindless, but with pretty good sex scenes.	2005-09-04

If I could give it a 3.5, I would.<br /><br />The idea behind this book is a good one and the general plot is well done. But there is too much extra stuff (the adopted kids and the endless accounts of repairs are just two).<br /><br />I kept reading because I wanted to finish the book, but I don't know if I will want to ever reread this one.<br /><br />If you like historical romance and can stand long, flowery passages, you will probably enjoy this book. If you like more straight-forward writing, don't bother.	2005-06-25

Sadly, it didn't deliver. From any other author, I would say the book is amazing. But knowing what Radclyffe can do, this book left a little to be desired.<br /><br />So much more could have been done with Arienne's career. (Although I understand if the author didn't want to make a political statement.) Also, Mrs. Whitley's romance seemed a little forced, almost like Radclyffe wrote it as an afterthought and didn't know what to do with it.<br /><br />Overall, this book is worth reading and owning. Just be prepared.	2004-10-27

However, the book falls on it's face due to a poor writing style. The characters are there, but you never get the feeling of being there with them.<br />A bit of knowledge of The Inferno helps to read the book. (I put the book down to reread The Inferno.

The personal and professional struggles they go through are well-written and touching.<br />That said, the interaction between Dez and Jay was rather hackneyed. It almost felt like Lake wrote the story, then realized she needed to have some sex scenes, so threw them in as an afterthought. (It got to the point that as soon as Jay and Dez went to bed, I skipped until they got out of bed.)<br />I also didn't like how Sara, Tim, and Kevin disappeared from this book. They played a major role in \\"Gun Shy,\\" then became cardboard walk-ons in this book.	2004-04-21

The authors make several claims that require the reader to be willing to say &quot;I believe&quot; in order to agree with the points they make. However, if the reader is willing to take theory and let it be elevated to the level of possible truth, this is a good book.<br />The points made, while they fit together well, still leave a lot of doubt. (Yes, they could be true, or it could be several people reading a lot into nothing.)<br />A working knowledge of early European history is a bonus while reading this book. (I don't have one and had to do a lot of side reasearch to figure out who and what the authors are talking about.)<br />Read this book, but remember it is only a theory.

However, the editing was HORRIBLE! (In one case, the doctor tells Catherine to look at a body's right arm, then starts talking about the bruising on the left arm.)

Also, everything was just wrapped up with almost no effort from the main characters.

I was so disappointed with it, though. The book deals more with the occult and less with the case. The idea of Frank and Mother fighting lifetime after lifetime is about as cheesy as it gets. (I will defend myself by saying that I enjoy science fiction and fantasy books. Just not in the middle of a mystery.)<br />On the other hand, I enjoyed the development of Frank and Gail's relationship.	2004-01-07

While there were some mistakes, they did not detract from the plot as a while. Anyone who is used to reading mysteries knows there is always a twist.

This book returns to the high level of the first. The characters are very well written and the interplay is realistic.<br />  The only complaint I have is the use of Spanish at the beginning.

In so many cases, she throws the idea out there and then leaves it. Angela is said to be a lesbian, but that never affects her or her life. The nun is a Net-porn fan, but that issue never comes into play.<br />A decent read if you all you want is an escapist book. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf	2003-10-31

The whole idea of the radical pro-life killer was good enough without having to bring back someone from Kerry's past.

So imagine my disappointment with this one.<br />The characters are horribly cardboard. It is almost like the author took every sterotypical crisis, threw them into a pot, and pulled out this book. Plus, the story jumps around so much that you can't get a good feel for any of the characters.<br />Although Liz's job at the radio station does lead to her meeting Kate, all the other scenes concerning her job could be deleted because they do nothing to advance the plot. (It almost feels like the author included them in order to have some conflict.)<br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br />While Chris's illness is central to the story, even that seems forced. She's sick, she gets better, she dies. Her death, although intended to be the climax of the book, is almost glossed over. (Though granted, that could just be because the reader knows Chris is going to die.)<br />**END SPOILER ALERT**<br />Even the love story is convoluted. The relationship with Liz and Kate is never really developed. Liz spends most of the book sleeping with and claiming to be in love with Kate, but keeps pining over Chris.<br />Unless you have a lot of free time and a high tolerance for cheesiness, skip this book.	2003-10-16

The main characters just aren't likeable. Bree is horribly immature. Her one love is her music and when that is gone, she is nothing. Jorie is too scared and confused to know what she wants. (Although I agree with another reviewer - I liked Diane and Pam.)<br />Kallmaker spends too much of the book centering on the negative that even the reader becomes depressed.<br />I will buy Kallmaker's next book.

The questions and confusion. Then all of a sudden, they have sex and the book turns into a collection of erotica. Lane and Diana just run from one sex scene to another with very little interaction with each other or the other characters. I enjoyed the scenes where they are talking, getting to know each other. However, those were few and far between.<br />The other characters were interchangeable and very cardboard. (I kept mixing up Millie and Madge.) Diana's relationship with Jack is not explained until the end of the book. The confusion Diana \\"suffers\\" is rather mild compared to a real coming-out.<br />Overall, the book was a decent read. However, it does not live up to it's billing as the greatest lesbian romance ever.	2003-08-19

Radclyffe does a very good job with their meeting, developing friendship, and eventually love.<br />However, Jessie and Kate almost live in a vacuum. Although there are other characters, only Mae plays any kind of real role in the book. Everyone else seems to be written in just to take up space. Kate's parents don't even put up much of a fight when she tells them she wants to move in with Jessie. (Sure, they fight her, but suddenly she gets sick and they change their minds.)<br />As a love story, this book is tops. As a story overall, it needs beefed up.	2003-08-19

However, once Jaime and her fiancee break up and Jaime begins to come out, the writing and the story become very cliched.

I have loved all of Cornwell's fiction and believed this would be in the same style, even though it is non-fiction. Wrong! I have 2 major complaints about this book.<br />First, as other reviewers have said, she seems to have made her decision as to who the Ripper was and then pulls together evidence that supports her claim. She talks repeatedly about how little evidence there was and how hard it was to find much of it. Since it was so hard to find what she does have, how much evidence did she not find - evidence that could clear Stickart's name? When writing fiction, the author needs to first determine the solution and work backwards, building evidence for that ending. Real life doesn't work that way.<br />Second, the writing does not flow well. She bounces from subject to subject with little or no break. Many times I found myself flipping back through the pages, trying to find when she changed thoughts and to what.<br />All in all, this is an interesting study into the Jack the Ripper case. However, I feel Cornwell has gone too far in saying she has, hands down, solved the mystery	2002-12-23

But once the action started picking up, it moved a lot faster. It isn't too hard to figure out who the killer is just by process of elimination.

However, I agree with the earlier reviewer who said she thinks Reilley wrote a long story and then split it up. I had thought this book dealt with the beginning of Kate and Becky's relationship. And in a way it does, if you just think of the beginning as &quot;how they met.&quot; However, Becky is barely in this book - no more than any other character except Kate. This book is reported to be a romance, but there is no romance in it. Kate and Becky barely talk! It also seems things work out too well; the highjackers give up too easily. There is no suspense.<br />All in all, the book is a good lead-in, but not a good book on its own.	2002-10-15

However, the mystery itself did not flow well. It seemed to me that Brett and Allie got most of their clues by luck and by Brett's contact with the dead Liza. I think the best approach to this book is to just tell yourself &quot;I believe,&quot; and force all doubts and questions out of your mind. I also saw no reason for Storm to keep appearing. Until Storm's appearance, Brett seemed to have no problem with her memories of Storm. It was only after Storm appeared, and told Brett she had to let Storm go, that Brett started questioning her relationship with Allie.	2002-10-06

It was too good for just 3, but 4 is pushing it a little. The book started off really well and for the most part, stayed that way. However, there were too many scenes where Lex and Amanda start flirting and teasing each other for no good reason. You could say it is the joy of a new relationship, but it happened too often. It got very old, very fast. Eventually, I just started skipping over those scenes and started reading again when the plot started back up. If you can tolerate the &quot;puppy love,&quot; then the book is for you. If you want a plot that flows with no sudden breaks, I would recommend you pass on this one.	2002-10-02

I have been listening to &quot;West Virginia, redneck, inbred, hillbilly&quot; jokes since I moved to Virginia 8 years ago. I was very happy to find that the author treated us with respect.<br />My knowledge of the Thirty Years War is very limited. For that reason, I felt the historical events were a little hard to follow. However, the 2 maps at the beginning of the book were quite helpful.<br />I also feel there were a few too many characters in the book. There were many occasions when I found myself flipping back, trying to remember who someone was. I also feel the author could have done more with the Simpsons. He would bring them up, but then let the topic drop and go on to something else. (Maybe they play a larger role in the next book.)<br />On the overall, however, this is a wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next one.	2002-08-13

I was surprised by the number of different approaches the authors took. (I was expecting a lot of re-told fairy tales...)	2002-05-01
