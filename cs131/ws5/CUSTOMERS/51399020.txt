It has two main problems.  The first problem is that it's very difficult to locate relevant information--the index is very poorly constructed, and even obvious and common tasks can be hard to track down.  For example, I needed to know how to make a data point on a dot plot be hollow.  This isn't an unusual task, and it's quite easy, *once you know how.*  Good luck finding out how from this book, though.<br />The second problem is that the information provided is often quite sketchy--an unexpected feature in a book that is over 1000 pages long.  In the worst case, I found that for a whole class of features that I needed documentation on (Excel's built-in statistical tests), it actually referred me to Excel's help feature.  Obviously, if that were adequate, I wouldn't have bought the book!<br />The fact that this book hasn't caused me any actual damage saves it from a one-star review; however, if you need either a tutorial or a comprehensive reference on Excel 2000, this is not the book for you.	2004-03-25

I've had it for over 11 years, and still use it regularly.<br />An unusual feature of this cookbook is that it explains the principles that give cuisines of different areas their distinctive flavors.  The idea is that you can categorize cuisines in terms of (1) their primary ingredients, (2) the cooking techniques that are used, and (3) the types and combinations of flavorings that are added.  (Somewhere along the line the author must have studied structural anthropology.)  A later section of the book talks about how to combine these elements creatively.<br />One thing about this cookbook that must be mentioned is that the recipes work.  I can't recall ever making something from this book that didn't turn out.  The directions are very clear.<br />There's a lot of great stuff in here; I'll mention just a few stand-outs:<br />- mu shu whatever<br />- ful gobi (cauliflower curry)<br />- Provencal bean and sausage soup<br />- vegetables Provencal au gratin<br />- Spanish codfish soup<br />- Italian meatballs	2003-02-19

However, there's also some treatment of the history of linguistics, starting with the historical linguists of the 19th century.<br />This is an incredibly readable book--lively and well-written, so much so that for a week I skipped my lunchtime novel and read this, instead.<br />I found two more or less separate threads in the book.  One is an insightful treatment of pre-Chomskyan linguistics, with a chapter each on 19th-century historical linguistics, Saussure, the American descriptivists, and (primarily) European functionalists.  The second thread has to do with Chomskyan and other approaches to linguistics as of the late 70's/early 80's.  Some parts of this second thread are as screamingly funny as the elements of the first thread are insightful; I don't think that &quot;funny&quot; is normally a word that you would associate with a critique of classical generative grammar, but indeed I was rolling as I read it.  To be clear--I mean &quot;funny&quot; not in the sense of being laughable, but rather humorous--it's really quite entertaining.  His analysis of the sins of rationalism as applied to questions in language acquisition is absolutely devastating.  Hopefully Sampson's description of the Chomskyan community is no longer accurate; I can't recall ever meeting a linguist as stupid as he paints (at least the early) TGists as being, and sometimes wasn't sure that his description of their theoretical excesses was not meant to be hyperbole or a caricature.  In any case, it's tremendously enjoyable to read.  And, Sampson certainly does point out both the things that TG is good for, and the weak points of the theories that he *does* approve of.<br />All in all, a great book--I'd love to see an updated version.	2003-02-18

The words &quot;online applications&quot; in the title suggest that this book is about NLP for websites, but it's much more general than that; certainly any of the technologies discussed in it could in fact be implemented on a website, but &quot;online applications&quot; should be interpreted as meaning something like &quot;applications that are made possible or commercially viable by the availability of large bodies of documents over the Internet.&quot;<br />The focus of the book is on technologies with commercial applications, and that aspect of the topics discussed in the book is addressed clearly and well.  However, there's also plenty in the book that will be of interest to a researcher, especially one looking for an overview of a topic.  In fact, the book reads much like a series of well-written review articles.<br />The first chapter of the book discusses some of the general issues and challenges in natural language processing, on a level<br />that should be accessible to pretty much anyone.  (Actually, one of the really outstanding features of this book is its overall readability.)  Subsequent chapters focus on information retrieval, information extraction, and text categorization.  The final chapter has shorter sections on other topics, including summarization and named entity recognition.<br />All chapters of the book are characterized by high readability, clear explanations of algorithms (and I say that as someone who struggles with ANY algorithm), and good explanations of the relevant evaluation metrics.<br />This book would be a good starting point for anyone; if you're not a beginner in natural language processing, you'll still find much that's useful in this book.	2003-01-31

However, this book just does not cut the mustard.  The class overviews that make up the bulk of the book never seem to have quite enough information or quite the right information, and the overview material in the early chapters isn't that great, either.  Again, it's an issue of just not presenting useful information.  Case in point: the discussion of &quot;static&quot; gets a total of three short paragraphs which bring up almost none of the important points about this keyword.  Yet, almost two pages are devoted to recursion, which is certainly an important topic in computer science but isn't exactly the sort of thing that you're likely to be looking for when you go to a reference book on Java.  If you're looking for a good general reference on Java, try David Flanagan's &quot;Java In A Nutshell,&quot; instead.	2003-01-17

Books	5	16	18	N	N	Best book I know of for learning Perl	This really is the best book I know of for learning Perl, and I say that as someone who owns a very large pile of books on the subject.  I first bought it when I started a year of full-time Perl programming, and it was the book that let me get up and running.  Some years later, I *still* go back to it occasionally--there are some things that it just explains better than other books do.  (In particular, it does a good job with some of the occasional dark corners of dereferencing arrays in complex data structures.  If you know what that means: there's some weird syntax to this that this book gives very clear examples of.  If you don't know what that means: trust me when I say that this book will tell you how to handle it without requiring that you completely understand why it's hard first, and that's a VERY good thing.)<br />If you're already an experienced programmer, you'll do fine reading the introductory material in Larry Wall et al.'s &quot;Programming Perl,&quot; but whether you're an old hat at hacking or not, you'll get plenty out of this book.  When you're up to speed, your next book should probably be &quot;Programming Perl&quot; or Nigel Chapman's &quot;Perl: The Programmer's Companion.&quot;	2002-12-01

It has an especially good chapter on metrics for evaluating the progress of your testing effort--the metrics are easy to calculate, and VERY importantly, easy to understand by--and convincing to, in my experience--the people you'll be reporting your progress to.  There's also a good chapter on bug-tracking, and some discussion of how to write bug reports that I've found very useful for training new testers.  Plus, there's lots of useful perspective on general management issues--hiring; the interdepartmental issues that (as far as I know) are unique to testing; etc.<br />I wrote this review based on the first edition--a second edition has since come out.	2002-12-01

This is a very handy book.  It's arranged by road name and by stretch of road--if you find yourself on, say, I-70 westbound from Denver, go to the table of contents and you'll quickly find something like &quot;I-70, Denver to Dillon Reservoir.&quot;  Go to that section and you'll find a small map, geological diagrams, and probably a photograph.  There's also an introductory chapter that gives an overview of Colorado geology and geological history, as well as very clear explanations of geological terms.<br />Driving on Colorado highways you see some pretty amazing rock formations, and visitors to the state are always asking about them.  This book will tell them (and you) anything you might want to know, and explain it clearly.  I keep my copy in the car, and consult it often.	2002-12-01

The book provides a view into a type of company and an approach to software development that is different from anyplace *I've* ever worked.  Many things about it have stuck with me--the perspective on testing an operating system that will have to work with every popular software product; the staffing philosophy at Microsoft; the &quot;eating your own dog food&quot; concept (developers and testers had to actually use NT as they were developing it, thus constantly exposing themselves to its flaws).  The author does a good job of telling the stories both of the big players and the worker drones.  It's a very personal book about what strikes me as a very impersonal company.  It's one of those rare non-technical books that I recommend to people who are new to software engineering.  I read it for the first time when I'd just gotten my first software development job, and again several years later, and I didn't enjoy it any less the second time around.	2002-11-13

It isn't. Rather, it's a book about things going wrong with software. The author tells readable stories about some infamous software bugs, at least one of which I've never been able to forget. This is the story of the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, which caused deaths and injuries due to a software problem. Some of these stories have morals which software professionals would do well to keep in mind--and not just developers, but the people who give them their marching orders. For instance, the Therac-25 story makes clear in a very sobering way how an apparently VERY minor change to a program can have VERY unanticipated consequences. The A320 story makes a convincing case for thinking hard about user interface design.<br />Other parts of the book talk about why building good software can be so hard, and about some of the people and organizations that work towards developing approaches to issues in software quality and construction. You wouldn't think that these would be particularly interesting subjects, but for the most part the author makes them come alive.<br />This is not a technical book--don't expect to come away from it with any new debugging techniques. Rather, expect it to give you lots of food for thought.	2002-11-13

This book isn't necessarily accessible to the complete beginner--the intended audience is advanced computer science students, computational linguists/natural language processing people, and library/information science students--but if you fall into one of those categories, you should find this a very readable book.  The coverage of topics is heavily slanted towards practical applications--editting and formatting, compression, encryption, file access, information retrieval, indexing, abstracting, spell checking, syntax and style checking--rather than towards theoretical background.  That's not a bad thing, though--for many of those topics, this might be the most accessible resource you'll find.<br />The book was published in the late 80's, and hence is a bit dated by now--for instance, the statistical revolution in NLP pretty much isn't covered (Bayes doesn't even show up in the index).  However, that in no way detracts from the value of what IS covered.	2002-11-04

The entries are complete, giving multiple senses of the world, describing idiomatic constructions, distinguishing between figurative uses, domain-specific senses, etc., and sometimes giving synonyms, as well as the prepositions that go with particular verbs.<br />One of the best things about this dictionary is that it sometimes includes sentence-length examples.<br />This dictionary's one weakness (for non-European users, at any rate) is its bias towards British English and Iberian Spanish, at the cost of Latin American Spanish and American English.	2002-08-08

A few months ago I compared several English grammars side-by-side, and this was one of the top two, the other being Quirk et al.'s far more [costly]work.

I've found the functional descriptions to be especially helpful.	2002-05-13

The coverage seems adequate. I looked up ten randomly-selected words that are pretty specific to my own area of expertise (invasive cardiovascular technology), and found five of them listed, two of them either partially listed or with their component terms or some similar term listed, and only three (\\"stent,\\" \\"Wenckebach,\\" and \\"Swann-Ganz\\") not listed (possibly because the dictionary doesn't list proper nouns, as it turns out). The coverage of general medical terms and anatomical terms seems pretty good.<br />A couple of nice things about this dictionary:<br />1) When there are both colloquial and \\"official technical\\" translations for an English word, both Hebrew terms are given. (It would be even nicer if the second edition indicated which is which.)<br />2) It is well organized, with related terms grouped together. For instance, in the English-to-Hebrew section, under \\"presentation\\" you will also find \\"breech presentation,\\" \\"face presentation,\\" and \\"vertex presentation,\\" while under \\"tachycardia\\" you will also find \\"atrial tachycardia\\" and \\"ventricular tachycardia.\\"<br />One smallish caveat: the Hebrew is not vocalized, and there are no pronunciations given for the English, so this dictionary might be more useful for people who need to interpret written texts than for people who need to express themselves orally.<br />A suggestion for the second edition: list abbreviations and acronyms!	2002-05-01

I am particularly impressed by the author's pointing out of the frequent differences between \\"standard textbook\\" Hebrew and colloquial Hebrew as spoken by the man in the street--if you already have some command of the language from formal study and want to make your Hebrew less \\"schoolboy\\" and more colloquial, this book will help a lot in that respect.<br />The example sentences in this book, as in Prof. Glinert's longer grammar of Modern Hebrew, deserve special mention, but as they are frequently mentioned in other reviews, I won't belabor the point.	2002-04-13

Some things that make it so great:<br />1) Huge numbers of usage examples, at a wide range of levels of<br />formality.  The examples give information that's lacking in most dictionaries, such as which preposition(s) to use with a given verb.  They also contain a wealth of idiomatic constructions.  I'm amazed at how much time I've spent just browsing through the examples in this book.<br />2) Excellent differentiation between multiple meanings of a word.  If there are multiple Hebrew words that correspond to a given English word, they are very clearly differentiated, often with examples that further clarify when to use which (see above).<br />3) The vocabulary covered is VERY comprehensive and covers all ranges of style, from literary to colloquial (including, I was happy to discover, many obscenities).<br />This dictionary also is not necessarily for beginners.  Some reasons that it's not necessarily for beginners:<br />1) It's English-to-Hebrew only; if you're looking for a very first dictionary, you might do better with a bilingual one.<br />2) It doesn't list the gender of nouns, nor does it list irregular plurals.  (Gender and plurals can generally be figured out, if you know the rules, but it's nice to have them made explicit.)<br />Since this dictionary is published by Oxford, the English is overwhelmingly British.  This is most obvious in the fact that many British idiomatic expressions are included, while American ones seem less well-represented...	2002-04-13

It's an excellent introduction, and well worth reading. No algorithms, but a great overview of the issues and problems in MT.	2001-08-26

With the author's combined backgrounds in journalism and anthropology, it's hard to see how he could have gone wrong.  Add to that a good eye for picking an interesting subject, and you've got a winner.	2001-07-31

All of the relevant features of the phonology of the language are covered.  Contrasts in sounds that are difficult for Europeans to hear and/or produce are exemplified very clearly, and there is opportunity to practice hearing them in context as well as in isolation.  This cassette/book set couldn't possibly be any better.	2001-07-18

It's very well written, and data-rich.  Every historical linguist and sociolinguist should read it.	2001-06-25
US	51399020	REOFSYKKEBDLT	0715621629	879234650	The Grammar Of The Yiddish Language	Books	5	19	19	N	N	Excellent reference text	This is an excellent reference text for anyone interested in the Yiddish language.  Some strong points: (1) It's full of realistic example sentences, some favorites of mine being &quot;dvora ken im nisht fartrogn in zi vet nisht geyn&quot; 'Dvora can't stand him and she won't go,'&quot;du bist b'mekhile an idyot&quot; 'do forgive me for saying so, but you're an idiot,' and... well, there's a lot of them. (2) Discussion of dialect geography (3) Full paradigms (4) Explicit indication throughout the text of words that are pronounced differently than the standard spelling indicates (5) Very well-written discussion of many interesting issues in Yiddish usage and semantics.<br />One shortcoming of this book is that it was published at a time when it wasn't as easy to mix English and non-English fonts as it is now; apparently the publishers coped with this difficulty by printing its originals directly from a Mac, with the result that the typeface doesn't always read very easily.  A solution to this would be to reprint it with modern composing and printing facilities.  It's a good and very valuable book, and deserves this extra effort from the publisher.	2001-06-08

I've carried it on many hikes, dog walks, and through several years of walking to graduate school.  It's easy to use, detailed enough to be helpful, and small enough (my aged copy, at any rate) to fit in your back pocket.  Of all of the field guides that I own, I've used this one the most.	2001-06-08

It talks about the anatomy and physiology of speech, place and manner of articulation (without ever mentioning those, or any other, technical terms), and discusses why children learning language don't get all sounds right immediately.  If you're a linguist, speech therapist, or anything similar, and you have kids, you REALLY want this book.	2001-06-08

Now I'm using it to teach my child.  Can't give a better recommendation than that!	2001-06-08
US	51399020	R3GNJ2F2R7LHR9	0812212495	496835048	Languages and Their Status	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Excellent	Along with the other volume in the series, &quot;Languages and their speakers,&quot; this is one of the top 10 books on linguistics.  The book consists of a set of articles/chapters on various languages.  For each language, it walks the reader through an analysis of some grammatical aspect of that language, and it also talks about the social environment of that language and its speakers.  For instance, in the chapter on Mohawk, it walks you through an analysis of polysynthetic morphology.  (If you're not a linguist: that's a way of forming words that seems very exotic if your native language is English.)  It also talks about the near-death of the Mohawk language in Canada, and how an effective language maintenance program was instituted for Mohawk there.<br />The book is very, very readable.  I've often used chapters from it as extra-credit assignments in introductory linguistics courses, and I've read it for fun more than once myself.	2001-06-05

Some of its strong points:<br />* Good coverage both of the arguments for standard Chomskyan theory, and the experimental evidence that fails to support it * Excellent coverage of child language acquisition * Explanations of important experiments--how they worked, what they showed, and why they mean what they mean<br />I've used this book successfully in 3 introductory psycholinguistics courses, and have sent a chapter from it to my grandmother to explain what linguistics is.  Can't get more accessible than that!  At the same time, though, it's useful for anyone who wants to get a handle on the field; it's where I go when I want a refresher.	2001-06-04

US	51399020	R3S1FCREYUP8PQ	0195072561	147005010	The Linguistics Wars	Books	5	28	29	N	N	One of the best books about linguistics ever written	This really is one of the best books about linguistics ever written--maybe the best. As a linguist, it brought me to a whole new level of insight about my field. I wish I'd read it before I ever started graduate school, instead of afterwards--every graduate student should read this before taking their first syntax course.  I managed to make it through six years of graduate school without ever understanding why people found syntax and semantics interesting; this book helped me to understand why they did.  That's not really the best thing about this book, though; the best thing about it is the story that it tells about an exciting and turbulent time in the scientific field that's more interesting (to me, at any rate) than any other.	2000-07-06
