The story moves at a prety fast pace, which is good, and if you can get by some of the more outrageous parts of the book (the marraige of the main characters, for instance).  But unlike \\"We Were The Mulvaneys\\", this one never seems to catch fire.  I think it's because the characters aren't really that likeable; I never really cared what would happen to them.  And the last third, where the children are grown, has no heart.  Overall, while interesting, it certainly wasn't a page-turner.	2004-11-02

I was hoping for a little more than that, since I regularly read his columns, and there wasn't really anything new.  The author covers a wide range of topics, from why a plane flies to the best airport terminals.  It's obvious that the author loves flying, and that is reflected in this book.  A good read, but probably not much new to reader's of his column.	2004-10-15

The style and subject matter bring to mind an early Tom Clancy, but without all the unnecessary political grandstanding.  And at 400 pages, it's a much quicker read.  This is an excellent, fast-paced, and timely thriller.  There are constant twists throughout the novel, and not just one climax at the end, which makes it a more entertaining read.  This is the first book by this author that I have read, but I'll be picking up some of his earlier work.  This isn't great \\"literature\\", but it's perfect for the beach or on a long plane ride.	2004-09-14

The good points:  it moves along fairly quickly; it has a unique insight into Chinese culture; and the author's writing style is unique (as compared to contemporary American authors).  The bad points:  there is very little character development and then mystery solution is bland, at best - the climax leaves the reader unsatisfied.	2004-08-06

I picked it up because I had read two good reviews of it, but I feel differently.  I have a lot of issues with this:  one, I didn't feel anything for the characters - there wasn't much development at all; two, the plot was thin - a page-turner this is not; and three, the novel had a distinctive English feel to it (meaning it's a little boring).  Maybe I would have felt differently if I had read some of the other 'Frank Elder' novels, but I haven't, and I don't.  And except for the last 50 predictable pages, there's not much action here, either.	2004-08-03

It's a page turner that more than held my interest.  Lots of good twists and turns will keep your attention.

I was not disappointed.  I was a little weary of the whole murder-mystery in Thailand angle, but it turned out to be excellent.  The author sprinkles little factoid about Thai society throughout the book; they are interesting, educational, and never overwhelm the story.  There are lots of twists and turns, which you would expect in a mystery, but they are never trite or far-fetched.  I tore through this book very quickly - it's an excellent summer read.	2003-07-15

And while I find a lot of the WSJ recommendations good, I had to disagree with this one.  Although the author has come up with a great plot, the telling of it leaves something to be desired, at least as a summer read is concerned.  The author does well slowing revealing the pasts of the central characters - the characters are all intertwined in ways that they know and don't, and the setting of Ireland and a transatlantic boat trip are unusual ones.  But this wasn't an easy book to read, with the author trying to go for an authentic mid-1800 tone.  The language was difficult to digest while sitting by the pool in the hot sun.  In a nutshell:  story good, ease of readability bad.  Bangkok 8 is a much better summer read.	2003-07-07

It certainly spans a lot of time, a lot of lives, and a lot of stories.  And it does so very well.  Set in India through the middle half of the 20th century, it describes an environment of corruption, poverty, and fatalism that was enlightening.  The characters in this novel, for the most part, are resigned to their course in life and are passive in terms of affecting change.  The novel aims for sweeping grandeur, and achieves it.  This are wrapped up a little too tidily in the end, but this is definitely a worthy read.	2003-06-18

It's fast-paced, interesting, a real page-turner.  At some point though, about half of the way through, it starts becoming a little too predictable.  You know the hero is going to stumble, and he does, but not badly; there is too little conflict here.  There needs to be a lot more drama here.  The hero is never in any danger, except financially, and who really cares about that?  The pharmaceutical industry is also too easy a target to demonize; we already know that it's not exactly the most moral of industries, and Grisham never presents the good about the industry to balance the bad.  There is too little character development, and the girlfriend/fianc character is cookie-cutter at best.  Maybe a good beach read, but don't expect too much.	2003-05-28

This is the fourth novel of Ms. Shreve's that I've read, and while it's entertaining, it's nowhere near the level of \\"Wife\\".  It's a period novel, and has a novel approach in that the author tries to write like she was from that time.  It's a little off-putting at first, but ends up okay, if a little gimmicky.  The story line could be straight from a soap opera - tears and affairs and strong-willed women, and the requisite happy ending, of course, but the novel rising a little bit above that... though not that much above.	2003-05-22

It would seem to be smallpox, but the author spends an inordinate amount of time on the anthrax letters following 9/11, for no seeming purpose other than to re-hash the events in dramatic form.  The book also jumps too much from topic to topic, seems to implicate one person in particular for the anthrax mailings, and doesn't really have any conclusions.  The book is a narrative of on-going events - the anthrax case is open and smallpox is still around in freezers around the world.  There is no closure at the end of this book - it leads the reader nowhere.	2003-05-13

They're funny in an offbeat and skewed way, and are easy to breeze through.  Once Mr. Sedaris starts talking about his hitchhiking travels, the comedy subsides quite a bit.  His last essay, Naked, was hard to get through; he tries to end with a triumphant message, but it falls flat.  If you've heard him on PBS or seen The Santaland Diaries, you'll like this.	2002-01-04

Because Armistad Maupin actually loves his gay characters; they aren't ashamed of their sexuality, nor do they apologize for it.  He has a light and breezy style, with a lot of dialog.  You could easily read this on a long, rainy afternoon.  Published well over 20 years ago, I'm sure most gays will still see those all to familiar scenes (the bar posing, sex, drugs, that little silver dish with multicolored soap balls over the toilet...) that proves the old adage, the more things change, the more they stay the same.	2000-12-12

Maupin has the same style - light, with a lot of dialog, and plenty of odd and interesting plot turns, as in the first novel.  I would recommend not reading them in succession, though.  You need to read someone else to kind of clear your palette.   He has the same characters and the continuity is a good thing, but I could do without the nicknames (Babycakes and Mouse).	2000-12-12

The struggle and turmoil he dealt with are chronicled ably.  His style is to jump back and forth between past events and current feelings, like the omniscient narrator in a movie would; it is an effective way to comment upon occurrences and enlighten the reader.  He also has a take-no-prisoners style of writing (notably on what gay life is like) that may be a little disconcerting to some readers.  And on occasion I was impatient with all those pre-gay details and wanted to know what happened after he came out, but the book is really the story of what happened to him before he came out.  Overall, a poignant and satisfying read.	2000-12-12

Ms. McDermid does a good job telling the story within the story - it's very good, if a little short on plot twists.  Any longtime McDermid reader, like me, will recognize her style: efficient and concise.  The larger story is also good, and I couldn't wait to get to the end.  That said, the climax does fall a little short.  It wasn't quite the shock it was supposed to be, at least for me; maybe in Britain this is scandalous stuff; but in this time and day in the U.S., it's nothing we haven't seen before.	2000-11-27

The book runs along in 3rd gear most of the time, never really reaching a dramatic climax, which is really not good for a mystery, and the pretense is a little hard to believe:  intrepid reporter for London tabloid gets everyone's help in solving murder mystery, even help from those who shouldn't be helping her.

It's not too heavy on character development, but just enough to keep the characters interesting without an Oprah-esque heaviness.  It's got a couple of different mysteries running at one time, but the writer handles that with ease.  There was one section (a chase through Europe) that was a bit long, but other than that, this is a very good, very quick read.  It's similar in style and tone to Patricia Cornwell's early work.  And beware that it's a British book, so there are a few phrases that might be a bit difficult to understand at first.	2000-10-21

A long rehash of what we've seen before - foreign country underestimates U.S., war starts, U.S. crushes foe.  Yada, yada, yada.  Some things ring very hollow:  I don't think I need to see the two most senior people in the CIA calling each other honey-bunny; the same goes for Jack Ryan and his 'babe' comments to his wife.  He rants, even more then usual, on Social Security, &quot;tree-huggers&quot;, gays, and women (his Secret Service agent Andrea Price-O'Day).  At 1024 pages, there is way too much character development and not enough action.  Finally, the whole reason for the conflict - the death of a couple of foreign diplomats, *they're not American, Tom*, is quite a stretch.	2000-10-09

Good writing, although some of the events in the novel are just plain harsh  and will make even the most jaded cringe.  The novel is well researched,  and should definitely hold your attention.  I particularly liked the  explanation of binding - what it is, how it's done, why it's done.  That  said, the only thing that I really didn't like was the end, it seemed flat  and a little contrived.  And the dysfunctional relationship may seem a bit  too convenient, but you have to have some conflict in a novel, and most of  the conflict here is character driven.	2000-08-23

This is the type of book that one might expect to see onOprah's book club: young girl warms the heart of two older bachelor brothers; high school teacher and colleague fall in love; small town where there are no secrets.  But is has some serious problems, the most serious of which is that the character's actions do not really make sense. ...  The reasons behind the character's decisions are not believable, especially when dealing with the bachelors.  These characters are creating their own chaos, and to be plausible, the reader needs to buy into their reasoning.  But there is too little conflict, too little soul-searching.  The drama seems manufactured and banal, and that is really the most important part of a novel like this.  END	2000-08-21

I'm tempted to use the word  boring when describing this, but I feel that might be a bit too harsh.   It's more of a textbook - it should be read over a long period of time.   What I find troubling is his thesis that homophobia has only exploded in  the past 100 years or so, but then he spends 80 percent of the book talking  about homosexuality from ancient Greece through the 1800s.  It's more like  a history of homosexuality with a dash of homophobia thrown in.	2000-08-21

It's a very short 230 pages, and can be read in  a couple of hours; it has a very light tone, almost flippant in the  handling of the main character's affair.  Serious subject, light tone -  they don't often go well together, and they don't here.  There are issues  that are brought up (religion, for instance) that are not explored to the  depth they deserve.  The author is British, and those unfamiliar with  English culture will surely be confused at certain social references (for  example, the subject of the parish jumble is mentioned several times).   Also, the author has an annoying way of starting chapters with dialogue  that is not attributed to specific characters, forcing the reader to  backtrack once a character is identified to find who said what.  Perhaps  I'm too used to the gravity of the Oprah line of novels, because I didn't  like the fact that I didn't take anything away from this.	2000-08-16

It's much more an admiring picture of his life than about the day he died.  The author repeatedly stresses the same themes:  he shouldn't have been flying, but didn't know  better; Jackie, Caroline, and he weren't too involved with the wild and  crazy Kennedy clan, but were very close to each other;  his ex-girlfriends  were all still friendly with him, etc.  He paints John's immediate family  warmly, but is still rather dishy; one has to wonder how accurate his facts  are.  I expected the book to be more in the vein of Into Thin Air or A  Perfect Storm, and in the end, I would also have to say I wouldn't have  wanted to read about the more salacious details of his life, they do  detract a great deal from his memory.	2000-07-31
