I figured that since I loved Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, a similar novel by George would have to be at least as good. Maybe I just had my hopes up too high for this one. It was still decent, but I couldn't help but feel that Interview just had it outclassed on so many levels.<br />My main problem with this book, was the same problem I had with Dying of the Light... the pacing. It was just very slow. Maybe I'm just a shallow reader who needs more action in his literature. The Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tuf Voyaging, Armageddon Rag, and almost all of his short stories were simply outstanding, so I'm having a little trouble putting my finger on any other reasons why I didn't like this book.<br />However, as you can tell by its rating, it certainly has it's fans here, so I'll end off just by saying that if you didn't care for Dying of the Light, you probably won't care for this one either, and visa versa. Its out of print in the US, so just get it from the library if you must read it, then buy it only if you liked it.	2004-02-08

Murdered and Deified A.D. 54 (Vintage International)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	What a great surprise!	***One of the TWO best books I read in 2003***<br /><br />My favorite author, George R. R. Martin, recommended this book on his website, so I grabbed the audiobook off the shelf at the library. It, in turn, grabbed my attention right away. It was excellent! I've never found myself making up so many excuses to go driving!<br /><br />I can tell that Martin was inspired by this book. Tyrion, one of his most famous characters from A GAME OF THRONES (an amazing fantasy novel), most certainly was based in part on Claudius, for they are rather similar.<br /><br />Of course, it also helped that I am a huge fan of the Roman Empire: Historical fiction novels, History Channel, Roman History classes in college, or whatever I can get my eyes and ears on. So I guess this book was simply up my alley, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone with similar interests.<br /><br />-Next in the series is Claudius the God, and I plan on reading it soon.<br /><br />-Also, if you consider yourself a true fan of this book, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on a copy of the 1975 Masterpiece Theater Miniseries of I CLAUDIUS, produced by the BBC. You might think its a little corny or outdated, but you should definitely give it a try. I found it at the library, and tore through all 7 tapes recklessly, and ended up quite entertained. Go for it!	2004-02-08

For a long time now, I've had a feeling that caffeine was not so good for you. I've been reading Men's Health magazine, regularly, and every issue seems to have two or three blurbs about why coffee is either bad or good for you. It seems like every study comes up with new evidence for one case or the another. Contradiction after contradiction.<br /><br />So, I was dying for a good book to give me some facts. I saw this one in the library, and scooped it up. I tried to be open-minded and skeptical at the same time, as I usually do when I read one-sided books like this, but I really became alarmed as I turned more pages. What Cherniske has to say really rings true, so I followed his advice and gave up the bean, and as he promised, I felt MUCH better once my withdrawal pains eased off. The biggest improvements were in my energy level, and the quality of sleep. I felt fully alert and ready to go as soon as I woke up every morning- without a single cup!<br />The most compelling statement he makes is that it will take about eight weeks of no caffeine to truly feel the benefits of its absence. Then he asks, \\"What do you have to lose?\\" If after two months of no coffee you don't feel a lot better, go back to drinking it for all we care. However, you'll be amazed at how hard it is to quit caffeine for two months. After two or three days, you will get some really hairy headaches unless you wean yourself off it slowly. And just try to walk by a coffee shop or the flavored coffee display in the grocery store without getting the shakes as soon as that old familiar aroma hits you.<br />Anyway, if you try to quit, you'll have no doubt that this is one powerful drug, and when you get those headaches, you can feel how bad it must be for your body.<br />-The only problem I have with this book, is that it was published in 1998, and there is no updated version, or newer books on the subject, and even Cherniske's website hasn't been updated in ages. Meanwhile, I still see plenty of new pro-coffee research articles in health magazines and such, and I *still* get the cravings every now and then, and I have to wonder how bad could one cup be now and then, or every two days or so? My will power is beginning to buckle here, and I could use some positive reinforcement despite the benefits I've felt. The pressure is pretty strong!<br />How about it Steve? We need you to refute these new claims!hile, I still see plenty of new pro-coffee research articles in health magazines and such, and I *still* get the cravings every now and then, and I have to wonder how bad could one cup be now and then, or every two days or so?

I will read the next one, but did anyone else get the feeling that Hobb really doesn't like her characters? She really beats the heck out of them... Mainly Althea and Wintrow. Wintrow was shaping up to be my favorite character in this big door-stopper of a novel, but as time goes on, the poor kid just gets his face rubbed in the doo-doo over and over again. By the end of the novel, I was ready to beg Hobb to just put the poor guy out of his misery. He needs an adult!<br />As I write this, I can't help but recall how she did the same thing to poor Fitz-Chivalry in Farseer. I don't think it grated on my nerves as badly then, but I have to wonder if Hobb is some kind of literary sadist. I mean, we get the point- Your characters are real survivors!<br />Well anyway... I am dying to read the Tawny Man series, soon, but I am determined to finish (or officially give up on) the Liveship Traders series first. So, Mad Ship will be the test of where I go.	2004-02-08

(I haven't read the two prequels yet, however) The Foundation Series' setting and Asimov's style just seems to be right up my alley. I've thoroughly enjoyed every Asimov story I've read so far!<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the original trilogy, was how Asimov told us a tale from one generation, and then he skipped ahead to tell us another tale from the next generation. Its a complete novella or short story for each Psycho-historical crisis, and then on to the next. Now in Foundation and Earth, as in Foundation's Edge, we are presented with a straight forward novel-styled book. This didn't quite grab me as much as the original trilogy did, but as I've said, I simply enjoy the Foundation setting. It was still enough to keep me turning pages anxious to see what happened next.<br /><br />I have no clue why this book is out-of-print. Did the publishers dislike it? Did they just not like the direction it took the series? Did they want F&E's ending out of the way to make room for the new direction in the newer Foundation books written by the \\"Killer B's,\\" which were written after Asimov's death? I didn't read those books yet either, and since they didn't get such hot reviews, I may not read them ever. Oh well.<br /><br />If the low average rating here on Amazon has you wary, you can always try to get it from a library. No need to waste your money on a potentially bad book. But if you enjoyed books 1 through 4, I'd say go ahead and give it a go!	2004-02-08
US	52240388	R2OOIWJHNIURCM	0441182003	554659900	Taltos	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Light and Enjoyable Series	This is one of those series that are far from perfect, but are really fun and quick to read. Brust has become a favorite author of mine because of his entertaining plot style, and Vlad has become a favorite character because of his entertaining methods.<br /><br />What really helped in drawing me into this series is the way that Brust jumps around in the timeline of Vlad's life... The second book takes place before the first book, and third book takes place after books one, two and four etc... Much in the style of Pulp Fiction, Brust jumps back and forth in time, fleshing out these interesting stories that were only hinted at previously, leaving us with plenty of mysteries, and no clue where we will be taken to next. If he had told the whole story in chronological order, it probably would have been much less interesting.<br /><br />My one problem with Vlad's character is that he is too much like a human-Swiss-army-knife. He is an assassin. He is a detective. He is a thief. He is a mob captain. He knows witchcraft. He knows sorcery. He is a master knife-thrower. He is an ace with a rapier. Perhaps its just my nit-picking nature showing through, but its a bit much to swallow even for a fantasy novel. Still, you'll probably find that Brust holds all this mud together quite well!<br /><br />Taltos, is book four in the Vlad Taltos Series, and it was thankfully much better than the third book, which was a bit of a dud. I recommend reading Jhereg, then Yendi, and then this book. Its a good ride!	2004-02-08

A year ago, I read Sharon Kay Penman's Here Be Dragons, and thought it was outstanding, and said as much in my review. I was anticipating that Falls The Shadow would be the next of her books I would read, but then I got an email from her publisher, thanking me for the great review- Would I consider reviewing this, her new book, if they sent me a free reviewing copy? Given how much I loved the last book, I was MORE than happy to accept.<br />So there you have it... this review may be a little biased. However, had I not liked the book, I'd not have ended up reviewing it. And while I don't quite feel that this is a five-star book, I cannot deny that it was a very enjoyable read!<br /><br />All the other reviews describe what the book is about, so I will just speak my mind instead...<br />It was mentioned that this novel might be more enjoyable if you had read the two previous \\"Queen's Man\\" novels first. While I can see how that could certainly be true, in my opinion, it stood on its own quite well. A few exceptions might be the Claudine/Justin relationship, and the few cameo appearances from characters who must have been friends/helpers of Justin in the first two tales. These threads served little purpose here, and held no meaning for the readers just joining, but were little more than a few speed bumps on an otherwise smooth road.<br /><br />As far as other mystery novels go, I don't recall having read any, but I feel that it was Penman's wonderfully detailed historical setting which really drew me in. I've never been to Wales, but having read Here Be Dragons, this was a more than welcome return to this rich, beautiful land. Prince Llewelyn of Wales, and Prince John of England, I now hold as two of my favorite \\"literary\\" characters, thanks to that book, and here we are given a very enjoyable glimpse of what their first brush with one another might have been like. -A speculative foundation for what would become one of history's most fascinating rivalries!<br />But what impressed me most about Dragon's Lair, was the pacing, which was perhaps not as smooth in Here Be Dragons. While there wasn't nearly as much action as in my usual reading fare, the plot involves you quickly and thickens at a nice steady gait, until we are given a very satisfying conclusion- which often makes or breaks a mystery. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the main culprit's identity might be obvious to anyone who's read her previous Welsh tales, or was familiar with this story's background, but alas, is that not a major obstacle of any historical fiction?<br /><br />All in all, this was a very solid book, which would have left me with great satisfaction even if I'd had to actually buy it!impressed me most about Dragon's Lair, was the pacing, which was perhaps not as smooth in Here Be Dragons.

I found this book of short stories nice and cheap. Its author line-up boasted such names as: Alfred Bester, Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight, Daniel Keyes, Walter M. Miller Jr., James Tiptree Jr., Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Isaac Asimov, Phillip K. Dick, Thomas M. Disch and a few I'd never heard of. Other than Asimov, I hadn't read any of these authors before, but had heard much about them. I decided this sounded like a solid intro to their writings- not to mention a \\"cream of the crop\\" selection from one of the most respected magazines in Fantasy & Sci-Fi.<br /><br />Among the contents were listed three short stories I'd heard of:<br />1. Daniel Keyes' FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON. In this story, we read the journal of a mentally challenged man named Charley, as he takes part in a monumental scientific experiment that will not only make his brain function normally, but advance him far into the realms of super-intelligence. But perhaps this gift is not as glamorous as it sounds...  I'd read the full novel-version of this story in high school, and it didn't really leave an impression on me back then. So I didn't really care that the shorter version was here. Thankfully I read it- for it was easily the best contribution in the book, and the only one I would rate 5 stars. I even want to reread the full novel sometime soon.<br /><br />2. Walter M. Miller's A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ is revered as a classic in the genre. I own the novel on my \\"to be read\\" shelf, and figured it would be nice to read this, the original short story version, first. It is our future after a nuclear holocaust. The world has been plunged into ignorance, but religion still exists and tries to make understanding of life and what was \\"before\\". This story was not to my taste at all, due mostly to the heavy religion I suppose. I fear I won't enjoy the full novel any better. 2 Stars.<br /><br />3. WE CAN REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE, by Phillip K. Dick, is of course, the short story that became TOTAL RECALL- One of my favorite movies when I was younger! It was interesting to compare it to the film, since they are quite different, and I think others would enjoy doing the same thing. I'll leave the details for your own discovery, but I will say that you probably wouldn't picture Arnold as the protagonist in THIS story! 4 Stars.<br /><br />There were four other notable tales in this collection:<br /><br />1. NOT WITH A BANG, by Damon Knight, tells a short post-apocalyptic tale of the last man and woman on Earth. He realizes that they are humankind's last hope, but she is a Catholic woman who refuses to have premarital sex with him, and there is no one alive who can perform the ceremony. -This was a clever idea, which I would have preferred as the basis for a longer story instead of an abrupt, short one. 4 Stars, none-the-less.<br /><br />2. Shirley Jackson gives us ONE ORDINARY DAY, WITH PEANUTS. Here is a day in the life, of an odd man, in an over-crowded city. What makes him odd? He is unbelievably nice! There has to be a catch right? -This was an enjoyable little story, with a nice ending. 4 Stars.<br /><br />3. Richard Matheson contributes the three-page story, BORN OF MAN AND WOMAN, which is told by a child... whose parents keep him locked up in the basement for some reason. -Very short, but very powerful. 4 Stars.<br /><br />4. My final pick is PROBLEMS OF CREATIVENESS, by Thomas M. Disch. This story tells of a future where the government controls the population by only letting it's most gifted citizens marry or have children. Birdie Ludd didn't make the cut, and now he is willing to try anything to change that verdict. -This story was rather fascinating, and really made this future seem possible and frightening. 4 Stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, I was fairly let down by the other \\"big name\\" authors in this book. One particular problem I had with this \\"retrospective\\" was in the editor's intro to some of the stories. He would tell us that the author wrote this andthat, and was famous for short story `X,' which, appeared in our magazine in 19XX... but here's story `Y' instead. Maybe they had printed the `famous' stories in other collections or something, but I would have preferred to read them instead of the alternate selections. In all of these cases (5 or 6, I believe) the story they gave was rather unimpressive, and served little purpose, except to make me wonder what I could have been reading instead.<br /><br />Anyway... This collection is out-of-print, but I would certainly recommend the six decent stories I mentioned above, if you are able to find them in a copy of this book or in another collection, which is probably your best bet.hort story `X,' which, appeared in our magazine in 19XX... but here's story `Y' instead.

This is of course, an idea we have all dreamed of... getting to relive your life with complete knowledge of what is going to happen. I heard the summary of this story and knew I had to read it.<br /><br />First there is the obvious- you know who will win the World Series, or what stocks are going to fly, so you take advantage of that and live large. You're 18, but you aren't as foolish as you were then, so relationships are a piece of cake. In short, you can do anything you ever dreamed of.

On his official website, George RR Martin said that Sharon Kay Penman was dynamite. I haven't read much Historical Fiction so far, but I've been wanting to for quite a while. I was interested in medieval England primarily, and I found the first book really cheap, so I dove in.<br /><br />Taking place in the 13th century, we are given the tale of the ruthless King John of England, and his greatest rival, Prince Llewelyn of Wales. To gain a hold over Wales, John marries his favorite daughter, Joanna, to the influential Welsh Prince. Joanna wants nothing less, but as she slowly begins to love her father's greatest enemy, she finds herself torn between the two powerful men. The romantic tale is merely a tiny aspect of this engrossing novel. You will also witness the warfare, politics and what life was like during this brutal period of English and Welsh history. I can think of nothing to compare it too except Braveheart, which is high praise from me. This book has everything in it. It's amazing how some of the best stories in the world actually happened.<br /><br />From what I've heard, and from the little I've witnessed, historical fiction usually means there will be a compromise in writing and story. Well, from page one, Penman grabbed me and wouldn't let go. After just this one book, she easily earns her place among my favorite authors. Here Be Dragons was simply captivating from beginning to end.	2003-01-21

Were I to review this book solely upon the quality of Wilson's writing, I would have also given it a higher score. But unfortunately, I must also take into account that this was simply not my cup of tea. It was very original, but as I read on, I found myself less interested in the story and more interested in picking out my next book.<br />The year is 2020, and a massive world war is coming. Nobody knows this until one morning, when a 200-foot tall monument shows up in Thailand- Announcing that someone named \\"Kuin\\" has conquered the country-Twenty years in the future. As more and more of these Chronoliths (victory monuments from the future) arrive in other countries and cities- the world erupts into panic.<br />There's not much more to the plot than this, but Wilson does a fine job choreographing the world's reaction to this bizarre attack from our future. With an expert understanding of sociology, Wilson depicts the way people might react to this kind of chaos, from the viewpoint of the government, the military, the economy, different generations and more. The book's atmosphere feels like the Cold War, or Vietnam as they were viewed from home. You can imagine yourself in that future world, glued to the TV- stunned and fearful of the news.<br />I love Sci-Fi, but I guess I needed something a little more fantastic or attention grabbing than this. Maybe I need more action or suspense. My main problem was that Wilson gives us many questions early in this book, but never really delivers any answers. The idea of the Chronoliths was neat. The setting was realistic and engaging. But the characters were merely decent, and the story itself... left me unsatisfied.	2002-10-30

I enjoyed many aspects of this book, but wasn't really hooked.<br />This is a 15th century historical fiction novel with only a hint of SF/F in it. I'd say there is only about 5% of the fantasy that you would find in your typical fantasy book- though I hear it becomes much more in the later books of the series. However, if you don't mind historical fiction, don't let this stop you.<br />The story is about Ash, a female commander of a mercenary company who does more than anyone thought a woman could in the 15th century. But here is where it really twists off from historical fiction: A great, unknown nation from Northern Africa invades Europe, bringing with it a large assortment of technological machines, featuring large brass golems. Ash and her army-for-hire end up in the middle of this nation-crushing conflict!<br />I loved the setting she chose for her story- a point in history where guns and canons have been incorporated into European combat, but archers, lances, and armor are still the main scene. And a mercenary band is ALWAYS great to read about in any book as far as I'm concerned. It was fun seeing how they operated autonomously- separate of any of the nations or religions of the time. They choose their contracts among themselves as a council. No matter what their political interests are, they pretty much want to make sure they are on the winning side!<br />The book started off very well, and drew me in, but by the end- I'm not really in any hurry to continue the series. In fact, it can't really be considered a series... From what I hear, you have to read all four books end-on-end to get the whole effect- and from the ending in this one book- that certainly seems the case.<br />One feeling I got was that Gentle seemed desperate to write women into history, or even this fictional history. I was quite fascinated with Ash's character at the start- \\"She's like Joan of Arc,\\" I thought. I'm interested. But then it starts to feel like Gentle is trying to show us that every time a woman is in charge- things get done right. But men are portrayed as completely incompetent or are good soldiers at best. Of course, one would have to admit that there are WAY MORE fantasy novels that cater to the opposite extreme, so one can't complain too loudly about the ladies getting the spotlight! :)<br />All in all, I didn't have any major gripes here- Just that Gentle's style didn't really keep me enthralled. So instead of grabbing book 2, I'm off to try my luck elsewhere!<br />-Lysanderen it starts to feel like Gentle is trying to show us that every time a woman is in charge- things get done right.

Someone else said that this is, \\"An excellent book for people who don't like to nitpick.\\" That is probably a perfect summary, but unfortunately, I'm the sort of reader who likes to pick nits.<br />The premise of Island is fantastic. Its back cover grabbed me right away. Who wouldn't want to go back in time with the Nantucketers and rewrite history? And so, the book starts off wonderfully: This guy is over here doing this, and this lady is over there doing that, and here comes a storm... BAM- Everyone is in 1250 B.C.! So, what do we do now?<br />Well, the characters react very believably to the crisis, and Stirling is very thorough in covering almost any type of concern that could have possibly come up. But then, it begins to feel like the Islanders were a bit *too* lucky. Turns out they have almost everything they could have wished for, including a professor of ancient cultures, and an expert sword-smith, both of whom just happened to be visiting the island. Then there's the Coast Guard sailing ship (rare), captained by a black, lesbian, master swordswoman... Followed by many more little things that make you wonder, \\"Now what are the odds of that?\\"<br />And this feeling grows worse... for me, it eventually became a case of, \\"Oh- Gimme a Break!\\" In fact, I think that their biggest dilemma with being thrown back 3250 years into the past- was that they ran out of coffee. Everything seems to work out overly perfect, and it gives you many little things to nitpick.<br />Even so, I found the book to be somewhat digestible until about it's midpoint. It was then that the islanders' main concern was no longer just survival. Now they have to react to a betrayal by some of their own. I found it kind of boring from this point on. The Islanders decide what they are going to do, and the next three hundred pages or so, play out exactly as they had planned, in a very predictable and insipid manner. Trudge. Trudge.<br />This book does have some terrific aspects and it can really get you thinking. But I found the characterizations to be flat, and the story was slow, predictable, and rather unrealistic at times.

Fall Of Hyperion was different in style, but I think I found it more entertaining.<br />In Hyperion, Simmons' format was the short story, where we were given each of the pilgrim's different tales, one at a time. By the end of each story you are intensely caught up in that pilgrim, and can't wait to see what happens to him (or her) next. But then Simmons is pretty much done with that character for the rest of the book, and moves on to the next with similar result. The waiting was agony- a true credit to his masterful ability.<br />In Fall of Hyperion (which is more like a normal novel), we finally find out what is in store for our pilgrims, and it was well worth the wait! Now he switches back and forth between each of the main characters on a regular basis, revealing a little more each time. Normally, when you have this many main characters, you find yourself bored by some, and can't wait to get back to others- In Fall Of Hyperion, I enjoyed each of them, almost equally, for one very smooth-paced, entertaining read.<br />The two books, together, make an amazing duology, with everything solved rather nicely by the end... Which leaves me quite curious as to what we will see in the next two!	2001-08-30

It was not the writing, or the fact that it followed Ender's Game closely. It was just overdone. Bean's \\"street urchin\\" background was excellent, and Card did a wonderful job distinguishing his personality from Ender's. But I was disappointed, however, with the way Card added meaning to many of the events we were familiar with from Game.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br />Now, BEAN made Ender's army -A well thought-out master plan, instead of being just another way the teachers had stacked the game against Ender. Now, BEAN was responsible for Ender's last (and greatest) victory at battle school. Even the deadline cord was now a result of some great victory BEAN won against the teachers, instead of just something he tried out in practice. In fact, Bean was able to figure out almost all of the things Ender couldn't... it's just that he decided to keep his thoughts to himself. Was *everything* the result of Bean's handy work?<br />*END of SPOILERS*<br /><br />Card should have left the original story \\"lean and mean\\" -the message just isn't the same any more. Too much credit was taken away from Ender, and handed to Bean. Of course, he had to bring Bean up to the lead role for this book, but Ender's tale was too much changed in the process. Everyone knows it was ENDER who could do what nobody else could. Now, we are told that Ender wasn't all that great... That he would have failed miserably had it not been for Bean.<br /><br />Other minor annoyances:<br />Ender's Game had little religion in it, (unlike the sequels), and that was something I felt should have been left out of Shadow as well. It just doesn't fit with the story's flow. Same with the constant use of Spanish... There was little of that in Ender's Game, and now, suddenly, it has been worked into nearly every character's dialogue. It breaks the smooth flow of the reading when you can't figure out what a character is saying. Maybe Card has some sort of agenda involving these two aspects in his books, but I found them simply annoying.Card has some sort of agenda involving these two aspects in his books, but I found them simply annoying.	2001-08-30

Like many of King's better novels, the \\"Rag\\", doesn't seem like a horror novel at the start. Instead, we are given an engaging mystery set in a real-life setting. But as you continue to turn the pages, you begin to get the sense that something is definitely not right, and eventually, we encounter the supernatural.<br />I highly recommend this book, but as I write this review, the question I ask myself is, \\"Exactly *whom* would I recommend it to?\\" When I first picked up the Rag, I was dubious. Of course I loved Song of Ice and Fire, and I found myself quite impressed with most of Martin's horror and sci-fi works as well... But I didn't have much confidence in an out-of-print horror book with a hippie/seventies/classic rock setting.<br />Fortunately, I read it anyway, or I would have missed out on one fabulous book.<br /> But will YOU like it?<br /> -If you occasionally find yourself enjoying episodes of VH1's Behind The Music, or the movie Almost Famous, you will appreciate Martin's meticulous attention to the music industry.<br /> -If you are a fan of Stephen King, The Rag will make you feel right at home.<br /> -And, if you've enjoyed any of Martin's other writings, you're sure to approve of his style here as well.<br />The bottom-line is, this is one book that truly doesn't deserve to be out-of-print, and thanks to Martin's rocketing popularity- it soon won't be. As soon as you can, give it a try!	2001-08-21

On one hand, George has delivered one of the most creative settings I've ever seen in Sci-Fi, complete with fascinating alien cultures. On the other hand, I felt quite dissatisfied with his main characters, and there was little action. However, it was still fun to see the master honing his skills.<br />The planet of Worlorn is a rogue, simply meandering through space on its own. Recently, it has come to drift near `The Wheel of Fire' -a constellation, which has brought it to life for a few decades. The wandering planet became a wonderful tourist attraction for a while... a festival, with fantastic cities built by each of the known races. Now, Worlorn is pulling away into cold darkness again, and its becoming uninhabitable once more. The Festival of Worlds has come to a close, yet a few people can still be found living among it's deserted cities as the planet slowly dies. Dirk travels here in answer to a call from his old lover, Gwen, and ends up the pawn of an intercultural conflict.<br />As I said before, this is a fantastic place I'd love to see with my own eyes, but the characters were too dry and unrealistic. There really wasn't any motivation to keep turning the pages here. Since reading A Song Of Ice And Fire, I've been hunting down all of George RR Martin's earlier out-of-print works, and have enjoyed the ones I've found quite a bit. He has quickly become my favorite author, but Dying Of The Light could have been skipped.	2001-05-29

Instead, what we have are varying shades of gray. (In that way only, would I compare it to George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire) The Black Company is a mercenary army...  and they've fallen on desperate times.<br />Some of its members honestly seem like they want to do the right thing. Some simply try to survive. And others will pillage, rape, or murder on occasion. This reminded me of some of the better Vietnam War films I've seen. Such harsh circumstances can lead to diminished morals in some men, and I enjoyed that element of realism.<br />Each chapter of this book reads like a separate mission, with its own conflict and resolution. This approach worked well here in  my opinion. Right from chapter one, we are introduced to the Black Company and plunged into action, through the writings of the army's annalist, Croaker. Unfortunately, you may feel like you've missed some important details, as Cook bombards you with names, events, and his advanced vocabulary. He doesn't explain everything very well at first, and it can be quite confusing.<br />After finishing the second chapter, I went and reread the first chapter to iron out some details, and that helped out quite a bit. From then on, it was smooth sailing and well worth my patience. With plenty of action, and a few laughs- this was a pretty entertaining read!	2001-05-29

NIGHTFLYERS is one of the few I have found thus far, and it was well worth my effort. It contains six excellent short stories of horror and science fiction.<br />The title-novelette, \\"Nightflyers\\" is by far the best... A team of nine specialists takes flight on the Nightflyer in pursuit of a legendary alien spacecraft, eons old. But things on the Nightflyer aren't exactly as they seem, and it's captain isn't sharing all he knows.<br /><br /> \\"Override\\" and \\"A Song For Lya\\" are two more great pieces, but they can also be found in another of his collections, A SONG FOR LYA. A fourth great story, \\"Weekend In A War Zone\\" takes a look at one of our future forms of entertainment- recreational warfare! I wouldn't have minded if that story were a lot longer.<br />The last two stories are just ok, but all in all, this collection is well worth your time. Because of his recent popularity, Martin's older works should be hitting shelves again soon, but if you can't take the wait- check the libraries and used bookstores like I did	2001-05-03

It was twenty-years old, and had an ugly cover, so I figured A SONG FOR LYA was out-of-print for a good reason. But since being blown away by A GAME OF THRONES, I have yet to find anything of Martin's less than superb. This short, but fabulous book turned out to be no exception.<br /><br />Sci-Fi and Horror are blended to excellent result in this collection of 10 short stories, featuring telepaths, ghosts, strange life forms, and very imaginative worlds. The standouts were \\"With Morning Comes Mistfall\\", \\"Override\\", and the Hugo Award-Winning title-story, \\"A Song For Lya\\", but in truth- there wasn't a bad apple in the bunch.<br /><br />My personal favorite was, \\"Dark, Dark Were The Tunnels\\" where Nuclear Armageddon has destroyed the face of the Earth long ago, and only two groups of people have survived. It took me a few pages to realize just what I was reading, but then it really pulled me in!<br /><br />Several of these stories have also appeared in Martin's later collections, but unfortunately, they too are all out-of-print at the moment. However, the popularity of A Song Of Ice And Fire means that many of these collections and stories will soon be republished in the near future. So if you can't find them in libraries or used bookstores... be patient!	2001-05-03

G RR Martin has firmly secured his place as my favorite fantasy author to date! I never thought he'd top Game of Thrones, let alone *this* dramatically. Even though it was 920 pages long, it wasn't nearly enough. I am in agony waiting for the next installment... Nothing I have read since has been able to ease the pain!<br />Who will survive the Storm of Swords? Don't bother trying to guess, because Martin's tale of too-many-kings NEVER leads where you expect it to, and his pen may kill even main characters at any moment. Time and time again he builds up the suspense until you want to scream. And just then... when he has you in the palm of his hand waiting to see what happens next- he does nothing short of blow you away!<br />Hurry up DANCE WITH DRAGONS!

All eyes now turn to Hyperion, a mysterious planet which holds the fate of mankind.<br />Seven pilgrims have been chosen to make a final journey to Hyperion because of their remarkable connections with the planet and its horrific protector- the Shrike! Prepare to be blown away as each of the pilgrims share their bewildering tales, and try to solve this great riddle.<br />That is pretty much all this book is- a very complex collection of short stories, which serve to `set the stage' for the concluding novel, FALL OF HYPERION. But don't get me wrong... This is an outstanding book, for each of these short stories is so unique and riveting- you will be left in awe! Simmons has combined action, mystery, horror, and futuristic fantasy with outstanding ability. One of the tales in particular, was so heart-wrenching that I almost had to put the book down!<br />Hyperion has won the Hugo Award for a reason, and it is definitely a must for any fan of fantasy and sci-fi.  I would say it compares quite admirably with the original Foundation Trilogy- Highly recommended!	2001-03-13

I want to be a Vampire!<br />I am just a novice when it comes to vampire tales or the horror genre, but even so, Interview is right at the top of my list of all-time favorite books.<br />Louis is an ancient vampire who is tired of living in secrecy. When a young journalist offers to interview him- we are given a tale we will never forget! Beginning in colonial New Orleans, Louis tells of his days as a plantation owner, how he met Lestat, and how his life was forever changed.<br />Without a doubt, this is a monumental classic. It's immense popularity is well deserved! But although it is labeled `horror', I would recommend it highly to any fan of fantasy as well, for it is truly one of the finest books you may ever get your hands on.<br />-There are several other books in this series as well, but from what I hear, they fail to hold a candle. I only tried The Vampire Lestat (2nd book), which didn't hold my interest for very long. But like Dune or Ender's Game- the first book of this series, at least, is a must read!	2001-03-13

Surprisingly, it was far superior.<br />I've seen dozens of fantasy epics featuring the \\"orphan kid who grows up to save the kingdom,\\" but this one grabbed me right away and kept me glued with its steady flow of action.<br />The RIFTWAR SAGA, at first glance, seems to be your standard fantasy setting with elves, dwarves and the generic goblins and monsters... but Feist's interesting system of magic, and the idea of the \\"rifts\\" that allow the enemy to invade -bring new life to the formula making MAGICIAN very worth while.<br />-As someone else said- this is indeed a great introduction to fantasy reading!	2001-02-17

Don't get me wrong- I still loved it, but the ending let me down. (and many other readers I think) I can't help but get the impression that Hobb wanted to write a forth book to wrap it up (but was pressured not to by publishers), and its a shame she didn't take it, because the end result seemed rushed and chaotic, and just plain sloppy.<br />From having been a well-laid out, intelligent and gritty novel that kept you on your knees waiting to see how it would end- it went on to a hasty, summed-up ending that was a shadow of Hobb's ability. If ever an ending needed to be redone- its here. No dragons. Just a simple, bloody, final confrontation, as in the first two books- and this series would have ended solidly. I would gladly buy a revised copy if she ever makes one, for I will certainly reread this series down the line.	2001-02-08

This book came highly recommended, but as I began reading it I was afraid it would fail to hold my interest. I tend to prefer literature of the more adventurous sort -A thousand pages of monks and masons is normally something I'd quickly avoid.<br />But as I invested more time, the author's contagious enthusiasm for the subject and his very convincing historical backdrop enchanted me. I found it harder and harder to put the book down at the end of each night. Still, there were elements that prevent me from overly praising Pillars Of The Earth...<br />I don't consider myself particularly timid when it comes to sex in a novel, but in this case it was just too often and too out of place. I constantly found my enchantment broken by Follet's excessively descriptive sex scenes and accounts of brutal rape.<br />Also annoying, was the unrelenting flow of evil from Lord William and Priest Waleran -It was too much to swallow. Over and over again the reader is barraged by endless conflicts and resolutions. One climax after another until by the end I just wasn't concerned for the characters anymore.<br />Even so, this is a magnificent read- one of the best I've had. Give it a try!	2001-02-06

I loved the first four books of Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, but apparently he lost his way in Fort At River's Bend (book 5). Now in Sorcerer, he has recovered quite a bit, but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.<br />Finally, Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died, as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman, and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer, and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.<br />Unfortunately, the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books, he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.<br /> It's a shame, but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out.	2001-01-23

They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.<br />Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.	2001-01-03

The premise, setting, description, and characters were decent enough and it was quite unlike most other fantasy I've read. But it didn't really capture my imagination as it had theirs.

There isn't much of a plot.

Dros Delnoch- a mighty fortress indeed, but they have but a few farmers to protect it with... and Druss the Legend. Will they be able to hold back the never-ending tide of Nadir warriors?

As usual, he does some bar crawling, sleeps with some  gorgeous women, and after a variety of brawls, he of course stops the evil  wizard.<br />-If you are looking for more \\"Wheel of Time\\" you are likely to  be disappointed -but it is fun watching Jordan hone his skills.<br />-As far  as Conan goes, I hear R E Howard's works are the best -so you might want to  look there instead.

I picked up this book as a fan of Jordan's Wheel of Time, and the Schwarzenegger Conan movies. I figure put the two together and we're in business. Well... The three stories in this book have pretty much nothing to  do with one another other than being vaguely chronological, and sharing one  or two supporting characters. They were entertaining, but involved no  development for our hero at all. It was like Jordan merely borrowed Conan  and then put him back the way he found him. Unchanged- for better or worse.  Much like a Bond movie. Not exactly my taste, but if that is fine with you-  give it a shot!<br />In CONAN the INVINCIBLE, the barbarian/thief is hired  by a nasty ol' wizard to steal five precious gems from a King's throne room  only to find that someone has beaten him to it. Conan is apparently never  fazed by anything, and of course pursues the rival thieves. He will stop at  nothing to get his reward. This brings him face to face with several perils  including an army of the King's men, the mysterious Red Hawk and her band  of caravan-raiding bandits, as well as another evil wizard and his army of  Lizard men. I give it a 3.<br />In CONAN the DEFENDER, our hero arrives in the  city of Belverus to, again, find work to fill his gold purse. His plan is  to raise his own company of warriors, but Civil war threatens the Kingdom-  and he must choose sides between his friends and the King. But first he  must find out who has been trying to kill him and why. I give this a 3  also.<br />In CONAN the UNCONQUERED, the barbarian once again arrives in a new  city looking for a way to fill his pockets with gold and manages to end up  knee deep in trouble. As usual, he does some bar crawling, sleeps with some  gorgeous women, and of course- stops the evil wizard. This story was not as  good as the other two in my opinion, but it was ok. I give it a 2.<br />Over  all I gave this book a 3 because the three stories were almost exact  replicas of one another. By the end, I was bored and had heard it all  before. However, you could do worse than this book if looking for a quick  read, but in general I'd only recommend it to a younger audience.<br />-If  you are looking for more \\"Wheel of Time\\" you are likely to be disappointed  -but it is fun watching Jordan hone his skills.<br />-As far as Conan goes,  I hear R E Howard's works are the best -so you might want to look there  instead.

There are like seven would-be Kings and Queens trying to take over the Seven Kingdoms! I haven't seen anything like it- Armies crawling all over the countryside. All throughout this book you find yourself trying  to imagine who will run into whom. Hoping so-and-so gets his hands on this  guy, and so on. And when they do encounter each other- it's incredible! You  will love this series!<br />This story is told from the point-of-view of nine  (at present) distinct main characters with a great supporting cast, and  while some feel this gets too confusing- I love it. It feels like you are  reading nine stories at the same time. Most are excellent... Sansa and  Catelyn might have to go if they don't get better, but Tyrion is one of my  favorite characters ever. What really rivets you is the fact that Martin is  not afraid to kill off his characters. Not like in Wheel of Time where  everyone manages to escape or make a comeback (look for Moiraine and  Lanfear in the next one).<br />One small factor does manage to irk me... the  language. Not the cursing mind you. That was used rather tastefully and not  over done. What I refer to is the annoying speech habits of certain  characters... The Crow was fine yelling, \\"Corn!\\" or whatever, but then you  have the alchemist saying \\"...hmmm.\\" in every sentence, Stannis' fool with,  \\"I know! I know! Oh! Oh!\\" and there's a few others not to mention HODOR!  This was annoying, but just a minor gripe.<br />I don't feel it was quite as  good as Game of Thrones, but it sure comes close, and still enough for a \\"5  star\\". Martin's plotting and dialogue are truly masterful and you'd be a  fool to pass up on reading this series (6 books projected).

I know a few who own and love the movie but have never read the book. I have lent DUNE to friends who could get no further than page 20 because it was too  \\"out there\\" or too difficult, with its array of characters and glossary of  made-up terms. But of all the people who have gotten past page 20- I don't  know one who doesn't praise it among their absolute favorites.  I am no  exception.<br />I love sci-fi but don't read much of it because I prefer  fantasy. DUNE feels like a perfect blend of the two. A war of noble houses  set in space. Paul Atreides is heir to the duchy- and to say that he is  well trained for the job would be an understatement. His father, Duke Leto,  is given charge of Arrakis- a hellish desert-world and the sole source of  \\"the spice\\" which the entire universe needs.  A very prestigious  assignment, but treachery and peril comes with it. Paul finds himself  thrown into the mystery of Dune and its fierce natives, the Fremen. Is he  the savior their prophecy speaks of?<br />I was first blown away by DUNE at  the age of 16, and have since considered it \\"the one to beat\\". In 8 years,  very few books have made me question that judgment: Game of Thrones,  Foundation, Lord of the Rings, Ender's Game. I had to reread it to be sure  I wasn't just naïve at the time. Was it really THAT great? Absolutely.	2000-05-15
US	52240388	R2EXY7WM9940H0	0812513940	1380728	Conan The Defender	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Pretty good	I picked up this book as a fan of Jordan's Wheel of Time, and the Schwarzenegger Conan movies. I figure put the two together and we're in business. I gotta tell ya... That wasn't far from the truth.<br />In &quot;Conan the Defender&quot;, our hero arrives in the city of Belverus to, again, find work to fill his gold purse. His plan is to raise his own company of warriors, but Civil war threatens in the Kingdom- and he must choose sides between his friends and the King. But first he must find out who has been trying to kill him and why.<br />-I can't compare this to R. E. Howard's works, (I haven't read any yet) but this has sure made me open to checking those out in the future. An enjoyable read.<br /> -And sure it's not Wheel of Time, but I can definitely see the seeds of a great author taking root.	2000-04-26

I went through various stages of opinion while reading this book... First was, \\"Hey- why is this nothing like Ender's Game? Drats!\\" Then, \\"What is with all this Portuguese stuff, and religious garbage?\\" and \\"Why is Ender  some kind of space-detective?\\" And so I began trudging through this book  with a lack of enthusiasm. Then slowly but steadily, this story pulls you  in. You don't mind the lack of Game's glorious action. This is a very  mature piece.<br />I doubt that anyone will be able to read Ender's Game and  stop there. You want more. Speaker for the Dead is where you have to go. I  find it extremely hard to consider this a sequel, because never have I seen  an author switch his style this drastically within one series. Card forces  you to accept all of his changes, but those who adapt to this book are  highly rewarded! I found myself involved with Card's characters quite  alarmingly, and touched by his themes on so many levels.<br />One thing that  really impressed me- Card takes our first intelligent contact with aliens  and compares it with 16th century European explorers encountering the  natives of South America. It shows the barriers of language, technology,  religion, and misunderstandings -as well as mankind's need to control or  dominate any new race it meets. This book is like a history lesson that  teaches us not to make the same mistakes when we reach this point of our  future. Very interesting.<br />There is no doubt I will be continuing this  series.	2000-04-25

How can you consider yourself a fan of Science Fiction if you've never read Ender's Game? Actually... I only just read it a month ago- but boy am I ashamed of myself for having waited so long! I had to read it again a week ago since I couldn't believe I'd loved it so much, and when phrases like, \\"The best book I've ever read!\\" come to your mind- you'd better be pretty  certain. It goes high on my list with Dune and very few others. It will  enrapture you.<br />The story is simple. It is the future. The Earth has had  a severe run-in with a race of hostile aliens we call the \\"Buggers\\". They  have invaded our planet twice, nearly wiping us out if it weren't for some  amazing luck. Now, decades later, the Earth prepares to retaliate against  the Buggers- defeat them before a third invasion can be launched against  us. We have a massive fleet, but need a leader. With that in mind, the  military turns to children for salvation... filtering out the most brilliant  strategic minds and molding them into commanders with what it takes to win  the war. At age 6, Andrew Wiggen (ENDER) is their best hope. This is the  story of his trials and training and SO much more.<br />Card does everything  right in Ender's Game. As a 24 year-old, I couldn't recommend any book  higher. If you are new to sci-fi, this will get you addicted. ............	2000-04-25

Light Fantastic is here to the Rescue answering all questions and concluding the story that started it  all.<br />Once again Terry has collected an off-the-wall collection of  humorous encounters for our heroes. Rincewind and friends must once again  save the world. One of the world's eight most powerful spells is hiding in  his head, and the wrong people want it. So he must call upon all his finely  tuned abilities... of running away! Twoflower and the Luggage are there to  help along with Diskworld's greatest warrior... who is now a ridiculously old  man.<br />-Many people consider this one to be better than CoM... They are  both awesome. End of story. However, they are both too short and should  have come in one normal sized book.<br />-F.Y.I- The next book is Sourcery.  Equal Rights was written next, but has no Rincewind and is generally not  considered one of Pratchett's better works.	2000-04-07

This is a meticulous epic of nobles, knights, kings, and traitors set to a very subtle fantasy backdrop, which pulls you in deeper with every page.  A Game of Thrones is quite easily the best single fantasy novel I've ever read- and there have been many.  So it stands to reason that you just might  enjoy it yourself!<br />I've never seen an author so consistently brilliant  as Martin has been in these 835 pages. This is no fluke. After just this  one book, I am positive that he is one of the top three talents in the  Fantasy genre.  Tolkien... Jordan...  Hobbs... Watch out for George R. R.  Martin- He has his eyes on the throne!<br />-There are some who feel this  story has too many main characters. That it is too confusing. Any veteran  of Jordan will take to GoT like a duck to water. In fact, pick out your  favorite Wheel of Time book... This destroys it.<br />-Want more? Heard of  that short story collection called \\"Legends\\" featuring all the modern  masters of fantasy? Do NOT miss Martin's \\"The Hedge Knight\\" -It's Dynamite!	2000-04-02
US	52240388	R1P7RXSBEQRMSK	0061020710	181852028	The Color of Magic	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Pratchett's a riot!	This is my second time reading this awesome book. The first was when I was 17 and new to fantasy. This book played a huge role in getting me hooked. I had previously read only dungeons and dragons novels such as Chronicles,  and this was my first step away from that. It was the funniest thing I'd  ever read.<br />Now I am revisiting it as a 25-year-old and its still a blast  as his style and wit make a mockery of the epic fantasy most of us are used  to. It is so refreshing! I'd give it five stars, but as someone else says,  &quot;Pratchett gets better in later books.&quot;<br />Rincewind is a wizard,  but due to a technicality- he is unable to cast a single spell throughout  the book! Instead he manages to escape DEATH himself, a various assortment  of Diskworld's gods, thieves, assassins, a city-engulfing fire, magicians,  dragons, and monsters -thanks to an overly developed sense of cowardice and  some very odd allies. They include a four-eyed insurance salesman on  vacation, a talking sword, a demon camera, and a treasure-chest that run  and eat people! This may sound ridiculous, but it is so well done that  beginners and veteran fantasy readers alike will laugh aloud through out  this one.<br /> Read The Light Fantastic afterwards. It concludes what Colour  Of Magic starts without slowing down the pace and humor at all! And There's  more Rincewind books after that. They are next on my list!	2000-03-28

Fans of Deverry might want to give me a beating here, but in my opinion- Kerr is definitely capable of better stuff. Until I got to this book, everything she put out amazed me. I even gave Bristling Wood 5 stars.  Through out Dragon Revenant there were some traces of the Katherine Kerr I  know and love- especially in the beginning and the end, but the middle (the  entire portion that involved Rhodry as a slave) bored me and dragged out  for way too long. I kept waiting for Kerr to erupt into one of her  trademark flashback sequences- but was left hanging. I respect the  possibility that maybe she was bored of doing this, but I still want to  know how the Silver Dagger group's origin story turns out- a tale left  unfinished from the middle of the last book.<br />I have a confession to  make... Halfway through, I quite frankly gave up on this book and went on to  read twelve other books. But for the first time in my life I resumed  reading a book I had given up on- This was solely because of how much I  enjoyed her first three books, and my hope that the next few would be up to  her usual par.<br />A few things did impress me here though. Salamander- a  very interesting character is fleshed out for the first time. Kerr's  dialogue and Deverry's culture give her works a wonderful feel. I would  have enjoyed a grander resolution between Rhodry and his brother/enemy  Rhys, but the ending made the book worth while with several surprises and a  very neat closure to the whole series. Or was this just a bridge? On to  Omens and Exile for the answers I go. And I can't wait to get to Dragon  Mage since I previewed the first chapter- looks exciting!	2000-03-15

The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic were Pratchett's first two novels, and possibly the  funniest stuff I've read yet. I'm usually into the more serious works of  fantasy fiction, but reading this parody of the genre left me in stictches.<br />It takes a bit to get into it because it starts off by describing this  world as being a flat disk carried on the back of four giant elephants who  in turn, are on top of a enormous turtle. Don't ask.  Then we meet our  heroes: A short tourist with four eyes who doesnt speak the language, and  has enough gold to capture the attention of every lowlife thief and robber.  The tourist's luggage which is made from the magical wood of a special pear  tree and as a result- it has a mind of its own, many feet and teeth and  follows the tourist everywhere. And the third main character is  Rincewind... a failed, coward of a wizzard who can't learn any new spells  because he accidentally memorized one of the eight most powerful spells on  the disk- a spell so powerful that no one knows what it does and he dare  not say it. In fact all other spells are AFRAID to go near it.<br />This is  just the beginning. Pratchett's wit and spaced-out imagination take the  reader on a wild ride where nothing in fantasy is sacred.  Now these first  two books come together in one book, and I say thats the way they should  have come from the beginning. The first book ends with a cliff-hanger  (disk-hanger) that is neatly resolved in the second story. And hardcover is  a plus, because this IS a classic that belongs on any fan's shelf. It is  highly recommended as a breath of fresh air to any fantasy fan- serious or  not.<br />I think I liked it even better the first time I read it eight years  ago at 16. Oh... and if you are Brittish- add one star! They all love  Pratchett!<br />Also, if you liked this one- you might enjoy Robert Asprin's  Another Fine Myth. It has the same type of fantasy-mocking humor. It's not  bad!Asprin's  Another Fine Myth. It has the same type of fantasy-mocking humor. It's not  bad!	2000-02-23

I often consult amazon and the fantasy finder page before deciding what to read next, and of all the advice I took from these pages and its readers, this trillogy didn't work  out for me at all. Undeniably a well developed world, but the characters  made me want to cry. So dull! To a person who likes high action, this  series seemed to drag on for ever. With all the praise this book had  recieved I felt obligated to follow through and finish the whole thing- It  had to really take off sooner or later... nope! There's no denying that  this series has a strong following, but if it's action in a fantasy novel  that turns you on- pass this one by. PS: Don't vote this review as  &quot;unhelpful&quot; if you simply disagree with it... There are many who  agree with me that it's not for everyone.	2000-01-31

I have been using the top 100 fantasy web pageto get ideas of what to read, and for the most part, the favorites of the masses have been helpful recommendations. This  book was ranked rather high, so I kept an eye out for it... for two years.  Nowhere to be found. Even here. Yet you can read here that its won some  prestigeous awards. After finally finding a copy in a dusty library, I  rushed home to read it aware that it had been built up in my mind for all  this time- and it in no way disappointed! A decent culture, and fun delemas  and situations, but what made this stand alone story really shine was the  characters. Nothing steriotypical about them. They are real people in a  very imaginative, yet realistic world. It may be tough at first to get used  to his style, and the speaking habits of his characters, but twenty pages  in it doesnt phase you, and by the end of the book you want more.	2000-01-25

That one let me down. But as it turns  out, I made a great decision! The only problem I had was that she dove into  her best flashback sequence ever in the forging of the silver dagger group,  but then she proceeded to leave us hanging.... in the middle of that story  she returns to the current story which I found to be less intriging... and  then she never picks up the other story. A huge disappointment! And I may  never know because the next book failed to keep my intrest after 300 pages  of trudging. So close to finishing The Dragon Revenant, and I had to put it  down in disgust.	1999-10-26

I picked this book off the shelf, because I saw the Romans on the cover of a book in the fantasy section I religeously stick too. Then I read the back and was pleasantly astonished to see it was an Arthurian novel, and highly  praised at that. I had yet to see a fantasy or historical fiction novel to  be rooted in the Roman Empire, and after little thought I brought it home  to my collection to be read later... I should have read it right away! It  was refreshingly more adult then the fantasy norm. It was an education in  the practices of the Roman Empire, and the roots of Brittain. Furthermore,  I realized from the 10th or so page, that it lacked any monsters or  conventional magic in the fantasy sense, and I never missed it once. In  fact it seems to be his goal to explain every one of the magical legends  and mysteries of Arthur and his world in tangable and realistic means- To  make them perfectly feasable. He is well researched. And my GOD! I'm nearly  ready to believe... but this is one book down, and I have at least four  more to go depending on where he takes it.<br />Two minor annoyances: the  vomiting thing everyone is talking about, and the fact that Luceeia(so  attractive), gets with Publius so quickly. A little more subtle in both  categories, and then an otherwise perfect book.<br />I'd give it a 4 and a  half if I could, in order to leave room for such classics as Royal Assassin  by Robin Hobb, Daggerspell by Katherin Kerr, Foundation by Asimov, Dune by  Frank Herbert which I also would give 4 and 1/2 or 5 stars. I usually don't  review books here, but this one book, Skystone, is grossly  under-appreciated from what I can tell! Only 9 reviews on such a classic  book?! You need beter advertisement or something!<br />And furthermore...  where can I get a hard-cover version of Skystone?!	1999-06-17
