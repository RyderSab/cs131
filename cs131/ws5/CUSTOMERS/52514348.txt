Each character, human and animal is magically drawn and stays in your  mind for a lifetime. Not bad.  And its charming and funny and touching.

The most impressive part of this book to me is where Hill encourages one  to gather a bunch of experts in the next dimension (people who have died  for exa) and have them give guidance during meditation.  I gathered a  committee such as Cayce for clairvoyance, Shakespeare to help me with  writing, John Lennon with music, etc.  Its fun to meditate, having these  and others talk  together and help me.

The line that haunted me for years is: If there is 1% chance you will be  killed, that is too great of a chance.  I only wish that Nicole Simpson had  read/or acted on the advice in this book.  (My opinion, obviously).     The  book helped me spot abusers on the first date, rather than 2 dangerous  months later.... And best of all it gives strategys for departure. Another  memorable line:  &quot;Its easier for men to  be cured of leprosy and than  abusing women, EVEN WHEN THEY WANT TO BE CURED!&quot;  I have recommended  this to dozens of friends and clients.

It gives the spiritual foundation to wealth.  It  helps one realize that God is the source of our supply, not our job, our  husband, etc.  When the principles of this book are applied both to the  letter and the spirit of the law, one's wealth doubles and doubles and  doubles.  A good companion to this book is: The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity  by Catherine Ponder and Goldsmith's Practicing the Presence.  I call this  one my Prosperity Bible. I have read it at least six times.  Each time I  read it, I ask my self, &quot;What else am I not doing (recommended by this  book), that I could improve?&quot; and then I do  that and my wealth  increases substantially yet again.

I had two sad divorces, now one happy marriage	This book was the clincher for what ailed me besides all the other stuff.  Yes, I had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, was an ACOA, incest survivor,  negative thinker, etc...but after years of therapy, 12-steps, Unity, etc.  etc. I was still suffering, and still acting bizzare in some ways. After  reading this book cover to cover, finding a psychiatrist to give me  Wellbutrin, my life started to work. Relationships had time to blossom and  mature, and love finally stopped eluding me.    I owe it all to this  wonderful breakthrough book!  I am devotedly holistic in my life, am a  psychic/and spiritual healer professionally, and yet I find I STILL need  medication to help my seratonin.  I call it &quot;glasses for the  brain&quot;.  On days I forget to take it, I am still in my jammies by  noon.  When I take it first thing in the morning, I am functioning  effectively in 20 minutes flat.  My gratitude to the authors and to the  makers of Wellbutrin!  The book helped me understand my self, my history,  my behavior, my inconsistency, and the reasons I couldn't finish college or  the dishes! Wheh!  If you suspect you have this disorder, I urge you to get  the book.    Blessings, Linda Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

It was a door opener to my history, my identity, my relationship patterns (and failures), my addictions, etc. etc.  Some books are turning points.  This one is a MAJOR PIVOT!  I encourage anyone who thinks they may remotely identify with this book to get it. Then go immediately to an Adult Children of Alcoholics 12-step meeting..even before it comes in the mail.  And listen.  Find out that you may be one of 4 family types: hero, mascot, rebel or invisible one. Find out that the &quot;elephant in the living room&quot; is alcholism and that its not your fault and that you couldn't stop it, prevent it, or rescue them or yourself from it.  But find out what recovery is like..that there is life after trauma.  This book will be a powerful guide to all thats been hurting you. God bless you in your journey!  Go to at least six meetings before you decide its not for you.  Take kleenex.  And listen! Someone will tell your life story within six meetings. How to find a meeting? Call your local AA number and ask them where the ACOA or ACA meetings are.  If they don't have them in your area, ask for CODA (codependents anonymous), if they don't have them, ask for Al-anon.

Most likely, a person of  the Christian Science Religion would write about this amazing book. The  book IS AMAZING.  It was written by a woman in the l800's.  In my opinion,  she was absolutely brilliant, but also a &quot;channel&quot; of higher  spirituality.  This is where the C.S. would differ  with me.      The  language is so advanced/awkward at times, and yet it has a breathtaking  aliveness and beauty , poetic and profound that it cannot be overlooked as  one of the most majestic and powerful books on healing in this century.        I feel a kind of &quot;electrical buzz&quot; in my mind as the truth  scintilates through my being, head to toe in certain passages.       I  encourage any one to attend a Testimony meeting on Wednesday nights ...even  a non C.S. It is a wonderful testimony to healing that is lacking in most  Christian denominations.      My greatest argument with the author of this  book is the amount of control she left over the followers...too much  rigidity of application, in my opinion.     I truly believe that God can  heal us with prayer.  Unfortunately, I do feel that many people are lacking  the spiritual understanding as yet, to fully manifest such a healing.  In  certain cases, I feel this can be tragic, when doctors, who God ALSO  Created, could possibly have helped.     So, although I love the book and  its principles, I hold a bit of reservation in how it is most commonly  applied within the strictures of its church.      Read the book in spite of  what I have said, and be blessed! Linda Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

Dr. Phelps makes such a brilliant and provocative case for the  biochemistry of addiction.     You either have the &quot;bad&quot; genes or  you don't. It removes the stigma of alcoholism etc. and brings the issue  down to understanding your biochemistry and managing it appropriately.   Although I don't smoke, drink or use drugs, I discovered through the  questionnaire that I am a High Addictor (based on family patterns of  addiction).  Sure enough, when I removed seemingly harmless foods from my  diet, (sugar, white rice, white flour, caffeine), my focus sharpened  dramatically, I lost over 15 pounds, and my emotional mood swings stopped.      I managed to maintain this &quot;eatting program&quot; for over a year.  Regrettably, I fell back during the Holidays and have yet to fully  re-establish the discipline that made me feel so MUCH BETTER!     You'll be  glad you read this book, and like me you will recommend it to countless  people.

Let me preface this with the fact that I have been studying metaphysics  and actively applying the principles for more than 20 years.  I find this  book to be more clear in thought than most of the Unity, Christian Science  and other spiritual/new age books I have read and enjoyed. (countless  books....100's literally).    Mr. Goldsmith is a Master and  Master  teacher. If you are mature enough to encounter him, you are ready for the  biggest and most positive  transformation of your life.  I read pgs. 1-83  of  this book and my income doubled practically overnight.       There is a  quote on pg. 83 that I have distributed to clients all over the country.  &quot;Are we that which receives, or are we that center from which the  infinity of God flows out?  Are we the multitudes who sat at the feet of  the  Master waiting to be fed, or are we the Christ feeding the  unillumined?  In the answer to that lies our degree of spiritual  fulfillment.&quot;    I might add that someone gave me a Goldsmith book  about 7 years ago, and I couldn't get into it at all.  After spiritually  maturing, I find him refreshing, illuminating and a true God-send! I am to  the point where if I had to eliminate all authors but one from my  bookshelves, I'd keep Goldsmith.  I am currently reading about three of his  books simultaneously.  They are deep and rich.  They take time, but they  give so very very much!   I would welcome comments from anyone who is  touched by Goldsmith. Linda Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

I  review it to give another  sufferer of secrets the courage to buy this book and begin the long journey  to emotional/mental/spiritual/physical wholeness.     It will turn you  inside out, probably, but it will get the garbage out in the process.  Not  to read alone.  Its too scarey. Order it, and get a therapist, or at  minimum a group such as Survivors of Incest Anonymous or Adults Molested as  Children.  Even if you don't remember anything. Even if you're not sure you  need it. Even if someone suggested you get this, but you think they are  crazy.  Still, I say, get it!      I have owned it about 10 years and have  never read the entire book. Many pages have reduced me to a pile of rubble,  garbled words and hopeless tears.  But surprise!  They were not hopeless  ultimately!  They were healing and resolving.     I went to a workshop with  one of the authors and in person she was as fabulous and loving as she was  in writing this book.       This book frees women from slavery from the  shadowy, murky past.       1 in 3 American women are incest survivors, 1 in  5 men are.  If you're a man, you can still get a lot from this book.  The  issues are the same:  Betrayal, boundary bashing, innocence lost, self  esteem destruction, splitting, etc. etc.    God Bless you for your courage  to order and read this book!

It is in the  same format as a good book of modern music, slick cover, etc.     I feel  the information was incredibly thorough as far as listing the names and  wanted features in old music.   It specializes in piano sheet music,  first  editions and pretty covers, for the most part.     As a rank beginner in  this field, I had hoped for more tips as to where and how to sell one's  &quot;find&quot; if they were lucky enough to have one.      I would have  enjoyed knowing more basics about  collecting music.  Are there shows? How  has the value of music increased over time?      I didn't realize the book  would only cover individual sheet music...no collections of songs, no  teaching materials, etc.  I would have also wished for a way to tell who  had done the front designs (none of mine gave obvious artists credits), and  how to determine more easily if one had a first edition or not.        I  have a container of old music that stacks three feet deep and four feet  long and two feet wide, yet not one piece qualified.  Nevertheless, I think  I will keep the book in my car for future garage sale forages.  You never  know!      I had some pieces that I felt might potentially have a market  that were not in the list, but overall the list was exhaustive.      I am  very impressed by the work that went into this book.        One other thing  I liked is that the values have been updated in l997 so its newer than the   description really sites.      I am glad this book exists. Linda  Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

I had no boundaries and couldn't begin to honor a man's need  for space or cave time.   This book taught me not to take it personally.  The best compliment I could get from my husband last night was this:  I  love you as my wife because you give me the freedom to be me.     Two  ex-husbands told me the opposite... You never let me have any time to  myself.    Thank you John Gray.  And its wonderful you're on Oprah on  Wednesdays now!  Linda Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

They have run together in my mind...like dreams that continue on and on.  But such a beautiful consciousness.      I actually don't read them from  front to back. I sit and meditate a moment, eyes closed, ask a deep and  silent question that I need help with, and then randomly open a page and  point. The  ANSWER IS ALWAYS THERE.  Better than I Ching, astrology, or  anything I've found. Brilliant, sensitive, thoughtful.  Not everyone will  appreciate them. You are ready or not for such books.  If you have found  your way to this review...I suspect you are ready!    Love and blessings  for happy spiritual enfoldment...and after this, try Goldsmith! Linda  Schiller-Hanna	1998-10-16

I don't feel deprived.  A client told me she lost 60 pounds on it.  That  she'd tried it all. I was desperate enough with middle age spread to give  it a go.    Lost 6 pounds in about 15 days.  Easiest weight loss I've ever  had.  Most positive energy, least feeling of deprivation.     I want to  shout it from the rooftops: Try This One!    I tend towards hypoglycemia  and have the  Hidden Addiction (see review on that book), have ADD and get  light-headed when hungry. This book gives me the bulk I need, the choices I  like and the feeling of satisfaction that I  can stay with over time.     A  good solution to a complex problem. Thanks Barry!
