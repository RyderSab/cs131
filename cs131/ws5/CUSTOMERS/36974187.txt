US	36974187	R2QB8B38A6REVY	0310209307	938771460	The Case for Christ:  A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus	Books	3	10	11	N	N	A balanced review?	A quick summary of the review: this is not an exhaustive book on the evidence for Jesus as the Messiah (i.e., the Christ), but rather an overview of the possibilities. I'm not even sure it's meant to be, in itself, completely convicting (i.e., readers put the book down convinced of Christianity's truth claims and become believers themselves), but rather, convince the reader that there is a reasonable possibility that the historical claims of Christianity are in fact based on true fact. In that sense, he succeeded with me. Sure, he pulled his punches, and he certainly didn't think of all the objections to Christianity I have.  <br /> <br />However, that's not even the point. The final section of the book, within its conclusion, is titled, \\"Reaching your own verdict.\\" It includes passages that should be quoted directly: <br /> <br />*** <br /> <br />Perhaps I didn't address the objection that's uppermost in your mind. Fair enough. No single book can deal with every nuance. However, I trust that the amount of information reported in these pages will at least have convinced you that it's reasonable - in fact, imperative - to continue your investigation. <br /> <br />Pinpoint where you think the evidence needs to be bolstered and then seek out additional answers from well-respected scholars. <br /> <br />*** <br /> <br />So Strobel was not even suggesting that he wrote the be-all, end-all apologetics work. He was just, as Jim Morrison said about real poetry, \\"ticking off the possibilities.\\" <br /> <br />The content: While Strobel never comes out and says it, this book tends to be one long exploration of the \\"Lord, Lunatic, or Liar\\" argument. The argument is this: Jesus claimed to be God. Either he was indeed God (Lord), or he was a lunatic, or he was a liar. Critics point out that there are other alternatives, among them: that perhaps Jesus never claimed to be God, that perhaps his disciples misrepresented him. Strobel indeed attempts to deal with those criticisms, and that's where he starts, for the criticism that Jesus never claimed this is a criticism of the accuracy of the New Testament texts (i.e., that their authors misrepresented Jesus' words, deliberately or otherwise). <br />Part one is entitled \\"Examining the Record\\" and deals almost exclusively with questions of the New Testament's reliability, transmission, and canonization. None of the six chapters in this section go into tremendous detail, but rather offer an overview of textual criticism. <br /> <br />Part two deals with the character of Jesus as presented in the New Testament, particularly the four canonical gospels. It deals with whether Jesus actually claimed and understood himself to be God (as opposed to some liberal interpretations of the gospels), whether Jesus was mentally stable, and whether Jesus had the attributes of the expected Jewish Messiah. <br /> <br />Part three: the resurrection. Could Jesus have survived it and thereby faked his resurrection? Is there reason to believe Jesus' body was not in the tomb? Was Jesus really seen after his crucifixion? <br /> <br />Strobel doesn't spend much time on each issue, presumably because he didn't want to have a bloated book. He does provide short bibliographies at the end of each chapter, as well as a comprehensive bibliography at the end of the book. <br /> <br />Now for some specific criticisms of the content: First, much of the argument relies on reasoning that runs like this: \\"It's reasonable that x would have happened, so we can trust the account,\\" or its mirror, \\"It's not reasonable that the opposite of what the gospel claims would have happened, so we can trust the account.\\" Reasonable speculation, in other words. This is particularly evident in the chapters on whether or not Jesus' body was in the tomb (Who could have removed it? What would have been their motivation? That's about the best the argument gets.) and Jesus' post-crucifixion appearances. <br /> <br />Another problem I have with the book is with the issue of legend. One thing Strobel returns to is the question of whether or not there was enough time between Jesus' life and the writing of the gospels for legend to take hold and exaggerate some of the story. The argument that Strobel's experts continually offer is there was not enough time for legend to affect this, because there were people still living who'd witnessed it and could say that the gospels had it all wrong. But this assumes a few things: first, that there would have been people in a position to check up on the gospel writers. Most early Christians were not part of the Roman aristocracy who could wander over the Middle East to check out the facts. Second: that the gospels would have been widely known within the original witnesses' lifetimes. As we know from the history of canonization, many of the epistles were suspect because they were only locally known. (I believe Second Peter suffered from this suspicion.) Strobel, who's supposed to be pulling no punches and asking tough questions, never seems to consider these possibilities, let alone bring them up. <br /> <br />Lastly, much has been made if this book's one-sidedness. This doesn't bother me much, for it's clear from the title that such will be the situation. This is not \\"The Case of Christ\\" or \\"The Trial of Christ\\" or \\"Atheism versus Christ\\" but rather, \\"The Case FOR Christ.\\" There's a big difference there. Strobel is not try to present both sides of the issue. Indeed, how could he? There are other books that do that (Strobel mentions some of them in his bibliography, in fact), but they tend be written by two people: a believer and a non-believer. Imagine that. <br />	2004-09-06

That the book is published by an evangelical publishing house testifies to the fact that Waiss failed; that the book is not titled \\"Letters that Converted a Catholic Priest\\" testifies to the fact that McCarthy failed.<br />Who won the debate is more a question of readers' preconceptions than anything else. Catholics will be unconvinced by McCathy's arguments, and few Protestants will be moved by Waiss's somewhat bland presentation.<br />Of the two, McCarthy is much more aggressive, and in many ways, much more rational. But there is a mystical element in Catholicism that doesn't mix well with pure rationalism. Recall that after consecrating the host in Mass, priest speak of the \\"Great mystery of faith.\\"<br />At the heart of the book is the question of authority: both accept the Bible as an authority, but evangelicals stop there, where as Catholics see Tradition and the Church as on equal footing as the Bible, comprising together the Word of God. Much of the book, then, revolves around Waiss trying to show how the Church's extra-Biblical notions (i.e., those not specifically detailed in the Bible, such as the papacy, Mary's Immaculate Conception, etc.) are, in some way, Biblically based while McCarthy chips away at Waiss's arguments. The tables turn from time to time, especially discussing \\"sola scriptura,\\" but by and large, it's a game of \\"Prove it from the Bible.\\"<br />As such, McCarthy and Waiss toss one phrase (or a derivative) at each other quite often: \\"No where in the Bible do we find X.\\" McCarthy fills in the variable with Papal authority, Marian devotion, the importance of Tradition; Waiss replaces \\"X\\" with the notion of \\"sola scriptura,\\" the Trinity, and a couple of other ideas. With the exception of \\"sola scriptura,\\" Waiss's contention seems to be that McCarthy and evangelicals are essentially \\"guilty\\" (my term, not his) of the same thing they accuse Catholics of: incorporation of extra-Biblical doctrines. Waiss could have pushed McCarthy a bit harder on this point, I think, for he doesn't even mention a host of non-Biblical based notions that \\"sola scriptura\\" evangelicals accept: Sunday worship, non-observance of Jewish holidays (i.e., no where in the Bible does it explicitly say that followers of Jesus are to stop observing the Jewish festivals), Easter, and Christmas come to mind.<br />This shows the Protestant notion of wanting to have its theological cake and eat it, too. Protestantism accepts the early Church councils' decisions about the New Testament canon, the proper day of Christian assembly, the appropriateness of celebrating Jesus' birth and resurrection, but most denominations (especially evangelicals) are unwilling to accept the Catholic Church's continuing authority. This is one of the paradoxes of the Protestant movement, which necessarily implies that the Church started off correctly, but somewhere got tangled up in a mess of legalism and false belief. Sadly, questions like \\"At which point?\\" and \\"Why would God let such a thing happen despite his promise to the contrary?\\" aren't mention in the book. It leaves me feeling that Waiss pulled some of his punches.<br />On the other hand, McCarthy demolishes some Waiss's arguments in support of Catholic theology. His handling of whether Jesus had half-brothers (i.e., whether Mary remained a virgin her whole life and whether \\"brothers\\" in the New Testament should be translated \\"cousins,\\" as the Church maintains) is well done, for example.<br />As I mentioned earlier, who won the debate depends on readers' preconceptions. As a non-Christian skeptic, I found the debate to be a draw. This is because \\"Letters\\" is a debate about the tenants of a religion based on a self-contradictory book, a notion neither McCarthy nor Waiss would take into account. For example, is one saved by faith alone or by faith and works? It depends on where you look in the Bible. Did Saul/Paul's traveling companions on the road to Damascus hear a voice or not? It depends on which chapter of Acts you read. Does the bread and wine become Jesus' actual body? It depends on how you read a couple of different NT passages. With such a flawed starting position, a draw is the best outcome either participant could hope for. <br />When such contradictions arise, the great literal/figurative differentiation arises. Indeed, much of the book also seems to be an argument as to whether or not to interpret this or that passage literally or figurative, with each side accusing the other of taking the passage out of context.<br />On the other hand, it is refreshing to see debate that doesn't often (though sometimes, to a slight degree) slip into personal insults. While many Protestants (and this almost always includes fundamentalists, and often includes evangelicals) think the Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon and the Pope the Anti-Christ and many Catholics regard Protestants as heretics, McCarthy and ____ keep things civil the whole time.<br />One final criticism: the length precluded truly in-depth discussion, and many of McCarthy's and Waiss's comments go unanswered.<br />Overall, I would say it's an interesting read for the simple fact of seeing to opposing views clearly (though perhaps too succinctly) presented.	2004-07-15

But the, episodic narrative, while plain, is well written.<br />This book presents the story of a girl who endured unbelievable cruelty at the hands of her father, siblings, and most especially, stepmother, and yet grew up to be a kind and forgiving woman.<br />The enormity of Mah's stepmother's cruelty left me in shock at times. &quot;How could someone be that emotionally abusive?&quot; I thought. How could any child grow up to be a well-adjusted adult when she was forbidden to go to visit the few friends she had, or to invite them to her home; when she was dropped off at an orphanage as punishment for some triviality; when her rich parents suggested she go to a bank to get a loan so she could afford to buy a plane ticket to the States, where she had a job waiting for her. These are just a few of the many examples that come to mind as I type this. Mah 's stepmother was, in short, pathologically cruel.<br />And yet, as if to disprove all the nurture advocates in the nature/nurture debate, Mah grew up to be a forgiving, generous woman. As she reached financial security as an anesthesiologist, she used her money to help her siblings (and their children), though they'd done nothing but torment her for most of their lives.<br />&quot;Falling Leaves&quot; is a example of how good people are simply good people, no matter how society treats them, and that evil people can be unbelievably dark.	2004-07-13

The trip begins with a journey through France, then at war with England, followed by a passage through the Egyptian desert and, upon arrival on the Sub-continent, imprisonment by Hyder Ali, \\"Muslim ruler of Mysore and military commander who played an important part in the wars in southern India in the mid-18th century\\" (Hyder Ali. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 6, 2004, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service. <[...]>).<br />Her letters show clearly the eighteenth century English notion of \\"bringing culture to the savages.\\" Eliza wonders in genuine incomprehension at the thieving servants, failing even to acknowledge the fact that she and her fellow countrymen are occupiers and in place to except kindness from their subjects. She is shocked at Ali's gall to \\"treat _English_ subjects with such cruelty\\" (120, emphasis hers). Ironically, describing her maltreatment by an upper-class Englishwoman in India, she provides the perfect summary of her blindness: \\"Those basking in the lap of prosperity can little appreciate the sufferings or make allowance for the errors of the unfortunate; whom they regard as almost beings of another order\\" (175).<br />Yet we can hardly fault Eliza for simply reflecting the middle-class values of her society, and in fact there is much in this young lady to set her apart from her peers. She endures some genuine hardships with a cliché English \\"stiff upper lip,\\" and has the strength to deal with a less-than-ideal husband in a manner less than conventional in the eighteenth century.<br />Overall, it's not a book I'd recommend for \\"light,\\" easy reading. However, if you've read Forester's \\"Passage to India\\" or you want a look back at the beginnings of English colonization, then it's not a bad read.	2004-05-20

It is told from various points of view, by various characters, at various times, resulting in a book which on the surface might seem &quot;downright Faulknerian.&quot; However, Smith's main concern is the story and not the experience of reading it (which could, on some level, be said of Faulkner's literary goals), hence readings don't have to wrestle with the language. That being said, readers unfamiliar with the grammatical and lexical idiosyncracies of Appalachian English might sit scratching their heads at some of the characters' utterances, but the language is far from incomprehensible.<br />&quot;Oral History&quot; offers a view into a period and location that, until recent years, has remained fairly secluded.

Aside from descriptions of troop movements, officers' meetings, close-range combat, and all the other things you might except from a battle history, Beevor also intersperses it with material from interviews with survivors, as well as diary fragments and quotes from letters home. The result is a horrifying, in-depth view into what the battle was like for those fighting it, rather than an analysis of anonymous divisions.<br />I greatly appreciated the human face put on German soldiers. While never ceasing to condemn the brutality of the Nazi regime, \\"Stalingrad\\" also reminds us that a large proportion of the army (perhaps even the majority, though I know too little about history to say that - it's just the sense I get from the book) were not rabid, anti-Semitic Nazis (or even members of the party), but human soldiers - and all that implies. In other words, capable of suffering and inflicting suffering (both of which they did in great amounts), capable of giving and accepting mercy (both of which they did in amounts surprising to one accustomed to the all-Germans-evil-people view of WWII). <br />But the clearest thing I gleaned from this book was the utter perverse, double-edged miracle of it all: The first \\"miracle:\\" that Hitler's army's managed to defeat anything at all, considering Hitler's poor military strategies coupled with his obsession with controlling all troop movements from afar and his inability to take advice. The second: the defense of Stalingrad (and the Soviet Union in general), considering Stalin's overbearing impatience and the utter brutality of the Soviet regime. For example, early in the battle for Stalingrad, a secondary line of soldiers was positioned behind the front line, except these were security agency members, and their job was to shot (!?!?) anyone thought to be retreating, In the early weeks of the battle, Stalin provided Hitler with stiff competition for who could kill the most Soviet soldiers.<br />\\"War is hell\\" goes the cliché, and this book shows that, in this particular case especially, we can add to that: \\"War is [unbelievably stupid, unnecessary] hell.\\"	2004-04-19

Faulkner is not for everyone, and this book is exhibit number one. I read half of it a year ago before going back and starting over, determined to finish it. I am certainly glad I did, and I will say without doubt I will read it several more times in my life, for this book is at the same time one of the most difficult I've ever read, and one of the most rewarding.<br />First, the cons: vocabulary that continually drives you to a dictionary; long, run-on sentences, with digression piled on top of digression, parenthesis within parenthesis within parenthesis; multiple telling of the same story. The reading is not easy, in other words.<br />But the pros: Faulkner is a master of \\"showing, not telling.\\" He writes poetry without line breaks. For example:<br />** \\"a creature cloistered now by deliberate choice and still in the throes of enforced apprenticeship to, rather than voluntary or even acquiescent participation in, breathing\\"<br />** \\"battles lost not alone because of superior numbers and failing ammunition and stores, but because of generals who should not have been generals, who were generals not through training in contemporary methods or aptitude for learning them, but by the divine right to say 'Go there' conferred upon them by an absolute caste system.\\"<br />** \\"and maybe they never had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about wounds in the Confederate army in 1865 would be like coal miners talking about soot.\\"<br />From these three examples alone, one can see that it's unfair to say that Faulkner's book is one run-on sentence without any differentiation in style or voice. Instead, they show a mastery of language, which Faulkner admittedly gets a little carried away with from time to time, but generally uses much like we use our lungs - without seeming to think about it.<br />What is most striking about the book is the similarity it has to the human experience. Walter Allen said this is the book in which Faulkner \\"most profoundly and completely says what he has to say about . . . the human condition.\\" And what is that? That humans are weak and prone to lying, and more dangerously, prone to believing lies that are more comfortable than the truth. When we finish the book, we're still not sure about the details of the story. We don't know who twisted what in his/her narrative, and because the story is told from several points of view, we get conflicting interpretations from the characters about the meaning and cause of certain events. But as in real life, there's no omnipotent interpreter to sort everything out. Almost . . .<br />\\"AA\\" is particularly engrossing in the final half.

It then looks at concerte examples, with much attention paid to police batallions.<br />The actions of the police batallions is the closest the book comes to dealing with the question of what ordinary Germans (i.e., women, children, and those too old to be conscripted) knew about the Holocaust, other than a few passing references.<br />One thing it does not do, though it comes close, is paint all Germans as evil hate-mongers, as other reviews state.

The main thrust of the book is that, while everyone is entitled to his or her own view, a view that goes against established historical facts does not constitute &quot;the other side of the story.&quot;<br />An allegory as explanation: those who try to mount a scientific defense that the tooth fairy exists are not engaging in an effort to uncover &quot;the other side of the story.&quot; One is entitled to believe that said fairy exists, but the evidence strongly suggests (for lack of a better term) otherwise.<br />The one problem I have with the book is the attention Lipstadt draws to Noam Chomsky's assertion that, from a political point of view, it is possible for Holocaust figures to have been exaggerated to serve the end of establishing a secure Israeli state. His summary of this possibility is that to deny otherwise is to suggest that the Israeli state is the first state in history not to have lied to promote its own aims. I believe the fact that most states deceive and lie at some point in their history was the more important point for Chomsky, and not the possibility of inflated Holocaust figures.<br />That aside, the book is a good overview of revisionist history and the solid facts that show Holocaust denial to be a racist fantasy.	2004-04-14

For example, the Dead Sea scrolls were found in 1947, not in \\"the 1950's\\" as one of Brown's character's claims. Another example: One of Brown's characters says that in the non-canonical Gospel of Philip, Jesus refers to Mary Magdalene as his \\"companion,\\" which in the Aramaic language is synonymous with \\"wife.\\" The problem, though, is that the Gospel of Philip was not written in Aramaic but in Greek.

The title of the second chapter sums up this book: &quot;Relativizing the Relativizers.&quot; In other words, if Marx and Freuerbach turned Hegel on his head, here's an effort to do the same in turn to them. In other words, it deals with the issue of whether religion is a human projection. &quot;Yes,&quot; says Berger, &quot;But that doesn't necessarily invalidate it,&quot; he continues.<br />This is not some &quot;God-is-dead&quot; theological exercise, nor is it liberal, secular theology a la Harvey Cox's &quot;The Secular City.&quot; It does provide sociology's point of view on religion from a sociologist who is himself a believer. It takes seriously the threat posed to traditional dogma that sociology so forcefully poses, concedes its weaknesses, and yet doesn't conceded the fallacy and futility of religious belief.<br /> All this leads up to a pluralistic view of religion: fundamentalists and literalists beware.<br />Surprisingly, the best part of the book is when Berger switches hats and becomes a bit of a philosopher of religion. While he doesn't call them &quot;proofs,&quot; he does provide in the second half of the book &quot;signals&quot; that the divine exists.<br />This is one of my favorite books, and it has withstood the test of multiple reads through the years.	2004-01-08

Can one be a true, faithful adherent to multiple religions? These are some of the questions that get tossed around in this fable.<br />Two quotes seem best to summarize what was for me the most enchanting theme of this book: Some people \\"lack imagination and miss the better story.\\" And second: \\"If you stumble at mere believibility, what are you living for?\\"<br />This is one of the best books I've read in ages because it deals with one of my favorite obsessions -- the nature of belief -- without being at all preachy about it.<br />Is it a story good enough to make you belief in God, as the old man in the opening pages of the book claims?

Science is all that is objective and open to change and revolution; religion is all that is dogmatic and closed to change and resisting revolution. While this book has nothing directly to do with the science/religion issue, it nonetheless highlights facts that often sworn enemies are kissing cousins. The medical establishment's refusal to reevaluate the standards for dealing with infants born with ambiguous genitals despite overwhelming evidence that such a second-look is necessary can only be compared to the dogmatic instance of the church that Galileo was wrong, that evolution is a lie, that the Earth is the center of the universe. It shows that far from being objective, scientists can be just as ideologically hard-headed as the most fanatical religious believer.<br />However, that spotlight on medical dogmatism is, in some ways, a minor concern in this book, with the center of it being an incredibly tragic human story. In some ways, it's a triumphal story, as David is now living a productive, happy life. The tragedy returns, though, when one considers the fact that children with ambiguous genitals are still being treated in the same manner that virtually destroyed David and his family.<br />Also interesting is the question, raised later in the book, of the way manhood is equated with a \\"normal,\\" fully developed penis. As the Bruce/Brenda/David story shows, it takes much more than that to be a \\"man.\\"<br />Anyone interested in a concrete example of the nature/nurture question need look no further.	2003-12-27

Basic liberal Christian apology - an attempt to recast Christianity in a way that appeals to educated, liberal urbanites. It is, in his words, \\"verbal byplay in which . . . [he tries] to convince contemporary nontheists [and non-Christians in general] that the differences among men today over the reality of God are merely verbal\\" (259). Of course, he uses these words to criticize others' theology, not his own.<br />In essence, he says to the liberal, educated urbanite, \\"You're right: mankind has outgrown religion. But only as it has been cast in the past. In reality - i.e., in the way I cast it - that is the heart of true religion (read: Christianity). God is trying to get humans to abandon their unhealthy reliance on him and become 'true' humans.\\" In it, \\"the Gospel\\" becomes a euphemism for Christianity<br />To begin with, Cox recognizes that his audience is probably well educated, and even biblically literate. To that end, he must answer one question that plagues contemporary Christianity: how is it that the God we see in both the Old and New Testaments is so radically and concretely involved in human life compared to what we see today? In the Bible we have God parting the Red Sea and raising Jesus from the dead (which of course means nothing other than God raising himself from the dead, according to traditional theology); destroying complete cities with fire and brimstone from heaven and enabling people to walk on water. And yet he is curiously absent in our present reality. No donkeys are talking to anyone; no whales swallowing stubborn televangelists. There are no pillars of fire, no booming voices. What happened to God? Well, the problem, according to Cox, lies in the question itself. God is hidden, and \\"He cannot be expected to appear when we designate the place and time\\" (261). Very clever. The problem is that we're basically daring God to exist rather than looking \\"to the hints God has dropped in the past in order to make out what He is doing today\\" (254). The Bible, then, is just a collection of \\"hints\\" (not divinely inspired as such, and not infallible - a great relief to educated urbanites). In fact, God \\"does not 'appear' in Jesus; He hides himself in the stable of human history\\" (258). We just need to figure out where God is working and join him. This includes \\"standing in a picket line\\" (256) or, as implied on the back-cover biography of Cox, spending time in jail because for the cause of civil rights. In other words, he's saying, \\"Rest easy, liberal, educated urbanites. I'm not out to change your ultimate concern. I'm just trying to get you to frame it in a different way.\\"<br />In other words, he's saying, \\"We're not trying to convert the world to Christianity, so if that's one of your main obstacles to Christianity, you can go ahead and convert because it's not a legitimate concern.\\" It's liberal Christian apology, and nothing else. \\"Being Christian is basically being nice to others and helping them occasionally,\\" he seems to be saying. A comfortable, educated middle class liberal perspective. Get involved, but not too involved. You don't need to risk everything to be a Christian, because that removes responsibility from others.<br />But what about the exclusivist claims of Christianity? No problem, for if \\"we need the nontheists\\" then certainly we need others of other religious faiths. It's like trying to convert people without admitting that you want to convert everyone.<br />In the end, it's a theological version of having your cake and eating it too. The liberal, social activism and the comfort of Christian belief. \\"They're one and the same!\\" says Cox. It's sort of like suburban liberation theology.<br />By necessity, it's squishy theology - long on abstract notions, short on concrete specifics:<br />We speak of God to secular man by speaking about man, by talking about man as he is seen in the biblical perspective. Secular talk about God occurs only when we are away from the ghetto and out of costume, when we are participants in that political action by which He restores men to each other in mutual concern and responsibility (256).<br />Now we get a hint as to what this might mean from his picket line comment, but he's careful not to give too many specifics, lest he face the accusation of merely being a \\"liberal in Christian clothes.\\"<br />There are some good portions of the book. I was particularly pleased with the section dealing with Playboy magazine as a method of subversively dealing with (and consequently perpetuating) the male fear of sex that has arisen in our culture.<br />Other than that, silly nonsense.when we are participants in that political action by which He restores men to each other in mutual concern and responsibility (256).<br />Now we get a hint as to what this might mean from his picket line comment, but he's careful not to give too many specifics, lest he face the accusation of merely being a \\"liberal in Christian clothes.\\"<br />There are some good portions of the book.

It's a very human picture we get of an impressive man who has his own blindness (though \\"shortsightedness\\" would be a better description).<br />One thing that stands out is Wojty³a's desire for peace that sometimes leads to interesting contradictions. For example, his interfaith meetings and his desire to heal both the Orthodox/Catholic and the Anglican/Catholic rifts meet real trouble when people realize the Catholic church's stated goal is to convert everyone to Catholicism - \\"And he said to them, &quot;Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation\\" (Mark 16.15).<br />It also becomes clear that Wojty³a is an intellectual and sometimes has problems getting his ideas across so that simpletons (read: Reagan and Bush) can understand what he's driving at (i.e., that he's only advocating some portions of capitalism and not the brutal, unchecked Republican capitalism).<br />Lastly, as the book progresses it becomes increasingly obvious that Wojty³a is one of the rare types that, instead of becoming more and more liberal and tolerant as he grows older, becomes more and more stodgy and conservative.	2003-09-23

It rightly points out that there is a lot of criticism directed toward Christianity that, were it directed toward any other religion, would be construed as bigotry. That's true enough, and a fair criticism. On the other hand, the book seems to imply that the majority of contributions Christianity has made to civilization are positive - that the scales tip toward the good. That's fine and good, but it doesn't provide enough proof of that. We never get any idea if the people and groups in each chapter are exceptions to the rule, or the standard. I got the feeling that the authors didn't know either, but were trying to pass them off as the latter.<br />This is particularly noticeable when we consider the two topics conspicuously missing from the book: Christian anti-Semitism and Christian misogyny. The environment, democracy, and science all rightly get chapters, but nary a word about misogyny, and only lip-service to anti-Semitism (\\"Okay, okay, Luther was anti-Semitic, but look at all the good things he did!\\"). The closest thing to mentioning misogyny, on the other hand, is perhaps a reference to the (to use their woefully inadequate understatement) \\"unfortunate\\" Salem witch trials.<br />On the whole, I remain unconvinced of Christianity's virtues through the centuries. It's a human institution, filled with the hatred, bigotry, and stupidity common to all people.<br />Still, it did make me realize that condemning the Apostle Paul for his views on slavery is to use an anachronistic morality to judge him. This is a common theme in the book, and somewhat rightly so. We can't condemn society X for being cruel when it was no crueler than any other contemporary society, even if it is vastly more vicious than our own. We can comment on it, but it doesn't make them immoral.	2003-09-23

However, most of these objections are petty and insignificant, easily refuted and not anything a serious non-Christian would raise as an objection.<br />For example, he likes to use the Lord/Lunatic/Liar argument for the divinity of Jesus (see Book 2 Chapter 3). It goes as follows: Jesus claimed to be God. Either he was indeed God, or he was a lunatic for claiming it, or he was an outright liar. This argument is a non-argument for at least two reasons. As Lewis argues, \\"It seems obvious to me that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend\\" (Book 2 Chapter 4). It seems obvious to Lewis, but not to me.<br />To begin with, there are more than three possible explanations here. Perhaps he never did claim to be God. Or perhaps he was misquoted in the Gospels. On the other hand, we can't so easily dismiss the lunatic or liar possibility as Lewis likes to think. We have to remember that Jesus lied at least once. \\"'Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.' After saying this, he remained in Galilee. But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in private\\" (John 7.8-10 RSV). In addition, the lunatic label, while somewhat un-PC, might indeed fit, for Jesus once cursed a fig tree because it wasn?t bearing fruit, though it wasn't in season.<br />He also makes the bizarre argument in Book 2 Chapter 2 that Christianity is real because it's too bizarre to have been made up. In other words, it's true because it's weird. I guess that makes all science fiction stories true as well.<br />In arguing for basic theism, Lewis makes a little linguistic switch and then makes something out of it. He begins by using the word \\"law\\" descriptively (i.e., gravity) and the switches to a prescriptive use of \\"lawê (i.e., morality). He then makes much of this fact without acknowledging that that in fact is all he's done. It's a language trick, not in any way a proof of god.<br />Not only is Lewis book illogical, it is steeped in antiquated ideas. He subscribes to the idea of constant societal, moral progress (i.e., we as a society are becoming more and more morally enlightened) a la Comte even though this claim has widely been disputed by both historians and sociologists. He also shows an ignorance of basic sociology, and seems never to have read a single work of Durkheim (who could easily explain whence comes this internal ?moral law? that Lewis basis so much of his argument on).<br />A good example of his sociological ignorance comes when discussing the nature of Jesus? sacrifice in Book 2 Chapter 4. He makes the analogy that Jesus? sacrifice was not as much receiving punishment as paying a debt we all owe to God. That?s fine and good until we stop to think about what ?debt? is. In short, it is a societal construction. A debt is simply saying ?I owe you money.? What happens if we don?t pay it? According to nature, nothing. We won?t drop dead of a heart attack or break out in a rash. Instead, society allows the person owed to punish the debtor if the debt is not paid. One could easily imagine a society where there was no concept of debt. In this society, you can give money to your friend, but you cannot expect or even desire for the friend to pay it back.<br />Another example of antiquated ideas is his sexism. Describing the Christian marriage, Lewis says, ?There must be something unnatural about the rule of wives over husbands, because the wives themselves are half ashamed of it and despise the husbands whom they rule? (Book 3 Chapter 6). Not only is that a sexist statement, but, like most such statements, it is a sweeping generalization that presumes to see into the heart of thousands of women whom Lewis might describe as ruling over their husbands.<br />In short, Mere Christianity is a disappointment. It offers no new insight into Christianity and is in fact chock full of logical fallacies and ignorance. Any educated non-believer will remain unconvinced.	2002-08-07
