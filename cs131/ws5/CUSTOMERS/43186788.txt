After the crushing defeat inflicted on the Army of the Potomac, it is doubtful that the Union would have had the will to continue the fight.  As it was, many favored just chucking the war and letting the South go as late as the Fall of 1864.  Some historians argue that Sherman's March to Sea of September, 1864 was what saved Lincoln's Presidency from the \\"peace candidate\\" McClellan and thus the war effort itself. <br /> <br />I believe that all the South would have to do is last until the 1864 election and its independence would have been guaranteed. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book greatly, and it was well written.  Speaker Gingrich's opinion was well-presented and an enjoying read that I could not put down.  I much look forward to the third installment!	2004-12-09

It is so nice to get the other side of Jesse Jackson, his dark side, rather than the adulation of the Liberal Press.  People point out that Jesse Jackson has done some good.  True.  But then again, so did Al Capone and Adolf Hitler.  That didn't change them from being what they were- people guilty of terrible injustice.  So too is Jackson.  Timmerman's work is an excellent cataloguing of the things he has done and gotten away with.<BR>    The worst thing about Jackson was his connection to the El Rukn gang.  They were drug dealers and extortionists who manned the barricades of Jesse's early boycotts, using intimidation for those who did not want to play along.<BR>    Jesse's shakedowns of businesses that actually work for a living is old news for anyone- save for Liberals living in a permanent state of denial.  However the disasters he caused the people of African states like Sierra Leone, Liberia and South Africa were new to me (though hardly surprising).  A special thing to note is that Foday Sankoh, the murdering guerrilla leader that Jesse saved, helped finance 'al-Qaeda with the diamond mines he controlled.  Jesse helped bring about 9-11.<BR>    One of the saddest things is the treatment that Black Conservatives and Republicans receive at the hands of Black Democrats such as Jackson.  Timmerman basically wrote this book at the behest of Black Reverends(real Reverends who were properly ordained, unlike Jackson, who is no true man of God, either in terms of ordaination or in deed) who were afraid to speak out against Jackson for fear of retaliation.  If what Barbara Reynolds recived is any indication, they would perhaps have reason to fear for their lives.<BR>    Timmerman outlines the activities of Noah Robinson, the \\"Reverend\\"'s brother.  He is now serving life for murder.  His crimes are catalogued in the book.<BR>    I admire Timmerman's courage in writing this work, as his life may also be in danger, as was that of Ms Reynolds.  He is a patriot andwarrior for truth.  I wish to thank him for his research and dilligent pursuit of truth.  He deserves the thanks of the nation for exposing the activities of an unscrupulous man who is abusing the generousity of the American people.	2002-03-25

It was thoroughly well researched and documented and it will make your blood boil.<br />    Read about how Clinton abused his pardon and execuctive order priviledges.  Check into Hillary's 2000 Senate Campaign dealings.<br />    Barbara Olson will be much missed, may she rest with the angels.  She is dismissed as a right wing ideologue, but let's step back from that for a moment.  Barbara Olson uses well-documented resources and backs up her assertions with facts.  It has become too easy for the left to just say &quot;oh so-and-so is a right-wing chest-thumper&quot; and not have to adress their logic, nor make any attempt to refute their facts.  Looking at it in this manner, one cannot refute Mrs. Olson's well-documented logic.<br />    Everybody who is concerned about the fate of this country should read &quot;The Final Days.&quot;	2002-01-02

I have always known that such exists, but Goldberg gave details and insight that I never realized.  It took alot of courage, both moral and physical, for him to write this work.  He was attacked vitriolically for it, and the fiery darts have not yet abated.<br />    It will be hard for the Left to dismiss the McGovern/Mondale voting Goldberg as a member of the so-called &quot;Vast Right Wing Conspiracy&quot;, not that they won't try.<br />    It was obvious that this book was difficult for Goldberg to write, as the people at CBS News were his friends and co-workers of 28 years.  But he wrote this out of loyalty to a higher principle- that elementary principle of journalism I learned in a 7th grade clasroom- that of objective journalism.<br />    For years the major networks of ABC, NBC and CBS have been giving us Left-slanted news and most of the viewing public is well aware of this.  He repeatedly cites a &quot;Brill's Content&quot; Poll in which 74% of Republicans say most journalists are more Liberal than them(no surprise) and that 47% of Democrats surveyed say the same thing(shocking, eh?).<br />    I am glad that I am not the only human being in the world that noticed that all the stories about homelessness seemed to disappear upon the inauguration of Bill Clinton.  Goldberg dedicates a chapter to this issue and describes how the media, along with homeless advocates, inflated homelessness figures between ten and twenty times their actual amount.  What happened to the &quot;5 Million&quot; homeless(actual number between 250,000 and 600,000) after 1992?  We never heard about them again.<br />    Goldberg also has chapters on how the media pander to the whims of Feminists, Homosexual Activists, AIDS activists and others.<br />    The book is well written and very readable.  Goldberg is very well-informed on his subject matter.&quot;Bias&quot; is a must-read.	2001-12-26

Bill O'Reilly asks all the tough questions that the Lily-Livered Liberal Media are afraid to ask.<BR>    Bill O'Reilly was nothing short of a true hero to take on the extortionist tactics of Jesse Jackson's criminal empire, but a true gem was the interview with Dan Rather.  O'Reilly asked Rather if he thought Bill Clinton was an honest man.  Rather said yes and went on to say that someone could lie about any number of things and still be an honest man.  WOW!!  That's right up there with &quot;what the meaning of 'is' is.&quot;<BR>    O'Reilly has been falsely accused of being a Conservative talking head by Liberals who believe all their foibles are caused by a mysterious and elusive Right Wing Conspiracy.  But would a Conservative lackey with no independent thought take on a veritable pantheon of Republican leadership- George W Bush, Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich, George Pataki and others?  He has, making obvious the lie that he is some two-bit pundit.<BR>    Bill O'Reilly is a free-thinking, freedom loving man who has the courage to ask the tough questions.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a fair and balanced and well thought out political debate.	2001-11-27

Its main purpose was to prepare you for the 2000 election and what we'd be getting if Al Gore won the presidential election.  As I was reading it, however, Gore has tentatively hinted another run in '04.  Bearing that in mind, I still think this book is informative and necessary to all who might consider voting for Gore and any who might still wish he became the president last election.<BR>    Many had imagined Gore to be the better half of the Clinton/Gore team.  He certainly projected that wholesome image that Clinton could never pull off.  However, this book looks beneath his veneer of respectability and exposes his shady land dealing and utter hypocrisy when it comes to the environment.<BR>    As it says in the forward, Bossie and Brown strive to be as accurate as is humanly possible.

One by one, without malice or prejudice he exposes the lies that are collectively called multiculturalism. How would you feel if you knew a group of gay activists disrupted a church service by throwing condoms during the breaking of bread? It happened. Do you really know what your kids are learning in their schools and universities? Dr Schmidt's book is a wake up call for all parents to take a bigger role in the education of their young children and older children too. Many outrageous classes are being offered at once distinguished universities which have now become Liberal indoctrination centers. Everybody concerned with education in this country needs to read this book. People who hate America are slowly turning our people against each other.	2001-08-26

Through their eyes we watch the chaotic and destructive era of 1914-1945. The two brothers, Peter and Pauli were allegorical of the German people themselves. Pauli as a young boy fights in the trenches of the Western Front, he is unready, but he goes anyway and gives his all. Peter flies dirigibles for the Kaiser's Navy. Both are horribly scarred by the war and this affects their postwar and WWII lives.<br />The backdrop of the Berlin that Peter and Pauli live in is very rich in detail. Deighton seems to have an excellent understanding of German history and culture. He gives us a whirlwind tour of the suffering in the postwar economy, taking us right into the '30s. Deighton gives a human face to the Gray ranks of the Germans of World War II. Speaking of which, we see the humanity of his characters, as none are black and white, all falling into shades of gray. I read this book months ago, and I still sometimes ponder on the great good and the great evil within Pauli. I do highly recommend this book. It is a great literary work.	2001-08-24

I enjoyed it greatly.  However, it did not grip me and not let me put the book down, the way the Greatwar Series(of which this is a prequel) did.  However, let me not be a nay-sayer.  This book is an absolutly necessary companion to the Greatwar Series.          I greatly enjoy the way Harry Turtledove alters the lives of great Americans of the Civil War Era by changing the outcome of the Civil War.  Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Mark Twain(known only in this work by his real name of Sam Clemens), Old Peete Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson and others.<br />Also, I find this book a great improvement on &quot;Guns of the South&quot; (I loved &quot;Guns&quot;, dont get me wrong) because, as Dr Turtledove puts it, the Civil War outcome is altered by &quot;natural causes&quot; rather than time travellers.<br />As an entire series, Greatwar deserves six stars.  It is premier fiction of the first rate.  reading alternate history gives one an appreciation of real history, because we have a way of being what I call &quot;temperocentric&quot;.  That is, we believe that every moment before our own time existed solely to lead us up to this moment and that history could not have possibly gone any other way than it did.  Alternate history as a whole is more than just an interesting diversion.  It is a great teaching tool, or it could be.  And Dr Turtledove writes the best, bar none.	2001-08-19

I began reading it as I was shipping out for an Army exercise.  My girlfriend had broken up with me the night before and I was in low morale, to say the least.  I read this book before going out into the field, and it raised my morale very high.  I felt Leonidas and Dieniekes watching me from Elysium as I trained, and I won a medal for my performance.<br />We owe so much to King Leonidas and his valiant warriors.  Democracy would surely have died at the hands of the absolutist Persian regime.<br />Pressfeld brings to life the Spartan culture and the true love they had for their country and for each other.  History generally portrays the Spartans as ignorant fascists, and that is what they wanted you to think.  Pressfeld explores the cult of Phobos, fear.  The Spartans wanted you to think they were pitiless fiends who loved to beat their children.  It made people fear them.  And they knew that half the battle was lost already if the enemy feared.  Pressfeld pulls away the mask of fear in which Sparta is buried.  He shows the humanity of the Spartans.  This book is a must read for anyone who is a true warrior and anyone who loves democracy.  Bravo, Pressfeld, they should have made this book, and not Bagger Vance, into a movie.	2001-08-18

The Liberals were riding high, the lies they told in the media had stupefied so many back then.  I really thought America was going to go down the tubes.  That was when I found Rush and his works.  He gave me hope, hope that America was not over, as Bill Clinton's election seemed to portend.    <br /> Liberal magpies constantly sqwawk about how Rush tells us what to think.  That is so untrue, like most of what they believe.  One of my favorite things about Rush is that he often speaks what's on my mind, as though he plucked it from my head.  Many Conservatives claim this.  He was a voice for those who had none at CNN or CBS or much of anywhere in the media.  I am ecstatic that now things have come full circle and that the CNN who once mocked him, now comes to him hat in hand.  It is justice that is poetic.	2001-08-18

He demonstrates beyond a doubt the existence of the Liberal bias in the media and how it nearly cost George W Bush, the rightful president, the election.     If you are at all concerned about our Great Republic, you need to read this book and the factual analysis it contains.  When you put the book down, you'll say whew! were we lucky last Fall!  God was with us.	2001-07-10
