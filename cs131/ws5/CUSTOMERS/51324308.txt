US	51324308	R3HIRM6JHE3DOI	0312994834	724784491	The Distant Echo	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Twisty Cold Case	A lovely book taking you to the backwaters of Scotland. I enjoyed this story. Not hard to read but not gripping either. This is a Cold Case gone wrong with deadly results. The story is a scary reality jolt (at least for me) that this could happen to anybody who is innocent and trying to do the right thing. Also makes you wonder who you can really trust. The story is not too complex but clever enough to keep you guessing pretty much to the end. Val McDermid is a very good writer who is worth reading again.	2005-07-27

This superb story will keep you reading to the last. What makes this book so special is that it is not your standard crime novel with the police seen as always the good guys. It is obsessive until the end and you will really wonder where it is leading you. Love crime read this one.	2005-01-17

This is a great soap opera sprawling a number of generations from the 1800's to the changing times of the 1920's & 30's. Through this novel we can see the changes that took place in society where money was no object. There is love, lust, adultery, death, birth and friendship. We find in this novel that those with money during this early times were not suffering with the problems of monetary poverty but that of emotional poverty. There are standards to uphold and mistakes are made and status can suffer. <br /> <br />You will love this novel, it is a classic and certainly better than any mini series.	2004-10-01

This book lightens the load of sadness to a certain degree when we are left to contend with our loss. I thought it was a lovely story though very sad in places it was also filled with love, fun and memories of life. The book provides a lovely way of looking at death and the loss we feel - a fantasy that you may wish to hold close.

Ellis has crept inside the mind of a physcopath in a very realistic way. He graphically portrays each black scene that will leave you shaking. I recommend this book for those who are interested in the minds of the mentally unstable who create sad and black crimes. I don't recommend it if you are nauseated to the bone by highly descriptive scences of death and debauchery.	2002-01-16

Unfortunately for me it is not a practical one. Sure if I changed my life around completely I would be able to follow the guidelines of the book - but who can do that when they have to earn a living?<br />If you are retired or without any permanent committments then Deepak's book may just work for you.

Interview with the Vampire is sinister, compelling and intriguing. The only thing was toward the end I found my concentration waivering a bit. I have read this book twice and it has been the same each time. I think some areas ramble a little too long. Still it is a great read and I recommend it highly.	2002-01-15

It is excellent at showing you how to create the books (and using other functions) but it does not explain how they work.	2002-01-15
