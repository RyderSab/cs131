As good as his writing is, and as gripping the situations he describes, what earns this book 5 stars is the way Salter's images persist in the mind.  They are so crisp and seem so right that you can't shake them.  I'll never fly an F-86, but I think I've got a good idea what the view from up there would have been like.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-07-25

After my daughter fell in love with Zelinsky's wonderful \\"Wheels on the Bus\\", we had to get her this one.  She adores it, and will choose it most of the time we ask her to get a book.  However, unlike \\"Wheels\\", the mechanisms are too delicate for a toddler.  This morning she yanked on one of the tabs, and although nothing tore, one of the little men will no longer go back into his hiding place.  The damage appears permanent.<br /><br />Highly recommended either for slightly older children or those who will be content to let their parents pull all the tabs for them.	2005-05-16

Anderson was a pillar of science fiction from the late 1950s into the 1990s, and the Flandry books--part of the larger Technic future history that includes the van Rijn/Falkayn series--were from his strongest period. <br /> <br />I read these stories as a kid and later as an adult and was impressed by how they grew with me--lots of bold adventure, but some serious musings, as well.  Flandry is a very modern character, in some respects, with sophisticted tastes and inner conflicts, but also very much a man of his corrupt and decadent time. <br /> <br />If iBooks perseveres with this series, then the best Flandry book--and one of Anderson's best--should be out soon, \\"A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows.\\"	2005-05-14

I'm glad I waited. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have commented on the differences between the first and second halves of the novel.  Not only are they stylistic, but the scope of the story widens dramatically in part 2.  Here's where reading NWP out of order helped, though, because the other novels created a context that made the dramatic shifts more understandable than they might have been otherwise. <br /> <br />Without giving any spoilers, all of Roberts' usual themes are here, including betrayal, corruption, and a fairly cynical attitude towards women.     <br /> <br />All in all, great, thrilling stuff, of a type that isn't really done any longer.  Enjoy.	2005-04-14

After reading the latest installment in Kage Baker's \\"Company\\" series, I'm torn between wanting the next volume to wrap things up and fearing it will do just that.  The premise of these novels and the excellent short stories that have accompanied them is quite clever, and Ms. Baker has a large enough canvas to keep working this material for decades.   <br /> <br />However, I'm not sure that this chapter is quite as self-sufficient as an earlier reader suggests.  While starting here would be less confusing for someone new to Baker than the previous, much darker novel, I'd still recommend reading at least \\"In The Garden of Iden\\" and \\"Mendoza in Hollywood\\" first, if you can find them.  They are essential to understanding the relationship between Mendoza and Alec, while \\"Sky Coyote\\" and \\"Graveyard Game\\" focus primarily on Mendoza's cyborg colleagues.  <br /> <br />I don't think I'm overstating the case to suggest that Baker is simply the best new science fiction writer to hit the field in at least a decade.  She has reawakened my interest in the genre, when it was drowning in a sea of fantasy and military sf-clones.  Great stuff!	2005-02-26

The story itself is riveting, with overwhelming historical significance.  How different would our world be, had the Norman invasion met a Saxon army that was rested and up to strength? We know the outcome, so the suspense must derive from our concern for individual characters.  This is the novel's strength and weakness: intriguing portraits of the doomed Harold and an admirable hero, the housecarl Ranulf, are diminished by sideplots involving characters that seemed either too modern or entirely irrelevant. <br /> <br />While I enjoyed the book, Housecarl would have benefited from better editing, not to mention decent proofreading and typesetting.  There was hardly a page that didn't contain a typo, missing indentation or line space, or some grammatical glitch.  Mr. Brown deserves a better publisher next time around.	2005-02-02

Tor Books deserves kudos for bringing this collection of classic novellas from sf's Golden Age back into print, and in hardcover, too, with Volume 2B presumably still to come.   <br /> <br />The novella, longer than a short story, shorter than a full novel, is the ideal length for science fiction, providing enough room for an author to present an idea and work through all its implications, without the padding that often seems obligatory for marketing purposes today.   <br /> <br />This book includes key works by some of the field's biggest names from the 1940s and 50s.  Most will probably be new to anyone who started reading science fiction after the 1980s, including Campbell's \\"Who Goes There\\", filmed twice as \\"The Thing\\" but much creepier in print, and Lester del Rey's \\"Nerves\\", which pre-dated Three Mile Island and Chernobyl by decades.   <br /> <br />While the science may have dated, these are still terrific stories.	2005-01-21

I almost gave up early on, as the plot developed rather slowly and episodically.  However, my patience was rewarded when Sabatini turned this novel on its head several times on its way to a very satisfying conclusion.  Nearly every detail in the first half proved critical to understanding what transpired in the second, and I found myself referring back frequently and smiling at how neatly the author had set things up.   <br /> <br />One word of caution: Sabatini was a bestseller in the nineteen teens and twenties, and his style seems a bit convoluted and dated, today.  Stick with it, and the story and fascinating characters will repay you, and you may even add to your vocabulary along the way. <br /> <br />	2004-12-13

This novel picks up Inspector Troy's career at an earlier stage, during WW II, but before the action of \\"Black Out\\".  Though Troy doesn't get center stage, this is still an excellent story, with its fascinating picture of early 1940s London and the last few months before its two biggest players, the US and USSR, entered the war.   <br /> <br />Recommended, in spite of a couple of others here thinking that a prior UK publication is grounds to knock a perfectly good novel.	2004-10-27

Rather, I was drawn into it by its fascinating picture of imperial decay and a sense of what life in Roman Germany might have been like.

In contrast, &quot;The Wreck of the River of Stars&quot; is a grand reminder of why science fiction once comprised most of my pleasure reading.  It has that combination of solid writing, interesting characters, and ideas worth contemplating after the story is done, and more.<br />As others have indicated, Flynn was channeling Heinlein when he wrote this novel, and that doesn't detract from Flynn's own style.  An example of this is the masterful way he gives his world a vivid past that is still in our future, not through the &quot;infodumps&quot; of less polished writers (think Dan Brown), but through casual references interspersed in the characters' conversations.  <br />Fans of Patrick O'Brian may also come away from River thinking that Mr. Flynn has spent more than a few hours in the company of Jack Aubrey and co., from the way he evokes the terminology of an earlier age of sail.<br />This excellent novel deserves all the accolades it has received.	2004-06-22

While it can't quite compete with Benford's Galactic Center series, the gold standard of literate hard sf, it has the great virtue of not making the reader wait ten years for all the volumes to appear.  <br />The chief deficiencies arise not from poor writing, but from one of the central premises, that of the multiply replicated &quot;engrams&quot;.  This made it difficult to keep the large cast of characters straight.  While I found them believable enough, I often had a hard time rooting for them.<br />But these are quibbles compared to the pleasures this series offers.  And while most of the recent crop of sf has inspired only my indifference, I devoured each of these novels as it came out and couldn't wait for the next.	2004-01-22

I expect &quot;Blind Lake&quot; to linger on, too.  <br />I'm not sure &quot;Blind Lake&quot; is quite up to its predecessor's 5 stars, so call it 4 1/2.	2003-09-27

While not as epic as either of its precursors, Lively Lady illuminates a little-known episode of this country's history, when our war against Britain in 1812 (in effect a side-action of the Napoleonic Wars) was conducted at sea largely by private vessels licensed by our fledgling government to attack, capture, and destroy Britain's ocean-going commerce.<br />Roberts can come across as a bit stodgy and old-fashioned--and certainly not &quot;politically correct&quot;--to modern readers, but if you make allowances for his writing reflecting his times, you'll be richly rewarded with fascinating details and great storytelling.	2002-06-20

Although at first I was surprised that Rhodes devoted so many pages to covering Soviet espionage on the Manhattan Project and subsequent atomic bomb work, it quickly became clear that he was writing a history not just of the H-bomb, but of the Cold War, its impetus, and one of its key drivers and manifestations, the arms race.  <br />This book is essential to understanding a critical period of world history that is no less relevant now that the Cold War is over.  The picture this provides of the scientists and administrators of the weapons teams on both sides is fascinating and reveals new evidence and clearer perspectives on issues that many of us grew up thinking about, such as the trial of the Rosenbergs and the effort to tar Oppenheimer's reputation.<br />The only area in which I found myself seriously questioning Rhodes's conclusions (perhaps unfairly, since 7 years and some key events have transpired since he wrote them), was in the area of nuclear terrorism and its deterrence.  <br />An engrossing read.	2002-03-22

The visit to the Czech fortress is haunting, as much for the way it is set up and described, as for the realization it creates of just how many opportunities the West missed to stop Hitler in his tracks before 1939.  <br />Can't wait to see Furst's next effort.	2002-01-17

I was drawn to this novel both by my great enjoyment of Collins's &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and its characters, as well as a long interest in the art of J.M.W. Turner.  The novel is atmospheric, suspenseful, and fascinating.  If I had stopped reading prior to reaching the resolution that Wilson creates for the mystery of Turner's life that turns into an obsession for Walter Hartright, I'd have been tempted to give this book 4 or even 5 stars.  But the events of the final chapters left me feeling betrayed and literally turned my stomach.  <br />Perhaps it is naive of me to think that, when an author employs characters created by another--particularly from an acknowledged classic--he owes them a certain degree of respect.  I see little appeal in deliberately degrading them or making them depraved, regardless of how logically the case for this is built up.  <br />For a more pleasant, lighthearted novel reviving classic characters, the reader might try Jasper Fforde's &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot;, instead.	2002-01-17

His thrillers (like his earlier science fiction) always strike a nice balance between fascinating tech and quirky, interesting characters.  What I've loved about his books since the first one I read is that I always come away not only entertained, but also informed about something worth knowing.  (One of his early books turned me on to NPR.)  This novel is also much less dark than some of his recent work, with moments of genuine humor.  At one point I became so engrossed that I had to switch to another book at bedtime in order to be able to fall asleep.	2001-09-24

I had read it when it first came out and again a few years later, and its message has stuck with me.  Although the brand of terrorism Ing was writing about--rooted in the hijackings and bombings of the 70s--may seem sadly outdated, his thinking on the subject and how a nation responds is all too relevant now.  Highly recommended, along with most of his other work.	2001-09-15

I'd seen references to it for years, but never actually saw the book.  I finally acquired it several years back, though it sat on my shelf until last week.  I had put off reading it, because I was afraid it might disappoint, compared to favorites like &quot;Lord Kalvan&quot;, or that it would seem terribly dated.  I needn't have worried.  The writing was crisp, the characters interesting, and the gun lore fascinating.  In short, it has held up as well as many other books from the '50s that are still popular, such as Stout's Nero Wolfe. It's a shame Piper didn't live to publish the sequel or to explore the mystery genre further. <br />The Old Earth edition included interesting biographical and bibliographical info on Piper, and it was nicely printed on good quality paper.	2001-07-08
