I appreciate the innovation of writing a book about comics in comic-book style.  It's a clever, winning idea.  Perhaps it would have worked a bit  better if McCloud himself were a better draftsman, or if there had been  more (and better-quality) reproductions of other artists' work.<br />The  writing here is uneven.  Some chapters, including &quot;Blood in the  gutter&quot; and &quot;Time Frames,&quot; are very effective and very  specific, with strong insights into the nuts-and-bolts of comic techniques.   Another chapter, &quot;The Vocabulary of Comics&quot; -- which uses a big  triangle graph to encompass the whole of range of comics art -- is quite  insightful but, at the same time, oversimplifies a bit, I fear.  I'm not  saying McCloud's assertions aren't necessarily true, but he might have put  himself on surer ground with some of the language/symbol ideas by getting  more heavily into semiotics theory, etc.  And maybe here is where the  light-hearted tone and comic-book style starts to undercut his intellectual  accomplishment.  I understand the book isn't meant to be a doctoral thesis,  but still, it has high ambitions, and the structure of the book must be  subordinated to the loftiness of its aspirations.  Chapter 7, which  attempts to relate all of artistic achievement into a unified whole, is one  of the least satisfying, because it is frankly pretentious and rather  gooey, non-specific, in its assertions.<br />Don't get me wrong.  There is a  lot of good insight in &quot;Understanding Comics,&quot; and I wouldn't  debate that it's an essential read for anyone interested in the topic.  But  it also feels like sort of a primer, a survey.  Each one of the chapters  could itself be the subject of a whole book.  In other words,  &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; has impressive breadth but not as much  depth as one might want.	2000-08-17

There's just something so open and exciting about this book -- the exotic locale, the breathless adventure and palpable danger, the complex political  scenario.  First-rate stuff, marred, alas, by a patronizing portrayal of  black Muslims being sold into slavery.  It's racist, but at any rate  considerably less so than &quot;Tintin in the Congo.&quot;	2000-07-27

It's interesting how archaic Spenser's language seems, considering that he was a contemporary of the much more modern-sounding Shakespeare.  Of course, there is a deliberately nostalgic  tone to the &quot;Fairie Queene,&quot; which harkens back to an idealized  medieval past.  The influence of Middle English poetry -- particularly  Chaucer and &quot;Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight&quot; -- is  palpable.<br />I shall try it again in time.  The lushness of Spenser's  language is at times delightful, and it's also illuminating to see the way  pagan and Christian imagery vie for power in the narrative.  The structure  seems a bit rambling; compared to the precision of (for instance)  &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; &quot;The Fairie Queene&quot; requires rather  more patience of the reader.	2000-07-25

Sagan rightly deplores efforts by mainstream scientists to suppress Velikovsky, both because they were dishonest, and  because (as noted by another reviewer) they made Velikovsky a martyr when  he might otherwise just have been forgotten.  Sagan's dissection of  Velikovsky's thesis is painfully specific, precise, methodical,  exhaustively researched, utterly polite, and totally relentless.  This is  the way to take on pseudo-science: with not a trace of snobbery or  arrogance, but with simple, devastating logic.	2000-07-16

In the final pages of &quot;The  Time Machine&quot; he gave us one of the great apocalyptic visions in all  of literature.  In &quot;The First Men in the Moon,&quot; he gives us a  magnificently alien setting, full of bizarre moments -- jumping about the  lunar surface in 1/6 G; the Giddy Bridge and the Fight in the Cave of the  Moon-Butchers; the bizarre lunar ecology, in which all the plants die every  night and are reborn each dawn.<br />Scientifically, much of this stuff  doesn't hold up after a hundred years.  And the device he comes up with to  get his characters to the moon -- Cavorite -- is without basis, an  arbitrary magical tool not unlike the time machine.  Even when Wells'  science is iffy, though, he presents it in such a clear, convincing fashion  that you are only too glad to suspend disbelief while the story  unfolds.<br />In the Selenites we have a metaphor for a different type of  society -- rigidly hierarchical, with the needs of the individual  sublimated to the whole.  The metaphor obviously comes from social insects;  though it became a sci-fi cliche, it was still fresh circa 1901.  In the  remarkable last section of the book (Cavor's communications from the moon),  Wells describes the Selenite society with delightful attention to detail.   He ends with a haunting, unforgettable image, and probably the best closing  sentence of any sci-fi novel.	2000-07-03

Strangely, as I read this book (and others), I  came to want the Oxfordian hypothesis to be true.  Perhaps I was just  swayed by the romance of it -- de Vere is such a dramatic character, and  one is compelled by the idea that he could have been the mysterious  author.<br />On reflection, I think we must for now remain with the  Stratfordian hypothesis.  My reason is as follows: two discrete bits of  contemporary evidence (the monument in Stratford and the &quot;Sweet swan  of Avon/Thy Stratford moniment&quot; phrases in the First Folio prefatory  poem) tell us that the historical record definitely claims Stratford  Shakspere was the guy.  Thus, to accept Oxford authorship we must assume a  cover-up of some kind.  Ogburn accepts this, but I don't think the evidence  on behalf of the Oxfordian hypothesis is yet sufficient to overturn what  the historical record seems to indicate.  There is compelling  circumstantial evidence -- such as underlined passages in de Vere's bible,  the similarities between early de Vere poetry and Shakespeare's later  style, and the remarkable biographical information that makes de Vere a  veritable template for Hamlet (the satire of Lord Burghley, the similarity  with Hamlet's relationship to Polonius, etc.).  This circumstantial  evidence is, I think, sufficient to keep the Oxfordian fires burning for  now, and justifies further research; but something stronger is needed to  reverse the claims of the First Folio and the Stratford monument.	2000-07-03

I didn't like &quot;Baby-Sat&quot; much when I first read it (compared to previous  collections, I mean) but it has since grown on me.  Watterson's art hits  its stride here -- it is smooth and polished, without the occasionally  pretentious formal experimentations of the later books (not that those are  all bad, but they grate sometimes).  There are some classic cartoons in  this collection -- I think the &quot;Chocolate Frosted Sugar-Bombs  beanie&quot; story is one of the very best.  Look at the way Calvin keeps  getting his hopes up, over and over again, only to have them dashed -- and  yet there is a kind of solace at the end.  This is as funny, sad and wise  as the best of &quot;Peanuts.&quot;	2000-07-03

This sort of comment  belittles scientific thought and tries to collapse it into the same sphere  as religious thought. <br />Dawkins himself has had much to say on the  question of whether science is &quot;just another religion,&quot; and this  &quot;faith&quot; business is just a way of rephrasing the accusation.  It  muddles Dawkins' point, which is this: if we can reasonably explain the  origins of life given the laws we know to exist, such an explanation, even  if impossible to definitively prove, is preferable to an explanation that  relies on the supernatural, because the latter is (in Dawkin's words)  simply rephrasing the problem.  I think this is an excellent distinction;  to say that, for instance, evolution and Special Creation both require  &quot;faith&quot; because neither is 100% proved, is dangerous sophistry of  the worst kind.  Though neither is absolutely proved, one is a reasonable  supposition, and the other is not.<br />Dawkins' point is to render God  tautological -- at least with regard to biological questions (he bows out  of cosmological discussions, claiming that is not his area of expertise).   Whether Dawkins succeeds completely in his aim in &quot;The Blind  Watchmaker&quot; can be debated -- I think he skirts a bit too quickly  around some of the questions of probability, particularly the issue of  whether, even allowing for accumulation of small change, the frequency of  beneficial genetic mutations is sufficient to give natural selection the  raw stuff it needs to work with.<br />&quot;Blind Watchmaker&quot; is a good  introduction, both to the theory of evolution in general, and to Dawkins'  refreshingly unapologetic, strident manner of writing.  But much more  reading must be done by anyone who wants to grasp all the issues  encompassed byevolution.	2000-06-28
US	50693245	R3SKCEBARGIXWM	0451524497	289712823	Anna Karenina (A Signet Classic)	Books	5	24	27	N	N	Quite simply, The Novel	&quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is why the novel was invented.  It is a colossal achievement that fully exploits the possibilities inherent in the literary form.  The purpose of the 19th-century novel was to explore character and  to critique society, and Tolstoy here has achieved the quintessence of both  aims.  The thing about Tolstoy is that you can trust him -- he is utterly  honest.  He doesn't revise, or simplify, or sugar-coat.  He presents the  human mind, in its various guises, precisely as it is.  Levin, to my mind,  rivals Hamlet as the most vivid, fully living character in literature, and  he is probably much more self-consistent than the Melancholy Dane.  Anna's  story, which is more melodramatic and plot-heavy, might strike some as a  flaw in comparison to Levin's.  And maybe it is a flaw.  But one must talk  about flaws in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; as one talks about flaws in  Beethoven's 9th Symphony -- blemishes on a masterpiece which, if it errs,  errs only in striving further than the art form is supposed to  go.<br />Tolstoy's genius at depicting character and psychology is matched by  his ability to construct vivid, memorable setpieces.  No one who has read  &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; can ever forget the hay-mowing, or Vronksy's  horse race, or the heartbreaking scenes of Levin's sickly brother.<br />Even  Dickens, with all his glorious phantasmagoria, never achieved what Tolstoy  has done here.  Tolstoy caught lightning in a bottle: homo sapiens,  captured in 800-odd pages.  There are only a handful of comparable  achievements in all of Western art.	2000-06-16

Clearly here was a crafted that had been years in the honing, and I appreciate the book's  liberation from the plot-heavy mechanics of earlier books like &quot;The  Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;The American.&quot;  Everything is only  subtly insinuated; whole lives can hinge upon half-meant gestures or  long-buried social prejudices.  In this way, the book has some of the  wistful tone of &quot;The Age of Innocence,&quot; but more depth if less  elegant prose.<br />The prose is the thing -- James was dictating by this time  (how on Earth does one dictate a novel?), and it shows.  His chewy  ruminations and meandering, endlessly parenthetical sentences are hard to  digest.  I think James went too far in his late style, and &quot;The  Ambassadors&quot; might have benefited from a sterner editor.  Still, this  is an important book, absolutely worth the read.	2000-06-16

Chopin at 17 was a wide-eyed kid from Warsaw with unparalleled musical  talent and his whole life in front of him, the world apparently his oyster.   To read his letters in subsequent years -- after the Russian invasion of  Poland that stranded him in Paris; the abortive betrothal to Maria  Wodzinska; the complex and finally tragic relationship with George Sand --  is to watch a man reach adulthood step by step.  Though they contain only  small, tantalizing glimpses of Chopin's opinions on music, the letters make  for an effective counterpoint to his immortal compositions.  The man who  wrote the great Ballades and Scherzi was just a man like any other: he was  annoyed at lazy servants, he unconsciously exploited his friends, he wanted  to move in the circles of great aristocrats, he had provincial and  prejudiced opinions.  The lesson is banal, but true, and vividly made clear  in these letters.	2000-06-15

Other books (Tad Szulc's Chopin in Paris,  for instance) might give a better impression of Chopin's daily life, but  this book does a fine job of relating the life to the music.  The  musicological passages are fairly sophisticated -- a grounding in music  theory is assumed -- but if you have such a grounding, there are fine  insights to be found here.  I was most pleased, for instance, to note that  Sampson had observed the similarities between the Nocturne in F (Opus 15  #1) and the Ballade #2 in A Minor, something I had long been aware of but  had not seen addressed in Chopin criticism.<br />Samson's examination of genre  is illuminating too -- he tries to perceive Chopin's music not as an  absolute frozen in amber, but rather from the perspective of its own time,  an era full of contrasting and overlapping genre conventions.	2000-06-15

I was scared to live in a big city for the first time in my life, so I comforted myself by inhabiting Middle-Earth for a while.  The sense of  location in this book is palpable; from Rivendell to Lorien, from Bree to  Weathertop to the Mines of Moria, one feels as if one has truly visited the  locations described.<br />The structure of LOTR is in the manner of a  picaresque -- the callow hobbits journey across a wide world and have  various adventures on their quest to deposit the Ring in Mt. Doom.  Characterization is for the most part simplistic, but Frodo and Gollum  achieve some depth, and the story throughout has the force of myth, full of  rich archetypes.  One ought to read this book the way one might read Homer  or Chaucer: it is an old-fashioned epic, drawn in broad, bold strokes.  It  is a spectacularly successful exercise in literary nostalgia.	2000-06-15

But the subject matter here is a bit closer to home, as Pnin  deals with the plight of Russian expatriates adrift in exile after the  Revolution.  One imagines Nabokov identified more than a little with his  lovable, excitable protagonist, and at times the satire parts to reveal  aching sadness.<br />The last two pages of Chapter Five, in which Pnin  ruminates on the memory of a lost love who died in World War II, contain  some of my favorite writing in the English language.  I will quote here an  exquisite paragraph:<br />&quot;Pnin slowly walked under the solemn pines.   The sky was dying.  He did not believe in an autocratic God.  He did  believe, dimly, in a democracy of ghosts.  The souls of the dead, perhaps,  formed committees, and these, in continuous session, attended to the  destinies of the quick.&quot;<br />In passages such as this, Nabokov walks an  astonishing tightrope between caustic comedy and heartbreaking tragedy.	2000-06-15

Amy Fay, a candid observor with a lucid prose style,  brings to life a bygone era, when the old 19th-century ideals of European  culture were in full flower, and music was perhaps the most beloved art  form of all.

Crowe seems to me a lightweight interviewer -- he adopts the same sycophantic tone used by Truffaut in his famous  interviews with Hitchcock.  Perhaps one could have done no better; Wilder  is, after all, in his 90s, and is probably not inclined to give answers in  much detail.

On the one hand, I would not put it up with the works of the best sci-fi authors -- Le Guin, Bradbury, Wells, etc.  The prose has that vaguely  chummy tone that to my mind mars Heinlein and other authors whose  cleverness of ideas outweighs their elegance of expression.  The  presentation of the monsters is absurdly comical -- but it might be seen as  working in a sort of Swiftian satirical tradition.<br />Tenn is good at  exploding human pretensions, and this is really where &quot;Of Men and  Monsters&quot; finds its stride.  A simple mental flip-flop -- what if men  were pests, the cockroaches to another, larger species? -- allows Tenn to  take our race down a notch, and have fun doing it.<br />This is not the  classic work of sci-fi that some have made it out to be, but it's a good  read nonetheless.	2000-06-13

Some of the dabbling in fable styles and neo-primitivism (The Rock That Changed Things, for instance) left me cold.  Ursula is an unabashed feminist, and more  power to her; but she is at her best when she integrates her ethical and  political ideas into her stories, rather than merely proselytizing.<br />The  last three stories, dealing with a bizarre faster-than-light travel method  called &quot;churten&quot; (sort of a descendant of Le Guin's FTL  communication device, the ansible) are collectively worth the price of the  book.  &quot;The Shobies' Story&quot; explores fractured views of reality,  taking its cue from the uncertainties of quantum physics.  &quot;Dancing to  Ganaam&quot; is an enjoyable spoof of the smug Captain Kirk-style space  hero -- I envision its hapless protagonist as a close cousin to Zap  Brannigan in the &quot;Futurama&quot; TV show.  The final story, &quot;A  Fisherman of the Inland Sea,&quot; works a strangely paradoxless  time-travel thread into its exploration of science and human relations.   The mild yet intense scientist-hero is reminiscent of Shevek from &quot;The  Dispossessed,&quot; and Le Guin's suggestion of a workable four-person  marriage is quite intriguing.  It rivals &quot;Hernes&quot; from  &quot;Searoad&quot; as the best short story Le Guin ever wrote.	2000-06-13

The prose is tough and muscular, rough-hewn and perfectly suited to the subject matter.  In its own way, it equals the  prose of Jim Thompson.  Himes' view of a morally-decrepit urban setting is  the standard stuff of noir, but seen through a kind of angry be-bop lens.

Walker does not reach any staggering new insights about the man's character, but he is a stickler for accurate evidential detail  (witness his exhaustive exploration of the infamous but apocryphal  &quot;Beethoven kiss&quot;), and provides a great number of intriguing  anecdotes that help the history to come alive.  If Walker seems a bit  enamored of his subject, he can hardly be blamed -- it is, after all, a  weakness common to all biographers, and in this case doubly so: Liszt  really seems to have been about the nicest man in the history of classical  music.<br />One should not look here for an in-depth critique of Liszt's  merits as a composer, but for straight biography, Walker's work is  unimpeachable.	2000-06-13

Rosen effectively explodes any  lingering remnants of the charge that Chopin was incapable of handling  large forms, or was an &quot;untrained genius.&quot;  He makes a convincing  case for Chopin as the most assiduously trained and capable musician of his  generation -- and it was not a generation of lightweights.  The structural  analyses of the Ballades (particularly the 4th) are excellent, but where  Rosen really shines is in his examination of the Etudes and Mazurkas.  In  the former, he elucidates the Etudes' pivotal place in the history of  concert music, and the interplay of theoretical composition and physical  execution that they embody.  In the latter, Rosen explores the Mazurkas as  the receptacles of Chopin's most subtle, and personal, artistic  accomplishments.<br />Other chapters are not always as convincing, but Rosen's  examinations of Liszt, Mendellsohn, Berlioz, and Schumann all have their  merits.  After Chopin, Schumann is probably closest to Rosen's heart, and  is given the most compelling treatment.	2000-06-13

Passages in the Odes (Melancholy is my favorite) are about as good as this language can expect to get, at least  from a descriptive and sensual standpoint.  Keats doesn't achieve the  meditative transcendence of Wordsworth, but he has his own meditations --  usually more modest in scope, but made noble by the perfection of their  expression.	2000-06-13
