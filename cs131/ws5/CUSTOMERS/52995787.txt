You are a member of Congress, indeed, you are Vice Chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  You call the CIA and tell them you have a source you believe is credible who claims Iran is planning on killing many Americans citizens.  The CIA listens to you because, after all, you vote on their funding, and they decide to ignore your warnings.  What do you do about this?  You write a book.  Thus, \\"Countdown to Terror\\" by Rep. Curl Weldon has resulted.<br /><br /> Incredibly, much of this book confirms what many critics of the Bush Administration have been saying all along: Iran is a threatening power in their region who supports terrorist operations and who seek dominance amongst their neighbors.  Bush's father and the Reagan Administration had policies of guaranteeing a balance of power between Iran and Iraq.  Our policies have allowed Iran and its terrorist influences to expand in power and in threat.<br /><br /> While the book is highly critical of current policies, Weldon fails to fault the source of these decisions: the Bush Administration.  He does fault Bush's newly appointed CIA Director, and Weldon does properly note that it has been devastating that the CIA now produces reports that support current policies rather than concentrating on obtaining the facts needed to make proper judgments.  Unfortunately, Weldon again fails to find fault with the originator of these failed policies, which is the Bush Administration.<br /><br /> Granted, Curt Weldon is a Republican Member of Congress, so he probably does not wish to burn his bridges with President Bush.  He does find room to use the tactic that many Republicans use, and that is fault President Clinton.  In doing so, he minimizes the value of his own message by making his comments partisan.  He would have been better had he chosen to either make a bipartisan critique or to keep his analysis above politics.<br /><br /> A major problem with the book is it fails to explore logical explanations as to why the CIA would discount Rep. Weldon's source, a man he calls \\"Ali\\".  The author claims that \\"simply put, the United States at this moment cannot afford to become entangled in war against Iran.  The intelligence community may fear that this is precisely what could happen by working with Ali\\".  This does not appear to a valid reason for the CIA to discount Ali's messages if in fact they are credible as, if Weldon is correct, ignoring the warnings could lead to devastation within America.<br /><br /> The message Ali delivers in this book, if correct, are truly frightening.  Ali and Weldom believe the terrorist groups of Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Sepah Badr, Sepah and Ansar Islam have united into one large coordinated organization.  Ali claims Iran has 45 suicide pilots planning to crash a planes into several targets, including a nuclear power plant.  It is not logical that the CIA would not consider these as important messages.  What the book does not tell is what is logical: the CIA does not find Rep. Weldon's source Ali as credible.  Indeed, when Rep. Weldon describes Ali as a former high ranking government official in the Shah of Iran's Administration, one wonders how much the current Iranian government would trust and share with an official from the government they overthrew.  The motivations of a critic who originated from the political opposition should be questioned, even if he still has access to the current Iranian government, as the author claims.<br /><br /> Ali also warns that Iran is close to developing a nuclear weapon and is trying to buy an atomic bomb from North Korea.  He further states that Iran is behind much of the insurgency in Iraq, which may have some merit as Iran and Iraq have fought vicious wars and Iran surely wishes to influence Iraq's future at a time of disarray in Iraq.  Another claim is that Osama Bid Laden is, or at least was, hiding in Iran, which might at least explain why our forces haven't been able to find him in Afghanistan or Pakistan.  Ali predicted Yasser Arafat would be assassinated, and there is debate as to whether or not that was his fate.  Ali also provides interesting facts about Iran, such as their terrible roads that lead to 15,000 deaths annually.<br /><br /> Ali claims that Khameni, Iran's spiritual and political leader, has stated that Mahdi, the Iman who in Shiite theology will come back to Earth to destroy infidels, told him in a dream to strike the United States within its boundaries.  The book then curiously includes a hand written letter from Ali, which is not a good way to protect a source should he in fact be betraying his Iranian government.<br /><br /> The book makes for interesting reading for thought and debate.  Whether it is credible, whether the CIA is correct, or perhaps whether our intelligence community secretly finds this credible but refuses to state so publicly, is open for discussion.  What is certain is that the warnings are serious.  We just don't know if they are credible.in Afghanistan or Pakistan.

Lawrence, PittsburghÂ’s Renaissance Mayor (Pittsburgh Series in Social and Labor History)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Great Biography of a Giant in Pennsylvania Politics	David Lawrence, Governor of Pennsylvania from 1959-1963 and longtime Democratic Party leader in Pittsburgh, and to a lesser extent statewide, is the subject of this biography.  While he directed the Pittsburgh Democratic Party for decades before serving as Pittsburgh's Mayor for 13 years and then capping his career as our Governor for four years, the one thing he refused to be called was \\"boss.\\"  While he was a leader, he refused to be considered by others as a boss, hence the title of this book.<br /><br /> Lawrence literally grew up in politics, volunteering in his first campaign at the age of nine.  He performer various, mostly gopher and literature distribution tasks for the Democratic Party during the dark era when the Democratic Party was barely functioning.  Lawrence rose to chair the Pittsburgh Democratic Party where he strove to create a political operation.  Times were not good for Democrats: they would even lose the minority Jury Commissioner's seat to an independent candidate.  At times, the electoral futility of the local Democrats would lead to calls for a new party chairman.  Yet Lawrence held on for an important reason: no one else wanted to spend the amount of time Lawrence did in being the party chairman.<br /><br /> Lawrence brought slow but mixed successes to the Democratic Party.  In 1929, he proudly announced that Democrats finally had enough supporters to place poll watchers at every Allegheny County precinct.  On the negative side, the number of Democratic Party registrants fell in half while Lawrence was county chairman before it began increasing again.  Lawrence even admitted that the Democratic organization frequently cooperated with the dominant Republican Party at times in return for patronage positions.  Patronage then was very important, as half of the 5,200 registered Democrats in Allegheny County in the late 1920s held political jobs.<br /><br /> Two important events would shape politics, and with them, Lawrence's life.  First, Republicans even back then were dishonest, as it was exposed that Republicans had illegally registered about 50,000 voters.  This led the public to correctly identify the Republican Party as the party of corruption.  Second, the election of Franklin Roosevelt and the efforts of Democratic Party's New Deal social programs to save America from depression transformed American politics.  It would help David Lawrence's career that he was an early FDR supporter and that his work for Democrats won him much regard.<br /><br /> Following Roosevelt's election in 1932, George Earle became the first Democrat elected Governor in Pennsylvania since 1894.  David Lawrence became Democratic State Chairman.  In addition, Governor Earle selected Lawrence to serve as Secretary of the Commonwealth, which was a highly influential policy office.  It also found Lawrence divided between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, as Lawrence continue to lead the Allegheny County Democrats.  Meanwhile, Roosevelt's WPA program brought $70 million to Allegheny County, of which 80% of that went towards wages, brining many people out of the depression into employment.  Soon, Democratic registration surpassed Republican registration in Pittsburgh.  Lawrence is credited with building a powerful local Democratic Party organization, and it is noted that Republicans never won a major election in Pittsburgh from 1938 through 1966, when Lawrence died.<br /><br /> In Harrisburg, Lawrence was placed in charge of getting legislative approval of Governor Earle's Little New Deal proposals.  Earle and Lawrence fortunately had cooperative Democratic House legislators, as the House had its first Democratic majority in half a century.  Lawrence saw to it that the House Steering Committee consisted of members who supported the Little New Deal.  Lawrence attended most House and Senate legislative sessions, sitting at the side with a vacant chair, where he provided his advice, often to a legislator sitting in the no longer vacant chair.  Lawrence would call regular legislative caucuses where he would explain the Governor's, and the Democratic Party's, positions on issues facing them.<br /><br /> Lawrence, though, not only disliked being called a boss, he did not act like one. Caucus meetings were considered a place of free and open exchange.  He allowed dissent, so long as the dissenting legislator had a good reason. Yet, it is noted that Lawrence usually got his way.  If there was dissent, a controversial bill was tabled until passage could be secured later.  It is noted most of the Earle-Lawrence legislation was passed the House.  Yet, most of it was then defeated by the Senate, which still had a Republican majority.<br /><br /> Major legislative battles resulted over how to handle Pennsylvania's depression-era budget.  The Chamber of Commerce projected that state government would require a $326 million budget in 1935-36 with projected revenues of $148 million, leaving a gap of  $178 million that was even greater than revenues.  Further, the Federal government required state government to provide $120 million in relief in order to continue qualified for Federal assistance.  State Senator and Republican State Chairman Harvey Taylor announced that Senate Republicans would agree to only provide the Federal government with $57 million.  Long negotiations provided for a 6% tax on corporate income and increased taxes on utilities, gas, cigarettes, and amusements.<br /><br /> Democrats gained control of both legislative chambers in the 1936 elections.  The Little New Deal, in what is considered as the greater era of liberal legislative in Pennsylvania's history, was passed.  365 of Governor Earle's 371 proposals were enacted with Lawrence's help.  Administration bills would appear in pink folders so legislators would know they came from the Governor.  Major legislation allowing collective bargaining, providing teacher tenure, creating a Department of Public Assistance, protecting employee rights, creating the Labor Relations Board, providing slum clearance and public housing, outlawing unfair bank practices, and creating the nation's first turnpike all became law.<br /><br /> On the negative side, Lawrence began a life-long feud with Attorney General Charles Margiotti.  Margiotti accused Lawrence of illegally requiring county Democratic Party organizations to raise funds from patronage workers.  Although Lawrence would be found not guilty after the fall elections, the scandal helped the Republicans return to power on election day.  Lawrence was removed as Democratic State Chairman.<br /><br /> Personal tragedy would changed Lawrence's life and career.  After two of his sons were killed in an automobile accident, Lawrence threw himself back into his work.  He sought and regained his position as Democratic State Committee.  While working to keep Democratic factions together, it was discovered the only candidate for Pittsburgh Mayor agreeable to the major factions was himself.  Lawrence then ran for, and was elected, Mayor.<br /><br /> Lawrence set up to become a great Mayor.  He met privately with New York's famed Machiavellian local policy maker Robert Moses for ideas on how to succeed.  As Mayor, he spent many hours negotiating labor contracts and in dealing with disgruntled council members.  He worked hard for flood control programs and lobbied hard for a dam that finally began construction in 1949.  He fought the air quality problem by requiring the use of smokeless coal, knowing that this would, and did, cause many voters to turn against him when they were forced to pay more for this coal.  Lawrence guided the Lower Hill redevelopment program which, at the time, was the largest such project undertaken although without a past for guidelines, resulted in mixed opinions of success.  As Mayor, Lawrence implemented the Civic Unity Council to handle incidences of racial and religious discrimination.  While this early Council had limited effectiveness, it was groundbreaking and would lead Lawrence to a later Presidential appointment.<br /><br />In 1958, David Lawrence was elected Governor.  After observing the previous Governor's struggles with the legislature, Governor Lawrence worked more towards legislative cooperation.  For instance, he won legislative approval to increase the sales tax by agreeing to exemptions that legislators wanted.  He won successes in balancing the state budget, establishing medical care for low income senior citizens, creating a law that registered and regulated lobbyists, prohibiting billboards besides interstate highways, and strengthening air pollution laws and fair employment laws. Interestingly, Lawrence maintained his Pittsburgh ties and would return to Pittsburgh most weekends to continue serving as Chairman of the Urban Redevelopment Authority.  Lawrence was proud that he inherited a state budget deficit and ended his term as Governor with a $16.6 billion surplus in Fiscal Year 1961-62.  Yet, to his chagrin, the taxes he raised in order to achieve this became a campaign issue that helped elected Republican Bill Scranton over Democrat Richardson Dilworth as Governor in 1962.<br /><br /> David Lawrence urged John Kennedy to select Lyndon Johnson as his 1960 running mate and even game the nominating speech for Johnson at the Democratic National Convention.  In 1963, President Kennedy named Lawrence to chair the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing.  Lawrence found this work frustrating at times as it would not be until after his death that the anti-discriminatory commercial housing lending practices he argued for would be adopted.<br /><br /> David Lawrence had a great career of ups and downs throughout several of Pennsylvania's political eras.  In sum, he ranks as one of the great political giants in state history.

This book is the result of what Buzz saw during those four years.  It provides an extremely candid insight into what Ed Rendell is like as a person while dramatically presenting the difficulties facing a large city Mayor.<br /><br /> \\"A Prayer for the City\\" also follows the lives of four Philadelphians during this same period.  This makes for interesting contrasts that shows how the story of Philadelphia during this era affected people differently.  Although, I wonder why, after several years of following a Mayor around, the book did not concentrate more on the Mayor.<br /><br /> The book shows Ed Rendell, the person, flaws and strengths.  Ed Rendell is presented as a strongly driven man who works hard, knows his goals, and does his best to reach those goals.  This is seen in contract negotiations where he know what he wanted entering, he knew contingencies, and he knew how to reach his goals, which included allowing others to gain credit and his opposition to come to agreement by being able to walk away from the negotiating table with the ability to claim victory, or else the agreements would never have been reached.  Agree or disagree with the result, this ability to engage in complex and strategic thinking and reacting allows readers to conclude that Ed Rendell is a very skilled and driven leader.<br /><br /> Ed Rendell is seen as a hard worker, but as one who doesn't react well to overexertion.  He is conflicted by the expectations that the Mayor must go to the hospital of any wounded police officer, knowing that a private family time can be seen as being inappropriately disturbed by a politician and the media.  Yet, as Ed Rendell lost his father when he was 14, he related well to the children of slain and wounded officers. When the pressure and lack of rest got to be too much, Ed Rendell can scream, throw things, and even do bodily harm, such as digging his heel into another or grabbing a photographer enough to bruise her arm.<br /><br /> Ed Rendell also knows the key to victory is to build coalitions with necessary partners.  In order to get legislation through City Council, he did his best to stroke the ego and give credit, even when it was not due to him, to City Council John Street.  Of course, we wonder what John Street thinks when he reads some of the negative sentiments expressed by Rendell in the book that were kept from him at this time.<br /><br /> The successes of Rendell's first term are presented.  A structural deficit that threatened to bankrupt the city was eliminated.  Job losses reversed and small job gains began.  The man Al Gore dubbed \\"American's Mayor\\" went on and has become our Governor.  Readers will see that dealing with the complexities of being a Mayor should serve well as a prelude to being Governor.  One point clear from this book is that Ed Rendell means to be a good leader, for as he said himself, \\"if I walk out of here voted out, I walk with my head held high because I've done the right thing.\\"digging his heel into another or grabbing a photographer enough to bruise her arm.   <br /> <br /> Ed Rendell also knows the key to victory is to build coalitions with necessary partners.

Why else do clients pay $50,000 to $200,000 in fees to lobbyists who represent their interests\\" asks a book written about a part time legislatur, and this was back during the 1980s.  \\"The Colorado General Assembly\\" is in insightful book into the Colorado legislative process.<br /><br /> Colorado prides itself as being a \\"citizen's legislature\\" and voters in Colorado approved a Constitutional amendment limiting the Colorado legislature to a 120 day limit for sessions.  Unlike the more professional full-time legislatures in some more populous states, the lower pay and limited days of sessions leads to a high turnover rate amongst Colorado legislatures.  One major difficulty this creates a lack of professional legislators with strong institutional knowledge.  Thus, lobbyists are seen as being more powerful in Colorado than in many other states.  In Colorado, lobbyists outnumber legislators by a 5 to 1 ratio.  The lobbyists command much of the knowledge upon which legislators rely and, with a full-time professional commitment towards crafting favorable legislation, they have become very influential in Colorado.  Many lobbyists are former legislators who have decided to use their legislative experiences to earn more money.  The author notes circumstances where legislators have asked if lobbyists have come to agreement on legislation amongst themselves, rather than it being legislators guiding the process.<br /><br /> In 1986 in Colorado, political action committees accounted for 62% of all contributions to State Senate campaigns and 59% of all contributions to State House campaigns, compared to 29% of contributions to candidates for Governor and 25% of all contributions to other statewide campaigns.  This helps cement the bonds between Colorado legislators and lobbyists.<br /><br /> The role of lobbyists takes on greater influence when it is recognized that Colorado's budget process gives the legislature a stronger role compared to many other states.  The author states Colorado has a strong legislative-centered budget and that, although the Governor submits an annual budget to the legislature, the Colorado legislature has long protected its powers over determining much of the budget.  Still, the results are similar to most others states' budgets: namely budgets that are incremental adjustments to previous budgets.  Colorado, though, is known for its relatively smaller budgets and for pushing a relatively greater portion of the tax budget onto local governments.<br /><br /> The public can have a more direct role in creating laws in Colorado.  The public is permitted to initiate legislation in addition to allowing citizens to place statutory proposals onto the general elections ballot.  The author notes many political analysts, though, find this a poor way to create law as the result is often \\"sloppy and unrefined,\\" yet, as the author notes, \\"it does makes for fun and interesting politics.\\"<br /><br /> Constituents rarely contact Colorado legislators, according to the author, and, with few staff, most representatives have slow to respond to their mail.  Some observers note some Colorado legislators let the mail pile up on the desk and then just throw it all away.  Colorado legislators look to other legislators and lobbyists for information on legislative issues.  As such, the author notes that good testimony at a legislative hearing has been observed to make a difference as it can sometimes be the best way to inform some legislators on key matters.  Still, this does not guarantee that legislators will be expert at their jobs, for as State Sen. Ralph Cole once noted \\"it's really hard to legislate against the stupidity of the legislators.\\"<br /><br /> The author notes that legislative leaders and committee chairs work more cohesively in the Colorado House than in the Senate, which may be the opposite of what would be expected for the larger sized House.  Yet, the House leaders and committee chairs had a greater tradition of meeting and coordinating activities more often than in the Senate, and this creates this difference.<br /><br /> In sum, Colorado has an interesting legislature.  Yet, the lack of professionalism and reliance upon lobbying interests should allow most to conclude that it is a system upon which improvements could be made.leaders and committee chairs had a greater tradition of meeting and coordinating activities more often than in the Senate, and this creates this difference. <br /> <br /> In sum, Colorado has an interesting legislature.

It is interesting reading one legislator's account and descriptions of how the legislative process works.  Political theory and reality are compared.  For instance, the author notes that it was Machiavelli who noted that strong societies channel their political conflicts and social frictions into a democratic process.  These democratic battles actually strengthen society.  It is governments that suppress conflict that become unstable.  He notes this appears to be true, as no democratic government has even gone to war against another democratic government.<br /><br /> The author observes that political mobilization is dominated by wealthier political interests.  This is especially noticed in political fights over Massachusetts's health care system, which is a focus of this book.  This fight is particular fierce for one wealthy side's gain would come at the expense of another wealthy side.  This clash of political titans creates a major schism in attempting to make any changes to the current health care system.<br /><br /> While wealthier interests may have advantages, this does not mean that parties with lesser influence are forgotten.  The author observes that while political leaders from both parties had favored landlords in revising landlord-tenant law, neither side wished to be publicly identified with landlords.  Thus, the legislation was revised in a manner than favored tenants, even though tenants appeared to have less influence over the legislature.<br /><br /> The author urges parties in a political dispute to learn the real and personal interests of the parties involved in the dispute.  Knowing these interests and how they would be affected by each step helps in guiding parties as to the risks and rewards of taking alternative steps.<br /><br /> Some political scientists state that political change tends to occur incrementally.  While the author concludes this is the usual process, he does argue that comprehensive changes are also possible and should not be overlooked.  Comprehensive changes can occur when those with political power perceive that a problem is serious enough that comprehensive changes are required and the political elements are aligned for comprehensive changes to be approved.<br /><br /> It is good to see state legislators writing about their legislative experiences.  From notations such as John McDonough's observation that legendary Massachusetts Senate President William Bulger was not as harsh as his reputation to more general observations about the political process in theory, this book is very useful to people who wish to learn more about state legislatures and politics.ge tends to occur incrementally.

US	52995787	R2MIRP39ZN4JC4	1568027346	675447708	Heavy Lifting: the Job Of the American Legislature	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Excellent Book on State Legislatures	Alan Rosenthal, perhaps the foremost academic authority on state legislatures has published another insightful look into state legislatures.  In this latest study, \\"Heavy Lifting\\", we learn that most of the public has a good idea how legislatures operate, and they don't like what they see.<br /><br /> The legislature system is designed to look bad in the public eye.  Legislators may do a good job fighting for their constituencies, and thus garner the support of the people of their district, yet the interests behind these constituents conflicts with interests represented by other legislators.  The meshing of these interests lead to struggles, defeats, and compromises that fail to fully please the interests at hand.  From the standpoint of constituents that are viewing an outcome that failed to meet their expectation, the legislative process is a failure.  From the standpoint of analyzing how legislative systems should operate, the process may be basically the best possible operation.<br /><br /> The expectations the public has of legislatures has changed, according to Alan Rosenthal.  Constituency groups decades ago perhaps understood the reality of compromise better than advocates today realize. The media, which observes that conflict is more interesting than everyday good news, seems more apt to cover the battles of ideas within legislatures.  The increasing expense and negativity of political campaigns exacerbates the legislatures' declining perceptions.<br /><br /> The constituent demands upon legislatures appear to be increasing while the available amount of time does not increase.  Even gaining support of a majority of both houses of a legislature is not always enough, as the Governor then plays a critical role.  Governors present various leadership styles and abilities to cooperate with legislatures, who themselves can be supportive or detrimental towards resolving conflicts between the branches of government.<br /><br /> A good legislator, according to Alan Rosenthal, is one who successfully represents his district's constituents, is skillful at the lawmaking process, and is able to properly balance the legislative role with the role of the Governor.  The author surveyed Ohio legislators and found that 62% of Senators and 56% of Representatives surveyed stated that believed more attention to their representational duties would make them better legislators and that 38% of Senators and 44% of Representatives stated more attention to their lawmaking responsibilities would make them better legislators.<br /><br /> Legislators are busy, including legislators from states where the legislature is considered part time.  The author surveyed legislators in five states and discovered that 46% of legislators responding stated they spent 60 or more hours per week at their legislative jobs while 29% states they spent from 50 to 59 hours.  The number of hours spent working was higher for legislators who served longer, which reflects the additional duties often given to veteran legislators.<br /><br /> The author believes most legislators do successfully represent their districts.  They identify with the people of their districts and their needs.  Advocating their concerns before both the legislature and administrative agencies is seen a key purpose of their legislative duties.  This provides many legislators with the sense of fulfillment they seek from being legislators.<br /><br /> 19,000 people from all states were surveyed.  It was found that, over the past two decades, 7% stated they had contacted their state representative and 5% stated they had contacted their state senate.  While much of such contact was part of an organized effort to contact legislators, it does show that a sizable number of people have personally invested time in reaching out to their representatives.  This contact becomes muddled, as there seldom is a clear and consistent message to legislators uniting his or her constituency.  Further, the author concludesthat most people do not follow closely follow legislative issues and matters.<br /><br /> The growing nationwide organization of many interest groups along with the increased ability to exchange information is making advocacy to legislatures across the nation more active.  Political party identification is a strong cohesive force for most legislators, and party identity and party caucuses are strong factors in determining how legislators respond to legislation.  At times, attempting to gain a partisan advantage is a critical part of legislative decision making strategies.  This can create difficulties, as legislators may find themselves conflicted between their caucus and their constituencies should their goals differ.  The author presents this conflict as perhaps a legislator's greatest challenge.<br /><br /> While it is difficult to identify exactly what it is that makes a legislator a good representative, the author notes there should be a positive connection between a legislator and the views of his or her constituency, an ability to deliberate legislation, and an ability to provide leadership, although this requires experience and resources as well as the proper leadership skills.<br /><br /> This is an excellent book for students of state legislatures in particular and of governmental decision making in general.author concludes that most people do not follow closely follow legislative issues and matters. <br /> <br /> The growing nationwide organization of many interest groups along with the increased ability to exchange information is making advocacy to legislatures across the nation more active.

The bulk of this book concentrates on the diplomatic years of Vance McCormick, as he served during the times leading to our entry in World War I through the war years and he was at a participant at the peace talks.<br /><br /> It is interesting reading how the editor and Penn State Harrisburg students went through nine boxes of family letters and documents to compile this book.  Students of local history may wish to note that Vance McCormick was a director of the Central Iron and Steel Works which used to be located in the southern part of Harrisburg, that he was elected to City Council and then, in 1902, as Mayor as a reform Democrat, and then went on to own the Harrisburg Patriot newspaper and found the Evening News, which lasted until a few years ago.<br /><br /> American History scholars will find the bulk of this book as an insight into one diplomat's perspective of our effort to conduct a blockade of German ships during the First World War and of various missions before and after the war.  Football fans may find it interesting to note that Vance McCormick was an All American quarterback on an 1892 Yale team that outscored its opponents by 435 to 0, but that McCormick scored none of those points.  In football then, players played both offense and defense, and McCormick was noted for his defensive skills and his leadership at quarterback during a time when quarterbacks seldom scored goals.<br /><br /> The set of Vance McCormick diary entries during 1917, when he led the War Trade Board, fail to provide the perspectives that later diary entries provide.  He would write comments such as \\"we made some progress, but not as much as I had hoped\\" without describing the circumstances of the discussions that would have proven more enlightening to future generations of readers.  Still, his notations that he was impressed with the commitment the British had for the war allows us to realize that the American government was impressed that America could eventually successfully serve as a British ally.<br /><br /> Later diary entries, after the United States entered the war, are more vibrant.  His descriptions of the miles of destruction around Verdun, site of the war's most devastating battlefield, are among highlights found in these diaries.  We learn about his concern during the peace talks about the sinking condition of the German people and his concern about the imperialism and militarism expressed by the war victors.  Vance McCormick thought it was ridiculous of Lloyd George of England to promise the British people he would extract $120 billion in war reparations from Germany as Germany had no ability to pay anywhere close to that amount.  This becomes of historic interest as he may have perceived the dangers that many historians believe ultimately led to the German resentment that led to World War II.  Further, Vance McCormick expressed concern over blockades of Poland, Estonia, Lettland, and Lithuania, which the British supported, fearing that the blockade would allow these countries to fall to Russia.  Of special note is his concern that the Germans might not accept the peace agreement as there were fears the French and English armies could no longer continue to battle the German army and that, should the peace talks collapse, it would be left for the American army to fight the German army.<br /><br /> The book notes that Vance McCormick placed his opinions above political party loyalty.  He refused, as a supporter of prohibition, to support anti-prohibition Democratic nominees for President in 1928 and for Governor in 1930.  Dauphin County Democrats then ousted a party slate run by McCormick.<br /><br /> Reading diary entries of a diplomat may be boring to many, but they serve an important historical purpose.  Reviving insights into these historical moments maintains our awareness and connections to our past.  It has been reported that, in 2004, the last known surviving combat wounded American veteran of World War I passed away.  There are historians who observe that we could have learned from World War I the mistakes that led to World War II.  Let us not let this history dissolve.

This book, written just a few decades after he died, indicates how he has viewed in his era than more current biographies do.  Further, this is a complete description of his entire life.  Readers see how his energy and unwillingness to compromise were lifelong traits.<br />Thaddeus Stevens hailed from Vermont and first practiced law in Gettysburg.  Being close to the Mason-Dixon line, he saw the injustices of runaway slaves crossing into Pennsylvania whose masters wished them returned.  Stevens developed a notable legal career defending runaway slaves, even paying for their freedoms himself when he lost the case.<br />Interestingly, it would be hatred that would drive Thaddeus Stevens into politics.  His distrust of Masons led him to the Anti-Mason party and into election to the Pennsylvania legislature.  While he worked hard on unsuccessful efforts to remove Masons from various aspects of juries and judges in cases involving other Masons, his greatest achievements were in education.  His skillful orations convinced legislators to increase funds for schools.  He defense of free public education is what he considered his greatest political achievement.<br />Stevens had a proposal that played an important role in the Civil War.  He offered legislation that declared that none of the Southern cities remained as ports of entry.  Although Lincoln was slow to agree to this idea, it has a key role in slowing the economies of the Southern states.  A blockade by Northern states could have been challenged by foreign nations.  Yet, a foreign nation that attempted to enter a port not recognzied by a host country would have committed an act of war under international law.<br />Stevens was uncompromising, and he objected to President Johnson's efforts at Reconstruction.  Stevens was a leader in the drive to impeach and the failed attempt to oust Andrew Johnson from the Presidency.  This was his last major effort, and he passed away in 1868.<br />This is a lucid and interesting book about Thaddeus Stevens.  By learning more about the life of Stevens before the Civil War, we learn how his actions were a continuation of a life's previous efforts.  People interested in the legislative aspects of the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as 19th century Pennsylvania politics will find this a most useful book.t to oust Andrew Johnson from the Presidency.

The author followed 12 state legislators in search of what made them effective legislators and has produced this book as a result of his research.<br />The book analyzes previous research and theories regarding legislative representation.  Michael A. Smith concludes there is no universal definition of how to define representation, noting that even legislators are dynamically redefining how they consider their own styles of representation as circumstances change.<br />This book provides great insight based on actual observations.  Michael A. Smith discusses how legislators from lower or moderate income urban areas tended to be the strongest advocates for their districts and often take the lead in advancing causes that help their constituents.  Legislators from wealthier districts who face tougher reelection campaigns tend to more passively wait for constituents to bring issues to them before advocating such issues.  Legislators who wish to run for office tend to be outspoken advocates.  Legislators with little or no ambition for higher office tend to try to come across as more level-headed.<br />While the author concludes there is no &quot;grand theory&quot; on describing how legislators behanve, these observations and categorizaitons are very useful.  It is helpful to read disucssions of theory with actual observations.	2004-06-10

While the names in the book have been changed, the events are real, according to the author.  The book, written in diary form, follows Peg George from her first local political meetings in 1967.  She discovered she enjoyed running for office, even as a sacrificial Democratic candidate in an area vastly outnumbered by Republicans.  She won election to the School Board by campaigning door to door.  The machinations of School Board politics, from budgeting squabbles to visiting schools and attending obligatory football games are described along with her reactions.<br />  The positive reactions she received caused her to run for the State Senate, thinking she was being encouraged to seek office from friends and local political leaders.  To her surprise, political leaders backed a candidate with more money and some friends crossed her.  She discovered that politics can mean betrayal from people whose jobs are threatened and that support can be influenced by those who control patronage.<br />  Peg George recovered in 1976 to suggestions she run for the State House.  Winning in the aftermath of Watergate, she found her political courage tested soon after taking office when she supported an unsuccessful motion requesting the House Speaker to resign.  She was relieved when the local press praised her political independence.<br />  Her book describes other legislative lessons: committee meetings where votes occur on bills few know about without discussion, offers from leadership to change her vote in return for funding within her district, how legislative leaders vote for her without her knowledge in her absence, how some legislators will steal other's ideas and introduce them as their own legislation, and of paper clip fights on the House floor.  She is also one of the few politicians to admit that campaign contributors can affect how one feels about contributors.<br />  The diary form of this book allows readers to gain insights to how the author reacts to the events she describes.  For instance, we learn during her service in the legislature that &quot;this place does something to you and you begin to like what it does...the feeling that I am part of important decisions&quot;.  At the end of her political career, we discover that she writes how &quot;I like myself better now.  I seem to be a nicer person.&quot;  Yet, as the book admits, she &quot;wouldn't have missed it for the world.&quot;r />   The diary form of this book allows readers to gain insights to how the author reacts to the events she describes.

This book is highly recommended.<br />  An interesting observation this author makes is how the legislature has become more ideologically divisive.  In previous studies from the 1950s, legislative elections were fought over few issues and legislative matters seldom reached &quot;liberal/conservative&quot; perspective splits.  Today, legislative matters are considered far more partisan.<br />  The book provides a historical basis for the current Pennsylvania legislature.  The Pennsylvania legislature, which began in 1682, is our planet's oldest legislative body.  We learn about the composition of the legislative today as opposed to a few decades ago, in terms of qualities such as political party (increasingly Republican), educational achievement (the legislature has become more college educated), and occupation (fewer lawyers lately).  Readers further learn about the importance of political party organizations in legislative campaigns (they're important), how legislators spend their time (mostly on constituent matters), and how most legislators think (moderately conservative.)<br />  A critical change in recent decades has been the increased professionalism of the legislature as what was once a part-time body turned into a full-time operation.  Interesting, the composition of the legislature in terms of race and gender varied little during this change.	2004-04-25

This book is a detailed and insightful autobiography of a Washington State Senator.  Readers learn what it is like to have served in the Washington State Senate, whether innocent or not.<br />  We learn about the life of one State Senator: from dealing with constituents, the increase in campaign costs and the growing importance of campaign contributors, the growing influence of lobbyists and political action committee, and the decreasing influence of campaign volunteers and constituents.  We learn from the author's many observations, such as his belief that the impression a politician makes can be more important than the political positions taken by the politician.<br />  Detailed information on the legislative process, as witnessed from a practical view from a person who participated in it, is presented.  We learn about the critical legislative budgeting process and the factors that lead legislators to approve or disapprove budget proposals.  We also learn that a legislator can be important when killing a legislative idea even more so then when advocating a bill.<br />  &quot;A Majority of One&quot; is an extensive, insightful, and well written autobiography.

He was an arrogant man who boasted of his ability to wheel and deal.  He was an intelligent man (graduated second in his Harvard class) who entered politics by convincing dishonest political leaders that they should not feel guilt about in their plundering of public funds, but only in their blundering of their plundering.  Penrose offered what they sought: a dishonest leader with intelligence.<br />  Penrose burst into Pennsylvania state politics with deliberate exuberance.  He purposely refused to meet with legislative leaders in order to get them to come to him.  As a State Senator and bank director, he helped direct banks holding state funds on how to avoid following bank regulations.  Penrose also owned a paper company to which the legislature awarded trolley route contracts that he, in turn, sold to existing trolley companies for millions of dollars.<br />  Penrose was elected to the U.S. Senate during the era when the state legislature elected U.S. Senators.  As Penrose explained, in such legislative votes &quot;there isn't going to be any selection.  There's going to be an auction.&quot;<br />  Penrose ironically helped change destiny by assisting in the unsuccesful attempt to exile Teddy Roosevelt into political oblivion by making him Vice President.  Roosevelt became President after the assassination of President McKinley.<br />  In sum, Penrose explained his philosophy of politics as &quot;once I thought success in politics required 90% brains and 10% guts.  Now I know it's just 10% gall and 90% wind.&quot;  This book solidly demonstrates how this fit this giant of political arrogance and corruption, Boies Penrose.	2003-12-23

That this legal career was interrupted by eight years of service as Governor almost would appear a diversion from someone who rose from the Board of Directors of his local ACLU to be a United States Attorney and ultimately U.S. Attorney General. Yet, as the book informs, Dick Thornburgh was definitely a politician who successfully balanced switching between political and legal careers.<br />  It was Dick Thornburgh's poltical work that caught the attention of Republican Party leader Elsie Hillman that led her to successfully push the political buttons to get Thornbugh the position of U.S. Attorney.  Thornburgh had earlier worked in a Senate campaign and run a losing race for Congress.  Although his preparation for the job was lacking, as Thornburgh admits his initial reaction was \\"What does a U.S. Attorney do?\\", Thornburgh had a distinguished career as a federal prosecutor.  He went after organized crime figures and public corruption, although his zeal fadedat times, as when he refused a request by Arlen Specter to investigate some fellow Republicans on allegal illegal campaign payments.<br />  A weakness of the book is it lacks depth of analysis in explaining how he chose many of his policies as Governor.  The book excels in describing the Three Mile Island crisis.  Here, the book is descriptive and reflective and leaves readers with useful advice on crisis management.  Readers of legal history and Pennsylvania politics will find this an important book to examine.	2003-12-05

As Speaker Wright describes the legislature, &quot;there is no IQ test to gain admission to the legislature.  The place would not be full if there were.&quot;  The author presents personal insights with critical and blatant honesty of what thought of many Governors and fellow legislators with whom he served.<br />  Ralph Wright was a political oddity in that he was a Democratic Speaker in one the nation's more Republican states while Republicans held a majority of legislative seats.  Further, he was a liberal Democrat generally at odds with Republican philosophies.  Yet, he was able to swing enough Republican legislators to not only elect him Speaker yet continue to keep him in office.<br />  This book offers what Mr. Wright claims was his secret to success: Listen.  He would observe what other legislators said and learn what their goals are.  He won the confidence and approval from others by being a good listener.  With this book, we learn what he was thinking while listening.<br />  Ironically, Speaker Wright states his least favorite years in the legislature were when Democrats won a majority of legislative seats along with there being a Democratic Governor.  He tells of nearly winning an uphill struggle to win single payer universal health care coverage for all Vermonters, only to have it killed by fellow Democrats.<br />  In sum, as the book is titled, the author argues that &quot;all politics is personal&quot;.  Most campaigns he has observed rested on the personalities and composition of the candidates themselves.  He proudly states he never spent more than $250 on a legislative race.  In small legislative districts in Vermont where legislators represent about 3,750 voters, it is easier for legislators to develop persoanl contacts with constituents.  The lessons of the personal nature of politics do offer important lessons for all.  Unfortunately, the lessons may be more attuned to a different, although perhaps more refreshing, era.  Ralph Wright's legislative career came to an end when an opponent spent 75 times more than did Wright on the campaign.  Perhaps all politics WAS personal.all.

John Murtha's autobiography presents stories of his life intertwined with lessons he has learned that should be noted by others.  His career in Congress, and before that in the military, allow him to provide much useful guidance.<br />  Among the most valuable lessons this book stresses is the important of obtaining, analyzing, and understanding intelligence.  Too many decisions, in defense and politics, result from not comprehending the situation at hand and making poor decisions based on faulty data.  He argues, and shows with numerous examples, how faulty intelligence, or ignoring critical facts, often is the difference between success and failure.<br />  The book takes us through his personal experiences as an intelligence officer in Viet Nam and discovering the reason why enemy bases could not be located was because enemy soldiers used underground tunnels; how poor military planning in Viet Nam signficantly reduced the effectiveness of our soldiers; how he warned our troops in Lebanon were vulnerable to terrorist attack; of how he helped monitor elections in the Philippines and in Panama; among other important events.  His book deals with the attempts of Ferdinand Marcos and of Manuel Noriega to deny the forces of democracy.  Fortunately, their efforts to extend power illegitimately were halted.<br />  This book discusses various foreign policies and military affairs matters that have become the specialization that John Murtha has developed in Congress.  His personal insights are enlightening.  This book makes a valuable resource to those wishing to learn more about public policies.	2003-08-28

A teenage fight where his opponent subsequently died would haunt Leo Gorcey.  That and his parent's divorce were probable causes for a turn towards alcoholism.  Lending a job as a Dead End Kid may have been aided by the fact that Leo Gorcey was, indeed, a natural for the role.<br />  This book examines the life and character of Leo Gorcey.  Full of antedotes, this is a riveting and often amusing tale of a talented but conflicted man.  A confused child, Leo, Jr. (the book's author) grew up with an oft abusive father wondering &quot;was Dad trying to make me the man he wasn't?&quot;  Instead, Leo, Jr. discovers that he is repeating many of his father's behaviors.  A search for discovering about a father becomes a search for discovery of self and learning how to come to terms with anger and forgiveness.  This is a powerful story, both for its history and for its emotional impact.  I recommend this book highly.	2003-07-07

The goal of the book is that legislatures can learn from each other.  There are global lessons to be found in the legislative process.<br />  Among the universal traits is that the number of issues facing all legislatures is greater than there is time to look at each.  One of the important decision each legislature faces is how to create a process that best handles this.  Understanding this process tell us much about what type of legislature that exists.  Who gets noticed and who gets ignored tells much about that government's societal power structure.<br />  Nearly every legislature has to develop rules and procedures and to decide how to handle constituents.  Further universal concerns include how legislators are selected, how they may retain office, and whether or not legislators should be career professionals.  We also learn American legislators tend to have greater resources than legislatures elsewhere.  Further, turnover amongst American legislators generally is less than turnover elsewhere.<br />  Readers should develop an appreciation for the difficulties legislators face in different countries.  One researcher claims it generally is in America where political institutions are created and improved and then the rest of the world tends to learn from American experiences.  We need to go a good job, not only for our citizens, yet as an example for the rest of the world.	2003-05-27

This is one of the best state history books ever, as it is comprehensive, readable, and vastly informative. Its chapters are well written and skillfully documented by notable experts on each chapter's time periods and subjects.<br />  To highlight portions of the book does injustice to the multitude of other subjects.  Still, among aspects this book discusses include how William Penn's treaty with Native Americans symbolized a new spirit of cooperation in American, and how his son's breaking of that treaty perhaps introduced another national spirit.<br />  We see how how industrial owners persuaded Pennsylvania government to make unprecedented infrastructure developments in railroads, roads, banks, and canals that both made Pennsylvania an industrial leader and the owners quite wealthy.<br />  The book tells us of the first Paleo-Indians who probably came to Pennsylvania 14,000 years ago.  Their lifestyles influence through today, as many present highways follow the same routes Indians used for centuries prior.<br />  19th century Philadelphia's business leaders are described as being more centered on their own businesses than on the state of their community than leaders in other cities.  This led to New York and Baltimore surpassing Philadelphia economically.<br />  At the turn of the 20th century, child labor was an important factor of Pennsylvanian family income, often representing one third to one half of what a family earned.  One sixth of households increased their incomes by renting to boarders.<br />  Pennsylvania has a temperature and climate that resembles that of Europe.

While the book is well researched and includes important facts and documentation that points out how hard it is to overcome the economic challenges of being a low wage earner, this book takes the issue an important step further.  It shows, first hand, the emotional direct effects of what it is like to live the life of a struggling employee.<br />  The author researched this book by living the life of a divorced woman attempting to reenter the workplace after decades of no employment.  While she had a personal financial security net and much work experience, she hid her experiences and sought not to use her safety net.<br />  The pressures and frustrations facing so many people struggling just to keep their heads over water is described.  We follow the author as she hunts for jobs, works long hours in difficult jobs, and then tries to manage living on her paychecks.  Readers learn how difficult life is for so many Americans.<br />  Life on low wages is difficult.  If one does not have the money to make a deposit, one cannot cook meals.  This means food is likely going to be more costly, which in turn makes it more difficult to save for a room.  Further, health care is usually a dream for most low wage earners.  Yet, prescription drugs and medical care are more expensive for people without insurance, which again makes it more difficult to break out of the low wage cycle.<br />  Stress is a major part of low income employment.  The author describes how employers of low income workers, perhaps knowing most will not remain with them long and definitely aware they can easily be replaced, attempt to get as much work as possible as they can out of employees while they have them.  This makes life difficult for low income employees.  This matches data showing that work-related injuries and illnesses have risen sharply over the past two decades.<br />  Almost 30% of Americans earned, in 1998, $8 an hour or less.  Yet it took an average hourly wage of $8.89 or more to afford a typical one bedroom apartment.  The author found she could save $500 a month for rent when it cost $675 go afford trailer rental.

Recently discovered documents, unseen for centuries, allow the author to more fully describe Franklin's critical role as a diplomat.  This is a thorough biography that shows us the many sides of Franklin: as politician, as Scientist, as inventor, and as a most important figure in the creation of our nation.<br />  Franklin was an early proponent of unifying the colonies, even advocating such before others considered uniting for purposes of independence from England.  Franklin advocated creating a Governor General for all British colonies who could lead a unified colonial defense and attack against the French colonial army.  Yet, the idea was rejected.<br />  The book explores the many aspects of Franklin's life: such as his notable experiments with electricity that won him much respect and gratitude for publishing only facts he had proven and for describing how his results could be duplicated.  We see Franklin as one who purposely did not care if high society saw him with his illegitimate son as a fellow diplomat.  We further see his private torment as his son is imprisoned as a British loyalist, yet Franklin chose not to intercede on his son's behalf.<br />  Ben Franklin is one of the great Americans of all time.  This is a great biography of a great man.  It is highly recommended.	2002-12-27

It argues that not only is representative democracy the best option available, but that much of the criticisms of the the legislative branch is based on inaccurate perceptions.<br />  The public has become less trustful of government.  Polls show about 75% of the public during the 1960s trusted government.  In 1973, 42% of those polled had &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a bit&quot; of confidence in Congress,  In mid-2001, 26% stated that had a &quot;great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a bit&quot; of confidence in Congress.<br />  The public distaste for politics along with the mean spiritedness of campaigns discourages many capable people from even entering politics.  Further, many who do select public service as a career are finding the burdens of service are causing them to leave public careers prematurely.  The loss of dedicated public servants weakens the legislative process as well as reduces the public image of legislatures.<br />  While the public may be disillusioned with representative democracy, and while politicians may similarly have reservations, the alternatives are no better.  The authors argue that the option of Executive dominance can lead to concentrated and abused power.  The alternative of direct democracy may be cumbersomely unpractical and may be more readily manipulated by powerful interests.<br />  Negative campaign advertising is cited as a major influence in the declining appreciation and respect for politics and for government.  Political scientist Richard Fenno has found that negative campaigning is further affecting government, as candidates are elected by claiming their opposition to the institutions to which they seek eleciton and, upon election, their negativity hampers their abilities to serve in office.<br />  The authors note the very nature of legislative politics is bound to create negative public perceptions.  Most legislation that is passed reflects compromises and the mere act of compromising often leads proponents and opponents both feeling disappointed.  Legislative work thus usually wins few friends, yet it produces important results.<br />  Despite its complexities and nuances, representative democracy does work.  The legislative branch does a good job of bridging the gap between the public and policy makers.  The alternative of administrative control concentrates power too much and the alternative of direct participation is too cumbersome.  Representative democracy may not be perfect, as this book discusses, but it is the best system there is.  Readers wishing to explore these discussions will greatly appreciate this book.and the mere act of compromising often leads proponents and opponents both feeling disappointed.

It brings forth emotions while being grounded in hard facts.  Readers walk away with expanded knowledge of the events and issues facing miners of past years while reading expertly constructed storylines.<br />  This book brings vivid images of life as a Scranton coal miner a century ago.  The insensitivity of mine bosses is shown, as they were upset at mining accidents not for the sake of those injured yet because of production delays.  Further lack of feeling is shown when mine owners would pay for the removal of dead mules in mines, yet families would have to pay to bring the bodies of their dead relatives from mines.<br />  We learn a main reason why mine owners were insentivies was that it was railroad companies that owned most of the mines.  Laws passed allowed rail companies to control the transportaiton of coal.  Railrod companies gobbled up owning coal mines and refused to transport coal of competitors.  The owners of railroads were generally not sympathetic to the plight of miners.<br />  Miners suffered and they reacted.  61,000 miners died nationwide at work from 1838 through 1914.  Growing labor unreast was met with company-sponsored attackers that put down unrest and killed some miners.  Mine union members were barred from employment.  Vigilantes struck back.  Mine executives and public officials were killed.  Miners marched, and Sheriffs and deputized Sheriffs opened fire shooting and killing miners.<br />  Scranton a century ago was a city with much tension, struggles, and death.  This novel brings that Scranton of yesteryear alive.  This book about working underground is a rare gem.	2002-12-23

Readers learn of the early legislative bodies during Oregon's territorial days and the bitter partisan battles over issues such as slavery and citizenship to racial minorities.  We learn of some of the important and often amusing political characters through Oregon's legislative history as well as the effects of such measures as the poll tax and other taxes designed to harm members of racial minorities.<br />  19th century political power in Oregon rested with business leaders representing railroads, utilities, and banks.  Readers learn the interesting historical fact that Republican legislative votes were for $4,000 per legislator while Democratic legislative votes went for $3,000 per legislator.  As Republicans occupied a higher scale of living, they cost more to bribe.<br />  Still, legislative action was not a given.  One entire legislative session ended without a single bill passed.<br />  Some more recent Oregon legislative tales will amuse readers, such as the time an Oregon legislator dropped a bottle of liquid from a railroad effluent line and let the smell fill the House chambers.  In another instance, a sleeping legislator had his shoe laces tied to his desk and then was called upon by the Speaker to arise from his desk.<br />  People wishing to learn about life in a state legislature will enjoy this book.  It is good to see some people capturing these pieces of history.  If we can't learn from the past, we can at least enjoy it, as readers will from this book.	2002-07-19

We learn the abilities and limitations of tax systems that were basically designed in the 19th century and how they respond to 21st century challenges.  These are tax systems designed upon a manufacturing economy that has diminished.  Along with the devolution of Federal government programs to the states over the past two decades, state governments need to find secure revenue bases to keep state government services operational.<br />  The shifting of public services responsibility to states has awakened the corporate world.  1981 marked the first year that corporations paid more in state taxes than in Federal taxes.  Thus, corporations have increased lobbying pressures on state governments. Numerous tax breaks have been afforded to businesses by states.<br />  States find themselves pitted against each other in near-death spirals of competing against each other in offering tax breaks to attract businesses away from other states.  Unfortunately, the differences in state taxes have been found to matter little in business location decisions.<br />  State governments have become dependant more upon personal income tax revenues.  1998 marked the first year since the 1930s that revenues from personal sales taxes were greater than revenues from sales taxes.  This reflects our changing world, as tax exempt services are an increasing part of our purchases.<br />  The growth in personal income tax share of state tax revenues has been dramatic: it was 9% in 1950 and 19% in 1970 before reaching 34% in 1998.  Sales and use taxes account for almost one third and corporate income taxes account for 6% of all state tax revenues.  All state tax collections account for about 40% of what states need for their budgets.  The rest is gained through federal funds, lotteries, litigation (including the tobacco settlement), license fees, and selling unclaimed properties.<br />  This book shows would state government leaders should do to examine their taxes, reevaluate their policies, and realize where tax burdens falls.  This is an excellent book for people wishing to learn the structure of what keep state governments functional.k shows would state government leaders should do to examine their taxes, reevaluate their policies, and realize where tax burdens falls.

In addition, it provides many personal insights into the rise of a man from a working class South Boston neighborhood to legislative leadership.<br />  A primary lesson Senator Bulger wishes to convey is that politicians should be driven by their believe they can make a difference.  They should continue at politics \\"while the music lasts\\" and they can still hear that music that lets them know they can create the changes for which they fight.<br />  Mr. Bulger's advice to legislators is to learn facts and data when arguing the merits of their proposals.  He believes good research is more valuable than good rhetoric.  He recommends that legislators avoid creating divisions amongst their peers and to avoid choosing sides too soon when these divisions occur.  For that reason, he followed a rule of avoiding discussing divisions with the media, whom he believes fuels these divisions.  Senator Bulger was a practitioner of the art of compromise, although he states taht moral principle should always come first.<br />  The book provides a good description of the two year fight Senator Bulger had in passing key child care legislation.  Part of his struggle included withdrawing his name as sponsor in order to pick up votes to pass it.  The book also provides the author's insights into the very heated school busing issue.<br />  This book is a great resource for readers wishing to learn more about the legislative process, about Massachusetts politics, or the insights of a colorful politician from South Boston.	2002-05-28

Scholarly descriptions of state governments are combined with actual applications with an insider's view on how state government operates.  This is a fantastic book on state government.<br />  Of particular interests are the insights on how the New York legislature operates.  We see the divisions along political parties and the intense struggles over just 2% to 3% of the state budget.  Readers learn of the unique political powers New York legislative leaders have and how they obtain and maintain such authority.<br />  New York has a large number of local, county, and state government agencies.  Even local governments differ as they reflect various British, Dutch, New England, and Western influences.  Governance in New York is difficult to manage and understand.  This book, though, is a great guide to at least achieving comprehension of how New York is governed.	2002-01-31

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Important Study of Ignored Area	This book presents research on what types of people run for election to state legislative positions.  It is the result of interviews of legislative party leaders in half the states, surveys of legislative candidates in eight states, and personal interviews of candidates in three sates.  A primary observation of this book is that, in recent years, fewer people seek election to state legislatures.  This is interesting, as state legislatures have gained greater importance.  State legislatures have been gaining increased power over budgets and overseeing government operations.  While state legislators have gained power, the position attracts fewer candidates.<br />  It appears challengers shy away from running against these increasingly powerful incumbent legislators.  It is usually difficult to defeat an incumbent legislator.  It is costly in terms of time and finance to run campaigns.  Further, winning often is not enough incentive to run.  People usually find more financial reward, job security, and potential occupational upward mobility in other careers.  It is becoming more difficult to find people to risk their carrers to enter politics.<br />  The authors find there has been increased activity towards social and political activism.  There has been decreased participation in any type of structured activities, from being politically active, going to church, and even joining bowling leagues.<br />  So, who does run?  Just over half (52.1% according to the authors) of legislative candidates have no children at home.  Most candidates are male and Caucasian.  The largest source of candidates is those recruited by political party officials.<br />  This is a fascinating study into an area seldom examined.  It is dismaying that the public has fewer choices in voting for state legisaltive seats at times when the position's importance is increasing.  The book shows how a lack of media attention on legislative races means the public is receiving less information to make choices even when choices of candidates are presented.  This book makes solid observations based on empirical evidence.  It is an excellent study.ces even when choices of candidates are presented.

This conclusion differs from general Political Science thought that the manner in which Justices are picked for office makes little to no difference on how they ultimately decide cases.<br />  The author concludes that groups with little political and/or economic power fare best with Supreme Court Justices who are appointed.  This is important as members of these powerless groups require innovative state Supreme Court decisions to obtain remedies they have been unable to achieve from conservative leaning federal courts.  Elected state Supreme Court Justices tend to make more traditional stances and sun the innovative decisions.<br />  The book examines state Supreme Court decisions on similar issues in business law, criminal law, and family law in six states: two with elected Justices (Pennsylvania and West Virginia), two with Gubernatorial appointed Justices (New Jersey and Connecticut), and two states where legislatures select the Justices (Virginia and Rhode Island).  36 issues were chosen.  This is a statistically signficiant sample size.  Considering the multitude of decisions these courts make and the subjectiveness in comparing decisions where specific facts may vary, the argument can continue as to whether these conclusions may be broadly reached and whether these differences would occur in different times.  Still, this is a remarkable study that combines case studies and backs these studies backed with statistical evidence.  It is highly recommended to those wishing to learn more about Supreme Court decisions.	2001-12-18

While much of the book relates past events in which the author does not have direct knowledge or participation, it is fascinating to read an expose researched and written by the person who was at the top of the organization.  It is clear Colonel McKeeta deeply cares about the proper roles police should have.<br />  Colonel McKetta is especially critical of local police departments throughout Pennsylvania history.  He notes that local politicians determine police budgets, hire Police Chiefs, and decide which laws should be enacted and guide the degree to which existing laws should be enforced.  What results are highly politicized police forces that are sharply influenced by local leaders.  Unfortunately, criminals have learned to become forces within local politics and then guide police investigations and enforcement away from areas they don't want the police to notice.<br />  Decades ago, it was official state policy that PSP officers could not investigate local crimes.  Thus, gamblers and racketeers operated in parts of Pennsylvania with the local police in their pockets and without fearing the PSP.  In the 1960s, Reading, Penna. hosted the largest gambling operation east of Las Vegas, according to the author.  The PSP had its own problems, as Colonel McKetta claims several people achieved leading PSP positions with sponsorships from politicans with organized crime connections.<br />  The author describes his efforts to clean up the PSP.  By informing state legislators of his efforts, they turned deaf ears to politicans who argued for continuing to keep the PSP out of investigations in their political areas.  The PSP thus was able to make significant progress in destroying racketeering operations, according to the author.  This book provides great descriptions into how these changes were achieved.  Students of state and local politics and of Pennsylvania history should find this book exceptionally useful.ory should find this book exceptionally useful.	2001-11-28

This book presents academic interpretation of survey findings.<br />  This book explores how contrasting political information is useful in mobilizing support for candidates, yet false political information does tend to be recognized by voters for being incorrect and is rejected and leads to political backlashes against the candidate making the false statements.

When people with these medical conditions are in government custody, do we fail to properly treat them so they may overcome their difficulties?  Have we become so stuck on punishment that we have lost sight of the real goal of assisting people who need help?<br />  According to &quot;Save My Son&quot;, this is what is happening.  We have dramatically populated our prisons with people with drug addictions.  Without arguing that people who commit crimes deserved to be imprisoned, we may have gone overboard with incarcerations and ignored that addicts need treament.  Incarceration following by release without treatment neither benefits the addicts nor their future victims.<br />  &quot;Save My Son&quot; is written jointly by Mike Carona, Sheriff of Orange County, California, who has watched his jails grow with addicted inmates, and by Maralys Wills, the mother of a drug addict who is currently imprisoned.  As the book notes, 80% of incarcerated people enter with a drug addiction and, in California, over one fifth of incarcerations as are solely for drug offenses.  Yet, upon imprisonment, few prisons offer drug rehabilitation programs.  Our hesitancy to invest in prison rehabilitation may create future crimes and higher health<br />costs.<br />  Maralys Wills delivers a heart breaking first person account of an upper middle class mother who watches her son Kirk develop from a high school boy who successfully hides his drug use from his family into a full blown, paranoid addict who has trouble managing a job, a place to live, and his health, to finally becoming another criminal statistic.  Some say an addict must hit bottom before he realizes he needs to overcome his addiction.  We follow Kirk as he is seriously injured, driven to paranoia, unable to hold a job, imprisoned and released-and still has not &quot;hit bottom&quot; to overcome his addiction.  If drug addiction changes the brain functions such that the brain demands more drugs, regardless of the consequences, the consequences do nothing to change the addiction.  True rehabilitation requires the brain to totally rethink and realize what it properly needs.<br />  The book delivers stirring commentary from Sheriff Carona as he writes about his observations of prisons and of his own mother's alcoholism that eventally killed her when he was a boy.  The Sheriff recognizes the need to reach out and help people from destroying themselves and others around them.  He points out how crime continued rising despite $30 billion spending on new prisons.  Addiction is usually not solved from imprisonment; the addiction is too strong.  We are incarcerating and then releasing untreated and angrier addicts.<br />  &quot;Save My Son&quot; describes studies by criminologist Elliot Currie that show how being imprisoned both reduces and increases recidivism.  It decreases recidivism for many violent offenders yet increases recidivism for many addicts.  Prison is often where addicts learn to become even better addicts.  A better alternative for addicts, this book argues, would be intensive therapy to get addicts to successfully overcome their addiction.<br />  This book makes well founded arguments from authors with personal perspectives on the situations.

Written by comedian Richard Lewis, we learn how he has overcome three decades of alcohol and drug addiction with seven years of sobriety.  His book analyzes how youthful traumas and adult insecurities lead to anxieties, depression, alcohol, and drugs.  It was Richard Lewis's realization that his lifestyle was leading towards death and that he wanted to live that enabled him to win his struggle to overcome addicitons and regain his life.<br />  Richard Lewis presents many deep personal thoughts about the pressures of youth, dating, and the entertainment worlds to present his own road to the depths of depression and alcoholism.  His description of his struggle to overcome his difficulties, which came from his own realization of his need for survival along with assistance from caring friends and his sprituality, brings encouragement to people seeking to overcome their addictions.<br />  One key point Richard Lewis makes is that addicts are screaming for help, even when they deny they need assistance.  All too often, we ignore their pleas, in part because many addicts do not know how to ask for help.  Addiction can be helped.  It may not be easy.  Ignoring the addiction is not the way to provide that help.	2001-09-16

A legislator who was devoted to such issues as increasing support for education and resisting nuclear waste in her state, she offers several lessons from her experiences.<br />  Among points to ponder presented in the book are a.) alliances can be formed around agenda items that transcend political partianship, b.) be open and honest with the press and they will trust you and treat you better in the long run, c.) recognize that not all men nor all women think alike, even though men and women may approach some issues differently, and d.) all issues are women's issues and women legislators should not feel compelled to limit themselves to matters others believe primarily concern women.<br />  The legislative infighting described in this book will interest students of South Carolina politics.  Her descriptions of many South Carolina Governors as essentially cheerleaders for the Chamber of Commerce provides insights into interest groups and government.  Legislative observers will appreciate learning how as much to one third to one half of South Carolina legislative sessions used to be spent engaging in fillibusters.<br />  Rep. Keyserling is proud of her efforts to create a dedicated sales tax for education and for creating South Carolina<br />s Sunny Day Fun.  Towards the end of her career, South Carolina politics transcended into an arena of great confrontation and tension.  Disliking these changes, she left politics.  Harriet Keyserling, though, has left us with her knowledge and insights in this book.  Readers will appreciate her writings.	2001-09-14

Indeed, at the rate the world is progressing, nuclear warfare is likely.  Can we comfortable look at crises in India-Pakistan, the Middle East, Iran-Iraq, and the two Koreas and conclude that nuclear war is impossible?  Further, should the current government in Russia fall, can we be certain its replacement will not be one that rekindles some Cold War aspects?<br />  Roger Hilsman's book is fascinating in two aspects.  It first serves as a detailed yet readable history of nuclear weapons policies.  It then presents a thoughtful yet controversial proposal on what the author argues will prevent nuclear war.<br />  Nuclear war can be started by nations or by terrorists, Hilsman warns.  Leaders can miscalculate, be insane, or lose control of situations.  During war, all three such possibilities can easily occur.<br />  Hilsman's conclusion that a world government replacing nationalistic desires (which causes most wars) and that is capable of policing rogue nuclear threats is the only solution is a conclusion bound to provoke dissension.  Indeed, even Hilsman realizes such an eventuality will be impossible for some time.  National pride is too strong for nations to give power to a higher governmental authority.  Still, the thought this is the only way to prevent a nuclear catastrophe should create concern.  If the world can recognize the dangers and begin moving in this direction (which is possible as evidenced by Europe's acceptance of the European Community), there is hope.	2001-09-14

Dr. Murphy warns that angry children turn into angry adults who then tend to have their own angry children.  Often, parents need to look at themselves and how to control their own anger to prevent continuing anger into the next generation.<br />  Parents need to determine what causes anger in their children.  There are different types of anger.  Thus, there are different ways to handle the various categories of anger.  Anger often forms along a usual route from causation through explosion.  It is important for parents to recognize what creates such anger and to learn methods to derail emotional outbursts.  A useful guide to handling different types of anger is presented.<br />  This is a good book for parents.  It will help many families find solutions to anger problems.	2001-09-14

The authors delve into recent research into brain development.  They presents their findings in a clear, understandable form.  This research is then associated with what this means to our society.  A case study, regarding a 16 year old boy who murdered an 84 year old man, weaves its way through the book so readers can relate the data to a real person.<br />  This book examines how recent studies using PET and MRI scans and other methods allow us to better understand the human brain.  Most of the crucial brain development occurs before a child reaches three years old.  During those years, the human brain is programmed to adapt to its environment.  Frontal lobe activity can be stimulated by parental involvement.  A lack of this activity can lead to lifelong depressed behavior.  What a baby is exposed to, or not exposed to, determines how the brain forms and how the brain is apt to operate for the rest of life.<br />  A child who does not find empathy by the age of three is likely to have difficulty showing empathy towards others.  A person without consideration for others has a much greater tendency to drift towards anti-social behavior such as violent crime.  A baby growing up in a withdrawn or hostile environment may begin life at a signficant disadvantage.<br />  The policy debate this creates is enormous.  &quot;Liberals&quot; may call for taking steps to see that babies' brains are properly stimulated during the critical formulative years.  Outreach programs to pregnant women and families with babies should provide information on good parenting techniques.  There should be high quality child care with programs that stimulate babies' brain developments.  Early education opportunities should reach the pre-school age.  &quot;Conservatives&quot; may call for getting families to focus more of their energies on their children.<br />  This is a fascinating book.

This book argues that female legislators have had to decide whether to conform to expectations of a male dominated institution, and thus be underminded by being viewed as less capable as male legislators, or to challenge these norms and thus possibly become outcasts.  To overcome preconceptions, some Texas female legislators suggest women should either a.) learn the political system and how things operate or b.) work to change and improve the current political system.  Some suggest creating strategies incorporating both elements.  Still, even recently, State Sen. Judith Zaffirini was advised by a Lt. Governor that &quot;if she cut her skirt off about six inches and put on some high heels, she could pass anything she wants.&quot;<br />  Texas has elected women as Governors.  Ironically, the first female Texas Governor, &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson, wife of previous Governor Jim Ferguson, was elected in 1924 with support from antisuggragists and the active opposition of many women.  Some legislators then questioned, since Texas law prevented a married woman from legally signing transactions without her husband's signature, whether she would need her husband's signature to approve legislation transferring state property to the federal government.<br />  Ann Richards was elected Governor along with the largest percentage of female legislators that had existed prior.  The book argues that more women in politics can make a difference, as the Richards Era was credited for increased attention to mental retardation facilities, crime victims' rights, protection against stalkers, reducing family violence, increasing child immunization, and other issues championed primarily by female politicians.<br />  Someday, there will be a time when a person's gender is not a significant consideration in politics.  Until that time comes, this book is a great chronicle of women in the Texas legislature., this book is a great chronicle of women in the Texas legislature.	2001-09-14

This Alan Rosenthal book examines legislative ethics.  We learn from Mr. Rosenthal's knowledgeable observations that legislators generally are honest and the legislative process is basically ethical.  Unfortunately, he warns legislators may not heed warnings that the public is demanding ethical standards higher than the ones they now set for themselves.<br />  The public historically has held skeptical views of politicians.  The past generation of political leaders, which includes those involved in Watergate as well as legislative scandals resulting in convictions in several states, has lowered public confidence in politics.  An Eagleton Institute survey found over one third of those surveyed assume over half of all legislators receive bribes.  While Alan Rosenthal believes there was more corruption amongst legislators in the historic past, increased media scrutiny and criticism of legislators have weakened the legislative image.<br />  Ironically, legislators today, compared to the 1960s, better respond to public demands, are more responsive to overseeing administrative functions and curtailing government abuses, are more independent of powerful political forces, are more competent as they have improved access to staff and information, and are more proportionally representative of the public with more women and racial minorities serving as legislators.  Alan Rosenthal argues legislators accomplish more today than in the 1960s.  Still, he warns &quot;the instituion fabric of the legislature is unraveling.&quot;<br />  When legislative scandals occur, legislative bodies often react by passing increased ethical requirements.  Unfortunately, ethics becomes a political weapon.  Challengers raise ethics issues in political elections against incumbents.  Alan Rosenthal sees these debates creating more tense divisions amongst those legislators who are elected.<br />  The climate of hostility and scrutiny is discouraging people from running for the legislature, Alan Rosenthal warns.  He further offers his opinion that some of the better legislators have left legislative careers to escape the increasingly bitter legislative climates.<br />  While Alan Rosenthal does not believe legislators are less ethical than other occupations, there is room for ethical improvements.  There have been increased prosecution of legislative improprieties.  One result of the Watergate crisis was the creation of a Public Integrity Section within the U.S. Justice Department.  Prosecutions of public officials increased ten fold.<br />  Another result of improved legislative abilities and increased legislative attention is more outside concerns are being impacted by legislative actions.  The late 1980s saw a 20% increase in the number of lobbyists.  Increased lobbying enhances opportunities for more illegal legislative lobbying activities.<br />  Legislators are not blameless for their ethical lapses, Alan Rosenthal scolds.  Some legislators have developed an arrogant disregard for the proper use of power.  Some less powerful legislators have been convicted for accepting bribes of as small as $400, not because they needed the money yet because they wanted the feel that someone else thought they were powerful and influential.  Legislators need to retain their sense of propriety.<br />  Alan Rosenthal believes it is very important that legislators follow ethical standards.  He observes that legislators place their own values and their constituents' values before those of contributors.  On the other hand, he warns that legislators who argue contributions have no effect on them live in denial.  Contributors are apt to receive greater attention.<br />  This is another book of fascinating observations from Alan Rosenthal.  The strength of his personal deductions from years of studying legislators is also this book's weakness.  Little emprical evidence ispresented to back up his claims.  Still, as Alan Rosenthal practically is the only political scientist watching legislators, his experiences make him the best qualified field observer of legislators and his field guides to the legislative process are the best available.  This book is highly recommended to students of state legislatures.d to back up his claims.

Personally, I am one who believes there are too many foster care children with natural parents who will never be able to provide care. It has been my belief the sooner parental rights can be legally severed and the children legally adopted, the better. Yet, this book serves a loud alarm: we may be taking too many children away from caring parents too quickly.<br />This book shows how false reports of child abuse (in some cases, even repudiated cases as when someone makes a report in anger or in revenge) can destroy families. Children, Youth, and Families Agency case workers make determinations in matters of just hours whether to remove children from their families. While I know many case workers have excellent reputations and handle much work, this large volume of caseloads alone makes their jobs difficult. Decisions need to be made quickly, both in the event children need to be removed quickly from families and because there are so many cases to consider. It is very possible that case workers can make the wrong decisions.<br />The Dunsmores argue case workers often lack experience and training. Case workers are neither licensed nor certified and need only possess two years of college credits. These emploees, sometimes operating on anonymous tips and reports where tipsters have immunity, can decide to remove children from their homes and placed into foster case facilities. The authors find fault with these foster facilities for their own dangers. Children there are exposed to verbal and sexual abuse from fellow children as well as some staff.<br />Several chilling case studies are presented. It is alleged that case workers lie and mislead parents, misinterpret situations and judge parents on factors not related to actual abuse, and make improper assumptions. Families are torn apart and face large legal costs as well as responsibilities for paying for foster facility care. Court appointed attorneys sometimes have just minutes to prepare for legal hearings. From this suspect system, the futures of children and parents are decided. Most readers will find this an informative and chilling book.foster facility care. Court appointed attorneys sometimes have just minutes to prepare for legal hearings.

Perhaps if you are interested in learning how politicians can use large amounts of space to write very little, you may find &quot;Making Government Work&quot; insightful.  Otherwise, this book fails.<br />  The concept of the book is intriguing.  Take the most recognizable names in American state and local government, from Rudy Guiliani to Jeb Bush, and ask each to analyze their experiences in privatization.  What results is a series of glorified press releases.  This book is neither an honest presentation on the debates over privatization, as only one side is presented, nor a useful discussion of privatization.  Little meaningful insight is offered.<br />  What emerges are grandiose declarations of the need for privatization and how great the privatization programs each implemented are operating.  Very little data is presented.  We are expected to take these public official at their words they are doing great jobs.  Perhaps some of their programs have been successful.  Yet the lack of honest evaluation makes their claims suspicious.<br />  This book argues that privatization is needed to counter the recent large growth in state and local governments.  Yet, instead of analyzing why this growth occurred, the book immediately concludes this growth is out of control and needs to be curbed.  Perhaps some growth is excessive.  A more proper analysis would observe a.) the Federal government's recent devolution has transferred more responsibilites from the Federal government to state and local government, something, incidentally, most state and local government officials heralded at the time and b.) government has become more proactive in recent years in providing public services, from increased police protection to improving education, something the pubilc heralded at the time.  To ask for growth and then recoil in shock when we realize growth has occurred is contradictory.  To assume all this growth has been wrong is incorrect, unless you have a liberatarian ideology.  What would have been more useful would have been to examine this growth and try to determine which is proper and which is wasteful.<br />  Many of the writers in this book state public managers should look at government as if it were a business.  Yet, business managers need to think in terms of managerial objectives such as maximizing profit rather than providing quality public goods.  If public managers operate with bottom line considerations, financial considerations can lead to employee layoffs, decreased employee morale, and reduced public services.  The business-like objectives may be met, but the initial purposes of the public services may be defeated.<br />  With early data on prizatizion conflicting, this book is noted as a good collection of what public executives approving of privatization think.  Beyond that, though, this book has little more to offer.wth has occurred is contradictory.  To assume all this growth has been wrong is incorrect, unless you have a liberatarian ideology.

Harriet Woods presents her insights into the changes she has witnessed over past decades.  Particular insights are presented on changes in how the public regards women in politics.<br />  It was only three decades ago when few were concerned with how the majority of women felt on issues, according to Ms. Woods.  Few women existed in such professional occupations as physician and attorney.  (In 1960, 95% of law degrees were awarded to men.  Today, about one third of law school graduates are female.)  The use of contraceptives then was a crime.  The term &quot;domestic violence&quot; had yet to enter our collective vocabulary.  Readers unfamiliar with this past will marvel as they read how far women, as a group, have advanced in some (but definitely not all) areas within one generation.<br />  These times are described along with the career of Harriet Woods.  Entering politics over public inattentiveness to her complaints over a loose manhole, Harriet Woods continued her activism when appointed to a City Council vacancy.  From there, she was elected to the Missouri State Senate in 1976, served as Lt. Governor, and then led the National Womens Political Caucus.<br />  Harriet Woods did not at first want to be identified as a<br />&quot;women's issues&quot; politician.  She soon learned there was a substantial need for her to advocate women's issues.  Fortunately she also was able to make her mark in others areas, such as drafting and passing model nursing home reform legislation.<br />  The 1960s opened new discussions regarding the status of women, Harriet Woods writes.  More women entered politics.  Even today, though, very few women with small children are politically active.  Harriet Woods notes that 85% of female office holders are over 40 years in age.  By comparison, 28% of male office holders are age 40 or younger.<br />  The role of women in politics has changed dramatically in Harriet Woods's lifetime.  This book is an excellent record of those changes written by someone who both observed and participated in these changes.ges written by someone who both observed and participated in these changes.	2001-09-12

Being a Republican Senator, he obviously was in close proximity to humorous material.<br />  The book informs us that political humor stretches back thousands of years.  Emperor Augustus, when apprised of a foreigner who looked just like him, ordered the visitor brought to him.  Augustus asked whether the stranger's mother had even been to Rome.  &quot;No&quot;, replied the guest, &quot;but my father was.&quot;<br />  Great political lessons can be learned from ancient political stories.  During an election in Athens two thousands years ago, a political candidate made a lengthy presentation.  His opponent, the ultimate victor, responded simply with &quot;all that my opponent has said, I will do.&quot;<br />  Learn to be careful of what you say.  A state legislator who told voters of the accidents the Highway Patron has prevented was met with a voter who then queried &quot;alright, name one.&quot;<br />  Public officials should not expect respect even after they leave office. A preacher once proclaimed at a funeral &quot;the corpse has represented this district in Congress for 20 years.&quot;<br />  This is a good compliation of political humor.  What was politically humorous years ago remains funny today.  Among the observations that upholds over time is a person who throws the bull in Spain is called a matador, and in America that person is called a Senator.  The book holds up over time, even if it was compiled by someone who earned his living throwing the bull American style.	2001-09-12

The book, &quot;Willie Brown&quot;, presents a study of a man's contrasts and complexities.<br />  This biography neither glorifies nor lambastes its subject.  The reader is allowed to thoroughly understand the gray areas between the good and evil which is the human nature of most public figures.  We learn about Willie Brown and the events shaping his life and histroy.<br />  We learn that Willie Brown sought being the center of attention from childhoold and how this trait was internalized through lifelong quests for leadership.  Willie Brown emerged from a life of gambling and nightlife into a life or politics and nightlife.<br />  Controversy has followed Willie Brown's life.  Branded as both a radical liberal and a conservative coalition builder, Willie Brown has learned that power and personal feelings can change and that these changes can be used for advantage.  Readers learn how Willie Brown, upon becoming Speaker of the California House of Representatives, was adept at maintaining power.<br />  The author demonstrates that Willie Brown enjoyed political power games more for the sake of power than for setting policy.  Willie Brown played the legislative power game very well for a long time.  When he finally lost the power game, he exited the legislature by becoming a big city Mayor.  This book presents a remarkable study of one of America's most resilient politicians.	2001-09-12

This book combines philosophical discussions with actual issues and then draws its own conclusions.  Whether one agrees or not with the author's opinions, this book definitely creates spirited debate.<br />  The author, Amitai Etzioni, is a leading proponent of the commutarian viewpoint.  Commutarians argue that policies should consider what is best for the community while simultaneoulsy attempting to protect privacy rights.  A balance needs to be established between these two goals as they often are in conflict.  Amitai Etzioni argues that individual rights should be protected except when such preservation presents a clear threat to the community welfare.<br />  The author claims in this book there are public safety and health concerns which are adversely affected by attempts to defend personal privacy rights.  Etzioni argues these concerns should be evaluated according to their moral, legal, and social aspects.  In this book, the common good wins out over privacy issues in most of the issues presented, namly universal identification, Megan's law, testing infants for HIV, and encryption for online privacy.  On examining the issue of the privacy of medical records, the author sides with the advocates of individual privacy versus the community welfare.<br />  The prescription for policy analysis, as presented by the author, is that privacy concerns should be considered first with policies restricting such persoanl privacy being accomplished with as minimal intrusion as possible.  Crtics will argue the author seems to readily advocate proceeding with such intrusions.<br />  Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with each conclusion, most readers should find this an insightful book with coherent yet controversial arguments.  It will spark much rich debate.	2001-09-12

Ian McHarg minces no words.  He recalls the incident where he gave public testimony claiming that highway engineers seem to &quot;have a deep insecurity as to their masculinity which can only be appeased by mutilating nature&quot;, among other similar ventures.<br />  This autobiography informs us how a person of such outspokenness has emerged and gained respect.  His childhood outside Glasgow, Scotland at the city's edge where homes met nature made him realize, at an early age, the advantages of an environment outside of blocks of treeless tenement homes.  Possessing neither an undergraduate degree nor a high school diploma, he entered Harvard's graduate program in Landscape Architecture by telegraphing them and requesting that arrangements be made for his arrival and entrance into their school.  He repaid his department by becoming Student Council Chairman and pushing through a resolution of no confidence in his department.  Upset that the Landscape Architect faculty focused on designing gardens for the wealthy, Ian McHarg became an advocate that landscape architecture is for all.  Further, he would argue, we all should respect nature.<br />  People familiar with projects where Ian McHarg had a hand will appreciate learning about his eventful life.  Among the projects where Ian McHarg was involved include Baltimore's Inner Harbor, the creation of 110 more acres in Manhattan through landfill, the first Earth Day, and his milestone book &quot;Design with Nature&quot;.  Many credit &quot;Design with Nature&quot; as a major force in creating legislation requiring ecological considerations when planning construction.<br />  People unfamiliar with Ian McHarg's work will appreciate reading of his life's struggles, from combat in World War II, fighting tuberculosis four decades ago when survival rates were much lower, and founding the Landscape Architecture program at the University of Pennsylvania with no faculty, no office, and no students.

Jon believes God speaks in clear sentences, suitable for publishing.  Before we decry either the irreverence of this book, and definitely before we divest all our assets to devoutly follow Jon's every word, we do have to wonder if Jon hears God correctly.  Especially when he writes God as stating &quot;You want to play God?  Be my guest, it's all yours.  Guaranteed, two weeks on the job, you quit from all the aggrevation.&quot;<br />  The book does provide some interesting insights into the Supreme Being.  God appears to feel He is being taken advantage of, as when He reportedly asks us &quot;Just once I'd like to have someone make a sacrifice or a burnt offering without immediately following up with a demand.  Surprise me this weekend.&quot;<br />  The book contains a bonus interview with God along with a forward from Jay Leno, for whom Jon authors jokes.  Jan Leno complains about being unable to book God for the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, a move that would guarantee a rating win that evening over Letterman and maybe even Ted Koppel.<br />  Some may be disappointed with this book's small size.

The advice is often hard to argue with, yet still important if only because this advice is good but often ignored.  This book helps in transmitting the need to consider options of paths in improving our lives.  &quot;Who Moved My Cheese&quot; tells a parable about how mice, accustomed to conquering a maze where cheese is hidden become so adapted to the routine path, even reorganizing their lives around this path, fall apart when the cheese location is moved.  The morale of the story is we must learn to adapt to change.  Indeed, especially in these vibrant times, we must prepare for the inevitability of change, recognize when important elements are changing, and properly react to these changes.  This book aptly describes common sense without prescribing specific techniques.  To the degree many have forgotten coomon sense, this book serves to remind us and wake us to realizing that common sense should prevail.	2001-06-28

With people like Arlen Specter in government, who can blame them? This is a politician who has spent a career carefully taking the political center in most controversies, except the Kennedy assassination (where he is a leading defender of the single assassin theory).  One cannot help but realize that Mr. Specter must have spent a career facing constituents expressing disappointment and distrust.  By his own admission, Arlen Specter sees himself as a political moderate who won admiration from the liberal spectrum for opposing Robert Bork for the Supreme Court and then won admiration from the conservative spectrum for supporting Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court.  Political activists can count on Arlen Specter to be with them half the time.  Readers will see a politician driven by ambition.  This may explain his ability to pick and choose ideology at will.  Many political autobiographies announce a startling revelation to provoke sales.  The great secret exposed in this book is the physician who performed the autopsy of John Kennedy burned his notes because he didn't wish to see them someday crassly displayed in a museum.  In case you were losing sleep on this great mystery, now you know.  This book doesn't offer any more great new gems.  Instead, the reader follows Arlen Specter's life journey.  Students of politics will appreciate the many experiences detailed in this book.  The book shines when the Senator discussed his personal struggles with a brain tumor and overcoming being told, incorrectly, he had less than six weeks to live.  Overall, this is a decent book.  There are no flashy revelations.  It is a good book, with much personal insight, for political and Congressional enthusiasts.	2001-06-28

This book presents true and successful stories of how viewers banded together to demand superior television shows.  This is not the story of how groups with political agendas sought to acheive their interests.  It shows how viewers may praise quality and make their views known to the television industry so they will keep producing superior shows.  The book's descriptions of how a few outraged people made a positive difference is enlightening.  These were people upset that excellent shows such as &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;China Beach&quot; began with such low ratings that they were set for cancellation. It is remarkable to see how just a few people can organize many others to write television network executives and convince them to keep good TV shows.  It is very rewarding to see the successes of their efforts, as these shows remained for several successful seasons.  This is a great book.
