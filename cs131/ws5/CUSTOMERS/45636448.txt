I am a DH fanatic, take that into consideration while reading this review.<br /><br />Over the last few years, I've read all these books, on Dark Hunters, Were's and Dream Hunters among other things that pop up in Ms. Kenyon's world at odd moments.  Gods, goddesses, demons, (have there been leprachauns? mm not yet) daimons and oh  yeah, a really good story that will pull you into this world from the get go.<br /><br />I won't go into the ins and outs except for this.<br /><br />Danger is a DH, she died in the French Revolution, and has been a good little huntress ever since.  So, why is she being visited by this man that claims to be Ash's squire?<br /><br />Alexion is simply put, here to chew bubblegum and kick a**, and he doesn't look to have any gum in his pockets, so you do the math.<br /><br />Action packed, fun filled, snarky and fastpaced, Sins of the Night answers a lot of questions about the Head DH, Ash, but at the same time raises a lot as well.<br /><br />If you like a good strong woman lead as well as a hot alpha male one, pick up Sins of the Night.  If you are like me and already addicted well, what are you waiting for?	2005-06-29

He falls in love with his intended victim and then well, you can guess the rest.<br /><br />This book was better than the previous one, I liked the two lead characters much better.  Vlad is a scary man, but hey, the last line of the book really made me smile. I liked that it tied in to real history.  Now HE would have made a wonderful incubus.	2004-12-11

But something about Nicolai (?) draws her in, either his passion for his search or his angst, which he is full of among other things.<br /><br />There are moments of hilarity in this book when she becomes a human. She despises water, and the bathroom thing is horrible.<br /><br />For half the book she is like a victim which I didn't particularly care for. I mean she knows more about sex than anyone else in the world right?  But there is one scene in this book.  I enjoyed the next book with Theron much more.	2004-12-11

I like her writing, LKH does good sex, really good sex. She also does good ass kicking, which I admire as that seems to be harder to write than sex.  But strangely enough the best part of the book to me was Zebrowski and her doing the standard police work.  I love their banter and they way they are simply good friends.  She also does a good job of showing how Anita still feels the odd man (woman?) during most of her work with the police.<br /><br />I was happy about the closure on her relationship with certain individuals in the books (not spoiling it!!) But where are Shang, Ash, Willie, etc?  I miss those guys, some of which she didn't have sex with so I guess there was no room for in this book.<br /><br />I am waiting for the next one, and I will buy it too. Because as some of them have said this book is so so, that is fine, a so so LKH bets a damned best effort by most other authors any old day.  Thanks again Ms. Hamilton, I am looking forward to my Merry fix now.	2004-12-11

I laughed so hard at parts of this book that I had to stop reading.  Tessa is just an ordinary American woman, by ordinary, I mean she is size 18.  She is normal, sweet and funny.  That said, she is also insane.  This book had some of the nuttiest sex scenes that at the same time were so hot, my glasses steamed up. Max is the featured hunk in this book, he is a divorced father of one evilly snarky (again read normal) girl.  She is not all sweetness and light, nor is she the bad seed.<br /><br />Tessa's relationship with her grows as does her relationship with Max. I liked how at certain points in her *diary* she'd say something happened, then cut to another part and go back, it was a wild ride that may not appeal to all.  I enjoyed it, made it seem more real that way.  I love one part where she says this or that happened then oooh ooh I have to go, the hot duke is calling me!<br /><br />So, pick  up this book if you just want to laugh, and have a good time. It isn't deep lit, it isn't erotica, but they do worm their way into your heart by way of your funny bone.	2004-10-06

I am Jenn and I am a Pratchett aholic	That said, please take this review with a grain of salt. I love Discworld, I will always love it and nothing can change that.  This book made me laugh out loud a few times, and I even may have shed a small tear or two.<br /><br />The Premise is this.  Polly disguises herself as a boy to go into the army, she thinks she's doing well until a mysterious benefactor gifts her with .. a pair of socks?  She then gets a bit 'socky' as she calls it and decides that army life is for her.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues and revelations of mammoth proportions are er, revealed.  I love this book as much as I do the other 20 or so.  Grimes is in it, he is a favorite character.  I missed Vetenari though, as his mean evil self is always good in any book.<br /><br />Death makes a small cameo role, but not enough in my opinion.  Never can have too much of Death in a Discworld Novel.  He is the man, Death is. AND HE SPEAKS IN ALL CAPS.  So, with this in mind, that I am insane about this series, you can give this book a try as you will enjoy it without having read the other ones.  I do recommend them though, they are worth the effort to find them.  Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors ever. I continue to buy his books in hardcover, I can never wait until they come out in paperback.<br /><br />He writes the most zaniest characters I have ever read.  My favorite scene in this book is when the vamp goes after 'first blood' *insert Stallone sneer here*  Its good, its funny and its just plain goofy.  Give it a go.	2004-09-11

She never fails to thrill with her stories, and her characters have inspired a very large rp group to make it their mission in life to fill my email inbox with stories that enthrall just because they are in some loose way affliated with hers.  I am a total DH addict, and I am not lookin for a cure.<br />The premise of the story is that Wulf the latest of her DH's is cursed with the fact that nobody remembers him after he leaves. Only people of his bloodline do so.  There are moments of extreme hilarity involving his sole descendent by the name of Chris.  Poor guy has been pushed towards women by Wulf.  He calls him the jewish mother of DH's.  Wulf himself and his heroine, Cassandra are made for each other, even though they should be sworn enemies.  There is lots of action both physical and sexual, so be forewarned.<br />Sheri shows more of the Daimon's life in this book, making it harder to just hate them and root for the hunters. But just like in life, there are no black and white's just shades of gray.<br />Pick up this wonderful book and have a rollicking good read. I suck them up really fast and then sigh and wait impatiently until the next one comes out.  Come on NIGHT PLAY!	2004-04-23

I loved every single line.  Eleanor is a quiet, shy spinster that looks almost exactly like Madeline who is the heroine from the first book. Eleanor is Madeline's traveling companion.  Their looks are almost all they have in common however.  At least at first.  Eleanor meets Remington Knight, the man that won Madeline in a card game from her father.  From their first meeting she is fascinated by him and he by her.  She soon comes into her own as she must emulate her more bold cousin.  Her mantra throughout the book is &quot;what would Madeline do?&quot;  Until at last she can stand on her own and do exactly like she wants. The drunken scene I found particulary hilarious, with Eleanor telling about one of the duo's more interesting adventures.  Remington's reactions are sweet and funny and as it leads to a very steamy love scene, I liked it alot.  There is a villian(there always is in the best stories)but this one doesn't show up too often. But,Ms. Dodd does good romance.. and good action as well.  I love all her stories, even the ones that aren't from the Governess Bride Series. (hint, hint)  She is also a very nice lady, that cares about her fans and it shows as she gives readers exactly what they want.. MORE!!!	2003-11-29

I liked the two leading characters, the duchess that had to work as a companion and her ex fiance' were very entertaining.  I did not like some of the story, it was a little confusing at times.  But Dodd portrays her characters with more than one dimension.  Madeline's father is a twit, but he does love her.  He doesn't redeem himself in this book and it does leave some parts not finished, but in the second book, it is wrapped up satisfactorily.  Gabriel was delicious, at least I thought he was, and thier banter was exciting, it spiced up the story.  My favorite ones are when they fight like mad, because then you know the making up part will be just as passionate.  So I do recommend this book, but I am waiting IMpatiently for the next Governess Bride installment if there is to be one.	2003-11-29

Thank goodness, Mr. Green made a sequel for John Taylor.  Taylor is a supernatural detective that can find things with his third or *private eye* as he calls it.  Half hilarious half frightening but alway entertaining, this book brings back my favorite characters,  Taylor, Suzie, the bar guy, and Razor Eddie plus a host of other memorable characters I am hoping to see in the next installment sometime soon.(Please Mr. Green?)

Everyother line had me laughing out loud.  The title of my review is MY FAV line of the entire book.  I like the interaction between the Hero and his family members, and her reaction to finding out what he really is.  I also liked that he was not an all knowing all seeing powerful kind of vamp.  He was more human than any other vamp in a book I have seen.  Oh but the sex is still amazing w/him apparantly so its all right.

Well, I am a BIG  Jude fan, I have read EVERY book she has ever written, however,  I am here to tell ya,  I am not going to buy another of her books automatically.  This book promised so much, but delivered so little,  yeah Adam and Bo are missing, nothin gets resolved with that.  She doesn't get ANY information about them at all, just that her helping someone else MAY  lead her to her beloved husband.<br />That's another thing.  If he is so beloved, what in the hell is she doin lusting after another man throughout the whole book? I mean seriously, I am married, I am NOT saying that I don't look at nice looking men, but I do NOT actively lust after them.<br />I know she is supposed to be human, but sheesh, every other page? She was lookin at his butt, abs, shoulders, pecs, etc.  If she wants him so much, then jump on him and just leave Adam to his fate.  I did enjoy parts of this book but it just...stopped suddenly with nothing else happening.  Wham!!  And then the blurb about the next in the series.  And, from what I can see, it has NOTHING to do with Darci, Adam, Bo, or even Linc.  GRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2003-09-28

I got this book at a book fair for a buck so I got my money's worth of chills out of it and then some.  I don't know what that other reader is complaining about The Others and Sixth Sense for as this book was written way before those movies ever came out!! If anything they copied him.  I loved it and it gave me quite a few scary moments. Especially the pond scenes, and the last scene of the book with Mr. Ash was also chilling.

Each book concentrates on an Enforcer which is a vampire cop meaning they can kill other vampires and *shudder* eat them(yek).  I love that 2 of the enforcers and almost all the female characters are very strong and capable.  The men are no powder puffs, either mind you and this makes for plenty of sparks.<br />The only problems with the books is all the politics between enforcers, strig, vamps, companions, and dhampyrs. It can be very confusing and hopefully Ms. Sizemore will enlighten us more in future books.<br />My favorite characters are Siri, Char, Selena, and of course, Olympias.  Each is written like real women who happen to be either companions of vamps or enforcers.  Love these books and also love Ms. Sizmores's website.	2003-06-26

The only problem I have with them is that all were just too short.  I am a very fast reader and finished this book in about 1 1/2 hours.  Just kind of inhaled it I guess.  The main character Sookie goes to Jackson, MS to straighten out some trouble of her boyfriend, Vampire Bill.  Bill is not a very good boyfriend in this book and I think either Sookie will drop him and start seeing Eric or someone else that is not a vampire.  I liked that Sookie seemed to be a little tougher and meaner in this book.  She had quite a few kicka** moments throughout this book.  And I loooove The Man from Memphis, aka El.... oops, I mean Bubba!!!!!  I hope that wasn't the last of Sookie, Bill, Sam, Eric and yeah, even Pam.	2003-05-24

I did not like the previous novel ,Forever, for its corny supernatural content, but that is one of my favorite things about this new book.  I also loved all the characters.  Each one had its own endearing quirkiness.  Ford's continuing love for his dead wife was also very sweetly and realistically done and his family, hahahaaha, you know you see some of your relatives in there.<br />  That said, what is it with Ms. Deveraux's newest obsession with May/December romances between her characters?  Ford has to be at least 15 to 20 years older than Jackie.  What's up with that?  I have nothing against older man/younger woman relationships(or older women/younger men, for that matter) but jeez, 2 books in a row is just a bit much.  I love Ford Newcombe's character and Jackie's but sometimes they were just on different wavelengths because of age alone.<br />  However, the oldest character, the Devil, was wonderfully drawn by Jude.  He is sympathetically portrayed and also very creepy at the same time.  He is simply, the devil and he more than lives up to his reputation for temptation in this novel.	2003-05-04

At first it was slow going but then the action picked up.  I love this book.  It was full of richly written characters and locations that were described like a traveler's log.  I want to go to Terre d'ange, I'm pretty sure it exists, I mean nobody writes that much detail about a made-up place right?  Wrong,  Ms. Carey you are a truly gifted and imaginative writer and I highly recommend this book to any fantasy reader.

This is the 2nd book in the Keeper series.  I liked it because in reintroduced the characters from the first book without bogging them down with backfill.

The emphasis is more on the arduer(spelling?) All that really happens is finally two of the more interesting characters(I won't say who!) finally get some action.  I don't have a problem with all the sex scenes, there were only like 2 or 3 but I do have a problem with her moral hand wringing afterwards.<br />  She did what she did and can't undo it, so let's move on.  Her psuedoboss, Dolph's, attitude was one of the scariest moments of the book because it was so realistic.  At a certain point though, if I had Anita's powers, I would have cleaned his clock big time.<br />  Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't blood, guts, and gore and sex so, if you don't...then don't.  But if you do then pick this book up for a really good read.	2003-04-18

She is a very good mystery writer.  I love her books because it takes me so long to read them.  I can usally devour a book in a day or two but these books always take me at least a week and a half or so.<br />  Her writing style is similar to Anne Rice's in that it is very descriptive and minute.  She can take one moment in time and make it last 3 or 4 pages.  Some people don't like this sort of writing, calling it flowery and over descriptive but I love detailed character studies of people that show their motivations, thoughts, feelings, etc...  leading up to the showdown moment fraught with tension when Lynley and Havers almost always foil the bad(?) guys.  The only thing is, by the time you read all this about these characters, there are no black and white, bad or good, just human beings trying to get through their lives.<br />  If you want a GOOD long mystery that slowly and surely draws you into peoples lives, then pick up any of Ms. George's novels.	2003-02-15

It took me a week to finish this book and I usually read a book in 1 or 2 days.  It seemed to be a long nasty movie of the week with gross paragraphs randomly tossed in  in the attempt to make it more interesting.  It built to a very unsatisfying conclusion that was totally ridiculous in how the \\"monsters\\" were vanquished.  It also never told what they were or why these things happend to my satisfaction.  Just don't waste your time.  This the first and last book I will read by this author.	2003-01-25

I don't really like short story collections so bear that in mind when considering my review.  I LOVE  Stephen King.  He is one of the most wonderfull writers of horror, EVER!  However, this book falls a little flat.  I did like the one about Roland the the Sisters. It was way creepy.  A couple of the other stories were pretty good but most of them just seemed to be ones that weren't interesting enough to be a novel anyway so why bother with them.  I know some people like short stories but I do not.  I like to be drawn  slowly into the characters day to day lives and to be able sympathize/emphathize with them. Mr. King is one of my favorite authors because he can take everyday things, like a closet of clothes and make them some of the scariest parts of the story.  If you want a deep horror experience don't by this book. Buy Dreamcatcher or even his Roland and the Dark Tower books.  Heck even Insomnia beats this.  Sorry, Mr. King, don't send that evil clown to my house, please.	2003-01-17

Bailey/Lillian is a very likeable character much like Jude's other characters, and boy can she cook.  She is introverted and shy at first but comes into her own eventually.  I myself would not have put up with some of the things she does but hey, I'm not a romance novel heroine either.  If you want to do a little light reading go ahead and pick this up.  ...<br />That said, I have noticed that Jude's books have not been as good as usual lately, seemingly hurried and thrown together to make a story to sell.  Hope her next book is better.	2003-01-17

I have read The Others and I highly recommend it also.  This book (Once) was addictive.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Warning though there are some pretty kinky sex scenes in this book so I don't really recommend it for anybody under the age of 16 or 17.  I enjoy Mr.<br />Herberts books because they depict an ordinary or in the case of The Others disabled person, and let them do some extraordinary things.  Take away all the magic and mystical stuff in them and they are essentially just stories of the little man going against really bad people and winning.  So if you like fairies read this book, if not then read it anyway.	2003-01-17

Granny is such a badnatured evil minded old witch that in the end always triumphs over evil anyway.  I like that even tho she is the heroine in all these books, she is not a leading lady type of person.  Nanny is just the funniest dirty old man in an old woman's body that ever was.  She has about 20 kids and who knows how many grandkids. She has LIVED and it shows on her face and body.  Magrat is the wettest noodle in the pasta pot as Granny would put it.  However, she has her kicka** moments that are all the more funny because of the way she usually acts.  This book was great. Usally elves are portrayed as sweet and light.  Well, leave it to Terry to make them the opposite and still have the best time letting Granny, Nanny and co. kick butt.  I love all Terry Pratchett's books but the witch books are my favorite of all time.	2002-12-06

This book was really good when I read it about 6 or 7 years ago.

So if you are like me and read each and every Lindsey book when it comes out then make sure you don't already have it or read it before shelling out 20 bucks or so.  Other than that if you are new to this author by all means please read this book because it is good.  I can still remember Rowena and Warrick after all this time.  That is how I knew it was a reissue.  The only thing is that the first time this book came out it was a paperback.  Why reissue in hardcover?   Hmmmm.	2002-12-01

The newest Jude Deveraux novel is very different from most of her others with psychics, witches, and magic mirrors, she goes a little further in this book than in Rembrance, and Sweet Liar. Adam is a MONTGOMERY and he meets Darci the female lead character when she answers an ad.  Some of the book was a little corny with Darci being about the goofiest person ever.  She and Adam don't really have that much chemistry that I can see its like Ms. Deveraux is running out of Montgomery's to write about so she just uses one of her throw away type men.  I did enjoy the secondary storyline characters' romance though not much detail was given about this either.  Believe it or not there is not one sexy scene in this book and it does kind of drag along until a bang up finish at the end which was a little too pat and cutsie.  I thought this book was just o.k. but don't rush out and buy it just because you like this author. Darci must have used her true persuasion on me to get me to buy it.	2002-10-11

I love them both. Meridith is like a sexier, softer version of Anita Blake's character.  Also she is not as bogged down by the (sometimes) false-seeming morality of Anita.  It seems more and more silly that Anita can kill without a qualm but can't seem to get with the program about her own sexuality.<br />No such problems with Meridith, however, as she and her cadre of guards have sex throughout the whole book.  There is not just sex going on though.  She still finds time to help a fellow sidhe in the fertility department and the local police whether they want it or not.<br />I had a slight problem with how some loose ends were left hanging but I guess I'll just have to buy the next book when it comes out.  (Hurry, Hurry,please Ms. Hamilton!)	2002-09-11

It was wonderful.  Penelope has always been one of my favorite characters in the Bridgerton series because she was so ordinary.  She wasn't a raving beauty or a duchess or countess(I never knew England had that many peers of the realm anyway!) but she went to the parties and muddled through, somehow.  She was the butt of many jokes by a nasty, mean-spirited girl that I know reminded everybody of someone they knew in school. If not then YOU probably were that girl(for shame).<br />I can't say much more without giving away some major plot twists. But the Lady Whistledown mystery is solved to my everlasting satisfaction.  Yeah!,  Wow!, I knew it all the time! This is a good book and if you like all the Bridgertons as much as I do, don't pass on this latest but probably not the last installment. Thanks Julia Quinn for another enjoyable read and I guess I'll have to wait until(ulp) 2003 until the next book comes out.	2002-07-04

I paid...for a book about the apocryphal acts of the apostles and this book contains not one.  If a book says it is about something,  it should be about that subject not someone else's interpretations of it.  After reading it I found that I would have to go to the Harvard Library to see the manuscripts to go along with the book.  Do not buy this book.	2002-04-08

I have reread it about 4 times since then.  The banter between the two lead characters is the best part of the book.  She thinks he is just a foppish dandy, little does she know.....well that would spoil it for all of you.  I recommend this book, its a keeper.  Jude, hurry up and write something....I'm waiting!!!!!!	2002-01-20

This one falls into the latter category. It seemed as if the book could have been finished in about half as many pages as he wanted to drag these people all through. From the first, it oozed with a sentimental sugar coating from Agnes' pies, which by the way only served to make me very hungry while I read it. I thought it was a little far out that all these people came together to make this one person suffer. That the villian(I won't name him as it will give a way the best surprise in the book), would be so gullible as to believe the stuff he does makes him more than deserving of his just desserts in the end and I don't mean Agnes' pie either. From the Corner of His Eye reads like a Hallmark Christmas movie of the week. I did not expect something so cutsie from one of the kings of Horror!!	2001-07-15

This book did get a little bogged down in the relationship between Nefret and Ramses. I also missed David! The addition of Gargary to the team was wonderful, however, he was so funny! The middle of the book seemed to drag on forever and it was also a little shallow. I enjoyed this book but not as much as the ones previous. Peabody is getting to be a softie in her old age. What I am really waiting for is the new Barbara Micheals' novel written by the same author as all the Peabody mysteries. Please make it soon!!	2001-07-15

I love ALL Johanna Lindsey's books but my favorite was Warrior Woman.  I liked Tedra and her computer for their sassy banter back and forth.  I hope she writes another book to further explore the similarities between Tedra's world and ours.  The two main characters were alright but the best part was when Tedra came back on the scene.  I think she is one of the strongest characters that Lindsey has in her books.  Not a victim at any time to be saved by the handsome &quot;prince&quot;.  I like her a lot and hope Ms. Lindsey creates more like her.  Most of the books pages were taken up by the will she or won't she believe in the &quot;aliens&quot; world and when she does, what will she do?  I hope you like this book if you buy it.  I sure did.	2001-06-09
