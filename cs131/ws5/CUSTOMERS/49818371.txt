P.! Thorough, A Best Buy	Extremely well-written and thorough. Convincingly links the current Iraq mess to the 1979 Muslim takeover of Iran. Mondale was so frustrated by the unending domestic and foreign policy failures of the detail-obsessed Carter he considered resigning. Had the American public not been fixated on the American hostages in Iran, Carter would have lost the nomination to Kennedy (just as incumbent president Truman could not even secure renomination in 1952). Carter's mean-spiritedness and grudge-bearing (though almost always ignored by the media) is laid bare here.  <br />The author covers Carter chronologically, Carter's lack of any real political philosophy similar to W. Bush. A best buy that will bring back lots of memories for anyone over 50. For both liberals and conservatives. Buy it!	2004-08-10

The english physician who writes under the name of Jonathan Gash leaned on too many stereotypes, and yet, even a moderately good Lovejoy mystery is superior to most of the stuff out there. Those lucky enough to have watched the TV Lovejoy during its run on A&amp;E during the mid 90s, will, as a reviewer below observed, discover a much more realistic and edgy Lovejoy in print. I have read five Lovejoys, this is the weakest so far (but still worth reading).	2004-01-19

The English physician who writes under the pen name of Jonathan Gash is a potent combination of having a vast knowledge of antiques and English life. Writing in the first person, as all Lovejoy mysteries are, is challenging, yet &quot;Gash&quot; does it so well. Spend Game starts with lots of action (Lovejoy sees a friend murdered in a staged car crash) and never lags a bit. Very highly recommended.	2003-12-14

This is also a great choice for someone unfamiliar with Lovejoy as he is quickly yanked out of England and left penniless in Hong Kong.

Notable flaws are the author's assumption that the exploding latin population will assimilate into the general population as the Italians and Irish did over a century ago and help the economy (Hey Donald Coxe, check out current crisis condition of California). Another flaw is his stubborn refusal to see the current bear market as largely UNfinished and more like the Great Depression than the milder 73-74 bear. And, since he only knows how to push mutual funds (he manages one), forget about any info on options. Options and the leverage they empower the average investor with is the ONLY realistic way to make up for past market losses.

There is a word for a single man who would embrace Smalley's strange philosophy: STEPDAD. Most American women will go through 2-3 serious, live-in relationships (married or not); no one even bats an eye when a woman has children by 2 or more men these days. Smalley encourages men to be wimpy, apologetic, and hesitant. Yet, the overwhelming majority of single women mate with confident, decisive, spontaneous men. Once these confident, decisive guys have served their purpose and the woman tires of them (or the alpha male trades up to a younger or more attractive lover) *then* the guy who would folow Smalley's flawed advice would be tabbed to be the stepdad who actually has to raise the kid(s) and financially nurture the woman through her middle age years. Smalley also ignores the fact that women regard a man's financial situation as crucially important when selecting a husband.   <BR>If a man marries a truly religious woman with a conservative lifestyle, then, and only then, this book might work. A man-hating media (both magazines and esp. television) insure there are precious few women like that anymore. Increasing numbers of American women are going overseas in search of family-centered brides. When Smalley was \\"hot\\" for a brief time in the mid-90s he made the now embarrassing choice of \\"Sweatshop\\" Kathy Lee and hubby Frank Gifford (whose cheating on Kathy made tabloid headlines for months) as the ideal couple for his long-departed infomerials. Single men should search out Tom Leykis' Leykis 101 to build their dating philosophy around.	2003-05-26

Don Steele's Nonsense	This 11-year-old book should be looked upon as a great introduction to the NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) that the talented Ross Jeffries pioneered in using in one's love life. Ross is to be commended for being original and creative, far better than the elderly John White, who uses the pen name of R.

Ross has CDs and videotapes that reflect the continuing progress he has achieved as a dating guru thru the years. Washington state and just now, in 2003,California have started nailing men who live with or marry single mothers for child support, even when the child is not the new guy's offspring.

Very similar to Atkins. <BR>June 2002 Consumer Reports article grudgingly admitted that patients on a high protein diet as recommended here lost more weight without worsening their cholestrol scores, than did patients on a low fat diet (who lost very little weight).

Ali's cut man for the first Liston fight contacted his friends and relatives and told them the fight was fixed and to bet everything on Ali (this was mentioned in a casino sports betting paper in 1991). Six months after supposedly knocking out Liston with a six inch right hand, Ali could not finish off a badly injured Patterson (who foolishly went into the fight with a very bad back).<br />Liston's facial features clearly show he was around 40 when he knocked out Patterson on a brisk Chicago night in 1962. Liston was the best heavyweight for at least five years before he won the title. The powers-that-be knew a long Liston reign would just about kill off boxing, much like Evander Holyfield whose fights drew poorly unless he fought a Tyson/Foreman/Bowe. <br />Top contender Henry Cooper openly stated in a 1971 Ring magazine interview that he refused to fight Liston under any circumstances.<br />This author refuses to \\"dumb down\\" his writing, which means he wrote over the heads of most boxing fans. A local talk radio host reported there was a rumor that Liston was supposed to have thrown the Chuck Wepner fight and that he angered certain organized crime types when he did not. Wepner was manuvered into an undeserved shot at Ali in 1975. This same radio host reported that Liston was courteous and reasonably friendly in person. <br />A good book about an ignored man, hopefully someone will do one about tragic Jerry Quarry.	2002-04-24

Caes also points out how to &quot;reverse&quot; the strategy for a bull market. Enron, Lucent, JDS Uniphase, employees of these and other tech firms could have hedged their sadly misallocated 401Ks and stock options with put buying, a topic very well covered here. John Murphy's &quot;Chart Reading Made Easy&quot; an ideal companion for this book.

CBS's leftward tilt was exposed back in '68 when Walter Cronkite would deliver his opinion of the Vietnam war as fact, not as a clearly labeled editorial. The seething hatred Dan Rather showed at President Nixon at press conferences, where he would at times openly mock him, was unforgettable. In the late 80s a popular bumper sticker had the CBS eye logo and said \\"Rather Biased.\\"<BR>Still remember Rather going to my high school when race riots broke out because of forced school busing and his report basically said \\"too bad, get used to each other.\\" TV news organizations swore up and down that the Reagan vs. Carter 1980 election was too close to call, it was a Reagan landslide. In '96 they constantly reported how Clinton was 16 points ahead of Dole, he won by 7 (the amount Perot garnered). Rather was openly confrontational with the elder Bush in a early 88 interview, Bush's assertive handling of the CBS hothead catapulted him to a big New Hampshire win.<BR>If the author really wanted to bash Rather, he would have mentioned the CBS hothead's supposed mugging where his assailant supposedly repeatedly asked \\"What's the frequency, Kenneth.\\"<BR>CNN quit referring to the Sept. 11 perpetrators as \\"terrorists\\" less than a month after the horrfic attacks.<BR>Good enough for the occasional re-reading.

Most interesting part of the book is about Frazier being a one-eyed fighter. Makes sense because, outside of Foreman, Argentine Oscar Bonavena was one of the very few to ever floor Frazier and that was with relatively slow right crosses.<BR>I had the pleasure to have a long discussion with Floyd Patterson back in '87, Floyd was convinced Liston threw both fights against Ali. Patterson lost his second fight with Ali ('72) when he blew his nose which caused his slightly swelling eye to close.<BR>An interesting point not mentioned is that in Ali's 1970 comeback bout with Jerry Quarry, Ali elbowed Quarry's left eye which caused the huge cut that caused the fight to be stopped. This can be easily viewed using a VCR's freeze frame. Significant because Ali mentioned immediately after the fight that he was winded after only 3 rounds and had been hurt by a Quarry left hook to the belly.<BR>Most boxing books are superficial works written by those who have no working knowledge of the sport, not so here. Kram is a needed gadfly who presents the sport and its superstars as they really are.	2002-02-23

Once you know the basics, this book can be appreciated. Note: unless one has at least about $5000, someone should quite probably stick to buying calls or puts (which the author, the late Mr. Gross rightfully labels as an 'aggressive' strategy), depending on the market's and a stock's overall outlook.<BR>This book is at its best when used by someone with more than $5000 (and preferably more like $10,000) who can use the time-tested hedging strategies effectively detailed here. Investors on a tighter budget would likely do better with Charles Caes'\\"Tools of the Bull\\" or \\"Tools of the Bear\\" (the \\"Bear\\" book can be easily adapted to using in a bull market also). Options investors should also know some technical analysis, John Murphy's \\"Charting Made Easy\\" is a good, cost-effective source. <BR>The layout of this book is clean and makes it easy to read.

Louis and Copeland are young enough to know what works, however......the book is about 100 pages too long. And advice like pretending not to have called when she leaves her phone off the hook is baaad! Best advice here is that a man should have a fulfilling life, which leads to having a good paying job which naturally makes a man a much better catch.<BR>This book is full of ideas, one should realize that not every strategy is worth using or right for your own personality type. I suggest listening to Tom Leykis's national talk show (and check out blowmeuptom dot com), and the book &quot;A Man' Guide to Women&quot;, available just enter the name in your search engine.<BR>At least the authors do not resort to posing as women in their online group as John White (R.

At times, this easy-to-read book is interesting and contains little-known or forgotten details. In other places, the author (who served under Democratic politicians like Carter) is short on detail and insight (incompletely covering the '72 Democratic primaries, ignoring mountains of evidence and accepting Oswald as Kennedy's killer, not pointing out that Nixon's '60 VP choice was of no electoral help, and other points). <BR>Practically every other page contains a reference to how Nixon was obsessed with Kennedy. Yet the author skims over the actual vote fraud that defeated Nixon in '60 and refuses to consider how the loss itself embittered Nixon. It has been written that Clinton staffers actually had Slick Willie copying Reagan's speechmaking body language. Does that mean Clinton obsessed over Reagan? The author never considers that Nixon may have learned a lot from the '64 Johnson wipeout, and how poorly Goldwater campaigned.<BR>The personality differences between the detached Jack and the intense, grudge-bearing Bobby were mostly ignored. Absolutely no mention of how Teddy morphed into an obese alcoholic in the '80s and '90s. Teddy's interesting 1980 presidential campaign covered in only half a page. The author is a talented guy (even if his current low TV ratings had him pulled from going head-to-head with O'Reilly) who seems to lack the self-discipline to write much about what does not personally interest him. <BR>Do not use this book as one's sole guide to either man.	2001-12-16

Sy Harding's book contains stock market strategies that will prevent you from being a victim (and about 80% of investors do poorly in the market). Many investing books are written by successful and well-known market mavens yet they are often hard to read and their major points murky (Tom Dorsey's 1995 &quot;Point and Figure Charting&quot; is essentially unreadable ...). Not so here. Hardings book is very well-written and complete. It was written in 1999, he warned of a huge bear market coming. Historical perspective is given to show how old man Kennedy and others financially raped the small investor on repeated occasions ... Hardings clearcut explanation of the seasonal effect (buy around Nov 1 and sell around May 1)is noteworthy.

R. guide books (the Moon guide is the worst), however.....one still needs to pay VERY close attention to the NEGATIVE REVIEWS of resorts at the web site debbiesdominicantravel dot com. I say this because many who post on that site inexcusably downplay shoddy lodging and abusive treatment of tourists. Usually, the negative reviews are more realistic, especially of tourist traps like the Punta Cana Beach Resort (some of whose bungalows are not even weathertight). This author justifiably mentions the isolation of the East Coast (Punta Cana). Having recently traveled to both the East and North coasts, I say without hesitation the North Coast (Sosua, Puerta Plata) is far superior in every way. The Dominican Republic is a wonderful value overall and the Dominicans themselves are gentle and friendly (unless they are employed by certain resorts). I will probably retire there.

Author Pollan is pragmatic in steering individuals to avoid the &quot;wage slave&quot; trap the vast majority of us bungle our way into.  Among many noteworthy observations, Pollan wisely points out how home ownership is not the near-guaranteed money maker it once was. This book is a perfect gift for the college graduate or someone in their mid-20s. Following Pollan's advice empowers someone to be responsive to the real world of declining living standards for most of us and practically no job security. I do feel one is better buying a 3-5 year old Japanese car and keeping it 10 years while Pollan recommends continously leasing new cars.  This book is an overlooked gem that deserves the occasional re-reading.	2000-12-24

This book also shows how you are verbally manipulated  by others and how to effectively respond back. Sutphen's chapter on body  language is BETTER than most books that are totally devoted to the subject.  Chapters on the 11 human rights and the 9 manipulation traps are must-reads  for everyone. Sutphen's masterful ability to  communicate powerful points  and strategies in rather few words is highlighted in this book.	2000-07-30

Don Steele). Before purchasing any of White/Steele's books, check out his  interview in the Jan. 6, 2000 online issue of LA New Times magazine.  Steele's How to Date Young Women series downplays a fundamental truth many  relationship authorities of both sexes agree on: women marry and mate for  power and resources. White/Steele took SIX weeks to ask out the woman who  is his current wife. Plus he steers readers towards lesser-attractive  women. Writing and editing are surprisingly crude, his limited number of  observations are constantly repeated. This stuff might've worked when  Carter was President, too many more-modern works available here at  Amazon.com. Do check out White's interview.	2000-07-30
