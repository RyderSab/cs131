Each chapter is a two page spread, with the small illustrations and the words wrapped around the large illustration, horseshoe shape.  With the Oxford Picture Dictionary for the Content Areas, the large illustration is an entire page opposite the page for the small illustrations and the words.  With the Express Picture Dictionary for Young Learners, the large illustrations are top and center.  This means the book's binding goes through the middle of the large illustrations.  It's a bit awkward, but it works.  Most of the illustrations are action oriented.  The illustrations in many visual dictionaries are loose and blurry.  These illustrations are tight and clear.  More verbs than the average visual dictionary.  Plenty of rhymes.  Several chapters have subcategories, always an effective strategy with vocabulary books.  The activity book is large, colorful, inviting, and fun.  Both the picture dictionary and the activity book have a vocabulary index.

But this takes the prize so far.   <br /> <br />From the author's letter to teachers: <br /> <br />\\"For years, teachers have been asking me to write a version of my intermediate level book, Clear Speech, that would be usable for beginners.  They said that it would make more sense to help students with pronunciation early, rather than wait until they have developed habits that are hard to overcome.  Also, teachers often found that their beginning students became discouraged when people didn't understand what they were saying, and of course, a discouraged student is harder to teach.  Teachers who were trying to help their beginning students with pronunciation expressed frustration with the limited results they were getting from traditional methods of drilling minimal pair (e.g., ship/sheep) or asking students to \\"sound out\\" the letters in print.  [ e.g. \\"Do you want to go to the store? / Doo yoo wahnt too goh too thuh stor?\\" ]  They were asking for a more effective approach. <br /> <br />All of this made sense to me.  But the problems was that I just couldn't think of an approach that would work.  For one thing, beginners simply don't have enough vocabulary to understand explanations.  And with so much else to learn, there isn't much class time for pronunciation.  One thing was clear to me:  A really useful book had to be radically different from any other in the field, including my own intermediate level book.\\" <br /> <br />The author has succeeded beyond everyone's expectations.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-30

Vowels are paired according to their spelling, not their potential for being confused with one another.  Consonants are paired mainly where they share the same place of articulation.  The units were not organized as minimal pairs for two reasons:  - Any sound can form a minimal pair with a number of other sounds, not just one.  Organising units according to minimal pairs would therefore lead to a huge number of units and a lot of duplication.  - Many minimal pairs will be redundant for any given learner, so learners need to be selective.  Potentially confusing minimal pairs are gathered together in Section D4, Sound Pairs.  Learners are encouraged to select from these according to their own needs.&quot;<br />Southern British accent.  The appendix includes a list of useful and dispensable units for 26 languages<br />For extensive minimum pair work, see Pronunciation Contrasts in English, by Don and Alleen Nilsen, Waveland Press.	2005-04-27

When I heard him say &quot;textbooks,&quot; I understood. <br />No, he wasn't saying 'books.'  He was TRYING to say 'books.'  What he was saying was 'box.'

The conjugation is above the headwords, in bold, and unabbreviated.  Sentence examples and additional conjugation are marked. Sentence examples are in italics and unabbreviated.  The most common words in the English language are marked according to frequency.  Headwords, numbers, and side notes are in blue.  Special sections for phrases are lengthy.  British English versus American English is highlighted.  One refreshingly different and very useful feature is highlighted verb versus noun pronunciation.  Usages  -  \\"can\\" as a verb versus \\"can\\" as a noun  -  are marked with boxed numbers.   Usages within usages  -  the verb \\"can\\" meaning ability versus the verb \\"can\\" meaning permission  -  are marked by boxed numbers.  The editors use what they call pragmatics labels in the side notes:  approval, disapproval, emphasis, feelings, formula, politeness, vagueness. <br /> <br />The introduction says of the side notes, \\"The information is coded for brevity, and every effort has been made to keep the coding clear and easily memorable.  This edition makes the Extra Column even easier to use.\\"  I dissent.  Because the side notes are in a special column instead of buried within the definition, they are easier to FIND.  But because they are coded, they are no easier to USE.\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps the best advantage of this dictionary is that explanations are substituted for definitions.  When one of my students asks me for help with an unfamiliar word, I don't quote a dictionary definition.  I simply explain what the word means.  Then I use the word in a sentence.  Then I provide some insights through grammar and culture.  That is the same strategy other teachers use, and that is the same strategy Collins/Cobuild uses. <br /> <br />Collins/Cobuild uses it's Bank of English, a massive collection of material compiled from British and American culture since 1990.  The Bank, as well as computer software, help lexicographers  1) determine the order in which words are listed, ie, in order of frequency use  2) explain what the words mean and how they are used  3) choose the best sentence examples. <br /> <br />Most of the 75.000 sentence examples come from the Bank, which means they are direct quotes.  When a student asks a teacher for help with vocabulary, the teacher doesn't have the advantage of being able to research and quote the literature of the day.  They have to use, on the spot, their own knowledge of the English language.  However extensive that knowledge might be, it is no match for an on-screen corpus combined with computer technology. <br /> <br />	2005-04-27

At first glance, the illustrative technique makes the illustrations look cluttered.  But the system doesn't take long to learn and is easy to use.<br />From the introduction:<br />&quot;It is emphasized that the speakers you will hear will be participants involved in some communicative event, that is to say, they  will be saying something that they think is of interest or importance to someone else.  They will not be providing model sentences or lists of words for you to imitate.  And your own aim will be to take part as effectively as you can in similar events in which you have your own ideas to communicate.  You will not be satisfied with simply demonstrating that you have mastered an awkward vowel sound or a difficult sequence of consonant sounds.  If the course is to be useful, at your level of competence, the emphasis must necessarily be upon communicative use rather than upon demonstration.<br />It is for this last reason that the course differs in the way it is organized from most others that are concerned with pronunciation.  It makes its first objective an increased awareness of how the intonation system of English is used.  This can only be done if we assume that language is being used to communicate, for intonation is the means whereby we organize our language into patterns that fit the present communicative need.<br />Part 1 of the first unit is concerned, therefore, with how speech is presented by the speaker, not as separate words, but as tone units.  Tone units are the building blocks out of which all spoken communication is constructed.  Thereafter, work in intonation is introduced unit by unit alongside work on individual on individual 'sounds' (the vowel and consonant 'segments' of traditional pronunciation practice).<br />There is one very straightforward reason for doing this:  in the speech of advanced learners, departures from what we regard as desirable are said to be more often matters of intonation than matters of how particular sounds are made.  There is more to it than this, however.   If we want to focus upon the individual 'sounds' of a language, and to do so usefully, we must take account of what happens to them when the language is used to communicate.  This really means being aware of how such sounds are affected by the intonational shape of the stretch of speech they occur in.  And this in turn means focusing on the tone units that we find in any sample of used language.<br />Intonation is not, on the whole, popular among language teachers or learners.  By giving it so central a place in the course, we may seem to making things harder rather than easier.  Intonation has a reputation for being difficult and 'slippery.'  It is true that people tend easily to lose confidence in their ability to get to grips with it. The truth may well be, however, that this is precisely because it has not been given a very prominent place in most teaching procedures.  Through being left out, it has acquired the kind of mystery that so often surrounds things that we think are beyond our understanding.  And mystification about something so fundamental to spoken communication as intonation is clearly not a good thing!  Being aware that there is a whole area of the language you know next to nothing about hardly makes for self-confidence.  This is particularly true when your told  -  as you probably have been told at some time  -  that intonation is immensely important!  And building self-confidence is central to the aims of this cour.&quot;<br />Also from the introduction:  &quot;The course is intended to be worked through one unit at a time and in the given order.  This is because each unit provides information that you will need in later units.''	2005-04-27

The artists are even more talented than the authors.  The illustrations are vivid, easy to understand, and closely match the words.  When I was in Korea, I spent a lot of time in the Kim &amp; Johnson bookstore.  I saw a lot of good phonics books on the shelf, but Word by Word Primary Phonics Picture Dictionary is in a class by itself.<br />Shu Ping<BR>ESL Book Review	2004-01-14
