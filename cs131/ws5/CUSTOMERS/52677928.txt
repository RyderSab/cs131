As the cover page would tell, the pictures in there are really spectacular, making one wonder how they were even captured on paper! The variety is also varied enough to keep you interested - rather than yawning at the 203rd crater. From hellish looking magma swirling in a dark pitless crater, to crater lakes surrounded by uncountable flamingoes, to mystical colored sulphur pools and to \\"oogly\\" mud volcanoes, one HAS to stop and ponder the awesomeness of the Creator of these. I particularly like the accounts about real historical eruptions, though there are other really curious stories about how various cultures respond to the volcanic world. The only shortcoming is that the book is too heavy! Frankly, the pictures could have been a teeny weeny bit sharper, but they really ain't \\"that\\" bad.	2004-07-09

I really enjoyed the systematic approach he applies in the discussion of Global Warming, the delicate inter relationship that marries the climate and human activities and preventive measures.<br />However, one huge drawback of this book that now seems to beg you to buy it is the lack of detailed Geographical analyses of mechanisms of the weather machine and their causes. The author tends to gloss over the details (which may be a good thing for some) but offers many examples to support his statements.<br />What I find particularly refreshing is the section on weather lore. To cite one example, the old saying that when dew appears rain will not come, actually arises from the lack of cloud cover. Comprehensive and light hearted talk about the weather. Thumbs up.	2003-05-29

That's why I say it's right to the detail!<br />Like all Frommer's books, the author starts with his recommendations - best vacations, best hotels, best eateries, best sights etc etc - with regards to the region in question (in this case YST &amp; GRT). And it's really not about pure reporting the facts, but personal opinions that encourage rather than dictate your own opinion-forming process. <br />Other useful information includes month-by-month temperature information, road closures, where to get money, ATM machines etc, and, my favorite of all, When-to-go guide. There's even a section that talks about towns and cities bordering Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Parks, though they are not part of the region proper! <br />As we go deeper, the book will further the divide the regions into smaller sub-regions, such as Old Faithful Area, Norris Jct Area and Jackson Hole. You want to know which town really suits you and will make your vacation a memorable one. There's even a map showing which town is nearest to which attractions. For example if you love the Old Faithful, you won't want to fly into Jackson Hole; or if you wanna river raft in the Snake River, Cody is not the right place to reside during your stay!<br />By the look of how much I know as mentioned above, you know how good the book is! ;O)	2003-02-19

Even though many, such as the Delicate Arch, are very well-photographed, the lively colors seem to want you to pay attention to the pictures again. For example, Delicate Arch was taken with a backdrop of a brewing thunderstorm. Due to the presence of other comparable features behind or near the main focus, one will be kept intrigued, truly appreciating the sheer size of each of the features and marveling at the wonderful hand of God.<br />The captions are informative, and I would say, rather detailed - so much so they can pass for simple Geographic text. Some even add a sense of humor, describing huge corestones on the Bowling Balls Beach to have &quot;roll[ed] over to join its companion&quot;.<br />My only complaint is that there are too few photos. There should be more on Grand Canyon, and other beautiful features not covered such as Big Horn Canyon, Gates of the Mountains, Yosemite Falls, Crater Lake, Shoshone in Wyoming and Niagara Falls, whose histories can be equally alluring.	2003-02-19

Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Paradigm Shift	Philip Yancey offers a very different, yet deeply provocative dimension to the problem of pain. It isn't the kind of book that one would expect give a direct answer to the question the title of the book poses: Where is God when it most hurt? When the world seems to be crashing down? When loneliness creeps in like a sinister fiend?<br /><BR>Yancey doesn't dispute the notion of a good God, but he used painful examples of admirable and make-you-take-your-hats-off real life figures, from Olympic star to Holocaust victim, to dispel the notion that God is absent in times of fear and despondency. It is quite apparent in such times God tends to change and mould a person. <br /><BR>Though many do not like the message of pain, but Yancey has given a very honest, real and undismissive acknowledgement of the sufferings of this world. It is easy to wish away all pain, and look to God for a convenient escape, but pain seems to persist stubbornly. Pain that can change if we allow it, pain that has value and created for the purpose of alarming the body, mind and spirit of danger. <br /><BR>In conclusion, I feel this book has answered the first question in a very oblique and ambiguous manner. Where is God when it hurts? Well, He's in it, but it really matters what you choose to allow Him to do/to do yourself. <br /><BR>(I feel especially touched about examples of thankfulness, of praise, of resolve in times of pain. I thought you might also complement this with C. S. Lewis's A Grief Observed & The Problem of Pain - He debates about God's goodness and God's ability to use pain as an instrument of revelation)	2002-06-17

The story seemed promising to me initially when Grisham introduced the Judge's summons (for the &quot;appropriation of his estates&quot; immediately in the first chapter. No wishy washy background painting through laborious description, but artfully done as the pages turn, in between events. I thought that Grisham has made a deliberate effort to create this atmosphere of suspense when the Judge died suddenly and US$3 million was uncovered almost simultaneously in the study (I thought it was a little unrealistically easy to uncover US$3 m). Though it sets you in the mood in anticipation of some great story, this later evolved into a lazy elimination game of who was threatening the safety of Ray (The Judge's first son) because he took the money, in which game the reader has to keep guessing among the few characters with the help of weak clues and unexciting links - e.g. the arson of a private jet, a series of photographs of Chaney's where the money was hidden. The perpetrator was however surprisingly unpredicted (at first, I may say), but even that, the chagrin is quite mild, if not insignificant. The open ended conclusion was a further let down. A simple read, and briefly compiled for the enjoyment of a summer holidays' vacationer. Not a typical thriller.	2002-03-29
US	52677928	R1GLW2918VXCCW	0060652381	453295478	A Grief Observed	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Thought provoking...	In the last book he'd ever write, C. S. Lewis showed a break from his usual encouraging and light-hearted discussions about Christianity in topical essays and fantasy (See The Chronicles of Narnia). A Grief Observed is compiled in the form of a diary, in which much thought and spirit had been commited, evident in the patient development of ideas over the span of days he was grieving his wife's death. <br /><BR>I feel it is less an inspirational book than a self-assessment book, for Lewis highlighted a few doubtful questions he had and which he believed everyone should have asked instead of being ignorant or in staunch denial. Controversial questions on God's goodness, His realness and the reasons of [some] sufferings are raised, not to stumble [the reader] but paradoxically uplift. <BR><br /><BR>Interestingly, after reading this book, I wanted to know why we have hope in God, why we rejoice in His goodness which when asked about, we can only answer mindlessly with meaningless and bland model answers. Surely a Christian life demands a deeper realm of understanding and intimacy of/with God. Lewis depicted that maturity in his writing, through his boldness to admit his disappointments, his grief - which a Christian shouldn't be deprived of just because he believes in the hope of Heaven - and his doubts. <BR><br /><BR>It is not a long piece of literature, nor did it explore all kinds of suffering but only parochially death. Despite that, Lewis had produced yet one of the most honest accounts in the Christian context, about his love for his wife, his faith [which before was a card castle ever so vulnerable], and God's good intention in everything He does. Even in suffering. Even in physical pain. Listen and probably what you hear is not the slam of a door and bolting locks, but a voice that will tell you to continue trusting and be at peace.<BR><br /><BR>My salute to one of the most gifted and [Christian-wise] well versed writers.	2002-03-02

I would recommend the Official Biogaphy or My Story, My Dream for someone who wants to learn more about Cline Dion. There are a few pictures printed on glossy paper, but I feel are too small.

And he was not wrong to say that.<BR><BR><BR>Pictures range from the attack itself, in the first few introductory pages, to America's mourning, all emotionally riveting and eerily haunting of 'the' day of infamy. <BR><BR><BR>As if the sharply snapped photos are not enough to evoke hurting feelings, captions and accounts accompany almost every picture (in a funny electronic-calculator-font) to guide the reader through each hour that passed from the morning of Sept 11. <BR><BR><BR>Besides that, I appreciate the way the photographers take one into the surrounding buildings (e.g. WFC2) and the way perspective is given by the numerous heartwrenching portraits of the WTC towers (on fire) from the streets, from another building, from the Brooklyn Bridge and almost any other possible aspects. <BR><BR><BR>Understandably, pictures of the attacks itself are in paucity. (well, who could anticipate?). A comprehensive tribute, only too grim and dismal. Writer could have included essays by the public that could make the book seem a little more than a hopeless history account... It's not supposed to be so.	2001-12-31

It has so inspired and blessed me!  <BR><BR><BR>Traveling Light is based on the old (and one of the most famous Psalms) Psalm (23) by David the King. Lucado guides the reader with such tenderness, light-heartedness (and I mean it... You won't believe how quirky and witty he can get *Grin*) and insight into the very heart of the Psalm and God, eventually. <BR><BR>I enjoy thoroughly the way Lucado writes about his personal encounters as well as draws experience from others (from his wife to Moses) to illustrate each topical aspect of the Psalm. And it really helps you to see the big picture about vital life lessons such as pride, want and fear. <BR><BR>Apart from that, each topic is supported by reading references and questions that challenge you to probe further until you get a satisfactory answer for yourself! His intuition to human needs is amazing: Lucado is able to ask questions which I have long wanted to ask, and gives answers in his writing.<BR><BR><BR>It's a brilliant book. What more can you ask for if a Psalm barely filling up a third of a page in a typical Bible is turned into sort of a guidebook comprising 220 pages? Truly, God must be in this writing. And if Max ever gets to read this book review, I'd like to thank him... For his modest sharing :o)	2001-12-31

I think 25 pages would be an overstatement! It is too thin for one to truely grasp the beauty of those 2 towers. The many pictures, I found, are so similar, taken from the sea from different distances and at different angles. It's too boring for one would have familiarised with the New York skyline within the first 6 pages. However, the pictures are clear and taken on days suitable for postcard-pictures, if you know what I mean. A mediocre book, buy it only if you want to vaguely remind yourself of the 2 towers and their pre-eminence in Lower Mahattan or if you have never seen the towers before.	2001-12-09

I was thinking, when I saw the title of this book, that the couple was about to deny there's even Christmas or something, only to later discover that Grisham purposed the couple to merely go on a holiday.<br /><br />Pretty much an American culture to stay home, throw parties and go to attend Church services for Christmases. Here in Singapore, there's a totally different perspective; people in fact deliberately go on a vacation on Christmas! Thanks to this book, I have got closer to the American culture.br&gt;<br />Unlike other Grisham novels (and thrillers), which are usually about law, legislation and ligitious America, he seems to have become a little more humorous and homely here. Characters are fashioned to interact in such a close-to-the-heart manner, which easily compels a reader to believe in this story (besides notion that skipping-Christmas-is-wrong bit).<br /><br />Not a typical page turner though, and the I would say that the climax of the story is pretty gentle and not at all dramatic as one would expect a Grisham story to be so.<br /><br />One great regret: The book is paced real slow, almost to a crawl in the first 100 pages when similar anecdotal episodes in the lives of the Kranks get repeated umpteenth time, and bound to drive everyone to sleep with a not-again complaint. But the story picks up pretty well at the end, and pretty unpredictable too.<br /><br />If you think of buying this this Christmas for someone contemplating to skip Christmas 2001, attach a personal note to it and it might be a little more effective. Christmas is never too often, and you would appreciate it if you live in Singapore where Christmases are in actual fact a shopping festival. :o(	2001-11-14

I never fail to be surprised by Sparks' obvious talent in taking everyday life of other people into a reader's heart. The story talks about the wrestle guilt is fighting with fear. Very compelling and powerfully portrayed, I thought. If you think this book is just another silly romance story, you can't be more wrong. Sparks masterfully weaves in a little bit of irksome suspense that pushes you on to finish the book, though I thought it was overdone in the first half of the book... The suspense was excruciating, that's why I take off a star. Very recommendable read, though I believe Sparks' fans prefer The Rescue.	2001-09-29

It turned out to be a pleasant surprise and somewhat intrigued awe that Nicholas Sparks has woven suspence, tragedy and ironies in his latest romance novel. The first few chapters were brisk and heart-wrenching when an adorably described 4-year-old was found missing after an accident, leaving his mother distressed and in a daze. Descriptions of characters, especially Kyle (a verbally impaired child), displayed so much of Nicholas' linguistic dexterity and ultimate mastery in writing. The story is not at all draggy nor told tersely, but at a pace such that you enjoy every word like drink for the soul. Beautifully crafted, almost reminiscent of the movie Frequency, and filled with nuances of love and life -- A must-read for all avid readers and Nicholas Sparks fans. That's what you should do.	2001-08-18

I never knew that this book was so much fun which I thought looked a little daunting when I was little. Indeed, the English was stupendous and maybe a little deep for a 10 year old. 13-15 would be much more a right age. The story is very much a fairy tale, and yet at the same time blended with wit, adventure and mystery wrapped together in a very much believable context.

I was quite disturbed that 3 people died in the first 5 chapters, later 1 or 2  more died including the character's child. That was appalling, and I think  the author is trying to say, by using comparison between Julie and her  husband, to survive one must help oneself and through supplication to God.  But it was so obscure that it looks as if the whole story talks about how  fate plays with their lives. They lost money, houses, everything, and then  the story ended off with both of them walking back to I-forgot-where to  start afresh.

Really, this is the best book I've ever read after &quot;The Best Laid Plans&quot; again by Sidney Sheldon. If you are reading other reviews on this book, try to avoid ones telling you the synopsis, or else there will  be no point, really, to read this book. I'm not going to tell you what it  is about but I could possibly tell you that be prepared that the climax is  not reached until the third book. Be sure to read till the end, or you'll  regret! Now about Sheldon: He has the ability to frame an innocent person  to look like the tyrant of the century and conceal so meticulously the  deepest secret of an ordinary person. I guess that's what makes Sheldon's  books so special and luridly intriguing!	1999-01-24

It's really impossible to read Sidney's mind and he is an unprecedented Master of Suspence. Let him take you on a rollercoaster  ride!	1999-01-19

Tracing the witnesses, Commander Ballemy travelled all around the world, but never realised the whole plot and conspiracy behind this mission. In the end, the hunter was the most hunted person.

And the life of the most celebrated woman of the world is so clearly told by him. Really, Diana lived a hard life, apart from her bulimia and eating disorders, she  was so badly smeared by the Royals, especially the Queen Mother and so  despairingly hounded by the resilient and yet relentless paparazzi. Truely,  we must not canonize her memories as her brother had so profoundly  reminded. She will live forever, only now, she is in God's hands.	1998-12-28

As a student in Singapore, I haven't had much time for reading storybooks due to the long school hours and tight schedule for exams and tests. But I make it a point to read at least 50 pages a day to nourish my mind. But  when I picked up The Best Laid Plans, I had a feeling that it would be  good. (Partly because I like the cover also) This is also my first Sidney  Sheldon book, and I must say I was astounded by the shift flow of events  and double meanings used in this book. It also shows how people think in  their mind, which is absent in most books and we cannot truly develope a  clear understanding of the characters. Apart from the errotic moments in  this book that most people are interested in, the plot is superb and  unpredictable. It moves you in circles, but at the same time, well paced  and can be easily followed. The number of characters is also ample to draw  out the plot, but Sidney doesn't overdo it. For example, when a story  includes and draws in too many characters, it confuses people. I couldn't  stop, I broke my plan and finished it in 2 days. I am so happy to have  bought this book and wish that Sidney will continue to produce novels of  such high qualities. And that also mean that I will buy a bulk of his past  15 or so novels!	1998-11-05

The lucid news of the death of Chris McCandless prevails in the first chapter, and this captures your imagination. It works, pretty well. It's quite a short novel and you can read it at ease. Jon has vividly painted a picture of Chris! However, it sounds little like a memoir.	1998-07-24

The pictures are well scanned and there are footnotes to tell you about the history of Cunard Line. The book also mentions about the Queens of the Atlantic, the Mary, Elizabeth and QE2. The layout is nice and the organization of information is discreet and orderly. It's quite a good read!	1998-07-19

Gail being lost at sea, and some other peripherals of this Mother of the Storms. It brings you into the story and you get to experience the 100-foot waves and the 70 kt winds. The story is well paced and I think that works, it makes the story an exciting one. It shows you the theme of dangers at sea and a slight glimpse on the human reaction. Pretty good read, I must say.	1998-07-17

Everest. With so many lives loss, the story is made interesting and lucid. I'm not being callous about the losses of lives, but this is the way the story captures you. It's a terrific page turner and you just can't put the book down. From my own experience, I find that I read this book exceptionally fast. I like the ending, especially. Jon depicts the theme of unpredictability of the mountain, and weaves tales of Gods and Goddesses. But there is one flaw about this book, the story is not in chronological order sometimes, and Jon keeps changing the names from the first to last. However, it is still a must-read!	1998-07-10
US	52677928	RODVYGHJLFVJS	0385490992	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A compassionate author for the poor	This novel talks about a rich lawyer in a big firm, becoming a street lawyer for the homeless, having held a hostage by a homeless man. I would say that this title is not as good as the Rainmaker, though the research is just as good. This is one thing I like about Grisham. His novels are practical at least. Of the 290+ reviews, many criticize a hell out of this book, but I think that it is not so bad, that's why I gave it a 4 star.  However, I must say the settlement of the eviction case in the story is not very arousing and exciting, moreover, the ending is not very appropriate (rather abrupt). Personally, I feel that the end could be brushed on upon more.	1998-07-05

And the story's a bit different from history. Was there really a boat for the officers? Though this fully arrives at our title: Every Man For Himself. For me, I would rather catch the movie as the book is lacking in sound-effects after all.	1998-06-23
