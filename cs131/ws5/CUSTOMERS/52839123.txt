US	52839123	RBSDXVM3NBMIB	0743435931	537732403	Empire From the Ashes (Weber, David)	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Excellent Sci Fi adventure series, weak ending in book 3	This is a great series. The first two books in the series, \\"Mutineer's Moon\\" and \\"The Armageddon Inheritance\\" are pure Science Fiction.   I won't attempt to compete with the review the author's own brother posted below on March 26, 2003.   <br /> <br />The third book, \\"Heirs of Empire\\" has a different style.  It reminds me of Star Trek, where Capt. Kirk is flying through outer space in his futuristic space ship, when suddenly he beams down to a planet that's the Roman Empire, or the Wild West, or Nazi Germany.  And guess what?  His phaser doesn't work and the Enterprise had to leave orbit because of some nasty Klingons.  He has to rely on his wits to survive.  <br /> <br />This book is just like that and I love it. The teenage children of the hero from the first two books, get marooned on a more primitive planet.  It's sort of a cross between the American Civil War and the European Middle ages. They can't use their futuristic weapons, and have to rely on their wits to survive and go home. There's still the Science Fiction David Webber is known for, since the story keeps flashing back to Dad and an evil plot back on Earth to overthrow the Empire. But it's the story of the kids fighting their way across a world, that makes this story for me.  <br /> <br />I would have given this 5 stars except for the ending. I really don't know what the author was trying to do there, but I think he was trying to be creative. I've read quite a few of his many other books, so I know he knows how to end a book correctly. He just chose not to do it with this one.  I think he was just trying to be different for the fun of it. I didn't like it.  Don't do it again David. <br />	2005-01-04

I have never found another series that was it's equal. Even when the same authors got together again for books 6 and 7 (which I have reviewed separately) they couldn't recreate the magic of this series.  <br /> <br />THE GENERAL series (now released in a two volume omnibus edition - Warlord and Conqueror) is about a fallen interstellar society which has climbed it's way back up to the technological level of the American Civil War. The hero, Raj Whitehall, has to reunite the planet in order to reach the stars again some day. This involves a lot of fighting and empire building. What gives Raj his edge is the pre-fall computer he has linked with that can see through his eyes.  <br /> <br />This series has outstanding character development, a solid and well thought out overall plot line, and good story resolution in each book. The two things that really make the series the top of its genre are the interaction between the computer and the hero, and the realism of the situation. The interaction is a delicate balance that the authors perform magically. If the computer (Center) contributes too much, then the hero has too much of an edge, he doesn't have to try, and the story becomes boring. Without the computer, the hero is just this god like superhuman character that can do no wrong. The computer assistance makes Raj identifiable to the reader, even after he overcomes overwhelming odds to defeat the enemy. The realism comes from the fact that Raj is based on the life of a real person. The whole story is very similar to the story of Byzantine General Belisarius who conquered most of the Mediterranean world for his Emperor after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. That makes it very believable. The characters are very real. Their actions really happened a millenium and a half ago.  <br /> <br />This is a must read for any fan of military fiction or empire building. <br />	2005-01-04

IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.<br />I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.<br />I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.<br />1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to anotherplanet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.<br />2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.<br />3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.<br />4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.<br />5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.<br />6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.<br />7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.<br />8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.<br />9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.<br />10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.<br />11.) Slave Girl...- 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.<br />12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.<br />13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.<br />14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.<br />15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.<br />16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.<br />17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.<br />18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages.  Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.<br />19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.<br />20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival.  Cos goes to war with Ar.<br />21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.<br />22.) Dancer... - unread. Another Slave Girl novel? This is where I stopped even looking in the bookstore.<br />23.) Vagabonds... - unread.<br />24.) Magicians... - 1988, unread.<br />25.) Witness... - 2002, unread. I read on amazon that this is a story about Marlenus with amnesia, told by a slave girl.<br />26.) Prize... - unread. This is not yet published.	2003-11-24

US	52839123	R80VUWD3Z2X9E	0759201471	319882001	Outlaw of Gor	Books	4	38	41	N	N	Early books are the best in Gor Series	I read the Gor series as a boy in the 70's and early 80's. IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys. I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it. I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over. The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way. These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers. My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.<br />I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men. Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting. I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned. It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring. I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence. Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts. Maybe Eric Flint could do it? He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it. Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.<br />I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was. It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works. I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading. I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees. So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info. Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.<br />1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966. Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to anotherplanet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior. This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend. Note - the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange, the author's real name.<br />2.) Outlaw... - 1967. Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.<br />3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968. Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.<br />4.) Nomads... - 1969. Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.<br />5.) Assassin... - 1970. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar, greatest city-state on Gor. Note - this is the first copy I have by Del Rey books, and it has cover art by Boris. I may not like reading about the Gorean philosophy on sexual roles for men and women, but I can't get enough of Boris' artwork depicting it.<br />6.) Raiders... - 1971. Tarl Cabot goes to Port Kar, pirate capitol of scum and villainy, and learns the meaning of shame. More Boris art on the cover of the Del Rey edition.<br />7.) Captive... - 1972. A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor. The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end. At least Tarl Cabot has a few pages at the end, to tie this book into the rest of the series. This is also the last book published by Ballantine books, which I think is significant in the content and direction of the rest of the series.<br />8.) Hunters... - 1974. Tarl Cabot goes to the Northern Forest and meets amazon type women. This seems to be the first time there was a break in John Norman's writing, undoubtedly related to his switch to Daw books as a publisher.<br />9.) Marauders... - 1975. Tarl Cabot goes to the land of the Norsemen and meets Viking type Marauders.<br />10.) Tribesmen... - 1976. Tarl Cabot goes to the Tahari desert.<br />11.) Slave Girl...- 1977. Earth girl Judy Thornton enslaved on Gor. Again. No Tarl Cabot at all.<br />12.) Beasts... - 1978. Tarl Cabot goes to the Arctic ice pack and meets Eskimo type people.<br />13.) Explorers... - 1979. Tarl Cabot goes to the equatorial rain forests.<br />14.) Fighting Slave... - 1980. Earthman Jason Marshall is enslaved and forced to fight in a pit on Gor.<br />15.) Rogue... - 1981. Jason Marshall wanders free on Gor.<br />16.) Guardsman... - 1981. Jason Marshall earns a homeland.<br />17.) Savages... - 1982. Tarl Cabot goes to the great plains and meets American Indian type savages. Note - If you like this, John Norman also wrote \\"Ghost Dance\\" in 1970, a similar type story about real American Indians. I'm impressed that he kept the writing schedule he did on the Gor novels, and still wrote other books on the side. He also wrote \\"Time Slave\\" in 1975.<br />18.) Blood Brothers... - 1982. Savages and Blood Brothers are a two-part set. Just recently read this conclusion to Savages.  Brings closure to Ubar of the Skies.<br />19.) Kajira... - unread. Another Slave girl story.<br />20.) Players... - 1984. Tarl Cabot joins the Carnival.  Cos goes to war with Ar.<br />21.) Mercenaries... - 1985. Tarl Cabot returns to Ar again to try to save it.<br />22.) Dancer... - unread.

A new character, Elinor Brinton, is captured on Earth and becomes a slave girl on Gor.  The first time this is done, it may be slightly creative and a little interesting, but it is a radical departure from the earlier books and I consider it to be the beginning of the end.

IMHO the series is most appealing to teenage boys.  I recently pulled \\"Assassins of Gor\\" off the shelf one night while bored, and re-read it.  I was shocked that there was no real sex, and only a handful of pages of philosophy and psychology that I had to skip over.  The book was really excellent, although in a straight forward, uncomplicated sort of way.  These are escapist novels, richly detailed, which immerse you in an exotic world, not real thinkers.  My enduring memories were of the later books in the series, which were almost unreadable because whole chapters were devoted to philosophy and psychology.<br />I am not offended by the idea that it is natural and enjoyable for women to be submissive to men.  Although I recognize it as wish fulfillment fantasy, still I consider it harmless, especially in such an obviously fictitious setting.  I even found it mildly interesting the first time it was mentioned.  It is the umpteenth repetition that I find boring.  I just turn those pages, skipping ahead to the next action sequence.  Speaking of wish fulfillment, I wish someone would edit the series, and re-publish it without these parts.  Maybe Eric Flint could do it?  He likes to edit, according to his afterword to \\"1633\\" and he's good at it.  Of course, if you take the sex out of Gor you get Barsoom, and that story has already been written.<br />I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new going on with the series, and there was.  It is being reprinted, starting at the beginning, and at least 2 new books seem to be published, or at least in the works.  I was disappointed though that Amazon didn't have the whole series listed under one easy to find heading.  I guess there are, after all, millions of books and only so many Amazon employees.  So I'm listing the series, in order, along with some brief info.  Some of these books I haven't read, as noted.<br />1.) Tarnsman of Gor - 1966.  Earthman, Tarl Cabot, goes to another planet, hidden on the opposite side of our sun, and becomes a master swordsman and Warrior.  This is the book that is most like \\"Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, which I highly recommend.  Note - in my copy, a 1975 reprint, the 1966 copyright is held by John Lange.  Makes me wonder if Norman isn't a pen name.<br />2.) Outlaw... - 1967.  Tarl Cabot returns to Gor, to find he's been outlawed.<br />3.) Priest-Kings... - 1968.  Tarl Cabot goes to lair of Priest-Kings to clear his name.<br />4.) Nomads... - 1969.  Tarl Cabot goes to Southern Plains, and meets Mongol type nomads.<br />5.) Assassin... - 1970.

That doesn't just mean that he creates entire worlds that are unique, richly detailed, and believable.  It doesn't just mean that his characters are fully fleshed out individuals.  It means that when you read the ending you say \\"Wow! How did he come up with that.\\"  Well, it's because he's brilliant.  It also must be because he started with an idea of the ending and crafted the entire story to lead up to it.  Unfortunately it's difficult to review his stories without giving the ending away.  If you've read some of Duncan's other series, like \\"The Seventh Sword\\", \\"A Man of his Word\\", or \\"The Great Game\\", you'll know what to expect.<br />\\"The Sky of Swords\\" is the conclusion of a trilogy.  The first book is \\"The Gilded Chain\\" about a character named Durendal.  The second book is \\"Lord of the Fire Lands\\" about a character named Radgar, although many of the characters from the first book also appear in the second.  The problem is that something happens in the second book, which specifically doesn't happen in the first.  Resolving this contradiction is really the whole purpose of the third book.  Although it's possible to read this as a stand-alone novel, it's really a bad idea.<br />The thing about resolving the contradiction is that the characters haven't read the books, and don't know that there's a contradiction.  Events have to occur which force them to want to change things.  For this reason \\"Sky of Swords\\" is not as happy a book as the first two were.  It's rather dark and depressing, as the characters are being driven to desperation.  It wouldn't be much fun to read this story by itself.  The ending not only resolves the contradiction though; I found it very satisfying.	2003-01-22
US	52839123	R23AKMMRQQ5HTX	0743435575	730632235	Conrad's Time Machine	Books	3	10	12	N	N	Not really a Conrad book	This is a fun little book, but not great.  It is important to know that the book has nothing to do with Conrad himself.  (I suspect it must have been the publisher's idea to put \\"Conrad\\" in the title.)  It is the story of how his cousin invented (discovered really) the time machine that Conrad later stumbles into.  You can read the first 12 chapters on the web to see how you like it.  All you have to do is go to the Baen web site and click on \\"schedule\\", then find this (or another) book to read the beginning.  <br />This book really divides itself into three parts.  The beginning, which is almost entirely available on the web for free, is the story of Tom (Conrad's cousin) and his two buddies working to develop the time machine.  The book then quickly transitions into the middle where the buddies are (rather suddenly) Lords of their own country.  Here you get a fun glimpse of what it would be like to have anything and everything you ever wanted, or thought you wanted.  This is the sort of stuff a story about being the first on your block with your own time machine should be.  Finally there is a cataclysmic event and everything is wrapped up quickly, leaving plenty of room for a sequel. <br />I found the ending to be weak, short, and unsatisfying, and to detract from the book as a whole.  Conversely though, there isn't much of it, so it doesn't detract that much.  All in all, it's a fun couple of hours of reading.  Just don't expect it to measure up to the brilliant Conrad series and you won't be disappointed.	2003-01-22
US	52839123	RLFLQT1Z5CW6P	0345352912	271908123	The Reluctant Swordsman (Seventh Swordsman, Book 1)	Books	5	40	45	N	N	Best Trilogy by a Major Talent	\\"The Reluctant Swordsman\\" (Seventh Sword, Book 1)introduces the characters and world/universe the author continues with in \\"The Coming of Wisdom\\" (Seventh Sword, Book 2)and \\"The Destiny of the Sword\\" (Seventh Sword, Book 3). This is a brilliant trilogy which remains at the top of Dave Duncan's impressive body of work. This third book doesn't just follow the first two. It reveals things which the author put there all along, giving the reader a new appreciation of the characters and events. That sounds confusing, but read it and see.<br />The characters remind me of Dungeons and Dragons Roll Playing Games (D&D RPG's). The hero is a 7th level swordsman who picks up a 7th level priest as a travelling companion. There is the same satisfaction of watching a companion swordsman advance through the ranks as there is developing your own character's skill levels in an RPG. There are also some other character types familiar to RPG's (archer's are held in contempt). This is not one of those cheap knockoffs on a D&D game though. This is just one element of the world the author has created which is kind of fun.<br />The author created a universe with a multitude of gods, like the Greek and Roman gods. While this is very common in the sword and sorcery genre, Dave Duncan has made the gods active participants in his story. One god makes repeated appearances, talks with the hero, and performs the occasional miracle. The author is able to keep the gods from completely overshadowing the human characters by stressing how they value \\"free will\\" for their own purposes. The author's brilliant use of deity characters (a recurring element throughout his best series) adds facets to this story which lift it above a simple Conan type \\"guy with sword\\" story. <br />This trilogy has a detailed, multi-leveled plot which twists enough to keep you in suspense right up until the ending. And the ending reaches the appropriate dramatic climax, then has a satisfying denouement where the characters reaptheir rewards and the author ties up any loose ends. When this book ended, I was left saying, \\"Wow, imagine that!\\"<br />The only thing I can even think of that I didn't like about this trilogy is that it ended. The author really wrapped things up for the characters. It would be almost impossible to continue the story. I do hope that Dave Duncan comes back to this world with some new characters though. Maybe the old characters can have a cameo in the new story . . .	2000-09-27

Before these books, L. Sprague De Camp had held that title for decades with his &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, but it was too short. Mark Twain may be the most famous with his &quot;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, but that is more light hearted than serious, and disappointing at the end. The Conrad series delivers on all the promise, and even after 5 books, it still leaves you wanting more. (There is a sixth book now, but Conrad is a minor character, and I've reviewed it separately.)<br />I say realistic timeline, because Conrad isn't really from our timeline. I was a little suspicious right from the start, but it wasn't until Conrad reminisced about the Mongols invading France that I thought &quot;Hey, wait a minute&quot;. It turns out that it didn't happen to us (even without Conrad). But the historians I read agree that it would have, except the great Khan died and the Mongols had a war of succession which they never recovered from. This is often used as an example of the actions of one person changing history. I never even heard the story, until Conrad got me to look it up. Go figure.<br />This is an action story, with fighting and sex, where Conrad overcomes insurmountable obstacles, and usually has a good time along the way. The author doesn't just ignore the time travel though. He writes a science fiction sub-plot about that too. In fact, the author is obviously an engineer, not just because it takes an engineer for Conrad to build the things he does, but also from the way the books were planned out and crafted. Obviously the author planned the Mongol invasion and built the series around it, but he also foreshadows romantic sub-plots 3 books in advance. <br />I love these books, and share other reviewers disbelief that they haven't been reprinted since 1993. If you've already read them, and love them too, you might want to try &quot;The Misplaced Legion (Videssos Cycle, Book 1)&quot; by Harry Turtledove, about elements of one of Caesar's legions travelling into Rome's future of the Byzantine Empire. Only it's not the real Byzantine Empire, it's a parallel universe where magic works. Aside from that, it's Byzantium during the 1100's written by a Byzantine historian. And of course you'll want to read the &quot;Island in the Sea of Time&quot; series by S. M. Stirling, about modern day Nantucket going back in time to the Trojan War. These works are different, but also 5 stars.	2000-09-27

I have never found another that was it's equal.  Even when the same author's got together again for books 6 and 7 (which I have reviewed separately) they couldn't recreate the magic of this series.<br />THE GENERAL series is about a fallen interstellar society which has climbed it's way back up to the technological level of the American Civil War.  The hero, Raj Whitehall, has to reunite the planet in order to reach the stars again some day.  This involves a lot of fighting and empire building.  What gives Raj his edge is the pre-fall computer he has linked with that can see through his eyes.  <br />This series has outstanding character development, a solid and well thought out overall plot line, and good story resolution in each book.  The two things that really make the series the top of its genre are the interaction between the computer and the hero, and the realism of the situation.  The interaction is a delicate balance that the authors perform magically.  If the computer (Center) contributes too much, then the hero has too much of an edge, he doesn't have to try, and the story becomes boring. Without the computer, the hero is just this god like superhuman character that can do no wrong.  The computer assistance makes Raj identifiable to the reader, even after he overcomes overwhelming odds to defeat the enemy.  The realism comes from the fact that Raj is based on the life of a real person.  The whole story is very similar to the story of Byzantine General Belisarius who conquered most of the Mediterranean world for His Emperor after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.  That makes it very believable.  The characters are very real.  Their actions really happened a millenium and a half ago.<br />This is a must read for any fan of military fiction or empire building.	2000-09-27

They're basically saying this is an alternate history story about a world that isn't exactly like ours! Stretch your minds a bit guys, that's kind of the whole point. <br />That being said, I do agree that there are some unanswered questions about the Draka's early history. I understand that the author is planning to write a new book about the Draka in WWI. I hope he is planning to continue the series with a prequel about the Draka involvement in the American Civil War, when they sent aid to the Confederate States. I would also like to read about their involvement in the Napoleonic Wars when they took Egypt away from the French and really got started on their road to power.<br />This is a well written and thoughtful story with excellent character development. (For some reason S.M. Stirling likes to write about female protagonists, usually lesbians. I imagine this is just to be creative and eye opening because it's not the norm and he is demonstrating that it could be.) The reason that I bumped it down to only four stars is because it was a little slow and dry in places. That may be the editing. I have only read the hardcover trilogy version and I understand a lot was left out from the original, which may have tied everything together better...	2000-09-25

Not only the entire town, but also the coal mines under the town are transported. This creates an instant source of power for the modern industrial base their local machine shops introduce to medieval Europe. The plot, such as it is, is that the Americans are going to introduce the concept of democracy to war ravaged Germany. There are a number of fun scenes where the hillbillies use modern weapons, vehicles, or tactics ... against the primitives.<br />The story is not as much fun as it could be though. The first and most glaring problem is that the writing style is only one or two steps up from a \\"Dick and Jane\\" story. (See Spot run. See Jane run.) One of the other reviewers called it comic book writing, with which I would have to agree. The words are short and simple. The sentences are short and simple. The characters are, mostly, two dimensional stereotypes. Sometimes the author tries to be creative and blends two stereotypes together into a single character. My favorite of these is the cold blooded sniper who feels no remorse when killing the enemy from ambush, who is also the captain of her High School cheerleading squad because she's just SO full of spirit. After a while, you just get used to his style though, and maybe it's great for kids.<br />Another thing that really bothered me personally, is that they are in the middle of an historical event, the 30 years war. They have a school library. They know what happens. They should pick a side (the author is very partial to the Protestants and Gustavus Adolphus, which is fine), take advantage of their knowledge of the future and their superior weaponry to win a decisive victory, then march on the enemy capitol and end the war. In other words, fight to win. The Battle of Breitenfield would have been a great place to turn a Protestant victory into a complete Catholic rout. The Americans should have known all about Breitenfield in advance, the same as the author did, yet they didn't even show up at the battle. Instead they think it makes sense to try and mind their own business, despite a Monroe Doctrine type policy of protecting themselves and their neighbors from invasion. This is just an invitation for the enemy to scout out their capabilities and defenses, and take their time to mount a well planned out attack against them.<br />Finally, modern weapons are great and all, but if the good guys lost a round or two occasionally, it would be much more dramatic when they finally won in the end.	2000-09-19

Before these books, L. Sprague De Camp had held that title for decades with  his &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, but it was too short. Mark Twain may be  the most famous with his &quot;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's  Court&quot;, but that is more light hearted than serious, and disappointing  at the end. The Conrad series delivers on all the promise, and even after 5  books, it still leaves you wanting more. (There is a sixth book now, but  Conrad is a minor character, and I've reviewed it separately.)<br />I say  realistic timeline, because Conrad isn't really from our timeline. I was a  little suspicious right from the start, but it wasn't until Conrad  reminisced about the Mongols invading France that I thought &quot;Hey, wait  a minute&quot;. It turns out that it didn't happen to us (even without  Conrad). But the historians I read agree that it would have, except the  great Khan died and the Mongols had a war of succession which they never  recovered from. This is often used as an example of the actions of one  person changing history. I never even heard the story, until Conrad got me  to look it up. Go figure.<br />This is an action story, with fighting and sex,  where Conrad overcomes insurmountable obstacles, and usually has a good  time along the way. The author doesn't just ignore the time travel though.  He writes a science fiction sub-plot about that too. In fact, the author is  obviously an engineer, not just because it takes an engineer for Conrad to  build the things he does, but also from the way the books were planned out  and crafted. Obviously the author planned the Mongol invasion and built the  series around it, but he also foreshadows romantic sub-plots 3 books in  advance. <br />I love these books, and share other reviewers disbelief that  they haven't been reprinted since 1993. If you've already read them, and  love them too, you might want to try &quot;The Misplaced Legion (Videssos  Cycle, Book 1)&quot; by Harry Turtledove, about elements of one of Caesar's  legions travelling into Rome's future of the Byzantine Empire. Only it's  not the real Byzantine Empire, it's a parallel universe where magic works.  Aside from that, it's Byzantium during the 1100's written by a Byzantine  historian. And of course you'll want to read the &quot;Island in the Sea of  Time&quot; series by S. M. Stirling, about modern day Nantucket going back  in time to the Trojan War. These works are different, but also 5 stars.	2000-08-29

Sprague De Camp. To my mind this first  series by the master of alternate history is a time travel book based  loosely upon that previous classic. Elements of one of Caesar's legions are  transported forward in time to the Byzantine Empire. Only it's not the  Byzantine Empire, it's the Videssos Empire in another universe where magic  works. Aside from that, it's the Byzantine Empire written by a Byzantine  historian. Aside from just surviving, the hero must prevent his new  homeland from being overrun by barbarians &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;.  For this reason I consider this the best time travel series to a fictitious  universe ever written, as well as the best series about a Roman Legion. It  is a must read for anyone interested in the Roman Empire, the Byzantine  Empire, or time travel.<br />One of the many things which make this series  interesting is that the heroes are from Caesar's Rome. Rome is young  energetic vibrant and, most of all, expanding at this time. They are  transported to the Byzantine/Videssos Empire while it is in a period of  decline. (If it were the real Byzantine Empire, it would be the final  decline, but we can still hope for a revival of the Videssos Empire.) The  decadence brought by a thousand years of Empire is sharply contrasted with  the vibrant patriotism of our heroes who remain unknowing that this is the  destiny of their empire too.<br />This isn't just a military book where the  legion moves from battle to battle. This is a much more realistic and  complete world where the hero is thrust into the middle of court politics,  and has to fight to overcome the shear inertia of the Empire's slide  towards collapse. The hero spends more time facing corruption, political  intrigue, distrustful monarchs, intolerant monks, and tax collectors than  he does facing mounted cavalry units.<br />I don't want to repeat the  excellentreview about the warfare in this series written by Robert, 12 MAR  99, under &quot;The Misplaced Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 1). I  would like to add though, that this is not a series about a general. This  is not a David Drake/S.M. Sterling series about Belisarius. As Robert  points out, the hero of this series stands in the middle of the battles,  and seldom knows more of what's going on than immediately to his left and  right. The battles themselves are mostly standup fights where two sides  hack at each other. This is really much more realistic though. Most  battles, especially in the Roman era, were fought this way. Even though  nowadays it seems like every book we read is about Belisarius, brilliant  generals with innovative battlefield ideas come along only once in a  thousand years or so. Most battles are fought without them.<br />&quot;The  Misplaced Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 1) is followed by &quot;An  Emperor for the Legion&quot; (The Videssos Cycle Book, 2), &quot;The Legion  of Videssos&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 3), and &quot;Swords of the  Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 4). There are two prequel series about  Videssos. The first is the Tale of Krispos series, beginning with  &quot;Krispos Rising.&quot; This is actually a two book story, which is  excellent, and a third follow on novel which is very good. The other  prequel, The Time of Troubles series, begins with &quot;The Stolen  Throne&quot;. This series is entertaining, but not really as good as the  first two series.<br />Although there are ten other books about Videssos,  there can never be enough. And there are only four books about the  Misplaced Legion. There needs to be a sequel series not another prequel.  Perhaps &quot;Legion of Videssos: Next Generation&quot; where Marcus's son,  born and raised in Videssos, can become Emperor, with Dad and his Legion  helping out of course. This could lead to a new golden age for Videssos,  and maybe even . . .	2000-08-29

As others have pointed out, this is only half a story.  Actually it may be even less, depending on how many books there turn out to be in this series.  My guess would be that this is a third of a story.  This wasn't a problem in the GENERAL series.  This hasn't bothered either of the two authors in other series they've written.  There is some logic for ending this book where they did (I'm sure it looked great in outline).  The authors never really developed a big culmination though.  This book just kind of stops after one fight scene.  It isn't even a battle as far as I am concerned.  <br />This problem was compounded by Baen putting all but the last 4 chapters on their web site for free.  After reading all that for free, I expected the pay story to go on for a while.  It doesn't.  I haven't counted pages, but I would estimate that there's only another 10% as far as length is concerned...  If I thought the authors intended to leave things like this, I would only give this book one or two stars.  The story is a follow-on to the GENERAL series, the same as &quot;The Chosen&quot; was.  It is set in the later Roman Empire -- not a similar period, the actual Roman Empire. This Roman Empire just happens to have a different name, and be on a different planet, sometime in the future.  (This is a little hoke, as some other reviewers have mentioned.)  The characters are better developed than they were in &quot;The Chosen&quot;, although not as well as they were in the GENERAL series.  <br />My recommendation would be to read the Baen web page and pass on the book until there is a sequel, or better yet a boxed set.	2000-08-18

Raj only has a bit part in this story, although  his reminiscing about his life after the general series ended was  satisfying (but short).  <br />This is a World War I technology level war  story, with very interesting battle scenes, but poor character involvement.   The story skips in and out of the hero's life over a period of decades.   As a reader, I never really connected that much with the people.  I was  interested in the final outcome of the war, but the nations were just as  interesting as the people in this story, and just as identifiable.<br />This  is a good solid read.  If you are a big Raj Whitehall fan, it's fun to  think that Center has given him a sort of immortality.  If you want to see  two of the greatest military authors have fun with World War I, this book  is definitely for you.  Maybe, as some reviewers have mentioned, if this  were expanded into a whole series I would have felt more involved with the  characters.	2000-08-18

Before these books, L. Sprague De Camp had held that title for decades with  his &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, but it was too short.  Mark Twain may  be the most famous with his &quot;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's  Court&quot;, but that is more light hearted than serious, and disappointing  at the end.  The Conrad series delivers on all the promise, and even after  5 books, it still leaves you wanting more.  (There is a sixth book now, but  Conrad is a minor character, and I've reviewed it separately.)<br />I say  realistic timeline, because Conrad isn't really from our timeline.  I was a  little suspicious right from the start, but it wasn't until Conrad  reminisced about the Mongols invading France that I thought &quot;Hey, wait  a minute&quot;.  It turns out that it didn't happen to us (even without  Conrad).  But the historians I read agree that it would have, except the  great Khan died and the Mongols had a war of succession which they never  recovered from.  This is often used as an example of the actions of one  person changing history.  I never even heard the story, until Conrad got me  to look it up.  Go figure.<br />This is an action story, with fighting and  sex, where Conrad overcomes insurmountable obstacles, and usually has a  good time along the way.  The author doesn't just ignore the time travel  though.  He writes a science fiction sub-plot about that too.  In fact, the  author is obviously an engineer, not just because it takes an engineer for  Conrad to build the things he does, but also from the way the books were  planned out and crafted.  Obviously the author planned the Mongol invasion  and built the series around it, but he also foreshadows romantic sub-plots  3 books in advance.  <br />I love these books, and share other reviewers  disbelief that they haven't been reprinted since 1993.  If you've already  read them, and love them too, you might want to try &quot;The Misplaced  Legion (Videssos Cycle, Book 1)&quot; by Harry Turtledove, about elements  of one of Caesar's legions travelling into Rome's future of the Byzantine  Empire.  Only it's not the real Byzantine Empire, it's a parallel universe  where magic works.  Aside from that, it's Byzantium during the 1100's  written by a Byzantine historian.  And of course you'll want to read the  &quot;Island in the Sea of Time&quot; series by S. M. Stirling, about  modern day Nantucket going back in time to the Trojan War.

Sprague De Camp.  To my mind this  first series by the master of alternate history is a time travel book based  loosely upon that previous classic.  Elements of one of Caesar's legions  are transported forward in time to the Byzantine Empire.  Only it's not the  Byzantine Empire, it's the Videssos Empire in another universe where magic  works.  Aside from that, it's the Byzantine Empire written by a Byzantine  historian.  Aside from just surviving, the hero must prevent his new  homeland from being overrun by barbarians &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;.   For this reason I consider this the best time travel series to a fictitious  universe ever written, as well as the best series about a Roman Legion.  It  is a must read for anyone interested in the Roman Empire, the Byzantine  Empire, or time travel.<br />One of the many things which make this series  interesting is that the heroes are from Caesar's Rome.  Rome is young  energetic vibrant and, most of all, expanding at this time.  They are  transported to the Byzantine/Videssos Empire while it is in a period of  decline. (If it were the real Byzantine Empire, it would be the final  decline, but we can still hope for a revival of the Videssos Empire.)  The  decadence brought by a thousand years of Empire is sharply contrasted with  the vibrant patriotism of our heroes who remain unknowing that this is the  destiny of their empire too.<br />This isn't just a military book where the  legion moves from battle to battle.  This is a much more realistic and  complete world where the hero is thrust into the middle of court politics,  and has to fight to overcome the shear inertia of the Empire's slide  towards collapse.  The hero spends more time facing corruption, political  intrigue, distrustful monarchs, intolerant monks, and tax collectors than  he does facing mounted cavalry units.<br />I don't want to repeat the  excellent review about the warfare in this series written by Robert, 12 MAR  99, under &quot;The Misplaced Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 1).  I  would like to add though, that this is not a series about a general.  This  is not a David Drake/S.M. Sterling series about Belisarius.  As Robert  points out, the hero of this series stands in the middle of the battles,  and seldom knows more of what's going on than immediately to his left and  right.  The battles themselves are mostly standup fights where two sides  hack at each other.  This is really much more realistic though.  Most  battles, especially in the Roman era, were fought this way.  Even though  nowadays it seems like every book we read is about Belisarius, brilliant  generals with innovative battlefield ideas come along only once in a  thousand years or so.  Most battles are fought without them.<br />&quot;The  Misplaced Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 1) is followed by &quot;An  Emperor for the Legion&quot; (The Videssos Cycle Book, 2), &quot;The Legion  of Videssos&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 3), and  &quot;Swords of the  Legion&quot; (Videssos Cycle, Book 4).  There are two prequel series about  Videssos.  The first is the Tale of Krispos series, beginning with  &quot;Krispos Rising.&quot;  This is actually a two book story, which is  excellent, and a third follow on novel which is very good.  The other  prequel, The Time of Troubles series, begins with &quot;The Stolen  Throne&quot;.  This series is entertaining, but not really as good as the  first two series.<br />Although there are ten books about Videssos, there can  never be enough.  And there are only four books about the Misplaced Legion.   There needs to be a sequel series not another prequel.  Perhaps  &quot;Legion of Videssos: Next Generation&quot; where Marcus's son, born  and raised in Videssos, can become Emperor, with Dad and his Legion helping  out of course.

They all ring  true, because they are based (sometimes loosely) upon real historical fact.   The realism of Videssos is unsurpassed.<br />In the third Krispos book, the  author moves on to explore two new themes: the differences between children  and their parents, which is especially important in dynastic empires; and  the difficulties of heresy in a single theology state.  Krispos raised his  children on his stories of growing up as a lowly peasant, but they remain  the pampered sons of the richest most powerful man in the world.  What is a  father to do?  At the same time that his family is giving him trouble, his  people (one people, one faith, one nation) develop a particularly nasty  heresy.  It is his duty to exterminate it, root and branch.  <br />This is  possibly the most realistic novel Harry Turtledove has written yet, since  every King and Emperor has had to face these worries about their children,  and this particular heresy broke out more than once in both Greek Orthodox  and Catholic Europe.  I would say this is a must read for anyone with  teenage children (or maybe for teenage children who have parents), and a  must read for anyone with an intense interest in theology and how it  affected the Greek Orthodox or Roman Catholic churches.  Since I don't fit  into any of these categories, I bumped it down to four  stars.  I really  feel that this is not so much due to any inadequacies on the author's part,  so much as inadequacies on my part as a reader.	2000-08-15

This is a brilliant trilogy which  remains at the top of Dave Duncan's impressive body of work.  This first  book introduces the main character to the world/universe and the other  characters.  Then he is presented with a problem, beyond just adjusting to  everything, which he overcomes by the end of the book.  So this is a full  stand-alone story which can be read by itself.  The next two books don't  just follow this first one.  They reveal things which the author put there  all along, giving the reader a new appreciation of the characters and  events.  That sounds confusing, but read it and see.<br />The characters  remind me of Dungeons and Dragons Roll Playing Games (D&amp;D RPG's).  The  hero is a 7th level swordsman who picks up a 7th level priest as a  travelling companion.  There is the same satisfaction of watching a  companion swordsman advance through the ranks as there is developing your  own character's skill levels in an RPG.  There are also some other  character types familiar to RPG's (archer's are held in contempt).  This is  not one of those cheap knockoffs on a D&amp;D game though.  This is just  one element of the world the author has created which is kind of fun.<br />The  author created a universe with a multitude of gods, like the Greek and  Roman gods.  While this is very common in the sword and sorcery genre, Dave  Duncan has made the gods active participants in his story.  One god makes  repeated appearances, talks with the hero, and performs the occasional  miracle.  The author is able to keep the gods from completely overshadowing  the human characters by stressing how they value &quot;free will&quot; for  there own purposes.  The author's brilliant use of deity characters (a  recurring element throughout his best series) add facets to this story  which lift it above a simple Conan type &quot;guy with sword&quot; story.   <br />This trilogy has a detailed, multi-leveled plot which twists enough to  keep you in suspense right up until the ending.  And the ending reaches the  appropriate dramatic climax, then has a satisfying denouement where the  characters reap their rewards and the author ties up any loose ends.  When  this book ended, I was left saying, &quot;Wow, imagine that!&quot;<br />The  only thing I can even think of that I didn't like about this trilogy is  that it ended.  The author really wrapped things up for the characters.  It  would be almost impossible to continue the story.  I do hope that Dave  Duncan comes back to this world with some new characters though.  Maybe the  old characters can have a cameo in the new story. . .	2000-08-14

It turned out though that I had misinterpreted what people were saying  about a more peaceful society run by women.  I had assumed that the time  travelers were going to go back in time to begin such a society.  It turns  out that they were going back in time to save this natural order of things  from the evil male dominated society of the horse people.  By saving the  peaceful society from the one invasion which brought evil into the world,  there would never be any warfare, and all the problems of the present day,  6,000 years later, would be instantly erased.<br />Although there are many  things that bother me about this, the most obvious is that Europe was  invaded by Nomadic Barbarians from the Steppe many many times.  It makes me  wonder if the author has ever heard of the Mongols, the Huns, or the Doric  invasion.  Even if you assume that the first invasion of peaceful farmers  by ravaging nomadic horsemen occurred around 4,000 BC, stopping that one  invasion wouldn't stop the future invasions.<br />The next problem is the  author's premise that evil barbarity must come off the steppe, simply  because our best guess at archeology and anthropology is that it happened  that way in our past.  In my opinion, even if you brought a nuclear arsenal  back in time and created a radioactive dead zone from the Black Sea to the  Baltic, so that Europe could never be invaded from the steppe, the peaceful  farmers would eventually develop more complex societies that would come  into conflict with each other and develop warfare on their own.  <br />What  made Old Europeans peaceful in 4,000 BC was the low population density  relative to the abundance of natural resources.  If you increase the  population density so that one group of people is crowded against another,  the feeling of cooperation with your neighbor is likely to shift to  competitive resentment.  This leads in a natural progression to an us vs.  them mentality, and open fighting.  I don't believe that Europe's long  history of killing neighbors to take their land derives from the Nomadic  invasions of horse people.  <br />Although I think these starting premises  preclude any possibility of a thoughtful and provoking story, the author  didn't even make a good attempt.  In the very first chapter, the woman, who  is supposed to be in command but never really overcomes her own doubts and  indecision, runs away in the face of the enemy, leaving her partner for  dead.  Now I was in the Navy not the Marines or Army, but I would think  someone on patrol, particularly a West Point Cadet, would come and check  the pulse before running away and leaving their squadmate.  Maybe this is  more realistic under the circumstances, but it certainly isn't heroic,  something I look for in characters I read about. When the battle is over,  and they're both alive, they don't feel any remorse for the string of  mistakes which got the best 20% of their fighting force killed (the Great  Dane).  They make no effort at a Lessons Learned so they can do better next  time.  Instead they feel guilt and trauma about killing the bad guys in  self-defense.  It somehow makes them feel better to destroy the valuable  hand made stone knives they took from the enemy dead, rather than keeping  them for use by the peaceful farmers they are trying to save.  It goes down  hill from there.<br />Basically, this is a story about people I don't respect,  on a pointless mission, in a poorly thought out and implausible world.  I  would give it zero or negative stars if I could.	2000-08-07

It was another fun read from Leo Frankowski, but  different from his other books I have read.  I was expecting that he had  gotten tired of his Conrad books, as authors do, or felt that he had  brought that story line to a natural conclusion, but was looking to do the  same thing all over again with new characters in a new universe.  It turns  out I was wrong.  <br />He spends a few chapters in the beginning introducing  and developing his characters to a much greater extent than he has before.   I really feel like I know the two engineers.  Then he puts them in an  unusual situation by shipwrecking them on the floating island.  So far all  in line with what the jacket cover and reviews lead me to expect.  His  greater depth of character development, I chalk up to a more mature author.   He did a similar job in the opening chapters of &quot;a Boy and His  Tank&quot;.<br />Then he spends the whole middle of the book describing the  Island, both the physical and social history.  This is where I was  surprised.  Conrad, in the series which will always define Leo Frankowski  for me, spent his time building things, and fighting.  The new characters  start off very action oriented, then turn into vehicles who ask questions  so that the author can describe the Island.  Then they talk to themselves  about society in the real world and how it compares to the Island (the only  part I didn't care for).  They set out to build things, but don't have  Conrad's luck, at least not at first.  They try to avoid conflict, and in  this they have more luck than Conrad, although they aren't completely  successful of course.  The Island is the main character in the middle of  the book, not the people.  But the Island is fascinating, and this is not a  bad thing.<br />Then the end, just kind of ends.  The author did a good job of  keeping me guessing.  Right up until the last few pages, I wasn't sure  which way he was going to go with it.  But when he finished, it wasa bit  abrupt, and I said &quot;oh&quot; instead of &quot;Ah!&quot;.  I really got  the feeling that the author reached the length the Publisher required, so  he stopped writing.<br />This book is a &quot;what if&quot; book not an action  adventure book.  What if this Island existed?  Wouldn't that be cool.  What  if you were the ones who found it?  Wouldn't THAT be cool!  Guess what, it  would be cool.  Now that I'm done reading, I still think about it, the true  measure of a good book.  But I'm thinking about the Island, not the people.	2000-08-07

These works are  different, but also 5 star time travel books.	2000-08-07

I see a fundamental problem for the author in continuing this series however.  Life has become too easy for Conrad.  By  this point in the series he has done it all, he's way ahead of the  competition, and it's hard for the author to come up with any more  challenges for him.  I believe that is why Conrad was relegated to the  status of a minor character in this book, i.e. so that the story could  focus on the challenges of a &quot;mere mortal&quot; character.   Understanding this, didn't make it any more enjoyable though.  Conrad is  the character I came back to see more of.  It was disappointing to only see  him in passing.  <br />What was more disappointing though was that the author  did create a challenge for Conrad, and he couldn't handle it.  In the end  he got outside help, which was almost like cheating.  I want to see the  protagonist rise to the occasion and overcome his own obstacles, not have  them solved for him.<br />I was not offended by the gratuitous sex throughout  the book myself, but I can see how some of the other reviewers were.  As  sex goes, this was really very mild.  It is only because this is supposed  to be a science fiction/fantasy book and not an erotic novel that it is  even noticable.  That said, I would like to point out that it is rather  repetitious that the girls are always 14 years old, even the ones who have  been around for years now.  I understand that life expectancy was shorter  in the middle ages, and people were old in their 20's and dead in their  30's, but the author could mix it up a bit with some 15 or 16 year old  girls, just for variety.	2000-07-31
