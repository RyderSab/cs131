In it, the reader will find an intriguing tale that is intricately woven. James Ellroy creates vivid characters and writes in such a style that the reader is swept away and feels just like a police officer. This novel is great and should be read. Purchase it...today!<br />After seeing the masterful film, I was determined to find the novel it was based on. Upon finding it, I settled in expecting a book similar to the film. My assumption that the book was like the film was totally inaccurate. In many ways, I wish I hadn't seen the film beforehand. For it let me down on certain points of the book. Aside from these disappointments, it is a fine novel that you should read.<br />This novel has many things going for it. It is well-written, the characters have depth, and Ellroy's writing is superb. No doubt countless readers of this review have seen the film already. However, for those who haven't, I recommend you read the book first, then see the film. For those like myself, read the book. Just don't expect anything like the film. All in all, this excellent crime novel deserves a read for many reasons. Buy it today!	2002-07-19

This novel is good, but is slow moving and tedious at points. If the reader can get past that, they ensure themselves a good read. If you are Bond fan, you enjoy rich detail, or if you enjoy a good read THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO is a must have.<br />James Bond has been given an assignment to babysit the prime minister at a G8 conference in Japan. Meanwhile, he is to investigate the death of an English businessman. This investigation will take Bond on a slow journey all over Japan, and ultimately a good one. Bond fans know that 007 has deep emotional roots in Japan, and can appreciate Benson's choice of Japan as a locale for the novel. The addition of Bond's old friend Tiger Tanaka is also quite welcomed.<br />Benson's writing has a few flaws this go around. It is slow moving and tedious at times. This is a direct contradiction from Benson's usual style. Also, it is obvious that Benson tries to write as an English author would. Sometimes, he fails in that quest with words like \\"stuff\\" and \\"whatever\\". However, it must be said that you are immersed in Japanese culture as you read and the vilain's motivations are chillingly genuine. That being said, if you enjoy good reads, buy Benson's THE MAN WITH THE RED TATTOO today.	2002-06-26

From the beginning, I was taken with the writing style that Gerald Amster used to tell his story. It allowed the reader to become engrossed in the novel. If you enjoy great reading, humour, and adventure, you will love this novel.<br />This novel tells the true story of Gerald Amster. Amster was an American who was caught smuggling drugs in the USSR. This would be wrong and stupid today, but even more so in Amster's day. He then proceeds to tell of his \\"trial\\", and life in a Russian prison. This tale is told using great writing, with few flaws. It is a rare and wonderful book.<br />If you manage to find this book, pick it up. You will enjoy it, and will want others to read it. Amster's tale is well told, funny, touching, and thought-provoking all at once. It is a highly recommended and rare find that comes with my highest praises.	2002-06-16

It is a chillingly true look at the darkest of human nature. To the casual reader, it may seem just to be an adventure of lost boys. However, it has a darker and more sinister commentary on the nature of man. If you enjoy grand and classic literature, buy Sir William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES today.<br />The novel centres around four boys among several stranded on a presumably Pacific island. Each one is symbolic of a different aspect of human nature. In the beginning, each is still bound by societal limits. As time progresses, things turn for the worst as these limits melt away. Golding masterfully shows this waring away of society, one of the novel's finer points. One of the novel's flaws is that is tedious at many points. Otherwise, it is a grand novel.<br />If you enjoy classic literature, you should read this novel. If you enjoy thought-provoking work, read this novel. If you enjoy a highly pessimistic commentary on man's nature, read the book. If you don't enjoy tedious reading, or don't like reading a dark book about the evils of man, this novel is not for you...	2002-06-11

He has taken the literary James Bond into the film business. This was a bold move for Benson, seeing as some of the hardcore Bond fans might not like the idea. However, this bold move deserves the highest praise. It not only provides for a new realm that Bond has never been to. It also makes NEVER DREAM OF DYING a great read.<br />   After a botched raid on a French film studio, James Bond is under pressure and having to deal with lots of red tape. However, an unusual breakthrough in the Union case puts Bond back to work. The mission will send him to France and Monaco where he will meet up with an assorted cast of characters. Some these characters are the lovely Tylnn Mingnonne, his long-time colleague Rene Mathis, and even his father-in-law Marc-Ange Draco. To add Draco in the storyline to close up gaps that Fleming left was another brave move on Benson's part. Yet, it worked out and was a pleasant and unpleasant part of the story. There are many elements to NEVER DREAM OF DYING which make it great. Buy the book to find out.<br />   Raymond Benson took a chance with this fine book. It was well worth it though in my opinion. Benson has remained true to the original Bond of days of old. Most people seem to dislike this. This is merely because they are so used to the action-filled films, that they cannot appreciate Bond for the way he was created. To see Benson keep true with the Bond of Fleming's day earns him praise not only for this great book, but for being a great, bold and innovative author. NEVER DREAM OF DYING is a great book for many reasons. Bond's first outting into the film world makes NEVER DREAM OF DYING a book that you should buy.	2001-08-21

THE LAST PRECINCT was no exception. However, I found the book hard to get into and drawn out. The plot takes forever to unfold, and lots of the information is unecessary. The book was ok, and if you like Cornwell's works or are a die hard fan read THE LAST PRECINCT.<br />    Following the events of Cornwell's BLACK NOTICE, we find Dr. Kay Scarpetta in rare form. She has just had an encounter with &quot;The Werewolf&quot; also known as the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. This leaves her shocked, vulnerable, scared, and a suspect for murder. She will be required to look deep within herself to find the answers to several questions and to clear her good name. During this journey, she will find answers to things she did not want to know. We gather that she will never be the same again after all the things that happens to her. <br />   THE LAST PRECINCT was an ok book. Cornwell mainly wrote it to tie up loose ends from all her other books. This can be quite helpful if you are interested. Ultimately, Cornwell could have done better.

Though Cornwell has always been good at displaying Dr. Scarpetta's inner emotions, this time around, her emotions make for a dark book. Despite the unusually dark nature of this book, it is still worth a read.<br />  As a native son of Virginia, I always look forward to reading a Cornwell novel. This time around, a body has been found in a boat at the Harbour of Richmond. This badly decomposed body leads to the hunt for a French killer calling himself The Werewolf. This hunt is international, but even so, no one is safe.

It  appeals to me because it is set in Virginia, where I'm from. Cornwell also makes for a few surprises along the way. However, her Dr. Kay series is on a rapid decline in terms of subject matter. This particular book is the victim of decline, but is still good. <br />   On the tiny and closely knit Tangier Island, a woman has died at the hands of a strange new killer. Dr. Kay Scarpetta has been called in to investigate. Early in the investigation, the killer contacts her via AOL with the frightening screen name DEADOC. They give her a virtual tour of a gruesome scene. With little to go on, Dr. Kay faces a new breed of killer. Moreover, she could be next...<br />   This book is not the best, but it is a good read. It deals with a variety of issues aside from the crime aspect. It deals with homosexuality (a recurring theme in Cornwell's latest works),AIDS, vulnerability, and betrayal. If any of these topics bother you, I would not advise reading this novel. However, if you are an avid Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, or just enjoy good reading buy UNNATURAL EXPOSURE today.	2001-05-16

All in  all, an excellent book, by an excellent author.	2000-03-09
