It's so vivid, indelible -- U'll feel like U've met this person. There's even a happy ending. It makes 4 an amazing, rewarding mind-movie.

Martin short-story packages, there R a few new stories -- &quot;Nightflyers&quot; is a very good, very vivid interstellar horror story, with a lot more going 4 it than just the mystery at its center -- good believable characters, involving happenings, &amp; most of all the Volcryn, another haunting creation of George at his very best. &quot;Nor the Many-Colored Fires of a Star Ring&quot; is a sequel to George's earlier story &quot;The Second Kind of Loneliness,&quot; &amp; is also outstanding. &quot;Weekend in a War Zone&quot; is average, nothing special. The other stories include his classic &quot;Song for Lya&quot; (which U should already have read), &quot;Override,&quot; &amp; a couple others. Worth it just 4 the stories U can't find elsewhere.	2002-08-20

If only &quot;For a Breath I Tarry,&quot; &quot;Permafrost&quot; &amp; &quot;He Who Shapes&quot; were here, U wouldn't need NE other Zelazny books.

Shiner balances his narrator's personal life &amp; problems (dead father, crumbling marriage, lost feeling, new love in his life) with the music that gives meaning 2 it all 4 him. Perhaps most impressive R the glimpses of famous rock &amp; roll stars -- The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix -- Shiner gets U up close 2 all these greats, &amp; HE DOESN'T BLOW THE IMPORTANT DETAILS. U'll feel like U've MET these people, &amp; every moment of Bing close 2 them rings true. U'll B there when their music is created, C where it comes from, &amp; know what it means -- 2 all music fans. Hallucinatory, vivid, brilliant -- would make a heckuva movie. Shiner's got the music in him. U will LOVE this book. Clearly, the greatest rock and roll novel EVER.	2002-08-20

Now THIS is where I thot George started seriously slipping (if it wasn't when I saw the small amount of new work in his previous collection, NIGHTFLYERS). There is 1 good new story here -- \\"In the Lost Lands.\\" It has the mood & magic of so many of George's early greats. Some of the other stories R recycled from George's earlier collections: it's a pleasure 2 C \\"With Morning Comes Mistfall,\\" \\"Second Kind of Loneliness,\\" & \\"Lonely Songs of Laren Door\\" again, & they certainly brighten up this package. \\"Unsound Variations\\" is a pretty good chess story. \\"Under Seige\\" is pretty solid, 2. But the others R mostly disappointments. \\"Portraits of His Children\\" won a Nebula Award, & tho it's a vivid series of character sketches, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. It's tuff 2 keep crankin out greats at the low rates of pay in the SF field. Is that why George took a 10-year vacation to TV?	2002-08-20

A flood of poetic images fills a funny, fast-paced story that may B a retelling of the myth of Theseus -- but U won't care. Delany's odd eye, great sense of humor &amp; different look at things will B enuf. &amp; parts of it R laff-out-loud funny. At 120 pages, U can read it in a couple hours. &amp; if U like this, try EMPIRE STAR and really scramble yr brain....	2002-08-20

This is worth it all 4 \\"For a Breath I Tarry,\\" which is 1 of my all-time faves -- words fail me; it's hilarious, heart-wrenching; it'll change your world in 25 pages. \\"He Who Shapes\\" (aka \\"The Dream Master\\") is also outstanding. Also solid: \\"The Last Defender of Camelot,\\" & a romantic heart-wringer called \\"The Engine at Heartspring's Center.\\" There R many others which R at LEAST worth reading. Zelazny was a poet; I miss him. If U like him, U might also try early George R.R. Martin, early Samuel R. Delany, & some of Robert Silverberg's mellower work (like DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH, DYING INSIDE, THE BOOK OF SKULLS).	2002-08-20

A couple others R merely average, nothing 2 get Xcited about. But the best stuff here is some of George's best work.	2002-08-20

Bit of a disappointing Nding, but....<BR>RZ takes the Egyptian pantheon of Gods & has fun with them, much as he did in LORD OF LIGHT, only this 1's funnier. Slow, odd start, but 1nce U get in2 it, U'll have a great time with the larger-than-life battles Btween mythical heroes & villians, the poetry Zelazny throws in2 the story with no advance warning, the fun the characters make of all the hero-story stereotypes -- U'll love it. Zelazny clearly loved a good joke. My favorite section is headed \\"Marachek,\\" & includes the world's LONGEST run-on sentence -- I had a great time. But B warned -- this ain't no AMBER novel -- it's WAY BETTER....	2002-08-20

This multiplex, mind-scrambling narrative is (along with EINSTEIN INTERSECTION) Delany's best novel. Only about 100 pages, filled with dazzling, vivid images &amp; fun characters -- it's fresh, funny, complicated &amp; FAST -- a &quot;space opera&quot; of epic proportions ... in a tight space. U'll have a great time. Some of Delany's philosophical Deep Thots come across 2, but U won't mind.

Martin's early short stories. But the quality varies. &quot;Song for Lya&quot; itself is a moving, involving, vivid, haunting, 5-star CLASSIC, &amp; is reason enuf 4 buying the book all by itself. Also very good R &quot;With Morning Comes Mistfall,&quot; &quot;Second Kind of Loneliness,&quot; &amp; &quot;Override.&quot; Some of the rest is disappointing: &quot;The Hero&quot; was Martin's 1st-published story, &amp; it's ... not bad. &quot;FTA&quot; is a brief joke. &quot;Slide Show&quot; features a series of dazzling images, but it's not much of a STORY. &quot;Exit to San Breta&quot; is an OK haunted-car story on a freeway of the future. &quot;Dark Were the Tunnels&quot; has a WAY better (&amp; longer) sequel in George's SANDKINGS collection. But the best stuff here shows what George could do 1nce he hit his stride, &amp; is a good curtain-raiser 4 some of the great stuff U'll find in his other collections.	2002-08-19

DYING OF THE LIGHT (originally called AFTER THE FESTIVAL in its 1st appearance in 1977 in Analog magazine) echoes many of George R.R. Martin's early themes -- lost love, devotion, romantic fantasy vs. grim reality, dark & moody settings, finding heroism within yrself, etc. DOTL also shares the same setting & background of many of Martin's early short stories, which will add 2 Njoyment of the novel 4 his fans. Wonderful setting, marvelous characters, great hand-to-hand combat & fierce emotions among believable characters, & a gorgeous heroic ending. George shoulda kept writing like this. Other great early stuff by Martin: WINDHAVEN (with Lisa Tuttle), the short-story collections SANDKINGS, A SONG FOR LYA, SONGS OF STARS AND SHADOWS and NIGHTFLYERS, and parts of THE ARMAGGEDDON RAG. I wish he'd written a couple more SF novels B4 moving 2 TV & what he calls \\"the big fat fantasy novels\\" he's writing now. I've bn a Martin fan since '74 -- glad some other folks finally caught on. But I find his early stuff has a romantic sense of mood, vision & soul that his newer work lacks....	2002-08-18

MayB it's not really a horror novel in the classic sense -- no ghosts or vampires, just people being their usual dark unpredictable selves. But when somebody gets hurt in this book, U will hurt. Everything from the setting, characters &amp; happenings to Koja's brilliant, abrupt, feverishly vivid writing style will hook U, involve U, &amp; guarantee U'll have an unforgettable reading Xperience. This woman should be on the best-seller lists. The best novel I've ever read. Also great by Koja: THE CIPHER, BAD BRAINS, STRANGE ANGELS, KINK. Her short-story collection EXTREMETIES also has a few outstanding, visionary items in it. If U're a horror reader, U need to pick up Koja's work.	2002-08-03
