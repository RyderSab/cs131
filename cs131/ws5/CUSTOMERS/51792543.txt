This is the best mystery ever written and I have read all the others. I suffered through their illogical plot twists, characters and facts introduced in the last 10 pages, hackneyed conversations, impossible and incorrect technical events, enemies turned best friends for no reason, and actions totally out of character.<br /><br />None of that here. Ten people go to an island and all end up dead and no one knows who is responsible. I read it twice and did not have any idea. Then a clever literary tactic is employed to reveal the secret. It all fits together perfectly, there were clues, I should have figured it out, but Dame Christie is too good and too clever for any of us.<br /><br />The 10 Indians are all implicated in crimes for which they can not be punished in a court so instead they will receive their just rewards in this world and the next on this forsaken island.<br /><br />But what to do when a majority of your housemates are already dead? Whom do you trust to form a possible alliance? Finally, what if it is you and one other person whom you thought you could trust. Pay particular attention to the nursery rhyme reference to the red herring.<br /><br />Read the book and skip the film. There have been several versions, mostly under the title of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. In a fit of sheer irresponsibility and lunacy, the movie makers changed the ending. They thought it would be more clever and easier to film, but they were wrong. Why mess with perfection?	2005-09-30

It is obvious that he never quite finished it, because it is little more than a short story, and it lacks a second act. It is a clever literary mechanism, constructing, evaluating, and analyzing one's life within a baseball game, but I am sure Michael would have liked to work on it some more. Eventually it was found by son Jeff, who has at this point has surpassed his father's literary output. Jeff had the manuscript published, apparently without any modifications, and it later served as the basis for the Kevin Costner-Kelly Preston film of the same name. <br /> <br />No one is a bigger fan of the Shaaras' work than I, but this is not the best of the lot. The ending of the book is a bit hokey and not too well-explained. The screenwriters for the film understood this and changed the ending, and added many characters and plot lines. Actually it is not a bad film, despite the uneven performance of Miss Preston, and Kevin Costner being way too old, even for an aging ball player, and not athletic or fit enough. <br /> <br />Billy Chapel is an old school ballplayer, 17 years pitching for the same team (never identified in the book, the Detroit Tigers in the film). He is a superstar, heading for the Hall of Fame, when he finds out very late in the season, that he is to be traded. He is to pitch that day against the hated Yankees, and even though his team has been long eliminated from contention, Chapel plans to give his best performance on what could be his last day.  <br /> <br />Complicating all this baseball business is his strange relationship with Jane, an aspiring editor, who told him that morning they are through, since he does not really need her, in her view. Chapel's relationship with this woman has lasted for years, but been very non-committal and unstructured.  <br /> <br />Of course, Chapel pitches well on this day at Yankee Stadium, he is clearly in the zone. Inning by inning, we learn the backstory, how hisfather taught him the game, the early deaths of his parents, how the business end of baseball changed in nearly two decades, and his relationship with the former team owner. His relationship with Jane is explained from the first meeting, including their rules of engagement.  <br /> <br />After the game, Chapel has another discussion with Jane. That is about it for the book. The movie is considerably fleshed out with additional characters like Vince Scully (he is nearly a co-star as he broadcasts the game for Fox), Steve \\"Psycho\\" Lyons (who is as forgettable as an announcer as he was as a player), Jane's daughter and her father, the team trainer, the old and new owners, and a rookie Yankee player who is the son of a former Chapel teammate. To make it even more interesting the film adds a sub-plot with Chapel suffering an injury, Jane playing a key role in preventing it from becoming life-threatening, Chapel treating her badly, and Chapel eventually returning to form. <br /> <br />The book has some issues that will bother baseball fans, like Chapel batting in an AL park where the DH would be in effect, and a line-up with an inconsistent order. None of that really matters, and is all throughly fixed in the film. Actual MLB umpires appear as do former players, though not of any note.  <br /> <br />Just for fun, the film includes a Jose Canseco-type player, who fields fly balls off his head. Fortunately there is no appearance by steroids or Madonna (speaking of aging stars from Detroit).  <br />	2005-09-18

Wodehouse in the Bertie and Jeeves series. This collection of five short stories is wonderfully read by the always entertaining and expressive Alexander Spencer. I can imagine that Wodehouse wrote for a gentleman's ear, so do yourself the honor of listening to this narration. <br /> <br />In one case I can wholeheartedly agree with Tony Blair. In a recent interview he lauded Wodehouse, saying that there is something laugh out loud funny on each page. Hard to know when the next page starts on an audio book, but certainly true here. <br /> <br />From the books and television programs, everyone knows the bumbling well-intentioned Bertie and his super problem solving butler Jeeves. Here both characters are fleshed out a great deal as they go about, spreading sweetness and light. We learn that Jeeves matches wits with the local shrimp on his August vacation, and enjoys the receipt of a gratuity for a job well done, at least to a point. Bertie's endless list of relatives grows longer with each story, as does their penchant for insulting and underestimating him.  <br /> <br />In this collection, Jeeves and Bertie take on food Nazis, vicious rugby players, dog girls from the country, elderly gentlemen intent on reining in the excessive behavior of young boys, American soup manufacturers, and oversized advertising posters bearing Bertie's likeness.  In all cases, a solution is reached, generally agreeable to the injured, the relations, and perhaps less so, to Bertie.  <br /> <br />Get this audiocassette and take along on your next interminable commute or trip to the in-laws.	2005-09-05

Ian Fleming penned 14 Bond adventures before his death in 1964. He lived to see the first few movies made, was hopelessly smitten with the young Ursula Andress, and fortunately did not live to see the excesses of his sucessors.  <br /> <br />This book is a compilation of three short stories in Octopussy, The Living Daylights, and Property of a Lady. There is no real resemblance to the similarly titled films, but some of the scenes and characters from the short stories made it to the big screen.  <br /> <br />These stories show what Bond would do on a slow day, no gadgets or romance involved. Bond does not entertain three women per story, in fact, he meets none. He is smitten at a distance with a cello player, but nothing develops romantically, and the female lead of the third story is described as unattractive.  <br /> <br />Bond simply closes out a few files, as one might do in a short week before heading out on holiday. Of course, M and Ms. Moneypenny appear here, with M and the unnamed Chief of Staff providing Bond with his orders and accoutrements.  <br /> <br />Octopussy is the best of the lot here. In fact, Bond barely appears in the story set in Fleming's beloved Jamaica about 15 years after the war. A British army major comes into a treasure in the closing chaotic days of the war in Europe. His techniques included murder and eventually he is tracked down by 007 who had been an acquaintance of the \\"Good German\\" victim. <br /> <br />The Living Daylights features a challenge between two trained assassins, which will be familiar to viewers of the Timothy Dalton film. Fleming very cleverly sets the scene at Checkpoint Charlie just before the Wall went up. Both sides use innovative cover to muffle their killer's sounds and movements. We get a real sense of the unpleasant side of the business, as Bond's portfolio is murder. He does not relish the assignment, in fact, he speaks of a preference for demotion, drinks whiskey before the event, and fails to complete allparts of the assignment.   <br /> <br />Property of a Lady is a primer on Faberge with the famous auction scene, brought to the big screen in a Roger Moore film. Rather than lamely stealing the real article, Bond uses the event to better ends. Here Bond shows more initiative and insight than M in flushing out an important Soviet agent while keeping a useful double agent in place.	2005-08-26

Who needs Jeeves and never mind those stupid pro-Nazi Wodehouse ramblings, this is the real thing. Every page has some serious laugh out loud stuff to it. <br /> <br />First Lord Ickenham initiates some serious soul-searching and literary output from a former class-mate, Beefy Bastable, by slyly knocking his hat off his head as he looks for a taxi. Then to make it even more fun, he encourages poor Beefy in this pursuit by assuring him that he is not capable of writing a novel. The over-worked barrister then pens a blockbuster about how the younger generation lacks discipline, vision, and morality. When bishops decry the racy bits from the pulpit, the novel becomes a success and Hollywoood comes calling for the movie rights. <br /> <br />Now Wodehouse really rolls up his sleeves. Ickenham intervenes in four on-again, off-again romances, putting them all right in the end. The paternity of Cocktail Time becomes a bit confused, as several claim the authorship (Bastable used a nom de plume as he did not want the outcry over the novel to affect his goal of standing for Parliament as a Conservative). Additional loopy characters such as Young Mr. Saxby and the elusive Flannery drop in. <br /> <br />Good light reading, take it to the beach and enjoy.	2005-07-31

Scott's classic tale of the Crusade is a product of his Victorian times with endless hidden relationships and disguises reminiscent of Dickens' Pickwick Papers. No one is who you think they are and if they are, they aren't on the side you expected. Also, there are no battles, this is a Crusade of philosophical discussions, mystery, scientific discovery, romance, crime, and mistaken identity.  <br /> <br />Richard of England has tenuous leadership of a band of Templars, Scotsmen, French, German, and assorted mercenaries in a Holy Crusade to recover Jerusalem from the Infidels. During the time of this story, a truce is in place and Richard is near death with a mysterious fever. As this was a time of great patriotic fervor, trouble breaks out in the allied camps when various national flags are desecrated. All part of a plan for the other allied leaders to become supreme over the near-dead Richard.  <br /> <br />Fortunately, Richard recovers with the help of an Infidel medical man. To really liven things up, the Royal women then join the camp, including Richard's charming young consort. Various alliances are contemplated, all including marriage proposals as their contractual binder. A very brave young Scotsman turns out to be a person of greater standing than advertised.  <br /> <br />All in all, a very enjoyable novel. Dont expect to learn any actual history from Scott. It is not true that Richard and Saladin were allied, however briefly, against the Templars and the Austrians. It is true that all held Richard in great respect and that the Infidels were very advance in the scientific and medical arts.          <br /> <br />	2005-07-16

During this time, the brothers worked diligently to explain the benefits of aviation to an unbelieving public and uninterested leaders of military and commercial concerns.  <br /> <br />Kelly starts at the beginning, with tales of the brothers as young children and schoolboys, ultimately moving into the world of commerce as circus impressarios, printers, and bicycle builders and repairmen.  <br /> <br />By the late 1890's they had selected aviation as a hobby, and started their annual pilgrimages to Kitty Hawk for several months each year to perform experiments. Only after 4 or 5 years of gliding and kite flying, was manned flight considered. By working long hours in the bicycle shop and minimizing all expenses, they were able to pursue this unusual hobby for several weeks each fall.    <br /> <br />The obstacles were legendary, but the brothers persevered, usually by arguing (in a friendly way) between themselves, then reading every book on the subject in the Dayton public library, and then, developing new theories and experimental methods. In this way, they broke new ground in fluid dynamics, control and stability, motor construction, and propeller design. For example, they discovered that published tables of data on wind dynamics were wrong, so they built a wind tunnel to generate better data. The brothers had a unique ability to solve problems by applying a sound scientific approach and by going about it in an honest midwestern approach. <br /> <br />Those of us who were at the centennial did not hear the story of how little publicity the 1903 flight received. The press and public were either unbelieving, or unable to distinguish between flying dirigibles and heavier than air self propelled planes. Only after several public demonstrations with flights exceeding one hour did the popular press come to understand the importance of this development.  <br /> <br />Kelly's book is unique in its access to Orville Wright, as they were old friends and Kelly consulted extensively with him, writing this book in the 1940's. After Wilbur died, Orville focused on building the various Wright companies around the world, fighting patent infringement suits (including Curtis), and endless battles with the Smithsonian Institute.  <br /> <br />The Smithsonian story is told here in great detail, as Orville still sought for the historical record to reflect his view, now universally accepted. The Langely plane (Langely was the director of the Smithsonian) never flew; in fact, it crashed several times in the Potomac in 1902-03, and had obvious design flaws.  <br /> <br />Amazingly, Glen Curtis was allowed to attempt experiments years later with the Langely plane, while he had litigation pending over the Wright patents. Curtis made major modifications to the plane, and got it to briefly fly, thus attempting to weaken the Wright patent claims. For years, the Smithsonian stubbornly insisted that the Langely plane was historically significant, and snubbed the Wright brothers, who retaliated by displaying their planes in other museums.	2005-07-16
US	51792543	R1HRUTRLDKNME7	0375701974	531318079	THE GOOD MAN OF NANKING: The Diaries of John Rabe	Books	5	43	43	N	N	Nanking's Nazi Buddha	John Rabe was a German businessman, living and working in Nanking when the Japanese invaded and conquered the city in 1937. Rabe had lived in China for 30 years and had risen to the position of senior agent for the German conglomerate, Siemens. He was tasked with selling industrial equipment to the Chinese government, enabling the construction and maintenance of electrical, water, phone, and health care facilities.  <br /> <br />As it became clear that Nanking would fall quickly to the invading Japanese army, most Westerners, including Rabe's wife, left for Hong Kong or other safer locations. Rabe chose to stay in Nanking, feeling it his duty to look out for the interests of Siemens and its local stafff. Realizing that Nanking was essentially indefensible and that the Japanese army was bent on ruthless behavior, Rabe and some others, mostly American missionaries, formed an organization to protect refugees and non-combatants.  <br /> <br />Rabe was named the head of this International Committee and set out to build international support for the formation of a refugee zone. Ultimately more than 200,000 residents of Nanking were housed in this refugee zone, including about 600 on the grounds of Rabe's own home. Rabe fought the good fight with building support for the zone, communicating regularly with all the embassies and officials, even writing to Hitler at one point. Many attribute the International Committee's work with saving thousands of Chinese lives.  <br /> <br />This book is primarily Rabe's diaries. He made entries nearly every day during the 4 months in 1937-1938 that he was in Nanking under Japanese domination. Some additional information to explain the historical context is provided by the author. Rabe quit writing diaries during the war, then restarted with the fall of Berlin.  <br /> <br />Rabe spares no detail to describe the inhumane behavior of the Japanese army in Nanking, often including officers. The most horrible rapes, tortures, and murders became commonplace. Japanese soldiers raped young girls with their parents watching, then murdered the lot with bayonets. Nearly every building was looted several times, then frequently burned with the inhabitants inside.  <br /> <br />Since Japan and Germany were already allied at this time, Japanese soldiers would give Rabe himself some respect, especially when he waved his Nazi armband and flew his Nazi flag. The other Westerners suffered more, as the Japanese showed no respect for the American or British flags or embassies. <br /> <br />Like many Germans living abroad in the 1930's, Rabe was a Nazi party member. He seems unaware of Nazi atrocities or vile actions, and joined the party primarily because doing so enabled German government financial support for a school that he helped establish in China.  <br /> <br />The parallels to Oskar Schindler are clear. Both were party members who accomplished great humanitarian goals in a difficult time. One could draw the distinction that unlike Rabe, Schindler was aware of Nazi atrocities and probably benefited financially from his wartime activities. <br /> <br />Rabe came to regret his Nazi party membership upon his return to Germany. As a party member, after the war he was generally unable to work. At times, the Siemens corporation and individual excecutives would do small favors for Rabe. Very late in his life, he was de-Nazified.  <br /> <br />Rabe also had terrible timing; he left war-torn China and made his home in Berlin, suffering under Russian atrocities and near-starvation starting in 1944. Ironically Rabe had been briefly imprisoned and questioned by the Gestapo after he wrote another letter to Hitler about Japanese behavior in China. Rabe received some aid from the Chinese Nationals when Madame Chang Kai Shek heard of his predicament in Berlin.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good read. The diary style is a little unusual, as Rabe was clearly writing for himself and his family, and not the general public.He is an excellent author with a keen sense of humor and his role in extraordinary times. The last part of the diaries, set in Berlin under Russian occupation show Rabe depressed and afraid, not knowing how he will support his family.	2005-05-21
US	51792543	R2DBV68GOTC0MH	0142002038	816153289	Doctor No (James Bond Novels)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	From Jamaica With Love	Ian Fleming's Dr. No is early James Bond fun, one of the first novels and the first film. The Bond character is not yet fully stylized into the high tech gadget-loving, multi-lingual, card-playing, three women per film character that we know from the films. However the lovable vices such as the vodka martini and the pistol in the shoulder holster, are already well established.   <br /> <br />In fact we see glimpses of another side of Bond, especially early on when Bond is nearly drummed out of the 00 branch. Remember that From Russia With Love immediately preceded Dr. No, and Bond had nearly died from the shoe-tip poison injection.  <br /> <br />Bond had spent months in hospital and M was unsure that he was fit for return to full duty, so he sent him to Jamaica to close out a few loose ends on what was thought to be a minor Human Resources problem. M saw this as an extension of the rest and relaxation period, a point which Bond uncharaceristically later mocks M about in his communique to the office. <br /> <br />Bond spreads about some cash and assembles the old team in Jamaica. He quickly discovers that the real story is homocide and terrorism, not an aging colleague taking off with a vivacious young assistant. Of course Bond makes his way to a tropical paradise where he meets Dr. No, his dragon, and the unforgettable Honeychild Rider, played by Ursula Andress in the film. The famous stunt in the film, where the good guys hide in the lagoon breathing through bamboo sticks, turns out to have actually been Honey's idea.   <br /> <br />It is always interesting to me as a fan of both the novels and the films to see where they went different directions in telling the story. Most unfortunately, Honey appears in the novel without her famous bikini. Interestingly she has a disfiguring broken nose, one souvenir of a very difficult life as a Jamaican orphan, descended from supporters of the Restoration.  She also has quite a store of knowledge of local plants and animals, much of which turns out to be quite useful in her adventures with Bond.  <br /> <br />Dr. No's occupation has also changed from guano farmer/missile expert in the novel, to some kind of poorly defined nuclear scientist in the film.  <br /> <br />No is one of the better villains, and he gets a chance, over a long dinner, to tell his story. He had been a big-league gangster in both China and America, and has actually earned medical degrees. He was accused correctly of theft, had his hands cut off to mark him as such, and was shot in the chest and left for dead. Fortunately for No, he was the one man in a million whose heart is on the wrong side and he survived the shooting.  <br /> <br />Read the book, see the film again and enjoy a glimpse of the early Bond years. Some comical characters, such as the governor, from the Edwardian era still populate the gentry of the final days of the colonial times.	2005-05-03

Martin Cruz Smith brings his unusual Russian detective back for a fourth time in Havana Bay, set in Cuba during the special period of the late 90's. Fortunately for Renko, he is not aging as fast as the rest of us, since it has been a full two decades since he first appeared on the scene.  <br /> <br />Renko has been fully through the cycle at least twice now, from star of the Moscow prosecutor's office to hopeless outcast. And for a Russian to be down on his luck, that is truly a state reminiscent of a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich. Renko attempts without success some things in this novel, that are truly out of character for the fighter and survivor that he has shown himself to be.  <br /> <br />One almost gets the sense that Smith has grown weary of Renko, and wants to get rid of him in an inappropriate way (similar to Conan Doyle dumping Holmes over a cliff in Switzerland) so that he can get on with his life's work. Fortunately for us, and unfortunately for Smith, his non-Renko books haven't sold, so we will have Renko to kick around a bit longer.    <br /> <br />Havana Bay starts out mildly enough. A former associate of Renko, one of the last of the Stalinist patriots and a spy, is found dead in Cuba, maybe murdered. Renko agrees to go to Cuba to identify and return home with the body.  <br /> <br />Ultimately he does that, but it is not a linear progression. First he encounters anti-revolutionaries and revolutionaries, corrupt and violent police, beautiful policewoman working undercover in vice, religious cults, demolition experts turned mechanics, fishermen employing unorthodox techniques, and Americans on the lam trolling for investment opportunities from Capone's yacht and Hemingway's Cadillac.   <br /> <br />This is the time of the special period. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Cuba finds herself lacking allies and sponsors. Russians become very sparse and more hated than Americans. Renko crosses paths with the best characters in the story, twoof the 84 Americans living in exile on the island. One hijacked a plane to Cuba 20 years ago, and has not figured out what to do since, and the other is a Robert Vesco type financier on the run from the US law, planning real estate developments in Havana.  <br /> <br />Renko should have known he was in trouble when his hosts start introducing him as the new Russian, since the last Russian turned up dead. But of course, he puts all the pieces together, despite resistance and worse from the authorities. He even witnesses the last supper, where the menu was lobster or nothing, and even those ordering the lobster would not eat or drink.	2005-04-18
US	51792543	R1HUCMNH83MZDW	0785260463	856576592	Breaking the Da Vinci Code: Answering the Questions Everybody's Asking	Books	5	49	52	N	N	Decode This, DaVinci	Professor Bock has written a fascinating historical analysis of the early Christian era, focusing on the seven codes found in the best-selling thriller by Dan Brown, The DaVinci Codes. <br /> <br />His explanation of the theological view of the Gnostics is perhaps the most enlightening. The Gnostics were a now-forgotten early Christian group, that postulated the road to Heaven was through intense study, knowledge, and enlightment, which were only achieved by a select group of intellectuals. They also generally viewed Jesus and Christ as two entities, seeing a separation between the Savior and the man.  <br /> <br />Clearly these Gnostic views are almost unrecognizable to \\"orthodox\\" Christians of our era, where salvation is based on belief and forgiveness of sin, and God had one Son who suffered on the cross. However, Brown's characters lean heavily on them. <br /> <br />Professor Bock also delves deeply into the code that says Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a blood line that extends to modern France.  <br /> <br />These are not new theories. The French descendants have been talking about this for centuries. Many other books in the last 20 years have expressed this. Even the 1970's musical Jesus Christ Superstar, now endorsed by the Vatican, hints at a relationship beyond that of teacher and apostle. However, Bock analyzes carefully all Biblical and non-Biblical sources and finds no evidence whatsoever that Jesus was married or had descendants. This seems to be the one fact that all Biblical scholars agree upon.  <br /> <br />The other DaVinci codes are similarly dissected in great historical perspective, involving every known source, and all are found to be lacking. Dan Brown has written an interesting thriller, but it has no basis in history, as the Vatican is now proclaiming as well.     <br /> <br />For example, Brown's characters claim the church is anti-women, when in fact, Jesus included women in his ministry, delivered much revelation to them, and had them observe the crucifixion and the resurrection. Mary Magdalene and the other women were the apostles to the apostles with respect to the resurrection. <br /> <br />The DaVinci codes also claim that the early church fathers rewrote history as late as 400 years after Christ, to suit their purposes. This area seems to be Bock's real specialty, as he quotes many sources to confirm that the four gospels were established and Jesus was the saviour long before any secretive 4th century gathering. He also gives a fascinating account of how the four gospels came to be written and the relationships between their writers and the early Christians and apostles.  <br /> <br />There seems to be zero historical basis for one of Brown's characters claiming that the 4 known gospels were selected from 80 potential gospels. <br /> <br />In sum, I recommend that all who want to understand how Christianity evolved, and also enjoy a good popular thriller, take the opportunity to pick up a lesson in history and theology from Professor Bock. I read many parts of this text several times, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  <br /> <br />The DaVinci Codes are like the Umberto Eco novels in that one needs some outside historical context to really enjoy the work. By the way, Eco has also studied the DaVinci codes and reached the same conclusions as Professor Bock.	2005-03-27

A talented cast presents the only Holmes plays written by his creator, Sir Authur Conan Doyle.  <br /> <br />In Sherlock Holmes, our hero fends off various nefarious plans launched by his nemasis, Professor Moriarity, the head of the London crime syndicate. Holmes even develops a love interest.  <br /> <br />In the second play, The Speckled Band, Holmes solves an old murder and prevents a second one. The Anglo-Indian doctor has unusual habits, a mean disposition, surly servants and dog, and a propensity for seeing unhappy outcomes to the women left in his charge. Fortunately, Watson knew the family in India, and brings Holmes into the picture at the right time.  <br /> <br />Then we have the little extra treat. Ghastly Double Murder in Famed Detectives's Flat is a more recent comedic play involving the Doyle characters, written by Yuri Rasovsky. This shows us what happens when the spotlight is turned off, as many new twists encircle Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Watson, and the long-suffering housekeeper. In this short story, Holmes elects an early retirement, as the current cases and criminals no longer hold his attention. Watson foresees his own demise, as he is broke, in debt to nefarious characters, and has already sold book rights that Holmes will never grant. The landlady realizes no one other than Holmes will pay the rent that has enabled her lifestyle all these years. She and Watson team up to stop Holmes' retirement with a surprising outcome.	2005-03-26

Probably unique in his approach, Shaara was a focused student of a single three day event, and not a general interest historian, turning out volumes of thousand page tomes covering entire wars and the generations that preceded them.  <br /> <br />Shaara's key contribution was simple: he brought the characters to life and told a human story. Chamberlain attacked when he could no longer defend the flank. Buster was not even from this country, he drank excessively, but was the greatest confidante a young leader could want. Longstreet knew it was all hopeless, especially arguing with the boss. Hill challenged Longstreet to a duel to defend his honor. Longstreet wanted Stuart courtmartialed for not folowing orders, but again knew what would never happen. Another general charged suicidally to forever erase an unfair charge made by the long-dead Jackson. Sickels the politician was incapable of following orders, lucky to have gotten away with murder once, and too inexperienced to see the danger in giving up the good ground without a fight. The European observers, dressed in bizarre hats, thought Lee was a genius and an unparalled leader, especially when they learned he attended the Anglican Church in Arlington.    <br /> <br />Hard-core Civil War historians hate this dramatization and novelization Shaara employed. Clearly he is only imaging what Lee told Stuart upon his return, or what Longstreet thought as he made his long solitary rides. This technique might not work for others in other situations, but it does the trick here.   <br /> <br />Fortunately for us, Ted Turner intervened to turn \\"The Killer Angels\\" into a very good movie, with the dedicated re-enactors and the Park Service cooperating at an unprecedented level.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately for us, Ted appears briefly in the film, but waits until \\"Gods and Generals\\" to give himself an extended speaking part. Jane Fonda does not appear in either film, as neither side in the Civil War was sufficiently leftist for her tastes; the teachings of Marx and Engels not yet widely available.   <br /> <br />Being a Pennsylvania Dutchman myself, I always had a special interest and unique perspective on what transpired in that quiet Pennsylvania town, where I have been many times.  <br /> <br />In some ways, things in 1863 were not that different from today. Washington bureacucrats had made a terrible mess of the various then-current political issues such as states' rights, slavery, democracy, the role of federal government, etc. until actual hostilities broke out. Ultimately, the Washingtonians made a mess of running the war as well, losing many battles despite an overwhelming superiority in nearly all resources. Then the war came to Pennsylvania. Someone had the sense to put Pennsylvanians, Meade and Reynolds, briefly in charge, and the thing was resolved satisfactorily in three days.  <br /> <br />The rebels were chased out of Pennsylvania, where they became someone else's problem. The war was effectively ended at Gettysburg, but the CSA kept at it for an additional two years, living on a hope and a prayer. Finally Lee realized that even back home in Virginia, he could not raise an offensive, had no supplies, no allies, and no option other than to go see Grant. Then Davis left town dressed in woman's clothes, and it was all over, except the shouting, and the next 100 years or so of rebuilding.	2005-03-16

This stuff is good, written in 1953, even if you are like me and don't like science fiction. Pass on those Bush-bashing movies by disingenuous poorly dressed film-makers and go to the real thing. <br /> <br />This Fahrenheit is called 451 because that is the temperature at which books burn, more or less, and that is what this is about. Reminiscent of Hitlerian Germany, book burning is back in vogue in the eastern US in the late 20th century. The first ironic twist is that the firemen start the fires to burn the books, generally engulfing the book owner's home, and sometimes the book owner as well.  <br /> <br />Guy Montag is a third generation fireman who starts to question the purpose and meaning in burning books. All homes have been somehow fireproofed, so no real fires occur, only those started by the fire department. Montag's wife sits home all day, watching mindless broadcasts on large screens, and complaining that Guy needs to earn more money in order to purchase even larger screens. Her ultimate objective is to cover all four walls of the living room with monitors.  <br /> <br />Guy starts to sneak home some of the books and of course, he ultimately becomes the target of his own department. He learns that he should not trust his wife or his colleagues, all of whom long ago drank the kool-aid. He does make the acquaintance of an elderly professor, an intellectual and scholar from the old days, who ultimately puts him in touch with others of a similar ilk.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most interesting is the reason givien for burning the books. Non-fiction is bad, since it is all contradictory and impossible to prove, and fiction is even worse since it is not even true, just made-up people, places, and dialogue. And dont get me started on poetry or philosophy, that will only cause confusion, sorrow, and feelings of being lost. Society has made a clear selection in its entertainment, with an absolute preference for high speed sports, action, and adventure. <br /> <br />More irony follows as Montag on several occasions becomes both the observer and the target as he is pursued by the authorities. Then we learn from reading a book that books are not a suitable way for humanity to store knowledge, that requires dedicated but powerless and marginalized scholars involved in constant peer review and analysis. The last irony is that Bradbury has written a very short book here, actually a novella, because he knows that we prefer action and adventure to reading. <br /> <br />As of this 2005 writing, I understand that Bradbury is in his 80's and still working. In various interviews, he expressed anger that Michael Moore would adapt his title for a completely unrelated and unfunny diatribe. But then, Bradbury lifted \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" right out of Shakespeare. What comes around, goes around.	2005-02-11

Most of them are not very good and this one is middle of the peloton.  <br /> <br />Armstrong seems to have not thought much about his recent experiences. He seems bewildered when asked several times about his spirituality and how it was impacted by his recovery. His hero is DNA guru Craig Ventner who tells him that heaven and hell only exist on earth. Armstong likes to leave the serious thinking to his ex-wife. At times, he almost slinks back into being a carefree adolescent with no sense of his legacy in sports or his responsibilities. He makes unannounced visits to New York City Firehouses after 9/11 and is amazed that everyone recognizes him and expects much of him.   <br /> <br />When advising other cancer patients, he focuses only on technology and complete trust in one's physicians. To his credit he does everything possible for other cancer patients, especially working through his foundation.         <br /> <br />Armstong barely addresses the end of his marriage (the relationship with the aging diva would come after this writing). He and his wife seem to struggle mightily with work-life issues that affect everyone. They should get easier when you have access to 24 hour nannies, cooks, coaches, assistants, and contractors, fitness clubs, and private jets.  <br /> <br />He has a Hatfield and McCoy type relationship with the innocent people who drew the assignment to pick up his urine for anti-doping testing. Doping allegations in the French press lead to a full French government inquiry. Armstong's reaction to this insult (he is ultimately found innocent after a very long investigation) is to move his off-season base from France to Spain. We may not have heard the end of this issue now that long time team mate Tyler Hamilton is also being investigated.     <br /> <br />Armstong did learn that there are no guarantees on anything and that one needs to get focused and motivated in order to reach a goal. Before cancer, he was regarded as a huge talent who never achieved anything mostly because he did not set goals and had no idea how to execute. Amazingly he returned from battling a cancer that had spread everywhere in his body, to a world class athlete who had not lost even 1% of his ability. His success in this regard is probably unparalleled in history. <br /> <br />There are several positives about this book. First it is very well written, with the skilled hand of Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins evident throughout. On the editing side, it is not as strong. There is a lot of irrelevant material, with endless stories about foundation staffers, high school buddies, and what the USPS team does on off-days (mostly listen to ZZ Top and drink coffee). I can imagine Armstrong and Jenkins arguing about whether more stories of Texas beer drinking, swimming, and barbequing are really necessary.  <br /> <br />Secondly, it does give some insight into how a team is built and the inner machinations of the great cycling races. We meet fascinating characters like team-mates Ekimov and Landis and see how the team is selected.	2005-02-01

Loewen has written two very useful books here, the first a neat compilation of the top ten things that they never explained properly in high school history class and the second, all the cultural, political, and economic reasons why the educational system failed all of us.<br /><br />Even those of us who consider ourselves well-versed in history need this refresher course. Loewen explains why Columbus's journey to the New World was not the first, but more importantly the last, in that it set in place the political and economic systems that we live under today. If they taught that Columbus was a slave-trader whose main contribution was the introduction of diseases that killed millions of indigenous folk, I don't remember that from my days at P.S. 116.<br /><br />Loewen moves on deftly to more recent events, telling who Helen Keller really was (the leader of the American socialist and workers party) and why no one recalls or was ever taught anything about her except her rise from extreme adversity.<br /><br />Then Woodrow Wilson appears, a native son of Virginia who re-introduced 19th century ways into 20th century Princeton and Washington, and did not mind a few foreign adventures along the way. The Russians still remember his meddling in their civil war, but it is long forgotten here. Loewen also enlightens us about the Mormons, John Brown, Jamestown, and the early Thanksgivings.<br /><br />But enough history lessons. Loewen then moves into the area of his passion, which is why the US educational system avoids bad news, indiscretion, avarice, and conflict, and focuses instead on patriotism and the beneficial role of white men. The system is stacked against proper teaching of history for many reasons.<br /><br />Most of the teachers have little education themselves in the subject, many being coaches with other committments. Few have the time or resources to develop their competency and all fear the type of open-ended teaching where they can be shown less than all-knowing.<br /><br />Publishers are focused on best-selling textbooks, which requires acceptance by textbook advisory groups with patriotic and conservative agendas. Textbooks authors are typically college professors with no interaction with their readers and no system in place for peer review. Teachers prefer books with easy to use teaching aids such as pre-built exams, but have minimal say in book selection anyway.<br /><br />Loewen has crafted a book that all who are interested in history and education should read. He is uniquely qualified, being an established historian with long experience in the textbook development, selling, and acceptance processes.own less than all-knowing.  <br /> <br />Publishers are focused on best-selling textbooks, which requires acceptance by textbook advisory groups with patriotic and conservative agendas.

This is a well crafted mystery, with interesting characters, and political intrigue wrapped around fascinating technical legal information. This novel has it all, well-developed characters like the CIA director, the incompetent and dishonest prison official, and the drunken, pathetic lawyer, and a clever intertwining of two seemingly unconnected stories.  <br /> <br />In the first tale, the CIA director decides to put his powers to good use, becoming a president-maker. The plan is to put an unknown congressman in the White House, with the help of a strong defense platform, an unexpected increase in terrorism, and $100 MM in political contributions from defense contractors and shady intermediaries for friendly foreign governments. <br /> <br />In the second tale, three ex-judges co-existing in a country club style federal prison, concoct a scheme to blackmail wealthy men who have shown an unfortunate interest in the alternative lifestyle. Their lawyer, a down on his luck drunk with few prospects, becomes their lifeline to the outside world and their prey.  <br /> <br />Ultimately the two stories intersect, in a rather unusual way. It turns out the three judges are the luckiest people in the world. Crime seems to pay if you hook the right target and the risk of killing the guilty is too high.	2005-01-02

Michelle, the former Olympic champion and Secret Service agent responsible for this mess, decides to spend her otherwise idle time in commiserating with the only other agent in recent years responsible for a bigger mess, Sean King.  <br /> <br />Not coincidentally, King is living nearby, and witnessing a crime spree involving the murders of his client and office assistant, the latter done with his own gun. Eight years earlier King had outdone Michelle by allowing his protectee to be assassinated. Joan, another agent who was with King that day and may have been a contributing factor in the foul-up, also reappears. She is now a private investigator hired to find the kidnapped candidate. The three former agents decide to join forces to solve the two cases, after it becomes clear that the two cases are connected, although they insist on minimal cooperation and outright hostility at times.  <br /> <br />Baldacci carefully provides us with clues, but few will guess the outcome until the last chapter. No one is really whom they appear to be and all have dark secrets and unexpected alliances. Unfortunately the assassin/kidnapper starts to develop into a cartoon character with bizarre motives, unlikely skill sets, and unreasonable influence over his co-conspirators.  <br /> <br />Baldacci makes some minor factual errors (he thinks the Impala was a Buick), but nothing worse than a Tom Clancy thriller. In Split Second, the focus is on weaving together a fascinating, intricate, and difficult to solve murder, leaving character development and dialogue for a later day. Even the main character King is poorly developed. We don't know much more than that he is a wine snob who enjoys boats and water, and has rebuilt a life in rural Virginia as a lawyer. In summary, this is a well crafted who-done-it, perfect for the beach or a lazy winter afternoonin front of the fire.	2004-12-19

Umberto Eco returns with great success to the Middle Ages with a tale of a talented Italian peasant who becomes a favorite at the court of Frederick Barbarossa. Baudolino becomes the adopted son of the Emperor after helping him when lost and impressing him with his skill for languages, story telling, and prophecies. Baudolino attends school in Paris, participates in many military campaigns especially in his native Italy, and ultimately sets out on his own to discover the lost Christian empires of the Far East. Fortunately for us, he ends up in Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade sacking, and relates his life story to an emminent historian. Unfortunately for Baudolino and history, his story is so infused with outrageous lies that the historian decides to disbelieve it all.  <br /> <br />There are two very good stories here. The first is Baudolino's life long friendship and relationship with a group from his school days. They are a diverse group by nationality, religion, and occupation, and ultimately set out on a homeric journey to the East to link up with the fabled Prester John. Along the way and after, they become merchants and manufacturers of religious artifacts, unsurpassed counterfeiters, reluctant crusaders, diplomats, and persons of great influence in the court.  <br /> <br />The second story, probably less interesting, is the mystery surrounding the death of the emperor. There were many with motives and means to kill Frederick, and somehow the quest for the Holy Grail and other antiquities gets tied up with the murder.  <br /> <br />Eco has returned to the successful style and formula he employed in The Name of the Rose. By design, many of the characters are flat and one-dimensional, including one whose real name can not be rememebered, to focus more on the relationship between Baudolino, his women, and Frederick, and the historical context. A very clever literary device is employed, whereby Baudolino tells his story to a respected historian, who is familiar with some of the later events, while the two are engaged in hunkering down during the sack and then ultimately fleeing their common enemies.	2004-12-04

In fact four episodes from the colorful career of Sam McCready, British spy master, are provided and well-crafted. The four tales cover about 10 years and every terrorist and criminal hub in the world, including Libya, Cuba, USSR, the IRA, and East Germany.  <br /> <br />McCready has been deemed expendable, due to his unorthodox and outrageous tactics, in a post Cold War era by very high level political and civil service leaders.  <br /> <br />The typical story line for a prehistoric cold war operative runs like this: Operate a high level Russian spy for many years in an uneasy collaboration with the CIA. Send an overweight, aged, hard drinking West German spy into East Germany to collect a package. With the help of retired smugglers, go yourself into East Germany to retrieve the package when the West German suffers a complete break-down. Of course this needs to be done without any official sanction from the British or West German, while the KGB is also on the trail of the Russian general. Clearly these tactics have no place in the post cold war 1990's, a time of seeming safety and tranquility at least until Iraq invades Kuwait in August 1990. <br /> <br />The fundamental premise here is that McCready has a legal right to a deparmental hearing as a sort of protest of his forced retirement. In the hearing the four spy tales are told. This is a very unusual construct and may not appeal to all. The tales are all good, but not good enough to stand alone as Forsyth novels, and are strangely unrelated, other than that they are four cases successfully solved by our hero. This is also a book for those like me, who love the technical minutae and operational details of the covert trade.	2004-11-21

Bradbury has assembled a collection of generally unrelated vignettes that explore Earth more than Mars.  <br /> <br />Some are outrageously hilarious, such as the tale of the first explorers who are greeted with total indifference by housewives more concerned with baking and cleaning, and minor politicians immersed in righting old wrongs. Finally they are locked up with the other space travellers. <br /> <br />A key theme seems to be the lack of space planning. People randomly decide to emmigrate, or leave their homes under duress. Upon arrival on Mars, they have no idea how to build the society, beyond bringing some of their familiar Earth items, such as luggage shops and hot dog stands.  <br /> <br />The most interesting line followed by several vignettes is the ultimate journey for technology. Robots outlive their designers and computer programs continue to initiate automated devices to fry bacon and make martinis long after the home is deserted.  <br /> <br />Bradbury also deals with the response of the Martians to the invasion. Many are killed by disease as occurred in the colonies in the 17th century. Others fight back with telepathic weapons, conjuring up images of 1920's Ohio, complete with doting grandparents, lemonaide, and trolleys, to disarm the explorers. Less easily comprehended is that many continue to thrive in a parallel world where they are not visible to their rivals.  <br /> <br />This is a good read, everyone needs a chance to reflect on our human journey of exploration and implementation of technology. For those like me, who don't care for science fiction, there is not much of it here, despite the title.  <br />	2004-10-10

Jance has assembled a very formulaic, almost made-for-tv suspense story. If Jim Rockford had been willing to go on a cruise to Alaska, this thin story could have been filmed thirty years ago. <br /> <br />The characters are stereotypical and the whole plot revolves around clumsy situations of mistaken identity. The protanganist is Beau Beaumont, straight from central casting, a washed-out police detective, who lost his partner and two wives, but appears to be winning a battle with sobriety. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for the reader, but perhaps fortunately for Beau, he agrees to chaperone his ancient grandparents on a cruise. Of course, the trip includes stops in places where his grandfather had fished commercially 50 years ago, and old friends are found on every street corner. Next a murder occurs on the ship, but it is not really a murder, as another of Beau's new forty-something friends seems to have aquatic abilities, on a par with Mark Spitz, and finds her way to safety.  <br /> <br />Of course this thing is full to the brim with tales of adultry, jealousy, new love, dementia, substance abuse, domestic abuse, right-wing conspiracy, and seasickness, much of which happened many years ago, or is totally irrelevant to the plot.  <br /> <br />Birds of Prey might be suitable for very light beach reading, especially if you have a lot of kids to watch and find it difficult to concentrate, as this does not require much effort. By the middle of the book, you will have it figured out, and be wondering what is taking Beau and Jance so long to wrap it up.	2004-09-26

In this first appearance, the soon to be husband and wife team of Tommy and Tuppence cast off their post-war boredom by hiring themselves out as adventurers.<br /><br />They soon find themselves Britain's only hope against an unbelievable collection of thugs, unionists, and socialists bent on destroying the empire in ways that can only be spoken of in whispers. The chrismatic yet unknown Mr. Brown is behind all of this, and no one knows who he is. Join our heroes as they chase him down with several false leads and misidentifications. After almost a century this tale still holds up well. The sinking of the Lusitania and other events of the Great War play a prominent role as Victorian life provides our setting.	2004-08-22

Take this one to the beach this summer and bring a scorecard to keep track of all the players. Of course, there are twins who suffer from mistaken identities, and a chance meeting of adversaries from a long ago time in a remote location.<br />Murder on the Links actually features two murders and two detectives. Poirot is summoned to France by a wealthy businessman apparently in need of security, who turns up dead only hours before Poirot's arrival. Then another body turns up near the same golf course, but perhaps the death is due to natural causes. Then a younger detective appears, convinced that Poirot is a dottering old fool, with obsolete methods lacking the modern scientific approach.<br />Of course, Captain Hastings (from the Affair at Styles) is back as the narrator. Unfortunately here, Hastings becomes captivated by a young nameless woman and blunders in ways injurious to the solving of the crime. Ultimately, Poirot resolves the thing and shows up the young pretender.	2004-06-27

Fortunately most of us have no idea of the terrible suffering and deaths from strangulation that await those, mostly children and natives, who contract such a disease. However, in 1925, diptheria was still known and epidemics were well known, the most recent one having been the post WWI Spanish Influenza, which had very high mortality rates in certain populations.<br />In 1925 Alaska, still a territory largely administered by Washington bureaucrats very unfamiliar with local issues, the argument had two vociferous sides. The traditionalists favored the use of the well-tested dog sled to transport fragile serum to Nome. Others led by businessmen and newspaperman, some with a commerical interest, demanded that an airplane serum drop be undertaken. In some ways this time was much like our own, with an unbelievable reliance on technology that has not really been proven under adverse conditions. <br />Ultimately the governor weighed the arguments and went with the well-proven dog sled, which was successful in delivering the serum, albeit after many deaths had occurred. The flying proponents lacked no courage or perseverence, but ulitmately were unsuccessful in a test flight. <br />Only 22 years after the Wright flyer lifted off at Kitty Hawk, airplane technology was not ready for the demands of this transport. The military had only very recently ever attempted any flying this far north, and it was only done under very controlled conditions and certainly not in the January blizzard that then prevailed. <br />The first part of the book is perhaps the most interesting part, where the Salisburys take us through a history of the development of Alaska and give us a sense of the remotenessand lack of access. Ports were frozen all winter. Roads, railroads, and telephone lines did not extend into the interior. Only the frontier spirit, willingness to come to another's aid, and survival skills acquired through generations of hard lessons allowed anyone to live in the territory.	2004-05-14

Here Krakauer interweaves a story of individual Mormom fundamentalists gone very bad with the less than 200 year history of the movement.<br />Krakauer gives us the full tale of the first prophet Joseph Smith, whose ultimate demise followed a reign of political intrigue, sexual scandals, charges of counterfeiting and occultism, aggressive tactics more typicallly associated with latter-day Philadelphia politicians, and various short-notice late-night movements around the country. Perhaps most famously Smith receives a directive from God that plural marriage is the path of the righteous, and a second directive to tell his first wife that she will be eternally damned if she does not cooperate.<br />After Smith goes on to his just rewards in a jail house shootout, Brigham Young (direct ancestor of the well-known Super Bowl quarterback Steve Young) leads the fledgeling organization into Utah. While all know that Utah is today the LDS headquarters, few remember that this was done to avoid the control of the US government, as Utah was Mexican territory when Young and his band appeared on the desert scene. <br />More bad relations with both Indians and Americans ensue, culminating in murders and atrocities committed on settlers crossing Utah on their way to the newly discovered California gold field settlements. Ultimately Federal troops appear and Washington legislators force the LDS to give up their polygamist ways in order to continue operations. <br />This restructuring of the church gives rise to the fundamentalist movement, which Krakauer traces in detail, as that small sect is ultimately responsible for a disproportionate amount of violence, right up to the present, including the disappearance of Elizabeth Smart. These fundamentalists, long outcast from main-stream Mormonism, embrace polygamy, literal reading of the scriptures, and prophecies of world destruction, leaving only the true believers intact. <br />This is a fascinating read, with the right mix of history and non-fictional accounts of the fundamentalist murder cases. One needs to learn this material to understand the history of our country.	2004-04-18

After a few years, he left the show to make movies, featuring characters he recycled from the show. <br />When this charade ground to a halt due to total indifference from the ticket-buying public, he carved out a new and unique niche for himself as the ultra-liberal alternative to the wildly successful conservative commentators. The key difference being that millions of people listen every day to Limbaugh, O'Reilley, and Hannity, while Franken gets gigs speaking to the Des Moines Rotary Club and the National Association of Slaughterhouse Executives. At least Franken gets the occasional 3am appearance on C-SPAN, and is doing better than America's other liberal know-it-alls, Michael Dukakis, Mario Cuomo and Al Gore, who haven't left home in years except to pick up supplies at Walmart and to run the Buick through the carwash.<br />Having failed at TV, movies, public appearances, and numerous other ventures over the last thirty years, Franken turned to books. He is a reasonably good writer and like his earlier political book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, this is a funny, well-researched, though generally disorganized book. It is well stocked with funny bits, weird adventures, and chapters guaranteed to insult everyone, such as Supply-Side Jesus and Operation Chickenhawk. Even as a conservative, I agree that certain conservatives, such as Phil Gramm, Spiro Agnew, Strom Thurmond, and Dan Quayle are begging to be satirized.<br />Unfortunately for Franken, he has elected to take on the herculean and unwinnable task of disproving the arguments of very popular conservatives. When he shows them to be wrong now and then, one can easily dismiss him by pointing out that he has now shown his adversary to be 99.9% correct. <br />I dont see how therepublic is endangered by O'Reilley claiming to be from a lower-middle class Long Island neighborhood, instead of an upper-middle class Long Island neighborhood, especially since I have never been to either. Like most women that I know, the fabulous looking Anne Coulter lies about her age. Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh clearly don't understand statistical analysis or mathematics, but I doubt other radio personalities do either. <br />In other cases, Franken takes on politicians with mixed results. He obsesses about Bush's claim that the tax cut will primarily aid the lower income bracket. This is either true or false, depending on your assumptions, point of view, and definitions. To be clearer, the President should have said that the majority of people getting tax cuts will have income below a certain level. Or he could have said that low-income folks will get a larger percentage reduction in federal income tax. Both of these are probably true (I dont really claim to be a tax expert), and clearer than what he did say, although maybe that is what he meant. Unlike FDR and JFK, the Bushes are not known for clarity and exactitude of speech. <br />Read the book to see what the other side is thinking and also, find a few holes in our guys' arguments. Franken is best in his comedic trips and encounters, such as the admissions trip to Bob Jones University, the backstage argument with O'Reilley about use of splotchy photos on the book jacket, and the chance encounter with a former first lady.	2004-01-27

Another Georgian not only makes the cut, he advances quickly to the major leagues, where he is universally hated by the players for his dirty style of play and the public for tales of his wife-beating, drinking, and low-living. Ultimately, he becomes the top player of his age and very wealthy through Georgian business ventures (think Cobb and Coca-Cola), but he always refuses to see the old town and gang.  <br />Ben and Foster meet Lottie Parker on that train. This enigmatic creature is both innocent and way too worldly for her teenage years, but never one to be forgotten. Lottie changes their lives for several generations. Foster and Lottie marry, and name their son Little Ben. Ben goes home, takes a job in the dry goods store, and becomes engaged to the proprietor's daughter. Foster, Lottie, and Ben have a subsequent encounter; when Foster and Lottie are working a travelling carnival baseball game of skill, they make Ben look like the town hero and get him very nearly killed.<br />Several years pass and then Ben comes to see a dying Foster, who makes him promise to take Lottie home. Both Ben and Little Ben take ill, and end up in the care of Ben's lonely widowed mother and Ben's fiancee. Lottie becomes the talk of the town, first rumours spread that she and Ben had an illicit relationship, then she wins over all with her charm and grace, then she falls in love with Ben's long-suffering father-in-law, finally she leaves town to return home, just as rumour surface that she is the famous carny girl of many years earlier.<br />I have not read any other Terry Kay novels, and I highly recommend this one. It has a few slow places, especially in the beginning, but it gracefully ties together America's past-times of baseball, commerce, and raising families in the hard-scrabble turn of the century days without much medicine, transportation, employment, or money, especially in the rural South.	2004-01-22

Answer:  A Coworker  (A Dilbert Treasury)	Books	4	0	3	N	N	Dilbert deja vu encore again part III	Scott Adams has been producing his hilarious Dilbert cartoons for 15 years now, long enough for many of us to go from cubicle dweller to VP. This is very funny stuff, centered around the themes of co-workers from hell, such as the Office Sociopath and Mr. Goodenrich, the company president, and dysfunctional departments such as Sales. Unfortunately, there is nothing new here, it is all recycled from previously books. For the most part it is also a random collection of strips, with story lines from the go-go days of the 90's now seeming hopelessly out of date. <br />Let me summarize here. Like all Dilbert cartoons, this is funny stuff. Adams was a phone company engineer and knows better than anyone the lunacy of the workplace and he very competently translates it onto the strips.  If you have never read Dilbert, do not start here. Go for the earlier books like Willy the Mailboy or Clues for the Clueless.	2004-01-18

Life was easy going and without worries, surrounded by an extended family, including great-grandparents, and a neighborhood of caring life-time friends.  Reminds me of my own youth in the 1960's in Pennsylvania, without world war and depression in the future, and with only a few technological differences. You wont find anything here about the great problems of American democracy in the first half of the twentieth century, nor any tales of international espionage or outer space adventures, but it is an enjoyable read. <br />The Spaulding boys experience all the familiar delicacies of summer such as eskimo pies, new tennis shoes, cutting grass, beating rugs, and of course, the making of grandpa's dandelion wine.  Along the way, they debate the great philosophical issues of whether old people were ever young, and if so, do they have first names. <br />They meet two extreme old-timers, who imbue them with tales of the Civil War, and world travel, before they go peacefully into that quiet night to collect their just rewards. And of course, progress comes to their town, when the last trolley is replaced by a bus, and new strains of grass are proposed that would eliminate lawn mowing and weeding. <br />The town is terrified briefly by a stalker, and perpetually by the unseen and unknowable dangers lurking in the ravine. The lowly junkman, long extinct from American life, is not only active, but a source of great knowledge, comfort, security, and counsel, in addition to second hand toys and household goods. Minor tragedies occur, such as when a dear friend's family leaves town, the demise of the happiness machine, the time machine, and the green machine, and the inevitable return to school and the coming of autumn.	2004-01-05

Lynds has crafted a suspenseful thriller with solid, though perhaps stereotypical characters, and a good story line, though the ending was not that strong. <br />Our band here consists of Smith, a soldier-doctor-medical researcher, his CIA agent almost-sister-in-law, his best friend from high school-millionaire computer geek, and an aging British secret agent, living alone in the California mountains with only a trained mountain cat for company and protection. This is the first in the Covert-One series, as the government decides to formalize this group after their stunning success here.    <br />The protangonist, Smith, finds himself AWOL, on the run from Arab killers, set up by another high school friend, grieving over the murder of a fiancee and several colleagues, and seemingly on his own to contain the world's worst outbreak of a deadly virus. Also, it seems that the evil plot has been hatched by a conspiracy of greedy businessmen, government and military officials, that goes all the way to the pinnacle of power. And that is only the first two chapters.<br />Forunately, Smith manages to suppress his grieving, outrun the bad guys long enough to assemble his team in a armor plated Winnebago, and escape down a California logging trail. Here the team splits up with the commando and the geek heading east, hacking every computer on the trail of the criminals, while Smith heads to Iraq on the trail of the virus, where he meets up with Russell, the sister of his late fiancee. <br />Ultimately, the team determines that a pharmaceutical firm has been spreading the virus for many years, simultaneously developing and stockpiling the vaccine, in order to prosper from the worldwide disaster they created. The science and technology descriptions are masterfully revealed, a true strength of both Ludlum and Lynds. Finally, this thing comes to a rather weak conclusion, with the perpetrators being revealed and caught in a formulaic fashion.	2003-12-31

This is the first of his books that I have read, and I do not see why Margolin does not get the recognition accorded to Grisham or Ludlum, as he is clearly in that league.<br />In Gone, But Not Forgotten, two related crime stories, separated by 10 years and 3000 miles are unwoven simultaneously. In the New York and Oregon cases, the perpetrator is clearly a cunning genius, killing and kidnapping wives of prominent locals, but is it the same perpetrator in both cases?  And if so, why was he able to move on to the second venue and repeat the crime spree? <br />Key characters are involved in both cases, but some have moved on and some are not able to let go. Why did the accused in the second case pick an unknown lawyer to represent him and who is that journalist that is bird-dogging the case? Even to the most casual observer, the ending to the first case would not be satisfactory to professional detectives and prosecutors, yet the case was definitively closed ten years ago. <br />In the end, it all comes clear and Margolin has added some unique legal twists. In what must be one of life's toughest choices, prosecutors and politicians are forced to decide quickly to what extent crimes can be forgiven in exchange for information that might help the living. We had a similiar case in Philadelphia fifteen years ago, where a DA was criticized for reducing charges against a child molester in exchange for information.	2003-12-29

Patton, Jr.'s diaries and letters were assembled into this book in 1947, two years after his death. His widow Beatrice Ayer Patton served as a capable editor. This edition has some new material and was reprinted in 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of V-E day.<br />Unfortunately with Patton's premature and unusual death in December 1945, (calm yourselves, conspiracy theorists) the post-war world lost its opportunity for the war's greatest memoir and its most unpredictable political leader. War As I Knew It is the next best thing, a full account of the leadership and strategic thinking of our greatest warrior.<br />Readers will travel with Patton from his arrival in North Africa in 1943, through the campaigns in Sicily, Western France, Belgium, the Bulge, and ending in May 1945 in Austria. Lesser known events are related such as the initial fighting with the French in Africa. In many cases, Patton revisits towns and territory that he had first seen as a young officer in the First World War.<br />Surprisingly, the book is also full of humorous stories such as unusual encounters with African tribal leaders, British generals, and French politicians. Cameo appearances include Marlene Dietrich, General T. Roosevelt (son of the President, who participated in the Normandy Invasion), and historical figures like William the Conquerer who influenced Patton's tactics.<br />Patton greatly plays down the events that led to his downfall, only briefly mentioning the slapping incidents, although he does make a very forceful argument that malingerers are a great threat to morale and need to be punished with extreme measures. The press conferences in London and Boston that led to his dismissal from the Third Army are basically outside the scope of this book, as they occurred after V-E Day and receive only a footnote.<br />On another level the book is chocked full of real insights into leadership that are probably more relevant today than in the 1940's. Patton is a clear proponent of focused planning, communication, speedy execution and offensive action.<br />Here are some examples:<br />It is vital to good morale that decorations get out promptly and on an equitable basis.<br />Staff officers of inharmonious disposition, irrespective of their ability, must be removed.<br />Time (speed) is more valuable than co-ordination.<br />In war,the only sure defense is offense, and the efficiency of offense depends on the warlike souls of those conducting it. Successful generals make plans to fit circumstance, but do not try to create cirmcumstances to fit plans.<br />Whenever a man gets a medal, he usually attempts to outdo himself and gets killed, whereas in order to produce a virial race, such men should be kept alive.<br />I believe in fighting until lack of supplies forces you to stop, and then dig in.tton is a clear proponent of focused planning, communication, speedy execution and offensive action. <br />Here are some examples: <br />It is vital to good morale that decorations get out promptly and on an equitable basis. <BR>Staff officers of inharmonious disposition, irrespective of their ability, must be removed. <BR>Time (speed) is more valuable than co-ordination. <BR>In war,the only sure defense is offense, and the efficiency of offense depends on the warlike souls of those conducting it.

But without players like Unitas, Namath, Marino, Harris, Kelly, Montana, Moore, Ham, Cappalletti, etc. I dont know why they bother. <br />In any case, Grisham crafts a well written story about a dying coach who is a mix of Paul Bryant's committment, extreme training, sense of fairness (especially related to the integration process), and Woody Hayes' volatility and self-destructive behavior.  Coach Rake has won 13 state titles in 30+ years at Messina High and was ultimately fired over the heat exhaustion death of a player, in a Sunday morning torture session reminiscent of Bryant's Junction Boys.<br />As word circulates that the Coach is facing a fourth and long with no time outs remaining, the former players return to Rake Field for a vigil. Their ages range from 30 to 60, but most have never achieved any greatness since their high school football careers ended at 18. <br />Neeley is the protanganist here, an all-American quarterback who has not been back to Messina since his career ended with a cheap shot to his knee in a college game.  He starts to deal with issues such as why he dumped the true love of his life for a groupie with incredible legs and an inviting back-seat, and how he really feels about the coach who took him to the state championship, where an unfortunate confrontation occurred, that is only now being discussed.<br />Grisham tells a story well here, with clever foreshadowing and fascinating characters. Fortunately, no lawyers appear until a minor character pops up to give a eulogy at the funeral. The interaction of the players from several generations allows the story of the school's integration to be told, clearly Rake's actions then were his finest hour, along with his counseling of former players gone off the track or out of the closet.	2003-12-05

I was expecting a crazed left-wing Michael Moore type strident screed from this former Rolling Stone and Mother Jones writer, but it is not here, except for a few borderline-warranted postshots at the Republicans in Congress. <br />Schlosser starts out by detailing the rise of the early fast-food chains, most of which got their start in the pre-war and post-war salad days of Southern California, as federal subsidies and military bases and plants turned a desert into endless suburbia. The McDonald brothers and Ray Kroc quickly saw the economic advantages of eliminating waitresses, bus-boys, dishwashers, and skilled short-order cooks from the earlier drive-in or sit-down restaurant models. <br />America's diet changed over the next generation, as beef and then chicken became staples at the expense of pork. Chicken went from something you carved at home on the occasional Sunday afternoon to something dipped in honey mustard sauce behind the wheel of a Pontiac. The frozen French (now freedom) fry was developed by an obscure Idaho entrepreneur (now nonagenarian  billionaire), eliminating the early morning restaurant chore of peeling hundreds of potatoes.<br />The slaughterhouse went from a solid big-city middle-class employer of highly skilled meat packers to a High Plains battleground of unskilled non-English speaking immigrants, often spilling as much of their own blood as that of their prey. Grocery store and restaurant butchers disappeared as centralized meat processors cut and wrapped the product.  <br />Cattle went from being grass-fed to being fed grain in feedlots.  Make sure you get the 2002 edition as Schlosser has added a section on the latest issues with mad cow disease.  Some of the worst practices with adding animal remains to feed have been curtailed, but research and experience is now showing mad cow disease to transmit across species, making any addition of mammal remains to feed potentially dangerous. <br />The other interesting issue is the potential for horrible disease from the presence of the mutant e coli bacteria, as occurred in the Jack-in-the-Box chain in the 1990's. The toxins produced by these bacteria can destroy organs and cause death within a week. I hate to admit it, but here more governament regulation is required, as Schlosser points out. The USDA has no real authority to recall contaminated meat. The supplier must agree to voluntarily launch a recall, and the quantity and terms of the recall are set by the supplier. He may choose to keep it a secret from state officials for example, that meat is being removed from local restaurants, with some of it already having been consumed. Clearly, it is in the interest of the supplier to delay any recall, as this reduces the un-consumed amount.	2003-11-28

It only covers the first half or so of his incredible life, so the things that really made him well-known are not covered, but there is plenty here anyway. <br />Franklin recounts his family's modest life in England and the circumstances that brought them to Boston. He was among the youngest of a very large family, ultimately finding his way to Philadelphia to find work as a printer when an apprenticeship with an older brother turned sour. <br />We always think of Franklin as being a slightly older statesman among the Founding Fathers, when in fact he was a full generation older than Washington or Jefferson. Unlike popular perception, he was an athletic and vibrant youth, who rescued a drowning Dutch companion and taught swimming to children of London's elite.  <br />Philadelphia in the 1720's and 1730's was a small town, never sure if it would really take off as a settlement. Franklin quickly befriended key politicians who felt Philadelphia had grown sufficiently to have a world-class print shop. He played a key role in the town's development, leading civic groups in establishing libraries, fire companies, meeting halls, and street cleaning services.  Of course, he was also the consummate politician, serving in office, and networking his way to his first fortune by publishing government documents and printing the first paper currency. He also had a knack for working with the several important religious sects of that time and place, especially the pacifist Quakers, even though Franklin was a deist.<br />Franklin was a clever businessman.  In today's lexicon, he effectively franchised across the colonies his concept of the publisher/printer who would provide both the content and the ink on paper.  By age 30, he had set up his business affairs so that his printing businesses in several colonies were operated by partners and he received a share of the profits, allowing him to pursue other interests.  <br />The autobiography is unfinished, so we don't hear his account of his pursuits of electricity, which made him as famous and well-known as Bill Gates is today, nor his thought on the Revolution. Franklin did play a key role in establishing logistical support to the British during their fight with the French in the New World. At that time and during his years in Europe, he was generally perceived as a Tory supporter. <br />Read this book to learn how Franklin devoted himself to self-improvement by establishing clubs, lending libraries, a sober lifestyle allowing time for study, and his methods for measuring his personal performance against metrics he had established for a proper lifestyle. One will also gather a new appreciation for the fullness, utility, and richness of the English language when put on paper by a master.	2003-11-16

The first two hundred pages are truly riveting as Bourne is brought back into action by the kidnapping of his wife.  Bourne is reunited with Conklin, who had tried to kill him in the first book, and heads to Hong Kong, where his wife is being held and several political murders have occurred. The killer is an imposter of Jason Bourne who leaves notes and clues implicating the real Jason Bourne. <br />In the second part of the book, things get so complicated that one needs to get out a scorecard. The action is non-stop, with each chapter ending on a note of true suspense. Some of the sub-plots appear to go nowhere, and when you get to the last chapter, you discover that they really dont go anywhere, other than to add some color to the transformation of Webb back into the Medusan Bourne. A minor character from the first book reappears and becomes Jason Bourne's true compatriot and ally. <br />Ultimately, it becomes clear that the kidnapping was a contrived plot to get Bourne to take on a series of assignments he would have refused. Unfortunately, the Jackal never really shows himself in China and we all must wait another ten years for Ludlum's third installment, where the Jackal returns for his final showndown with Bourne. The political intrigue surrounding the anti-Bourne murders are very good, unusual for Ludlum, and a rich 20th century Chinese history lesson. Old rivalries between the KMT and the Communists, including a Chinese version of the Manchurian candidate, nearly lead to a world war over the future of the Hong Kong colony.	2003-11-03
US	51792543	R1DU43GONT4SAR	0786888741	913320116	Lucky Man: A Memoir	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Lucky Fox	It is hard to remember or belive now, but in the 1980's, Michael J. Fox was a huge celebrity with a top-ranked TV show and several blockbuster movies. This is his story of a life transformation brought about by a debilitating condition, young onset Parkinson's disease. <br />Michael divides the first 40 years of his life into four chapters.  In the first, and to me least interesting, he is a typical lower-middle class Canadian Army brat, who has minor success in local TV and theatre productions, while struggling with schoolwork (he never finishes high school) and normal adolescent social and relationship problems. <br />Things pick up a little in the second chapter, where he decides that his minor success in Canada is the stepping stone to a Hollywood career. Michael nearly starves for three years in a run-down LA apartment, waiting for agents and producers to call, until the phone and the power are turned off for non-payment.<br />By a near miracle, Michael lands the job on Family Ties and begins the third chapter, noted by excessive drinking, hard work, major career success, a string of going-nowhere relationships, and rampant spending on homes and cars.  Halfway through this chapter, Michael is diagnosed with PD, but decides to keep it a secret for nearly a decade. Michael pops pills at just the right time to keep his symptoms hidden, while sneaking off to weekend medical consultations and procedures in hidden locations. He learns to sit on his hands to hide the shaking if the meds are not timed just right. <br />Finally, the fourth chapter begins. Michael has a family, a loving and beautiful wife, and a committment, ultimately fulfilled, to quit drinking, reel in his other excesses, and confront his PD. Michael's doctors had earlier told him that his PD would limit his career to about 10 years.  <br />Particularly interesting are the decisions he makes about how to best use these ten last productive years. Michael attempts to break out of the hopeless typecasting that he has been pigeon-holed into by appearing in Woody Allen films and other roles.  Finally accepting that due to his height and looks, he has no chance to age gracefully like fellow sit-com stars Woody Harrelson or Tom Hanks into leading man roles, Fox pursues directing and accepts that he does not need to take every role to continue earning as he did in the 1980's. A string of box-office failures brings this point home in the 1990's. <br />Michael Fox has put together a fascinating autobiography, that everyone should read to get some perspective back in their life. It is not particularly well written, as Fox likes to jump around almost randomly, nearly skipping major sections such as the Back to the Future sequels, and dwell endlessly on minor characters and incidents from his youth.  It is a honest reflection on how life and one's expectations and objectives change from youth to mid-adulthood.	2003-09-28

You need to get this edition as he has thoroughly updated his material to explain rules, procedures, and protocols for job-hunting on the Internet. <br />I was an unemployed executive for nearly a year before landing my current position and Lucht's book is the roadmap for any similar journey. He has insightful sections on resumes, cover letters, severance negotiations, outplacement, networking, references, as well as the better known how-to-guide for dealing with all stripes of recruiters.  <br />Don't get hung-up on the title. While Lucht is most familiar with recruiting at the C-level, most of this applies equally well for managers, directors, and experienced professionals. The only criticism I have is that Lucht is focused on job-hunting in strong markets, and needs more analysis of today's humbling markets. He is fairly critical of the typical outplacement service that considers it a success when they place laid-off software executives as owner-operators of ice cream parlors and coffee shops and franchisees of muffler and transmission repair stores. <br />Lucht also thoughtfully debunks a lot of media myths about finding work without a resume or a network. His promotion of direct mail as a marketing tool sounds old-fashioned but it works if you understand that less than 1% of your mail will yield leads, but these are likely leads that would not have been otherwise obtained. Lucht also has built a useful website and avoids the high fees and endless cross-promotions that his competitors favor.	2003-09-01

Only one survives to fight another day. Bourne returns to active duty because his family is under attack. The influence of the Jackal extends to all intelligence services and governments.  Following the formula, Bourne miraculously survives several close adventures with the Jackal, where he is clearly over-matched.  <br />Bourne and his rag-tag band of rejects, retirees, in-laws, and psychiatrists make many blunders before getting a line on the Jackal. Clearly, the thirteen years since the first Bourne adventure in Paris with the Jackal were not spent exclusively in commando and physical training. Also, this informal group seems to have trouble deciding who is in charge and how to proceed. Unbelievably the final showdown occurs in Moscow, which is clearly advantageous to the Jackal as he trained there many years ago. <br />There is a side story going on as well, with a group of former army junior officers from Vietnam, now prominent in the US government, military, and business, forming a murky Carlyle Group type organization to buy companies and assets. They have made millions in the process and will stop at nothing to continue. Bourne's group stumbles onto this new Medusa network and uses it to force Carlos above ground.<br />In reality, Carlos is still living in a Parisian prison, serving life sentences for 1970's era terrorist killings. He has enlisted the aid of the leftist President of his native Venezuela to promote his parole. Robert Ludlum is dead, but here things turn out differently.	2003-09-01

Jack is a recently fired software executive whose overambitious wife ends up running a division of a nanotechnology firm where things are clearly not quite right. <br />Ultimately, Jack is hired by his wife's firm, to resolve some minor coding issues, as his previous firm sold the code to his wife's firm. Actually, the problem is that rapidly evolving and learning swarms have been haphazardly released into the isolated environment of a Nevada test facility. The original concept was that the swarm would provide military surveillance capability without any possibility of detection or destruction.  A related medical application was developed, whereby the swarm would invade one's body instead of x-rays and MRI's. <br />Jack's wife's firm clearly has no idea how to solve the problem and in fact, makes the situation much worse. <br />Now to my criticisms. First, the book is written in first person and the dialogue is rather tedious, with the children's petty arguments and stupid remarks for some reason playing an important role.  Secondly, the latter half of the book, with Jack on location in Nevada leading the charge against the swarm, is almost a slap-stick escapade. Things really get nuts when the swarm learns to mimic humans and even infects them without Jack's knowledge. The science and technology and warnings on the use are excellent and timely, but the action sequences could be from an Abbott and Costello movie. <br />Take this book to the beach.  Light reading with a heavy message and some wacky adventures.	2003-07-31

Rockefeller in an earlier venture known as Standard Oil who decided in his 70's to pursue a second career in railroading, land development, and luxury hotels in the then desolate country of South Florida and the Keys. <br />Standiford weaves together Flagler, Rockefeller, their arch-rival trust-busting Teddy Roosevelt, WWI bonus armies, and big-game hunting author Ernest Hemingway. While Rockefeller also owned vacation homes in Florida, he and Flagler ultimately had a parting of the ways, with Rockefeller pointedly not attending Flagler's funeral. Flagler had been an early supporter of Roosevelt in his successful bid for the New York governorship after Roosevelt's success in the brief Spanish American war. Later Roosevelt brought antitrust action against Standard Oil and at least in Flagler's mind was behind government resistance to his plan to build a deep water harbor in Miami. Ironically, the US victory in the Spanish American War, together with confirmed plans to build the Panama Canal, were the motiviation for Flagler's railroad adventures, as Flagler projected, incorrectly as it turned out, that Miami and Key West would grow in stature as ports. <br />The final thread introduces Hemingway into the mix. The author was already a well-known Key Wester when the hurricane of Labor Day 1935 ravaged the Keys. Although Hemingway's home and his beloved boat Pilar were not seriously damaged, Flagler's railroad was destroyed.  A group of WWI bonus army veterans were working on road construction. Many were killed, despite a daring railroad rescue attempt. By 1935, Flager was long dead and the railroad was in bankruptcy. It was never rebuilt, although some bridges are still standing, for the exclusive use of fishermen and birds.	2003-07-28

Poirot and a group of fellow Belgians have resettled in an English village, after displacement from their homeland. Poirot has already retired from Belgian police work, speaking fondly of turn-of-the-century cases with friendly Scotland Yard detectives. <br />This is a standard issue murder case with the ancient mansion dweller as the victim.  She is recently remarried and has also recently broken with a long-time friend and companion. Filling out the list of suspects are two step-sons who would benefit financially from her demise and several house guests, including a young pharmacist and a German spy. Poirot is called in the day of the murder and follows his standard practice. He sends cryptic messages to suspects to gauge their response, tracks suspects across the county, and even does primitive forensic studies. The book is written by a resident wounded veteran who was a long-time friend of both Poirot and the family at Styles.<br />There are two features here to recommend this book. The first is the mystery within the mystery structure in which the obvious suspect ultimately turns out to be the guilty one, albeit with an unexpected accomplice. The second is the deliberately researched poisoning mechanism employed. Dame Christie received a positive review in the 1920's from a leading British pharmacology journal for her efforts. For those who enjoy the complex, this book is wracked with it. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters and their myriad interactions with Poirot and each other. Reading it the second time brought out a lot of foreshadowing and important facts, dropped into the text as minor details.	2003-07-28

The book was written in 1990 and provided the final chapter on the LBO excesses of the 1980's. By 1990, the stock market rally had made LBO's less attractive and some of the earlier deals were already starting to unravel and collapse under the weight of the debt payments, as predicted by long-time junk bond critic and rival RJR Nabisco bidder Ted Forstmann.<br />There are some criticisms of this book. The authors, despite their finanical backgrounds, seem to prefer story-telling to financial details. Hence, they have written a tale of personalities, with an especial interest in Ross Johnson and Henry Kravis, to the detriment of really explaining the financial and business details. The reader can learn intricate details about Johnson and the Wall Streeters preferences in cars, apartments, drinks, wives, schoos, etc.  The authors seem to think we need a biographic account of all minor players, starting with their grade-school years, and the end result is 528 pages and still minimal financial explanation.<br />The other main criticism here, reading this now, is how dated the material has become.  The authors would do well to provide some new material on how the deal has worked out.  From other sources, I learned that KKR renegotiated the deal in the early 1990's (the resets were nearly toxic after all) and sold out their position entirely in 1995, more or less breaking even, depending on whose numbers you use.<br />The story of the final bids and the final final bids is truly riveting and meticulously researched here. The Johnson group ultimately presents a bid that is slightly higher than the KKR bid, but the board discounts the Johnson bid since it does not guarantee the bond pricing, and calls the whole thing a tie, much like the 2000 election. At that point, the Board accepts the KKR bid, for non-economic reasons, mostly bad publicity related to Johnson's greed. Ironically, Johnson had already given up much of his payout in order to boost the total value of the bid to the shareholders.ccepts the KKR bid, for non-economic reasons, mostly bad publicity related to Johnson's greed.

Marius is the First Man in Rome, even the Third Founder of Rome, for his military victories. Yet he is also a shrewd political operator, divorcing his wife of 25 years, to establish an alliance with a more established family, in order to enable his promotion within the Senate. <br />Marius suffers from a lack of gravitas, in that he is only a rich Italian, and not a member of Rome's establishment until his marriage to a daughter of the house of Julius. Marius also suffers from well-connected enemies who despise him and his camp for a series of childhood pranks performed some 30 years earlier. <br />His ally, Sulla, is the opposite, a member of a well-established family, but a man of low-living and poverty, until he engineers several secretive deaths to create an inheritance and he too marries a daughter of the house of Julius, becoming Marius's brother in law and chief aide-de-camp. Together they defeat other Roman politicians as well as the greatest nomadic army ever seen by Rome. Those who foretold the future turn out to be correct as Marius is returned to the highest office in the Senate an unprecedented five times. <br />This book is well-written but difficult to follow at times due to the incredible numbers of characters, some of whom are of no real relevance. It is necessary to keep the glossary handy and take notes as well. The glossary by itself would be as much as other novelists provide for the same price.  It contains endless descriptions of Roman customs, practices, and history.	2003-07-16

In the 1980's, Michael Lewis was a neophyte bond salesman for Salomon Brothers in New York and London for four years. Liar's Poker is a high-stakes game the traders, salesmen, and executives play each afternoon, but it is also a metaphor for the Salomon culture of extreme risk-taking with immediate payoffs and clear winners and losers. <br />This is the story of how Lewis survived the training program, inept but mean-spirited management, an aborted take-over even featuring a white knight, layoffs and the 1987 market crash before quitting to find his real calling as a business journalist. While Lewis's career did not take off quickly, he eventually became a highly paid producer, although not in the league of the true top dogs. <br />Lewis tells the real story of Wall Street in both go-go and crash days with self-deprecating humor enlivened with his ecletic wit. Colorful and well-known Wall Street characters appear such as Michael Milken, Lazlo Birini, Warren Buffett, Bill Simon, Sr. and John Guetfruend.  All business students need to read this as even those with advanced degrees in finance such as myself, will learn how things really work. The story of how the junk bond and collateralized mortgage backed security markets emerge is told to fill in a chapter in financial history. Perhaps most interesting is some of the political machinations, rampant at Salomon, which lead for example for Salomon to ignore the junk bond market, allowing others to flourish and eventually attempt to take-over Salomon using junk bonds.  <br />Lewis also describes for all investors the conflicts of interest and lack of governance on Wall Street long before Eliot Spitzer and Arthur Levitt became the champions of the little guy. My next step is to read Lewis's later books.	2003-07-15

Al Franken is a long-time star of big and small screen, who has chosen to focus on writing books instead of Saturday Night Live skits in the last few years. This is one of his weaker efforts. Clearly the \\"Al Franken Decade\\" has long since passed into history.<br />Franken had the clever idea to write a parody of advice books, but unfortunately, the cleverness wears off after about 20 pages, in other words, there is enough here for a Bill Murray skit but not a full-length film. Franken is funny, and puts some clever comedic moments into this, but I got the idea that he was writing it as fast as I was reading it.<br />What works well here is his chapter summaries. Early on in the book, he provides Maria Shriver/Oprah Winfrey type summaries with action items, journals, and topics for monthly discussion with one's mentor. As the book progresses, the summaries degenerate into excuses for why the chapter was not very good, new information that Franken forgot to put in the chapter, and material totally unrelated to the chapter.  Franken is a natural comic genius, and adds some other nice touches, such as references to non-existent chapters (he later explains that the editor deleted his books 4-7 from the manuscript, leaving us with only books 1-3), his cut-outs of handy information such as the country codes for dialing every nation, and his reasons for ranking religions into a Top Ten list.<br />But in the end, this is a jumble of un-related rants and random thoughts. There is no story to this and it does not hold one's interest, even for a fan like me. One is almost concerned for the well-being of the Franken family, if this is what the mighty have fallen to.	2003-07-09

Abagnale was an audacious New York teenager, who netted several million dollars and prison terms in several countries, from his unbelievable fraudulent lifestyle in the 1960's. Abagnale impersonated a lawyer, doctor, pilot, and a college professor, while traveling the world writing bad checks. This book was first published in the 1980's after Johnny Carson told Frank that he should write a book. The story became a movie last year and the book has been re-released. <br />I recommend this book highly. True it is a bit dated and not particularly well written, but the stories will mesmerize you. I read it almost without stopping. There is a lot more and less to this story than the movie shows. The time in the French prison under inhumane conditions is a riveting read which never made it to the movie. After being captured in France, Abagnale was imprisoned in Perpignan for six months, without the benefit of a bed, clothing, or a toilet. Upon his release, he was extradited to Sweden, found guilty there and spent another six months in prison, albeit more like a country club. Then a Swedish judge finds a loophole in the law to allow Abagnale to return to face charges in the US, rather than spending the next 20 years in a succession of European courts and prisons. Criminals should learn to hideout in countries where they have committed no crimes, especially ones without extradition treaties with the US. <br />The movie also took a lot of liberty with other events, mostly to build up the Tom Hanks character, but none of that really mattered. The real issue with the movie (and to a lesser extent, the book) was that it does not bring out Abagnale's motivation. Abagnale claims that he was suffering from raging hormones and pursued his travels and theft to meet exotic women. This is clearly one reason, but it is also clear that he enjoys the risk and the danger. At times, some of the risk-taking seems crazy, like attending a party in the same neighborhood of a previous victime and impersonating an FBI agent to take possession of a bad check. One almost thinks he wanted to get caught.<br />Abagnale spends just the right amount of ink on his exploits. One doesnot need to know every nuance of banking in the 1960's, but the explanation of the unique \\"routing number\\" scam he developed is interesting.	2003-07-08

Christopher Buckley seems to get no press or respect, but he has snuck up on us, nearly unannounced as the best satirist of this generation. Take this one to the beach and laugh out loud.  <br />A sitting President wakes up dead one spring morning after a late night romp with an actress turned Middle East peace advocate, and a resulting bump on the head by a suspicious and very upset wife. Although the evidence seems weak initially, the Attorney General elects to prosecute the First Lady for murder. She brings in a $1000 per hour litigator, who also happens to be an ex-boyfriend from law school. Turns out the First Lady dumped the attorney for a war hero law student, who later becomes the philandering Commander in Chief. Clearly, this is not based on the Clintons as Clinton was never a war hero, more like the opposite, and it is hard to imagine Hillary having multiple male suiters. Then things get really crazy, with renewed romances and unexpected consequences, charges of jury tampering, false evidence, and defendants determined to not only testify when it seems un-neccesary and risky, but to represent themselves.  When you think you have it figured out, here come the international financiers immersed in deals with the Chinese, civil war between the FBI and the CIA, and shadowy fugitive ex-agents with stories of espionage to tell that make Watergate look truly irrelevant.	2003-06-27

The King of Torts is one of the better Grisham books, a classic tale of a young lawyer torn between money, love, and ethics, with a rich supporting cast. One of the characters, Patton French, was pre-viewed in The Summons, but he was great there and even better here. <br />Clay Carter is a poorly paid, unappreciated OPD attorney with a fugitive-lawyer father turned fishing captain-drunk and a fiancee with meddling parents that he can't stand. One day, a fireman appears and offers him a chance to convert stolen documents and insider information into a small fortune.  Clay accepts this assignment, and then builds a mass tort empire and a fortune, based on other assignments brought to him by this very shadowy character. <br />Ultimately, Clay both wins and loses some big cases, involving hundreds of millions in class action settlements. Like a dot-commer, Clay does not know when to take his chips off the table, and keeps on betting all or nothing. In this high stakes game, a lawsuit to which Clay is not a party, decided while he is in the hospital, ultimately is the event which determines who will win and who will be bankrupt.  He also realizes very late in the game, that he is only a pawn in a larger game being played by some of the pharmaceutical companies that he has been suing.<br />Clay has also chosen to move on from his long-time girlfriend, trading her in for a Georgian model.  This does not seem to be a decision Clay or Rebecca can live with, even though the long-time girlfriend suddenly marries another. Clay and the model make a cameo appearance at the wedding, and we know that this marriage will not be long-standing.	2003-06-17

While there is not a lot of new information here, Olson puts the sordid tale in perspective and adds much useful analysis and commentary. <br />Especially useful is her take on the 24th hour Clinton pardons, which the main-stream media chose to cover lightly, if at all. There is clear evidence here of an influence peddling scandal with these 2001 pardons, with the most flagrant case involving fugitive Marc Rich. After reading this, one must ask how did the Clintons win all those elections, especially the New York Senate race, after Mrs. Clinton was clearly exposed by eight years of negative reports.  My only concern now is that it might be possible for one of the Clintons to win another national election. Like Rocky or Freddy Krueger, we may find them back again, if not enough Americans read this book.<br />The sections on Mrs. Clinton's ethical lapses are outstanding as well. Again, I think that the main-stream press did not adequately cover that Mrs. Clinton violated Senate rules in taking a large advance on a book deal. Technically the rules do not apply to a senator-elect and apparently no rules apply to the sitting First Lady. Remember that Newt Gingrich was nearly run out of town for taking a much smaller book advance.	2003-06-04

He truly delights in each Rodent mis-step, especially when financial loss, great public relations embarassment, and dead animals are involved. <br />While this book can be read in a few hours, as it appears to be nothing more than recycled newspaper columns with some extra meat tossed in, there is something entertaining here. I am not familiar with Hiassen's other writing, but here he is genuinely amusing and original, especially when Disney Chairman Michael Eisner becomes his target.  Hiassen has thought through in detail how Disney succeeds, especially in ensuring good press coverage by sponsoring junkets for small town newspaper writers. Hiassen attends one and attempts to pay retail for all services and fails despite his most earnest efforts.  I would have liked to see more information on the methods Walt Disney employed to surreptiously purchase land and create an autonomous political entity, but that is short-changed here, other than to show that the resulting security force is out of control.  The book was published in 1998 and now appears slightly dated, as the lustre appears to be off the Disney marketing juggernaut in the last few years. In an update, Hiassen could add mis-steps with Disney Stores and films to his gleeful telling of failures in residential real estate and Virginia civil war parks.	2003-05-28

Here a law professor and his brother are summoned home by their dying father. One brother finds the father dead and also discovers $3 MM in cash. Almost idiotically, he assumes that the old man, a country judge, had come by this loot through gambling once a week at a local casino and spends more than half the book researching that absurd thesis. <br />Finally, the professor drops that line of inquiry and meets up with the most interesting character in the book, who immediately and proudly admits he was the source of the funds. Too bad, he did not show up in the first 50 pages and save us endless trips to Atlantic City and river-boat casinos. However, the mystery is only half-solved since the source of the funds is not the one trying to kill the professor.   <br />Grisham also introduces a lot of other one-dimensional and irrelevant characters such as a student romantic interest, a hard-boiled private investigator, and some washed out pilots who hold court at the local airstrip.  A divorce lawyer named Harry Rex provides a lot of comic relief and quips, but does little to assist his friend the professor, although the professor seems to consider Harry Rex a suspect at times.  I think that some of these characters were left over from other books. <br />Finally, everything is revealed in the last 20 pages as numerous mis-understandings and rivalries between the brothers flow forth.  <br />This is one of Grisham's weaker efforts, but still better than most authors could put together. He seems to be trying to maximize his literary output and earnings while working gentleman's hours.  It is a nice light read, ideal for beach or audiocassettes, and it will be easily adaptable to the big screen.	2003-05-10

This is a good book, if you are looking for a guide to investments and markets. It is written for the novice investor, so more experienced investors will probably skip some sections, such as the last chapter on 401k's. However, there are real insights here for everyone. I have a master's degree in finance and I picked up a few things as well. Levitt also tells his autobiographical story in some detail, with especially interesting sections on his long relationship with his former partner and boss, Sandy Weill, now Chairman of Citicorp. Levitt likes to exaggerate his common-man rags-to-riches lifestory, only occasionally mentioning that his father was NY State Controller for 30 years, while prefering stories of his school-teacher mother and immigrant grandparents. Levitt is also cagey about how he became SEC chairman, only mentioning that he played a minor role in raising money for Clinton in 1992.	2003-05-03

Smith teams up with his long-time CIA and MI6 colleagues and a childhood friend / electronics genius. The team moves quickly and easily from US to Europe and Northern Africa in search of terrorists who are only a front for other terrorists who are only a front for the real evil-doers. This thing has plot twists within other enigmatic plot twists. For several chapters, we dont even know which of the protangonists are dead or alive.  On the downside, the Covert-One team and their camp-followers have nearly unbelievable extra-ordinary moments, seemingly ripped from the Superman cartoons. Why can't three poorly armed agents battle an army of trained terrorists if they have a French actress also on their side?  Why can't John Smith stowaway on a terrorist boat for several days with no weapons, occasionally killing a few meddlesome terrorists without being noticed? This is a good read for the beach. Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously.

He wrote this book in 1948 without ghost-writers, and his wit and wisdom are stunning. Everyone needs to read this to understand the issues that face us in Iraq and elsewhere today. The general explains how the real work of the military is developing strategy, drawing up plans, building relationships with governments and civilians, and quickly implementing and changing the plans as required. Only criticism is his tencency to dismiss the inappropriate behavior of Patton, but keep in mind that Patton was already dead when this book was written and Eisenhower would not criticize those who were not positioned to defend themselves. He is critical of others, especially Montgomery for his foolish proposal of launching a blitz on Berlin to bring the war to an early end. Another lesson for our time is the treachery of the French troops both in Vichy and Algeria, who fight the Allied invasion and put personal objectives above military and political goals. Unbelievable candor throughout such as when Eisenhower reports that an obviously overwhelmed Truman offers to help Eisenhower in any way that he can, including supporting him for the Presidency in 1948. Important career lesson: Eisenhower did not receive any significant promotions in the 20 years after WWI and was doing staff work under McArthur for 5 years, building up the Filipino military, yet became the highest rank allied commander, through hard work, dedication, and leadership.	2003-03-23

Terrific action and characters; my only complaint would be that the book is actually overly complex and un-neccesarily so. The movie producers tried to remedy that by removing most of the best characters, such as the doctor in France and the retired general and his traitorous wife. They even took out Carlos and his henchmen and the Treadstone team. The left-over characters would be sufficient for a half dozen sequels and a weekly TV show!<br />Some would question whether one man could be shot this many times and continue operations but I dont like to worry about anatomical details. Ludlum is clearly a master of this genre, superheroes fighting many shadowy enemies in non-stop action, supported by one-dimensional female love interests, apparently based on 1940's movie stars. Dont look for any political intrigue or thrilling technical information. Ludlum tries to conjure up some international political and financial storylines and then seems to lose interest in them without completion. <br />Ludlum's true genius shows in the way he reveals the story to us.  Bourne has lost most of his memory in one of the many times that he is shot. The reader also steps into the story cold and learns page by page, who is Bourne and how did he get here. The movie does not handle this well, as it is too quick to get to the love interest and the battle with Bourne's former managers.	2003-02-04

The name calling and snippy comments are annoying, but easy to skip over, and some are quite amusing, such as the well-publicized \\"Eva Braun of morning TV\\". I can understand that she needs to be outspoken, to stand out from the other conservative books. This book does compare reasonably well with most of the conservative books that I have read, but will never match Rush or Buckley in style or passion. Coulter's analysis of the 2000 presidential elections, especially with the times for calling the various races, is well done and worth the price of the book by itself. The sections on the success of conservative books and talk shows also provides information that I have not seen elsewhere. She is obviously bright, and the book is well-researched, but it does not really tell a story well. Her style is a recitation of very interesting facts, and then BOOM the book is over. I would like to see Coulter take on Al Franken in a televised debate. How would ... react to a micro-skirt?
