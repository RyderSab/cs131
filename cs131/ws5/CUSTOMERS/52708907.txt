Barbarossa was the biggest invasion in history.For a long time, it has continued to fascinate historians and layman alike. With the passage of time was shrouded in a welter of falsehoods and half-truths.The author has disentangled facts from myth. He has shown why Wehrmacht despite inflicting staggering losses failed to decisively defeat the Soviet Union.<br /><br />It must be remembered when Hitler invaded Russia Stavka[ General Staff] had not fully recovered from the damage inflicted upon it by Stalinist purge.Besides Red Army was in the midst of a re-organisation designed to reform its force  structure,leadership,training ,equipment,tactics.Many foreign observers thought the country was saddled by a hollow,defunct military establishment and defeat appeared imminent.Against such overwhelming odds Russia survived and ultimately triumphed.Since then many academics have argued Rasputitsa[Oct rains which turn Russian countryside into a sea of mud]harsh winter combined to thwart Wehrmacht when it stood at gates to Moscow.This book,however questions this view.<br /><br />Wehrmacht's unprepardeness to fight in Russian winter certainly contributed to German defeat.Primary reason leading to German failure lay in the fact Wehrmacht miscalculated Red Army's strength precisely reserves which it could bring from the depths of the country.This helped Stavka to raise fresh divisions from scratch,enabling the erection,of several lines of resistance astride invader's path,as Red Army quickly replenished its losses.New divisions launched incessant counter-attacks;for the Germans struggle started with Battle of Smolensk.Though these attacks were smashed it imposed tremendous attrition upon Wehrmachtso much so when it reached the gates to Moscow German strength ebbed,eroded considerably.Now on the approaches to Moscow Germans encountered fresh Russian resistance.Appearance of T-34 tanks in large numbers -impervious to German anti-tank guns- stunned Nazis.This shows how much they underestimated Russian colossus;exposes faulty nature of German intelligence prelude to Barbarossa.<br /><br />Germans could hope overcoming this final barrier only by bringing in fresh troops,rearming and refuelling their emasculated armoured spearheads.This was not possible because of poor quality Russian roads and failure to put int operational use of Russian railway network.The errors further aggravated by Hitler's failure to moblise German economy for 'TotalWar'.Army Group Centre launched its final bid to seize Moscow without receiving any reinforcements.<br /><br />Author has demolished the view of some Historians that Moscow could have been taken had Hitler not diverted Gen Guderian's Second Panzer Group toward Kiev.Fact is after reduction Smolensk pocket considerable Soviet forces remained which barred the road to Moscow.This prompted Hitler go for a easy prey.This manoeuvre in turn created conditions for a successful start of the offensive along Moscow axis[operation Typhoon]<br /><br />Account of Barbarossa is incomplete without stressing the contribution of Richard Sorge,Soviet spy attached to the German embassy in Tokyo.After all where did Stalin find forces which barred German road to Moscow? Fro the Far East thanks Sorge's intelligence that Japan was going to attack US which helped Soviet leader ruthlessly denudeFar Eastern front rush Siberians to defend Moscow.Later Marshal Zhukov used Siberians divisions to launch Moscow counter-offensive.An author of Glantz's stature has remained silent about this,and I find hard to digest.<br /><br />Despite this drawback this book will remain an indispensible source for those who want to know why Barbarossa ended in a fiasco.ian resistance.Appearance of T-34 tanks in large numbers -impervious to German anti-tank guns- stunned Nazis.This shows how much they underestimated Russian colossus;exposes faulty nature of German intelligence prelude to Barbarossa. <br /> <br />Germans could hope overcoming this final barrier only by bringing in fresh troops,rearming and refuelling their emasculated armoured spearheads.This was not possible because of poor quality Russian roads and failure to put int operational use of Russian railway network.The errors further aggravated by Hitler's failure to moblise German economy for 'TotalWar'.Army Group Centre launched its final bid to seize Moscow without receiving any reinforcements. <br /> <br />Author has demolished the view of some Historians that Moscow could have been taken had Hitler not diverted Gen Guderian's Second Panzer Group toward Kiev.Fact is after reduction Smolensk pocket considerable Soviet forces remained which barred the road to Moscow.This prompted Hitler go for a easy prey.This manoeuvre in turn created conditions for a successful start of the offensive along Moscow axis[operation Typhoon] <br /> <br />Account of Barbarossa is incomplete without stressing the contribution of Richard Sorge,Soviet spy attached to the German embassy in Tokyo.After all where did Stalin find forces which barred German road to Moscow?

If so,Wehrmacht paid dearly for it.<br /><br />I feel Kursk assault goes agains fundamentals of Blitzkrieg.For the first time in the war Germans used armour as a battering ram and they ran smack into deeply-echeloned Soviet defences .What ensued was a grinding combat.<br /><br />Assault by Model's Ninth Army in the northern face of the salient was quickly contained.However things in the south where Herman Hoth's Fourth Panzer army launched its thrust appeared bleak.After tense,anxious moments Marshal Vatutin managed to stop German assault.Armoured clash at Prokhorovka was the turning piont of the campaign.It must be said Germans in a brilliant move tried to open a indirect route to Kursk by passing Katukov's First Guards Tank Army at Oboian.However this led to a head-on collision with Pavel Rotmistrov's Fifth Guards Tank army  which formed the part of Marshal Ivan Koniev's Steppe front.  German intelligence failed to detect its presence east of Kursk bulge.This explains German failure to break through Soviet defences.<br /><br />Apart from this-in my humble opinion -they were three other reasons which ensured German defeat at Kursk.Firstly, failure of Panzer Detachment Kempf to adequately screen the flank of IInd SS Panzer corps.Kempf's detachment had it  kept pace with the advance IInd Panzer Corps could have blocked the approach of Rotmistrov's tanks toward Prokhorovka.<br /><br /> This reminds me what happened to Napoleon when he strove to breach Wellington's defense at waterloo.Marshal Grouchy was assigned to protect Napoleon's right flank,but he failed.Prussian General Bluecher forces suddenly appeared on the scene throwing latter's plans into disarray.<br /><br />Incessant Soviet counter-attacks meant Germans diverting more and more of their armour to protect vulnerable flanks.This was because Germans lacked sufficent infantry to do the job which considerably whittled down German armour strength and breakthrough attempt lost its punch. Further absence of Strategic Aviation prevented Luftwaffe from bombing Soviet railroad network which would have blocked the movement Red Army reserves.<br /><br />The above facts does not in any way belittle scale of Soviet victory.For the first time in war Russians showed that German Blitzkrieg could be halted.Stavka accurately determined probable axes of German advance..Soviets went on fortify these routes by building several lines of resistance.Important points were converted into miniature fortress.Besides Soviets concenterated tremendous reserves amounting to 5 Tank Mechanised armies.The immense depth of Soviet defences fully absorbed shock of German attack.After wearing down German assault Red Army swiftly launched massive,sprawling counter-offensive which sent Germans reeling.<br /><br />The book has exploded number of myths of Kursk battle.Foremost being Germans would have been victorious had they not kept postponing attack.Authors ridicule the claims of German Generals for imputing failure of attack on Hitler.<br /><br />I feel this book the best written on battle of Kursk Bulge.Essential, must reading for people interested in Eastern Front in World War II.ies.The immense depth of Soviet defences fully absorbed shock of German attack.After wearing down German assault Red Army swiftly launched massive,sprawling counter-offensive which sent Germans reeling.

Desert War than Barnett's Desert Generals.By all means a revisionist history ,the book traces the careers of five British Generals in North Africa: O'Connor,Cunnigham,Ritchie,Auchinleck,Montgomery.Their operations represent collective British effort in preventing Rommel's Deutsche Afrika Korps from seizing Egypt, Middle East.<br /><br />The book opens with brilliant campaign of Maj Gen O'Connor which began as a raid but climaxed in the Battle of Bedda Fomm resulting in the destruction Rudolpho Graziani's Italian Tenth army.Unfortunately British political establishment in London failed to exploit this victory.O'Connor's Western Desert force could have easily taken Tripolitania thus completing the conquest of Italian North African empire.Instead forces were diverted to Greece .This was a blunder of monumental proportions for which Churchill must be held accountable.<br /><br />The diversion prolonged North African campaign,for it helped Germans land troops in Tripolitania.Besides forces assigned to the Far East were sucked into the defence of egypt ;consequently British were unable to resist Japanese onslaught.Author also is highly critical of Churchill's direction of war in North African theatre.PMs continous prodding led to Battle Axe-premature offensive to defeat Rommel-which ended in a fiasco.Ultimately Gen Wavell was made the scapegoatand had to resign.<br /><br />Poor British performance continued under generals who succeded O'Connor.How can we explain heavy British defeats in Desert War?<br />Author says this was due to poor,faulty armoured tactics.During Crusader offensive General Cunnigham split the armour across length and breadth of the battle field.Instead armour should have been massed enabling it to strike like a clenched fist.Cardinal failure of British was unlike Germans they failed to organise Combined Arms Teams with tank as the pivot.Mad onrush of tanks against fixed German defences without artillery support led to heavy losses.Barnett attributes this to comparmentalised,orthodox ,regimental tradition of British army.<br /><br />British tactical conduct of battle improved considerably under Gen Auchinleck's dynamic leadership.Author calls Auk as the man who saved Egypt.Against this it must be said when Rommel started probing Egypt's defences Afrika korps had shot its bolt.Ammunition and fuel shortages -due to failure of Axis High Command to neutralise Malta-crippled the movement of German armour.Besides Rommel had lost the services of his efficent Radio Intelligence Service commanded by Alfred Seebohm.With the result he had no idea of British plans ,intentions ,capabilities and was now boxing in the dark.<br /><br />On the other hand his opponent had a clear picture of Rommel's intentions thanks to Enigma decrypts.Auchinleck's calculated aggression helped British defend Egypt.Swift punches here, there unhinged Rommel throwing his battle plans into disarray.<br /><br />The book contains virulent criticism of Montgomery's generalship.Firstly ,author condemns Montgomery for claiming credit for repelling Rommel at Alam Halfa.Facts show the plan for repelling German assault had been devised by Auchinleck with the help of his brilliant chief of staff Eric Dorman Smith.Montgomery while becoming Commander of desert army inherited those plans and put them into effect.With the battle progressing favorably ,Montgomery ,according to the author,botched the opportunity of annhilating Rommel's Panzer Armee.He could have done so by unleashing his armour from Alam Halfa ridge which would have descended into the Africa Korps rear- at a time when it had bitten deep into British defences-severing it from its base.There would have been no El-Alamein then.<br /><br />Further author impugns the wisdom of fighting this set- piece battle.Auchinleck's successful defence of Egypt prompted the Allies to sent a expeditionary force to North Africa.Landings which were to be effected on Rommel's rear would have compelled him to abandon fixed defences and withdraw.British then could have launched their superior mechanised forces to cut off retreating Germans.Instead yearning for national prestige made them fight a  battle  which came close to disaster.<br /><br />Author faults Montgomery's breakthrough plan .Armour was used a battering ram.Sheer weight of metal helped Eighth Army hack,crunch their way through German defences.Despite suffering tremendous losses Montgomery knew that victory would be his.Thanks to Ultra, he knew German strength was ebbing away.If he could sustain this attrition for few more days enemy would break.This happened precisely.Despite possessing superior mobility British failed to cut off retreating Germans owing to the chaotic nature of their advance.<br /><br />All the above are intresting observations which have combined to demolish Montgomery myth.No doubt book raised a storm when it was first published in 1960.I feel author has displayed remarkable courage,intellectual honesty in challenging the established views  which made this book military classic.and withdraw.British then could

Under the circumstances Soviets were not in a position to intiate a revolutionary war.<br /><br />Prelude to the outbreak of Great Patriotic War Soviet leader received innumerable warnings pointing towards Hitler's preparations to invade Russia. But he refused to alert frontier defences Why? This is a intruiging question which has continued to confound observers of the scene.Author has furnished answers to this riddle.According Gorodetsky contradictory,complex nature of the information emanating from different sources regarding Wehrmacht's deployment along Soviet Union's western borders spawned a sense of ambiguity in Stalin's mind. In short, intelligence picture appeared confusing.This hobbled Soviet response to the danger looming across the border.For more information on this kindly refer the book.<br /><br />Further author says Hitler by invading Soviet Union was not strictly following the ideological blueprint enunciated in Mein Kampf.Confrontation with Soviet Union came about due to conflicting interests in the Balkans.Hitler thought Soviet refusal to come to terms was instigated by the British.So he decided to punish Stalin.Nazi diplomacy prior to the invasion of Soviet Union sought to expand Axis grouping by including Russia.Attempts were made to substitute Ribbentrop-Molotov pact by a 4-power pact[Germany,Russia,Japan,Italy].This will delimit spheres of influence of each nation leading to the emergence of Continental Bloc contributing to the early demise of British Empire.Soviet leader incurred Hitler's wrath by refusing to be a part of it.<br /><br />To sum up Gorodetsky's work is an important contribution to our understanding of events which unfolded across European chess board between 1940-41.

Author gives an excellent account of run up of events leading up to the Anglo-American assault on Iraq.Author's arguments unassailable based on irrefutable logic.<br /><br />Economic considerations prompted US UK to invade Iraq.Of late US has become vulnerable to energy shocks with domestic production unable to cope with increasing demand.This has led to occasional blackouts in places like California.Prior to Iraq war America's oil inventories fell to the lowest level since  1975 with the country on the verge of drawing oil from 'Strategic Petroluem Reserve'<br /><br />Iraq under Saddam Hussein was becoming what author says a ' swing producer'.In other words he was turning oil tap on and off whenever Baghdad felt that such a policy was suiting its interests.Hussein even contemplated removing Iraqi oil from the market for extended periods of time which would have sent crude oil prices soaring.<br /><br />Besides Hussein began to challenge US monoply on oil trade.We all know oil trade is transacted in dollars.Hussein switched the trade to Euros.As a result dollar's value diminished by 17 percent.Were other oil-producing countries like Nigeria, Iran Venezuela to follow suit dollar's value would erode.Hussein's measures , in short, threatned America's economic , military pre-eminence.So he was ousted replaced by pro western stooge subservient Illad Allawi.<br /><br />Bush- Blair team went to absurd lengths to justify invasion of Iraq.Intelligence on Iraq's WMD capability was cooked up distorted ,exaggerated to bolster case for war .Blair even had the gumption to claim that Iraq had lethal weapons which could be activated in 45 mts and was poised to strike British bases in Cyprus.An argument that sound ridiculous because we know from inde sources between a period from 1992-98 98 percent of Iraq WMD was destroyed along with infrastructure to make those weapons. Bush-Blair team ,I feel ,deliberately mislead their people to make a case for war.<br /><br />Fact goes that Iraq could be invaded easily because it did not have weapons to defend herself.Britain US saw to it Iraq was fully disarmed begore unleashing their armies.In this they were helped by UN Security council which did the dirty work of disarming Iraq.It looks  from this train of events that ' right to self-defence ' belongs to few coutries in the west.This a a covert form of racism.Be that may, US UK have taught coutries like N Korea ,Syria, Iran an ugly lesson better arm yourself with nuclear weapons if you want ot deter possible future hostile action.<br /><br />What US UK want unfettered, unrestrained access to oil of resource-rich Middle East.What they fear most is indigenous nationalsm.

Budiansky has virtually ignored Eastern Front despite the fact former Soviet Union bore brunt of war against Nazi Germany.I feel this to be a manifestation of author's cold war mentality unfortunately prevalent among few academics in the West.<br />What we do not know even today wheather Russians too read German ciphers.Soviet dictator Stalin definitely knew about Ultra thanks to Kim Philby and Cambridge spyring.Soviets had a spy network operating in the Nazi-occupied Europe [Red Orchestra].Information it provided influenced some crucial battles fought on the Eastern Front.For details refer Red Orchestra by Tarrant V.E.<br />To sum up,Budiansky's work is highly Anglo-American centric.To call this book-as given in the title'Complete story of codebreaking in World War II'- is actually misnomer.	2004-06-02

Much of this booklet is an interview conducted by William R. Pitt with Scott Ritter ,UN weapons inspector who worked in Iraq.The interview exposes mendacious, deceitful nature of Bush Jr administration.American people were prevented from knowing the truth about nature of war unleashed upon Iraq which they were called to support.<br />Ritter says Iraq was virtually disarmed with much of its WMD capability way back in 1998.Shocking to know UN weapons inspection team called UNSCOM headed by an Australian diplomat Richard Butler were doing things which had nothing to do disarming Iraq.It was collecting intelligence about Saddam's whereabouts .Aim was to provokeIraqis.Inspection team would soon be expelled which then would serve as a cover to bomb that country. Further Ritter says that Saddam's regime ,though brutal ,was secular by nature.No evidence to show Baa'thists had links with Osama Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network.To the contrary Osama and his cohorts despised Baa'thist govt ,sought its ouster.<br />So why did Anglo-Americans invade Iraq?Primarily because there was a veiled agenda of controlling Iraq's fabulous oil wealth.Also over the years ruling circles in US and UK developed a visceral hatred towards Saddam Hussein as media in both countries continued to demonise him.Despite Saddam repeatedly giving into American demands by opening more more sites for inspection ,he had to go.Revelations by former senior  administrationofficials also point to this direction.Paul O'Neill once Treasury Sec in Bush Jr administration reveals  in his memoirs 'The Price of Loyalty'few in Bush administration had contemplated attacking Iraq long before Sep 11 terrorist attacks in US.Also former head head of counter-terrorism branch of NSA Richard Clark makes the same point in his book 'Against All Enemies'This again calls into question the sincerity of this administration in fighting terrorism unleashed by Islamic fundamentalists.<br />One is forced to conclude after reading this booklet  American foreign policy is in tatters.This administration is amoral ,unethical, poltically and morally corrupt.et  American foreign policy is in tatters.This administration is amoral ,unethical, poltically and morally corrupt.	2004-04-07

But the outbreak of war with Japan, author was recalled to service which helped him to revive his foundering career.Cdr Holmes was directly involved in some of the intelli ops narrated in this book.<br /><br />I don't endorse author's argument that Japanese launched a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.Orthodox historians of Pacific war have continued to assert this myth.Robert B.Stinnett author of Day of Deceit :The truth about FDR and Pearl Harbor has convincingly debunked this argument.Be that may,Cdr Holmes at CIU handled intelli material of exceptional strategic and tactical importance.This stemmed from the penetration of Japanese naval ciphers.Author fed this to COMSUBPAC sub branch of US Pacific Fleet.<br /><br />Particularly interesting is the breaking of Japanse MARU [convoy] codes.As a result US subs were ideally positoned to intercept Jap convoys which sailed into a trap. Reader must understand the significance of this breakthrough.Decryption of Jap codes meant that US subs need not had to scout vast Pacific ocean in search of elusive convoys.As the days progressed more more attacks came to be guided by radio intelligence.<br /><br />I am apalled by the fact Japanese despite incidents like shooting down of Adm Yamamoto's aircraft by American fighters ,elimination of IJN's sub picket lines by US ASW forces did not realise that IJN codes were compromised.How can one explain this phenomenon? Japanese conceit ,arrogance;perhaps they thought intricacies of Japanese language were an added guarantee that IJN codes cannot be penetrated.<br /><br />Author has explained the structure of US intelligence- gathering organisation in Hawaii.To conclude,book shows how much America relied on good intelligence in prosecuting Pacific war.Author has explained the structure of US intelligence- gathering organisation in Hawaii.To conclude,book shows how much America relied on good intelligence in prosecuting Pacific war.	2003-11-24

I rate Toland's book the best on Pacific war.<br /><br />Author has plumbed into the subject;traced the root causes which led to outbreak of hostilities between US and Japanese Empire.Toland offers penetrating insights into Japanese manners,philosophy and customs.<br /><br />Japan's expansionist designs particularly Tokyo's decision to carve out an empire in China set it on a collision course with US.If the Japanese had confined their aggression to Manchuria it would not have antagonised the Americans .But army hotheads wanted whole of China under Tokyo's heel.This soured relations with US and can be said as the starting point of Pacific war.<br /><br />War in China proved disastrous for Japan and for Chiang Kai-Sheikh's nationalist Kuomintang party ,for it enfeebled both.Power vacuum ensued and Communists under Mao stepped in .Author says Marcopolo bridge incident ,which led to full-scale war in China, may have been a communist provocation .There are reasons to believe that it may be so.<br /><br />During summer of 1940 Tokyo firmly aligned with Axis powers.Tripartite pact was signed.With exit of pro Nazi foreign minister Matsuoka Japan's posture changed.Moderate Konoye govt sought an understanding with US.Author explains how attempts to resolve differences proved futile.American intrasigence is partially to be blamed for ensuing tragedy.To this can be added the intricacies of Japanese language;mistranslations which crept into decoded Japanese messages  generated misunderstandings which finally wrecked negotiations.Author has given accurate translation of intercepted Japanese cables.<br /><br />Japan's defeat in Pacific war can be pinned down to following reasons:Japanese empire overextended and found forces woefully inadequate to defend its vast conquests.Remember big chunk of Japanese army was locked up in a debilitating ,inconclusive struggle to subdue China.IJN neglect of antisub warfare.Ships started sailing in convoys belatedly.Submarine assests were frittered away;used for scouting and screening main battle fleet besides attacking enemy warships.Instead subs should have been used to attacking US navy's supply lines streching all the way from the western seaboard of US.<br /><br />Wheather IJN would have emerged triumphant had a such course of action been adopted is hard to say.But I feelTokyo had the chance of prolonging the war.America had overwhelming , superior fire power at her disposal.<br /><br />Intelligence was Washington's  trump card in Pacific war.At this point I recall Friedrich ,the philospher king of Prussia said about intelligence.'If you know enemy plans before you will be more than a match for him even with inferior numbers'.So it proved in the battles of Coral sea and Midway where Japanese were thwarted.<br /><br />War ended with the advent of atomic age.Nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was totally uncalled for.Japan was willing to surrender despite oppositon from die-hard militarists.<br /><br />To sum up ,Toland's book is impeccably researched and richly detailed revisionist account of Pacific war.Anyone interested in Pacific theatre in[World War II] will definitely savor reading it.main battle fleet besides attacking enemy warships.Instead subs should have been used to attacking US navy's supply lines streching all the way from the western seaboard of US.

Author's account of events surrounding the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki does not do justice this book.Neither erudite nor analytical the book mostly reads like a Truman apologia.Book does not contain any fresh insights and is just a rehash of what has written earlier by other historians.<br /><br />Whatever arguments Truman and his team have resorted to justify nuclear bombing does not carry weight upon a closer analysis.There was no need for Americans to invade Japanese mainland.Japan was pulverized from the air by American bombers and US Navy subs had imposed a virtual maritime blockade so much so that ordinary Japanese had started feeling the pinch.If Americans had kept up this devastating attacks for a few more months ,Japan would have collapsed.This has also been the opinion of America's leading soldiers.However President and his men had no patience for this form of warfare.<br /><br />If the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan was prompted by a desire to intimidate Soviet Union ,as author has endeavoured to show ,then one must admit that incident backfired.Stalin saw to it Soviet Union was not subjected to an American nuclear blackmail by quickly developing a nuclear deterrent.<br /><br />Japan was willing to surrender despite opposition from die-hard militarists. But only obstacle was they sought clarification about Emperor's status;never wanted emperorhood abolished.President thanks to media propaganda had a warped view about Japanese;considered them scounderels for launching a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor thus deserving terrible punishment.If Truman had endorsed this Japanese demand which he later accepted the horrible human tragedy could have been averted.<br /><br />Conditional ultimatum while issuing Potsdam declaration would have ensured Japan's surrender.	2003-09-17

Japanese strategy had been to forge a huge defence perimeter by capturing the outlying islands in the Pacific.The defence perimeter would be so strong that Americans will find exceedingly difficult in breaching it.Battered,exhausted Tokyo thought Americans would then sue for peace.Here Nipponese made a serious miscalculation.At a time when Japan was engaged in a protracted war to subdue China, how did it expect Americans to react differently when it itself was keen to stake its honour  in China rather than withdrawing and courting humiliation.<br /><br />Under the circumstances best thing for the Japanese to do create conditions where by America is bought to war grudgingly.This would have sowed the seeds of exhaustion which would have germinated during the course of time.Here it must be said majority of American people were isolationist though that cannot be said of the President.Pearl Harbor attack was a bolt from the blue for the Americans;a blunder of first magnitude.It inflamed public opinion in the country,tantamount to waking up a sleeping lion.Imbued now with fierce resolve they were determined to bring culprit to book.Irony of the situation, Yamamoto knew America its vast economic and industrial might having served there as a naval attache.The Yanks had resources and determination to overcome any obstacle thrown across their path.<br /><br />Americans were dynamic and mechanically -minded people capable of considerable violence when aroused.Instead of attacking Pearl Harbor if IJN had stuck to the plan conceived by the Japanese Navy General Staff of intercepting and engaging the US Fleet on the approaches to Japanese islands chances were that Tokyo could have effected a second Tsushima.USN<br />precisely envisaged such a course of action during the intial phase of Pacific war.RAINBOW plan called for American fleet storming its way across<br />Pacific to seek a decisive battle with IJN near Japanese archipalego.<br /><br />At Midway Yamamoto committed the cardinal error of splitting up IJN thus courting destruction.Wiser disposition of forces would have led to different outcome of the battle.If Yamamoto and Nagumo had operated together,  former big battleships would have screened the carriers.Their tremendous firepower would have diverted American dive bombers from ill-fated carriers.To be fair, Yamamoto  was served by a man who was timid,pussilanimous by nature.Remember, during Pearl Harbor raid despite repeated pleas by Cap Fuchida for destroying oil storage tanks and dock yard facilities in a second strike, Nagumo panicked.It helped USN to quickly regain strength. Fortune favors the brave.Further ability of US naval intelli to read Japanese navy's operational codes seriously compromise its operations.<br /><br />I am unable to comment upon Adm Yamamoto conduct of operations in the south Pacific.My knowledge on this aspect of Pacific war is not sufficently deep.But reasons are not far to seek.Japanese suffering from victory disease;arrogant overconfidence,showing contempt for enemies.This explains why they intially used a small contigent of troops[Ichiki detachment]in trying to dislodge US marines firmly entrenched at Henderson airfield ,Guadalcanal.Tragically,Yamamoto perished at the hands of his foes while visiting Japanese outposts in south Pacific.contempt for enemies.This explains why they intially used a small contigent of troops[Ichiki detachment]in trying to dislodge US marines firmly entrenched at Henderson airfield ,Guadalcanal.Tragically,Yamamoto perished at the hands of his foes while visiting Japanese outposts in south Pacific.	2003-08-13

Russia is shown to be perfidious country which betrayed Western Allies.This is a gross distortion of truth because facts show by 1916 the Russian armies had lost its cutting edge.Army was wracked with strife and desertion.Russia was not in position to help her allies even if it had wanted to.No other person other than British Special Commissioner R.H Bruce Lockhartwould vouch for this fact.So Lenin concluded an armistice with Germany.However Lenin was willing to continue the war provided Western allies had continued to furnish material support for the Bolsheviks which they refused.These were the circumstances which led to the signing of Brest Litovsk treaty of Mar 3,1918.Author condoned Marshal Pilsudski's poland invading Russia in 1920.But Russian counter-offensive to evict Polish invaders is interpreted as communist expansionism ;what a hypocrisy .Coming to World War II:Hitler invaded Poland and author says Stalin got the war he wanted.Author has either ignored or is ignorant of the fact that from 1934 onward Soviet Union tried consistently to forge joint front in Europe to forge a joint front to resist Nazi aggression.Western democracies did not co-operate which drove Soviets into the hands of Nazi Germany.Further author says the war ended in a tragedy for the West.Because end of the World War II saw Red Army on the banks of River Elbe.The reason Britain failed to pursue its traditional balance -of-power policy;instead,war was reduced to Manichean terms.Under this scheme Russia was to be used for containing German ambhitions.<br />But I doubt Tory establishment in London would have pursued such a course of action.They would have liked Germany and Russia fight and mutually exhaust themselves which would have helped the British to establish hegemony in postwar Europe.Churchillwent to war because he doubted Hitler's ambhitions would remain confined to the east.Having borne brunt of the war author wants Russia denied the spoils of victory.This was to be done by curbing Western aid for Soviet war effort.Most reckless in British scheme of things was Churchill's attempts to sent Allied forces through Llblujana gap in Istrian peninsula towards central north eastern Europe .This force would come astride Red army formations moving towards Berlin. Such a course of events could have possibly triggered a Third World War.Concurrently every help was to be given to reactionary elements in Berlin to seize power while ousting Hitler.<br />Fuller justifies all this by quoting Clausewitz where war is form of political intercourse.Aim of war is is moderation not complete overthrow of enemy.This is a dangerous doctrine.Sometimes moderation pays.But decision to wage total war ,I believe, depends on nature and characer of enemy.Against vicious and a wicked foe moderation will never pay.Unconditonal surrender in Nazi Germany's case was justified.Because anything short of it would have helped the remaining Nazis to regain strengh and renew its assault upon humanity.<br />Thus one can see author is biased ,hypocritical in interpretation of facts which seriously detracts the value of this book.t to war because he doubted Hitler's ambhitions would remain confined to the east.Having borne brunt of the war author wants Russia denied the spoils of victory.This was to be done by curbing Western aid for Soviet war effort.Most reckless in British scheme of things was Churchill's attempts to sent Allied forces through Llblujana gap in Istrian peninsula towards central north eastern Europe .This force would come astride Red army formations moving towards Berlin.

It proves  Washington had foreknowledge  of Japanese attack.<br /><br />However the crucial intercepts were not brought to the notice of Adm Kimmel nor were they placed at the disposal of Joint Congressional Committe probing pearl harbor tragedy Why? Because it formed a part of a extensive cover up to exonerate FDRand other senior administration officials.  Stinnett has pieced togeher the testimonies of key American cryptanalysts to support this contention.<br /><br />US naval intelligence was able to track the assembly of Nagumo's task force at Hittokapu bay near Kurile islands.Author says that Japanese fleet for reasons beyond its control was unable to maintain radio silence during its descent on Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />American RDF stations along the Pacific rim intercepted these signals.Thus US intelligence was able accurately plot the movement of Nagumo's task force well in advance.But again crucial intelligence was denied to Kimmel.Author's revelations exonerate Kimmel and Short of any gross dereliction of duty.<br /><br />Perhaps explosive of all revelations being McCollum memorandum. Keeping in line with this document FDR deliberately courted disaster to bring US into war against the Axis.Arthur H.McCollum served in the Far Eastern section of ONI.Series of measeaures proposed by him provoked Japan into opening hostilities.The memorandum hitherto top-secret document but author has used previleges conferred by FOIA to dig it out.<br /><br />Poor Adm Kimmel and Gen Short , little did they know they were used as pawns in diabolical  plot hatched by MCCollum with FDR's connivance to draw Japan into war.And it shows how wily and cruel a politician could be.Adm Kimmel was disgraced ,demoted and left the navy as a shattered man.<br /><br />The Japanese militarists by expanding war in China , Indo-china played into the hands of FDR and his men.In my view the talk about Japanese imperialism is tinged with hypocrisy.What not European powers do to China starting with first opium war which culminated in Boxer rebellion.I feel Japanese expansionism in China seriosly jeopardised the American commercial interests.At stake was America's Open Door policy in China.Remember long time ago Soviet revolutionary V.I. Lenin predicted clash between Japanese and American imperialisms.<br /><br />However author having exposed FDR's deceit pivots his book on a false premise.I cannot agree with Stinnett's conclusion that Roosevelt dragged America into war to save western world from Nazi tyranny.Because for a long time western democracies were courting Fascist dictators.There  was a possiblity Hitler having finished with Russia can turn around and attack western interests.So democracies went to war against Axis.<br /><br />Be that may,the book has vindicated my view on Pearl Harbor.I have been always of the opinion that FDR and his team had foreknowledge of Japanese attack.ound and attack western interests.So democracies went to war against Axis.

Then course of history would have been different.But British leadership's moral blindness ,hatred for Communism such a splendid opportunity was botched.<br /><br />Getting back to the point,Moscow talks served in my opinion to put pressure on Germany How? I refer to secret talks between Horace Wilson and Goering's representive Karl Wohltat in London.Germany was told to come to terms, renounce its aggressive designs on western Europe .If not ,Berlin would be assailed on both flanks wih Russia's help.This precisely had been Hitler's nightmare. Unfortunately authors have missed this crucial point.Ultimately Moscow talks failed because West wanted Soviet Union to vouch for Poland's security without giving any reciprocal guarantees to the soviets.This made Soviets suspicious about real motives of Western leaders .The double-dealing led soviets to sign non-aggression pact with Germany.<br /><br />The Western democracies went to war against Germany because it committed apostasy by courting the Soviet devil.But secret channels remained open.Behind public gaze British leaders stll hoped to resurrect their secret deal this time with moderate Nazis by ousting Hitler from power.<br /><br />Chamberlin policy boomeranged.Hitler reposed no faith Chamberlin ability to deliver goods.Nazi leader chose to free his rear before attacking Soviet Union.Appeasment policy now lay in tatters.<br /><br />Appendix section of the book I find it very interesting.Here authors have evaluated ,critically analysed works of other historians on Chamberlin's appeasment policy.Historians-Alan Bullock,AJP Taylor,Donald C. Watt Simon Newman ,Paul Kennedy-have exonerated the British leader of any wrong deeds by projecting him to be apostle of peace. All evidence to the  contrary either fudged or ignored Why?They were reluctant to admit that leader of a Western democracy could collaborate with a dictator who was hell-bent on going to war to realise his ambitions.<br /><br />Such distortion of facts tantamount to pulling wool over the eyes of the public.This book has presented British politicians in the true light.These men instead of stopping Hitler shamelessly connived,collaborated ,co operated with the Nazi leader.Hyocrites,they were parially responsible for the outbreak of World War II and Holocaust that ensued.<br /><br />The book represents a complete reappraisal of events leading to World War II.For me the facts contained in the book were nothing new.Having read the books of Soviet historians of war [Vladimir Trukhanovsky, Oleg Rzhevsky]I am aware of it.However this may be first time that few people in the West have come to acknowledge this unpalatable truth which for a long time dubbed communist as propaganda.on Newman ,Paul Kennedy-have exonerated the British leader of any wrong deeds by projecting him to be apostle of peace.

U boats now coming from different directions converging towards target thus formed a pack.This constituted an effective tactical riposte to the convoy: concentration of defending force vis a vis corresponding concentration of attacking forces.Advances in the field of W/T made this manoeuvre feasible.<br /><br />Despite the novelty of the system often convoys sneaked through U boat cordon.A fact which symbolises the im mensity of the ocean.Thus Adm Doenitz tactical problem was intercepting convoys.It was precisely here that radio intelligence came in.Radio intelligence helped the U boat command pin-point the position of the convoys. Immedietly U boats were put across its track.From early 1942 many of pack attacks came to be guided by Sigint.<br /><br />But during the early phase of the war attacks took palace in and around British isles where bulk of shipping Britain's overseas empire converged.Pack attacks launched on the surface during nights caught British defences napping.Since Asdic could not detect surfaced U boat.However since U boats mostly operated on the surface it gave scope for radar detection.As author says the outcome of the campaign was influenced by technical innovations.Most important being ASV III radar fitted into coastal command aircraft which started patrolling sealanes.<br /><br />Radar robbed U boats of its invisibility and pack attacks became difficult whenever convoys came under the range of aircover.Often U boat had to submerge thus losing contact with the convoy. From autumn 1942 onwards most of the escort groups had one vessel which carried automatic high frequency direction finder FH4 which can intercept the first contact signal of U boat.Then a destroyer homed in onthe bearing forcing U boat to submerge and lose contact with convoy.<br /><br />Mention should also be made of role played by OIC of Admiralty in foiling pack attacks.Author has rightly dubbed it as nerve centre of anti U boat war.British penetration of German naval enigma cipher made posible evasive routing of convoys.In short ,Doenitz U boat packs were mastered by superior technology :combination of airpower ,radar, HF-DF cryptanalysis,improved depth charges better escorting techniques etc.<br /><br />By May 1943 U boats were defeated but struggle for establishing technological dominance continued as Doenitz again planned to hurl his favourite weapon against AngloAmerican supply lines after making them invisible to Allied air and surface escorts.Snorkelled U boats which appeared by Jan 1944 to a great extent helped evade radar detection .By early 1945 submarines emerged. This marked the beginning of a new era U boat war since it rendered all Allied ASW techniques obsolete.<br /><br />Author has termed the phenomenon as'unappealing lanscape of square one'.To sum up,considering the level of technology prevalent at that time war against U boats was immensely complex ,sophisticated campaign.This book impecabbly researched,and I consider best available on the subject.<br /><br />Erudite and lavisly detailed;brimming with statistics on U boat war also contain tables on U boat losses.t war since it rendered all Allied ASW techniques obsolete.

Japanese aircraft patrolling seaways never had RWR[radar warning receiver]which would have helped to detect emissions from target locating radars aboard US boats.<br /><br />Above faults exacerbated by reluctance of Japanese naval leadership to allocate adequate destroyers for escort duties.So the US subs came to exercise a stranglehold over Tokyo's seaborne trade.<br /><br />I must say much of American fatalities stemmed from the overconfidence of US subcommand.<br /><br />Padfield's account of U boat war is just a rehash of what had been written earlier by other historians and does not contain any fresh insights.Author's contention that U boat offensive to choke Britain's seaborne trade lost its sting by mid 1941 ,is difficult to endorse. Padfield rests his thesis on the succesful penetration of German naval enigma cipher which made rerouting possible around waiting U boat packs.While not belittling this development I feel Hitler's decision to divert boats to other theatres of war made a big impact on the course of campaign.More boats in the Atlantic would have meant more eyes for locating convoys.<br /><br />Biggest flaw of this book is most of author's comments are ambigously couched.In the concluding portions of the book author has acknowledged the potency of German U boat arm;that it very nearly brought Britain to its knees.So is the case with atom bombing of Japan which Padfield justifies at the same time arguing that continuation of US sub campaign would have sufficed to bring its capitulation.<br /><br />Few of author's political pronouncements sound hypocritical especially on the build up of events climaxing in the outbreak of Pacific war.To conclude: book is biased ,subjective.came to exercise a stranglehold over Tokyo's seaborne trade.

Admiral Karl Doenitz the architect of U- boat campaign in World War II which nearly brought Allied powers to the brink of a defeat.Britain particularly vulnerable to this form of war since London depended on  overseas colonies for much of her economic sustenance.<br /><br />Battle of Atlantic unarguably the most bitter ,protracted  campaign of World War II where fortunes of rival navies fluctuated widely.This was a campaign whose outcome to a large extent determined by technical innovations.<br /><br />In the opening chapters of the book Doenitz recounts his experiences as a U-boat commanderin the Mediterrenean theatre in World War I.This made him evolve wolf-pack tactics for assailing Allied merchant shipping which sailed in convoys.Belated introduction of convoy took the sting out of U-boat offensive in World War I.Independent sailing of ships offered U-boats plenty of targets.Now number of targets shrank with large expanses of water virtually devoid of shipping.<br /><br /> Doenitz developed an antidote to the convoy by  spreading the U-boats out across probable path of a convoy.Once a U-boat is able to sight a convoy it got in touch with shore HQs which in turn vectored other U-boats in the neighbourhood towards the target.This formed an effective tactical riposte to the convoy:concentration of merchant shipping defending escort forces with corresponding concentration of attacking forces.Remarkable strides in the field of wireless telegraphy made this possible.<br /><br />British remained complacent about U-boat menace.Development of Asdic,convoy ,Prize rules governing the conduct of war at sea account for British optimism.But Doenitz employing U-boats on the surface enmasse during nights to deliver concentrated attacks rendered Asdic impotent. Despite establishing patrol lines  Atlantic ocean still offered sufficent room for convoys to evade contact.Occasionally convoys slipped through U-boat cordon.<br /><br />Here radio intelligence helped the U-boat Command.BAMS Code No 3 directing convoy traffic was broken by XB-Dienst the cryptanalytical branch of of German naval intelligence .As a result, Doenitz could exactly plot the course taken by the convoys.Thus during the outbreak of hostilities U-boat command had an edge over Allied ASW measures.<br /><br />By spring of 1941 U-boats had taken a dreadful toll of British shipping with over 400 ships sunk which represented a rate of sinking twice that of new construction.Admiralty belatedly took measures to curb U-boat menace.Despite all the damage wreaked by U-boats it was by no means invincible.<br /><br />Actually, U-boat was not a submarine but a submersible since it operated mostly on the surface ,diving only to escape destruction.This gave scope for ship or airborne radar detection.Then U-boat while co-ordinating manoeuvres for launching massed assault generated thick volume of signal traffic.This was picked up HF-DF aboard convoy escorts.Soon a U-boat will find a destroyer streaking towards it forcing it to submerge thus losing contact with the convoy.This frequent chatter turned out to be achilles heel of Doenitz wolf-pack tactics.<br /><br />By mid-1941 British succesfully penetrated German naval Enigma cipher. Allies now knew where Doenitz was sending his boats to form patrol lines.More and more convoys were steered away from waiting U-boat packs ; precious shipping was thus saved.<br /><br />Doenitz dwelts extensively in his memoirs about the problem of interception calling for more U-boats for combing Atlantic wastes.Little did he know at that time that break into the German naval cipher helped Allies to outwit U-boat command.Ultra was closely guarded secret of World War II.Its revelation has led to a re-appraisal of Battle of Atlantic.<br /><br />For a long time after the war Germans believed allied use of short wave ASV radar,HF-DF betrayed U-boat positions.Afterword at the end of the book by German naval historian Jurgen Rohwer has given a fresh perspective on the campaign.By mid-1943 the U-boat offensive was in ruins defeated by a combination of special intelligence,HF-DF ,ASV radar,escort carriers,superior escorting techniques and improved depth charges.Here lay ,I believe, Doenitz failure as a commander.<br /><br />According to his biographer Peter Padfield,he saw only his goals;ignored obstacles probable reaction of others.Though Doenitz speaks about new U-boats-TypeXXI,XXIII,Walter-they never appeared on time in sufficent numbers to influence the outcome of the struggle.<br /><br />Other topics of interest in this book:Doenitz indictment of Prize regulations,torpedo failures which plagued the Norway campaign,German version of Laconia tragedy,his interaction with the top leaders of Nazi Reich.Finally this was a book which I wanted to read desperately.For many months it featured in my Amazon.com wish list.on of special intelligence,HF-DF ,ASV radar,escort carriers,superior escorting techniques and improved depth charges.Here lay ,I believe, Doenitz failure as a commander.

This brought about different modes of engagement.Ships came to fire broadsides.The admirals experimented with different forms of manoeuvre which helped to bring fire on the enemy line better.The Royal Navy deployed ships in 'line ahead' formation alongside the opposing fleet engaging the enemy downwind.However  in Trafalgar it adopted a new manoeuvre 'breaking the line'French ships were enveloped and enfiladed from the wings.Experiences of men who saw combat in the seas have been documented.Equal stress has also been given on the impact of technology on naval warfare.The supersession of woodenship by ironclad and sail by steam transformed the nature of war at sea.Arm oured protection enhanced the seaworthiness of ships ,steam propulsion increased its speed.Outcome of battles now determined by the accuracy of long -range gunnery.With the coming of aircraft and submarine war at sea became complex and multidimensional.Naval actions can now be staged on surface ,air and subsurface.Hitherto aeroplane aboard ships have been used for scouting purposes , for directing gun fire.But a combination of bomb and torpedo made aircraft a lethal weapon.A new generation of naval leaders realised that planes operating from flight decks can be used for projecting fire power across vast ocean spaces.This idea made the 'big gun' philosophy obselete.Another powerful weapon , the submarine which can be used to deny the freedom of navigation in highseas posing a threat to the security of maritime nations.Both world wars the German U boats brought the Allied navies almost to the brink of defeat. In the final chapter Keegan predicts future prospects of war at sea.Seas will be devoid of capital ships and submarines would become the instruments of sea control.Using stealth , manoeuvrability,high underwater speed ; launching torpedoes and missiles from great depths it can whittle down the strengh of carrier battlegroups.Finally I may add,with spy satellites hanging overhead, keeping round- the- clock vigil, a pearl harbor type ambush is virtally ruled out.r scouting purposes , for directing gun fire.But a combination of bomb and torpedo made aircraft a lethal weapon.A new generation of naval leaders realised that planes operating from flight decks can be used for projecting fire power across vast ocean spaces.This idea made the 'big gun' philosophy obselete.Another powerful weapon , the submarine which can be used to deny the freedom of navigation in highseas posing a threat to the security of maritime nations.Both world wars the German U boats brought the Allied navies almost to the brink of defeat.

Thus came polyalphabetic ciphers and homonyms.<br /><br />A reader of this book will find how successful penetration of ciphers had a profound impact on the course of history.Among incidents narrated - to mention a few -assassination of Mary queen of scots, Zimmermann Telegram ,cracking of Nazi Enigma ciphers by British cryptanalysts working at GCCS at Bletchley Park considerably shortend the duration of Second World War.There is a excellent account of German Enigma machine cipher.<br /><br />The operation of Enigma, given by other authors , has always baffled me.But after reading author's version I could understand its intricacies better.Few pages in the book have been devoted to how code breaking has enriched our knowledge of the past.Decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics by French linguist Champollion and cracking of Minoan Linear B by Michael Ventris .<br /><br />In the concluding chapters of the book author dwelts upon complexties of computer encryption especially how cryptologists were able to overcome 'key exchange problem . Each encryption has something called algorithm or key which specifies the meathod for encrypting the message.In electronic encipherment conventional ways of exchanging keys would have caused immense logistical problems.But thanks to enthusiasm and perseverance shown by a group of American engineers the problem was solved which again shows that human ingenuity knows no bounds.In our internet age encryption assumes prime importance as this could only ensure the safety of e-commerce transactions.<br /><br />Finally, Mr Singh has prophesied the shape of things to come.Quantum cryptography which I found trifle difficult to understand.Author says quantum encryption is virtually impervious to hackers.So he ends the book in an optimistic note.Author deserves felicitations as he endeavoured to make abstruse subject as simple as possible.The book is a sheer delight to read .However reader wanting to draw more information on the subject must turn to David Kahn's monumental Code Breakers or his recently published voluminous tome History of Secret Writing.ne cipher.

We came to know that Allies read German Enigma ciphers with the publication of F.W.Winterbotham's book Ultra Secret.This made it indispensible for the historians to re-interpret the History of world war Two , particularly Battle of Atlantic.<br /><br />Undoubtedly Ultra was the biggest secret of World War Two. Some portions of the book is very technical. I feel the reader not having scientific , mathematical background may have to peruse it couple of times before he could hope to understand complexties of the German enigma machine cipher narrated in the book.<br /><br />Be that may ,benefitting from the experience of World war One the Kriegsmarine took extraordinary precautions to make its crypto systems foolproof.Communications formed the core of Admiral Doenitz's U-boat wolf-pack warfare.An U-boat after spotting a convoy shadowed its quarry calling other U-boats to the scene.Movements of several U-boats towards the scene were controlledby U-boat HQs at Lorient at the Biscay coast.Attack commenced only when the converging U-boats had formed a pack.This strategy of co-ordinated attack can succeed only if Kriegsmarine had access to secure communications.The German naval Enigma provided such communication.<br /><br />Unlike Germany's other military ciphers[Army, Airforce]the naval version defied cryptanalysis for a long time.why? Unlike the standard Army Enigma[which had a choice of 3 scramblers out of possible 5]the naval Enigma had 4 scramblers out of possible 8.This increased the number of scrambler arrangements 6 times,correspondingly increasing the number of scrambler substitutions for a cryptanalyst to check.The other difference concerned the reflector responsible for returning the signal through scramblers.Standard Enigma reflector was fixed in one particular orientation but naval enigma reflector can be fixed at any one of the particular orientations.This increased the number of possible keys by a factor of 26.<br /><br />In short extra scramblers,variable reflector new systems of exchanging message keys,non-stereotypical messages combined to make German naval communications impenetrable.Naval Enigma had pseudonyms Hydra,Triton.<br />Where ever intellectual endeavour fails to obtain keys other measures had to be resorted to:theft,espionage.Combination of technical wizardry ,shrewd guess work,lucky breaks[pinching navalEnigma scramblers, cipher materials from seized German trawlers,weatherships,U-boats]the British were able to make inroads into the U-boat communications.<br /><br />Their labour further simplified by some careless mistakes made by German Enigma operators.The book is replete with technical jargons such as Hernivel, Tip,Crib.All of them represented different meathods conceived by British to narrow down the number of possibilities to be tested for determining the correct scrambler settings.<br /><br />Reader will find in this book personal profiles of Britain's leading codebreakers.Polish contribution in the struggle to break Enigma has also not been ignored by the author.<br /><br />Cracking U-boat codes helped mitigate disastrous shipping losses as the Allied navies were able to determine the patrol lines formed by U-boats.Bylate 1943 more and more convoys were steered away from the waiting U-boat packs.<br /><br />Besides cutting shipping losses Enigma decrypts also served as a force multiplier.Ultra guided escort carriers and hunter-killer groups towards U-boats instead of having to search for them over a large area.<br /><br />It sounds ironical,Kahn after writing a fine book,in the final count,has belittled the the role of Ultra in the Battle of Atlantic.Kahn says Ultra or not the Allies were bound to win.However I disagree with author's optimism in this regard.If the German naval Enigma had not been cracked the number of U-boats would have multiplied.By this time new Electro boats would have come into action.Type XXI class was a full-fledged submarine,had snorkels coated with radar absorbing material,torpedoes that zig-zagged ,guided to the targets helped by soundplots without exposing their periscopes.Then boats stealthily moved away from the scene of action running on silent motors making it difficult for hydrophones to detect.The outcome of this form of struggle hard to predict.<br /><br />Besides a new naval Enigma was about to enter service when war came to close.Allies obtained technical details of new German submarine after decrypting messages sent to Tokyo by the japanese naval attache in Berlin.<br /><br />Finally, another statement I find difficult to concur with  is what Kahn calls as functional attributes of intelligence:A country defending its freedom is only in need of good intelligence.I wish to modify it by saying that a country embarking on a war with its neighbours also is in need of good intelligence.<br /><br />Former must know the strengh and weakness of opponent's armed forces,psychological profile of latter's militaryleadership,terrain,weapons and doctrine guiding its employment,number of reserves at  its disposal.For instance Hitler and his Generals seriously underestimated Red Army ,especially the number of divisions it could bring from the hinterland.<br /><br />RedArmy had immense reserves totalling 200-300 divisions.It frustrated,though at a great cost, the German drive to capture Moscow.<br /><br />Let us recall what the great Chinese military thinker SunTzu said centuries ago\\"Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight hundred battles without defeat\\".oes that zig-zagged ,guided to the targets helped by soundplots without exposing their periscopes.Then boats stealthily moved away from the scene of action running on silent motors making it difficult for hydrophones to detect.The outcome of this form of struggle hard to predict.

US	52708907	RAG56FWN1R0PZ	0700608990	535506720	When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler (Modern War Studies)	Books	5	10	13	N	Y	Superb narration of Soviet-German war	Most of the information contained in this book,furnished by authors Glantz House,I find fair,accurate,impartial,objective.<br /><br />Firstly,the argument that Red Army contemplated pre-emptive strike to derail German plans to invade Soviet Union,as alleged by some historians in the West is a mistaken notion.Though Soviets were pioneers in mobile warfare by the 1930s technical edge was squandered.Purge of the Red Army General Staff along with the wrong lessons learned during Spanish Civil war caused regression in Soviet mechanised force structures and operational concepts.With the result when Nazi Germany invaded Soviet Union,as authors have shown, on June 22,1941, the Red Army was woefully unprepared to meet the challenge.<br /><br />Hitler strove to conquer Soviet Union in the summer of 1941 in a rapier -like thrust.But he failed and the German doctrine of lightning war Blitzkrieg lay discredited on the approaches to Moscow.It is worth recalling that momentum in German advance after the Battle of Smolensk[10 july-10 sep1941] along the Moscow axis slowed down considerably.<br /><br />Rokossovsky's16th army of Marshal S.M. Budenny's Reserve front managed to parry thrusts delivered by Hoth's Third panzer group to force Dneipr at Iartsevo.However in my view the reasons for German failure go much deep.The one cause being failure of German intelligence which lacked  accurate knowledge about number of  divisions at the disposal of the Red Army especially  reserves which can be brought from the depths of Russia.In other words they grossly underestimated Soviet military strength. . I endorse the explanation given by the authors:Red Army's ability to field new divisions as soon as Wehrmacht smashed existing units exhausted German war machine.At times 'quantity generates its own quality'<br /><br />As David Kahn has said in his masterly analysis of Hitler's Intelligence the Germans were conceited,arrogant,overconfident,tend to downgrade their opponents.I am also of the view the Soviet campaign was beyond the scope Wehrmacht which was designed to deliver shock attacks along a limited periphery.Distances to be covered in that country were immense,follow-on forces being minimal,adding strain to precarious German logistics which wore down the much-vaunted panzers.<br /><br />Sections in the book about evolution Soviet Military Doctrine governing the use of armoured-mechanised forces was very enlightening.By 1943 the Red Army was qualitatively better off.  Its performance benifitted by the flow of equipment from factories located east of Ural mountains and also from the Western Allies.Quality of artillery improved especially rocket-artillery,fielded superior quality tanks:T-34s,KV-1s.Skill of its commanders improved.Apart from perfecting the art of breaching deep German defences they stroved to ensure  that tank forces pursued objectives located far behind enemy fronts.<br /><br />Most of the Soviet offensives were preceded by holding attacks,deceptions which fostered a delusion among the Germans they were overwhelmed by a Red Tidal wave.This was the case with Stalingrad counter-offensive[19 Nov 1942];Kursk counter-offensive[12 July 1943] Operation Bagration [22 June 1944].<br /><br /> However I beg to differ with the authors on their interpretation  of Operation Case Blue.Glantz ,House have credited Germans for deceiving Soviets about its strategic intentions,made latter think that on summer of  1942 German  thrust would come again along the Moscow axis.We now know thanks Soviet spy networks[Red Orchestra]STAVKA knew the scope and direction of the proposed German summer offensive.This helped it to frame a appropriate strategy to counter the German assault.Von Paulus 6th army steadily inexorably was drawn into the jaws of an enormous steel trap which snapped shut at Stalingrad.<br /><br />Again Soviet foreknowledge  of German intention thanks to Lucy network in Switzerland helped Red Army during the summer of 1943 to blunt German drive to pinch out Kursk salient.The authors have ignored the contribution of Red Orchestra which cost Germany war in the East.This being the only lacuna of this book.<br /><br />Soviet Union bore brunt of the war against NaziGermany.Soviet-German war was the biggest land conflict in the history of warfare.Any military buff who ignores it ,according to me, is not a serious a student of war.For a long time cold war rivalry between the super powers prevented a objective appraisal of events. This path-breaking book will go a long way in redressing deficiencies of earlier works on the subject which gave partial and prejudiced view of things.ibution of Red Orchestra which cost Germany war in the East.This being the only lacuna of this book.

The book opens with a botched Abwehr attempt to plant agents in America. Kahn's penetrating insights on intelligence (Chaper 2:Protozoa, Speech and History )  I found very interesting. Here the author expatiates on  the  scope, nature of the subject and its application in war.<br /><br />As Kahn rightly  says though intelligence has a long pedigree till World War 1 it made  little impact.The onset of  Industrial Revolution effected  a profound  change in social dynamics which catapulted it to the forefront .The  creation of  railways, telegraphs, newspapers, good maps furnished it with  tools that helped to gain more knowledge of enemy country .<br /><br />Exception to  this thesis is the Battle of Metaurus 207 BC. Here the Romans were able to  intercept a message indicating the arrival of a Carthaginian army in  Italia to reinforce  Hannibal.As a result Roman legions  under Claudius  Nero could defeat Hasdrubal's army before he was  able to effect junction  with his brother's forces.<br /><br /> Kahn  groups intelligence into two categories:  Physical and Verbal.The former includes photographs of enemy troop concentrations,fortifications; latter, stolen enemy plans ,intercepted  orders. Verbal is definitely superior because former confirms enemy  intentions while latter predicts them.<br /><br />The German Intelligence during World  War 11 notched up a number of operational successes.The  most remarkable  among them being the breaking of  ciphers used by the US Military Attache  in Cairo Col. Bonner Fellers. Tactical intelligence that poured from the  decryption of codes helped  Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's assault on British  8th Army which took Afrika Korps to the gates of Alexandria.The  Cryptoanalytic branch of the German Navy B-Dienst penetrated British  Admiralty's manual  ciphers directing convoy traffic. This helped the  U-boat  Command to accurately plot the course the convoys would take which  led to awesome shipping losses.<br /><br />But on the whole Hitler's intelligence  failed miserably. Consider the following examples.<br /><br />1) It failed to  provide accurate picture of strength of Red Army. The fact that  STAVKA(Soviet General  Staff)  had immense reserves at its disposal across  the river Dneiper; OKH(German Army High Command)knew  nothing of this .One  reason that Hitler's blitzkrieg failed in Soviet Russia was due to these  strategic reserves which absorbed the shock of German attacks.<br /><br /> 2)Foreign  Armies East (Fremde Heere Ost) of Col. Reinhard Gehlen ,the intelligence  branch of OKH ,failed in detecting scope and direction of Red Army's attack which encircled General Von  Paulus 6th Army at Stalingrad.So too was the case with  'Operation  Bagration', the assault on Army Group Centre which opened on June 22,1944.  STAVKA masked direction of its thrusts through deceptions,ruses .<br /><br /> 3)German  intelligence failed to anticipate Allied landings in North Africa on  Nov.8,1942(Operation Torch ).<br /><br />4)It considered - thanks to Allied  deception(BODY GUARD)- Normandy landings on June,6,1944 as feint.  5)Superior Allied camouflage measures  prevented German counter-  intelligence  from knowing that their Army ,Navy ,Airforce codes  were  intercepted, decrypted and read.<br /><br />Why did German intelligence  fail? Virulent anti-semistism practised by the Nazis ,according to Kahn, led to collosal brain  drain,scores of Jewish scientists  migrated. Their presence perhaps during  war could have made lot of difference particularly in the ensuing  \\"battle of wits\\".<br /><br />Traditional German arrogance bred by sense of  superiority distorted their perception of reality, made them to  underestimate adversaries which in the end proved fatal.Intelligence was  considered a functional attribute of defence.Defence reacts , offense acts  .German Reich  under  Hitler sought to impose its will on its  neighbours.Hence the need for intelligence never arose.Besides  some of the  senior officers of the General Staff thought that it was difficult to know  intentions, plans of the enemy.Only by vigorous  actions by commanders in  the field could that be ascertained.<br /><br /> Finally even if best intelligence, had  it been proffered (CICERO affair),would not have made any difference.  German leader's megalomania ,preconceptions stemming from his warped mind  was bound to diminish its value.<br /><br />Kahn's  masterly study of German  Intelligence in World War 11 must be rated as a great book on the subject.  Though I have read another work on the same theme-Farago's Game of the  Foxes-Kahn's book is definitely superior.Though verbose, it is erudite and  analytical .<br /><br />I laid my hands on this book quite inadvertently .One day  visiting Trivandrum, I happened to browse the University Library .

Things were hotting up for the Russians .After the Mukden  incident in September 1931,the Japanese army invaded Manchuria and the  buffer zone which shielded Soviet Far East  ceased to exist.Now Kwantung  Army stood at its very door step.<br /><br /> In Germany Hitler had come to  power.Germany and Japan were trying to forge closer ties which could lead  to an encircling alliance. Hence Sorge was told to penetrate the German  Embassy by his Soviet masters.  For this purpose he started perfecting  a  journalistic cover .Took up the job of Tokyo correspondent of German paper  Frankfurter Zeitung and also got a  accredition to the German Embassy in  Tokyo. Then reinforced his bonafides by taking Nazi party membership.<br /><br /> In  Tokyo Sorge befriended Col.Eugen Ott the German military attache who later  became the ambassador and won his trust .Soon Ott started passing  confidential information to his friend.After the outbreak of war in Europe  in September 1939 Sorge worked in the Press section of the Embassy.  GRU  now had eyes in the Nazi citadel and access to information of crucial  importance to Soviet strategic planning.Sorge's bonhomie with the German  Embassy officials in Tokyo helped him to know Hitlers's biggest secret:Nazi  Gernany was planning to invade Soviet Union.The information was first  brought to his notice by Lt.Col. Erwin Scholl who succeded  Ott  to the  post of Military Attache. This report was later confirmed by Ambassador  Ott, Sorge promptly informed his Soviet masters.<br /><br />But Stalin contemptously  brushed aside this report and later paid a heavy price for doing so.Another  important  contact that Sorge cultivated in Japan was Ozaki Hotsumi with  whom he became friendly at Shanghai . Hotsumi , a journalist working  for  Japanese daily Asahi ,had many contacts in  Nipponese Government  circles.With the help of this wily Japanese ,Sorge informed Moscow of how  Germany and Japan were co-ordinating their policies . On 27 September 1940  Japan signed Tripartite Pact, joined Rome -Berlin Axis.The pact designed to  ensure mutual security of Axis powers ;however,Germany had other designs.<br /><br />  Berlin wanted to harness Tokyo in its global strategy to contain her  adversaries. Soviet Union had a cause for concern. On June 22 ,1941,Hitler  launched Operation Barbarossa,the invasion of Soviet Union.Immediately the  Nazi Foreign Minister Hans Joachim Ribbentrop started putting pressure on  Tokyo. He wanted Japan to renounce its neutrality pact with Russsia and  fall on her rear.<br /><br />It was now that Sorge scored the biggest intelligence  triumphs of his career. Sorge through his Japanese contact Hotsumi  endeavoured to find out for his Soviet masters how Japan would react to  this proposal.Tokyo procrastinated adopted a policy of cautious  opportunism. Besides  relations with Western powers deteriorated when US  imposed an oil embargo on August 1  1941.Attempts to resolve the  dispute through  diplomatic means failed.Konoye Government resigned and  war party under Hideki Tojo assumed power October 16,1941.This made war  with US certain.<br /><br />The Soviet Far East for a while would be safe from the  depredations of Kwantung Army.By mid-October 1941,Sorge's radioman tapped  out in Morse code to Moscow of these political developments  which had a  profound historical impact.

US	52708907	R2U9Z5A2OXNL7N	0306806045	371726561	The Luftwaffe War Diaries: The German Air Force in World War II (Reprint)	Books	4	27	33	N	Y	An absorbing account of luftwaffe's triumph and tragedy	The author expatiates on operations of German airforce in different theatres of war -Poland ,Norway ,France and Low countries  ,Balkans ,Russia- when Hitlers's conquest was at its height .<br /><br />The principal  credit for making \\"Blitzkrieg'  a success must go to Luftwaffe. Its  support of ground forces -direct ,indirect -brought the Polish campaign to  a swift conclusion .Later it helped the German armour to breach French  defences at Sedan on May 13,1940.Allied airforces intervened ,made a  desperate attempt  to block Guderian's tanks from crossing river Meuse  which was repulsed by the Luftwaffe fighters.Once the breakthrough was  effected, panzers rattled and rumbled towards  the English channel.  In the  process they outran infantry cover, consequently the Luftwaffe was assigned  the task of protecting vulnerable flanks of armoured thrust which it did  brilliantly.<br /><br />On May 21-22 ,1941 ,Royal Navy in Cretan waters was exposed to  the full fury of German airforce.This led to the first air-sea battle in  the history of war .After suffering crippling losses the English fleet had  to retreat having paid the penalty of operating without aircover.<br /><br />Luftwaffe  was largely responsible for the triumphant German advance upto the gates of  Moscow.<br /><br /> The book has exploded  a few myths. The strength of German airforce  during the beginning of  hostilities was grossly exaggerated by  Anglo-American historians of the war.During German invasion of Poland,  Luftwaffe had at its disposal only 1302 first-line aircraft. Anglo-Saxon  media has reviled the German bombing of  Warsaw,Rotterdam. The author  ,however, has given different interpretation on what caused this unfortunate bombing,.Both cities were barricaded and bitterly defended. Repeated  attempts to make them surrender through negotiations failed.<br /><br /> The book has a  few drawbacks. The section dealing with ' Battle of Britain ' appears  outdated. Ever since the publication of Group Captain F.W.Winterbotham's  book 'Ultra Secret\\" officially-recognized version on History of World War sorely  needed  re-interpretation . But the author can be absolved  of this lapse since he  wrote the book at a time when Ultra was still a top  secret.Author never  had  the privilege to know that Luffwaffe ciphers had been broken and its  operational orders read by the British intelligence.<br /><br />Also ignored are  developments in the field of electronics .Just as  the Battle of Atlantic,  technical progress made a deep impact on the fortunes of airwar.Germans had  radars  like Freya, Wurzburg to detect the approach of Allied bomber  formations.British countered  by deploying jammers (Mandrel,Carpet) on fighter  planes escorting bomber formations helping them to penetrate German  airspace, Then there were devices like Liechtenstein SN2,RWR(radar warning  receiver) called Naxos, The former was an airborne interception radar,  Latter a passive device capable of sensing radar emisssions from Allied  bombers which were picked up at double the  distance at which bombers  radars were able to detect German fighters. This gave fighters ample time  to plan manoeuvres . Naxos picked up emisssions from H2's radar installed  on RAF pathfinder force ( PFF) which were assigned the task of marking  targets to be bombed  by dropping phosphorous flares.Naxos guided the  fighters directly to this aircraft.The second German RWR  was Flensburg  which received  emissions from British  airborne radar Monica fitted  on to  the tail of RAF bombers.Thanks to progress in the field of electronics  total destruction of Berlin in the spring of 1944 was averted.<br /><br />Upon  reading the book I had a feeling that Herr Bekker wrote it with the  intention of extolling the achievments of Luftwaffe. No doubt Germans had  superior planes at their disposal. Till the advent of American P-51 Mustang  fighters Luftwaffe's FW-190 was the best air superiority fighter.This was  amply demonstratedduring the dog fights with the British Spitfires in  1941,42,43 above the English channel. Much before the outbreak  of war  Germans had experimented  rocket,turbo-jet powered  planes  (HE-176,HE-178) However the lead was not exploited and the advantage  squandered due to myopia of Luftwaffe General Staff.<br /><br />Reason for the decline  of  Luftwaffe is not difficult to seek. Being predominantly tactical  airforce whose mission was to support the army in its blitz campaigns, it  lacked strategic offensive and operational level defensive capabilities.  Conceived for short-term campaigns the changing nature of war forced  Luftwaffe to embark on number of tasks and its  weakness was soon exposed  .The belief that Germany  had won the war led to curtailment in long-term  planning and development.As a result the airforce was saddled with obsolete  aircraft.<br /><br />Finally, Hitler's insistence on offensive air operation meant that  the potentialities of Germany's first operational jet fighter (ME-262)  could not be fully exploited.in  1941,42,43 above the English channel.

Reads like a fast-paced thriller .<br /><br />The book tells the story of the biggest intelligence -gathering operation in the history of espionage .<br /><br />On June 22 ,1941, Hitler launched the  invasion of Soviet Union .The attack code- named \\"Barbarossa \\"  led to the biggest land campaign in the history of war .Eastern campaign  was four days old ,panzers smashing their way through forward Soviet  defences ,when German long -range radio monitoring stations at Kranz on the  Baltic coast of East Prussia intercepted cryptic messages beamed by  clandestine radio transmitters.<br /><br />Signal intelligence squads of Funkabwehr immediately swung  into action. Using director- finder sets took cross bearings of these  transmissions ,established that directional lines traversed Brussels ,Paris  ,Lucerne and even Berlin itself .From the nature of these transmissions  German intelligence admitted that this was the work of Soviet spyring in  Reich and occupied territories ,recipient of enciphered messages was housed  in Moscow.<br /><br />Welcome to Red Orchestra .Though created by the GRU( Soviet  Military Intelligence ) it included in its ranks people of several  nationalities ,coming from different walks of life ,having diverse  political persuasions ,but all united in their hatred for Nazi regime. Red  Orchestra network of spies ,agents ,informers frustrated Hitler's<br />bid to conquer Russia.<br /><br />Soviet spy  apparat (network) in Berlin while transmitting information used call signs  \\"Choro \\" , \\"Wolf \\" .After much dedicated and laborious  detective work the cryptoanalysts of \\"Funkabwehr \\" uncovered  their identies .\\"Choro \\"was Lieutenant Harro Schulze -Boysen, a  Luftwaffe desk officer in the Reich Ministry of Aviation .This allowed him  to access highly sensitive information .\\"Wolf \\"turned out to be  Dr . Arvid Harnack ,a senior Civil servant in the Reich Ministry of  Economics .Being members of Berlin high society they brushed shoulders with  highest ranking officers of German High Command and Nazi party.<br /><br />Another  important cog of GRU spy network was Grand Chef's circuit,which operated  from Belgium ,Holland ,France .But who was Grand Chef ? He was Leopold  Trepper alias Adam Mikler ,Jean Gilbert , a Polish Jew.Recruited into the  GRU,he went to Belgium .There he opened a commercial enterprise as a cover  for his clandestine activities .His firms Simex ,Simexco -after the German  Occupation of western Europe -did lucrative business with Todt organisation  which supervised works of construction and fortification for  \\"Wehrmacht\\" .Money generated from the business was used by Grand  Chef to further expand activities of the network .As the author  aptly puts  it \\" Third Reich was subsidising the Red Orchestra just as a living  organism will nourish the cancer that is eroding it \\"<br /><br />It was during  the course of such interactions Trepper's agents heard Hitler's  preparations to invade Russia.However the most important  source of intelligence for GRU proved to be \\"LUCY\\".LUCY worked for Soviet<br />Soviet intelligence which operated from neutral country Switzerland .The  network dubbed \\"DIE ROTE DREI\\"(The Red Three) was erected by GRU  agent ,a Hungarian map maker Sandor Rado ,whose call name was DORA.<br /><br />LUCY was  Rudolf Rossler, a German refugee publisher living in Lucerne,Harsh  treatment meted out by Alfred Rosenberg who seized his profitable theatre  company made him a rabid anti-nazi.Rossler alias LUCY ,whose identity was  to remain secret long after the war had ended ,received information from  sources in German High Command (OKW).The post war CIA study had partially  unmasked their identities .The most important among them were Lt.Gen Fritz  Thiele,second -in-command of OKW's communications branch and Baron Rudolf  Von Gersdorff chief of intelligence on the staff of Army Group Centre on  theEastern Front.<br /><br />Thus through LUCY the GRU penetrated German General Staff  .Scarcely tenhours passed between taking of a decision by OKW and its  receipt in Moscow which means the decision was known to STAVKA(Soviet High  Command)even before it came to the notice of German field commanders.<br />This  was intelligence windfall of the first order which had no parallels anytime  in history.<br /><br />The operation of Soviet spy networks helped Red  Army to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat .War began disastrously for  the Russians .If only Stalin had heeded to the warnings of Red Orchestra of  about impending German attack ,Wehrmacht could have been stopped on its  tracks.<br /><br />The book contains some startling revelations .This pertains to  Operation Case Blue launched on June 28,1942 by Wehrmacht .Mr .Tarrant has  debunked the claim of leading historians of the war on Eastern Front who  said Stalin again ignored intelligence warnings and was responsible for the  destruction of South -Western front with the enemy reaching the banks of  Volga at Stalingrad.<br /><br />Author has shown that Stavka was aware of German  intentions thanks to Red Orchestra .Entire ten pages of Hitler\\"s  Directive No:41 setting out the strategic intentions of summer offensive was  transmitted to Moscow thanks to Lucy.This enabled  Stalin and his generals to devise a strategy where by Germans were lured  deep into the Soviet territory .In military parlance this is know as  elastic or mobile defence.Red Army retreated,shirked contact with the enemy,surrendering vast swathes of land in the process.Author says Germans where drawn into the jaws of enormous steel trap which snapped shut in Stalngrad.<br /><br />Knowledge bestows power  and intelligence represents highest form of knowledge .Soviet foreknowledge again of German intentions helped Red Army to parry enemy blows .This was  precisely what happened during Operation Citadel .Thanks again to LUCY, Red  Army was able to blunt the German drive to pinch out the Kursk Bulge .<br /><br />Some  what strange it looks,Soviet histriography of war has virtually ignored  the contribution of Red Orchestra in that country's victory over Nazi  Germany .On the contrary author under the chapter ,\\"Ultra Myth \\"  has reproached attempts made by some historians in the West to belittle its  role.<br /><br />By the end of 1943, Red Orchestra networks were all dead ,snuffed out  in a massive counter -intelligence operation launched by Abwehr and  Gestapo.LUCY's sources too perished due to purge unleashed by Nazi regime  against senior Commanders of German Officer Corps for their attempt to  assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944.However by this time the tide of war on  theSoviet front had changed ,Red Army began its inexorable advance towards  Berlin .<br /><br />Based on solid ,painstaking research ,this book I  rate the  book best read in recent times Author has shed new light on the war in  the Eastern Front ignored by historians in the West for which he needs to  be felicitated .Now it appears the history of Soviet-German war needs  revision ,reinterpretation.which means the decision was known to STAVKA(Soviet High  Command)even before it came to the notice of German field commanders.  This  was intelligence windfall of the first order which had no parallels anytime  in history.                   The operation of Soviet spy networks helped Red  Army to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat .War began disastrously for  the Russians .If only Stalin had heeded to the warnings of Red Orchestra of  about impending German attack ,Wehrmacht could have been stopped on its  tracks.     The book contains some startling revelations .This pertains to  Operation Case Blue launched on June 28,1942 by Wehrmacht .Mr .Tarrant has  debunked the claim of leading historians of the war on Eastern Front who  said Stalin again ignored intelligence warnings and was responsible for the  destruction of South -Western front with the enemy reaching the banks of  Volga at Stalingrad.    Author has shown that Stavka was aware of German  intentions thanks to Red Orchestra .Entire ten pages of Hitler\\"s  Directive No:41 setting out the strategic intentions of summer offensive was  transmitted to Moscow thanks to Lucy.This enabled  Stalin and his generals to devise a strategy where by Germans were lured  deep into the Soviet territory .In military parlance this is know as  elastic or mobile defence.Red Army retreated,shirked contact with the enemy,surrendering vast swathes of land in the process.Author says Germans where drawn into the jaws of enormous steel trap which snapped shut in Stalngrad.

Some  what strange it looks,Soviet histriography of war has virtually ignored  the contribution of Red Orchestra in that country's victory over Nazi  Germany .On the contrary author under the chapter ,\\"Ultra Myth \\"  has reproached attempts made by some historians in the West to belittle its  role.
