This ends up being a disaster, this is the writers first trip to the West, her history, and knowlegde of the West is zero. She spent her childhood school years just memorizing the Koran. Despite her degrees in history, her history of the West is very poor. When introduced to the writngs of Kant, she assumes that he is still a role model on the philosophy of women in the western world.<br />The saddest part is when she writes about her collegue Kemal, no matter how much he abuses her verbally, she always crawls back for his approval, while trying to tell us how liberated she is.<br />I feel sorry for all her fears, and she has many, having crossed roads, that thank god, I didn't have to cross.<br />So give this book a skip, hopefully the author made enough money on it to travel a bit more and read alot more before she writes another book about the West	2004-03-01
