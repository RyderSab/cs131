Roy Moseley was introduced to the world of Bette Davis movies via his mother - who was a fan - as a boy and grew to admire her so much that he made it a point to know her personally - a feat he accomplished!<br />There are various anecdotes in the book which are refreshing, surprising and funny: seems Bette was a most contradictory woman who could be extremely unpredictable: honest, caring and lovable one minute and harsh, cynical and monstrous the next. Apparently, like most great stars, geniuses, etc., she was quite insecure and a walking paradox who was fascinating but exhausting to be around!<br />The book is a valuable read for fans (and there are many) of this great First Lady of the Silver Screen because it reveals the real woman behind the legend. As I have long suspected, Moseley pointedly states that many things Davis said in print about her life were totally worthless as historical facts biograpy-wise, because she tended (as many stars of her era did) to romanticize/whitewash her personal life to the point of rendering it rather dull. And dull definitely is not an adjective one would use to describe this brilliant woman!	2003-11-20

Although she wasn't exactly my favorite actress (her grating Bryn Mawr accent and rather unversatile personality didn't enchant me in the movies as a rule) Hepburn was a gutsy, independent woman - who's real-life personality I actually admired (as I would assume many people did) more than her movie star personna. <br />I have to admit that certain things about Hepburn were very admirable: her loyalty to her family, her Yankee-bred way of living, her self-discipline and sometimes eccentrically delightful behaviour was fun to read about. The segment in which Michael Jackson came to visit was fascinating: funny and strangely thought-provoking. Seems Jackson had a yen for meeting the reclusive Greta Garbo and wanted Kate to set up an appointment. \\"Absolutely not, Michael\\" was her firmly polite reply. When author Scott A. Berg caught Kate rummaging thru his overnight bag in his guestroom he amusingly inquired \\"Find anything interesting\\"? - red-faced, Kate replied meekly \\"Not a God-****** thing!\\" She was \\"real people\\" after all!	2003-08-05

Easily my favourite big band of the fabled Swing Era, I thought Artie's clarinet had a woodsy tone which was prettier than Goodman's (although Benny was undoubtedly the better clarinetist) and felt that his band sounded more swinging and modern than Goodman's. Shaw's 1938 band (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;) was fantastic as was his equally famous 31 piece 194O band (&quot;Frenesi&quot;). His 1941 Orchestra gave us the lush classic versions of &quot;Star Dust&quot;, &quot;Moonglow&quot; &amp; &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; Classy and unforgettable records, those three sides! <br />Born in NYC 23 May, 191O, Arthur Issac Arshawsky somehow escaped living a life of poverty via sheer will and determination to &quot;be somebody&quot;: perhaps the most innovative and creatively intellectual of all the big-time leaders, one can hear Shaw's genius in his music: his diversity, originality and creative tendencies are fascinating and astounding to hear.<br />His initial band in 1936 included strings - something which was highly unusual for a swing band. &quot;There's Frost on the Moon&quot; vocalised by Peg La Centra and &quot;Japanese Sandman&quot; are both available on CD - as good examples of his music from this period. <br />In 1939, at the height of his popularity, Shaw - who could never abide bobby-soxers &amp; autograph hounds - simply walked off the bandstand one night and fled to Mexico.  Shaw loved music and all its aspects - but LOATHED the business side of his career. But he couldn't stay away for good. Artie was back on top with another great hit he found south of the border: &quot;Frenesi&quot;.<br />This intellectual genius -  still living in Southern California - married Kathleen Winsor, who authored &quot;Forever Amber&quot;. Lana Turner was his young bride and another wife - Ava Gardner - was crazy about him. Shaw was also married to Scarlett O' Hara's younger sister - Evelyn Keyes.  Creative, frustrated, brilliant and a perfectionist, Shaw's legacy is his fabulous music - most of which is re-mastered and available to the public on CD's. Perhaps the most inspired &quot;small group&quot; of the entire Swing Era was Artie's terrific Gramercy Five.<br />My personal favourites of his records are BEGIN THE BEGUINE, MOONGLOW, STAR DUST, DANCING IN THE DARK, OCTOROON, OUT OF NOWHERE, LOVE FOR SALE, NOCTURNE, CONCERTO FOR CLARINET, TEMPTATION, COMIN' ON, BACK BAY SHUFFLE, ONE FOOT IN THE GROOVE, ONE NIGHT STAND, CHANTEZ-LES BAS, FRENESI, SUMMIT RIDGE DRIVE, BLUES IN THE NIGHT, THE MAID WITH THE FLACCID AIR, SEPTEMBER SONG, BETWEEN A KISS AND A SIGH...among many others.	2003-04-02

Being an enthusiastic amateur treasure hunter myself, in years past, I diligently read each and every volume of Mr. Terry's exhaustively researched works. Although I found some the information erroneous or far from exact - for instance many locations cited as \\"ghost towns\\" are FAR from being one - there are so many intriguing stories of legends, factual evidence & stories of past recoveries that any true TH'r will be enthralled. Treasure hunting is supposedly America's fastest growing hobby: it's uniquely enjoyable for the adventure, historical aspects & healthy outdoor recreation. And when you really find something decent...Boy Howdy!! Not as easy as it sounds, though. To be a professional TH'r, one has to have patience, applying oneself with the perseverance of a detective: because that's what it takes to be successful. Exhaustive research is the key: going where people gathered long ago (old picnic grounds & abandoned schoolyards, for instance) will be beneficial for coin shooters who are after more than modern coins....for me, finding modern coins was a complete waste of time & energy. Going for the gold? Go where it is KNOWN to be & be creative: the better your equipment - i.e. a decent detector which finds gold & common sense makes this a most fascinating hobby. For some, it's a life's career. Good luck!!	2003-02-27

In this exhaustively researched, beautifully illustrated book, author Vieira does an exceptional job. Recently, I have been drawn to the fascinating world of Pre-Code Cinema. There were some really realistically seedy, controversial and revealing films made in the Hollywood of the late twenties and early thirties. Many films which have been previously believed lost or destroyed have been rescued for the public to enjoy once more on either video or TCM. Hot stuff for the depression era! Fascinating films of the era include: THE STORY OF TEMPLE DRAKE which starred the unique Miriam Hopkins. In this one, she plays the title character who is lured into the underworld, gets raped - and finds she likes it (!). Even sweetly saccharine Loretta Young had a dark-side: check out MIDNIGHT MARY. What I find ironic is that to many people, many vintage films are considered too pretty or unrealistic.  This book proves otherwise!! A thoroughly fascinating venture into a little-known side of Hollywood which existed a scant half-dozen years: the era of Pre-Code talkies.  A very informative and revealing laboured work of art - and a fine resource - for fans of vintage film.	2003-01-21

As an avid fan of pre-code Hollywood films, I found this book to be an exceptionally well-written, entertaining reference source which goes into vivid, right-to-the-point details of the women who dominated American film in the fascinating pre-code talkie era which lasted until 1934. Among the many actresses who contributed their talents include: Norma Shearer, Loretta Young, Mae West, Nancy Carroll, Miriam Hopkins, Wynne Gibson, Helen Twelvetrees and MANY more. The text in the back of the book gives the reader information on pre-code films which can be either purchased on video - or watched on TCM. I wish more of these throroughly fascinating films would become available to the public on video: clearly, since they can be viewed on Cable television, many do indeed exist! Hint, hint....... P.S. For a great companion piece, read the equally well-written DANGEROUS MEN: it's about the men in pre-code Hollywood and THEIR contribution to that elusive, revealing era. Written by the same author: he does a splendid job in every respect: Again, LaSalle lists an exhaustive number of films available for the public to view on video & TCM. Hey, video people: get cracking!!! Perhaps Ted Turner owns these films and has exclusive copyright.	2003-01-21

The infamous \\"expose\\" in which the only natural daughter of screen legend Bette Davis gave the world a glimpse of just what a \\"monster\\" her mother really was. Pure, silly malarkey!!! It is VERY obvious that B.D. was indeed interested in getting HER 15 minutes of fame & getting paid handsomely for it, too (the advance alone for this book was reportedly $1OO,OOO). Is there anyone who can take this book all that seriously? Granted, Davis was an egomaniac who could be a feisty witch in her private life, but so what??? She wasn't evil incarnate like Joan Crawford was: there was a legitimate book in MOMMIE DEAREST. Although one can see B.D.'s view upon occasions, it was in horrific taste for her to publish this book at all, let alone crucifying her mother when she was still alive. Davis wasn't famed for being a Martha Stewart model of a mother - it was her superlative efforts as an actress of which the public cared about: we all knew she was feisty. That was her appeal.	2003-01-15

There seem to be certain elements in Eastern astrology which are missing in the &quot;Western&quot; version: together they seem to make a person feel more &quot;whole&quot;!  The knowledge of being an Earth Boar, for instance, has brought many insights about myself (and how I relate to others): it has given me invaluable insight into the way others perceive me.  Before, I simply thought of myself as a wild, roaming happy-go-lucky Sagittarius.  But the combo of Sag/Earth Boar is much more enlightening and satisfying (because it hits home): happy to know that I'm more grounded than I previously thought: a rather naive, fun-loving humanitarian type who sometimes eats and drinks a wee bit too much (!)

The author explains to each subject the benefits of having the &quot;spirit taking lead&quot; rather than the ego, for instance. My own personal day of birth explaination was astonishingly accurate.  A native of December 5, when ego leads, I could (and was) be likened to a chameleon-type who could appear in many different guises due to my versatility which ultimately made me spread myself &quot;too thin&quot;.  When spirit took the lead, however, I became a much more beneficial person in society: someone who has a genuine concern for others spiritual growth: a much more selfless person in general.

For years, in my youth, I sought acceptance by being a &quot;people pleaser&quot; type: I wanted to be accepted by &quot;trying too hard&quot;.  When I forgot about success &amp; popularity (as the book states) in my late twenties, it suddenly found me, as if by magic!  On a lighter note, because I am definitely an off-the-wall personality, I found life is much easier once I accepted this fact and by surrounding myself with friends who encourage/appreciate my zany/whacko way of seeing things.  By letting go of our ego, our garden of positive thoughts, i.e. our REAL SELVES come into fruitation.

This book is an especially desirable one to own for astrology buffs, because it covers two types in one package. Ingeniously, Suzanne has cleverly combined the East with the West astrology-wise: the results are sometimes striking &amp; surprising but they are always entertaining.  White's style of writing is more fun than scientific, which makes the reading experience enjoyable - for most people, anyway.  Like Theadora Lao and the late Linda Goodman, Suzanne takes the reader by the hand and guides them with humourous personal observations and episodes, therefore making the reader feel completely at ease and sometimes captivated by the sheer cheekiness of her observations: she doesn't expect us to take astrology TOO seriously.

A thoroughly engaging and moving reading experience, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my all-time favourite books.  Those kids (Jem and Scout Finch) are so funny and you just know that the town of Maycomb HAD to be modeled on a real town (it was - Monroeville, Alabama - where author Harper (Nelle) Lee grew up). A story about growing up and the social conscience which binds us all, this book takes place in the depressed year of 1932. The children's father, Atticus Finch,is a man who's morals and conscience remind one of Abraham Lincoln!  The book is written from the point of view of Jean Louise (&quot;Scout&quot;) Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who wears dungarees: she would rather roll in old tires and climb trees with her brother Jem and their friend Dill - he was based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote -  than do &quot;girl things&quot;.  There are characters in the book which weren't included in the excellent 1962 film, such as the matronly scold Aunt Alexandra and Zeebo, Calpurnia's (the much-loved black housekeeper) son.  Miss Dubose is a crotchety caution who's addicted to morphine (she falls asleep at the same time everyday while Jem reads to her - as punishment for destroying her garden). Miss Maudie and Stephanie Crawford are amusing characters.  I love the part when Ms. Crawford claimed that Boo Radley was gazing at her from outside her bedroom window  - Miss Maudie curtly replied thusly:   &quot;Well, what did you do, Stephanie? - move over and make room for him?&quot; That shut her up. The comical moments are amusingly life-like and therefore easy to relate to.  The surprisingly powerful and emotional revelation towards the end of the novel is something which one can only  experience by reading literature of the top rank; this Pulizer Prize - winning novel has won the hearts of millions and will undoubtedly enlighten generations to come!	2001-10-17

I first read this book at about the age of ten, after watching the 1944 film on late night on television (I was enthralled).  There are sub-plots and characters which weren't included in the movie version, but Macardle's fluid writing style keeps one's interest until the last page.   The story is about strange ghostly disturbances at &quot;Cliff End&quot; (in the movie, the Georgian house was re-named &quot;Windward&quot;).   There are wonderful characters: the Fitzgeralds (Pamela and Roderick) who are siblings, Stella Merideth, the young moonstruck girl who's enchanted by the dangers which lure her into  her mother's past.  Commander Beech is gruff and Miss Holloway is cold and rather heartless (especially towards Stella; her supposed mother was an &quot;intimate friend&quot; of Holloway's).  The Spanish Gypsy - Carmel Casada - whom Llewellyn used as a model for his paintings holds the key to the puzzle....Macardle uses plenty of exclaimation marks throughout the book and her writing style is a wee bit dated - but this story has an ingeniously unique twist in which readers of the ghost genre should appreciate.

Ever since it was initially published in 1959, THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE has been Shirley Jackson's gift to countless readers around the world who have relished reading this highly original and exceptionally chilling ghost story - if a there is such a thing as a ghost story receiving cult status - then this ingenious novellette would definitely qualify for first prize! Not the type of terror you'd find in a Stephen King (he was a Jackson fan who dedicated FIRESTARTER to &quot;Shirley Jackson, who never needed to raise her voice&quot;) or Dean Koontz novel. Jackson's technique is much more finely grained and subtle: this is literature. There are Freudian aspects to be sure, but the symbolism is amazing; (did anyone catch the meaning of the heading?) thirty years after I first read the book (I was nine) I found new symbolic elements which I had missed priorly. Jackson paints her heroine Eleanor Vance as a rather drab and timid wisp of a thing: a 32 year-old spinster who's &quot;never known a life of her own&quot;. As you commence reading the book, you are drawn inside the mind of a schizoid person who desperately needs to be loved, yet cannot relate to people rationally, so she finds a safe friend in Hill House itself. Jackson writes in a poetic and mystical fashion which aids the reader throughout the book. Theodora is a free-spirited psychic who's rather spoiled and cheeky personality gives a much - needed contrast to Eleanor's repressed child-woman thinking. There is a scene in a grove of trees: Theo: &quot;I don't understand. Do you always go where you're not wanted?&quot; Eleanor: &quot;But I've never been wanted ANYWHERE&quot;. Tingling aspects rise from little nuances throughout: Nell suggests that they look for namelessgraves in the nettle patch when she and Theo become bored, a phantom picnic where there is a vision of sunshine, children and a puppy (at night!), walls with dripping blood reaching out for Eleanor to Come Home; a harp which plays by itself, the &quot;cold spot&quot; in the heart of the house, the cup of stars, the stone lions, the oleanders etc. Eleanor is given a bedroom painted blue, the colour of depression. The men in the novel are more like props, supporting players. It's like a spooky version of Lucy and Ethel getting themselves into another scrape with Ricky and Fred simply there when neccesary. Luke and Montague ask what happened while they were outdoors chasing SOMETHING. Eleanor: &quot;Nothing in particular. Someone knocked on the door with a cannonball, then laughed their fool head off when we wouldn't let them in, but nothing out of the ordinary&quot; There are no real &quot;evil&quot; characters in the book: it is a foray into the mind of someone so desperately longing for understanding, love and companionship that she knows not where she goes.............	2001-08-21

Her playing of Ethel Mertz on the legendary \\"I Love Lucy\\" show was so honest and her timing and delivery were impeccable. Vance seemed to BE Ethel (she wasn't). This thoroughly engaging and well-researched biography gives us personal glimpses of Vance's sometimes hectic and chaotic life along with her many stage roles and little-known marriages. I once read a biography on the unique silent star Louise Brooks -she was also a native of the tiny rural town of Cherryvale - she and Vivian's sister Venus were friends. The author of the book went to Brook's birthplace in order to collect data. Inquiring a local woman with an indifferent attitude about Brooks, she remarked brusquely: \\"You know, Vivian Vance was raised here too, and I always thought she was TEN times more talented than Louise ever was!\\" The co-authors obviously relished writing about their Emmy award-winning subject and we I LOVE LUCY fans around the world are delighted that our Viv is finally given the recognition and kudos she so richly deserves!	2000-05-15

Author Oppenheimer gives us an interesting account of Jackson's sometimes lovely/sometimes tortured life and the biography is well-researched (except when she states the in THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE Eleanor runs her car into a wall instead of a TREE!) Interesting tidbits include Jackson's rather vainly foolish mother (Geraldine) who was more concerned with Jackson's appearance in photographs taken for magazine interviews than her undeniable talent. Jackson was an amateur white witch who kept cats and loved to mesmorize and be mesmorized; she was like a female version of Stephen King!	1999-12-06

This lady has such a refreshing sense of humour and she makes us understand things in a way which previously seemed rather intangible to comprehend. There are so many things in my life and in the lives of my friends and family which are unexplained in a spirtual sense; reincarnation, hauntings (in Scotland?) \\"coincidiences\\" and past lives as a whole are fascinating subjects which most of us shrug our shoulders at (out of fear and ignorance, I suspect) Sylvia is the real thing and I would really like to meet this extraordinary woman!	1999-12-06

The chapter on numerology was fascinating as it gives certain herbs, colours,  foods and jewelry which are beneficial to a &quot;5&quot; person, for  instance.I have yet to try her theory of ingesting orange and yellow foods  in order to lose weight, but a friend of mine swears it works! This is  Goodman's ultimate collection of New Age wisdom and it's downright fun to  read: highly recommended!	1999-12-06

Kathleen Winsor's book was immensely popular when it was first published in the mid-forties.  The beautiful movie star Ava Gardner was caught reading it once by her intellectually brilliant bandleader husband Artie Shaw (who dismissed it as trash); after the two divorced, Shaw married author Winsor much to Gardner's dismay and fury!  Justly famous for it's earthiness and realism, the author writes with impeccable attention to historical detail and this book is highly recommended!	1999-12-06

A much beloved classic among modern American novels, Harper Lee's only book is truly an exciting and thoughtful reading experience! Those kids are so funny and real and the town of Maycomb comes alive in your head (Maycomb is actually the small Alabama town of Monroeville fictionalized). The character of Dill is based on Lee's childhood friend Truman Capote!  <br />This book gave me a wonderful sense of what the South was like during the depression and I loved the author's illustrious descriptions: Nehi soda , the Chinaberry trees, Collard patches etc.  The character of Aunt Alexandria was never seen in the movie, but she's a welcome addition to the story as is the dope addicted Miss Dubose (who's seen all to briefly in the film version) Lee is such a gifted writer that it's a shame that this is her sole entry in the world of literature.	1999-12-06

Author Evangeline Adams (1865 - 1932) was the most esteemed astrologer of her day and she even had her own radio spot in the early '30's. At the turn of the century she predicted that a hotel owner was in the worst possible danger after examining his chart; he scoffed and his hotel burned to the ground in a bizarre fire immediately afterwards (No, she didn't commit arson!) Adams convinced a judge in New York City in 1914 that Astrology was an &quot;exact science&quot; . She was handed an anonymous birthdate (it was the judge's sons') and proceeded to tell the judge, with amazing accuracy details of the man's character, talents and major events in his life! - her case was dropped after she was accused of &quot;fortunetelling&quot; (which was then against New York state law). This remarkable woman foresaw WWII and her very own death in 1932. Any book this woman wrote is invaluable concerning the subject of astrology because she wrote in a fresh, clear and easily understood manner. I wish someone would write a biography about this very interesting person who was ahead of her time in her thinking and actions.	1999-12-06
