Pat Conroy's Fourth Novel.<br /><br />In the American south, Pat Conroy is something of a literary hero.  Born and raised in coastal South Carolina, Conroy's novels focus on the good and the bad parts about being a southerner, and his works have become legendary in the south. Nonetheless, his novels are bestsellers world over, and his books frequent the top of the charts for weeks at a time. After releasing the hit 'The Great Santini', Pat Conroy took a long break to write 'The Lords of Discipline', an almost autobiographical account of Conroy's stay at The Citadel. The book went on to spawn a movie and achieve moderate success, but it's not one of his best known. Since this was my first book by Conroy that I read, I was expecting a good book. So, was I pleased or disappointed with the book? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Story-<br /><br />Will McLean has always felt different from everyone around him at The Citadel. His liberal views, his dislike of the traditions of the school, and his bitterness towards his school has always set him apart. Although, because of the fact of his good sense of humor and he's the captain of the basketball team, Will has always been well liked. At the beginning of his senior year, Will is told by the Bear( the disciplinary dean) to watch after a black freshman who is entering the Citadel. The Bear also tells Will to be wary of a secret society known as The Ten, which tortures students until they agree to leave the school. As the year passes, Will slowly relaxes into the college life, doing schoolwork, preparing for exams, but suddenly he is forced into a confrontation that could destroy his friends and cause him to not graduate from college. Will must use all of his courage and cleverness to outsmart his enemies who are trying to run him out of college...<br /><br />Writing-<br /><br />Pat Conroy is a masterful storyteller, and 'The Lords of Discipline' really proved this to me. This book, from start to finish, was a breeze. I read it every chance I had... in the car, at night, during class... I just found the book to be, quite frankly, one of the best books I'd ever read. Conroy's story is so believable and seemingly real because he actually experienced many of the things he chronicled in this novel in the first place. I don't have much more to say... this book was great.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Lords of Discipline' really surprised me. It was a superb novel, and kept me reading all day just to find out the end. I really think this book is a good choice for anyone trying to get into Pat Conroy or someone looking for a good drama/suspense/military novel. It's great... nothing more to say!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PAT CONROY, DRAMA NOVELS, AND CITADEL GRADUATES!  A GREAT NOVEL...

Band of Brothers(1992). A Non-Fiction novel by Stephen E. Ambrose.<br /><br />In World War II, as Hitler and The Third Reich rose up against Europe, America's brave young soldiers were deployed into an event the world will never forget. In the Army, many fine soldiers gave their lives to defend our freedom, and, to this day, no battalion was as decorated and remembered as well as the 101st Airborne Division. As good as any rifle company in the world, Easy Company, part of the 101st Airborne Division, was responsible for parachuting into Normandy on D-Day, freezing in the Battle of the Bulge, and liberating Hitler's Eagle Nest at Berchtesgaden. Although they suffered causalities of over 125%, Easy Company remained intact, a band of brothers until the end. With all the heroics and legendary tales about Easy Company, it's no surprise that Stephen E. Ambrose, author of D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, recounted the history of Easy Company. Drawing from hours of research and interviews, Ambrose recounted the stories of these American heroes, and his effort turned into a New York Times Bestseller and a very successful HBO miniseries. So, was the book your typical history novel, or a breathtaking history of Easy Company? Read on to find out...<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />The United States is at war, and to preserve our freedom, they must fight for liberty and peace with the nation's finest, the elite soldiers who do what they must to protect our country. No matter where you came from, may it be the North, South, Midwest, or California, World War II soldiers shared a common bond with each other, a sense of comradeship that lasted through life until death. For Easy Company, 101st Airborne, the dreadful Camp Toccoa brought them together. There, the company faced the harshest tasks, from running 25-miles to doing a thousand push-ups, and the soldiers felt the same aches and scars together. After months of intense physical workouts and numerous parachuting exercises, General Patton is ready to deploy Easy Company for their first mission. As part of an elaborate plan (D-Day), Easy Company is ordered to take out the numerous gun batteries around Normandy to provide cover for the infantry coming from Omaha Beach. In that day, Easy Company showed valor and courage beyond imagination: with just about 50 men, Easy Company inflicted casualties four times that. After that, Easy Company was shipped off to Holland to help with Operation MARKET-GARDEN, and fight in the subzero temperatures of the Battle of the Bulge. Easy Company was also the first army regiment to take Berchtesgaden, a nazi stronghold. Throughout their adventures, Easy Company became world-renowned, taking place in the most important battles of World War II, and receiving massive attention. To this day, Easy Company's adventures are still being researched today, and their legacy will live on forever.<br /><br />Writing/Opinions-<br /><br />I don't like non-fiction, much less historical non-fiction. Even though, I've always been fascinated by war and its aftermath, and I was a big fan of the TV miniseries 'Band of Brothers', so I decided to pick this novel for a project. Fortunately, I didn't write this novel off, because, this is by far the best book about World War II I've ever read, and it kept me interested on every page. Stephen E. Ambrose extensively and thoroughly researched Easy Company, compiling hours and hours of interviews from survivors and studying journals, so this novel could catch every little thing, and the results are breathtakingly surreal. I wondered many times where Ambrose could have gotten some of his facts, but they're all documented. Ambrose lays the battle scenes out with perfect precision, never missing a beat, keeping the reader enthralled on the field of battle, and even when Easy Company's taking a break from war! Ambrose is a magnificent historian, and it shows in his work!<br /><br />Overall, 'Band of Brothers' is an excellent novel on World War II and Easy Company, and the books fast-pace and realism kept me interested all the way through. Every scene was intense and passionate, and Ambrose never fails to miss even the most unimportant information. If a biography could get more specific, I'd like to see it! Ambrose excels in writing and research, and that really shows in his non-fiction, which reads like any fiction novel.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF WORLD WAR II, HISTORY, THE 101ST AIRBORNE, OR STEPHEN AMBROSE.

A Novel By Horror Author Stephen King.<br /><br />With Stephen King's first novel, 'Carrie', he carefully explored the phenomenon of supernatural and psychic abilities that are inside of us all, just waiting to be tapped. With 'Firestarter', King attempts yet again to write a novel all about psychic abilities, or, in this case, pyrokenesis. While the novel revolves around pyrokenesis, it also describes the secrecy and greed of the government, and how they manipulate their citizens to satisfy their own needs. After the release of 'Cujo' and 'The Stand', two of King's most acclaimed novels, people could only wait for 'Firestarter', which became a huge hit like its predecessors. So, was I impressed with 'Firestarter', or just dissapointed? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />Charlie McGee, an innocent little 7 year old, has a terrible secret. In the flick of an eye, she can start fires, and she is oftentimes unable to stop them. Because of Charlie's inhuman abilities, The Shop(an elite branch of the CIA), constantly pursues Charlie and her father Andy to be able to study Charlie for militairy use. As Charlie and Andy travel all over the eastern coast, from New York to Maine, The Shop is always one step behind, giving meaning to the phrase, \\"you can run, but you can't hide.\\" Although they may be at a disadvantage, Charlie and Andy are constantly trying to find a way to tell the world their sad story, and end the persecution of themselves. Can they do it? You'll have to find out...<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />While I've been reading Dean Koontz lately, I've never picked up and read 'Firestarter', supposedly one of Stephen King's strongest novels. I decided to read it, and I'm glad I did. While this book may be typically overlooked by novels like 'Cujo' and 'IT', it's no less riveting and thoughtful, able to capture your imagination and keep it. King writes about government conspiracies and psychic abilities, and makes his fictional accounts seem breathtakingly real, as if this may be happening right around you. King has always seemed to be a better author in the late 70's and early 80's, as his novels are better-written, and, often better plotted, and 'Firestarter' is no less different. As I read the book, the pages seemed to be on fire(couldn't help it!), but I was delighted to see the pure emotion and care King put into 'Firestarter'. While it was never a pivotal or famous book in his catalogue, 'Firestarter' is a King novel no fan should pass up.<br /><br />Overall, 'Firestarter' is a spooky thriller that scares you with the possibilities of a corrupt government and supernatural abilities, while keeping you glued to the novel until it's fiery finale. Definitely a book for any King fan, 'Firestarter' is sure to please almost any reader with an eye for suspense and who likes to have a few sleepless nights.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE AND STEPHEN KING!

His name is synonymous with things that go bump in the night and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, and is often compared to the King of Macabre, Stephen King. While his books usually are easily comprehendible and \\"to-the-point,\\" with 'Strangers', Dean Koontz has produced his \\"epic\\". Almost every author has an \\"epic,\\" or, in the case of Charles Dickens, sometimes 4 or 5. A novel huge in size and thought, with in-depth characters, profound messages and morals, massive and interweaving plots and sub-plots, it's most easily defined as a novel that \\"makes you think\\"! 'Strangers', weighing in at 681 pages, is a tale of government intrigue, with a massive cover-up that included brainwashing the memories of over 30 people who stayed at The Tranquility Motel in rural Nevada to make them forget the horrors of July 6th, 1984. After experiencing disturbing nightmares and odd disorders like sleepwalking and phobias, Ginger Weiss, Dominick Corvaisis, Brendan Cronin, Jack Twist, Sandy and Ned Sarver, and Faye and Ernie Block slowly are drawn back to The Tranquility Motel, where fate and destiny awaits... Did I enjoy 'Strangers' or not? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot- As Ginger, Brendan, Dom, Faye, Jack, Ernie, Ned, and Sandy return to The Tranquility Motel, they seem to know each other like friends, even though they've never met. As the character's memory blocks slowly start to disappear, they slowly begin to remember the occurrence on July 6th, yet before they can determine what happen, the government decides to apprehend them and sanction them. Later, Brendan and Dom discover they have supernatural powers, able to lift things at will and heal injured people, and they believe it's related to what happened to them on that night. As miraculous healings and supernatural events begin happening all over the world, the government soon realizes its cover-up is fading, and they must either admit what happened or destroy the evidence and make up something. As the government prepares to wipe out the evidence of the mysterious event, they methodically capture the witnesses to the event and sanction them in a nearby base, Thunder Hill Depository, where the secret lays hundreds of miles underground. As the characters fight for their lives, they will have to learn to band together and help each other, and learn to face the truth of that horrifying night...<br /><br />Opinions/Writing/Etc.-<br /><br />Dean Koontz is a writer, who, unlike a large number of his contemporaries(Grisham, Ludlum), thinks up original, suspenseful, and delightful plots with each novel, and he never scrapes the surface of being generic or repetitive. With 'Strangers', Koontz tries his hand at a novel of immense proportions, carefully building up each of his characters personas and developing them throughout the novel, until each character seems like a close friend. This is important, because when the characters are in trouble or in danger, the reader feels and pities them, giving 'Strangers' a stronger depth and emotion. Throughout, Koontz explores many themes such as love, faith, friendship, and determination, and by the novel's end, you will piece together the morals and messages Koontz has interlaid within his writing. 'Strangers' moves along slowly at first, introducing the numerous characters and unearthing the controversial mystery, but as the novel nears its end, you'll be on the edge of your seat and the pages will fly by. Koontz's writing isn't fancy or overly descriptive like most classic novels, yet he's straight-forward and to-the-point, almost as if he's telling the story around a campfire to a group of enrapt listeners. The only thing that hurts the novel is that the \\"mystery\\" behind the suspense of 'Strangers' is fairly predictable and lackluster, yet, it's not as bad as it could have been. My opinion? A great novel!<br /><br />Overall, 'Strangers' is a great thriller, full of mystery and suspense that will keep the reader guessing until the end. The plot is very epic, so, young readers, beware! The sheer amount of characters and plot twists will go right over your head. For those willing to take that extra leap and read 'Strangers', be prepared for an epic novel, full of mystery and hopeful themes that will definitely be a highlight in anyone's bookshelf.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE, MYSTERIES, THRILLERS, AND DEAN KOONTZ!

A Novel By Horror/Suspense Author Dean Koontz.<br /><br />In the 1970's, technology was a feeble imagination, with TV's and telephones being the only household item, while today, it's hard not to find something digital! Dean Koontz, in the early 1970's, saw the use of Cray super-computers and Digital Security, and he pitched an idea for the story, where an emotional computer virus comes in control of a person's security system. While the story may have seemed far-fetched at the time, it has aged well, and now, everything in the novel doesn't seem very odd! Needless to say, I was interested in the novel's surreal plot, so I picked up 'Demon Seed'. Did I enjoy it as much as I thought I would? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />Susan Harris, a rich entrepeuner, is holed up in her secluded house, which is protected by an advanced security system, which runs every aspect of the house, from air conditioning to opening the windows. Other than her servants, which come for only a few hours each day, she is in basic seclusion with her security system. Without Susan knowing, a foreign virus, created by her husband's old company, takes over her security system, and it intends for Susan to give birth to the virus's child, an all-knowing and emotional being. As Susan desperately seeks to escape the virus's mindless grip, she must learn to destroy what cannot be killed...<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />'Demon Seed' is a fast-paced, no-holds-barred thriller. This novel, which is short and to-the-point, should only take the reader a day or so to read. I read this in a few short days, and, while being a good novel, I found it to be far too short. Don't get me wrong, this book is over 250 pages, but, by the end of the novel, you don't care for the characters, or even be sure about the plot. I think the novel isn't as tight as it could have been, and, at times, it seems to go on without a plot, just rambling for a while. Also, at the end of the novel, the book seems unfinished and rushed, as if Koontz barely gave it a thought before ending it. On a positive note, since the novel is read by the computer virus, it gives the book an odd, yet incredibly immersive and original feel that Koontz has always been able to do.<br /><br />Overall, 'Demon Seed' is a good, if not flawed thriller. I really had no big problems with this, except the plot was sadly rushed and, at times, poor. If Koontz had only made this 100 pages longer and improved upon the character development and thickened the plot, this *would* have been an excellent read, yet it falls to just being a *good* novel. Don't come in expecting a masterpiece, but, if you're new to Koontz, I doubt you'll be disappointed, and if you're a fan, be sure to pick this up.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF THRILLERS AND DEAN KOONTZ! 4 STARS FOR HAVING A SKETCHY PLOT AND POOR ENDING; OTHERWISE IT WAS A GREAT READ!<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Phantoms- Dean Koontz<br /><br />IT- Stephen King<br /><br />Koko- Peter Straub<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!the end of the novel, the book seems unfinished and rushed, as if Koontz barely gave it a thought before ending it.

Novel By Horror/Suspense Author Dean Koontz.<br /><br />After developing quite a taste for Horror/Suspense novels with Stephen King, I naturally started looking for new authors to read, and, of course, Dean Koontz was my next likely pick. Anyways, 'The Servants of Twilight', originally titled 'Twilight', is a very poignant novel, breaching the subject of religious fanaticism and martyrism, something all to common in today's hostile world of religious terrorists. So, was I impressed or turned off by 'The Servants Of Twilight'? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />Grace Spivey leads the Church of the Twilight, a religious cult determined to find and destroy the antichrist before he can rule the world for 1,000 years, called the \\"twilight\\" by Grace Spivey. She leads a cult of over 1,000 people, ranging from Policemen, Doctors, and Burglars. While Grace is looking for the Antichrist, middle-aged single wife Christine Scavello takes her 6-year old son Joey to the mall, where they are confronted by Spivey. She claims Joey \\"has to die\\" and \\"he will be killed\\". Spivey continues to harass them, peeking through their windows, killing their dog, and stalking them, and Christine hires Private Detective Charlie Harrison to find out who Grace Spivey is and protect them. As Grace Spivey amasses her followers and relates to them their new enemy(Joey), Christine is confronted with her worst nightmare: More than 1,000 people trying to kill her son Joey. From machine gun raids to car bombs, Christine must do all she can to save Joey, herself, and Charlie, putting her life on the line for those that she loves.<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc-<br /><br />Dean Koontz has always struck me as a slightly sadistic author, and 'The Servants Of Twilight' is the best possible example of this. Imagine your loved one being hunted by thousands of people hellbent on killing him for fanatical and insane reasons. It doesn't seem likely, yet in today's hostile environment, it reminds us that nothing is impossible. Dean Koontz blends intense suspense with a believeable plot, and his ability to put the readers inside his character's head lets the story move incredibly fast. The subject matter is also very meaningful, and Koontz shows all the flaws in religion and human nature. Grace Spivey is the most unlikely villian, a frail old lady, but to hear her mad ravings and insane, yet powerful message lets the reader see the true horror inside of us all, waiting to be tapped; although the idea of believing her may seem far-fetched, I would imagine many would fall into her hold. The Servants of Twilight is a well-written, powerful novel that will strike a chord with any reader.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Servants Of Twilight' is a classic Dean Koontz novel, capable of putting you on the edge of your seat and giving you nightmares later. The religious undertones, the believeable characters, and the realistic plot only help the novel, giving it a deep sense of suspense and mystery.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE NOVELS, THRILLERS, MYSTERIES, AND DEAN KOONTZ!

William Peter Blatty's First #1 Bestselling Novel.<br /><br />In 1971, 'The Exorcist' leaked out to bookstores everywhere, and critics instantly praised the novel for it's spell-binding and disturbing subject matter, not to mention it dealt with the problems of the day(the 70's) and was written well. With the critics behind it, people began to pick up the novel daily, and it became quite controversial, building up controversy from christians and (oddly) satanists, not to mention scaring the be-jesus out of the easily frightened. THAT was before the movie came out. When 'The Exorcist' debuted in theaters, it became easily the highest grossing horror film, and to this day, among 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Shining', is considered the scariest movie ever. Today, the movie is a household name, yet few actually know of the book. Well, as usual, behind every good movie there's always a book, so, being a fan of the movie, I decided to check out the book that originated it. So, was I happy or  disheartened with the results? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />For Chris Macneil, budding actor/director, she and her 12-year old daughter Regan(known as Rags affectionately) spend a humble tenure at an apartment near Georgetown University, where Chris is shooting a movie with renound director Burke Dennings. Chris is exceptionally happy to learn that her agent has even gotten her a directing job, something she's wanted but not been able to get for years! Soon after the good news, weird things start happening to Chris and her daughter Regan. During the middle of the night, mysterious thumps and scratches are heard, and Regan's furniture is moved to odd parts of the room without her knowing. Oddly, Regan even starts muttering obscenities that even her mother didn't know! Then, at a dinner party, Regan, dressed only in a nightgown, came down in front of all of Chris's friends and \\"wet\\" herself and fainted. After this *disturbance*, Chris takes Regan to a psychiatrist, who notices Regan's odd behavior but can't diagnose it(he believes she's suffering from depression). As the months go by, Regan progresses to the point where she is turned from a cute, loveable young 12-year old to a disgusting, hate-filled monster, undoubtedly not the person that her mother knows. As her mother desperately searches for her problem, with psychiatrists and doctors, thinking Regan is possessed, she risks her one last hope on local Jesuit Damien Karras before Regan disappears forever.....<br /><br />Writing/Opinion/Etc.-<br /><br />'The Exorcist', unlike the movie, hardly features any interaction between the priest and Regan until the end, so most of the novel you see Regan's general descension into her own hell. As the reader knows, Regan is possessed by a demon, but psychiatrists and doctors try to convince Chris otherwise, and it shows how stubborn people can be, when clearly Regan isn't suffering from any \\"known disease\\". Blatty's dialogue of Regan and Chris's hellish expirience is professional and imaginative, basing fiction on fact to create a story rich with disturbing possibilities and documented truths. One thing you'll get out of the novel is a deep understanding of mental disorders, satanism, possesion, and religion, and all of Blatty's \\"statements\\" are entirely true, even if the plot isn't, making it all the more eerie. While the story starts slowly, as soon as Regan starts to \\"misplace\\" things in her room the story is set in motion and doesn't slow down from then until the apocolyptic ending, and the reader is *possessed* to read the book in a few days. 'The Exorcist' is all it's cracked up to be, a chilling portrait of possession that blends fiction with fact to create an easily possible story that the reader might have trouble sleeping on. While Blatty's basic point is the never-ending battle between \\"Good & Evil\\", I liked how neither side *won* at the end of the novel, and the reader never learns if the demon was killed or not.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Exorcist' is a chilling, eerily possible novel on possession that stays believeable and well-written throughout to create a book enjoyable not only to *popcorn* readers but to Lit teachers too.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF HORROR, FICTION, AND THE MOVIE!

A Novel By Suspense/Thriller Writer Dean Koontz.<br /><br />In the Late-50's, many companies experimented with the use of subliminals to make people go out and buy their products. While a big controversy at the time, the public soon forgot about it, yet, to this day, companies still use subliminal advertising to try and get people to buy their products. Although subliminals aren't visible to your conscious mind, your sub-conscious mind fully comprehends the hidden messages, and almost on instinct, 70% of the time the person will buy that product. Although the ads never technically \\"forced\\" anybody to buy the product, Dean Koontz explores in 'Night Chills' the scary possibility that someone could use subliminals to the point of total mind control. Since I was intrigued by the original and disturbing storyline, I decided to pick up 'Night Chills'. So, much like Koontz's other novels, was 'Night Chills' a masterpiece or a sorry state of affairs? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />In the peaceful logging town of Black River, population 400, things are about to get out of hand. Scientist Ogden Salsbury, after discovering a drug, that combined with subliminals, can induce total mind control, hurriedly seeks out millionare Leonard Dawson to be his partner in taking over the world. To test the drug, they choose to wreak havoc on the peaceful town of Black River. After putting the *mind-control* drug in the town's water supply and exposing the townspeople to a TV show filled with subliminals, Salsbury goes in to see if he can control the townspeople. With just the mention of the code-phrase \\"I am the key\\", he unlocks the townspeople's minds to his every wish, and they can't help but go along. Meanwhile, the Addendale family, which includes 11-year old Rya and 8-year old Mark, not to mention their middle-aged father Paul take their yearly camping trip to Black River, and finds that everybody but them and the Edison family is suffering from night chills. As the Addendales and the Edison's dig deeper into the mass conspiracy that Ogden Salsbury has started, they must find a way to stop it, or else find themselves under Salsbury's control...<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />'Night Chills', as any Koontz fan will agree too, isn't his best, yet it undoubtedly does what you've come to expect from Koontz: From start to finish, the gripping plotline and intricate plot twists will keep the reader enthralled throughout. Well, to no surprise, that holds true. Koontz divides the chapters between the main characters, so, one moment you'll find yourself reading the adventures of the Addendales and the next you'll find yourself gripped by the demented and disturbing acts of Salsbury and Dawson. I particuarly enjoy this style of writing, and thought it was a great idea on Koontz's part, as the reader gets to know the characters well. Koontz's eerily-possible story about Mind-control and subliminals was a great idea, and he really fleshes out all the details until the reader begins to wonder if this could one day happen to her. Unlike other reviewers have commented, this novel is in no way \\"very boring\\" or \\"drab\\", as I found myself reading for hours to finish this novel before I died of wondering what would happen! My only complaints, and hence the 4.5 rating, is that Koontz's scenes with Salsbury, which include raping and murdering people, get repetitive, but nevertheless they also hold your attention. Also, the ending, while fulfilling, seemed a tad rushed, and as usual you could have predicted the ending considerably before it happened.<br /><br />Overall, 'Night Chills' is a great, enthralling, disturbing, and eerie novel that just begs to be read! Although the explicit language and adult content isn't suitable for children, and unless you're a picky adult, you wouldn't be taken aback by this novel. Like I said, when you pick up a Koontz novel, you can expect a first-rate thriller, and once again, he doesn't fail to deliver.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE NOVELS, THRILLERS, HORROR NOVELS AND DEAN KOONTZ.

A Recent Novel By Suspense Novelist Dean Koontz.<br /><br />Right around the time of 'Odd Thomas's release, Stephen King's 'Wolves of the Calla' appeared shortly thereafter, dimming the magnificent flame of anticipation this novel had put out, yet it was still there. Before the novel was even released, numerous publications were posting that this was \\"Koontz's best in years!\\" or saying it was a masterpiece, and even though I didn't know any of Koontz's work(I knew him as an author), 'Odd Thomas' appealed to me for my fanhood of Stephen King, and I thought about getting it. To my disavantadge, I neglected 'Odd Thomas' until I recently got into his other work, and now have finally gotten my hands on this critical and commercial triumph(It broke the Top 5 in the NYT Book List). So, is 'Odd Thomas' the book it's so hyped up to be, or a run-of-the-mill thriller? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />In the peaceful Californian town of Pico Munde, things are about to get dangerous, and local fry cook Odd Thomas is right in the middle of the impending attack. Odd Thomas is your basic laid-back adult, choosing to live a simple life, with his friends and his \\"gift\\" being the only things that concern him. That \\"gift\\" is the ability to see the dead, and numerous unearthly appariotions too. Sound like The Sixth Sense? It should! Odd Thomas frequently helps out local Police Chief Wyatt Porter in discovering murderers, as ghosts take him to their attackers, and frequently at scenes of murders are hellish, shady apparitions known as Bodachs. These figures only appear when murders are about to be committed, and one day, while flipping burgers, Odd notices an extremely large amount of Bodachs to be swarming around a man Odd begins to refer to as the \\"Fungus Man\\". As his suspicion reaches the breaking point, Odd goes as far as to break into the man's house, and upon finding a shrine to serial killers and a portal to hell, he is set on finding out his secrets and his ghastly plans. As Odd embroils himself with the \\"Fungus Man\\", he will risk his life to save the lives of many other, and to prevent a catastrophic destruction of the peaceful town of Pico Munde.<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />'Odd Thomas', as you will soon find out, is supposed to be written as a memoir by the main character to look on his heroic adventure. From the opening pages, the reader quickly falls in love with his humble prose and naive tone, yet his punctual descriptions pack the punch of Shakespeare. With that said, Koontz's writing is fast-paced and full of plot twists, not to mention sub-plots that actually enliven the story instead of bogging it down. For lack of better words, 'Odd Thomas' is \\"odd\\"! From the opening scene, where a ghost leads Odd to her killer, the reader is rather taken-aback, but as the novel progresses and we find out about the ghosts of Elvis and Lyndon Johnson, it all seems very familar, and you can't help but acknowledge the active imagination that went into drafting this novel. That imagination, and the intense character development is what keeps 'Odd Thomas' from being your typical run-of-the-mill thriller, and I enjoyed the fact that Odd wasn't some big, bulky, hot-shot, but a regular, if a tad too regular, guy. 'Odd Thomas' is a heartfelt, intensely caring novel, and it will hook you in from the start to the climactic finish.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

By Horror/Suspense Author Dean Koontz.<br /><br />Since the beginning of time, throughout the world, unexplainable mass disappearances frequent the world, with humans and animals vanishing without a trace, oddly leaving their prized possessions behind. In 'Phantoms', Dean Koontz tries to explain the unexplainable, from the disappearances of the dinosaurs, the Roanoke Island Colony, the Eskimo Village of Anjikuni, the vanishment of the Mayan population, and thousands of Spanish and Chinese soldiers, but those are just a few of many. Ever wonder why ships are commonly found deserted? Koontz tells all. 'Phantoms' served as my introduction to Dean Koontz, so does it live up to my expectations or does it turn out mediocre? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot- After the death of Jenny and Lisa Paige's mother, 31-Year old doctor Jenny takes her 14- Year old sister Lisa home to live with her in quaint California village Snowfield, population 500. As Jenny and Lisa enter the town, they soon notice the lack of sound or people, and they quickly grow uneasy at the lack of people. As they enter Jenny's house, they find her housekeeper Hilda on the kitchen floor bruised, bloated, and dead. Jenny can't figure out the cause of death, and as they visit other houses in town, they soon find out the same fate has befell the entire town, and corpses are sometimes left behind, but mostly everyone's vanished, sometimes with dinner on the table and CD players still running. Jenny and Lisa soon get the ominous feeling they are being watched, and as they go through town, they realize that someTHING, not human, is out there preying on the town. As they search for a phone to call the County Police, they see dark shadows everywhere they go, and after finally contacting the police, are scared to death. As the County Police arrive, they join Jenny and Lisa in exploring the mystery of the town's fate, and what they find out turns out to be their worst nightmare, and unmistakeingly the \\"Ancient Enemy\\" of the world...<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />Being a fan of Stephen King and Horror, Dean Koontz seemed a likely choice for a new author to enjoy. Fortuneatly, I picked up 'Phantoms' in the Library, and am now a big fan of Koontz. Dean Koontz writing is written with an unmistakeable mood of gloom and doom, yet you also get the sense of hope and that good will prevail. Koontz's writing is very colorful, and his descriptions are so vivid to the point of terror. 'Phantoms' reads like greased lightning, in other words, you CAN'T put this one down! I read 'Phantoms' in two days, and with Koontz's gloomy dialogue, enthralling mystery, pulsing suspense, turn-on-the-lights horror, and maddeningly brilliant plot twists, it's almost impossible not to. Another thing I like about Koontz is his connection to other novels and authors, and with 'Phantoms', he connects with 'The Invasion of the Body Snatchers', 'IT', and 'Sphere'. 'Phantoms' begins with your typical 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' scenario, where everyone's gone and something not human is at work here, and in a particuarly riveting scene where Jenny spots a moving thing in the rafters, it's obviously a good idea by Koontz. 'Phantoms' soon carries off in the direction of Stephen King's 'IT', in which an eternal and immortal monster preys on the Earth, and a few individuals must learn to destroy this monster. With Michael Chrichton's 'Sphere', 'Phantoms' also features an indescribable and amorphus villian, where the monster can morph into any creature he pleases. Remember the scene in 'Sphere' where they talk to the monster via computer? Well, 'Phantoms' has a scene EXACTLY like it! 'Phantoms' packs the punch of a knuckle sandwich, giving the reader a plausible and terrifyingly realistic and eeriely possible reason for disappearances around the world, and Koontz depthly uses his reasons in ways that will give nightmares to casual Horror readers. What more can I say? 'Phantoms' isa top-notch suspense/thriller that encompassed any expectations I had, and now is one of my favorite novels!<br /><br />Overall, 'Phantoms' epitomizes what a Thriller should be, a novel that grips you and holds you until the last word at levels of suspense high enough to touch the sky, and Dean Koontz molds a story that does that and MORE! I'm in the middle of Koontz's new novel 'Odd Thomas', and I can safely say he's one of my favorite authors, easily!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF SUSPENSE NOVELS, THRILLERS, HORROR NOVELS, ADVENTURE NOVELS, AND DEAN KOONTZ!

Elizabeth George Speare's Newberry Award Winning Novel.<br /><br />Throughout popular literature, Historical Fiction is either a delight to some or a horror(quite literally) novel to some. Judging from my past experiences, I'd say I would easily fall into the second category, as most become drab and inconsistent mid-way or partially through. When I was assigned to read 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' for Summer Reading, I took the novel on almost as a challenge and a burden at the same time. Anyways, with its 1958 release, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' received heavy critical acclaim, and even received the prestigious John Newberry Award and an ALA Notable Book Award. So, was 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' a surprisingly good novel, or a hopelessly jumbled mix of words? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />16-Year old Katherine Taylor, fondly known as Kit, has left her dreamy Caribbean home for the dreary Puritan life of rural Connecticut. After her beloved Grandfather's death, the only way she could get away from lustful men(of 50!) and debts was to stow away on the 'Dolphin' for a ride to her Aunt's humble abode. Upon her arrival, she clearly doesn't fit in, as she was accustomed to a laid-back lifestyle, yet once the family brings her in, day in and day out, she works still sundown, and by then she's supposed to listen to lengthy preachings on the Bible. Her new frustrating lifestyle slowly eats away at her, and after she's dismissed from her job as a Dame Teacher, she breaks down and flees to the Green Meadows, a secluded patch of beautiful crops and flowers. There a widowed Quaker named Hannah Tupper finds her and consoles her, and the two quickly become fast friends. As the Summer turns into Winter though, the townspeople quickly become ill, and Hannah Tupper and Kit are accused of bringing a plague into town, or inciting Witchcraft. Kit and Hannah must learn to survive among their Puritan neighbors and overcome adversity, while still being friends.<br /><br />Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br />Unlike the Amazon Review reads, I DO NOT recommend this novel to anyone under 11 or 12, as they may have a tough time getting through this novel. With that out of the way, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', while being Historical Fiction, actually lets the reader imagine a time and a place unlike ours at all, when Satin dresses were considered unorthedox and Jack-O-Laterns \\"of the devil\\". Speare effectively transports the reader back into the lifestyle and the mindset of the Late 1600's, and following Kit through her troubles is actually surprisingly entertaining and enthralling, and I was positively waiting for what would happen next. Speare, unlike fellow \\"classic\\" writers doesn't bog down her writing and plot with lengthy and unneeded descriptions, likewise focusing on the plot yet using colorful language at the same time. On the down side, the plot is incredibly predictable and (at times) repetitive, but I won't take away any points because I felt this was a great novel for Teens.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' easily bested my expectations for the novel, and I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed a Historical-Fiction novel. Speare is a good writer and storyteller, and I wouldn't mind reading another novel of hers in the future. Of five Summer Reading novels, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' has BY FAR been the best.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF DRAMA AND ADVENTURE. THIS NOVEL IS SUITABLE FOR ANY AGES(EVEN ADULTS!), BUT I RECOMMEND THE READER BE OVER 10 AS THE WRITING MAY CONFUSE THEM OR BORE THEM.

A Recent Andrew Clement's Novel.<br /><br /> Throughout Popular Culture, invisibility has been a popular subject, first being thought up in H.G. Well's 'The Invisible Man' and since then countlessly put into text. So it's no surprise that Andrew Clements, whose novel 'Frindle', with its offbeat plot and humor broke waves in The New York Times Bestseller List, decided to take a stab at the possibility of invisibility. Being a Summer Reading novel for me, I came into the book thinking it would be an interesting enough read, if it was anything like 'Frindle'. So, is 'Things Not Seen' a rehashed invisibility novel or a surprisingly good kid's novel? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Plot-<br /><br /> Bobby Phillips is your average 15 year old, except for one thing- He's invisible! He unknowingly wakes up one day and notices he has no reflection, so he approaches his parents, and they too are amazed at this unorthedox happening. Bobby's father, who's a Physicist, tries to think of how to cure him, while his mother simply mopes around the house. Bobby, on the other hand, takes it in stride, and uses his free time to watch TV, Sleep, and walk around in the nude all over town. One day at the Library, he meets a blind girl named Alicia, and he immediately befriends her and confides in her about his invisibility. Whilst Bobby learns to deal with his newfound invisibility, his 3 week abscense from school begins to be noticed, and Bobby must find a way to become visible again before dire consequences are levelled against his family...<br /><br /> Writing/Opinion/Etc.-<br /><br /> I'd like to quote some reviews of 'Things Not Seen' and respond to them:<br /><br /> &quot;A readable, thought-provoking tour-de-force, alive with stimulating ideas, hard choices, and young people discovering bright possibilities ahead&quot;<br /><br /> -Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review<br /><br /> Readable? The only way I could get through these poorly-written and boring pages was the fact that I had to read it. Thought-provoking? Does that mean 'Things Not Seen' gives us deep thoughts about the dangers of electric blankets(I'm serious, this is a main plot idea) or invisibility? It was about as thought-provoking as reading your palm lines. Alive with stimulating ideas? Wait a second, hasn't the whole invisibility plot been replayed so much to the point of tedium? Indeed, yet Clements only makes it more tedious drudging through his drab, boring writing. Hard choices? 'Things Not Seen' has tough choices like &quot;Should I search the globe for other invisible people?&quot; or &quot;Do double-negatives make a positive?&quot;. Stupid.<br /><br /> Now for my critique-<br /><br /> Andrew Clements is a fairly gifted writer and able to make a plot that's believeable and humorous at the same time, much like his novel 'Frindle' showed. Now let's take 'Things Not Seen' for instance. This is your typical invisibility story, where, for some odd reason, a person turns invisible for no reason, yet Clements, unlike other authors, chooses to let the story flow as if Bobby is acting out his normal life. For instance, for 2/3 of the novel, we read about Bobby doing everyday stuff, like watching TV, Reading, Making PB&J sandwiches, etc., etc. As you can imagine, it's EXTREMELY BORING! Clements tries to make the plot more bearable by getting Bobby's parents in a car wreck and him befriending a blind girl, yet these sub-plots just drag the plot more, and to the reader's misery add about 100 pages. Undoubtedly the worst thing about 'Things Not Seen' though was its terrible, horrifyingly bad plot twist at the end, where the reader learns that Bobby was turned invisible by an electric blanket...........AN ELECTRIC BLANKET?!?!? What was Clements thinking! Sorry to spoil the ending, but building up your hopes will only disappoint you more. Also, the way Bobby turns himself visible is also completely stupid and predictable, and it's one of the worst endings I've ever had the displeasure of reading! Clements also loads 'Things Not Seen' with tons of technical jargon, which I, and much less children, will have a fun time understanding. On the plus side, Children between 8-10 might enjoy this book, as its simple, yet stupid plot and 3rd Grade grammar appeal to that age group.<br /><br /> Overall, 'Things Not Seen' is a poorly written, a rehashed idea for a novel, and a plot that rivals watching the grass grow for boredom. This was an extremely disappointing read, and the only reason I read past page 100 was I HAD TO for Summer Reading. I give it two stars because it's not the worst thing I've ever read, and it's highly likely some kids will enjoy it(Just look at the other Kid's Reviews).<br /><br /> NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU'RE BETWEEN 8-10 YEARS OLD!

I give it two stars because it's not the worst thing I've ever read, and it's highly likely some kids will enjoy it(Just look at the other Kid's Reviews). <br />  <br /> NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU'RE BETWEEN 8-10 YEARS OLD! 'THINGS NOT SEEN' IS AN INCREDIBLY BORING AND POORLY WRITTEN NOVEL!  <br />  <br /> Recommended Instead- <br />  <br /> Frindle- Andrew Clements <br /> The Ersatz Elevator- Lemony Snicket <br /> Harry Potter And The Sorceror of Secrets- J.K.

Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher's First Novel Collaboration, and the First Novel In The &quot;Fire-Us&quot; Series.<br /><br /> In my predictable Summer Reading List chockful of big-name authors, I saw 'The Kindling', a novel I'd never heard of, so I decided to give it a chance. Like so many novels before it, 'The Kindling' chronicles the after-affects of the End of the World, may it be by Nuclear War or Plague, and we find the lone survivors banding together to remake Human Civilization. But, the question arises, does 'The Kindling' offer anything new to the table, or is a rehashed 'End of the World' novel we've already read twice before? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Plot-<br /><br /> In 2007, In Lazarus, Florida, 7 survivors dwell in the aftermath of the 'Fire-Us' plague. 'Fire-Us' wiped out all the adults on Earth, and the kids, left alone and neglected, mostly died out without supervision, but a select few banded together and learned to survive without Electricity and everyday appliances. We meet Mother and Teacher, two teenage girls who look after the little children such as Doll, Baby, Teddy Bear. Also, Action Figure and Hunter hunt down food and water for the sole survivors. For five years, the young group of children have survived on their own, leading a predictable life of feasting off of old supermarkets and the land, but their food supply is running low. But,just as their about to start really worring about their supplies,a knock on their door will change everything, and the person behind the door will take them on a journey that will test their strength and their friendship.<br /><br /> Writing/Opinion/Etc.-<br /><br /> 'The Kindling', while following the basic approach to 'End of the World' novels, has some individuality because it uses children instead of adults, and Armstrong/Butcher's take on a child's reaction and interaction with a destroyed world is quite interesting. The writing here is pretty straightforward, with getting the story out being more of interest to the author's than writing techniques, but that's fine since this is a book for Young Adult's anyways. Also, the authors did a great job of fleshing out the characters, and the reader learns to love the characters, and it's quite addictive to follow them on their quest. My only problem with the novel is that it doesn't really pick up until about 100 pages in, and the first few pages don't seem quite as well-written, but once you get past that, it's an enthralling read from start to finish, and I'd be interested in reading the other books since this one leaves you at a rather big climax.<br /><br /> Overall, 'The Kindling' is a solid read for Teens and Children(Over 8), and it's one of those popcorn novels, that reads like a movie, and ends with you on the edge of your seat. I'm encouraged to read the other novels in the 'Fire-Us' series, because the climax you're left at almost forces the reader to!<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED TO YOUNG ADULTS, CHILDREN, FANS OF 'END OF THE WORLD' NOVELS, AND ADVENTURE NOVELS.

Cornelia Funke's First Novel.<br /><br /> Around the time when J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels and Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortuneate Events were ruling the Children's Book Charts, Cornelia Funke's 'The Thief Lord' made a surprise splash on The New York Times Bestseller List, and even recieved &quot;School Library Journal&quot; and &quot;Parenting Magazine&quot;'s Book of the Year Award, so I've always wanted to read this novel, and since it was added onto my Summer Reading List, I actually read a book I wanted to read! So, is 'The Thief Lord' an excellent Teen Novel, or an overrated jumble of words? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Plot-<br /><br /> Deep in the alleys and canals of Venice, Italy, two runaway brothers, Prosper and Bo, seek shelter in an Abandoned movie theater, where they meet fellow runaways Riccio, Mosca, Hornet, and the Thief Lord. The Thief Lord leads a mysterious life of theft, and with his stealing cares for the runaways, even though he's not much older than them himself. Meanwhile, Bo and Prosper's Aunt(They were adopted by her after their mother's death) hires Victor Getz, a Private Detective, to track Bo and Prosper down. Soon after this, The Thief Lord is assigned to bring back a mysterious Wooden Wing, and to steal it from unknowing Ida Spavento. Just before the heist, Victor Getz tracks Bo and Prosper down in the abandoned Movie Theater, but he's quickly subdued by the children and locked in the theater's bathroom. Then, he tells Prosper that Scipio(The Thief Lord) isn't actually a mysterious nomadic thief, but an aristocratic son of millionare Dottor Massimo. Prosper and Co. investigate, and to their dismay they find this to be true, and they disown their friendship from him, since they learn he's actually been stealing his parent's riches. But as the Big Heist approaches, after Scipio and Prosper steal the Lion's Wing, they will be thrust into a world beyond their comprehension, and they will unlock its secrets.<br /><br /> Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br /> Since Cornelia Funke's 'The Thief Lord' was written in a foreign language, and had to be translated into English, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it in no way effected the dialogue, which was a concern for me coming into the novel. Once the story opens up, we're introduced to vivid descriptions of Venice's beautiful cityscape, and also are thrown into an interesting cat-and-mouse game between Prosper, Bo, and Victor Getz, which kept me on seat's edge for the first 100 pages or so. I would have liked the novel to continue like this, but unfortuneatly, once Getz is captured, Funke adds in a mysterious Fantasy aspect of the story, a direct homage to Ray Bradbury's 'Something Wicked This Way Comes'(Think of Merry-Go-Round's), which, while not a bad thing, definitely didn't interest me as much, and seemed like a plain and predictable plot twist, which it was. Also, other than Bo and Prosper's characters, I felt that Funke didn't flesh the characters out enough, and in the end, you really don't get the feeling that you even care about the characters.<br /><br /> Overall, 'The Thief Lord' was what I expected it to be, which is a typical novel for Teens and Young Adults, featuring a decent, but understandably predictable plot. Also, the plot's interest desperately drops off mid-way through the novel, as the Cat-And-Mouse game Funke makes you think is the Main Plot, which is enthralling, is oddly taken apart and replaced with a slightly more boring plot. A Good Novel, that while it's not really bad in many aspects, certainly isn't great either.<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED TO TEENS, CHILDREN(OVER 8), FANS OF CORNELIA FUNKE, AND FANS OF FANTASY/ADVENTURE. ALL THAT I EXPECTED, NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS, 4 STARS DESERVED.<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Inkheart- Cornelia Funke<br /><br /> Harry Potter 5- The Order Of the Phoenix- J.K.

Stephen King's 23rd Novel.<br /><br /> If you are a fan of Stephen King(AKA &quot;Constant Readers&quot;), 'Insomnia' is a book that you either love, or you hate. There is absolutely no middle-ground. I was wary of reading this for a long time because more than a few people told me it was so boring they couldn't get past the first 100 pages. But there were a select few who said that it was a masterpiece, a mixture of Fantasy and Horror with dazzling results. Connected very heavily with the Dark Tower Series(Which I haven't read yet), 'Insomnia' interested me, so I decided to pick it up against the recommendations of many people. Like it or not, 'Insomnia' was a huge success, hitting #1 on the New York Times Book List, and staying there for quite a while. So, is 'Insomnia' a frail attempt at fantasy that bores the reader to death, or is it an underrated masterpiece? If you ask me, it's an underrated masterpiece, and Read on to find out why!<br /><br /> Plot-<br /><br /> After the death of his beloved with Carolyn, Ralph Roberts begins to have symptoms of insomnia. Each day the insomnia seems to get worse, yet he neglects to see a doctor. Then, to his disbelief, Ralph begins to see things, things not of this world. People on the streets have &quot;Auras&quot; and &quot;Balloon Strings&quot;(Lifelines), and Ralph thinks it is all a delusion from his insomnia. Meanwhile, controversial feminist and pro-abortionist Susan Day is persuaded to come to Derry to speak on behalf of Derry's Women Health's Care Center and Abortion Clinic called WomanCare, and many people are VERY unhappy about this. One of those persons is Ed Deepanau, Ralph's former friend and neighbor, but lately his enemy, as he beat his wife to a pulp and hired somebody to kill Ralph &quot;because he was meddling&quot;, and he warned Ralph of the Bald Doctors and the Crimson King. Ralph takes these warnings as delusions from a madman, but late one night, at his neighbor Mary Locher's house, he notices two figures standing outside her house, two Bald people with doctor's smocks on, and scissors in one hand. Soon after this occurance, Ralph is thrust into a quest that will determine the lives of over 2,000 people, and even his life.......<br /><br /> Writing/Opinions/Etc.-<br /><br /> 'Insomnia' was the first Stephen King book I'd read with Fantasy elements or connections to The Dark Tower, so I was very interested in getting to read it, and ultimately I'm glad I did. King writes about a dimension behind the vision of most humans, but a select few can see it, and the horrors of death and the afterlife are plausibly explored in King's prose, and in turn, it seems so real it's actually very scary. Although many times the plot seemed a tad odd, I easily followed the story, and I was hooked! I can't imagine why anybody would think this was boring, as from page 1 to page 760, King serves up a Fantasy/Horror classic that hooked me in with its brilliant plot and idealogy and kept me guessing up until the climactic ending(The end is very much 9/11, and this was written in '94). It's funny how King can make such ludicrus happenings seem SO real, but his writing effectively did so!<br /><br /> Overall, 'Insomnia' was a terrific great, and definetively lived up to my highest expectations! King effectively writes a Horror/ Fantasy classic, and this really encourages me to delve into his Dark Tower series!<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF STEPHEN KING, HORROR, FANTASY, SCI-FI, DRAMA! 'INSOMNIA' HAS A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY, THOUGH I DON'T HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO STEPHEN KING NEWBIES, AS ITS LENGTH AND PLOT MAY SEEM OVERDONE!

US	30977056	R7LGBWLNMCE6G	0451177096	252564915	Dolores Claiborne	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Compelling Look Into What Drives a Person To Kill.......	Dolores Claiborne(1993). Stephen King's 22nd Novel, Published Simultaneously With Gerald's Game.<br />Between the Late 80's and Early 90's, Stephen King was hard at work with the novels &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. He originally concieved them to be issued in a Two-Volume Set Entitled &quot;In The Path Of The Eclipse&quot; because of the similarities. Both main characters experience Total Solar Eclipses, and for one moment in both stories, are bonded. Both novels portray plotlines about Child Abuse, And Learning to live with the Horrors of your Past. Both Novels stand as some of Stephen King's most ambitious, but &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; is more so. A startling confession of the human mind, and the reasons that drive people to murder, present themselves in their full glory in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;'s unending narrative(It has NO chapters or paragraphs), and it is a compelling read from start to finish. In Usual Fashion, &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; and &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; claimed the #1 Spot each, and both stand as some of Stephen King's deepest novels, dealing with the demons inside of us and from the past. &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; has been made into a successful and emotional movie, Starring Cathy Bates(Star of &quot;Misery&quot;). Read On To Find Out Why &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; stands as one of King's strongest novels.<br />Plot-<br />After the mysterious death of Vera Donavon, Longtime Housekeeper Dolores Claiborne is accused of pushing her down the stairs. As she goes in for a Police Interragation, Dolores decides to relate all of the misdeeds in her past. She tells the police that she never killed Vera Donavon, but she did murder her husband over 30 years ago. What follows is her compelling testimony of her troubled past, and what drove her to kill her husband, and most importantly, Why she did. We also learn of her deep friendship with Vera Donavan, and their troubled yet very loving relationship. Dolores relates everything about her past, and in her testimony, irrecovable sins are revealed, relationships are made and torn, and the horrors of the past are revealed in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;.<br />Writing-<br />Stephen King's writing in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; is undoubtedly the most original I've ever read. Why, you ask? Mainly because the entire story is a narrative from a Police Interragation, and we read through the records taken at the interrogation. The reader learns everything of her past through Dolores Claiborne's &quot;Yankee&quot; drawl and slurred speech. While it takes a little while to get used to it, by the end of the novel, the unfinished words, the slurred words, and the made-up words seem completely natural, and the narrative flows quicker than most books I've read for THAT reason. Since there are NO chapters and NO Paragraph, the reader is almost FORCED to read &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; in one sitting, and I must say, that's not Hard At All! I found myself reading for about 4-5 hours straight just to finish &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, and you will undoubtedly do so to. In years to come, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; will be recognized as one of King's best, as it doesn't focus on &quot;outward&quot; horror(Such as Evil Clowns, Possessed Dogs, or Evil Cars), but instead, focuses on the horror(or evil) inside of us all.<br />Overall, I found &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; to be an excellent triumph for Stephen King, as his unstopped and troublesome narrative is sure to influence other such books with it's magnificence. Although &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; isn't scary, it fully makes up for it with its Mystery, so any &quot;Constant Reader&quot; of Stephen King is sure not to be disappointed.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! FANS OF STEPHEN KING AND MYSTERIES WILL HIGHLY ENJOY &quot;DOLORES CLAIBORNE&quot;.

US	30977056	RCX88Q96SV5OT	0451167317	877287899	The Dark Half	Books	5	3	4	N	N	The Sparrows Are Flying Again; A Tense Mental Thriller	The Dark Half(1989). Stephen King's Nineteenth Novel.<br />In many ways, 'The Dark Half' is King at his most personal, and his most revealing. As any of his &quot;Constant Readers&quot; know, he wrote under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman for many years. Richard Bachman, very much like Thad Beaumont's Dark Half, was in many ways, Stephen King's Dark Half, where the world was in a state of pessimism, and the endings were never happy. So, in many ways, Stephen King's alternate personality is the direct inspiration for this book, Richard Bachman being in direct relation to George Stark, a pessimistic alternate personality of Thad Beaumont. The Dark Half has gone on to become one of Stephen King's most admired novels of the 80's, right along novels such as IT, The Talisman, and Misery.It is one of his most memorable, telling the reader a grisly fact they will never forget: 1 Out of Every 10 Women have twins, but one of them sucks up the other In Utero. At its time of release, The Dark Half debuted at #1 on the New York Times List, and showed Stephen King's popularity was fully intact, and gave him his Ninth Bestseller. The Dark Half was also made into a movie, and it still stands as one of the best. Read on for my review of The Dark Half-<br />Plot-<br />Thad Beaumont, Husband of Liz Beaumont, and Father of Two Twins(Liz and Wendy), appears appears to be normal to the outside world, a humble Writing Professor and a Novelist(Popular with critics, but poorly selling), living his life alone with his family in Ludlow without a care in the world. But he has a secret, that few people know about, and that secret is that he is George Stark, Bestselling Author of  Dark Grisly Thrillers, Thad Beaumont's Alternate Personality, or in this case, his Dark Half. Thad, after being blackmailed, decides once and for all to put George Stark to rest, because when Thad is Stark, he isn't himself, but a half-crazed writer. So amidst heavy press, Thad Beaumont tells the world that HE is George Stark, and that George Stark is dead. Thad Beaumont's quiet life is turned upside down when his part-time Handyman, Homer Gamache, was found beaten to death, with his fingerprints all over the Crime Scene. Thad doesn't know what to think, and soon his past will come back to haunt him. Early in his life, Thad Beaumont suffered headaches, and finally a convulsion(Brought on by the sound of sparrows), and doctors discovered and removed an eyeball and two fingernails from his brain, the leftovers of his would-be twin. Police are baffled at Thad's case, because he had alibis the night of the murder to attest he was at a party, and they learn more murders(Of people Thad knew) have taken place in New York, with fingerprints of Thad included, but Thad wasn't possibly there. So, along with the help of Sheriff Pangborn, Thad sets out to unmask his silent killer, and he begins to think that maybe it is the person he once killed: George Stark. As Stark inches nearer and nearer to Thad, he and his family's life will come down to his bravery, and if he can defeat his Dark Half.<br />Writing/Opinions-<br />The Dark Half, much like Stephen King's Gerald Game, centers around Stephen King's ability to tell a story, and focuses less on Writing Mechanics. Although there are subtle similes/metaphors here and there, unlike many of his novels, grisly and humorous descriptions are the main draw here, and his descriptions of Sparrows might make you think twice about going near them. He tells the story straight out, and unlike &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; or &quot;IT&quot;, King doesn't care about side-plots, he focuses his story on Thad and George Stark, and the reader is enthralled every page from the mysterious beginning to the macabre end, and it is impossible to put this book down. In many ways, this is a Thriller, but towards the end of the novel, Stephen King reverts to his Horror ends, and his Disturbing End might give Fainthearted readers a sleepless night. I must remark how TheDark Half, unlike many of his novels, has an ending that PERFECTLY complements the plot, and I found myself smiling at King's carefully plotted ending, reveling in Horror's King's cleverness.<br />Overall, I found The Dark Half to be an excellent read, enthralling and mysterious, and hard to put down. After reading the dissapointing &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, &quot;The Dark Half&quot; really showed that Stephen King, while he has his lows, always has his undeniable highs.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Something Wicked This Way Comes(1962).<br />Ray Bradbury, author of such renound classics as The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451, took a stab at the horror genre in 1962. Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and  have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!<br />Plot- <BR>During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...<br />Writing-<BR>Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way Comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down.Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me. <br />Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as many authors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A GREAT HORROR AND CLASSIC NOVEL NOT TO BE<BR>MISSED BY ANYONE!

Much like Mary Shelley(Frankenstein) and Bram Stoker(Dracula), Ray Bradbury helped in the shaping of the Horror genre, now ruled by such authors as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Combining Horror and Classical Literature, with a plot of Greed and Deception, Bradbury created what today would be known as a Horror Classic, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and also one of the most recognizeable novels in his catalog. Bradbury was the first Horror author to use children, the most unlikely heroes, that Stephen King later used in his commercial smash IT and his short story \\"The Body\\", and lods have been used by numerous other authors and directors of popular culture. Based on a famous quote of Shakespeare, Something Wicked This Way spawned a popular movie of its own, and Modern Day Metal Artist Iced Earth even used it for the title of their popular album. In the next paragraphs, you will read just what made Something Wicked This Way Comes such a timeless classic, and one of the very few classics I can stand!<br />Plot-<br />During the time before Halloween, in the cold Autumn of October, a Train seemingly spawned out of hell comes into town, a dark omen of the days ahead. As a calliope crackles mysterious doomy tunes, Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a carnival of sorts, unloads their dark materials, tents, animals, and sideshow freaks of equal gruesomeness. Jim Nightshade and Will Holloway, two young curious 12 Year old boys, seemingly are the only ones to hear the hellish calliope(FYI, an organ) music at Three in the Morning, so they set out to see where all the noise is coming from. Soon they find out, and flee back to their homes to await the coming storm. The next day, The Carnival is out in full force, and most of the entire town is there, to view such rides and shows as A Mirror Maze, a Ferris Wheel, seeing Skeleton Men, Dwarfs, Fortune Tellers, Mr. Electro, and Mr. Dark, the Amazing Illustrated Man. Their is also a Merry-Go-Round, but it is strangely Out of Order. After the crowd leaves and the carnival shuts down, the crowds subsided totally and all is quiet, Jim and Will stay behind, hiding, waiting to learn the mystery of the carnival. Soon they are thrusted into a world where their wildest dreams are imaginable, and their worst nightmares are staring them right in the face, and they are the only ones who can subside the Growing Storm...<br />Writing-<br />Since this is my first Ray Bradbury novel I've read(And probably not the last), I won't compare Something Wicked This Way Comes to his other works, but instead rate his writings as my observations as a reader. The most memorable part of Bradbury's writing, is his descriptive writing, which, even such a simple act as running, Bradbury lets you Feel, Hear, See, Taste, and almost makes you think you can reach out and touch what isn't there. Although many times his descriptions run-on for too long, other times he hits the right notes in the right amount of space, and his genuine talent for writing and descriptions bring the story and the characters alive. Something Wicked This Way comes, along with Stoker's Dracular, is one of the few classics I can stand, because too much emphasis in other classics is placed on descriptions rather than plot, but Bradbury's plot is deftly place Center-Stage here, and the Reader never feels bored or let down. Many times his ideas may seem unreasonable, but against the other material it doesn't take too much away from the book to me.<br />Overall, Something Wicked This Way Comes left a strong impression on me for Bradbury, and this won't be the last book I read by him. If you noticed the 4 star rating, it's mostly because of the things that plague classics so much for me. Overlong descriptions. I must emphasize though Bradbury isn't nearly as inconsistent as manyauthors, so this is just minor. Also some of his plot ideas seem odd and leave the reader thinking \\"Huh?\\", but most of the time the plot is easy to follow.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A GREAT HORROR AND CLASSIC NOVEL NOT TO BE MISSED BY ANYONE! BRADBURY MAKES THE CARNIVAL SEEM MORE EVIL THAN IT DOES IN REAL LIFE!<br />(...)thors, so this is just minor.

As usual, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; shot to #1 on the New York Times Book charts, and it was met with great reviews, and bad reviews, but none of the fans took notice of the bad ones. In my review, I will give you a basic overview of the story(With no spoilers), and tell you how Stephen King's writing was, and how they mix overall. So was &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; one of Stephen King's strongest or a mixed bag? Read on to find out!<br />Story: After Johanna Noonan dies in the middle of a Parking Lot of a brain tumor, Mike Noonan's wife, popular author Mike Noonan is thrusted into a world where lonliness is his only friend and he is unable to write without breaking down. Soon the realization that his career was quickly dwindling because of his inability to write dawned on him, so he saught solace and peace for a new place to write, his fabled summerhouse Sara Laughs, named after the 1920's musicians Sara and the Redtops. Upon getting to Sara Laughs, Mike begins to hear weeping and crying noises during the night, and most horrifying, he begins to hear people scream. As he learns more and more of what's happened since he was gone, he learns that his wife(Nicknamed) Jo was down here without him knowing, and that she was planning to write a story about the TR's (Where Sara Laughs is located) illustrous history, and Mike begins trying to piece together what she found out and why she didn't tell him. Then, as if to answer Mike's lonliness, he stumbles on a girl walking down the middle of the street named Kyra. He then meets her beautiful mother Mattie after picking up Kyra of the Street(Out of the way of danger), Mike Noonan is unknowingly thrusted into a world of hell that he wanted no part of. Soon after that incident, Mike is questioned by local billionare and elder Max Devore about the incident, and Mike immediately feels apprehensive at the situation and angrily hangs up on him. He then learns that Max Devore has been trying to get custody of Kyra from her perfectly capable mother Mattie just because he wants her. Mike begins to feel a bond between Mattie and Kyra, and he devotes himself to helping her and letting her keep custody of Kyra. After hiring a lawyer and personally helping her with his own money, many people in town think that he's just buying out Mattie Devore, and they begin to be cold and heartless towards him. All the while, as Mike begins to dig up more information about the TR's past, he also uncovers more Ghosts of the past on his way. What ensues is a bitter battle between Mike Noonan and Max Devore for custody of Kyra, and it even cascades into a legal battle that may be deadly. As Mike ventures furthur into the TR's past, he's plagued by ghosts that are trying to keep him from the truth and will even kill to do so.<br />Writing: After writing so beautifully and creating such memorable plots with &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, Stephen King would undoubtedly create one of the most memorable stories ever, right? Well, yes.Yes, because it's most memorable for being one of his worst, because it's the most boring Stephen King book I've ever had to read. Although his writing is descriptive and professional enough, it seems to be lacking the inventiveness of such masterpieces as &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, and &quot;The Shining&quot;. While the writing might be interesting enough, the plot sadly isn't. For over 700 pages, we learn all about the TR's history and how it connects with the ghosts Mike is experiencing, but the reason for them is disjointed and idiotic, almost verging on the point that I almost stopped reading because the plot was so laughable. The book is fine for the first 600 pages, good if not a little boring, hence the 3 star rating, but the last 130 pages are incredibly stupid. When Mike finally discovers what Jo found out, it isn't surprising and it seems a little childish for a plot twist from such a great author as Stephen King. I was really disappointed with what eventually happened with Mattie and Kyra, and also dissappointed with the &quot;Ghost&quot; story behind the TR's past, and how dum the last 50 pages are.<br />Overall: For once, this was the first Stephen King book that genuinely bored me. For most of his books, I would finish them in about 2-3 days because I was so entranced with the story, but with this book, it took me a MONTH. The reason it did so was because I would frequently put the novel down because it was so tedious. The plot is good in the beginning, but the overall ending and explanation of all the loose ends was childish and not  reasonable. Although Stephen King writes horror/fiction and his novel's may be weird at times, his endings are never &quot;Stupid&quot; , which &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; unfortuneatly is.<br />RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR DIE-HARD STEPHEN KINGS. NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NOVEL WITH A GREAT PLOT. FOR THAT I WOULD HAVE TO RECOMMEND &quot;IT&quot;, &quot;NEEDFUL THINGS&quot;, &quot;THE SHINING&quot;, &quot;CUJO&quot;, OR PRETTY MUCH ANY NOVEL BUT &quot;BAG OF BONES&quot;. I'M A DIE-HARD STEPHEN KING FAN AND I WAS DISSAPOINTED, SO I'M AFRAID YOU MAY BE TOO. Thanks for reading!ugh, the plot sadly isn't.

After finishing Gerald's Game, I feel like I have just fallen out of the visionary world Stephen King has written, and anybody can journey to it by picking up this book. From start to finish, this is psychological terror at its best, and if a person was entranced as I was they could finish this book in about 2 days if they felt the need to, because the reader just has to know the outcome to the story or he would go insane waiting to see what happens. Although Gerald's Game deals with some very controversial subject matter, such as child abuse and sex, this book is not overshadowed by the mature subject matter. This was once in fact supposed to be a movie, but the producers had no idea how to show somebody topless for the entire movie without recieving an NC-17 rating, so they just dropped the whole movie idea. Here below is a quick overview of the story and the writing:<br />Story: As the novel opens, we meet timid Housewife Jessie Burlingame, who is still haunted by an accident from the past, and her husband, Gerald Burlingame, the curious husband who has a slight heart problem. Both of them are vacationing at their Lake House when Gerald decides to pull out his handcuffs and test them out on Jessie. Jessie is then handcuffed to both of the bedposts, with only 6 inches of armroom allowed. With Jessie still locked up and the keys all the way across the room, Gerald suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Jessie hopelessly handcuffed with no way to get out of the bed. As time passes, Gerald's body starts looking pretty scrumptious to a hungry stray, who ventures into the house and starts turning Gerald into Dogfood. All the while Jessie valiantly tries to get a water glass full of water off the shelf that is just barely out of her reach, but she has to try or else she fears she may just go insane. As her hunger and thirst deepens, Jessie begins having recurring dreams about her disturbing childhood that is tarnished by the memory of her father abusing her as a child. As she learns to deal with her inner demons, she soon notices demons aren't only in her dreams, but in the corner of her bedroom. A gaunt shadow stands there watching her throughout the night, and she realizes to her dismay the shadow is real. The only way Jessie can get out of her predicament is to overcome her inner demons and and try not to go mad, while at the same time she must figure out a way to get out of her impenetrable stronghold with all of her options gone except for an empty glass on the bedstand. Jessie learns to overcome fear and herself in the ultimate battle for survival.<br />Writing: Stephen King constantly amazes me at his always changing and everdevoloping writing styles, and with Gerald's Game, he once again he has done it. Although not as descriptive as say Cujo or The Shining, Gerald's Game describes things beautifully through similes and metaphors that are well-crafted and thought-out. What really amazes me about the writing is the relentlessness of the plot and how he sounds like the Camp Counselor telling ghost stories around the fire, increasing the tension and making you gasp once or twice for good measure. Stephen King is definitely writing in his \\"I Want to Tell You A Story\\" mode, never letting the plot lag and the story get muddled with needless subplots that have no basis.

US	30977056	R2CEJ0FUOJRCSY	0451161351	381306153	Cujo	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A Centerpiece in Stephen King's career	Cujo is one of the most memorable and well written novels Stephen King has written to this day. There are fond memories from everybody who has read the book or seen the movie of the Infamous Pinto scene, which stands as one of the most riveting scenes in any novel and the reader just sucks it up like a black hole. Many people read the novel after seeing the movie just to get to the Pinto scene, mostly missing all the carefully laid plot twists and intricate ironies that mask the characters in a macabre shadow. Minor points aside, Cujo stands as Stephen King's most fastpaced and well written novel to date, and therefore should be read by all, and remember, DOGS DO BITE!<br />Here's a summary of the Story and its Writing:<br />Story: Enter the Trentons, Donna, the lonely housewife who has just broken off an affair under rather nasty circumstances, Vic, the interminably busy ad maker whos Biggest client is envoloped in a fatal scandal, and Tad, The curious son who's just begun to see monsters in his closet. Then we see the Cambers, Joe, The auto mechanic with an attitude, his wife Charity, Who dreams of a better lifestyle, and their son Brett, the precosious youth who owns a rather large St. Bernard named Cujo. This is where the story really starts to pick up. Cujo in fact is one of the most tame dogs you could have the fortune of having, but after chasing a rabbit into an unforseen hole and being bitten by a cache of bats, Cujo starts to feel different. Cujo was in fact infected with rabies and the disease slowly starts to eat away his mind. The oldest person in town, Evvie Chalmers, predicts that the summer of '82 will be the hottest in 30 years. Vic Trenton's ad campaign for a cereal backfired after the cereal caused its consumers to vomit blood, and he has to quickly rush to New York to reassess his issues. Donnna Trenton puts a stop to her affair with Steve Kemp(Her Neighbor), but he has other ideas. He soon after mails Vic an anonymous letter making him aware of the affair. Depressed and belittled, Vic gratefully travels to New York to get away for awhile. Tad Trenton starts to see a monster in his closet more frequently, and that monster is itching to get out. Back with the Cambers, Charity Camber wins the lottery to her great surprise and plans to take her son Brett with her to Hartford, Connecticut to visit her sister and show her son a &quot;Better Lifestlyle&quot;. But before Brett leaves he notices that Cujo looked very sick, but he neglected to tell his father. Joe Camber, unhappy but agreeable to his wife and son's trip begins to plan a trip to Boston for himself and his best friend, the alcholic Gary Pervier, who is his next door neighbor, the only one for a few miles. After Vic Trenton's absense, Donna's brand new Pinto begins to act up, the needle valve apparently skewered, so she decides to take the car to the cheapest auto mechanic in town, Joe Camber(BAD IDEA). But beforehand, Cujo has been degraded to a mindless 250 pound mongrel hellbent on the thought of murder, and starts his killing spree by biting off Gary Pervier's throat and instantly killing him. The next day Joe Camber arrives at his friends house to find his dead friend and his worst nightmare, Cujo. He soon is made into lunch. By now, the Camber residense is totally deserted except for Cujo, and when Donna and Tad Trenton pull into the Camber's driveway in their fabled Pinto, Cujo's the first one they meet. It attacks and turns the Pinto into his own personal toy, and the people inside are it's puppets. The Pinto is unresponding and will not start up to Donna and Tad's dismay, and they are stuck for days under the watchful gaze of the insane and slowly dieing Cujo and under the sweltering sun of summer. Ultimately, the ultimate sacriface must be made for the survival of Donna, who saintly risks her life for her son but soon realizes he's already dead. Thus ends an Epic tale of irony and plot twists.<br />Writing: You can only describe the writing in this novel in one word: Breathtaking. You literally are held breathless and under the spell of King's writing, which forces you to read the novel in the course of 48 hours. His fastpaced prose and deftly laid plot twists and ironies astonish me in their careful planning and how they came out in the final product, and it is one of his most complex novels to date, a perfect choice for college reading teacher's studys. King is definitely in a Zone(The Dead Zone?Just Kidding) and tells the story in his I Want To Tell You A Story mode, unrelenting and never boring. He flexes his writing talents to the brink and shows us just how talented he really is. This is the best writing in any novel I've read of his SO FAR, encompassing The Shining or Needful Things, but I still hold an unsurpassable place set by The Green Mile. Great in every way possible, Cujo is remarkably polished and will be around for many years to come if justice is served.<br />Memorable Quote:&quot;The world is full of monsters, and they were all allowed to bite the innocent and the unwary&quot; Very Truethis novel in one word: Breathtaking.

US	30977056	R2BT6A6A7COU3E	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	5	0	0	N	N	&quot;Nobody was Really Surprised, Not really&quot;	In 1974, a struggling reading teacher and aspiring part-time author named Stephen King published his first and most integral novel in his career, because it let him write full-time and it devoloped one of the best fiction writers of the 20th century, and the name of that novel was Carrie. Originally written as a short story, King was for no apparent reason disgusted with Carrie and threw it away. And thankfully King's wife Tabitha later found the story and read it in one sitting, and in realizing its genuis she almost forced him to publish it. After publishing it, Stephen King was immediately offered a staggering 400,000 dollar movie deal, of which King kept half. And of course this put King into the spotlight and as an author to look out for, and it allowed him to write full-time. Carrie the movie devoloped into one of the most memorable horror movies of the 70's, equally competing with the likes of The Exorsist and Rosemary's Baby. Carrie is a novel that deals with the troubles of high school, teen anxiety, and a certain bucket of pig blood. Here's an overview of Carrie:<br />Story: As the novel opens, we meet humble Carrie White, who battles constantly with being an outcast and dealing with her mother's extreme religious beliefs. After an unfortunate hazing accident in the locker's showers, caused by fellow classmates Chris Hargensed and Sue Snell, Carrie begins to hate her classmates and even more her mother, who is the prime example of a way overprotective mother. Carrie then takes a week off and begins to discover powers she barely knew she had, a kind of telekinesis that is passed down through generations and allows the user the all-powerful ability to distort objects to her will just by thinking. During her break, Sue Snell and Chris Hargensen are punished by having to go to a session of detention, and if they refuse to go, the school will withhold their prom tickets. Sue Snell, filling pity for Carrie and deeply sorry for what she's done, agrees to the detention, while the school miscreant Chris Hargensen refuses her detention, and is of course disallowed to the all-important prom. Sue still feeling sorry for Carrie makes her boyfriend(School Heartthrob,yada yada) Tommy Ross take Carrie to the prom, while Chris makes her boyfriend get a bucket of pig blood and place it above the Prom King and Queen throne, already knowing that Carrie and Tommy will win. Come Prom Night, Carrie is having the time of her life and for the first time in her life she feels accepted, And even more amazing to her, she is crowned Prom Queen. But upon reaching the throne, Chris Hargensen dumps a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Carrie, enraged and feeling betrayed by her classmates, begins to use her powers to burn down the gym, with her classmates trapped inside, and continues to wreak havoc throughout the entire town, burning it like a dry leaf. And the last person Carrie kills is her mother, and she makes her heart go &quot;Slower and slower&quot; until it reaches a &quot;Full stop&quot;. That night was from then on known as The Black Prom, and over 600 people died.<br />Writing: Although this is the one of the shortest novels Stephen King has written, it is one of his more complex and most thoughtful books to date. He shows what its like to be under the constant control of an unwanted mother and how it can affect somebody. He really makes the reader feel for Carrie, at first pitying for her and then in a macabre sort of way, rooting for her as she gives her classmates what they deserve. King is clever in his use of paragraphs, as he infuses (Fake) news articles, essays, book excerpts, and even a phony death certificate to make the story all the more plausible and use up the space between paragraphs. King's writing is fast-paced and relentless, never taking a break and almost forcing the reader to finish the novel in one sitting(I did). He cleverly uses similes and metaphors in his writing that are at times hilarious or phantasmaghoric. Kingreally lets the reader believe in Telekinesis too, through his use of essays and examples of telekinetic happenings, and you get a tingle out of it. All in all, Stephen King writes Carrie as if he's been doing it all of his life, not his first novel.Carrie is a fast paced thrill-ride from start to finish and I recommend it to everybody.really lets the reader believe in Telekinesis too, through his use of essays and examples of telekinetic happenings, and you get a tingle out of it.

After Stephen King released his classic novel The Shining, His Constant Readers were yearning for more, and they got their wish with The Stand. Although Mr. King was early on pigeonholed into the certain genre of horror, he showed he could flex his fingers and create a book so profound its hard to place it in a certain genre(But it still says Horror on the side of the book)). People gobbled up this new novel and it turned out to be his 1st #1 Bestseller(The first of many), surging him to the forefront of popularity and earning respect from his peers. Most critics hailed it as an epic novel and said it was basically An Idiot's Guide To The End of The World, while some critics(Namely Spider Robinson) abhorred this book and urged others to boycott it. But Over Time, People figured out Spider Robinson was an idiot, end of story(I mean, how many people have an insect everybody hates as their 1st name). Many fans hail this novel as Stephen King's greatest and most epic novel, his most imaginative and profound novel, and his most heartfelt and most realistic novel, and stuck in a blender you get one great book. Although The Stand was originally missing over 150,000 words from the manuscript, Stephen King re-released The Stand uncut 12 years later, adding new locales and characters, and further deepening our perspective of all the previous characters. Also one other note, ABC made a 6 Hour TV Miniseries out of The Stand(Starring Teen Idol Molly Ringwald) and I have heard its quite good and very true to the book. Here's an overview of the story and the writing of The Stand(Dont worry about Spoilers, I'm not giving anything away):<br />Story: Imagine the Government has Secretly made a superflu virus that is capable of wiping out 99.4% of the population in direct violation of The Geneva Code and imagine the disease leaking out and slowly infecting the entire population of the earth with a disease that is impossible to cure. Even after millions of death, the government still denies any involvement in the superflu, all the way to their graves. Whole cities are totally deserted and the scattered survivors search for others with diminishing hope. Soon the survivors begin to have dreams, One of an 108 year old black woman named Mother Abigail, and another of A man shrouded in darkness and evil, named Randall Flagg. People from around The United States begin to flock towards one or the other figures in their dreams, Mother Abagail, a symbol of Love and Hope, or Randall Flagg, a symbol of evil and oppresion. The heroes of the book go to Mother Abagail in Boulder, Colorado, where they form a quaint community and try to rebuild their former lives. All the other people(Mostly criminals and egoists) flock to Randall Flagg in Las Vegas, where people who go out of line are crucified or worse. The Denizens of Boulder live in constant fear of The Dark Man and his plans of world domination, so they prepare for an impending attack from Randall Flagg's followers. Before Mother Abagail passes away to live with her all-important God, she sends 3 of our heroes to Las Vegas to make a last stand against evil. Stu Redman, Glen Bateman, Ralph Brentner, Larry Underwood, and the dog Kojak risk their lives on the faith that God will prevail with them and defeat Randall Flagg.<br />Writing: Stephen King's writing starts off very placidly in the first 500 pages with his descriptions of the plague and its aftermath, briskly showing the Readers whats inside of his head. His writing can be very interesting and very inane at times throughout the first 500 pages, but once you hit 500 and meet Mother Abagail for the first time, Stephen King's prose seems to be miracurously changed for the better, as there are no boring moments and he writes with a flourish that can be found in novels like The Shining. Even though the book is a massive 1141 pages (In SUPER-SMALL print!) I wanted the book to be longer, as I thought some of the plots were unfinished. Stephen King really lets his readers feel for his characters, may it be pity, contempt, love or hatred, as he carefully molds his characters personas and devolops them throughout the novel. King imaginatively shows what peoples reactions to the End of the world would be and what they would do, and that makes the book even more plausible. But one major flaw that keeps nagging at me is the fact of how Randall Flagg is finally defeated, as the reader gets the impression the heroes are setting out on a quest of magic and faith, but instead they all die in a spur of the moment blast. I felt King could have tried harder on the ending.<br />Bottom Line: I do not recommend this book to any people trying to get into Stephen King because of its length and overall complexity, but it is a very good addition to any King fans collection. This book gets 4 out of 5 stars only because of the at times flawed writing and the rather unremarkable ending.

This novel is a loosely based purging of Stephen King's thoughts about his fans, and he weaves a novel out of that that is inexplicably excellent. After releasing The Tommyknockers, Stephen King had this book published in 1988 to rave reviews and massive fanfare, and was even made into an Academy Award Winning movie 2 years later(Think about a tight schedule). Stephen King's vivid descriptions of Paul Sheldon's misery and his insane captor Anne Wilkes make this book stand as one of his strongest and happens to be one of his most popular books. Great for people trying to get into Stephen King.<br />Story:<br />Our story revolves around writer Paul Sheldon, who like The Shining's Jack Torrance is buried in the harsh Colorado winter. After a brutal Car wreck, Paul is Saved by his Number One Fan, The Former Nurse Anne Wilkes(There's a reason she's a former nurse), who nurses him back to health after he attains some ghastly injuries. As soon as Paul comes back to The Living, he learns that Anne Wilkes is a SERIOUS Fan of his Misery novels, romances of a sort. Paul is mortally afraid of Annie, as he has already figured she's insane, and he prepares for her to crack. And boy, does she ever. She begins by making him burn a novel(Fast Cars, She apparently didn't like it) that he has worked on for the past 2 years, giving him the Choice of either getting his pain to go away or burning his manuscript. Then, upon learning that Paul killed off Misery Chastain in his new novel, she MAKES him write a new one, and the choice is simple:If he writes it, he lives, and if he doesn't, he dies. This is how Stephen King haunts people, folks. But he begins to find solace in his writing and it is the one thing that keeps him from going insane.As Annie's bad mood progresses, she becomes more depressed and demanding, and will do anything to get Paul to obey her. Holding his pain medication and cutting off parts of his body are just 2 of her methods. As Paul uncovers her shocking path he is likewise set on a path to revenge that will end in either his death or Annie's  .They're are many road bumps in store for Paul, and he must get over them so his story will be told.  The story is impecable and majestic to be saying the least.<br />Writing:<br />Stephen Kings prose screams off the page with its dark and twisted humor and terrifying descriptions that make you need to get under a blanket, you're shivering so badly. It's almost as if King lived in the world of Paul Sheldon, because his desriptions of Paul's thoughts and his apprehension at Annie put you directly into his mind. I also like how King had a story within a story(Kind of like The Regulators the Movie screenplay in The Regulators), as we Constant Readers get to read chapters of Paul Sheldon's new special Annie Wilkes novel, Misery's Return. It's kind of cool to read 2 different stories at once, and learning how Sheldon's writing process works.I also love the metaphors this novel has, Like how writing Is Paul's Africa, a place where he can escape to. Also the metaphor of how Annie Wilkes is The Goddess, because of her impenatreble stronghold on Paul. The story never seems to lag or get haggled in boring chapters, as the story is just straight up action through 338 pages. The only thing that sticks out like a thorn to me is that the ending seems to be really rushed, like King was trying to reach a deadline(Like Paul) or he just wanted to get the novel over with. Overall, his writing is not at his peak (Like in The Shining or Needful Things), but its a close second. Great.<br />Bottom Line, if you're a potential buyer who wants to read a great book or discover a new author, just buy this book and thank me later by saying this review was helpful to you.<br />  The Circle Closesmethods.

I thought Needful Things was hilarious!!&quot; Sadistic, eh? But I have to agree with Mr. King, because I just loved the town's (Castle Rock) slow descent to madness, and its inevitable destruction. Even though not a drop of blood is spilled till almost page 300, you are hooked from the beginning of the book, where you meet Leland Gaunt, the Proprieter of Needful Things (a store with all your heart's desires, at only the price of your soul and to play a &quot;little&quot; trick on one of your fellow townsmen) till the chaotic destruction of Castle Rock, one of Stephen King's most memorable locales, home to the stories &quot;Cujo&quot;,&quot;The Dark Half&quot; and the excellent short story &quot;The Body&quot;. This book is also superbly written with King's haunting metaphors and spine-tingling characters that scratch at your back, but strangely the last 50 pages or so seem to be not as well written in some of the action sentences, but that dosen't mean the ending isn't good. Also, I think King did a good job of keeping the plethora of characters in order, as SK managed to tell ALL.. the characters' stories without the plot falling apart, and I applaud him for that. Congratulations Mr.King, you have crafted an excellent story that stays with the reader after he finished it, and once again you have entertained me. Also the end was strikingly funny and sadistic to me (The VERY END) and topped off what was to me, a very Needful Thing in my Stephen King collection	2004-02-21
US	30977056	R268BBCW4UU8M	0743424425	966329377	The Shining	Books	5	4	4	N	N	REDRUM!	Stephen King has been foremostly labeled &quot;The King of Horror&quot; for much of his adult life, and in this book he vividly tells us why. It is not so much as visual horror as it is mental, seeing the down-and-out writer Jack Torrance's slow ascension into insanity, which King vividly describes and perpetuates. Reading this book is like slipping into the Overlook yourself, as King tells the characters' stories through his superb writing and vivid imagination. The pages seem to fly by your eyes without a whim, your brain just sucking up the story like a vacuum, and once you reach the &quot;explosive&quot; end, you may be wishing for more. Also, I'd like to make a point to all of those who have seen the movie but have not read the book, as the movie misses many of the critical plot points of the book. They only got a few scenes right, such as the woman in the tub scene, the ballroom scene, and the scene where Jack is locked in the pantry. If you want to know the whole story and not the rehashed elements of the movie, go out and buy The Shining, and I'll guarantee you'll love every minute of it. Of what I've read so far of Mr.King, this is my favorite &quot;horror&quot; story by him, but the top of the list will always remain with The Green Mile. Check them both out!!	2004-02-14

Its that addicting folks, you just cant stop reading this book until you reach the final battle between the Losers and IT, be it may be weird but still making sense with Stephen King's special ability for storytelling. This book revolves around the 7 Losers(They're in the Losers club), and their troubles with the evil on and under Derry. They're all kids who are outcasts at school and have developed a bond because of that. They're constantly haunted by IT, the monster that feeds off the denizens of Derry, Maine, and the murderous Henry Bowers, the local school bully who, by the end of the book, chases the Losers with a switchblade with only one conscious thought: To kill all of them. The Losers eventually gang up on IT and almost destroy IT, but it flees deeper underground, and the Losers vow to return if IT comes back, and IT eventually does, in 1985, and the now grownup Losers fight It to an apocylyptic ending. This story delves into the troubles of adolescence(Bullies, being outcasts)and how to get through their troubles, revenge,evil, friendship, and finally, one of the most recurring elements of IT , Love. Unlike your fellow reviewers, I didn't find this book scary, but I truly loved the story and the way King develops his characters into kids you begin to care for, so its really not necessary to read with other people or whatever, just read with the lights on so you can read a great horror story.	2004-02-11
US	30977056	R32URU6YDKYE1O	0684853515	692650386	Hearts In Atlantis	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Low Men in Yellow Coats	This was a very strange book to read, because of the shifts in the stories, which kept a previous character from one of the previous novellas and further enhanced our understanding of him/her and the troubles that have besaken him/her later on in their lives. The first story in this collection, essentially a novel(it weighs in at 323 pages),Low Men in Yellow Coats, is one of the most touching and brilliant stories ever made. That is why I am giving this book 4 stars, because really only the 1st and the last story you should read,which I think Mr.King should put into an independent book, as I would assuredly give it however many stars are allowed.Low Men revolves around Bobby and his tenant, Ted Brautigan, and weaves a story of coming of age and learning to love even under the harshest of circumstances.This novel also surprised me with a connection to another one of King's writings, but I want say because it was a genuine surprise to me. After this story it goes downhill, and there is really no point to reading the middle stories unless you want to learn what happens to the characters or just have to read the whole thing( like me), but it is imperative that you read the last story, because it is a very good follow up to the first story. Also after finishing this book, see the also very good movie, with one of the most obvious roles for Ted Brautigan, Anthony Hopkins.ENJOY!!!!!!!	2003-12-03
US	30977056	R1QQW6ECE5SOX2	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Stephen King's Best	If a casual reader sees a Stephen King novel, they immedeatly assume that what they're seeing is a horror novel written by an over-imaginative author. While they're definitely scary in many of his books, The Green Mile is essentialy a Drama, and many people began to see this if they have seen the(equally excellent) movie, which was made by the same people as the Shawshank Redemption, so go figure. This book delves into the meaning of faith in the real and the unreal, and the story of convicted John Coffey, one of my favorite King characters of all time. This book is told through the 110 year old Paul Edgecombe, the overseer of the green mile, the path that takes you to death and the heaven or hell that awaits them when they die from Ol' Sparky, the oft spoke of Electric Chair. This is Stephen King's most moving story he has ever written, and 3 times this book made me cry.That never has happened before, and therefore is probably my favorite book of all time.By the way, the Ending is absolutely perfect, and was the third time I cried in this novel.I recommend this book to anyone who's literate, and if you're not get help so you can go out and read this book.5 stars all the way, no questions asked. Mr.King's best character ever also appears in this book and is the enchanting Mr.Jingles. Please take note also of one of Mr. King's vilest enemies he ever put down on paper, The Napoleanic Percy Wetmore.	2003-12-03

After finishing this book, I let out a big breath, probably the first one in over 3 hours, as I could not stop reading this book for its(no pun intended)breathtaking plot and international intrigue. At its heart, this novel is a book about how Japan is taking over America's economy(there are good examples from Crichton, he has done his research, check the rather large bibliography), and the fact that the Japanese will do anything to control it. As Crichton states many times, Japan's motto is &quot;Business is War&quot;, and after finishing this, I cannot help but agree. The story revolves around Lt. Peter Smith and John Connor(haha), who investigate the murder of a beautiful young girl, who was murdered at the Grand Opening of the Nakamoto Building.A great mystery ensues, and even Crichton's lack of detailed descriptions flies by your mind like the pages you are reading. I recommend to read this over the weekend on a soft hammock, just to prove you want fall asleep.Also check out Sphere and Jurassic Park, but do not go anywhere near The Terminal Man.......UGH!	2003-12-02
