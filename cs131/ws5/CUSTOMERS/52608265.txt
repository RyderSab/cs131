As it begins, Abigail Stewart, a book store owner and former librarian from Texas is enjoying a vacation that she won at an island resort off the eastern coast of Mexico. Stumbling upon two big thugs with Russian accents searching her room, she barely escapes with her life. Not knowing where to go for assistance on the tiny island, she returns to the Cantina where she had enjoyed a pleasant lunch with the owners and asks them what to do. Not trusting the local police, they refer her to David Blaine, former FBI Agent, now businessman enjoying a leisurely fishing vacation aboard his beautiful new boat.<br /><br />Terrified and carrying along her Yorkshire Terrier, Chelsea, Abby went to the marina and not seeing anyone called out David's name. Thinking that she was his date for the evening, he told her to come aboard. As it says in the summary on the back of the book, \\"...the supposedly reputable U.S. Agent gave his stowaway a salty reception...between David's volatile masculinity, bookish Abby's daring once-in-a-lifetime jaunt was in tatters.\\"<br /><br />The interplay between these characters was hysterical at times and very entertaining. The romance between two such different people was both believable and touching. The story has many twists and turns which kept me riveted to the end.<br /><br />This is the first of Ms. Gray's books that I've read and it will not be the last. Highly recommended.	2005-09-08

While not as involved or even as compelling as her earlier spectacular time travel novel, Son of the Morning, Killing Time is nonetheless a riveting story with interesting characters and a fascinating hero.<br /><br />Without repeating the plot line related in earlier reviews, the story begins rather slowly and combines the unusual theft of a time capsule and a multiple murder mystery with a bit of science fiction. While these parts of the story were interesting, what fascinated me the most was the heroine, Nikita, and her relationship with detective, Knox Davis. Of all the characters in the book, these two were the most developed and grew more interesting as the story went forward. I enjoyed the bantering humor between them and the way that they progressed from mistrust and disbelief to attraction, hurt, caring and love. It seemed that I was just beginning to know them well when the book ended leaving me wishing for more.<br /><br />There were some aspects of the plot that were not fully fleshed out such as why a key character had committed suicide earlier in the story and what was meant by the cryptic message left in a time capsule. Other items that I wished had been explained further were sort of left up in the air. I won't go into these because to do so would spoil the story. The romantic scenes, however, are classic Linda Howard.<br /><br />The book as a whole was very enjoyable and I highly recommended it.	2005-06-29
US	52608265	R1WLNGF9CCLV7A	0505524929	743196609	Virtual Warrior	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Great Story ~ Totally Absorbing	Let me start by saying I have NEVER read any of the Fantasy books that seem to be so popular today. I bought this book based on the excellent reviews that it received and because the story intrigued me. How would a person transport him/herself into cyberspace? What would happen to him and could he ever get back? Wondering if I could deal with lavender skies and strange sounding names, after reading the first chapter I was hooked!<br /><br />Ms. Lawrence is a spellbinding story teller. Rather than repeat the story line, I will say that the pages are filled with action, adventure, fascinating characters, and a compelling, believable attraction between the two main characters, Ardra and Lien, that blooms into a romance. As the story progresses, Lien grows from a dissatisfied person escaping into the virtual world of Tolemac to a brave and competent warrior capable of protecting and standing by the equally brave and competent Ardra.<br /><br />As a side note, I was intrigued by the way that the author reversed the spelling of names to create new places and characters (e.g., Tolemac = Camelot; Nilrem = Merlin; Neil = Lien; Einalem = Melanie; and the wicked Samoht = Thomas whose name made more sense after I read \\"Virtual Heaven\\") and loved the fact that Ardra's name was a palindrome (spelled the same backwards or forwards). For some reason, I enjoyed the device and it made me comfortable with the odd sounding names.<br /><br />The world of Tolemac is beautiful and intriguing as well with its medieval surroundings and lifestyle, lavender skies, four \\"orbs\\" (moons), and exotic creatures. There was just enough difference in the landscape of this new \\"cyber-world\\" to make it believable and there were enough common features to make it comfortable.<br /><br />After reading \\"Virtual Warrior\\", I sought out and bought the rest of the author's books. I've read \\"Virtual Heaven\\" and enjoyed it thoroughly, and am looking forward to reading \\"Virtual Desire\\" as soon as it arrives. While linked as a series, the stories in each of the books can stand alone. I hope that Ms. Lawrence writes more books for this series and continues the adventures in \\"Tolemac\\" for a long time to come!<br /><br />Highly recommended.in each of the books can stand alone.

Why? Because in this year's campaign for the Presidency, Senator Kerry has made his service in Vietnam the critical focal point of his resume.<br /><br />As one who lived through that time, I remember well Kerry's testimony before the Senate and how it affected our thinking about the war. I didn't recall his name, but I did recall being appalled by the vivid statements he made. The fact that those statements came from a \\"decorated naval officer\\" gave the testimony weight it would not otherwise have had. Similarly, his membership in a group called \\"Vietnam Veterans Against the War\\" also caught the attention of the American public. What we did not know at the time was the abbreviated nature of Kerry's service in Vietnam. We also did not know that the so-called Vietnam Veterans Against the War were, for the most part, neither veterans nor individuals who actually saw service in Vietnam.<br /><br />All of these issues are addressed with factual documentation and testimony in this book, \\"Unfit For Command.\\" To learn many years later that we, the American public, were being lied to by both the media and these sometime \\"patriots\\" while our friends and family members were still on the field of battle angers and sickens me. We didn't do enough then to know what was going on. Today, we have no excuse not to learn all we can about those years. We have this obligation not only to correct the record but to prevent the ultimate insult to those who served their country so nobly all those years ago - the election of a man who stabbed them and us in the back with lies, distortions and slander.<br /><br />I have read \\"Unfit For Command\\" and found it factual and compelling. I urge everyone to read the book and form their own opinion. Regardless of how one comes out on the political side of this year's presidential race, as Americans we cannot bury our heads in the sand simply because the facts are difficult to face.	2004-09-03

That's about as much as there is in the story about the series. The rest of the plot actually centers on Harrison's difficulties in raising his three small children - David, Chelsey and Benny - since their mother died in an auto accident the previous year.<br />Harrison is filled with guilt because the children miss their mother and also because prior to her death, their marriage seemed to be almost nonexistent. To escape what was an increasingly unhappy home, he spent long hours at his work leaving the children with the impression - reinforced by their mother - that he didn't care about them.<br />Trying to find some way of connecting with his children, Harrison takes them to story day at the library. The children come alive and respond very positively to the librarian, Maggie Conrad, who is reading the story. She has such a good effect on them that the children ask her to come home with them. Later, Harrison asks Maggie if she would become the children's nanny after work to help them become more adjusted. She agrees and over time becomes an indespensable part of the family - another &quot;Parker&quot; as the kids call her. So many issues have to be worked out between Harrison and the children many of which were not of his making. Maggie's loving and optimistic nature help them sort things through and as they do, she and Harrison fall in love.<br />This is a very sweet story, and the personalities of the children  are endearing. What is also touching is Harrison's love for his children. He is  determined to understand whatever mistakes he may have been made in the past (real or created by his late wife) and to overcome them.<br />The one figure in the book that remained somewhat unfinished was Lisa, Harrison's late wife. She seemed to be the cause of so many of the children's insecurities and problems with their father. We know she was unhappy; we just never really found out why. I also wish that the book could have had an epilogue or perhaps another chapter just to give us a peak at the happy future of Harrison, Maggie and the children. Perhaps future books in the series will let us know more about them. All in all, a good read.many of the children's insecurities and problems with their father.

US	52608265	R2GKZODGSZN47I	0060560789	244897573	Your Wicked Ways (Duchess in Love)	Books	5	13	15	N	N	A Darling Book: Unique Hero and Heroine Fall in Love...Again	I started this book not expecting much based upon other reviews. But having read Eloisa James' books before and thoroughly enjoyed them, I thought I'd take a chance.<br />Once of the special things about Ms. James books is that her characters and plot lines are a little off the beaten path so to speak. That is to say, she just doesn't churn out the typical Regency Romance with the dashing hero, brave to a fault, devilshly handsome, sometime cad, master of the bedroom, need I go on.....? No, her characters have some flaws - not a lot of them thank God or they might be totally irredeemable, but enough to see them through the growth process in the story line.<br />In this story, we have two very young people, Rees the Earl Godwin and Helene, who were initially drawn to each other for a variety of reasons, and run away to Gretna Green to get married. They both share a passion for music and believe this mutual interest plus their love will be all they need to make a good marriage. However, they soon discover that marriage takes more than a few songs and stolen kisses to make it work.<br />For one thing, the wedding night left a good deal to be desired. Shy and uncertain about what to expect, Helene felt inadequate. Her husband, also leery of the night before him, stayed down in the tavern a little too long and arrived at their bedroom completely foxed. [The reader will not discover what caused this disasterous first night until later in the book when Helene and Rees finally confess their fears and disappointments about that night and learn that both of them had been virgins.] The marriage starts off badly, and leaves both mentally scarred about their respective inadequacies. Finally, in a fit of temper, Helene throws the chamber pot at her husband; and Rees, who has had enough of this unsatisfactory marriage, throws Helene out of his house. She then goes home to live with her mother, and for nine long years is virtuous and miserable. Though they stay married, Rees goes on to live the life of a supposed &quot;Rakehell&quot; breaking every taboo mostly to irritate his demanding father and miserable becasue he misses Helene.<br />As the years pass Helene realizes that she would like to have a child. She asks Rees for a divorce and he refuses because of the damage that it could do to their reputations. After Helene receives a &quot;make over&quot; in her wardrobe to more sensually show off her lovely figure, and a completely new hairstyle that enhances her lovely face, Rees sees her in a whole new light. He decides that if she must have a child, it should be his; and after some length of discussion finally persuades her that she should move back into his home for a month until she conceives.<br />From there the real romance begins, but not in your typical way.  For one thing, Rees insists that Lina, his opera singer and former lover remain in his house so that she can practice his songs for the opera he is writing. This brings about some amusing and awkward moments between Helene and Lina.<br />As Rees and Helene mature, each learn the pleasure of discovering who their lover really is. It is delightful to watch them grow together to finally understand that what brought them to each other initially could be built upon and transformed into a truly beautiful marriage of mind, body and spirit. (I don't mean to be cliche here, but that's how I saw the book. In one sense it sort of reminded me of &quot;Enchanted April&quot; as the characters who thought they knew all about each other found entirely new and attractive aspects to their loved ones - facets that they had never appreciated or understood fully before.)<br />There is a secondary plot concerning Rees' brother Tom, the Vicar, who oddly enough falls deeply in love with Rees' former lover, Lina. It seems Lina has outgrown her relationship with Rees and hasn't been intimate with him for over a year. She and Tom, however, set the sparks flying whenever they're in the same room.<br />I found this book to be delightful and a real change of pace from the usual Regency Romance. Although none of the characters has the sort of perfection that I also love in Regency heros - you know tall, dark, handsome men, too charming for their own good to hide their tortured souls because of some life altering event in their past..... Rees is nothing like this. Oh, he's a rebel alright, kind of a  Regency &quot;Bad Boy.&quot; But it's fun to watch him grow in character, and of course, Helene is right there with him learning about herself and gaining self-confidence along the way.<br />A great book with a lovely ending, and one I recommend to all.und this book to be delightful and a real change of pace from the usual Regency Romance.

From the very first page, however, I was drawn into this lovely story.<br /><br />Although this book is the last chapter in Sharon De Vita's saga about the Blackwell family, the story is strong enough to stand on its own. In the prologue to the book, 8 year old Colt, who was adopted by Justin and Emma Blackwell, has run away from home at Christmas time because the holiday is too hard for him to bear. Justin knows just where to look and finds Colt at the grave of his 3-year old brother, Cade, who died in a fire the previous Christmas. Because Colt was unable to save his baby brother, he holds himself responsible for his death. Christmas only serves to remind him of this terrible heartache, and in the years to come he refuses to celebrate the holiday.<br /><br />Twenty-five years later we find Colt is the sheriff of Blackwell. He is approached on the telephone by the new director of the Home for Children who at his mother's behest asks him to play Santa Claus at their Christmas celebration. Colt adamantly refuses, but later feels guilty for letting his mother down and offers to pay for a \\"hired\\" Santa. He visits the Home and meets the director, Dr. Brenna Baxter, a lovely young woman with a PhD. in Social Services and a precocious 5 year old daughter named Charlie. She refuses to accept his money, and storms off thinking that Colt is a rude and cold person who doesn't like Christmas or children.<br /><br />Dr. Baxter soon finds out how wrong she is about Colt when he and his brothers save her, Charlie and five other children in the Home from a devastating fire. With nowhere to go, Colt and his family take her and the children into their home. As Brenna and Colt learn more about each other, they find healing through trust and the power of love.<br /><br />The best part of the story are the delightful children each of whom has a disability of some sort. As with all of the characters in this book, they are well drawn and tug at your heart. They each have the strength, wonder and optimism that is so amazing in children, and their personalities are endearing. The story also shows that with a little attention and love, children can heal a person's heart and bring him redemption.<br /><br />This was a most enjoyable read. I highly recommend this little jewel of a book to everyone.cters in this book, they are well drawn and tug at your heart.

After 9/11, I find it extremely offensive.<br />The book begins rather well with a riveting description of the bombing mission over Lybia in 1986 and proceeds downward from there. Asad Khalil, the terrorist du jour, lost his family in that bombing raid while concurrently deflowering his reluctant girlfriend in defiance of the law, religion, etc. He also murders said girlfriend at the same time to stop her from screaming in fright as the bombs drop near their rooftop love nest. This, in his twisted way of thinking, gives him one more reason to hate the vile Americans.<br />Swearing vengeance - and possibly to escape his own death sentence based on his tryst on the roof - Khalil vows to make the Americans pay. He receives training in the necessary skills to murder and maim from a dubious character named \\"Boris\\" and presto-chango turns from a bungling juvenile rapist into a brilliant terrorist operative who can thwart the powers that be at every turn.<br />From that point on there are so many twists and turns in the story it makes one sea sick. No matter how absurd the circumstances, Khalil manages to be three or four steps ahead of everybody while killing infidels left and right.<br />Enter John Corey complete with a new girlfriend, Kate, (what ever happened to the \\"love of his life\\" from Plum Island?) to somewhat save the day. Never mind that just about everybody is dead by the time Corey and Kate manage to figure things out.<br />DeMille's books up to now have been quite good. I especially liked Plum Island. Corey's quick witted character fed up with administrative overkill and bungling in that book made sense. The John Corey in \\"The Lion's Game\\" has the same \\"I-don't-give-a-rip\\" attitude, only this time his witticisms come off as juvenile and very annoying. To sum up my feelings at the end of the book - the weak come off as strong and the strong end up dead. If you like that kind of plot, you will love this one.u like that kind of plot, you will love this one.	2004-01-19

Leticia is a 23 year old southern belle widow who is living in Kentucky and taking care of her aging, bitter grandmother, Honoria Sinclair. On her death bed, her grandmother spitefully tells her only grandchild that she is not a true Sinclair because she is illegitimate. The name Sinclair seems to be the only thing that matters to Honoria, and she is so filled with hate that she pushes Leticia away and bequeaths her home, Bellewood plantation, to the church with the provision that her granddaughter no longer be allowed to live there.<br />Homeless after the death of Honoria, Leticia decides to travel to San Diego, California to live with her stepfather, Hunt Ramsey, who was so kind to her as a child. During her journey west, her stagecoach is robbed by a rag tag group of bandits who kill the drivers and take her captive with the plan to sell her into prostitution in Mexico. Leticia is rescued by Adam McCormick, a mysterious man who buys her from her captors and promises to take her to her \\"papa\\" - Hunt Ramsey - in California. Unknown to Leticia, Adam has his own reasons to find Hunt Ramsey and has plans to \\"bring him to justice\\" in order to avenge his mother and fulfill her dying wish.<br />Leticia is the perfect compliment for Adam - a mixture of innocence, determination and kindness that he finds irresistible. Adam is the perfect \\"hero\\" - a handsome, intelligent adventurer who is not only secure in himself but has a strong sense of honor. He cannot believe his good fortune in finding Ramsey's daughter and decides to use Leticia as a hostage in order to lure her father into a scheme to bring him down. What Adam never planned or expected, however, was to fall in love with her, and he is torn between his commitment to avenge his mother and his desire to care for and protect Leticia.<br />The journey that both of them take to settle Adam's conflict is filled with adventure and is both touching and at times humorous. After all she had to tolerate with her grandmother, Leticia has determined that no one will ever use her again. Her vitality and spunk not only win Adam over but actually save his life and help him find a resolution to his desire to punish Hunt Ramsey.<br />At the end of the book, the author gives a hint that a follow up book may be written to tell the story of Adam's brother, Swen.

I have learned since I wrote this review that the author (Jean Stribling) primarily writes under the name of Ruth Jean Dale. Happily, many of her books are available!	2003-10-23

The main character, Chase Malone, is described as an ex-Marine helicopter pilot turned successful artist living in his own personal paradise in Cozumel. Like many of the author's heros, Malone is a complex combination of seemingly contradictory qualities: a trained killer with artistic ability; gentle yet lethal; tender but prone to intense anger. His perfect life is ruined when he turns down a  commission to paint the portrait of Sienna, the beautiful wife of international arms dealer, Derek Bellasar. Suddenly, his home is destroyed - literally; the businesses in the surrounding town close; and his agent's gallery in New York is bought out. In short, his perfect life is quickly and efficiently brought to an end by his newly acquired enemy, Mr. Bellasar, who doesn't like to take \\"no\\" for an answer. Naturally, Chase vows revenge, and I was looking forward to read how he would deal with this villain and get his life back. Toward the end of the book, after twists and turns and interesting new characters that arrive only to never be seen again, a sort of \\"pay back\\" is finally achieved, but it is somewhat bittersweet and hence disappointing.<br />While deciding how to carry out his revenge, Chase is persuaded to help an old friend, Jeb, whose life he saved in Panama years before. Jeb now works for the CIA and wants to get an \\"agent\\" in close to Bellasar to learn more about his nefarious activities. He explains that the way to do this is for Chase to accept the commission and rescue Sienna, who Jeb explains Bellasar is about to murder. It seems Bellasar has a number of odd habits one of which is to kill his wives (3 to date) once they turn 30 and begin to show signs of aging. The magic age of 30 is explained later in the book, but by that time the reader will have figured out the reason so it's not much of a revelation. Besides, I couldn't help wonder - with all of his wealth and power, and a good pre-nup, did Bellasar really have to resort to such extreme measures? Anyway...Chase takes the job, finds the beautiful Sienna captivating, falls in love with her and after much shooting and blowing up of things rescues her from her vile husband. Then the pursuit begins.<br />The book kept me interested, but like many of the other reviewers I just couldn't see the attraction that Chase had to Sienna or for that matter her response to him. Morrell depicts her as so incredibly beautiful that people are somewhat awed in her presence, and he does a very good job of describing Sienna's extreme discomfort at being regarded only for her beauty as well as being treated like a \\"thing\\". Her personality, however, doesn't grow beyond this aspect in the book, so much so that it made Chase's sudden intense love for her difficult to understand. At times she seems naive; at other times she displays a surprising intelligence only to lapse back into a sort of blandness. The interaction between Sienna and Chase that must have led to their developing affection and ultimate devotion is only implied or hinted at. I think that if the author had explored this aspect of the story a little more and minimized the shoot-em up scenes (so extreme at times that they were almost comical), the unusual ending of the book might have been more acceptable.<br />Without giving away the conclusion, after reading the Epilogue, I had the feeling that Morrell wrote this part of the story first and then developed the rest of the book to go around it. Either way, it just didn't make sense. At the end, the main focus of the story still seemed to be Sienna's external beauty and not much more.

She loves her new job as a linguist and representative for the Las Vegas Visitors and Convention Bureau, her new home (though somewhat bare of furniture), and her new life. The only thing to upset this happy picture is Molly's new neighbor, Major Sam Henderson, USAF.  He drives her to pin scolding notes on his door about trash cans left in the middle of her driveway, to make angry phone calls to complain about the loud country western music blaring from his house, and to threaten legal action if he uproots the hot pink oleander bushes that she lovingly planted along their disputed property line, just so that he can install a swimming pool in his backyard.<br /><br />One night following a particularly long and loud bout of ear splitting music, Molly called her neighbor to complain - yet again. However, Molly mistakenly dialed the wrong number and instead of talking to her neighbor, she listened in horror while the man who answered the phone was interrupted by a \\"visitor\\" who then shot him to death. Still not realizing that she had reached the wrong number, Molly called 911 to report that her neighbor, Sam Henderson, had  been shot. The police arrive, wake up her perfectly fine (though royally miffed) neighbor, and the story takes off from there.<br /><br />Unknown to Molly, Sam is recovering from an accident that occurred when he ejected from an F15 and his head hit the faulty canopy. As a result of his injury, Sam experiences severe headaches that prevent him from flying and threaten to end his career. Refusing to take any of the variety of pain medications that he has been given, Sam deals with the pain by working out until he is exhausted while listening to his favorite country western music. Following Molly's ill-fated wrong number telephone call, she and Sam seem to be thrown together, literally, and their attraction to each other and growing admiration for each other overcome their previous, instantaneous dislike. They seem ill suited to one another, but as you read through the story it's really difficult to imagine them apart or with anyone else. Other characters in the book like Molly's boss, Davinia, and Antonio, her boyfriend and husband in training number 4, provide the perfect contrast to the two main characters as they attempt to solve a murder and prevent Molly from becoming the next victim.<br /><br />The book was a great, entertaining read, and I highly recommend it.er and growing admiration for each other overcome their previous, instantaneous dislike.

I only want to voice my concern about the nature of the gratuitous horror described in the book, and the lack of any persons of character in the story. Rather, the plot seems to be made up of a bunch of well educated, seemingly attractive, accomplished \\"urban cannibals\\" who by chance live and work in and around the same environment. The so-called heroine in the story (who comes by that title because she is one of the few characters left standing at the end of the book) is a weak, foolish, insipid \\"Daddy's little girl\\" whose only real concern in the face of all the horror she observes is to prove to Daddy that she is a \\"real-life, tough attorney\\" after all - a conclusion that is questionable at best.<br />The ending of this book is so abominably grotesque that it could only have been written by the author to escape the rather tame endings of his previous books. Perhaps he was aiming for something unique or something to set his book apart from all the other suspense novels on the shelf. If shock and disgust were what he was trying to achieve, he was successful; however, the novelty was so obviously contrived (along with the rest of the plot), that one could see it coming several chapters in advance.<br />Why did I read it? Well, I have been a fan of this author for some time, and was hoping that somewhere along the line the book would redeem itself and turn into a real mystery with at least one likeable character rather that the sick journey of misfits and victims that it became. When finished, I didn't even give this one to the Goodwill; I threw it in the trash - where it belonged in the first place.	2003-02-27

In trying to find out just how she was involved so that he can find the killer, he makes her life miserable by following her every move and reminding her of how guilty he believes she is. Though Evie tries to explain her innocence, Jack will have none of it.<br /><br />The story takes place the French Quarter in New Orleans during July. It is this kind of setting that Marilyn Pappano best brings to life (read her SOUTHERN KNIGHTS Series) with vivid sights, sounds, fragrances, and ancient mystery. As Jack and Evie work through their intense relationship and try to find a vicious killer, they encounter exotic concepts such as mind reading, fortune telling, foreseeing the future and even a little Vodoo employed by the villain. It is a complex, touching, loving book with vivid images and passion. Do not miss this one.	2003-02-19

But for Tanya, his deep brown eyes spoke of passion, not just security...life, not just existence. Only he could give her back her son, but could she find the courage to accept everything else he offered?\\"<br />The story begins with a tragedy: Tanya Bishop shot and killed her drunken, abusive husband and was sent to prison for murder. Eleven years later, she returned to claim the baby son, Antonio, that she'd left behind. In the intervening years, Antonio has been raised by his father's cousin, Ramon Quezada. Now, Tanya faces the concern of how her son will accept her as well as her growing awareness and attraction to Ramon.<br />Letters that Tanya wrote to her son during her imprisonment are interspersed throughout the story, and provide a loving insight into Tanya, her life and the pain of not being with her son. This is a touching story that tugs on the heart strings as we watch Tanya become reacquainted with her son - first as a stranger (the new cook) and then her acceptance by Antonio as he realizes that she is his mother.

As she and her coachman are trying to make their way in a thick, blinding fog, they come upon a man and request his help. Unknown to Camilla, the man, Benedict Wincross (aka Lord Rawdon), is hiding from some men who are pursuing him. By asking for his help, Camilla has given away his hiding place and gunfire ensues. Benedict manages to get them both out of that predicament, but the basis for a hostile relationship between the two has been established. She sees him as a probable low-life theif; he sees her as a pain in the neck \\"bluestocking.\\" Of course, each blames the other for the mess in which they find themselves.<br /><br />They finally manage to arrive at the local inn muddy and disheveled, and find that despite their mutual dislike they can help each other. Camilla has given her Grandfather the impression that she is about to be married in order to calm his concerns about her future. In truth, there is no fiance in sight as Camilla has no intention of ever getting married. Mr. Benedict, as she has come to know him, needs to investigate the area in and around her Grandfather's estate in order to discover who has infiltrated a network of British spies that travel between England and France under the ruse of being smugglers. As a solution to both of their problems, Camilla and Benedict form a pact of sorts and agree to travel together to her Grandfather's estate under the pretense that they are engaged to be married. Camilla will arrive with her supposed fiance in tow, and Benedict will have the necessary cover and a base from which to carry out his investigation.<br /><br />The fun begins when they arrive at the estate and fall into one absurd situation after another as they try to convince Camilla's relatives that they are engaged. The plot becomes even more complicated when Camilla finds that her dear hair-brained Aunt has told her relatives that Camilla and Benedict are already married. One hilarious thing leads to another and the two former antagonists find themselves gradually falling in love.

Although the plot is clever and lively at the start, &quot;Wolfgang's&quot; constant !!! use of bizarre oaths (e.g.,  &quot;Satan's small clothes,&quot; &quot;By Satan's Pointed Tail,&quot;  &quot;Lucifer's Cloven Hoof&quot; - to name but a few) really became  annoying after a while and got in the way of the story.  Also, Lord  Melboure's dialog written to demonstrate his exagerated lisp (which at  times was difficult to decipher) also interrupted the flow of the story.  Last but not least, the silly bedroom scene on the inevitable wedding night  (I skipped ahead), complete with a jealous cat and Irish Wolfhound, was a  bit much to believe.<br />I notice that other readers really liked this  book, so perhaps I was looking for something different.

After having read and thoroughly enjoyed The Black Lyon, I just could not believe that the same author had written this book!  The notion that a young woman in the early 1900's who acts like an automaton with apparent  willingness would simply toss away all of her mental and physical  restrictions and be instantaneously transformed through some bizarre  &quot;awakening&quot; that includes passionless sex and social dancing  lessons followed by a lame attempt at social protest is just not believable  - let alone entertaining.  In contrast, The Black Lyon (the only other book  I have read by Jude Deveraux) proves that this author is capable of  creating characters and story lines with greater depth and interest.	1999-07-26
