The author plays with the usual ingredients of her books, and reverses them (the man who appears to be the hero is actually the villian.)  Everybody is slightly absurd, including the heroine.  In books by numberless imitators of Ms. Heyer, the heroine is always perfect.  Not here.  Kitty Charing is bright and good-natured.  She is also very innocent, very impulsive, a crusader, a match-maker, and the despair of her putative fiancee, Freddy Standen.  Freddy himself is one of Ms. Heyer's happiest creations.  The plot is tightly wound, and fits together with satisfying clicks.  Great scenes:  Dophinton's proposal to Kitty; Freddy's ditto; Kitty meets Freddy's family; Freddy and Kitty go sight-seeing in London; Freddy discusses the Elgin Marbles with his father;  Freddy discovers why Kitty is seeing Dolphinton; Kitty and Olivia encounter Olivia elderly admirer; the masquerade; the elopement; and Jack's comeuppance at the hands of Freddy.<br />If you have never read this book, prepare for a treat.	2003-11-03

The first book is good, the second is brilliant (yes, it's contrived.  It's also a superb comic novel), the next two published: &quot;Flash for Freedom&quot; and &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; are both first-rate.  The next one published, &quot;Flashman's Lady&quot; wasn't particularly good, and it's downhill from there, with signs of life in &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; but not much else. <br />I tried to read this book some years ago, and gave it up.  I only made it through this time because I was determined, and determination is what you need.  There are no less than three plots to get Flashman to help John Brown, by three different groups, and explained, ad nauseum, in three different patois.  Characters from previous Flashman books show up:  a good thing in the case of John Charity Spring, but fairly pointless in the case of Annette Mandeville and Crixtus.  The book has a truncated feel, as if it has been either heavily edited or padded.  Or both.  <br />It's still fun to spend time with ye olde Flash, shameless as he is.  His lack of political correctness (this was one of things that rescued &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot;) is still a joy.  But Fraser appears a bit tired.  The deadpan footnotes that made &quot;Royal Flash&quot; such a knee-slapper are long gone.  Too bad.	2003-10-18

Fraser takes the pieties of &quot;Tom Brown Schooldays&quot; and the romantic farrago of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and makes of them something altogether hilarious.  <br />There is a movie adaptation, directed by Richard Lester.

That's just a warning:  this book is basically fanfiction masquerading as a novel.  I doubt she had much, if any, imput into this novel; it uses her characters, and not much else.  She certainly didn't write it.<br />Norton used to write excellent juvenile fiction, generally (though not always) with male protagonists.  From about 1954 to 1969, the books are generally worth reading.  After that, folks, you're on your own.  Norton started heavily into fantansy, generally with female protagonists.  The books became very formulaic, and I found the &quot;Witch World&quot; books a serious yawn, except for &quot;Year of the Unicorn.&quot;<br />Two books from the classic era were &quot;The Beast Master&quot; and &quot;Lord of Thunder.&quot;  This is not the lousy movie of the same title, featuring Marc Singer in a bad dye job, I might note.  Both books are interesting reading.<br />This book purports to be a sequel to &quot;Lord of Thunder&quot;.  To be fair, the plot isn't at all bad, though it features irritating Mary-Suism via Tani (no last name), our heroine.  Hosteen Storm thus becomes a bystander in his own series.  Tani might have been an engaging character if Lyn McConchie had any discernable talent.  Alas, she doesn't, not on the evidence here.<br />The writing style is poor, often rushed.  I agree with the other person who said it seemed like a first draft.  And I've rarely seen a book with so many punctuation mistakes:  missing question marks and possessives abound.  Could I do a better job than this? Yeah.  And so could your Aunt Sally.  If Andre Norton is going to prostitute her own creations like this, I wish she'd choose a better collaborator.  That's always supposing she even knows what's going on.	2003-04-02

I read somewhere that Bujold had been accused of leaving religion out of Barrayar; well, she makes up for it here.  <br />This is a fantasy novel, but the realistic underpinings are not hard to spot:  Isabella of Castile, Ferdinard of Aragon, and the reunification of Spain.  The Moors, here called the Roknari, are given Viking characteristics.  <br />If we were in fanboy-land, which fortunately, we're not, the hero would be a cynical mercenary.  But Bujold's in charge, so we get an awkward man who without being unworldly, is helplessly virtuous.  A not very popular notion these days, virture being thoroughly out of style, but at least Bujold does not give us ye olde 'virtuous characters are so difficult to make interesting' rationale.  She has no difficulty at all in making Cazaril interesting, mainly because she actually has imagination.<br />The humour is more oblique than in many of the Vorkosigan books, but then it's also more subtle (I particularly liked Cazaril's assurance to Betriz that the villain is making up to her for political reasons.)<br />I've seen plenty of faked-up religions in fantasy novels; but this is one of the few I found convincing, even fascinating.  The scene where Cazaril meets his goddess is particularly good.  Since I didn't much like \\"The Spirit Ring\\" I didn't expect to like this novel as much as I did.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-20

I enjoyed it a lot more than Episode Iuntil I read this book. Stripped of Lucass striking visuals, the story seems much worse than I remember.<br />This novelization reminds me a lot of an extremely bad prequel book called Rogue Planet (by Greg Bear) in which Anakin is twelve years old.  Both books start off with an long, endless action scene, which are supposed to be thrilling, but because the authors lack the skills to animate them, just lay there in the books, like unpoached eggs.<br />There is additional material in the book, but its so bland, its painful to read.  Padme and her family are just stick-figures; ditto Shmi and her step-family.  The author doesnt bring any of these people to life.  In fact, he tries only with Anakin, and even there, hes unsuccessful.  <br />Then theres the style.  For those reviewers who said this was the best book they ever read; I can only assume it was also the only one.  (Cereal boxes dont count)   The prose is extremely  peculiar, as if something who only spoke Hungarian was translating it into English from the Japanese.  It has no flow at all, and its full of strange illiteracies.   I dont know the author at all, does he write comic books?  It seemed like a kids book to me.   Lucasfilm seems to have given up on the mainstream audience completely.  The question is: why?  Compare this to the ESB novelization, and youll see the difference.  This book would be a big hit in a creative writing course; they could use it as a Dont Let This Happen to You example, its that bad.<br />And no, I will not cut the author some slack because it was a rush job.  I dont notice theyre reducing the price because this book is a piece of garbage, are they?  Um, no.<br />Another problem: without the visuals the borrowings become much more obvious.  For the Austin Powers fans theres Jango and his Mini-Me, Boba (these scenes in the book are hilariously dumb,  unintentionally, I think); for the Titanic fans, theres oceans of lame romantic plot and dialogue; and for you Gladiator fans, well, theres a crib of the famous Forum scene.<br />Theres no originality, fire, interest.  Just a tired milking of the genre to make money.  It made me very relieved that I borrowed the book from the library and didnt spend money on it.<br />The bad thing is, this travesty made me reluctant to see the movie again, and the movie, as I said, was enjoyable.	2002-08-04

A previous reviewer notes that we also don't get an idea of Caroline's character.  That's accurate, unfortunately.  <br />This book has a huge range of eccentric characters---George III (the Mad Business), his huge family (including George IV, Caroline's dissolute husband), his bitchy mistresses, scheming politicians, and so forth.  What a cast for an opera bouffe!  But Ms. Fraser does nothing with it.  She describes these looney people with a deadening objectiveness.  She casually dismisses the possibility that Caroline may have suffered from poriphyria.  She explores nothing.<br />She has done her research, which she displays with a lady-like pleasure.  The bones of the book are there;  the heart and brains are missing.  I get the impression that the very aristocratic Ms. Fraser feels being interesting is vul-gar.  If so, she's in the wrong profession.	2002-06-23

The set-up, with the soccer bit, lacks Aiken's usual wit, and the mind-speech and other stuff seems forced.  But Is's relationship with her grandfather and aunt is good.

After four increasingly generic paperback (all with basically the same plot), the NJO returns to the plummy awfulness of \\"Vector Prime\\" with its second hardback, \\"Balance Point.\\" Like \\"Vector Prime\\" and the paperbacks, it has the same damn plot, and like them it's not very good judged by ordinary standards.  Which are the only ones I know.<br />The NJO books appear to be more like a television series than a book sequence.  Interest has been waning, so they did what they do with fading sitcoms--suddenly there's a pregnancy.  Big surprise!  The prospective mother is over forty and esperately ill, no naturally the parents seek no medical assistance whatsoever.  <br />And the powers that be appear to be setting up the princess and the pirate for a spin-off.  I can see the advertising now:  \\"Dysfunction Junction!  Real Drama!  Watch \\"The Solos\\" Tuesdays at nine! Here's the set-up:  Dad is pouting because Mom is canoodling with her former beau, Mr. Perfect (or in this case, Prince Perfect).  Mom, whose talents could be better used in a thouand different places, somehow conveniently winds up within a stone's throw of all the other characters, doing something or other.  Sis whines because Mom is uninterested in motherhood (duh, like saving the galaxy should come second).  Younger son, being set up as the hearttrob of the TV (oops, I mean book) series, poses a lot and blows kisses at the swooning masses.  Elder son provides Christlike symbolism, including the crucifixion posture on the cover, plus arguments about pacificism (yes, it's the old 'my-son-is-a-conscientious-objector-in-the-middle-of-WWIII-oh-woe-is-me' plot).  Don't miss the next episode, a soapy resolution is guaranteed!  Watch Dad and Mom kiss and make up!  Watch Sis regain her eyesight!  Watch elder son bore himself (and us) to death!  Watch younger son fall in love with his own chin dimple!<br />Then we have the villainous Vong, who are as hilariously campy as ever.  They talk like Bela Lugosi, and I kept waiting for them to say, \\"Zhey mak buttifal muzik, ze children of ze night.\\"  the torture scene had me rolling on the floor laughing (I half expected Mom to say to the head Vong in her mid-Atlantic accent, \\"I thought I recognized your stench when I came aboard,\\" but no such luck.)	2002-02-05

Your tolerance for this book will be determined by whether or not you find it entirely retrograde, as I did.  Slim Keith was a society woman who never had a job, never did a stroke of work, and specialized in famous and/or rich husbands.  <br />The first was Howard Hawks.  He had a wife in the madhouse, three children, and was much older than her.  But he was rich, famous, and had an interesting life, so Slim moved in with him.  Keith has little good to say about him, but one guesses that the people that she slags may also have some negative things to say about her.  She states that she cut their daughter off from him deliberately, after their marriage ended, and doesn't appear ashamed of it.<br />Husband #2 was Leland Hayward, agent extraordinaire.  He had a wife who was periodically crazy (Margaret Sullavan), three children (also periodically crazy) and was considerably older. He was also a producer, and was wealthy with an interesting life.  Slim turns into a predator again, big surprise.<br />At this point, a very interesting thing happens:  Slim's second husband encounters another predator, one much tougher and ruthless than she:  Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman.  And he leaves Slim for Pamela, to Slim's (in the past, she'd done the husband-poaching) pained surprise.  Slim's shock is profound.  If you believe her, she didn't deserve this treatment.  However, if you consult Sally Bedell Smith's bio of Pamela Harriman, you discover that Slim had an affair during her marriage to Hayward and told him about it.  She was also bored with him and had taken to insulting him in public.  <br />Husband #3 is Lord Keith.  All he has to offer is money (no fame, and no interesting life) but then the bereft Slim is getting older.<br />In between, we get accounts of Capote and Hemingway (signifigantly, though they are washed up by the time they start consorting with the likes of Slim).<br />When Slim's marriage to #3 ends, so does her book.  She appears to feel we are only interested in her famous or rich husbands.  The last 20 years of her life aren't covered at all.  How did she manage alone?  Did she ever conclude that she'd wasted her life?  We don't know, and she won't tell us.  She is almost pathetically anxious to prove that she is intelligent, and if she were born today she would have done something herself instead of leaching on the fame of others.	2002-01-07

The problem with the first is that the writer becomes eager to show off that she has done her homework.  So she repeats information--the same information--that she has obtained from numerous sources, over and over. You can almost reconstruct the questionaire she used for her interviews from the information disclosed.  Did Natalie mention her fear of dark water to you?  Or the gypsy curse?  It's a wonder Wood had any time to have a career at all, she appeared to be so busy going about expressing her fear of H20 to all and sundry.  It never seems to occur to Finstad that Wood might have colored or exaggerated her stories of her childhood and youth in Hollywood to garner sympathy, a ploy not unknown to actresses.  (Monroe and Garland were both experts at this.)  More skepticism and less gullibility would be welcome.  And instead of regurgitating the same material endlessly, she would have been better to analyze it.<br />Wood was a very pretty child with a very ambitious mother.  Not an unfamiliar story.  The difficulty is that once her mom fades out of the story, our interest flags.  She is appalling, but her vitality far outstrips that of her daughter.  Wood undoubtedly had a painful problem;  she needed to ditch her mother to survive, but upon ditching her, she seems utterly panicked and bereft.  Natalie herself appears to be a rather nice, rather unexceptional, rather neurotic woman way out of her depth in Hollywood.  As an actress, she had a somnambulistic quality, and after sampling her mother, you'll know why. The pity of it was that Wood was quite ambitious, but utterly conventional, so that she missed opportunities that she might have profited by.<br />The material on Wood's death, which seems to be have been a grotesque accident, is just speculation.  Finstad loves conspiracies, but frankly, who cares?  It's pretty obvious Wood wasn't murdered.  I seem to recall a quote from Finstad saying she was moved to write this book by seeing Wood's daughters on television.  If she truly cared about them, she might have left this book, with its reams of prurient speculation, in oblivion.  It scarely serves its subject, or anyone else.	2001-11-03

I am a devoted fan of Georgette Heyer, and have read a couple of her suppressed books--which number about six, all from her early publishing period, before she found her 'voice'.  This was among the suppressed titles, but her husband decided to republish it after her death.  I think her judgment on the matter was better, unfortunately.  <br />Heyer started publishing at age nineteen, and 'Simon' is obviously juvenilia.  Sometimes embarrassingly so--c.f. Simon's affection for small boys (!) and the fact that he falls in love with the putative heroine only after seeing her in male garb. (!!) And unfortunately, the middle ages is not her era.  The dialogue is heavy and not particularly realistic--far from her witty efforts in the Regency books.<br />There is the occasional good scene that suggests Heyer's future triumphs--such as Simon's encounter with his father.  But for the most part, this book should have stayed in the obscurity to which Heyer consigned it.	2001-09-29

That is, it's a biography of someone who's only famous because of the people they<br />married and/or bedded. The biographer is thus left with a dilemma; they have to convince us to care. In order to do this, they have to bring the person's character to life. This requires a novelist's talent, or a reasonable facsimile therein. It requires what David Cecil brought to Lady Caroline Lamb in \\"Young<br />Melbourne: a conviction that in spite of infuriating self-destructiveness, we understand the bond between them and the famous person, and why that person loved them. Nancy Schoenberger may have such talent; alas, it's not evident here. Lady Caroline Blackwood was rich, aristocratic, and beautiful. Okay, got that. Schoenberger also tries to convince us that Blackwood's a major writing talent, with very little success. Her work seems at all times slight, when it isn't cruel. She was also alcoholic from a very early age; a sloven; a depressive; a neglectful parent, and an unsuccessful wife. She was apparently also ambitious-she only married artists. There are odd gaps in the book, which seem to come from threatened lawsuits. Her children did not participate; Schoenberger says she understands why (and so do we) but the result leaves holes in the narrative. Two out of her three husbands are dead, and the other apparently didn't talk. So we don't know why they married her, and the book supplies few hints. Ms. Schoenberger maintains that Blackwood was an artist and a `muse.' Yes, but. From the<br />evidence here you could just as easily conclude that these not very wealthy arty types married her because she was rich as well as beautiful and they were crashing snobs. Ms. Schoenberger states she is `haunted' by Blackwood. Translation: she identifies rather too heavily with her subject. And we get, unfortunately, the smarmy romanticism typical of this type of `the-beautiful-and-the-damned' project. You need the talent of Fitzgerald to bring that off without gagging. What a book he would have made of this material! You get a clearer idea of Caroline Blackwood from her first husband's portrait of her than you do from this biography. That's the difference, I'm afraid, between genius and reportage.  Put another way:  a minor literary figure gets a minor-league biography.he-damned' project.

That is, each book is just a Young Jedi Knights book with a different cover and a heftier price tag.  The overall low writing level appears to be quite deliberate (check out the grammatical howler on the back cover&#8211;&#8220;But even in the midst of despair, while the most fiercest battle of all looms on the horizon, hope arises with the birth of one very special child. . .&#8221;  &#8216;Most fiercest&#8217;?)  But the strangled syntax, dumb dialogue, pathetic plotting, and clumsy writing are clearly designed to make the kids feel at home.      Some people who might have known better have been seduced by the fact that this book includes some much-anticipated plot points.   Luke&#8217;s son is born, Mara&#8217;s disease is cured, and Han and Leia are reconciled.  But these events are treated in such a cursory and vague way, they might as well not be there at all.  Much ink is spilt, however, on Anakin&#8217;s first kiss, an event treated like the Second Coming.  Like we care.  And that brings us to the Solo kids, a blandly-portrayed trio who&#8217;re an absolute blight on the landscape.  Everything is seen from their point of view, which means the low level of this enterprise is complete.<br />If you&#8217;re between the ages of nine and twelve, no doubt you will absolutely love this book.  If you are older than that, or even a sophisticated &#8216;tween, it&#8217;s profoundly disappointing.   I wouldn&#8217;t mind that it&#8217;s aimed at kids if it had the wit and creativity of good kid lit.  It doesn&#8217;t.  And take note, kids, you only had to pay $... for a YJK book.  Now they&#8217;re getting an extra chunk of change out of you for exactly the same product, and I do mean product.  This isn&#8217;t a book so much as a sausage&#8211;it&#8217;s exactly the same as the previous one, and it&#8217;s full of sawdust.<br />So the question is: when are they planning to release an adult Star Wars novel?

Amelia and Emerson go to Egypt; they dig for antiquities; there is a younger couple to provide the romantic subplot; they are in danger from thiefs/murderers/terrorists; someone is kidnapped; someone escapes; all ends happily.  The end.  The humour helps, but not enough.  I'm getting so that when someone attacks Amelia, I hope they'll do a lot of damage.  A bad sign.	2001-07-26

The Mitford sisters were power-groupies of various stripes.  Nancy liked historical tyrants (Louis XIV and Frederick the Great); Jessica liked Stalin; Unity and Diana liked Hitler; and Debo liked the Duke of Devonshire (she was a piker).<br />But at least Nancy and Jessica had some talent.  Unity was a rabidly unstable anti-semite, who committed suicide in an extraordinarily florid way.   Diana was a rabidly stable anti-semite.  Period.  So why should we care about this moon-faced woman in a succession of horridly unflattering hairstyles?  The author hasn't a clue. She keeps telling us that Diana is gorgeous, but at least understands that it isn't obvious from the photos in the book.  She keeps telling us that Diana was brilliant, but you sure couldn't tell from her behaviour.  When she was twenty-three, she hooked up with Oswald Mosley, and he is far more interesting than Diana, mainly because he is almost rivetingly despicable.  The behaviour of Diana and his sister-in-law toward him (and his behaviour towards them) beggars belief.  That this ridiculous creature dominated Diana's life is all you need to say about her.  It could be contained in a paragraph.  The author appears mightily constrained by the fact that her subject is still alive.  Without that fact, she might have had some pithy things to say; but still, Diana is an irrelevant footnote.	2001-07-18
US	53026337	RNURDJW98D3GS	0671578855	784554812	A Civil Campaign	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Wonderful!	This book is dedicated to four separate authors, but it's really a Heyer book-that is, pure high comedy.  The title recalls Heyer's \\"A Civil Contract\\" but the book itself really recalls Heyer at her comedic best-say \\"The Grand Sophy' or \\"Cotillion\\".  Not in plot, mind you.  In *tone.*<br />I haven't read all the previous Vorkosigan books, but those I have seem to follow roughly the same action-`n-angst formula (though Bujold's formidable sense of humor is at all times evident.)  Not this time, though.  <br />Bujold can plot like nobody's business; in romantic comedy, this is a real plus.  The major story line concerns Miles Vorkogisan's courtship of `the Vor next door' Ekaterin.  But there are other protagonists-Miles' brother Mark and his lady-love, Kareen (her parents violently disapprove),  Lord Dono Vorruyter (who, um, used to be Lady Donna); and Kareen's three sisters.<br />They all have their moments, but some of the high points are: Miles' disastrous dinner party (when Lord Dono stuffs his napkin in his mouth and snorts through his nose to keep from laughing, you're tempted to join him); Lord Dono's arrival back on Barrayar from his transformation on Beta (the efforts of his Armsmen to coach him in male mannerisms are a hoot); Cordelia's acting as Baba for Mark and Kareen (laser beam meet butter); and the climatic vote in Vorhartung Castle.<br />As always, Bujold has points to make, but here she makes them so lightly you both laugh and agree.  <br />I first read this book in a library copy; but after reading it I immediately ordered a copy for myself.  I only do this when I intend to read and reread the book.  Highly recommended.	2001-07-05

I, too, had suspicions that Norton was not the sole author of this book.  Or at least, she didn't reread a lot of her previous stuff when she wrote it, because discrepancies abound.  There are names misspelt (Joison?), people's appearances and coloring change, changing backstories, etc. etc.  Some things were just plain inaccurate.  For instance, Kethan says that he and Aylinn are not related by blood, when in fact they are cousins, according to &quot;The Jargoon Pard&quot;.  And in that book, his nature gifts were read as &quot;Magician&quot; where here he is Warrior.  And so forth.  We don't get much backstory on Firdun and Uta, either.  It feels rushed, and repetitive.  There are still some good things, though, and it is a must-read, I guess, for fans.  But doesn't she have an editor?  A lot of the mistakes could have been caught at the editing stage, and the carelessness looks like indifference to the fans of the books.	2001-06-03

Conquest is an encapsulated version of the reasons why the NJO is such a lousy series.  It's a cross between the Young Jedi Knights kids series (Anakin and his pals) and sub-par Trek (the Borg, er, Vong).

You pull for the Pressmans when the snobs snub  them in the beginning.  You jeer at them when their position goes to their  heads and they behave very, very badly.  But the really interesting part of  the book concerns how fashion and retailing REALLY work.  They appear to be  just an elaborate hoax on the consumer.  This book should be read in  conjunction with Teri Agin's &quot;The End of Fashion&quot; which shows the  comsumers are getting more and more skeptical and dissects the public  offerings of fashion stock (if you're fond of your money and want to keep  it, don't buy).

This book reads like a real-life opera bouffe, with real people making fools of the themselves in all-too-human ways.  Harris delves into the  Hitler demi-monde, and it's full of flaming nutbars--David Irving (a  British historian who just lost a huge lawsuit re his persistant Holocaust  denial), Billy F. Price (Texas millionaire and buyer of fake Hitler art),  Gerde Heideman (crazy investigative journalist), the executive staff of the  German magazine STERN (greedy corporate types) and the ultra-arrogant Hugh  Trevor-Roper (British lord and self-enchanted Professor of History at  Oxford).  They all bite the dust, courtesy of a bare-faced if not very  talented forger and their own need to believe.  This dissection of the  human condition is hugely funny, if a trifle uncomfortable to witness.	2000-08-14

This is a book about a Russian palace, Pavlovsk, a classically beautiful building which was designed by Charles Cameron and furnished by Maria  Feodorova, the daughter-in-law of Catherine the Great.  The palace managed  to escape the uncertain taste of descendants and the Revolutionary  commissars to somehow remain intact.  Then came the Second World War.  The  Nazis occupied the palace, stripped it to the walls and set it on fire.  It  was reduced to smouldering shell.  A devoted band of Russians devoted their  lives to restoring the palace to its former glory.  Their work is like a  detective story as they trace looted furnishings and use old blue-prints  and photos to rebuild.  Rebuild they did, and the palace is now open to the  public.  A heroic story, though not in the conventional sense.	2000-08-14

Do people, even famous ones, need some privacy?  Yes, they do, for our own  sakes as well as theirs.  Elderly people falling under the sway of  caretakers is a pretty common phenomenon, even in Hollywood (and it  happened to even as tough a man as James Cagney), but what has this to do  with the reason Groucho was famous?  Nothing, and we don't need every last  sad scummy detail.  This book is an unclean object, in my view.

US	53026337	R2V2U7SF3NLRAZ	0345435389	753640827	Rogue Planet (Star Wars)	Books	1	5	5	N	N	Disappointing	I can't honestly say this book disappointed me, because my expectations were next to nil.  Considering the last three Star Wars books, namely the TPM novelization (bland), Vector Prime (blech), and Onslaught (blah), I was careful to borrow, not buy, this book.    <br />I have never heard of Greg  Bear before, and I was certainly willing (given that I had no monetary  investment) to give him every chance to redeem the Del Rey franchise.  No  such luck, however. The book begins with what is obviously intended as a  traditional action set-piece, designed to hook the reader and pull them  into the story.  It's not very long before it becomes obvious that this  type of generic action is not Mr. Bear's forte.  He tries--very, very  hard--to bring the scene to life by describing the hell out of it--but it  just lays there, twitching.  The reader is both confused as to what is  actually happening and bored--when they should be excited--by the static  nature of the writing.  This chapter goes on for over thirty pages and ends  up as the literary equivalent of beating a dead horse.  A lot of energy is  expended, but no sparks ensue.  This also happens later in the book in the  second major action scene, Anakin v. the Blood Carver.  I hereby offer a  cookie to anyone who can tell me what actually took place.<br />Onward to  chapter two, which introduces a familiar name, and is mercifully shorter.   That's the case for the affirmative there.  In fact, you can forget reading  the Tarkin chapters completely--they're dull, at times inexplicable, and  add little or nothing to the story.<br />There is a sharp improvement in  chapter three, in which Mace Windu is given a large role, but the interest  is mitigated when Bear introduces a character who is thoroughly  irritating.<br />The relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the best part  of the book, but Bear can't make up his mind on it.  Part of the problem is  that his employers keep pulling his leash and so we get lots of dull  exposition on the completely unbelievable and thoroughly lame biotech ....;  the Vuzzhan Vong (isn't it enough that they bored us all to death in the  NJO?); and the Magister and Potentium stuff, which appears to be at best  marginally relevant to the story, such as it is.  The eventual fate of  Sekot is yet another over-used and very unlikely scifi cliche.  No doubt  Sekot will reappear under its own power in the last book of the NJO to save  the day.  I thought an integrated story arc was a great idea until it  arrived; if the main story itself isn't worth your attention, you can look  forward to twenty books full of tedium.  Number four and counting.	2000-05-27

I have never read Salvatore's other work--to judge by his reputation, it can't possibly be as bad as  this.  The book is limp, full of errors, botched characterizations, and  villains that are straight out of Ming the Merciless.  Just awful.  Did the  publisher know it was bad?  Sure they did, because perhaps the only good  section of the book was the one they chose to excerpt on the net and in  print.  They imagined, I suppose, that quality didn't matter, because hype  is all.  Wrong again.  A dire beginning for the NJO.	2000-03-02

Which is not to say it's good.  However, as the  fans have found out, it could have been much worse.<br />It's far too short  for the lot of plot it is expected to carry; and the usual Stackpole  elements obtain--plywood dialogue, plot cliches, and illogical behaviour  being his specialties.  The villains are lifelessly violent and dull. The  characters lecture each other endlessly until you want to yell &quot;Enough  already!&quot;  The next generation is being showcased, but they are still  tedium on the hoof.<br />That said, he is familiar with the Star Wars galaxy,  so the characterization errors of Vector Prime are missing and he does know  the continuity.  The action stuff is fine.  It's better, but still not up  to much.	2000-03-02

The death of you-know-who doesn't bother me--but the arbitrary way it occurred does (gotta do the deus ex machina thing now). New characters completely  cardboard.  Old characters blandly handled.  Plot stupid and cliched.   Salvatore gets numerous things hilariously wrong.  The previous comments  about it being 'dark' are baffling--it's not 'dark', it's just dull.

As somebody once said of Finnegan's Wake, it only makes sense when spoken aloud, with a faint brogue.

He does have the Irish instinct for wordplay--he calls his brother's fiancee &quot;The War Department&quot;.  But what gave &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; its power was a certain restraint and understatement.  None of that here. Since this book would never have seen print without the success of his brother's, Malachy will just have to endure the comparisons.  Get that money.	1998-07-29

During the course of research for that book, Levy read Nick Tosches' &quot;Dino:  Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams.&quot;  For those who haven't read it, it is one of those books with an novelish overcooked style.  Levy tries his own version here of that style here.  Big mistake:  he comes across as a self-conscious imitator.  Stick to your own style, kid, it's better, and it feels more natural.  This kind of thing also dates terribly, as anyone who has read &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; can attest.  Levy seems a bit uncomfortable with the subject matter, too; he is sensitive enough to divine its profound triviality.  So he tries hard to elevate it:  we get a lot of nonsense about Marilyn Monroe, for instance.  For anyone who wants a common sense estimation of her career, try  Clive James' essay in &quot;At the Pillars of Hercules&quot;.  The important thing about Frank Sinstra wa! s his music, not his protracted adolescence--so try some of the serious books on that, of which there are many.  For Martin, if you feel inclined, the Tosches biography is still better. Davis wrote several books on his own life. Lawford is not worth anybody's attention unless you count the grassy knoll brigade.  In other words, nothing here that need capture your attention or hasn't been done better elsewhere.	1998-07-19

The plot is a bit fragmented and it is shoehorned into the Jedi Academy Trilogy with some difficulty.  Very little Leia and Han, which is fine by me.  Almost none of their children, which is even better.  Wish the ban had extended to the insufferable Mara Jade.  I liked especially a differing viewpoint on several incidents already related in the series, and a consistent story line that stays with one character throughout, instead of that rigid, predictable switching back and forth from one set of characters to another, which mars most of the books.	1998-05-22

I notice that the previous customer reviews generally agree that &quot;Specter of the Past&quot; isn't as good as the original trilogy.  In fact, it is practically a rewrite, minus the suspense.  The original trilogy is held by many to be the high point of the Star Wars books, an opinion I don't share, though it certainly is better than most of them.  Zahn manages to make Leia a little less dull than usual, but he is no good at all with Luke, and seems to know it, as Luke is a bit-player here. Zahn also brings a few more characters into play, which helps a bit. Mara Jade's popularity with the faithful is a baffler, because her character never develops beyond a lot of sarcasm. But the relevation of the plot from the first robs the book of even fake suspense. The only thing we don't know:  when is Luke going to ever get laid?	1998-02-16

But the some of excesses that marred the prior book are here, too.  Lewis suffers from foodnote-itis; they can go on for pages and break up the rhythym of reading the book terribly. Either he should integrate the material into the text or he should use notes at the end of the book.  He still can't resist inserting himself into the book and making snide and tedious wisecracks, though compared to the Sellers book, he has definitely toned this element down.  But the out-of-left-field rhetorical question habit is worse here.  My absolute favourite: When discussing the film of Olivier's &quot;Hamlet&quot;, he says, &quot;Finally, am I alone in thinking the curtains of Gertrude's bed are spead like the lips of a giant vagina?&quot; Doh!  I rather think you are, pal.  Either the aforementioned comment is a put-on, or the editor was asleep at the--forgive me--swatch.  Speaking of sex, Lewis doesn't like to speak of it, at least directly.  He gives it a series of coy, creepy nicknames: &quot;rumpy-pumpy&quot;, &quot; and (another favourite) &quot;the bedspring Sonata&quot;.  What is it with the British, anyway? (That rhetorical question thing is catching).(P) It is also a bad sign that Lewis can't immediately let go of Sellers, and the first part of the book is loaded with references to him and comparisons to Olivier.  Apples and mangoes, friends. (P) But studded throughout these excesses, like jewels in *&%!, is some brilliant writing on Olivier's preformances and what excited him about acting.  You will just have to hold your nose to enjoy them. (P) And Olivier was great.  He was an indifferent father, a poor husband, a jealous colleague, and a manipulative friend, as Lewis makes clear.  His love, his energies, his reality went to acting.  He was not one of these modern actors who feel obliged to give dumb interviews about the whorishness of the acting profession, and how it is not really suited to a man. Olivier loved and respected his profession, and this book rightly celebrates his triumphs in unlikely (&quot;The Betsy&quot;), small (his wonderfully hostile and whiney Morarity in &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;), classical ('Richard III'); modern ('The Entertainer') and comedy (&quot;Moscow Nights&quot;).  My favourite Olivier performance is none of the above, however.  When I was a teenager, I stumbled upon a television showing of William Wyler's &quot;Carrie&quot; (an adaptation of Dreiser's &quot;Sister Carrie.&quot; This is an early fifties movie that was a terrible flop when released and was almost immediately forgotten.  Olivier is cast as Hurstwood.  His fate is horrifying, but such is the power of the performance Olivier gives, you watch until the very last frame. Sometimes this book can convey in words--fleetingly--what Olivier did on the screen.  So, in spite of the author's self-indulgences, I recommend it.	1998-01-12
