Two attempts were short-lived, but the third succeded at least in reaching the location of the supposed copper mines.  Hearne left a written record of these expeditions, but up until 1958 when Coppermine Journey was first published, his book was never widely available.  It's understandable why Mowat set about to rectify this, as Hearne's experiences are quite fascinating, and provide us with valuable insight about a region that had yet to experience much European influence.  In order to make the book more accessable, however, Mowat admits that a number of alterations had to be made.  As I'm not familiar with the original text, however, I cannot comment on the extent or quality of the changes that have been made.  But as it stands, Coppermine Journey is highly readable and enlightening work, one that has given me a greater understanding and appreciation of Canada's North.	2005-09-11

Moreover, most of the pictures in this book are not of the redheaded woodpecker, most being of the gila woodpecker, and a few pileated woodpeckers as well.  Also, each page of text has a small drawing of a woodpecker at the top.  Is it a redheaded woodpecker?  Nope.  For some reason it's an ivory-billed woodpecker.  As this book is meant for young children, I could imagine that all of this would cause some amount of confusion.  Added to this is the fact that the information is very basic.

There, like many of the other captives, he spent some of his time documenting his life and experiences through drawings.  These drawings were sometimes collected into booklets and either sold or, as in the case of the pictures used for this book, given away as gifts.  In this case, the booklet had been given to General William Tecumseh Sherman when he visited the prison in which Bear's Heart was being held in November of 1876.  Although intended for children, this book is actually suitable for everyone as Bear's Heart's pictures are a fascinating first-hand account of one Cheyenne's changing world.	2005-08-03

J. Allan Hynek originally worked on Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force's attempt to \\"study\\" and ultimately debunk, the numerous UFO sightings that were occuring after 1947.  A trained scientist, he was a skeptic at first, but soon came to the conclusion that in a very small number of cases, something truly unexplained had occured.  In a field where much has been published that is simply outrageous and fabricated, The Hynek UFO Report is rational, logical and realistic.  I myself am somewhat of a skeptic, and I appreciate the manner in which Hynek addresses the issue; while still not totally convinced that UFOs are alien spacecraft, I have to concede that something unexplained has been happening in the skies over many nations on this planet.	2005-04-11

Hawks & Owls of the Great Lakes Region and Eastern North America, therefore, is an excellent introductory guide.      Each species has between two to four pages devotes to it.  The majority of this space consists of photographs, depicting the species in flight and perched; save for a few, the photographs are crisp and clear.  Aside from the brief introductory note and the more brief \\"nature notes,\\" text is devoted to pointing out key features of the given species.  Size, characteristics while perched and in flight, differences between males, females and juveniles, flight traits, and distinguishing calls are dealt with for each species, while relevant information concerning morphs and second year plummage, etc. is included when applicable.

This guide was written--reluctantly--to lessen some of that frustration.  Reluctantly, because, while the authors wish to indroduce the owl to new generations of birders, at the same time they are very concerned about adverse influence that birders can have on owls.  The book consists of two parts: an introduction to birding for owls, and the owls of North America.  In the latter, each species that is found in North America is discussed to some degree.  While the Whiskered Screech Owl, which only occurs near the Mexican-American border in southern Arizon, only has two paragraphs devoted to it, other species are covered by a number of pages.  Information is largely anecdotal and easy to read.  At least one photograph of most species is included, the quality of which is usually excellent.	2005-03-15

But every so often, the species has to contend with a sharp decline in its favoured pray and is forced to expand its range southward.  The winter of 2004-2005 is one of those rare occurences, and for the first time in several decades great grays are being regularly spotted by local birders.   <br /> <br />For people such as myself who are not that familiar with the species, Ghost of the Forest is an excellent book from which to learn more about this fascinating species.  The author and photographer, Michael S. Quinton, spent several years in Yellowstone National Park and Island Park photographing the great gray in all aspects of its lifecycle.  In the end, his persistance (which, he admits, sometimes caused him to foresake what \\"little common sense\\" he had left [p. 81]) was rewarded with a number of striking photographs that capture the unique character of North America's largest species of owl.

The goldfinch is a bird that can be easily attracted to the backyard by stocking a feeder with thistle-like seeds.  (It is largely due to feeders that the American goldfinch is so recognizeable to most, as it has made the species much more common.)

Well written and easy to read, the book outlines the various aspects of birding, everything from bird migrations and bird banding to the art of bird watching.  Unfortunately, since 1975, much of what is discussed has also become somewhat dated, in particular when it comes to the state of ornithological research.  Interesting, however, for the bibliophile, is an annotated list of pre-1943 bird books, which comprises Appendix D.  Overall, while I enjoyed reading this book and did derive some ideas and useful information, I would have to say that A Guide to Bird Watching is not an essential book on birding and would recommend looking for something more recent.	2005-02-21

This book, therefore, is an excellent resource for those who want a more indepth understanding of the species, but who lack the desire to subject themselves to reading scientific studies.  My only complaint with the book is that in a few instances the author was repetative, in particular in regards to flocking and nest-site selection and excavation.

As a result, Charcoal believed that, according to white man's law, this would result in his being hanged.  So he decided that he would die in the traditional manner for a warrior who knew that he was going to die, by \\"sacrificing\\" himself, that is, by seeking out battle so that he can die a warriors death.  I have to say that this was a fascinating read.  It is an unflattering expose of the manner in which Canada went about conquering its part of the prairies, how the various Indian bands were herded into reservations, where they lived on a starvation diet and were expected to adopt the European concepts of law and \\"civilization\\".	2005-02-01

This his riveting first-hand account of that desperate battle, which saw the better part of his division wiped out, having unexpectedly landed amidst two Waffen SS divisions.  It is a story of heroic men who valiantly fought on under near hopeless circumstances, as well as a testament to the unfortunate ineptitude of the operational planners.  Trying to win the war quickly by a quick thrust into Germany in itself is questionable, but what really gets me is the fact that effort was not more concerted and co-ordinated.  Case in point, the lack of air support.  If this was to be the big push to end the war, one would expect that air support of the operation would have been deemed a high priority.  But as Urquhart points out, it rarely materialized, and this appears to have been instrumental in Market Garden's failure.  This book was very enlightening, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the war, in particular the European Theatre.   <br /> <br />On an incidental note: Urquhart mentions on several occasions one of the few Canadians present at the battle: a unique character by the name of Leo Heaps.  Heaps subsequently published two books about his exploits at Arnhem: \\"Escape from Arnhem\\" and \\"The Grey Goose of Arnhem\\".  Having read the latter, I would recommend it as well.	2005-01-31

More specifically, I was hoping that it would perhaps clarify the reasons why there was a conviction, as the documentary clearly showed that there was reasonable doubt that Michael Peterson murdered his wife, and that Peterson's sexual preferences as well as local politics had a part to play in his conviction.  Unfortunately, it soon became evident that this book is flawed on many levels.  One example is the total lack of objectivity.  Aphrodite Jones is clearly convinced that Michael Peterson is the murderer, and as a result, she spends a great deal of effort trying to prove that he's a sociopath.  She finally rests her case lamely in chapter 54 in which she simply lists the characteristics of a sociopath.  I guess that she figured that after all of her \\"evidence\\" that we would all have an \\"ah ha!\\" moment and be convinced of his guilt.  But much of her \\"evidence\\" is gossipy trifles gleaned from interviews with people who had come to believe that Michael Peterson was the murder--most notably the Atwater family.  But not only was this book poorly researched, the writing is quite poor as well.  Aphrodite Jones is just not a good writer, and leaves me wondering how she became one in the first place, and who would have entrusted her with covering such an important and controversial case.  Well, whatever the case, it would seem to me that in the end there is reasonable doubt that Michael Peterson was responsible for his wife's death, and so I guess that this is yet another instance where the American justice system has failed.	2005-01-31

Only recently have I decided to read this book in the original German, and as a result I have had to significantly change my assessment of this the English translation.  In its own right it is a readable book, and does convey to some extent what Bloem wrote.  However, a considerable amount has been left out--in some cases this is not all that bad of a thing--that, although perhaps a little tedious for the general reader, is information lost to those would regard this as a source for understanding the early stages of the war from a German perspective.      My initial review:    Walter Bloem was an aspiring novelist and officer in the reserves in the year 1914.  He had reached a point in his life when he felt he could devote himself more to his passion of writing and the future looked promising--but in August 1914, that all changed with the outbreak of war.  In a matter of days he went from being a gentleman and novelist to Captain and company commander in the 12th Brandenburg Grenadiers, which was part of III Corps in Kluck's Army.  As an accomplished writer, what we have in The Advance from Mons is an astute and very readable account of the early weeks of the war from the perspective of a frontline officer.  An excellent first-hand account--a must read for those with an interest in the Great War.	2005-01-31

While I'm not all that convinced about the \\"paranormal\\" I found the stories to be quite interesting, and some certainly made me think that there may just be some plausibility to things like UFOs and ghosts.

Expecting it to be a similar historical account, this time on the Battle of Little Big Horn, it quickly became evident that this was in fact a work of fiction based on eye-witness accounts--so, essentially, a non-fiction novel.  Nevertheless, I read it in its entirety, and found it to be, for the most part, a good read.  Brown attempts to bring to life the experiences of individual participants, and in this he largely succeeds.  However, the story mainly focuses on the American invaders, with only a few chapters devoted to the Indians.  This makes the book seem rather unbalanced and incomplete, and therefore somewhat of a disappointment.	2005-01-09

This book documents a number of such occurnces (primarily in North America), and for someone such as myself who has never experienced such a thing, or who, to be honest, hasn't really given it much thought, the stories have caused me to wonder whether there really is something to it.  It's a perplexing and ultimately unexplainable phenomena: how and why could such things occur?  And as a result, it's easy to dismiss these stories as figments of the immagination, wishful thinking, delusions, etc.  I'm not so sure that this is a wise thing to do now that I've read this book.<br />Overall, I found the book to be well written and enlightening.  My only complaint is that some of the stories were gleaned from other books or Internet discussion boards.  With the latter in particular, it's difficult to say just how credible the story is, since anyone can write anything under the cloak of anonymity.  Stories such as these are best documented in person.	2004-10-25

It has given me a better understanding of the Lakota people, in particular the significance of visions.  The whole process of &quot;civilizing&quot; the American West was a dubious undertaking, the illegitimacy of which has, unfortunately, become distorted by rhetoric and romanticism.  This illegitimacy is something that America has naturally been reluctant to face, and it something that will likely never be rectified.  Sad really, as what happened to the Lakota, among many others, contradicts quite blatantly the nobel principles that America has, since it's creation, claimed to stand for.  Black Elk's story has heightened my understanding of the injustices that the Lakota and other Indians faced.  It is an excellent source for those who want a more balanced and truthful account of what happened during c. 1870 to 1890 on the American frontier.	2004-10-07

The popularity of his field guide was based on the system that he devised whereby he included coloured plates of each bird, and noted key identifying features of each bird, thus allowing the birder to make quick and confident identifications.  The system is not fool-proof, of course, as some species closely resemble one another, but oversall, the tricks one learns from the Peterson field guide provides an excellent foundation for the aspiring birder.  A number of other guides have come along, but I still find this one more than suitable, and therefore the one that I continue to rely on.	2004-09-30

In this volume, he turns his attention to once sensational murders that have now been forgotten.  There are eight in all, Elizabeth Tilford, age 50, who poisoned her 31 year-old husband Tyrell, to the brutal murder of young Lizzie Anderson at the Goderich Fair.  Boyle states that one of the reasons he wrote this book is to show that crimes back when capital punishment existed in Canada were just as heinous as they are now, and he certainly has proven that to be the case.  The book is well written, and each chapter nicely developed with detail, yet not tedious and/or gruesome.  My only complaint is the occasional poor proof-reading--in particular the first chapter where Sidney (or is it Sydney?) Murrell's name is not consistant (in some cases it is spelled both with an \\"i\\" and a \\"y\\" in the same paragraph).

I truly found this book to be fascinating.  It recounts the story of scores of shipwrecks from the earlies know to just prior to the books publication (1969--reprinted in 1973 as a pocketbook by Pan).  The stories are tragic, harrowing, and at times downright bizarre.  Each chapter deals with a section of the coast, and as each section has seen numerous wrecks, only a few can be discussed in any depth.  The book is well written and keeps the reader's attention by not becoming mired in trivial fact and exhaustive description.

I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of this kind of pulp fiction, but I thought I'd make an exception with this series.  Sure enough, the writing is mediocre, the characters either romanticized (as is the case with the Indians) or inane, the dialogue downright absurd at times, and the plot somewhat erratic.

Nigel Davies offers some sound and practical advice, and does so in a highly readable and down-to-earth manner.

Boyce Richardson has to be commended for this excellent book, and the work that he did on behalf of the Cree, whose land was appropriated and flooded to facilitate this project.

As one can derive from this title, the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis, and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar (in my opinion, at least) insights.<br />In particular, Fine discusses the following players: Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, Steinetz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, and Botvinnik.  For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players, Fine's anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating.  What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players, and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess.  <br />For instance, on page 22 he states: \\"The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masterbation.  This is, of course, completely repressed.  Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent, again part of the homosexual complex.\\" <br />Oh, really?  And here I thoight that chess was a game, to be played for fun and enjoyment, or in some cases competatively.  I can't quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a \\"desire for mutual masterbation\\"--well, how could I, because I can't, since I'm repressing it.  Well, that's just pure bunk, in my opinion.  Fortunately, this book isn't entirely like this, so it does have its merits, but it clearly isn't must-read chess literature.	2004-07-02

I did not find this book to be at all convincing, and did in fact have to wonder at times if the whole story was concocted by a group of friends, perhaps, as a means of amusing themselves and publishing a book in the process.  <br />While I enjoy a good ghost story, from the very beginning I couldn't help but think that there was something fishy about this.  Trust me, I'm by no means a sceptic; but there's just something about the stories that seems too contrived.  Part of the problem, however, may in fact be that the book is not that well written; it was at times quite simplistic, and the author's attempts to infer what the spirits wanted by doing what they did was downright lame at times.<br />You aren't missing much by not reading this book.  For really good Canadian ghost stories, I would suggest Bluenose Ghosts by Helen Creighton, a folklorist who collected the stories along with numerous others from people who had nothing to gain by telling their stories; hence they are much more credible.	2004-05-09

E. Coppard) enlists with the 6th Battalion, Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment.  By early 1915, he is in France, where, after becoming a member of a machine gun crew, he participates in a number of significant battles, until he finally receives his Blighty near the end of the war.    Using journals that he kept at the time, the author worked on the book following his retirement; the manuscript was then sent to the Imperial War Museum, which was endeavouring to collect such memoirs for posterity.  The Imperial War Museum subsequently published the book in 1969, and has ever since been recognized as a lucid testament to the experiences of the common British soldier during the war.  It is truly an excellent read, filled with interesting and harrowing details of trench warfare.    A must read for anyone interested in the First World War.	2004-05-09

This is one of those books.<br />I'll admit that I borrowed this book from the library, and am not sure, therefore, whether the book I borrowed is the original binding.  This book has a plastic spiral bind, and consists of 5x8&quot; (8.5x11&quot; cut in half) pages, printed on one side only.  <br />Whatever the case, the book consists of a number of short accounts that Colombo gathered over the course of several years.  Some are from old newspapers or out-of-print books, but most are replies to queries that he made through newspapers or on the radio.  All in all, the stories are quite fascinating and for the most part pretty convincing.<br />The quality of the stories compensates for the (in my case at least) the homemade appearance of the publication; the latter would be even less of a factor if it wasn't for the fact that seemingly every page has about two typos.  Another minor complaint is the fact that a few of the stories deal with UFOs and not ghosts.  <br />Overall, though, Ghosts Galore! is an interesting and entertaining read, a book that I think anyone interested in the paranormal would enjoy.	2004-04-25

I really enjoy a good ghost story, which is why I gleefully bought this book (very cheap, thankfully).  Long ago, when a mere teen, I read a book or two by Holzer, and can still remember having the feeling that it seemed contrived.  So I can't say I wasn't prepared for it.  Still, I'm disappointed.  Holzer's accounts are quite simplistic and at times downright silly.  If they are based on actual events, then they are written in such a way that makes their plausability so suspect, that it's impossible to take the book seriously.  Therefore, it's mere fluff, simply a means of wasting a few hours if you've got nothing better to do.  And if you're in no mood to get spooked.	2004-03-14

Unfortunately, the events of the last century have done much to tarnish the image of Germans, and in Canada this has meant that the role Germans played in making this nation has been unjustly overlooked or ignored.  Germans were among the first settlers in Ontario, and throughout the 19th century the industrious German community flourished, primarily in the Waterloo region.  <br />Overall, Little Paradise is an enjoyable and informative read; but it is clearly the work of an amateur historian.  One instance where I found the author to be incorrect was when he discussed the early Indian occupants of Ontario: he seems to have believed that the Neutrals, Hurons, Mississauga, and Mohawks were contemporaries, and that the Hurons had resided in the Waterloo region.  In fact, the Neutrals and Hurons were contemporaries, but they were destroyed by the Iroquois in the 1640's.  The Iroquois then used southern Ontario as a hunting ground until they were displaced by the Mississauga, who occupied the region until European settlement.  At this time, the Mohawk settled in Ontario, having been granted land their for their alliegence to the British monarchy.<br />Such an oversight suggest that other such inaccuracies can be expected.	2004-02-16

In total, 55 graves were discovered, from which the remains of 367 individuals were removed.  The book deals with each grave individually, although in most cases the description consists of little than a short paragraph.  Included are a number of figures and plates.  All in all, the report gives one interesting insight into the lives and customs of the Neutral Indians, and a better understanding of pre-European occupancy of southwestern Ontario.	2004-02-16

Among them are: Anna Jameson, Henry Scadding, Samuel Strickland, Catharine Parr Trail, and Major W. Ross King.  Despite this format, one gets an excellent understanding of the attitude that the early settlers had towards wildlife, and how some wildlife was from very early on adversely affected by human settlement.  Included are a number of illustrations by the W. Fraser Sandercombe, who compiled the extracts, and I have to say they are quite excellent.

Over all, Seaton does do a fine job of summarizing the development of the Prussian army from the time of the Great Elector to the Franco-Prussian War.  But the discussion of the German Army in the period from 1870-1888 is a little more disjointed as the complexity of the system and the numerous variations in uniforms, in particular, make a brief overview somewhat difficult and incomplete.  Unfortunately, the overview of the command structure is too brief, and almost no mention is made of training, exercises, and the army's influence on society and politics, etc.  The plates are fairly good.  There are a number of illustration (including one of the cat and dog meat market in Paris, which really has no purpose being in the book), as well as a few photographs (including a couple of captured French cannons (neat--but why?)).  More photos (especially of individual soldiers) would have been useful in place of the illustrations, in my opinion.  Unfortunately, I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed, but the book is still a good introduction to the topic.	2004-02-09

At first, I'll admit, the going was a little slow, as the writing is somewhat fanciful and the dialogue stilted, but this awkwardness became less of an issue the more I became enthralled by the story.<br />Having seen the movie in advance, it was interesting to see how much the movie had in fact diverged from the story.  Actually, aside from many of the characters, the setting, and the general premise of the story, the movie is quite different from the book.  So much so, that it is safe to say that the movie has totally failed to capture the true spirit of the novel, and is little more than the typical Hollywood historical romance.  The most unfortunate aspect of the movie, however, is how the &quot;patriotic&quot; element was incorporated--this is simply not in the book.  I do have to say that the movie in its own right is good, but it utterly fails as an adaptation.<br />The is no doubt that Last of the Mohicans is a classic.  It is a book that I know will be reread a number of times before my time comes, and I'm sure with each reading, new meaning and insight will be found in its pages.	2004-02-09

It is essentially an overview of all anthropolgical information known about the Huron Indians, who at the time of contact with Europeans in the early 1600's were settled in a relatively small tract of land between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay.  There are three main sources of contemporary information on the Huron, the writings of: 1) Samuel Champlain; 2) Gabriel Sagard; 3) The Jesuits (on the Jesuit Relations).  All of these writings are incomplete in their observations and tainted by bias.  But regardless of this, they provide us with a rare glimpse into the lives of Native Americans who had been little disrupted by direct contact with Europeans.  Trigger does an excellent job of summarizing and interpreting the information from these sources, and does so in a highly readable manner.  This book is by no means a dry academic work, but is rather a very accesable social and historical study, one that should be read by anyone with an interest in Canadian or Ontarian history.	2004-02-09

As MacKenzie is most famous for his political agitations and leading role in the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada, much of the book deals with his life leading up to the latter event.  The author draws on a number of contemporary sources--including MacKenzie's own writings--and quotes from them regularly.

As one can tell from the title, it is geared towards those modern (North) Americans who are really strapped for time, but still want to cook their own meals.  The cardinal sins for the traditional cook--using the microwave and canned goods--are a must for these recipes.  Of course the instructions for each state that they can be made in 15 minutes or less, but seriously... who are we kidding?  Cooking takes time, because there's more to cooking than just cooking.  Moreover, the cooking times she suggests do little more than heat the food and give the appearance of being cooked--which compromises both flavor and quality, I think.  Still, the book does have good recipes.	2004-02-04

Violence is for the most part a learned trait, one that, while in most cases not as destructive as is the case with men, women are equally capable of resorting to.

At the centre of the agitation in Upper Canada (Ontario) was the Scotish-born newspaper publisher and sometimes reform politician William Lyon MacKenzie.  Since his arrival in Upper Canada, he was a critic of the political system, which failed to consider the needs of the majority of the population and was dominated by an exclusive elite--the so-called Family Compact--centred around the capitol York (now Toronto).  MacKenzies vehement criticisms, tireless advocacy of democratic reform made him quite unpopular among the ruling elite, but he garnered a considerable amount of support from farmers and some liberal-minded gentlemen.  His agitation played a significant role in the gradual slide toward &quot;rebellion&quot; in 1837.  But whereas he was an astute political agitator, he was utterly hopeless as a leader of an uprising, and it quickly degenerated into a farce.  The Firebrand is an illuminating biography of this fascinating yet perplexing man; it is a lucid and sometimes whimsical account of his life and role in the rebellion, and I believe captures the spirit of the times quite well.	2004-02-02

Child served during the latter stages of the First World War as an officer with a Canadian Field Artillery battery.  Drawing from this experience, he wrote God's Sparrows, which was first published in England in 1937.  The story centres on the Thatchers, a wealthy family from \\"Wellington\\" whose comfortable lives are thrown assunder by the outbreak of the war.  As the war progresses, and the two sons (as well as several relations) enter the service, reality as it was known disintegrates and is replaced by flux, uncertainty, and confussion.  This is most strongly seen in the relationship between the main protagonist Dan Thatcher with his brother Alistair, his cousin Quentin, and his friends Cynthia and Beatrice Elton.  Like most novels about the First World War written during the inter-war period, God's Sparrows is an anti-war novel.  Although I felt the writing to be a little awkward in parts, over all the novel was a powerful and evocative work.  It is unfortunate that this work has slipped into obscurity as its message is still quite relevant.  <br />The McClelland & Stewart edition published in 1978 is part of the New Canadian Library (NCL) pocketbook series.	2004-02-02

Essentially what happened was that the Government deemed several thousand male Ukrainians to be &quot;Austrians&quot; and placed them in camps under the auspices of being &quot;prisoners of war&quot;; many more were deemed to be &quot;enemy aliens&quot; and were therefore issued identification papers and required to report regularly to the police of NWMP.  Unfortunately with a text so brief, the author is reduced to making generalizations with a minimum of references; one statement that struck me as needing further clarification was that the Ukrainians &quot;joined the Canadian army in record numbers&quot; by either &quot;misrepresenting where they had been born&quot; and/or using the name &quot;Smith&quot;.  Just what constitutes &quot;record numbers&quot; is not stated.  I'm also inclined to believe that since many of these Ukrainians were recent immigrants, and their affection for the homeland still strong, many would have been reluctant to join an army that was allied with the nation (until 1917) that was oppressing their people.  But I guess when one has a certain agenda, one sometimes has to create certain myths in the course of debunking others.	2004-02-01

Several years ago, Hope Edelman wrote a book that was supposed to help women deal with the loss of a mother. She did this so that other women would not have to go through the ordeal she did. Specifically, the ordeal of not having an adequate reference for dealing with such a tragedy. <br />Her efforts resulted in the widely popular Motherless Daughters. <br />With the publication of the book came a flood of letters from women who wanted to share their own experiences with Edelman. <br />In response, Edelman has compiled many of these letters into the compact Letters from Motherless Daughters. The purpose of this book is to show the many ways in which women have come to deal with their tragic losses. <br />After reading letter upon letter, I too realized something that she claimed she was at first unaware of: one never gets over the loss of an important person. All one can do is either choose to mourn and dwell on the past, or choose to grow from the loss and continue on with life. <br />Many of the letters are poignant, while others are heart-wrenching. Yet others display a true sense of courage, while some reflect the confusion and agony that has invaded the daughter's life. <br />Reading such letters is beneficial to a certain degree--they open one's eyes to the bitter reality of dealing with death, and they allow one to see that others have also experiences similar feelings. <br />Although these letters do serve a crucial purpose, they are only letters.

I'm not sure why everyone else has rated this book so highly--I've found it to be quite banal, and sometimes down-right painful to read.  Johnson comes across as a bland, naive and gullable girl who tries to play up to Kerouac in order to win his dubious affection.  Her letters are written in a most childish and lame manner, and I can't believe that she was published a few years later.  I hate to say such a thing, but it's true.  Needless to say, their affair--calling it a love affir is streaching it a tad--eventually ends, and now forty years later she's decided to publish their exchange of letters in order to assure her fifteen minutes of fame.  The fact that this book does provide a little insight into Kerouac keeps it from being two stars.	2004-01-23

Ontario has numerous natural wonders, quaint small towns, and historical landmarks--all of which are within a few hours drive.<br />For those unable to undertake the excursions, or who have no inclination to go polluting through them, will still enjoy this book immensely, as I have.  Ron Brown is an excellent writer, and describes each excursion with clarity and the right balance of information and anecdote.	2004-01-23

Although he has consulted numerous works and records, it is most likely that due to fog-of-war or willful supression that the incidents about which he writes are but a fraction of those that occurred.  <br />Friendly Fire in the Civil War is an interesting book, and not without its merits.  But overall I find that there is just something about Garrison's writing that makes his books too simplistic, and therefore difficult to read.	2004-01-23

The Mens Movement began as a result of the Womens Movement, when men began to be challenged by women to view and treat them differently, \\"as equals\\" as it were.  Some men reacted by looking at themselves more closely, and the whole concept of masculinity, and began to recognize that men in fact were also victims of patriarchy.  Men are expected to conform to a certain ideal that defines them as \\"real men\\" and this, traditionaly, (according to feminists and members of the mens movement) has meant objectifying women, being dominant and oppressive, violent, competitive, etc.  The articles in this book address these issues, and in some cases document how men attempted to redefine masculinity.  Now that it has been thirty years since the book was published, it is safe to say that the Mens Movement hasn't been a great success, although men have changed somewhat (whether feminists want to admit it or not).  Why the Mens Movement has failed is a matter of debate.  All things considered, I just don't think that men at that time felt any necessity to change--it's hard to convince someone who has it good that they need to change--and that others felt threatened or simply thought the whole concept amusing.  And then there are the feminists who have derided such initiatives by men, claiming that men, as the dominant sex, don't need liberation, and that such an idea simply constitutes a backlash, etc. etc.  Whatever the case, the book does after all this time contain much that is relevant and useful, and if you're interested in the subject may be worth tracking down.	2004-01-23

Michele Landsberg professes to stand up for the rights of women and children, yet she does so in such a bigoted manner, that I find it hard to see just how she thinks that she is advancing their cause.  She is simply another example of how feminism has degenrated into simple and outright male-bashing.  Here are some examples:<br />\\"women... are captives of a language that obliderates the female and exalts the male...\\" [p. 8]<br />\\"Men have been enjoying affirmative action all along.  Now it is time, not for affirmative action for women, but for the de-privileging of men.\\" [p. 43]<br />\\"Just as I wrote the last paragraph, a book about joint custody landed with a gloomy thump on my desk.  It is filled with outraged howls of pain from fathers who have been deprived of their children.\\" [p. 266]<br />And so on, and so forth.  This book is FILLED with arrogant, self-righteous and smug comments such as these.  Not surprisingly, she's still at it.  Read any of her articles since this book was published, and you'll find similar male-bashing.	2004-01-23

The book is an insightful portrayal of the mindset of a First World War pilot, as well as the advent and growth of the small Belgian contribution to the air war.

The game was still in its infancy and considerably different from the modern game, but men who played it were athletes through-and-through, and the games as hotly contested (if not more so) than they today.  Games were played before large (often disproportionately female (his wife was an ardent hockey fan)) and freezing crowds, on ice often of dubious quality.  Play was often rough and rowdy, and more often than not there were goals a-plenty.  Even for a player like Cyclone Taylor, there wasn't much money to be earned playing the game, and they played for the most part for the love of the game, a passion that I don't think modern players truly can attain.  Unfortunately, almost no other hockey biography of this kind exists, to my knowledge, and virtually no studies on the early days of hockey.  Which is a shame since the game is an integral aspect of Canada's heritage.	2004-01-21

I found the narrative to be excellently written for the most part, although there were a few awkward spots.  The one real detracting aspect of the book was the lack of a roster.

Birds of Ontario lists every known (wild) bird to have been observed in the province of Ontario and privides information concerning identification, measurements, and seasonal residency.  For migrating birds, average and earliest/last arrival/departure date is provided based on observations by naturalist clubs and individual researchers.  For the common birds of Ontario a grid-marked map of the province is provided for Christmas Bird Counts and Breeding Bird Surveys; the former lists (per grid) the average number of birds observed per 100 party-hours, while the latter the average number per 50 stops.  Both are based on information collected between 1968 and 1977.  Given this, and the fact that the book was published in 1985, suggests that the information could be now dated considering the amount of habitat destruction that has occurred since then, not to mention other ecologically-related matters.  For the average birder, this book is not necessarily essential--especially for $150--but if you are fortunate enough as I was to come across one cheap, it is certainly a useful volume to add to one's library.	2004-01-19

There relationship is essentially broken, but the reasons for this are not simple, and this essentially is the focus of the story.  <br />Throughout the novel, Mrs. Bentley--who is never named because the work is written in the form of journal entries--continuously explores their history, their personalities and the effect of their confined lifestyle upon themselves and one another.  <br />Over the course of their residence in Horizon she comes to realize that the break-down of their relationship, is not so much the fault of Philip's conduct, as we are first led to believe, but fact that both have allowed themsleves to become victims of circumstance.<br />As For Me and My House is definitely a work worth studying, but like I initially stated, I question whether it can really be considered one of the great Canadian novels.	2004-01-19

The Ojibway Nation is one of several books that he wrote, in which he attempted to inform Euro-Canadians/Americans about the history and culture of the Ojibway people.  Included are chapters dealing with the Ojibway language, government and religious practices, as well as their conflicts with the Souix and Iroquois.  He speaks of the Ojibway as a noble and dignified people who have risen to become one of the great Indian nations.  Yet he is a man influenced by his association with Europeans, and is not above referring to Natives in general as &quot;backward heathens&quot; for resisting attempts at Christianization and continuing to hunt instead of becoming agriculturalists.  Copway rightly believed, however, that by this time (the 1850s) it was clear that European colonization was irreversable, and that in order for Indians to survive, they had to settle their differences and unite.  He proposed that land should be set aside between the north bank of the Missouri river and the state of Wisconsin.  Here all the Indian peoples of North America could settle; the territory would be barred to Europeans to allow for the Indians to educate themselves and form a government.  When this was accomplished, the territory would them petition to enter the union as a state.  A bold but logical plan, but as we all know, the American government had other plans for the West.  Although this last aspect revolves more around the United States, the majority of the book deals with Canada, in particular the Ojibway of Canada West (how Ontario).  The Ojibway Nation is therefore an important piece of Canadiana.	2004-01-16

One example is at the beginning of the history of Orangeville when he states &quot;the Mississauga tribe lived along the Credit River.  To the north... were the Petun or Tobacco Nation...&quot;  Well, actually these tribes were not contemporaries.  The Petun existed up until the 1640s, when along with the Huron and Neutral nations, they were defeated and dispersed by the Iroquois.  The Mississauga are Ojibway, and they came later after the Ojibway had driven out the Iroquois.

There's no denying that Krakauer is a good writer, and that the events and people of which he writes are interesting.  But the fact of the matter remains is that the &quot;past-time&quot; that these people have devoted--and in some cases sacrificed--their lives is an excellent example of man's propensity to forsake reason and logic in the pursuit of illusory goals.  To devote oneself to climbing mountains for the sake of thrills and notarity ultimately serves no useful purpose, and simply gratifies the ego of the climber.  Sadly, the mindset of the mountain climber resembles that of the gallant soldier of yore who with nonsensical and misguided idealism would willingly shirk all concern for self for the sake of some ultimately pointless objective.  Were these people to come to the rational conclusion it should not be man's place to conquer everything on this planet (and subsequently turn that which is conquered into a gigantic playground) and that one can attain much greater and sincere rewards by revering the mountain from a distance, they'd have my undying respect.

It should come as no surprise that some people of any given occupied country will feel it in their best interest to collaborate.  For some young men in France following 1940, this meant joining the Waffen SS.  Initially, the Germans were reluctant to allow foreigners into the ranks of the Waffen SS, less so with the Wehrmacht.  But the high casualty rate among Waffen SS units, and the difficulty to obtain acceptable recruits among Germans, the Waffen SS began enlisting certain foreigners, primarily from nordic nations.  Eventually the French were deemed acceptable as well, and efforts were made to form a Division, but in the end only a few thousand men were secured.  These men did see some service in the East, and remnants of the unit were present at the defense of Berlin.   <br />This book does serve to document the envolvement of French in the Waffen SS, but it is written from the standpoint that these men were \\"brave\\" and \\"heroic\\" soldiers fighting for freedom Europe and not the twisted ideology of the Nazis.  It does nothing to reveal the true motivations of these men, and does not question their lack of morality.	2004-01-13

Although life for the Wilders is somewhat more settled and secure than it would be on the prairie, it is still a struggle to make a living off the land.  But it is a good life, one that revolves around the family and the simple pleasures of rural life such as attending the fair.  I found this book to be one of the more enjoyable of the series and find it unfortunate that Wilder did not write more about her husband.	2004-01-13

When I first read this book as a child I was thoroughly mesmerized by Wilder's evocative portrayal of pioneer life in the \\"big woods\\" of western Wisconsin.  The book's pertinant underlying theme is the importance of the family unit, and the perserverance of the human spirit through times of hardship.  It should not be forgotten, however, that the book is an idealization, a toned-down version, of pioneer life.  Wilder was later accused of distorting and fabricating her stories, an aligation which shocked her because it had been her intention to write stories, not history.  But that, I guess, is irrelevant to the children that this book--and those of the series--was intended for.	2004-01-13

It was, therefore, while doing the research on these non-German \\"volunteers\\" that I came across George Lepre's Himmler's Bosnian Division, which documents the story of the 13th Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS \\"Handschar\\" (hereafter Handschar).  In its original form as a thesis, this work was awarded the Sydney Zebel History Award from Rutgers University.<br />The first divisions of the Waffen-SS were essentially purely German in manpower, but starting with the 5th SS Panzer Division \\"Wiking,\\" the Germans began to draw on foreign volunteers from occupied countries.  Initially, only Nordic volunteers were accepted, but as the war progressed, and manpower shortages became more acute, the Germans began to broaden their definition of \\"acceptable races\\" to encompass just about every race except Africans and Jews.<br />The Head of the SS, Reichsfuhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, was, in fact, fascinated by the fighting capabilities of certain non-German peoples, and this included the \\"Islamic faith, which he believed fostered fearless soldiers\\".  He envisioned the creation of a Bosnian SS division constituted solely of Bosnian Muslims in a manner similar to the Bosnian divisions of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Hitler, however, does not appear to have been so enthusiastic about such an undertaking, and it took some time before he finally permitted the division to be created.<br />The approval came in February 1943.  By mid-April, approximately 8,000 men had volunteered for service with Handschar and three months later the number had only risen to 15,000.  As this was still far short of the number required for a full division, recruiting of ethnic Albanians was begun, and finally the incorporation of Croatians--approximately 3,000--was permitted.<br />Training continued until mid-February 1944.  Handschar was then returned to Bosnia where it was assigned the task of securing the northeastern region of Bosnia bordered by the Sava, Bosna, Spreca and Dvina Rivers.  Anti-partisan operations commenced almost immediately, and these were carried out successfully.  One of the largest was Maibaum, which was conducted in late-April against the Partisan III Bosnia Corp.  After several days of fighting, one German report claimed that close to 1,000 partisans had been killed.<br />As was always the case, however, the setbacks that the partisans faced was not permanent.  While successful, Maibaum did not fully rid the northeastern section of Bosnia from partisan activity in general, and by early June the partisans had regrouped and were on the offensive again.  Heavy fighting took place at Lopare on June 8, 1944 and units from Handschar positioned there were overrun.  In total,  the division sustained just over 200 dead and a further 600 injured--the most serious losses to date.<br />For the rest of the summer, Handschar conducted further anti-partisan operations and by the end of the summer it was worn down and the morale among the men beginning to decline.  During this time there were plans to form another Bosnian SS division (23rd Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS \\"Kama\\"), and officers and men were transferred from Handschar to facilitate this.<br />At about this same time, Handschar began to experience organizational and morale problems that were instigated by rumours that the unit would soon be leaving Bosnia.  During the autumn of 1944, therefore, Handschar was plagued by desertions, and so Himmler decided that it and the still-forming Kama would be reorganized into two \\"small\\" divisions of 10,000 men each.  However, on October 17, shortly after Handschar had been transferred to Zagreb (which resulted in more desertions), the men of Kama mutinied and shortly afterward it was disbanded.<br/>It was now becoming quite evident that to the Germans that their Bosnian volunteers were becoming unreliable and as a result many were disarmed.  To compensate for the loss of manpower, local Croatians were pressed into service, but this did little to enhance the fighting capabilities of Handschar, which, in mid-November, finally left Bosnia for Hungary, where it fought against the advancing Soviets.  <br />For the rest of the winter, Handschar occupied three defensive positions--Margarethestellung, Dorotheastellung, and the Reichsschutzstellung--and were successful at slowing the Soviet advance in mid-April.  It was all, of course, for no purpose as the war ended several weeks later.<br />Lepre relied almost entirely on primary sources in order to write Himmler's Bosnian Division and, as he explains in the preface, even these were scarce, and those that were available are \\"notoriously inaccurate\\".  One has to wonder what information is not available and the implications that this has for our understanding of the true conduct of Handschar in its prosecution of its anti-partisan operations.  But in terms of the book being a \\"chronicle of the birth, life, and ultimate death\\" of Handschar, the author has done an excellent job, and one hopes that it will lead to a better understanding of the paradoxical \\"volunteer\\" aspect of the Waffen-SS and the nature of the war in the Balkan Theater.	2004-01-06

The Choices of a Nation and the Ethics of Survival	Books	2	2	15	N	N	Not worth the time	To say that this book is a valuable work of historical scholarship on the Third Reich would be a fairly grandiose lie.  <br />Presumably Seduced by Hitler is supposed to deal with the unethical compromises that the Germans made which allowed for the rise of Hitler and his evil regime; and since Germans did so willingly, they were therefore complicit in all that the Hitler regime perpetrated.  <br />There is no denying the fact that many Germans, to one degree or another, made choices that unethical to survive; and there were certainly a large number who embraced the Nazi regime and its ideology--such people exist in every society, whether Monarchies, Stalinist or Democratic.  <br />However, one derives from this book, that it is yet another one of these works that presumes that the Germans, and what the Germans did, is different and unique.  But anyone with any knowledge of history knows that this is malarky.  The only thing different and unique about what the Nazis orchastrated was the manner in which it was carried out.  And that has certainly been covered by vast amount of legitimate scholarly literature.  <br />At some points the hack-journalistic nature of this book swerves into the absurd.  At one point, the authors claim that \\"even the ecological principles espoused by the present-day environmentalist parties were first put forth by the constructors of the autobahn.\\"  Oh really!?  Try telling that to any member of the German Green Party (Die Gruenen/Bundnis 90)!  In fact, the Greens were very conscious of the affinity that the \\"Blut und Boden\\" relicts of the Third Reich Era (called Browns) would have for them, and made every attempt to exclude them.  The Greens are a product of the post-1968 era in which the Nazi past of the previous generation was finally questioned and criticized.  To suggest that they were somehow hold-overs from the Nazi era is just plain stupid. <br />There is a wealth of scholarly work on the Third Reich available; my suggestion would be to refer to those works, and avoid books like Seduced by Hitler.	2003-12-31

In its barbarity, the Final Solution is unprecedented in this the history of Western civilization.  However, some 50 years after the war, the question still remains: what type of person could carry out this genocide?  Christopher R. Browning delves into this aspect of the Holocaust in Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland.<br />Like many other such battalions, Police Battalion 101 was organized for the purpose of policing and pacifying territories captured by the advancing German during the early years of the war in the east.  Their role in Hitler's quest for new Lebensraum for the German people was significant.  They were, however, a non-combat unit.  For this reason, the unit was mostly comprised of men in their forties and those unfit for combat duty.<br />Browning classifies the men of Police Battalion 101 as being ordinary: he points out that most were conscripted white-collar types from Hamburg and Luxembourg, who, unlike the SS and other German units, were not overtly indoctrinated with Nazi ideology.  But, as the reader eventually discovers, regardless of individual variances in belief, the involvement of the majority of Police Battalion 101 in the Final Solution is undeniable.  <br />By mid-1942, Police Battalion 101 was stationed in Lublin District in central Poland.  Over the course of the next 12 months they would participate in a series of massacres, deportations, and a lengthy \\"Jew hunt.\\"  The profound psychological transformation that the men of the unit underwent while undertaking these operations is startling.<br />Some men initially refused to participate in the first killings, with dissension being the norm and, later, an accepted fact even among the officers of the unit.  Yet in time most would become willing participants.<br />By November 1943, the once reluctant Police Battalion 101 would conduct, without hesitation or remorse, massacres at Majdanek and Pontiawa that, in total, took over 30,000 lives.<br />The majority of the details about the Battalion come from trials held in Germany in the 1960s.  Many accounts and testimonies by former unit members were recorded at the time, but Browning admits that their information is limited.  He reminds the reader that some 20 years after the fact the participants were in a situation where those testifying could downplay their role by intentionally being ambiguous or forgetful.  <br />\\"Quite simply,\\" states Browning in the preface to Ordinary Men, \\"some men deliberately lied, for they feared the judicial consequences of telling the truth as they remembered it.  Not only repression and distortion but conscious mendacity shaped the accounts of the witnesses.\\"<br />Taking this into consideration, Browning's ability to fashion a clear, accurate and consistent account of the horrific conduct of Police Battalion 101 is excellent.  Deciphering the ambiguities and willful contradictions made by the testifiers, the author successfully presents the story critically and objectively.  The end result is a work that is essential to understanding the perplexing conduct of those supposedly \\"ordinary men\\" who participated in the Final Solution.	2003-12-26

It was during this time that westward expansion was taking on greater significance and it was realized that because of the arid climate in the southwest in particular, that current means of transportation were a hinderance.<br />So under Davis' direction, several expeditions were undertaken to the Mediterranen region to procure the animals.  These were then transported to Texas where observed and allowed to adjust, before finally being used on several expeditions.  <br />By all accounts, it appears that the camels did fare well, although several negative aspects of the animal behavior came to light (they being carefully avoided in the writings of those Camel Corps proponents).  <br />These negative qualities, however, did not out weigh the camel's benefits, and on a number of occasions proved that they were far superior to the horse and mule.<br />But there were a number of factors that nevertheless contributed to the Camel Corps' failure--most notably the &quot;horse-minded[ness]&quot; of many of those assigned to work with the camels.  Many of the common soldiers simply grew to hate these animals.  <br />Moreover, just as the Camel Corps was becoming established, the Civil War took center stage, and by the time it had ended, the government had simply lost interest in the whole expirement.  This, however, did not end story of the camels in America altogether, as many were eventually set free or purchased by private citizens.<br />Needless to say, this is a very interesting story, one that Faulk has well researched and related in a very readable manner.	2003-12-26

Almost a decade later, however, the freedom and hope that the end of Communism in Europe had proven itself to be a shallow Western ideal that has little relevance to Eastern Europe. Slavenka Drakulic, a Croatian-born novelist and journalist, discusses the tribulations of a &quot;freed&quot; Eastern Europe, and the legacy that its sordid past has left for the new Europe to deal with. <br />The post-Communist Europe has shaped up to be nothing close to what many people, especially the Eastern Europeans, expected it to be. The allure of the West, with its wealth and Capitalist spirit, were stark contrasts for most to what their reality was. Under the rule of Communism, Eastern Europeans lived day-to-day with shortages and lower quality technology. <br />For Drakulic, her situation was a little better than the rest. Tito, the former ruler of Yugoslavia, had shirked Communism for his own style of dictatorship, one that allowed for contact with the West. But, as Drakulic explains, Yugoslavia and the West were still worlds apart. <br />When the Iron Curtain fell, the Eastern Europeans began to integrate the Western way of life into their own. But this transition was not easy or desired; the end of Communist rule did not mean the end of Communist thinking, not did it change the general worldview of many who did not easily renounce their Communist past. Mixed with the re-emergence of decades old animosities, Eastern Europe began to diverge from the path it was expected to take. Within a few years, it became evident that prosperity was not to be had for all. And now, with a decade having past, the truth remains: the East and West are still worlds apart. <br />This is a dichotomy that has troubled Europe and, more recently, the entire Western world. As has been evident in the continued tension over NATO's expansion, the perspectives of these two halves of Europe aresignificantly different and essentially incompatible. Throughout her essays, Drakulic makes this evident, discussing in detail the culture-shock she experienced those first few years. Now having lived and worked in Western Europe, she sees the fundamental differences between the two Europes and reflects on the causes and effects of this dichotomy. In the process, she reveals and explains the situation currently facing Europe. <br />One of the most noticeable aspects of the post-Communist era is the re-emergence of old hatreds and rivalries. And this is no more evident than in the Balkans, where a number of brutal ethnic conflicts have taken place. On occasion, Drakulic delves into the absurdity and pointlessness of these wars, but never fails to mention the circumstances that surrounded them, and the roots they had in recent history--an aspect which is sometimes overlooked in the West. <br />With such circumstances, another theme becomes evident. In the Balkans and most other parts of Europe, identity is a significant aspect of everyday life. In the essay &quot;People from the Three Borders,&quot; Drakulic talks about a neighbour of hers in Isteria who at any given moment with claim to either be a Croat or an Italian. And there is another friend who holds three passports so as to get around more easily in the national patchwork of the Balkans. &quot;'It is a matter of survival,' he says, 'one never knows what will happen here.'&quot; <br />Another important aspect of Eastern Europe which Drakulic discusses from time to time is the haunting effect that Communism has on the present day. In &quot;A Nostalgic Party at the Graveyard,&quot; she recounts a time in Rumania when she came across a gathering of about 150 people conducting a surreal ceremony at the grave of Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's former Communist dictator. A more personal account is discussed in &quot;My Father's Guilt,&quot; in which she discusses her own father's role in the Communist hierarchy. Both essays are powerful and insightful, and reveal much about the current situation in Eastern Europe. <br />There is, of course, much more to Cafe Europa than this, and on the whole the book maintains a high degree of interest and insight. Drakulic's writing style is light, descriptive and concise. She has an astounding ability to make her stories down-to-earth and easy to grasp while not compromising the seriousness of some of the topics. Cafe Europa is a work of great significance and very much worth reading.	2003-12-26

Although set in the post-war years, the seeting was in southwestern Germany, in the general area where I had been, and so the book brought back many pleasant memories of the beautiful Badisch countryside.  But the story is really not a light romantic portrayal of country life.  Life on the land had always been a struggle, and the added burden of a post-war economy was making things even more difficult.  It was also a time of great social change, in particular for women; and that's what the story is about.  We follow the protagonist as she grows from a young girl into a women and attempts to chart her own course in a strongly patriarchal society.  But the greatest difficulties she faces are those at home, as her parent, so deeply rooted in the rural lifestyle, do not fully understand the changing nature of German society, and their daughter's need to adapt to this in order to make her own way.	2003-12-24

But I've thought about it for a while now and I've come to the conclusion that I just can't agree with what Chris did, and am not so certain that Krakauer was justified in portraying Chris in such a sympathetic manner.  He does seem to have been a bright and unique individual, and his disdain and attempt to disaccoiate himself with our corrupt, flawed society has to be commended.  But the fact of the matter is, that in attempting to buck convention, Chris went about it in a very Western manner: selfish, individualistic, disrespectful.  I could go on about this for a long, long time; but I'll only touch on the last aspect.  In the book, Krakauer states that he received numerous letters following the publication of his article in OUTSIDE.  One was to the effect that Chris had no respect for Nature; Krakauer contends that he did, and tries to defend Chris on this point.  I have have to disagree with Krakauer completely.  Chris' actions denoted a profound disrespect for Nature, an attitude that unfortunately has been an habitual flaw in weltanschauung of our \\"civilization.\\"  His death therefore is nothing more than a tragic waste.	2003-12-22

The citizens of the city, the British believed, would welcome them only.  Instead, the British encountered dogged resistence orchastrated by one Andrew Jackson, who only had a motley assortment of military and militia units at his command.  On December 28, 1814 and again on January 8, 1815, the two sides clashed, and eventually the British were repulsed, sustaining disproportionately high casualties.  Tragically, however, the treaty ending the war had be signed on Christmas eve--thus the battle was little more than a useless waste of life.  All and all, this was an entertaining read, but I was somewhat bemused by the fact that the author found it necessary to emphasize the fact that such a rag-tag assortment of men had defeated the &quot;best trained army&quot; in the world.  Considering the repeated defeats that the Americans had experienced prior to this, and the fact that the British were much more preoccupied with Napoleon, etc., the victory at New Orleans really seems to be a hollow victory at best.	2003-12-22

It turned out that the remains were those of soldiers from the War of 1812, more specifically from 1814 when the Americans and undertaken another invasion of Upper Canada, and had established an extended fortified zone running from Fort Erie down to Snake Hill.    This book is esentially deals with the events surround the archeological dig--conducted by Ron Williamson of ASI--and a historical overview of the events of 1814.  Death at Snake Hill is meant for a general readership; the scientific report of the dig was published as:  Snake Hill: An Investigation of a Military Cemetery from the War of 1812, which was published by Dundurn in 1991.	2003-12-18

This book was certainly entertaining and contained a number of stories that I plan on delving into further, but the book is really a mixed bag.  Some of the stories are too vague to really warrant inclusion in the book.  References are also a problem: there is a bibliography, but half of the short list are not ghost related; and those few references to contemporary newspaper reports are, sad to say, questionable.  The one that I was able to check on was in relation to the &quot;Baldoon Mystery,&quot; which the author devotes a number of pages to.  She claims that there was an article in the Spetember 26, 1894 Toronto Globe in which the girl Lettie McDowell relates an encounter... but I couldn't find it.  So either the date is wrong, or the reference is bogus.	2003-12-17

Scandal	The Burgermeister's Daughter is a fascinating and highly readable study of a ... scandal that errupted in the German city of Schwabish Hall during the early years of the Reformation.  The central figure, Anne Buschler, the daughter of a former Burgermeister and long-time city councilman, was a girl who liked to test the limits and would often have tongues wagging over her--for that day and age, at least--wild behaviour.  It came to the point where she was having intimate relations with two guys, Erasmus of Limpurg and Daniel Treutwein.  When this was discovered by her father, he disinherited her; but instead of allowing herself to be cast adrift in this manner, she fought back and thus ensued a protracted legal battle against her father, and, after his death, her siblings.  In the end, we are presented with an extra-ordinary glimpse into the lives of (upper class) Germans during this era, German culture and society, the status of women, and the intricacies of the German legal system.  It's a rare treat to find a book that is so meticulously researched but so readable.  Highly recommended.	2003-12-17

Essentially, the purpose of this book is to instruct women how to shirk the traditional institution of marriage and live a \\"self-reliant and independent\\" life as a single.  That's all well and good; but there's more to this book than just that.  Whether this is simply to appeal to the tastes of the reader, or whether a reflection of the writer's own attitudes is not quite clear, but the underlying theme of this book is misandry.  That's right, the hatred of men.  Here are some quotes to clarify what I mean:<br />\\"What exactly do men contribute to marriage?  Sex, and companionship are readilly available and socially acceptable without the bonds of matrimony...  Years ago he brought home the bacon and she cooked it, but today she does both equally well.\\" (p.3)<br />\\"What happened to men between thirty and forty-four who should have been husbands and fathers?  They are still little boys playing aimlessly with their electronic toys and living in a state of perpetual adolescence, afraid to grow up and take on the responsibilites their fathers assumed unquestioningly.\\"(p.8)<br />\\"Hot flash!  The whole fuss about the inability of today's men to grow up is laughable to women who have always known that fact.\\" (p.8)<br />And under the sub-heading \\"The Bachelor as a Jerk\\":<br />\\"The dictionary defines the word jerk as \\"dull, fatuous, stupid, numbskull,\\" which must be viewed as an acceptable description of men who spend their lives avoiding commitment...\\" (p.9)<br />And so on, and so forth...<br />Now while the author feels herself justified in portraying single men in such a negative light, she then devotes the rest of the book to explaining why women are justified in pursuing the single-life.  They do so, she claims, for a multitude of reasons: because men are boorish, refuse to communicate with and understand their devoted partners, are abusive, have daughters (harridans, is whatMs. Smith refers to them as) from previous marriages whill question her every purchase; or that it allows the single woman to lead a productive life in the workforce, spend evenings alone chugging back red wine and downing a TV dinner, pursue self-fulfilling interests, etc.  <br />Needless to say, this book is filled with hypocracies, contradictions, paradoxes--you name it.  The writing, moreover, is quite low-brow.<br />Now, I'd like to dismiss this as simply being a stupid book--and seeing that there are so many cheap copies of the book available, my guess is that many other people felt this way as well--but unfortunately, from all taht I've seen and heard over the course of my short life, I do think that it has relevance.  It does seem to reflect the way women think.  The book, therefore, would be a good one for men to read who want to understand why relationships with women have become so unpredictable and tumultuous.	2003-12-11

Although the sources are not considerable, leaving Ozment to fill in the gaps with astute, yet conjectural interpretation, the reader still gets an excellent sense of what it must have been like to live during this era, and realizes that, yes, in some respects things haven't changed all that much.  It's my understanding that Ozment's interpretation of family life during this period--that it is not as overtly authoritarian and patriarchal as we have been led to believe--is somewhat \\"controversial\\".  In my opinion, our understanding of Germans and German history is unjustifiably tainted by the brief Hitler era, pre-Hitler anti-Germanic attitudes and current social ideologies, and that Ozment's work appears to be rectifying this problem to a certain degree.  One hopes that much more of this sort of work is in the offing.	2003-12-01

The Dawn of Canadian History is intended to set the stage for the series, and discusses in a general sense the primordial beginnings of Canada, theories on how the continent was populated by native peoples, the possible accidental visits by the Vikings, and early explorations by the Europeans.  Keep in mind that the book was first published in 1914 and therefore contains much dated information.  Leacock's opinions also at times reflect those of his contemporaries and are clearly now not acceptable.

One thing that the author touches upon is the relevance of time; things take time to happen, sometimes a painfully long time, and this is often difficult for humans to understand.  Nature has progressed at its own pace from the beginning; at times its course has been checked, but in the end Nature has rebounded and rebalanced itself.  For much of this process, humans have been a part of it; possessing only &quot;primitive&quot; technologies they were obligated to rely on Nature; but over the course of the last few millennia, the human race has manage to evolve to a point where we can dominate and control Nature to our own benefit.  This of course has had an adverse effect on Nature, and during the 20th century we began to experience the consequences of this state of things.  But in many cases, the change has been subtle, and as a result there has been a bitter debate raging as to whether the concerns of the envirnmentalists are in fact legitimate.  Naysayers will argue that things really haven't changed all that much, that when one looks at the evidence that is presented, it doesn't look like much is happening at all.  They do so because they have the inherent human trait of seeing things from their own perspective, and fail to see how we are subtly having a negative impact on the environment; the end, or whatever you want to call it, may not come in the year so-and-so in our lifetime, but it will invariably come if we continue on as we are.	2003-06-28

Although a media sensation, the story soon faded to obscurity; only to be resurrected by Dick North, a small-town newspaper editor, in his book The Mad Trapper of Rat River, and the dubious Thomas P. Kelley in his The Rat River Trapper.  Both published in 1972.  Soon afterwards, Saskatoon-based Granicus Films began work on a movie based on the story, enlisting Rudy Wiebe as screenwriter.  When the financial backing for the movie fell through, Wiebe reworked the screenplay into a novel.  Although I have yet to read much of Wiebe's work, what I have read has impressed me much, so I was looking forward to reading his take on the Mad Trapper.  It was not far into the book that my interest began to wane; it is not particularly well written, but what disappointed me more was fairly significant manner in which the plot was reworked for dramatic effect.  The most obvious of these changes is the role that Constable Millen plays.  Also the characterization of \\"Wop\\" May, whose role in tracking of the MAd Trapper was instrumental in its success, was somewhat questionable.  Not surprisingly, this novel is not considered among Wiebe's best.	2003-06-21

Kolodzi therefore is torn between his duty and the temptation to desert and return home and shack up with his girl who he hasn't seen for ages, and who incidently has connections with the partisans, etc.  Anyway, it is a gripping, face-paced book, and not all that bad, even if the title is a little, well, odd.	2003-06-12

Usually flying in dense swarms, a score or more birds could be brought down by a single shotgun blast.  In some cases so many were killed, that the hunters left those that could not be transported to market in massive piles.  And so it came to pass that by the late 19th-century, the Eskimo Curlew population declined rapidly, to the point where it was virtually extinct at the time Bodsworth wrote the book.<br />Although a work of fiction, this is a book that should be read by everyone who has an interest in Nature and the environment.	2003-06-11

Just finished reading the Mad Trapper of Rat River by Dick North--the story of the epic manhunt for Albert Johnson across the Canadian arctic during the winter of 1932--and thought that I'd have a go at the copy of Thomas P. Kelley's Rat River Trapper.  Having previously read part of a work by Kelley, I knew that I wasn't in for a factual reconstruction of the story, but thought I'd read it nonetheless.  Well, not ten pages in, I'd just about had enough.  More of the same old malarky: distorted facts, questionable eye-witness accounts, and outright fabrications.  No, I just can't recommend this book--there's simply no point in reading it.	2003-06-09

It was a bitterly cold December 26, 1931 when four members of the RCMP approached the small cabin of a mysterious trapper named Albert Johnson. There sole intent was to question Johnson about a complaint made by a neighbouring trapper concerning traps that had been tampered with. But without a word, the trapper fired upon the constables, injuring one. Shortly thereafter, Johnson had disappeared into the bush, thus instigating an epic manhunt that would last close to fifty days, and span some 150 miles.<br />Forty years later, author Dick North set out to document the story, and, more importantly, try and cast light on the identity of the mysterious Albert Johnson. Relying heavily on eye-witness accounts, North pieces together an interesting, sometimes rivetting story. But admittedly, there are limitations, and in the end, much is left to conjecture.<br />North concludes that Albert Johnson was more than likely a man who also went by the name of Arthur Nelson, and who for seven years prior to his death supposedly trapped and prospected in northern Saskatchewan and British Columbia. Alway quiet and \\"non-commital\\" this Arthur Nelson came and went mysteriously, and exhibited traits quite similar to that of the Mad Trapper. <br />Although disdained by some--especially women, around whom he evidently was extremely shy--many were understanding of his peculiar loner idiocincricies. But, provided that this Arthur Nelson is in fact Albert Johnson--which appears to be fairly likely--he apparently grew increasingly paranoid and suspicious of people. All of which led people to believe that he was hiding something. And as is always the case, there is much speculation as to what it was.<br />The author addresses this at the end of the book, but given that there is little evidence to work with, it's left to the reader to decide: was he a murderer, illegal immigrant, or simply a misanthrope caught up in events beyond his control? <br />All and all, a very interesting book and thrilling read, but in order to get the fully story--supposedly--of who the Mad Trapper was, one has to read Trackdown, which was published in 1989.<br />Trackdown is the result of twenty-odd years of North's obsessive research into the identity of the Mad Trapper.  In the first part of the book, North addresses several theories of who the Mad Trapper could have been, but in each case he manages to uncover evidence that dismiss these individuals.  <br />The turning point in his hunt comes when he was contacted by the North Dakota State Historical Society.  As it turns out, there is a small article in a county history stating that the Mad Trapper may have in fact been a man by the name of Johnny Johnson.<br />Born Johan Konrad Jonsen in Norway in 1898, Johnson had emigrated to the USA with his parent at the age of six.  Life in Dakota was a constant struggle and brought the family little gain, so at a young age Johnson reverted to crime.  This resulted in several prison sentences before finally in 1923 he disappeared, presumably heading north into Canada.  <br />Initially, I was very skeptical about this theory; to me, there was little resemblence between the three mug shots of Johnny Johnson, the 1930 Ross River photo showing Arthur Nelson and the pictures of the dead Mad Trapper.  But as I read on, North did put together a compelling argument, and the more I read and the more I studied the pictures, the more plausable it all became.  Interestingly, the Johnson family had in fact been in contact with the RCMP several years after the incident; Johnson's mother, having seen the picture of the Mad Trapper, was certain that he was her son.  But the RCMP dismissed this claim, as it did all other such claims, leaving the mystery unsolved.<br />While North's argument seems plausable, I was still left with a nagging sense of doubt.  While his evidence is compelling, it is far from conclusive and could quite easily be picked apart by someone with the time and resources to do so.One way to solve the matter would of course be to exhume the Mad Trapper and take DNA samples and conduct other forensic tests.  North, believing that the body would still be in reasonably good shape, attempted to do this; but these efforts were stymied by the locals.<br />So although North presents a compelling argument for Johnny Johnson being the Mad Trapper, the case is not closed.  The myth lives on.	2003-06-09

The drops, however, were poorly done and much chaos ensued as the men tried to form up and carry out their missions.  As the book Currahee! graphically describes, the bitter fighting that ensued was fluid and brutal.  Often in small bands (sometimes consisting of men from both the 101st and 82nd) the paratroopers took on whatever Germans they encountered, causing much disruption behind the lines and no doubt lessening the influence of the reserve units that the Germans sent to drive the Allies off of the beaches.<br />This book is a gripping eye-witness account to the D-Day invasion and the role that the 101st Airborne played in it.

When her mother Nedercook broke her hip at the remarkable age of 109, Edna Wilder took the opportunity to record stories and memories from her childhood.  Years later, Wilder developed her notes into book format after attending a simple magazine article writing course at the University of Alaska.      The book documents what life was like when Nedercook was about ten years old and living the traditional Eskimo lifestyle that her people lived prior to direct contact with Europeans.   Her people, who lived at Stoney Point near Nome, Alaska, led a difficult life, and survival depended on the availability of a number of species of animals, not to mention the weather, which at times would disrupt the general cycle of animal availability.  Such a strong dependence on these two factors is a major element of Nedercook's recollections, but has harsh as life was, it was by no means miserable.  There were many things for the young Nedercook to do, and when she was not assisting her mother with chores or accompanying her father when he went out to fish, she play or more importantly--as it was her duty to perpetuate the history and legends of her people--listening to her father or mother tell stories--stories which would have been long forgotten had it not been for this book.

This book is apparently a revised edition of Canada North which was published nine years earlier in 1967. I have yet to read Canada North, but from what I can gather is that Mowat set out to inform southern Canadians about a vast region of Canada which they had heretofore been ignoring: the vast, supposedly barren tiaga, tundra and arctic lands of the North. Up until this time, Canada was only asserting nominal control, and has essentially allowed missionaries, trappers and the HBC to impose themselves on the native peple of this region. Nine years later, things had changed significantly, and recognizing the new threat to the North, Mowat evidently reworked his original text in order to address these main concerns. Essentially what had happened was that the government of Canada found new reason to take an interest in the North because it was proving to be abundant in natural resources. This new-found interest in the North was clealry going to have detrimental consequences on both the people and environment of this region. In typical fashion, Mowat goes on the attack, lambasting the government and the multinational corporations fixing to exploit the North. Drawing on historical events both far in the distant past and only a few years old, Mowat shows how white interference and exploitation of the North and its people has had and will clealry have lasting consequences, consequences that will bring about the end of already serious disrupted traditional lifestyles of the various native peoples inhabiting this region. Mowat, an avid naturalist, also takes time to debunk the commonly held notion that the North is virtually devoid of flora and fauna. All in all, a very fascinating book by a man who has done much to expose the disgusting manner in which Canada has governed the North.	2002-08-27

Male's 100 Heirloom Tomatoes for the American Garden  is a welcomed and important work. <br />The author, a professor of microbiology, is one of the most knowledgeable enthusiast of the heirloom tomato, and has apparently herself grown c. 1200 varieties.  It is her passion of the heirloom, along with her extensive experience and her committed effort to researching the origins of numerous heirloom varieties, that led her to compile this book of one hundred varieties that she feels are the best that both the experienced and neophyte heirloom tomato grower will enjoy growing.<br />Central to the book is, of course, the section dealing with the individual varieties, but one should not over look the beginning of the book where the author deals with matters such as the history of the tomato, saving seeds and creating your own heirlooms in a clear and understandable manner.  <br />Most people who get their hands on this book will, no doubt, do what I did and start with the \\"field guide\\".  <br />The heirloom varieties are arranged in alphabetical order, and for each there are two pages, one with a brief description, and the other with a beautiful colour photograph.<br />Each description is fairly short, perhaps three or four short paragraphs and is followed by information sorted by following categories: type, origin, maturity, colour/shape, size/arrangement, yield, plant/foliage, taste, seeds (availability).  Each photo is that of an entire stem that has been removed so that one can see how the fruit is clustered, as well as the type of foliage; in some cases one of the tomatoes has been sliced so that one cane see what the insides of the given variety looks like.  <br />Since I have yet to grow a significant number of heirlooms, it is difficult for me to comment on the Male's choice of varieties.  I do wish, however, that I would have made more of an effort to get my hands on this book before I ordered my seeds (which I did in a manner that I believe most people do, by basing my opinion on the little blurb that the seedhouse includes with the variety, no to mention the name (I also chose by stated place of origin (Germany and Russia).)   One variety that I would definitely chosen was Black From Tula, a dark reddish/black with green shoulders midseason variety from the Ukraine.  Others of note are Hungarian Oval, Marizol Gold, and Orange Strawberry.  <br />That one heirloom variety that I have grown--having purchased the seeds unaware that it was an heirloom--is called Matina.  Although this variety bears uniform 4 to 6 oz. red fruits, and is quite prolific, I did not find it to be the most enjoyable of tomatoes.  I therefore was a little surprised to find it among the one hundred chosen for this volume.  (It must be noted that several varieties that the author claim to be \\"highly recommended\\", such as Jeff Davis, Fritz and Old Virginia could not be included in the because they were \\"not available for photographing\\".)<br />I have no hesitation in saying that 100 Heirloom Tomatoes for the American Garden is an excellent resource for anyone wishing to get into heirloom tomatoes, or even those who simply have a passion for vegetable gardening.	2002-08-24

Since first contact with the Inuit of this region was made by European, the latter have attempted to assert authority over them, first as missionaries and furtraders, later as government officials.  The result has been truly detrimental to the Inuit, so much so that it is extremely difficult for them to live their traditional way of life.  Also important is the psychological effect that White dominance has had, an issue that is still far from being resolved.  In turn, Brody also discusses the mentality of the Whites who came to the Eastern Arctic.  While they were enchanted by the seemingly romantic manner in which the Inuit lived, they also regarded these people with a profound distaste because of their skin colour and religious practices.  Although a couple decades old now, The people's Land is still a very insightful work, well worth reading by anyone interested in the Arctic.	2002-08-24

One evening, after returning from a production of Mozart's \\"Cosi fan tutte\\", they find that their flat has been burgled, leaving it devoid of every single item that the Ransomes have accumulated in their life together, much of which had been of little use at all anyway.<br />Faced with what would seem to be a devastating situation, the Ransomes in fact adapt to the situation as though it had been a blessing, and begin to rebuild their lives anew.  <br />It was at this point that I began to suspect that the main underling motive of the work was to serve as a critique of our modern materialistic culture, but then Bennett added an interesting twist.  Based on a query from a storage company, the Ransomes undertake an impromptu expedition to a storage facility, where, to their surprise--but indignation, rage, or even dismay--they find their stolen property.  Oddly, not only did they find all of their possessions, these possessions were arranged exactly as they had been in their flat; moreover, somebody by the name of Martin had made himself quite at home, apparently ignorant to the fact that everything about him was stolen.  In fact, he--and his lover--made himself more than just at home, which after the Ransomes have their possessions restored to them, is key to how the story plays itself out.<br />I have to say that the story proceeds along from this point in an interesting manner, although the ending in my opinion is somewhat indicative of the author's uncertainty as to how this off-beat tale should be resolved.  This is of little consequence really, when one comes to think of it--the story, although possessing a certain degree social commentary, can easily be read superficially as a means of passing a few spare hours.  Be forewarned: the format of this book is small, being smaller that the standard pocketbook and its stated length of 161 pp. is deceptive; the average word-per-page is much less than what one expects.  For this reason, The Clothes They Stood Up In should really be considered a novella.  <br />Although not an overly impressive book,  The Clothes They Stood Up In will provide the reader with a few hours of casual entertainment while not being excessive mind-numbing and/or pathetic.	2002-08-24

The British and Americans had been under pressure from Stalin for some time to open a &quot;second front&quot; in Europe.  But the Americans and British were divided on where this should be done; the Americans wanted an invasion of France while the British wanted it to be in Africa, where they were currently engaged in a brutal struggle with Rommel's Afrika Korp.  The failed &quot;raid&quot; on Dieppe proved that a landing in France was not the best idea, so planning for the three-pronged invasion of North Africa began.  A sticky issue was, however, the reaction of the French defenders; would there be resistance or not?  The French were certainly no friends of the Germans, but an invasion on there territory was just that, and would likely be resisted no matter who the invader was.  Although efforts were made to stop the French from resisting, the invasion did not go uncontested, and the Aliies (primarily the Americans because it was largely an American operation) did sustain hundreds of casualties.  The invasion made possible the destruction of the Afrika Korp and a re-establishment of Allied control over the Mediteranean Sea, thus making possible the invasion of Italy the following year.	2002-08-24

It deals with the Cree living in northern Quebec near James Bay and how in the late 1960s and early 1970s there traditional livestyle, already negatively affected by the workings of the Canadian government, was under attack again.  This time it was the government of Quebec led by Robert Bourassa; they had this grand idea that they would turn northern Quebec, which they viewed to be barren and useless land, into one major power generating station.  This meant daming rivers and flooding huge tracts of land, land which happened to be the traditional hunting ground for several thoudand Crees, who, despite facing years of injustice and discrimination, continued to subsist to a large degree off of the land.  Prior to this period, the Quebec government would likely have been able to proceed unhindered, but by the late 1960s the Native people of Canada were beginning to assert their rights, and Bourassa soon found himself facing very strong opposition.  The issue went to court and after a long legal battle, the courts ruled in favour of the Cree.  It was a victory that was, however, very short-lived, as within days the ruling was overturned.  The Cree intended to continue the fight, but it soon became evident that nothing would become of it; it would take years before the matter would be resolved, and by that time the James Bay project would be complete.  So the Cree reached a settlement with the Quebec government.<br />Although the book's central focus is the struggle between the Cree and the Quebec government over the James Bay project, the book also provides the reader with a very intimate and compelling portrate of the Cree people and their lifestyle which was then dying out.   It should be noted too that the author was also responsible for several documentary films about the Cree: \\"Job's Garden\\" and \\"Cree Hunters of Mistassini\\" both of which provide an excellent visual account of the Cree people and the \\"barren\\" land that they inhabited and were fighting to save.<br />This book was reprinted in 1991 with an additional chapter updating events since the book was initially published in 1975.	2002-08-24

In order to provide you with a better sense of the contents of the Turtle Talk without going into a lengthy analysis, I will simply list the people interviewed and the title that the Plants bequeathed the respective interviews:<br />Gary Snyder: &quot;Regenerate Culture!&quot;<BR>Peter Berg: &quot;Bioregional and Wild! A New Cultural Image...&quot;<BR>Starhawk: &quot;Bending the Energy: Spirituality, Politics and Culture&quot;<BR>George Woodcock: &quot;Mutual Aid: The Seed of the Alternative&quot;<BR>Susan Griffin: &quot;Celebrating All of Life&quot;<BR>Dave Foreman: &quot;Becoming the Forest In Defence of Itself&quot;<BR>John Seed: &quot;Deep Ecology Down Under&quot;<BR>Marie Wilson: &quot;Wings of the Eagle&quot;<BR>George Watts: &quot;Working Together: Natives, Non-Natives and the Future&quot;<BR>Caroline Estes: &quot;Consensus and Community&quot;<BR>Freeman House: &quot;Salmon and Settler: Toward a Culture of Reinhabitation&quot;<BR>Susan Meeker-Lowry: &quot;Breaking free: Building Bioregional Economies&quot;<BR>Murray Bookchin: &quot;Cities, Councils and Confederations&quot;<br />It is interesting to read these interviews well over a decade after the book wasfirst published.  They present a vision and hope for the future that in all honesty our society has failed to work toward.  I'm not at all looking forward to the consequences.  Many environmentalists believed that the 1990s would be the defining period for the future of our planet, but it is clear that the momentum of the environmental movement in general has waned due in large part to political intransigence and, yes, a concerted effort by the business and corporate elites to discredit environmentalists and downplay environmental concerns.  So we are no doubt worse off than we were when Turtle Talk was published, but it is not too late; therefore, the book's relevance is far from negligible.  Those who are concerned with the state of our planet's environment, are not interested in just &quot;saving what's left,&quot; and want some timeless inspiration, will no doubt find this a worthy addition to their library.	2002-08-24

The events of 1917, these Communist scholars concluded, were nothing but revolutionary activity.<br />Western scholarship's acceptance of this conclusion stems, Pipes explains, from a lack of source material, much of which was deemed classified by the Soviet regime.<br />But access to this information is now open, and Pipes, among others, has utilized this opportunity in an attempt to re-evaluate the Revolutions, with the product being two extensive works (on which these essays are based).  Not surprisingly, his understanding of the events of 1917 has changed somewhat, and thus the three essays in the book are a continued attempt to debunk much of the &quot;revisionist&quot; perspective with less radical conclusions.<br />Among the notions that Pipes challenges is the very insistence by the &quot;revisionists&quot; that the Revolutions were in fact revolutions.<br />As the author clearly outlines, the events of 1917 were actually the work of a small group of intellectuals headed by the idealist Lenin.  His overthrow of the Czarist regime is argued by Pipes as being a coup d'etat which involved the people as a whole in only a small degree.<br />This brings Pipes to his second major argument.  Were the people ready, willing, or even a part of the coup d'etat process?  It has often been a marvel to historians that the agrarian based nation of Russia was the one nation to take heed of Marx's dialectical writings.  But, as Pipes explains, the people (that is, peasantry) indeed had little reason or precedent to desire a change in the ruling regime, and the radical writings of Lenin and his cohorts had little impact on them, since it offered little in the way of a betterment of lifestyle.<br />Lastly Pipes addresses the post-coup d'etat events surrounding the ascension of Stalin as the next leader of the Soviet Regime.  Several years after the events of 1917, Lenin's failing health allowed Stalin to enter the scene, a man who Lenin recognized as having an unstable personality, one unviable for effectively continuing the Communist programmes as Lenin had planned.<br /><br />This opposition to Stalin was glossed over by Communist scholars to maintain a healthy image of the leadership, and thus was subsequently adopted by Western scholars.<br />It is easily said, then, that there is much of value in Three Whys of the Russian Revolution to history students and others interested in the events of 1917.  Pipes' three essays present sound, articulate, and compelling arguments as to the causes and course of the Revolutions, and is thus an important asset for future scholarship on the subject.n of Russia was the one nation to take heed of Marx's dialectical writings.

The book is divided into three parts.  The first deals with the nature of the global ecological crisis.   In the second part, the author focuses on three schools of thought in the environmental movement: Deep Ecology, Spiritual Ecology, and Social Ecology.  Lastly is discussed the movements that have grown out of these schools of thought, namely, Green politics, Ecofeminism and Sustainable Development.  <br />While Radical Ecology is not lacking in information and insight, it really is little more than an overview and therefore does not discuss in depth any of the issues covered.  It is therefore a work best suited for those who simply want an introduction to environmentalism.	2002-08-24

The book covers the first three decades of the movement, which essentially began when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962.  Environmentalism really established itself quickly after the publication of this book; the threats that Carson discussed struck a nerve with the American people.  This growing concern led to the establishment of a number of organizations like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, as well as forcing politicians to start paying attention to environmental issues.  But as Sale points out, the environmental movement has experienced numerous setbacks.  First off, the political establishment has persisted in its resistance to legislating truly effective environmental policies.  Second, there has been a considerable backlash from big business.  Thirdly, many of the idealistic organizations of the 1960s and 1970s have essentially sold out in their effort to play hardball with the big boys, thus diluting the revolutionary aspect of environmentalism and, hence, giving rise to \\"radical\\" environmentalists.  All in all, this is a good book, very well and clearly written and bountiful in relevant information for those wanting a better understanding of the environmental movement in the United States.	2002-08-24

Orginally, it had been the Italians who were taking on the British here, but after be severely whipped a number of times, the weak, poorly lead and equipped Italians looked as though they were on the verge of collapsing, thus exposing the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of Europe to the British.  The ensuing contest between the British and Germans saw the two forces driving one another back and forth across the North African coast until finally, due to several circumstances basically out of Romml's control, the Afrika Korps could no longer put up a fightand hence surrendered early in 1943.  <br />This book is not a particularly impressive work on this theater of the war, although it really isn't meant to be I guess.  It is really just an overview, and for anyone who just wants to get a sense of the timeline of the the events in North Africa, it is a good book.  One drawback is, however, that the book has no illustrations and therefore someone unfamiliar with the region (such as myself) will have some difficulty the movements of the forces and the location of many of the battles.	2002-08-17

James much revered stories.  These stories were all first written for publication in magazines or for his famous Christmas readings, and were subsequently collected into four seperate volumes: Ghoast Stories of an Antiquary (1904), More Ghost Stories (1911), A Thin Ghost and Others (1919), and A Warning to the Curious (1925).  Three stories that were published in magazines following the first publication of this work, and do not appear in this reprint; they are: The Experiment, The Malice of Inanimate Objects, and A Vignette.<br />James' skill for conceiving and presenting ghost stories seems to have developed at relatively young age, and his reading of some of his stories at King's College at Christmastime was a quite popular event.  But ghost stories were, unfortunately, not James' priority; he was an antiquarian, and much respected one at that.  He was also a noted linguist, paleographer, medievalist and biblical scholar--fields that all influenced his stories.<br />While it is safe to say that these ghost stories are among the best ever written, their style and subject matter are still a matter of taste.  So it is difficult to catagorically recommend this book, but I doubt that any lover of ghost stories will be able to put this book down without difficulty after sampling but a story or two.	2002-08-06

The Germans were on the offensive, driving the Russians further and further back, and Stalin needed assistance (or so the secretive Soviet dictator claimed), and wanted it fast.  His allies--the same allies who appeared to be dragging their feet on the \\"Second Front\\" issue--agreed to supply him with what he needed, and decided that the best way to do so was by convoys via the Arctic to Russia's northern ports.  After a difficult start--the biggest setback being convoy PQ 17--and initially hampered by the Battle of the Atlantic, the allies managed to devise a convoy system that eventually succeeded in supplying the Soviets with millions of tons of foodstuffs, ammunition, equipment and medical supplies.  In turn, the Germans never managed to get things together and lost some of their best ships: the Tirpitz and the Scharnhorst.  Although considered a success, Stalin--despite his own secrecy and lack of cooperation--viewed his allies' handling of the convoys as more proof that they were secretly against him.  Therefore, despite the heroic effort of thousands of merchant (of whom 800+ gave their lives) and navy sailors, the Russian Convoys in the end played a role in the cooling of relations between Stalin and his allies.  <br />Written from the British perspective, Schofield's account  is a very compatent overview of this aspect of the war.  It is, however, like many works from this period (it was published in 1964) not that well referenced and apparently not that exhaustively researched.	2002-08-06

As one of the few pilots to survive the entire war (especially considering the fact that he flew Stukas for the majority of the time) his experiences provide for and facinating and unique look at the nature of winged-warfare on the Eastern Front.  While there is no denying that he must have been a brave and capable flier to be decorated as he was, one view what he writes with some measure of scepticism.  If not fabricated, some of his recollections are without a doubt embellished.  The nature of warfare in the air--as far as an arm-chair pilot such as myself can tell--is such that fully comprehending the chaos around one in the midst of combat makes it difficult for even the most astute person to have an accurate understanding afterwards of what happened.  Successes were almost always exaggerated by pilots from all nationalities, and there is no reason to believe that Rudel just as prone to doing so.  Whatever the case, the book is very interesting and is a must read for any WWII buff.	2002-08-04

Were this the case, then it is clear that some of Charles' perceived short-comings would have been glossed over; but instead, we do get a fair sense about the man who will be the future King of England.  He is by no means a gregarious, powerful figure, and, unfortunately and quite unjustly, he has been criticized for this, and some, including his now deceased ex-wife, have gone so far as to suggest that he is not suited for the job.  Unfortunately, the people suggesting such things have succeeded in instilling some doubt in the minds of the British people as to whether this is in fact the case, but it is quite evident from what I have read that this is complete ...  Granted, Charles does not fit the bill of the warrior king, but there is no doubt that he is a sensitive, well-educated and benevolent person who will undoubtably be well suited for the role of King in this current day and age.  One thing that struck me as notable about Charles is his passion for certain causes and ideals, including organic farming and architecture.  His opinions on these subjects has raised a few eyebrows and no doubt gave his detractors some fuel for their arguments.  But his opinions on these, and other issues, are quite sound and indicate that he is a man well versed in modern issues and could prove to be a quite progressive monarch.  Unfortunately, many are blinded to this aspect of the man by a superficial devotion to his deceased ex-wife, whose unfortunate behaviour during the latter years of their relationship succeeded in fooling many people.	2002-08-04

I have read an earlier edition of this work (from the 1970s), and cannot comment on any additions that the author has made, as I can imagine that she would have to add some notes to make dated references more comprehensible.<br />Anyway, this book chronicles the trials and experiences of the author and her husband after they abandoned \\"modern\\" life and headed for the hills of North Wales.  Their friends, of course, thought they were nuts, but they kept at it, and after years of setbacks, finally began to eek out a living.  <br />West's writing is smooth and vibrant and she really manages to capture the essence of the failures and successes that they endured.  The book is a real page turner, and is one of those that one wishes was at least twice or three-times as long.	2002-08-04

The author served as a bomber pilot through part of the war and was eventually promoted to the commanding rank of the Luftwaffe's bomber force.  He was but 29 years of age at war's end.   <br />Baumbach begins by discussing the formative years of the Luftwaffe following the First World War and then discusses certain pressing issues that arose following Hitler's rise to power, issues such as the decision to develop a medium rather than a heavy bomber force, which would have significant consequences during the war.<br />The author also provides interesting insight into the problems facing the Luftwaffe and rivalries and lack of coordination which impeded the ability for it successfully adapt to the nature of arial combat during the war.  His general premise is that had the Luftwaffe developed a heavy bomber force, not persisted in developing numerous time and resource wasting prototypes, and focused on the development on some promising weaponry such as guided bombs, Germany may have been able to beat back the assault on Fortress Europa.<br />This work, which was first published in Germany shortly after the war, of course has to be approached with a certain degree of skepticism when it comes to his own subjective interpretations of certain peoples and events.   All in all, though, it is an interesting read.	2002-08-03

Although the work does deal with the distant formative era of Brandenburg-Prussia during the rule of the Ascanian dynasty, the primary focus of the book is the period following 1525.  Central themes include the development of the Prussian army, economic reform, and the evolution of the administrative system.  The book is an excellent starting point for further study of the Kingdom of Prussia.	2002-08-03

It's an accusation that Mowat of course denies, but who knows?   There is really no one but the author himself in a position to know what really happened, what has been left out, what has been embellished all for the sake of making the book more readable and entertaining.<br />Does it really matter, though?  To my knowledge, Mowat never mentions that the intention of this book was to serve as an accurate and scholarly study of wolf behaviour.  The intent of the book was to put forth his personal opinion concerning why wolves were supposedly slaughtering cariboo indiscriminantly.<br />The government had sent him up there with the belief (or at least professing the belief) that there was a problem with the wolf population.  What Mowat discovered, however, was that wolf behaviour was in fact very regulated, that wolves hunted selectively.  These mass killings of cariboo, he found, were not the result of the wolves, but of hunters from the South, primarily from the United States, who would fly in, blast away, and take a few trophies home, leaving the rest to rot.  Trappers, in turn, exploited this situation: they complained to the government that the wolves were a problem and wanted a bounty to be implemented, so that, obviously, they could then cash in on it.  <br />Whether authentic or slightly altered, Never Cry Wolf is a fascinating story and an important work of Canadian literature.  Mowat's advocacy for such issues as the environment and Native rights was ground-breaking and of fundamental importance to current and future generations.  I would hope, then, that people who read this book will regarded as more than just a &quot;good read&quot; and that they will make an effort to understand its deeper message.	2002-08-02

A lover of the North, Mowat had written passionately and extensively about it from the Canadian perspective, and had now been given the opportunity to see how the peoples of the North faired under Communist rule.  Naturally, he found things to be somewhat different, most notably in the manner in which these peoples were (evidently) treated.  In general, he observed that the native peoples of Siberia--under the rule of a totalitarian regime--were better treated than those in Canada.  But the fact still remains, however, that to a greater degree than in Canada, the Russians had settled Siberia and hence conquered it in the typical western fashion.  While critical of such encroachments in a North American context, Mowat is quite clearly impressed by the manner in which it was accomplished in Siberia, and was equally impressed by the resiliant spirit of the newer Siberians.  Still, the author is not so easily enamoured by the workings of any authoritarian governmental system, and his contempt for the Soviet politicians does not go unmentioned.  Despite this, the book  may have played a part in putting him in the bad books of another authoritarian regime, the results of which he chronicles in the slim volume entitled My Discovery of America.	2002-08-02

I have to say that I really loved the book, so much so that I read it again after my first time through--something that I haven't for years.  I'll admit that the first time through I was fairly accepting of the fact that the book (despite the author's claim at the end that a few facts and names were altered out of necessity) was a fairly authentic account of the people Berendt had encountered in Savannah and, more importantly, the trial of the book's central character, Jim Williams.  Subsequent &quot;research&quot; on the Internet led me to realize that Berendt's fictionalizing of the plot was  apparently quite extensive.  This did dampen my enthusiasm a little, but after reading it a second time through, there is no denying that Midnight is simply a great (and entertaining) read.	2002-07-31

I have actually read the earlier edition of this work and therefore am not certain exactly what was added for the 1983 re-issue, but unless Kerr did a wholesale rewrite incorporating much of the extensive (mostly German) scholarship on the war in the Eastern Front, this book really has little to offer.  The book addresses the Battle of Stalingrad not so much from the significance it had for the German war effort, than for the battle's importance in the disintigrating relationship between Stalin and his western allies.  The book nevertheeless primarily discusses the course of events prior to the surrender of the German 6th Army on February 2, 1943, and only the occssional reference is made to the suppossed central topic of the book.  But one can not be too harsh in criticizing the author since it is quite clear that the sources available to him are quite limited and either biased and/or falsified to some degree.  The author was himself, as a journalist for a New York newspaper, in the Soviet Union at the time and does record some of his own impressions and encounters with some of the key figures in the battle.  So even though the book is really of limited value, it is still one that someone interested in the topic should still consider reading.	2002-07-31

Her analysis of the neoconservative agenda to dismantle governmental involvement in social programs is both clear and articulate. The general point that McQuiag makes is that Canadians have been fed a bogus line by neoconservatives when it comes to the financial burden caused by the government's involvement in social programs. Drawing on examples from Europe, she argues that countries that spend considerably more of their GDP on social programs have lower crime and poverty rates, etc. and do not have larger deficits (since they have relatively high tax rates). Where the reverse is the truth, such as in the US and South Africa, what we find is a much more pronounced inequality between the rich and the poor. Canada, McQuaig claimed, was at the crossroads in 1993--either we could go the Europeans route, or adopt the American approach, which of course is what the neoconservatives would prefer. But why? Does it have to do with saving taxpayers money, improving services by allowing private corporations to operate day care centres or provide medical insurance? Nope. It all has to do with power, and the pathetic notion that the wealthy and elite have concerning those who are poor, disabled and unemployed--this is their lot in life, so why should we [the rich] have to pay their way? In essence, McQuaig exposes the true nature of Canadian society--which is very much contrary to the image that is presented to the rest of the world--and this discomforts many people, and downright irritates those who have much to lose from Canadian society becoming more equitable.	2002-07-07
US	50833636	R21MTTEI380EIV	0140058508	499822874	1066: The Year of the Conquest	Books	3	9	11	N	N	An intersting and entertaining read, but...	In writing this book, the author claims to have used as his source the some 20 existing &quot;contemporary&quot; sources (dating from shortly after the invasion until a century or so afterwards) in piecing together what he feels is a fair account of this pivotal year in English history.  He makes it very clear that this is no simple task when taking into consideration the style and bias of his sources, and therefore the story is by no means the complete account that we expect from historical works dealing with more recent events.  So unfortunately, by no fault of the author, we have but a fragmentary account of the events of 1066.  But--not being all that familiar with this time period--as much as the author has attempted to not &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; with his own fanciful theories and assumptions, it is difficult to not believe that there are times when he may have embellished things a tad.  All in all, though, 1066: The Year of the Conquest is an enjoyable book, and an excellent starting point for those who want to understand a little more about this period in English history.	2002-06-30

This is my first Dave Barry encounter, and for the most part I have to say that I found him quite amusing.  There were, however, several instances when I thought that maybe he went a little too far, and then came the chapter on Hiroshima.  This chapter is preceeded and followed by a leaf printed darker which obviously is intended to indicate that the book is going to get serious for a moment.  I was curious to read what his thoughts were, what the reactions of a comedian--an American comedian--would be to what he experiences.   He writes the following about his visit to the memorial museum in Hiroshima: <br />\\"I found myself weeping, out of sorrow and helplessness and guilt.  But I also felt anger.  Because the way the museum presents it, the atomic bomb was like a lightning bolt--something nobody could forsee, and nobody could prevent.  It was as though one day, for no reason, the Americans came along, literally out of the blue, and did this horrible thing to these innocent people.<br />\\"I don't know if it's possible to justify what happened to Hiroshima--I certainly wouldn't try to justify it to the victims' families.  But I found myself wanting to shout to the other museum visitors: Do you know WHY my country did this?  Do you wonder what would make a civilized country do such a thing?\\"<br />This is the point where I really lost interest in the book.  Sure, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it is quite evident that Dave Barry just does not get it when it comes to this matter.  Yes, why, indeed, would a \\"civilized\\" country do such a thing?  Certainly because it had no other choice, because they were forced to do so by the knowledge that were the Americans to invade Japan itself, it would actually face resistence from millions of civilians--something the Americans would themselves do.  The argument that the bombs were dropped in order to \\"save lives\\" is weak, and does not take into consideration the geo-political developments in July and August, as well as the fact that  there were simply people in the United States who wanted to see what an A-Bomb could really do. <br />Unfortunately, I have a habit of finishing books, no matter how bad, and no matter how long it takes, so finishing this one to the end was like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard the rest of the way (which was fortunately not long).  Although by the end my disgust with the Hiroshima chapter wore away somewhat, but it will take a while before I get around to reading another Dave Barry work.	2002-05-10
