There was no real substance to their relationship or, for that matter, to them.  Jack was not loveable in the least. I couldn't see what Arabella saw in him.  And when they do find his sister in the French prison, I was really hoping for a happy ending to that situation, but was sadly disappointed there as well.	2005-05-17

The story was believable, the characters were all charming, the dialogue was witty.  I could not put this one down, I wanted it to go on and on.  I enjoyed the character of Cecily, Lilith's neice.  The author didn't make her out to be some sippid and vapid girl, but a very smart, matter-of-fact young woman, who at times knew more about men than her widowed aunt. I highly recommend this one.	2005-03-01

The beginning was fun with Richard and Isabel matching wits with one another, trying to out-do each other with their thievery.  But then by the middle it started to slow down and I wasn't so involved any more.  I found the love scenes to be one dimensional and too simple.  I felt no heat whatsoever.  The story just dragged on and on, I could even jump three paragraphs or a whole page ahead and not miss anything.  I lost all interest in all of the characters.  Not a keeper, IMO. For a great read, try her series starting with 'Once a Dreamer'.	2004-12-30

I did not read the prequels (Miracle and Devotion) before reading this and I have to say that it didn't matter.  I was able to gleen enough of their previous story in this one and didn't feel lost at all.  It was compelling and riveting.  I found the characters to be very well written and the love in which Trey felt for Maria (and yes, his brother)was poignant. What they went through was nothing short of tragic and what he did to get Maria back and bring her back to normalcy was incredibly heroic.  I even felt sorry at times for Edwina (I wouldn't mind reading her story in the future). <br /> <br />I love a good romance with a touch of tragedy thrown in as long as there's a happy ending.  In a way I'm glad I didn't read Devotion first because I have a feeling I wouldn't have been as satisfied.  With Obsession I know there's a happy ending.  I didn't care that there were no sex scenes. <br /> <br />I was riveted from cover to cover and Trey and Maria will stay with me for a long time to come.  That's the mark of an excellent story and a superb story teller.	2004-12-23

I was not disappointed in the least! As I was reading, I couldn't help but feel so sad for Wulf because he was so lonely. He always set himself apart from everyone else.  He felt always on the outside looking in. Christine was perfect for Wulfric. Complete opposites. I enjoyed watching them interact together and laughed along with her antics, especially the times (yes, it was more than once, and that's what makes it so funny!) when Wulf had to save her from disgrace. He was so out of his element, I got such a kick out of watching his reactions to her predicaments. I got misty-eyed when, finally, the haughty and icey Duke of Bewcastle let out a laugh and actually smiled! This was pure romance at it's best! Brava, Ms. Balogh, for a truly wonderful story and for giving us a glimpse into a loveable and entertaing family, the Bedwyns. I loved it!	2004-06-17

She is only one of a very few authors who never fails to make me chuckle out loud and when I come to the end of her stories, I'm grinning like a loon. This was such an enjoyable and entertaining read, with such lovable characters.  Hayden is one of those tortured heroes that you can't help but fall madly in love with and Lottie is so deft at healing his and his daughter, Allegra's, broken heart and tattered soul.

It was light and entertaining, with strong, well written characters, but I give it only three stars because it's not very original.  This is just &quot;Affair&quot;,&quot;With this Ring&quot;, and &quot;I Thee Wed&quot; all over again, only with different characters.  Ms. Quick needs to find a new subject matter.  I found her &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and &quot;Late for the Wedding&quot; series better and more refreshing. I look forward to more installments from that series. <br />One great thing about Amanda Quick is the names she gives her protaganists.  A hero can have a name like Arthur and still be handsome, strong, intelligent and get the beautiful girl and not be just some wimp who ends up as a background character.	2004-05-27

It starts out well but by the middle goes downhill. It just didn't hold my interest at all. I couldn't even finish it. I didn't care if they got together or not.  The main characters where pretty one-dimentional. I give it three stars for drawing me in at the beginning. Maybe one day I'll go back and finish it. Maybe. Also, one thing that really annoys(sp) me is when I'm reading a Regency-era book and it's filled with contractions!).	2004-05-21

I won't go into a summary here. But I, too, found it troubling when I came across a few 20th century phrases (&quot;...Ginny Highgate, aka Mary Harris.&quot; as one example that quickly comes to mind). I was enjoying it up until the part where Lord Strathmore is confronted in White's by the leader of the Horse and Chariot club and is told of Elizabeth's kidnapping.  I felt Strathmore gave up too easily and became 'wimpy'. Here's a guy who supposedly spent time with American Indians, went on raids with them, collecting scalps, and when he's confronted with his nemisis, who's threatening the woman he loves, he just gives up without a fight.  Not until he's told of her &quot;death&quot; does he go into a rage. I find that very wimpy. Lizzie is unbelievable as well. I find it hard to believe that she falls into bed with Devlin at the first meeting. Instead of calling him &quot;My lord&quot; or by his title, which is the proper thing to do (and she should know better after all), she refers to him by his given name almost immediately. If one is  a stickler about such things, this will be annoying.<br />This was a good book, but even better ones are the previous three in this series.	2004-05-03

Her stories are fun and full of wit, not to mention lovable (and believable) characters. If you haven't read her yet, may I suggest &quot;The Diamond Key&quot;. It was my first B. Metzger and turned me into an instant fan!<br />This was my first by Ms. Porter but most definitely not my last. She writes in the style of Ms. Putney, only with more attention to detail of the period. &quot;The Road to Ruin&quot; was very well written with a beginning that draws the reader instantly into the story, characters that you immediately fall in love with, dialogue that is very well written, and secondary characters that you definitely want to know more about. The &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; was a bit drawn out, but I found it very difficult to put this book down and once it was over, I missed it. A true test of an excellently written book and an exceptional author!	2004-03-22

It was flat, the characters were flat, the dialogue was dumb. I'm sorry folks. I don't know what everyone else who gave this book 5 stars read, but it certainly wasn't this one.

First, the title is unoriginal (Mary Jo Putney has a book by this title, which was more enjoyable. I highly recommend it).  Second, it took forever for this book to come out and it's understandable that sometimes circumstances happen beyond the author's control. But seeing as how she had over 2 years to write this dribble, I expected better. I couldn't get through even the first 10 pages before I gave up. The characters were so one-dimensional as to be unbelievable. Come on! What police captain would send two homicide detectives to investigate an automobile accident? The dialogue and interaction between the characters was flat and boring. At least I had the foresight not to spend my hard-earned money on it.  Thank God for libraries! I'll stick with her historicals, but any future suspense? No way. Judith, stick to what you do best. Whitney, My Love is one of THE BEST books ever written, IMHO.	2003-06-28

Now if I know my geography, that's WEST from Texas and Georgia is EAST! 300+ mi. west on horseback to go to Atlanta? All because 1 person MIGHT recognize her? Uh-uh. That's when I decided this book wasn't doing it for me. Romantic Times gave it 4 1/2G stars? Not in my book.

I picked up this one and was intrigued by the story line. After reading some of these reviews, I still thought I'd give it a try for myself. I love historicals, especially medievals and am very familiar with that part of history. Knowing that in those days girls were betrothed as young as 8 or 9 years old, her young age didn't bother me.  It was the adultery I couldn't get my mind around. Let's be real. In those days, if it were known, she'd have been hanged or tortured to death. Eloquent prose is one thing, having a \\"heroine\\" commit the unpardonable is another.	2003-01-16

The story is simply written but that's not to say it's boring or not well done.  It's engrossing from start to finish and I found myself enraged on Julie's and Hank's part each time they were taken in by swindlers.  They go through such devistation you're hoping for some mercy on their part.  I was very pleased to also see that Godly beliefs were a large factor in this story.

I happened to pick it up because of the title and cover. When I read the synopsis on the back and the prologue, I was hooked. I couldn't wait to read it. I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. The main characters were very likable. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was the style of writing. Personally, I prefer past-tense writing rather than present tense. I'll have to check out her other books to see if it's typical of this author. Also, the killer's reasons for, well, killing, are a bit unbelievable. I won't give anything away here. And lastly, by reading this book I can tell that she grew up in that area because she mentions a popular local supermarket, and all the other times she goes into great detail about what the characters bought and at what stores. Not necessary. I found it a bit irritating and I live in Western New York. But those are personal preferences and shouldn't deter anyone from checking out this good read.	2002-04-12

Given us another powerful story with another subject that has, up until now, never been seen and has been off limits in the romance genre. One that is filled with characters you can sympathize with and love.  Before it was rape and incest (Dearly Beloved), then it was spousal abuse (Burning Point, the prequel to this) and now it's, shock of shockers, pedophilia. She does it masterfully in the character of Kenzie Scott, a man who uses the art of acting to escape from the terrible tragedy of his past. He became a master at it until a sequence of events caused his wall to come crashing down, almost destroying him. Rainey is wonderfully crafted as the loving and supportive wife who helps bring him back from the abyss of despare,and in the process brings about her own healing from memories of a mother who died from a drug overdose and was mostly absent from her life. The way Ms. Putney brings them through the paths they must take to heal and be whole again is wrenching at times, but necessary. One thing I was looking for in the classic MJ Putney style but was missing was the dramatic scenes that gave glimpses of what the characters went through. But with this particular subject matter, there are things better left unsaid. Thank you for sparing us that, Ms. Putney. At times though it got a bit bogged down in the minucia of movie making, but that didn't take away from the fact that I could not put this book down to save my life. That's the reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5. Also, because it was a great first read, but not a keeper. The dialogue was a bit flat as well sometimes. But I look forward to seeing these characters again in her future books about this circle of friends. Brava, Ms. Putney!	2002-01-08

When she's writing historicals, she's fantastic but with each of her contemporaries, she falls way short. Because it was Julie, I wanted to give her a chance but struggled to get through the first 3 chapters, hoping she'd redeem herself, but I couldn't stomach it. The premis of the story pulls the reader in, but that's all I can say that's good about this book. I wish she'd go back to writing the historicals and stay away from the suspense.

The terror he relives of drowning in his dreams each night as he sleeps keeps him from ever letting him fall in love. His greatest wish, though is to marry some day, have a family and fill his boyhood home, Ravens Close, with the love and joy he had growing up.  He fears he will never experience that dream for he has been exiled. Banished by the Uncle he loves for a crime he didn't commit. Then he receives a letter from his uncle calling him home, wanting a reconciliation. But he must face his greatest fear. His step-aunt, who was the cause of his bannishment for lies she created and honor that she stole from him.<br />Georgia Wells has a few secrets of her own that she keeps. Widow of a man whom she experienced nothing but pain, she was forced into a life of servitude and near slavery. She ends up as the modiste of the lady of Ravenswalk.  Kept in her tower room like Repunzel, she slaves away for a woman who is pure evil incarnate, who likes nothing more than to userp her power over those she deems lower than herself. <br />When Nicholas finally arrives home to claim the home he loves, he finds his uncle in a state of apoplexy and his step-aunt in charge.  She informs him that he will not receive his inheritance until and unless he is married in three weeks.  <br />Feeling nothing short of dispair, he goes to his home to find it in a state of total disrepair. Georgia and Nicholas meet and it comes to him later that she is the one who can help him get his home back.<br />NO GREATER LOVE is one of Katherine Kingsley's greatest. The relationship between Nicholas and Georgia is one of great love that we see develop gradualy. The dialoge is whitty and superb. They draw us in to their life with such great ease and warmth, the reader can't help but fall in love with them right from the start.  The way that Nicholas and Georgia help each other through their most difficult times is only the most touching part of this truly superb story. If you can find one, I suggest you grab it. You will not be disappointed. But keep the Kleenex handy for the ending. You'll need it.	2000-12-08
