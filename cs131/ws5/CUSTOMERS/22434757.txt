The Bible is full of sex and profanity, among other things.  Where do you think we get our stories from?  The Bible is the basis for everything that is written or that has been written or that will be written.  Science fiction, love stories, murder mysteries, westerns, gangsters, doctors stories, law and police stories, witchcraft stories, mummy stories, ghosts stories, stories of desertion, physical and verbal abuse, stories of lust, sex, desire, temptations, deception, confusion, homosexuality, sports competition and events, etc.--all originated from the HOLY BIBLE.  There is NOTHING new under the sun.  In keeping with reality, therefore, Christians DO curse and commit SIN. Christian fiction is a BROAD term just like fiction itself.  The only thing that distinguishes \\"Christian\\" fiction from \\"Mainstream\\" fiction is that it contains spirituality in some fashion.  We need to get off of this kick that Christians are pefect and don't commit fornication, use profanity, listen to secular music, dance and sing the lyrics to hip-hop or R&B, or do other sinful things.  I am a Christian, but I'm not perfect and I read this book and it was alright.  If so-called Christians would write with reality in their novels (like Kimberla Lawson Roby - \\"Too Much of a Good Thing\\"), then maybe their stories wouldn't be \\"so boring.\\"  To me, For Love and Grace was just another BET-type romance novel excluding sex scenes.	2004-02-19

Our community needs to take a look at this serious subject and come up with an answer.  This book depicts abuse and a case of unlawful imprisonment, which is a good story to tell that has not been told.  I applaud the author for being bold in writing about this subject matter.

There was very little dialogue for a 550 page novel.  Chapter and chapter filled with nothing but narratives which makes it a slow and drawn out read.  I, too, had to read into the first 200 pages before the story started to connect.  It would be good for the author to practice backdrop into storylines to get to matter of the story swifter.  Took me over a month to finish this one when I usually finish a novel within two or three days.  Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it.	2004-02-09

Even though Pastor Landis has always held a special love for her, he knew his limitations.  This is what caused Teresa to become so suspicious and insecured. He caused this reaction in her.  He has placed a &quot;stumbling block&quot; in his fiancee's path when the Bible distinctly informs us not to do this.  Therefore, he is not as &quot;pure&quot; as some may believe.  He held lust in his heart for Johnnie, but tried to conceal it.  &quot;If a man looks upon a woman to lust after her he has committed adultery in his heart.&quot;  Pastor Landis is guilty of this.

I believe that EVERY woman has experienced a form of abuse in her life in one way or another.  Nonetheless, this was probably a form of therapy for the author to get it off of her chest and move on with her life.  I would not be interested in a three part to this book because it is too typical and elementary written.

I find it offensive when I hear people comparing this book to Victoria christopher Murphey's book &quot;Temptation.&quot;  Love and Grace is far, far, better than Temptation.  I don't know what all the hoopla is about Temptation because it bored me stiff.  Heck, I don't know what y'all talkin' about (I got an attitude now). [smile] Vicki Murphey needs to take some pointers from this author. <br />I would've given Love and Grace a five star but when I got to the end, I was livid!  The author turned this raw, sweet, story into a fairytale.  The surprise guests at the wedding scene was like the movie &quot;Coming to America,&quot; when the prince lifted the veil of his bride, chosen by the King, only to find it was the women he really wanted to marry.  Please!  Give me a break!  I wanted it to end on a more solid note or on a more personal wedding.  I must admit that it was kinda cute when she walked in and saw all of the police there and thought it was because of a stalker female who was after her husband-to-be, only to find out that they were there because of the high profile musical guests.  None of them to my liking.  But then again, I didn't write the story -- I just read it, enjoyed it, and reviewed it.	2004-01-29

This is why this novel applies to all.  It was a good idea to put a list of STDs in the back of the book.  She covered all the basis in this book.  I'm passing it on, not just because it was a good book, but hopefully to be able to help others.  Outstanding job.  Oh, by the way, I like the character list in the front of the book.

I really enjoyed her novel.  She uses language that we so often find coming out of the mouths of Christians, which gives the story a flare of reality (sorry to those of you who do not think that Christians are capable of sinning and using profanity).  I love how she probes questions and plots on \\"works of the flesh\\" and the psychology of sexual perversion and addiction.<br />What a fresh look into alternative reasoning.  Even though some of the characters are unlikeable, the author makes you care about what happens to them regardless.  This is great and enjoyable read!

I realize that it is a story written as a memoir of a young woman's journey in a life that spans about 20 years.  It is a good first attempt at Christian fiction.	2004-01-26

However, I believe some of the things in this book, but for the most part, many Christian fiction that contains sexual explicit language and profanity are popular moreso than literary and have proven to be successful, such as, \\"Casting The First Stone\\" and the sequel, \\"Too Much of a Good Thing,\\" and \\"Promises Beyond Jordan.\\"  I recognize that this type of Christian fiction is geared towards getting the weaker Christians to see themselves and turn from their wicked ways before it's too late.  I've recently been turned on to a novel called, \\"Lust of the Flesh,\\" another Christian fiction with has a very strong and critical message to the weak Christians.  I highly recommend this read.  These types of Christian books are written for a different type of Christian group. It is to get them to look in a mirror at their lives and to show them the error of their ways.  Once they reach this level, they will graduate to a higher degree of Christianity. <br />This higher degree of Christianity is directed to a diffent Christian group which are the stronger Christians to encourage their walk.  These types of books are:  \\"Temptation,\\" \\"No Regrets,\\" and \\"That Faith, That Love, That Trust.\\"<br />We must keep in mind which Christian group we are writing for.  Are we writing to encourage the strong Christian to remain stedfast and unmovable?  Or are we writing to mirror the weak Christian to turn from his/her wicked ways and seek the face of God so that he/she can move on to perfection as a strong Christian?<br />Christian fiction that contacts sex and profanity will turn off a strong Christian because he/she has moved on to perfection from that lifestyle.  However, sexual language and profanity will appeal to a weak Christian because he/she has not graduated yet.  We must use wisdom.<br />I think this about sums it up between which Christian audience  an author is attempting to reach.	2004-01-26

The voice of reason reminded me of Sistah Souljah's voice in Coldest Winter Ever.  However, I saw the author on a panel of C-SPAN Booknotes and was disappointed with her performance.  She didn't appear to be articulate or languistic.  She constantly drank from her water bottle.  Her eyes protruded around the room as if she held a grudge against everyone in the room.  Maybe she was upset because she was the only black panelist and only female panelist.  Maybe she was nervous.  I was hoping to hear her talk about her book, but she didn't much.

Since a few of my colleagues have placed their reviews, I thougth I'd put my two cents in.<br />Lust of the Flesh is a novel ideal on bringing out the subject of sexual perversion and addiction.  Now I have a clear idea of what Halle Berry's husband has been going through with his sexual addiction.  Ms. Rolyat has challenged us to look into the realm of spiritual demonic forces as the reason for this form of behavior.  <br />I enjoyed her philosophical and theological reasoning from scriptural standpoint on fleshly desires.  I am looking forward to reading her parts 2 and 3 of this trilogy.  It has a lot of potential to be made into a movie or mini-series.  Congratulations and Kudos to Ms. Rolyat for a job well done.  I've learned some things from this book and unfortunately, I can't say that about many of the AA novels I've read.	2004-01-22

She chose to \\"expose\\" (as I like the way one reviewer stated it) a subject that the Christian community avoids like the plague. She didn't write this enlightening story from a judgmental point, but rather an eye-opening point of view and she did it as such to keep the reader's attention. The cover of the book said that it was a \\"Knots Landing waiting to happen.\\"  I couldn't agree more.  I'm from the Knots Landing, Dallas and Dynasty era.  This book portrayed such complexed and sexually driven characters that one would have to think that hmmmmmm...maybe there is a perverted spirit lurking in these people.  It makes you even check your own self to see if there may be one lying within you if you are sexually active and promiscuous. <br />It all started with Big Blue.  He knew that he had a lot of perverted spirits in him because he went to a psychic and she told him.  He was the father of two girls and a boy and also the father of a set of illegitimate twins.  His one daughter was a prostitute and his son was homosexual.  The twin girl...well, I'll let you read that part, and the twin boy...well that's another really good part that you'll enjoy reading.  I don't want to give the story away.  <br />Then there's a teenager name Ellee.  She is the most twisted, sexually promiscuous teenager I have ever seen.  You know she got a sex demon in her.  But Ben is totally possessed with a high craving for sex.  He is so twisted in his mind until you almost feel sorry for him.  These sexual spirits jump from flesh to flesh.<br />To sum it all up, this book is the alter ego of ZANE's books.  The essence of it all is this:  be careful who you sleep with because he or she might have a sex demon and \\"give it to you.\\"  Some people think that its good to have a high sex drive, but you can catch all kinds of diseases as the author stated in her book if you have multiple partners.  She's only tellin you what Aretha Franklin says:  \\"You Better Think!\\"<br />There are so many things that you will learn and enjoy about Lust of the Flesh.  I'm having a real good time talking about this book and I recommend it to you.  I'm on the lookout for the second series in this trilogy.	2004-01-08

It is a very thick book with many pages (around 540 pages or so) and not a quick read at all.  It takes until about the first 150 pages or more to really find out what the book is really about and what is actually going on.  I was totally lost in the first 80 or 90 pages.  I am a book lover and I found myself wanting to just give up and toss this book aside, but I decided against that.<br />Another thing about the book is that the author wrote it entirely too proper, which makes it boring.  She should have loosened up her language and dialogue.<br />I really struggled to finish it.  I heard that there is a sequel to this book, but I doubt that I'll read it, since this book is an indication of slow, boring and overly written.<br />I don't mean to sound discouraging, but this is what reviews are all about.  I am only speaking the truth from my perspective.  Mrs. Groversnor has writing potential, no doubt, but she just needs to tighten up on her storytelling approach, get to point of her story more swiftly and excitingly, and use a thesaurus more often in simplifying words.  <br />Thank you.	2004-01-02

From page one until the end, there was nothing but controversy.  Brother against brother--brother against wife--brother against girlfriend--brother against dad--brother against the world!  Nearly in every chapter, the brothers were either fighting each other or cursing each other out.<br />The story is told mostly in narratives.  The dialogue is a bit offy considering these are African-American men and women speaking.  Especially considering the fact that the men had to practically raise themselves after their mother died.<br />Austin's character did not appeal to me.  He just didn't seem like a real black man.  He seemed like a foreigner who could not come to grips with American family culture.   <br />The character, Blue, for him to have been a &quot;street hood,&quot; and no doubt a school dropout, he spoke entirely too intelligent, although most street hoods are very insightful.<br />Although Mr. Johnson did a good job with introducing the reader to each scene, it seems as though he's written this book as a screenplay.<br />I must admit, however, there is some truth to character environment, i.e., my dad left me and my mom, so I think I'll do the same thing to my family.<br />I'm just giving my honest opinion.
