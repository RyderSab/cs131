What was Captain Picard doing?  Keith R.A. DeCandido did a brilliant job editing and collecting the stories for this anthology. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the tale spun by DeCandido delving into the attack on Betazed and the aftermath.  He did an incredible job weaving the strings of the novel about the liberation of this world and the young Andorian that was introduced in the Deep Space Nine novels. <br /> <br />Captain Picard was on Earth during the attack of the Breen and his story was interesting if not overly staged.  The idea of the story was good but so constructed it was hard to believe. <br /> <br />Suprisingly one of my favorite stories was the tale of DeCandido's character Klag.  The Klingon Captain was constantly dealing with the lost of his arm, and now we truly hear the tale of the great battle Marcan V.  This was one of the best tales of Klag and not even written by DeCandido. <br /> <br />	2004-09-20

I am not sure why I liked this novel but it is getting the highest rating I can give it. <br /> <br />This novel is a step into the ability of the Enterprise crew to pull off true miracles.  They are given a mission that they are expected to fail at but with little time, less help and incredible levels of luck, they pull of this feat of greatness and surprise. <br /> <br />The real power of this story is the portrayal of the Federation.  If you enjoyed the Deep Space Nine episode `In the Pale Moonlight' then you will love this novel.   <br />	2004-09-16

I did enjoy the story and the adventures that Card told but I felt that this story was a stopping point-a temporary detour as he regrouped.  I felt that this tale was an attempt to finish the story he started and gather the characters he needed to reach the Crystal City. <br /> <br />This is a very important book in the series.  It introduces characters that I feel are going to be fundamental to the conclusion of the Alvin Maker series.  If have been enjoying this gift from Card, you need to pick this book up and struggle through the slight lulls and finish this one. <br />	2004-09-10

Each year I delve into the collection hoping to be capture by the amateur tails woven together by the wonderful editor Dean Wesley Smith.  Each year I miss a night of sleep as I struggle to put it down.  This year was no different. <br /> <br />The grand prize winner this year was `Life's Work' is a wonderful tail of the final android that we know Dr. Soong created.  Last year I questioned the grand prize winner but this year I am in full agreement.  This creation was not the most original but was the best written summation this year. <br /> <br />One story I personally enjoyed was `Full Circle.'  It was a great return to the Captain of the Enterprise-B during the mission the Federation lost Kirk.  Now he is involved in the mission that returned Kirk to save the Veridian people. <br /> <br />This collection is one of the best in the last few years.  My personal enjoyment in the group of stories is the ability for these fans to be great story tellers and select the smallest hook from the episodes to stretch out of. <br /> <br />Pick up this collection and loose some sleep. <br />	2004-08-13

I really enjoyed half of this book but I was not enthralled by the other half. <br /> <br />'The Lotus Flower' <br /> <br />This story returns the O'briens back to the world of Deep Space 9.  I jumped for joy when I read Unity and saw their return.  I almost burst into tears when I struggled through this first half of the book.  The story was great.  The writing was everything I expected.  I just felt that this story robbed the O'brien family of who they were. <br /> <br />'Paradigm' <br /> <br />The second story of this book delves into the relationship of two characters introduces in the novels.  I enjoyed watching Prynn and Thane struggle to survive the culture they view as foreign.  This adventure lets us explore the world of Andor and learn more about the people of this founding Federation world. <br /> <br />As a fan of DS9 I have to recommend this book.  I love to follow the adventures of these characters I fell in love with over seven seasons.  I want to see the world and places grow over time in the novels and worlds of Deep Space 9. <br />	2004-07-30

The population is turning violent and the crew is stretched thin trying to put out the fires, both literally and figuratively.<br />This is a wonderful character study of not just the regular cast but as well as new character including the security chief.  In addition we get to explore Riker search for his father and struggle with the ailing relationship.<br />I was disappointed in the clichés used in the end of the first part of the story.  Riker finding his father at gunpoint and Crusher informing Picard that the cure for this planet is also the cause of the disaster it is facing.  It gave me a false sense of expectations for the second part.	2004-07-07

This gas also shaved years off of each generation.  In an attempt to solve this problem, Starfleet Medical releases an outbreak of violence threatening to tear the planet apart.<br />In the truest Star Trek fashion, the grand medical tea of the Enterprise comes to the rescue with a cure.  But in a way only The Next Generation can do, they argue the morality of this cure and force the Picard into deciding the fate of this world.<br />In the second plot line, the Rikers-Will and Kyle-struggle to bring an end to the violence in their own way.  They find the initial victim of Starfleet's error and try to return him to the medics to help bring about a cure.  I will not spoil the story for you but this is the plot line that is most like a red herring.  I was shocked at the resolution.  I loved every word but felt my emotions yanked perpendicular to where I was headed.<br />This story is does include the proposal of marriage and the offer of the Titan to Riker.  There was no surprise with either of these two.  But this is not the final section of this book and this little footnote to the story, the finale, bring about more questions.	2004-07-07

While part one of this two part series seemed like a pursuit into the life and times of Charles Tucker III, this one was a little more balanced in its use of the crew of the Enterprise.<br />I liked the way Stern delved into the histories of the character by bringing up the striking differences between this stories universe and the real one.  We get to see the struggle of Archer and crew to fight the ailments of this universe and obtain their freedom from the quarreling factions in this universe.<br />This was a very good completion to a well develop story.  Having finished them both part of me would have liked to see them combined into one novel.  There seemed to a little too much filler but more story then a single novel.

I believe this was one of the best choices I have ever made.  This is a relatively short novel but beware, once you finish the first one, you are going to search out the remaining volumes of the series.  <br />The writing of Mr. Card is simply incredible.  I have read a few of his books directed to writers and often his primary focus is on characterization.  Now that I have delved into a novel and absorbed his use of his own tools, I say thank you.<br />This is an alternate history, which I normally avoid, but the slight elements of magic move it into the realm of fantasy where I feel much more comfortable.	2004-04-10

And I thank my determination.  After this book I tripled my money.<br />If you have played in the casino, you can skip the first chapter.  If you are new to casino play, read chapter one.  It is accurate and will help ease you into this new setting.  The second chapter is the meat of this book.  It will no make you a world class stud player, but if you follow the simple strategies and starting hands you will be a money maker.<br />The remainder of the book goes into more advanced concepts and I found that in the lower limit games that most players start in, these advanced concepts-deception, bluffing, and reading-are not as useful as portrayed in this book.  As you continue your development, these concepts will be more useful.	2004-04-04

It contains a section discussing the different types of games that you might run into.  The examples and simple suggestions on how different styles affect the game are great for the new player.<br />The best part of the book is the tables that give you the correct pot odds for your bet.  They are great to commit to memory until you can calculate the odds yourself.  I found that expected value and calculating pot odds are important in lower limit games and having these tables helps your stack from shrinking.	2004-03-16

First, I do not read many mysteries.  I ended up stopping part way through the book to pick up another novel.  I was also expecting different use of more familiar characters.<br />The first 100 pages were used to develop the characters, the setting, and the motives of the multiple suspects.  Once I pushed past my personal preconceived ideas of this book, I was able to enjoy the mystery much better.  The mystery developed very well and the reveal satisfied me.  All the clues were well placed through out the story and easy to bring to conclusion.<br />The story was good but the writing seemed simple.  I think the need to develop the large ensemble of characters forced the writers to use stereotypes for many of players and a few even seem to be over used.  The story telling required for this story was excellent and I think that alone allowed me to drive through to the end.	2004-03-09

A book that provides help in converting a good ring game player into a good tournament almost sounds too good to be true.  I thought that at first, but my personal disappointment in my first hold'em tournament sent me running for help.<br />This book cannot work miracles so you need to be a good player before becoming a good tournament player.  Reading this book you will learn one of the most powerful tournament principles-The Gap Theory-and learn how to apply it.  The last third of the book are quizzes that discuss possible situations that arise during play.<br />One concept that is very important to understand is there are times you fold a great hand in tournament play.  Once you can throw them away, you will be better off.  My first tournament, I left in the second round.  Two weeks later and this book, I finished second out of fifty.

Written by the best in their field-or game-they help give beginners a full view of the game.<br />This is a great book for the player new to the game who feels they want to take the first steps to developing their game.

Most of the concepts are universal but there is a difference in some strategies between the games.<br />If you are serious about advancing your poker skills pick up this book.  I feel that it is the best bang for the buck.<br />On a different note, I am a Hold'em player.  This book is good for learning the basics of both Limit and No-Limit.

Setting:  This novel is placed before the movie Star Trek Nemisis, before many events in the movie have even completely come together.<br />Now I can spoil a minor surprise for everyone because it is reveled in the first four pages-Wesley Crusher stops by.  He watches from the sidelines through most of the novel and observes.  You are very aware of who he is and I personal felt a little cheated.  See, he was in the novel but never directly interacted with the other Enterprise characters until the very end.  I think it would have been more striking not to know who he was until the revel to the characters.<br />There is no doubt, where things go through out this novel but they are done very well and I was still driven to get to the end and see if my intuition was correct.<br />I can tell you for sure that I will be waiting each month for the next part of this series to show up.	2004-02-11

There were various twist and turns I did not expect and the interaction of multiple characters from various show/books helped reduce some of the complexity.<br />There are many jumps from one point of view to another and at times, this is very distracting.  There are often times where two characters are talk and the audience needs to know about a specific event.  Well it just happens that we had a few other characters involved in that event and it happened a few minutes ago.  Therefore, we jump back to that event and only that one event, then right back to the other current scene.<br />All the point of view changes, moving forward and backwards through the timeline of the story, provide the most complexity.  Only a single major character was created for this story, a young innocent Romulan.  The remainder of the cast is from familiar shows and books and not a lot of development was put into them.<br />The epilogue, the last twelve pages, drove this book up a full rating in my opinion.  Favorite characters are shoved forward into the lives we know they will lead and we get to see one of my favorite minor characters.	2004-02-06

I have read this book from cover to cover, taking the time to study the examples.  It is full of information and needs to be studied so it sits next to my bed and I review a section every night.<br />I am a Texas Hold'em player but this book covers most casino poker games.  Most tells are universal to all games unfortunately the presentation in this book moves through the different games.

It was not a terrible novel and I recommend that Star Trek fans-Riker fans in particular-take the time to get through this book.<br />Why I was disappointed was that I knew the end.  Most of the novel is split between Will Riker and his struggle from the Academy and his father running from his problems with Starfleet and his past.  I waited the whole novel to see if they would come together and see them clash.  They never did.<br />One of the other problems was that Jeff Mariotte seemed to work too hard to get cameos from other characters.  It seemed contrived that all these people seem to constantly cross paths even in these minimal ways.  I do not object to reading and seeing how great characters like Sisko and Janeway grew to who they were but adding them in just to say you used them is a little tactless.<br />This was a terribly tough review to write.  I did not want to sound too critical but still be accurate and honest.	2004-01-22

A. DeCandido has been developing this crew and the characters over a few a few books and stories and I am excited that they have been pulled from the tight ties of the Federation and sent out to conquer their own destinies.<br />This is the first of a two part series and I stand up and applaud the master talent applied to making this story its own work by itself.  We get to see characters introduced in various small screen series developed into stars in their own right.  This is some of the best writing I have experienced in a long time.<br />Take the time and attack this novel, you will love it.	2004-01-08
US	36332809	R117XKTNIKJXH2	0743463757	386633957	Well of Souls	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A good start	For a first novel, this was a good story and a great start to a blooming career.  Unfortunately, I fought my way through the book often finding other things to do rather the read.<br />I truly enjoyed the creative use of internal dialog of the point of view character.  Seeing these similar discussions that I often have with myself, immediately brought me into the characters.  I was distracted since each character was written in a different style.<br />The story felt labored.  The prologue was not tied to until very late, and every sub-plot came together perfectly, almost too perfectly.  It would have been better to see some be resolved at different times rather then all at once.<br />I loved the story and the idea.  I have to recommend the book.  It was good, but not perfect.  I am looking forward to other novels by Ilsa Bick.	2003-12-31

For the devoted reads of New Frontier, Peter David continues the adventures of Captain Calhoun and the Excalibur in their conflict with the supernatural `beings' claiming to be the gods of Earth's ancient cultures.<br />New readers might be a little lost starting with this book but it is possible to jump in without loosing much.  Peter David does a great job of bringing a user up to speed and then dive into the meat of the story.  This is a great story multiple characters in totally different settings and as with every other story Peter David does, the transitions are very graceful and with extreme skills.<br />I personally believed David felt that some of his characters need a little shaking up and made some dramatic changes, providing him and his characters new avenues and directions for development.  I look forward to continuing adventures in the New Frontier.	2003-11-28

Perry sucked me into Star Trek novels with her two-part re-launch of Deep Space Nine.  Since then I waited for new stories every month.  Over a year ago, I came across the advertisement for Unity and have been pulling my hair waiting for its release. <br />I loved this book and have to recommend it to everyone.  Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed with the ending.  Don't misunderstand, the ending was faithful to the DS9 but it brought to full realization, that the novels are the final medium for extending the characters.<br />Unity is great novel.  A wonderful adventure that closes the circle started in Avatar.	2003-11-17

DeCandido dives into the enormous task of telling the missing parts of not just the Klingon but Cardassian history.  This novel ties together the most loose ends I have seen in a single integrated tale but does it with such style and technique they simply flow with the story, unobtrusively.<br />I struggle to compose a review that does justice to this masterpiece.  It would be so easy to summarize the story, that part just screams to come out on the paper, but I cannot spoil it for any one.  Enjoy the ensemble cast that DeCandido brings together and trust that every character remains true to themselves.<br />A Star Trek fan has to venture into this story.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-11-12

I enjoyed this book because it reminds me of many plots in Deep Space 9. It shows a Federation that is not perfect.  A Starfleet willing to deceive.  A captain willing to take big risks.<br />This novel and I fought from the first page.  The first 120 pages were slow and a struggle to read.  I even put the book down twice to pick up another one.  Finally pushing through the initial introduction, I spent the next two nights hunting for time to finish the adventure.<br />This is a novel readers are going to hate or are going to love.  Its plot pushes the world of Star Trek into questionable actions and develops characters that stretch beyond the pages of the book.  The part of me that trust the \\"goodness\\" of the Federation struggled with this book but the part of me understands the world is full of grays and not just black and white enjoyed the it.<br />This was a novel about characters.  The good and the bad of the characters.  The moral and duty of the characters.  The internal turmoil of the characters.  Even in the end, the resolution felt almost contrived but absolutely honest to the characters themselves.	2003-10-28

Short stories have always been a personal favorite and I jumped into this book with glee.  I was excited when I glanced at the cover and saw a new story from Andrew J. Robinson about the continuing adventures of our favorite simple tailor, Garak.<br />I enjoy Garak and the love what Robinson does to continue the character but I was slightly disappointed with this tale.  The writing exceptional I have grown to expect from this multi-talented individual but I felt the gap in the story.  Robinson's story, \\"The Calling,\\" continues after his novel \\"A Stitch in Time\\" and a stage play \\"The Dream Box.\\"  I search to find the manuscript but failed and the breach in the story line jumped out.<br />The first story showed the initial step of Kira accepting Sisko as the Emissary, a powerful story and considering the quality of all the stories the best in the collection.  Marco Palmieri complied a terrific collection of tales from both amateur authors and seasons professionals.<br />If you are a Deep Space Nine fan, take the time to pick up this anthology, you will not be disappointed.	2003-10-19

Captain Sulu and the USS Excelsior depart on a diplomatic mission to work with an older foe, the Thorians.  With the help of many colleagues from the original Enterprise, the crew is able to stop a war between the Federation and the Thorians.<br />The volume of tie-in presented in the book excited me.  Every time a chapter started, I sat on edge waiting to see how the authors would bring another aspect of the Star Trek universe in.  As the third novel I have read from these writers, I can say each time I am elated with the complexity they provoke in the familiar characters.<br />With no reservations, I give this book the highest rating.  As a novel it defiantly deserves it but I question the background presented about the Thorians.  I fell there might be descripencies with the minimal use of the Thorians in the current TV series.

Diane Carey continues on with this incredible adaptation of the Deep Space Nine episodes.  This final book in The Dominion War series leaves me waiting for the re-runs to start-up.<br />I enjoyed this freshly re-told tale, including the introduction of new characters.  The brief mention of one of Sisko's friends-Charlie Reynolds-allowed Carey to develop a ship and crew I fell in love with.  The final weaving of their story left me touched.  I felt involved with a new friend and sad to see it end.<br />Diane Carey always provides me with a surprise, every time I grab up a Star Trek novel by her.  Most times I expect to be disappointed by a new cast of characters, but by the final page, I always wish I had more time with them.  She provides me with the most mixed emotions and jumbled feels.  It is always a pleasure to read her magic.<br />This is the final book in the four part series.  I searched for all four of these books together so I would not be lost.  Many times I could find the pairing:  both DS9 or both TNG, but felt that I needed them all together.  I was wrong.  Although marketed as a single series, it was simply two, two-part series, with no tie-ins between them.  As independent story, take the time to enjoy them.	2003-08-14

I felt the conclusion of this tale was very good, but the editing was terrible.  A variety of times during the Riker subplot, the female repair officer seemed to change ranks a few times, between Commander (pg30) and Captain (pg22).  Once I realized the simple error, overlooking it because easy.  But I digress...<br />The main tale of adventure weaved by Vornholt caught my attention and kept me pushing to finish the story.  The sub-plots felt contrived.  Data charging to the rescue and the Enterprise being in the right spot at the right time, felt wrong.  The story was great but the execution just was not there.<br />I loved the tale and story.  Would I read more from John Vornholt?  I am not sure.  As a Star Trek fan, I can forgive the minor problems in this novel.  I even understand the pressure deadlines can cause on good stories.  No one is perfect, so I am sure I will dive into more novels.<br />Ro Laren character comments:<br />S.D. Perry re-introduced Ro into the Deep Space Nine novel re-launch.  The development of her in this story did not interfere with the character in Avatar.  There is a minor mention in Avatar about Picard protecting Ro from Starfleet, which no seems kind of awkard but doesn't interfere.	2003-08-11

Diane Carey's novelization of these Deep Space Nine episodes holds to the same standards.  We get to see into the minds of the characters and understand the choices they made on screen.  We get to see specific outcomes of events never fully disclosed during the series.<br />There were a few new characters introduced but the development of the regular cast was great.  Captain Sisko's development and the insight into his choices I felt were completely in character.  General Martok showed new depth into his character but having read the two part series by J. Hertzler, am not sure of some of this character's actions.<br />Overall, a wonderful read and I enjoyed pushing through it quickly.  As a four part series, I was hoping for some interaction and cross over with the first book.  From what I have read so far, I see two, two-book series, rather then an interconnected four part I was hoping for.	2003-08-07

As one of the first novels by John Vornholt, I really enjoyed the start of this adventure.  This is the first review I will write after completing this book, but will come back and revise it after I have completed the series.<br />I was overjoyed to see the return of some of my favorite minor characters.  The return of Sam Lavelle and Taurik from the Next Generation Episode \\"Lower Decks\\" as prisoners of war fighting for their lives and their freedom.  We also see Ro Laren return to the Federation to continue on with the good fight.<br />The development of Data and Riker in this novel showed unexpected twists and turns.  The loneliness of duty and the personal losses people suffer during tragic times played a wonderful but somber reprieve from the action filled development of Picard and Ro.<br />Going back after the completion of the Next Generation movies, the finale of Deep Space Nine, and the re-launch of the Deep Space Nine novels, I question where the development of characters should be.  The expansion of the Ro character in this story arc has been well done but I reserve how well the transition from the end of this arc to the beginning of Avatar by S.D. Perry.  To read my final say on the matter, jump over to the review of the final novel in this arc.	2003-08-03

Unfortunately the prose did not stand up to the same expectations. The idea of an interstellar war carried out at sub-light speeds creates a lot of possible twists and turns. At the halfway point of the story, I knew the out come and solutions. No surprises.<br />The characters seemed flat, even the reoccurring ones. The plot showed no real motion. There seemed to be no action. As a novel about first contact, I felt S.P. Somtow never watched the episode focused on first contract. Picard and his crew interfered into a culture that never developed on their own.<br />I was truly disappointed in this walk around the park.	2003-07-08

It pushed through the very contrived story that I felt left fans unsatisfied with the direction the characters were taking.<br />On a different note, the Borg conflict story that ran the length of the two books was a very creative story.  It was took a question and let it run its course.  I do have to question the idea of the Borg virus.  The First Contact movie introduced the Borg Queen but a later episode of Voyager presented the queen asking Seven to create the virus, a simple problem with continuity pulling from the enjoyment of the novel.<br />In true Star Trek fashion, the Voyager crew saves the day and Earth itself.  The hologram revolution still lingers and foreshadows issues in the continuing story.  More adventures for the crew are definitely forthcoming but what you are never quite sure.<br />The end of the book put the senior staff back to work and other then Tuvok they felt forced and out of character.  I do like meeting the new captain of Voyager in the closing pages.	2003-06-27

The pain he carries stirs his temper, distancing him from his friend, family and loved ones.  The perfect world a sheltered Harry dreamed of begins to fall apart as the once black and white layers are pealed away to show the world a confusing shade of gray.<br />Harry is forced to endear another lost to learn the powerful lesson that he is fallible.  Even the heroic and noble Harry Potter is with out making mistakes.  During the telling of this story Harry also learns that everyone--Sirius, Snape, and even Dumbledore-do not always have the correct answers.<br />This is a darker book with sharper corners to catch the reader on as Harry struggles with his inner daemons and his external foes.	2003-06-22

This novel makes an attempt to answer those questions but unfortunately the answers were difficult to swallow.<br />The enormous task of relaunching the Star Trek Voyager I do not envy but as a fan I felt robbed by the direction.  As an inspiring writer I understand action and suspense sells novels and Homecoming does exactly that.  Golden throws the crew directly in harms way but sacrifices the answers to the question.<br />All of the questions were answered too quickly.  Seven years of questions and problems and dreams, resolved in the first few chapters, I felt disappointed.  Everything with the homecoming of the crew seemed perfect.  The conflict of the story was new and external.  It had nothing to do with the crew and their families and the return home.<br />Once I accepted that the resolutions I wanted to see were not going to happen, I was able to delve into the novel and accept the story.  As a fan I will continue to follow the characters I loved on the little screen and see how their lives develop at home.	2003-06-09
