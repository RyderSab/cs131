This is a great collection of letters that will give great insight to Henry Miller's fans. The letters follow this tumultuous relationship &amp; show Henry Miller at his most childish and pathetic. Hoki was a scam artist  extraordinaire &amp; Henry went along for the ride, while paying for the  car, the insurance, gas, food along the way, etc. This is a must read for  any Henry Miller fan. Others will find it kind of pointlessly pitiful.	1999-09-21

The novel is not very well written, filled with pedantic, prolix and  baroque passages, as Miller struggles mightily to find his voice. Miller  fans will find this work quite interesting, as it is another variation on  The Rosy Crucifixion. However, this book is definately not a good place to  start your journey through the works of Henry Miller, as there are many  better places to begin (Tropic of Cancer, Air Conditioned Nightmare) your  journey.	1999-09-08

McTeague is one of the greatest works of &quot;classic American literature&quot; I have ever read. Frank Norris was a genius at being able to size up the inhumanity of humanity &amp; roll it all up in one great big  nasty ball of literature that packs a punch that will knock you on your  bum! McTeague is an uncaring brute who knows not the chaos that he creates.  His wife is a gullible victim with a heart of gold. His best friend is  ready to steal away his most prized posession. To top it all off is an  ending for the ages that will leave one of the most stark, naked pictures  presented in all of literature's annals. Many people will not enjoy  McTeague because of the sheer brutality &amp; the negative, crushing tone  of the novel. For those of you who don't need rainbows &amp; unicorns in a  novel, I have a feeling you'll be absolutely thrilled by this American  masterpiece.	1999-09-01

Brenda made Henry's last days marvelous ones, even though his  health was failing.

While being another semi-autobiographical romance, it lacks the deep introspection, commentaries on art &amp; literature and the constant &quot;I am an artist,  I am an artist. I am! I am! I am!&quot; so often found in these type of  Miller works, which makes this short volume so refreshing and enjoyable.  It's mostly about sex, food &amp; fun in Miller's Paris days while living  with good buddy Alfred &quot;Joey&quot; Perles. It is erotic &amp;  stimulating without being pornographic or &quot;filthy&quot;. It's more  akin to mind candy than food for thought, which is A-OK with me. A very  enjoyable, entertaining read.	1999-08-31

Since there are already some long reviews of this book, I will just make one specific comment. On reading about the book, a person could get the idea that these are poems for Jews &amp; Jews alone. The publisher leads  one to think that. However, even though the poems are thoroughly Jewish,  they can be enjoyed by people of any religious background, including  athiests such as myself. Marge Piercy transends the genre her publisher  tries to confine her in, being a brilliant poet of incredible depth &amp;  talent.	1999-08-31

I disagree. While in-depth, many facts listed are incorrect because of a lack of checking (although many checkers were  used) with factual records. Dearborne's biggest angle seems to be to show  that Miller was always a closet homosexual &amp; June was a lesbian junkie.

The poems are loaded with pedantic desriptions &amp; back-patting about how intelligent Mlinko herself is. It looks to me like  she went to the Jean Kronski School Of Poetry, stringing together  adjectives &amp; nouns trying to strike a wandering-spirit chord in her  readers (I'm assuming she has &quot;borrowed&quot; her intent from Henry  Miller's comments about how his prose takes one to special places in the  mind, far away from the text of the book) which just falls flat. It comes  off like a young college grad showing off all the big words she's picked up  along the way. Hopefully, Mlinko will drop the posing, back-patting &amp;  aiming for a subjective esoteric response akin to her own impressions of  her work from her readers.	1999-08-31

While some opinions are based in reality, others are just plain wrong  subjective conclusions. Aside from the subject matter, the flow of the  poems and prose are hit &amp; miss. Some do have a great rhythm &amp; flow,  while others just come off as a ripoff of Rabelasian lists and Celineian  thought fragments. Instead of getting this non-black reader to understand  her situation &amp; sympathize with it, I instead found myself saying  &quot;Did you ever think you have so many problems with white people  because you have so much hatred and annimosity towards them?&quot; There's  definately some &quot;pot calling the kettle black&quot; shenannigans going  on here.	1999-08-31

I read this book because several people with normally very compatible tastes in books with me recommended it. However, after reading this work, I just don't get the huge depth most other readers seem to find in this work.  It just seems to me like another detached non-romantical romance that isn't  very masterfully written. While the book is very non-assuming &amp; direct,  it lacks the substance its reputation carries. Want to read an &quot;Ask  The Dust&quot; that's in your face &amp; is a literary masterpiece, try  Frank Norris' novel McTeague. Even though I seem to be the only person I  know that doesn't really love this book, I don't think my opinion is off.  This book doesn't &quot;do&quot; what it's &quot;supposed&quot; to do to  me.

Robert Ferguson has written a spectacular biography on legendary writer Henry Miller. Ferguson, unlike other Miller biographers (such as Mary Dearborne, Alfred Perles), relates the details of Miller's life &amp; works  without personal bias or an angle. Although a very tough task, Ferguson is  able to distinguish reality as it happened from reality as reported by  Henry Miller (which at times is filled with bald-faced lies, such as  claiming to have met Emma Goldman although she was not allowed in the city  when Miller claims to have met her) most of the time. While some fans of  Miller will not like the work because it &quot;spoils the mystique of a  legend&quot;, others will, I'm sure, agree that this is a thorough, fair  and accurate biography about a man who tried very hard to erase the tracks  he made in life with all new marks created by semi-autobiographical  romances.

The  tale is told at a brisk pace and is filled with many colourful, vivid  descriptions of people, places &amp; things.

Miller vehemently denied ever writing the book, but it's author  couldn't shake this monkey off his back even from the grave. It is  incredibly difficult to read, filled with sensational sexual acts and not  much else. If you want to read everything Henry Miller ever wrote, or if  you enjoy reading pornography, okay.

Have you ever wanted to sit down with one of your favorite authors and gab about books? While most of us can't do this, fans of Henry Miller do have this innovative work as a substitute. In it, Miller lists his favorite  authors &amp; books, then expounds on various authors, subjects &amp;  points in his reading life. Blaise Cendrars, Jean Giono, Krishnamurti,  reading while in the john &amp; more get their own chapters. Miller wanted  to write more editions, including a list of over 50,000 titles he has read,  but never got the chance to do so. That's okay. I'm very grateful for  having this work available!	1999-08-27
