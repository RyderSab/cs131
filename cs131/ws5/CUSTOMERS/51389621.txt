It might have been better to read the book first, but I lucked out in that there was nothing really wrong with my kit (All-Glass kit with Tetra components).  I like the For Dummies books, and looked through the Dummies book, but this one got me with its colorful photos, but is written in very much the same style as Dummies: Cartoons beginning the chapters, call-outs in the margins, friendly writing style, etc.<br /><br />If you're a raw beginner with aquaria, I don't know what you could need that this book doesn't cover.  I think the most valuable unique feature is the last chapter which includes a dozen or so expertly predesigned stocking schemes.  Compatible fish are chosen, and the numbers given for your size tank (29- or 50- gallon) to ensure success.  We are following the Asian biotope with White Clouds, Rasboras, Gold Barbs and Dwarf Gouramis.<br /><br />Probably the most annoying thing about the book is that the photos of the fish are scattered throughout the book.  It is nice in that while you are reading on more mundane topics, there's a fish photo to remind you of your results.  I can see the advantage of this, but when you want to see what a Dwarf Gourami looks like, you have to search through the book.  The index lists the fish, but does not reference the photographs!  A separate index of the photos would be nice, or, at the minimum, list the photos in the regular index.<br /><br />The author strongly suggests a 50- or 55-gallon tank to begin with.  This is not a bad recommendation.  But he realizes that that's not practical for all households.  A 29 gallon is his second choice.  The things he preaches are regular water changes, no overfeeding and not overpopulating the tank.<br /><br />Mr. Boruchowitz suggests placing the tank near a floor drain and where a hose easily reaches.  I suspect that this is not possible for most people who want an aquarium, like us, to add ambience to your living area.  To meet his suggestions, we'd be putting the tank outside on the patio or on the bathroom sink!  Therein lies the main disadvantage of a larger tank - water changes need to be done with buckets.<br /><br />Although he does tell you the correct pronunciation of \\"cichlid,\\" I wish he had discussed other pronunciations so you don't feel like a fool in the fish store. (Gouramis: Gore-A-meez or GORE-a-miss?).  A half page on Latin pronunciation would have been a cool addition.<br /><br />There seems to be a wide range of recommendations on what to do while cycling the tank.  Some experts recommend 10-15% weekly water changes while cycling or not.  They argue that letting the ammonia level rise encourages the development of the nitrifying bacteria (this is a good thing - we're trying to do this) and there is little unusual you need to do.  At the other end of the spectrum are those who do large and frequent water water changes while cycling to keep the ammonia levels down for the benefit of the fish, and argue that the bacteria will develop fine regardless.  Mr. Boruchowitz falls very much in the latter camp, also encouraging frequent water testing while cycling.  I guess my point is to be aware that there's a range of opinions on this topic, and you may find that you can be sucessful with less work than presented.  (My expert aquarist coworker told me to not bother testing and don't do anything heroic with water changes.)<br /><br />Other reviewers complained that the author did not focus much on the fish.  There are 1000-plus-page books on freshwater aquarium fish, and I believe that this is outside the scope of this book.  There is enough discussion of fish to make you avoid problems, and if you follow the suggested stocking schemes, you should be successful.  This book is addressed to beginners.  Once you're successful with a scheme in this book, you can spend a lifetime researching other fish to keep.<br /><br />This book also explodesmany misconceptions, like that fish only grow to fit the size of the tank, (They grow until the tank is too small to support them, and they die!) and that you must have an algae eater in the tank (the problem is that people use an algae-eater as an excuse to omit proper maintenance, or don't consider its load on the tank).<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to someone starting with an aquarium for the first time (and would suggest getting the book first, but when we decided to get an aquarium, we were too excited not to buy the whole outfit!).  I only did not give it five stars because there's room for improvement, especially in indexing the fish photos.k also explodes many misconceptions, like that fish only grow to fit the size of the tank, (They grow until the tank is too small to support them, and they die!) and that you must have an algae eater in the tank (the problem is that people use an algae-eater as an excuse to omit proper maintenance, or don't consider its load on the tank). <br /> <br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to someone starting with an aquarium for the first time (and would suggest getting the book first, but when we decided to get an aquarium, we were too excited not to buy the whole outfit!).

I gave the book a good review, but since reading Reinhart's AMERICAN PIE, I have to say, unless you just don't have the extra money for this book, skip THE ART and get AMERICAN PIE.  You may find that AMERICAN PIE is the only pizza book you need.<br /><br />Comparisons against THE ART are difficult for me to avoid.  DeAngelis basically instructs on making one style of pizza - what Reinhart would call a New York style or Americana.  Reinhart teaches you to make Napoletana pizza, New York style pizza, Americana pizza, Roman style (thin crust) pizza, grilled pizza (Yes!  It's what it sounds like!), Chicago deep dish pizza and a few breads that you may not consider pizza at all, like pita, carta di musica and focaccia.  DeAngelis INSISTS that you need to use high-gluten flour (good luck finding it locally) and complains of the inadequacy of the home oven.  Reinhart uses (mostly) available ingredients and writes the book knowing that it's going to be used within the limitations of a home kitchen.<br /><br />But until recently, I've had problems with the recipes.  I've tried the Napoletana crust, the Americana crust, the focaccia, the carta di musica, and the prebaked crusts.  Despite following his recipes (nearly) to a \\"T,\\" the dough just did not act as described in the book.  It was not as elastic as described, and could tear apart from its own weight.  Despite this, if I could get the dough formed into a crust at all, the results were still pretty good!  There are two pages on \\"Ten Tips for Making Pizza Dough.\\"  These may be the two most valuable pages in the book, and should be expanded and not relegated to the reduced type size. The recipes call for \\"instant yeast.\\"  I've never found anything in the store called \\"instant yeast.\\"  The ten tips include substitutions for active dry, which I could find everywhere.  I tried the following these instructions with no improvement.  I had to research \\"instant yeast.\\"  With help from Alton Brown's I'M JUST HERE FOR MORE FOOD and other sources, I discovered that the stuff in the store called \\"yeast for bread machines\\" was in fact, instant yeast.  Reinhart should discuss this more.  Differences in yeasts may seem common knowledge for someone as himself, who is, by all accounts, one of the nation's leading experts on baking, but can confuse the home baker to whom the book is directed.<br /><br />I finally discovered my problem, again, with help from Alton Brown while watching his bread episode of GOOD EATS where he used the same Kitchenaid mixer as I and momentarily ran the mixer to high to spread the dough when it wrapped around the dough hook.  I was dutifully following Reinhart's instructions to knead on medium-low, and my Kitchenaid Artisan really needs medium, if not a bit more to knead.  The problem was exacerbated by the fact that I tried to half the recipes (most make a half dozen 12\\" crusts) and the dough just spun around on the hook for a ride, not kneading at all.  Once I corrected this other day, I got the most incredible New York style pizza out of my very oven that would compete with any I've ever had from a pizzeria.  Oh - and be warned, depending on the size of your garlic cloves, you might find his sauces to be pretty garlicky.<br /><br />Of the many doughs, my wife actually liked the prebaked freezer crusts the best.  I don't think Reinhart intended this and offers the recipe as an alternative to the popular par-baked crusts in the supermarket.  They are great to have on hand when you want a pizza, but could not plan ahead to defrost a dough before you left for work in the morning.<br /><br />The first third of the book is the author's travels around the world studying the art and types of pizza.  He waxes quite philosophical.  I expected that this wouldn't appeal to me, but it ended up drawing me in, and I stayed up late finishing the section.  He dispels some popular myths.Pizza is NOT traditionally made by spinning it in the air, and it was not invented in America.<br /><br />My brother's copy of AMERICAN PIE also had the artsy, rough-cut pages, so we think that's normal.<br /><br />Again, this is the only book on pizza you'll probably ever need.  My only suggestions are to add more \\"diagnostics\\" should you have problems.  Although I usually eschew the idea that a cookbook need glitzy color photos, a few black and white showing, for example, what a focaccia is supposed to look like, would be very helpful.  (Some of us have lived sheltered lives!)  I am still trying to find my personal holy grail, though: the Pizza Hut thin crust!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting Reinhart's BREAD BAKER'S APPRENTICE.

US	51389621	R3QIGMRMHUKIU3	0785262210	514110883	Guns, Freedom, and Terrorism	Books	4	12	15	N	N	A single up-to-date compilation of facts and logic	Wayne LaPierre is eminently qualified to logically and clearly present the irrefutable facts exposing the total ineffectiveness and grave danger of gun control.  There may be other recent books as good as this one, but I haven't seen them yet.  GUNS, FREEDOM AND TERRORISM is a single source of the most recent truth and data about the effects of gun control and incidents surrounding it.  Most of the relevant data is boiled down here and presented in an easily-understood manner.<br /><br />It is important that a book on gun control be regularly updated with the latest data.  This book does that, discussing terrorism, the war in Iraq, the latest results of right-to-carry laws, Michael Bellesiles, arming pilots, the dismal failure of gun confiscation in Australia and the United Kingdon, and the problems of ballistic \\"fingerprinting.\\"<br /><br />Although the title might lead on to believe that this book is mostly about terrorism, terrorism is the main topic for only two or three chapters.  A logical person might wonder how those who fear an armed citizenry could twist the terrorist attacks of 9/11 to promote anything but the further need of Americans to be able to defend themselves and their country.  But they do, in their usual illogical manner.  LaPierre discusses how the Brady bunch, et. al., believe that well-funded international terrorists are arming themselves at local gun shows, and points out the absurdity of their claims.<br /><br />I have few and minor criticisms of this book.  At first, reading the book from cover to cover, I often thought, \\"He's repeating that from a previous chapter.\\"  I then realized that the intent was probably to make each chapter stand alone.  One can use this book as reference, looking up a particular topic, and just read the chapter on that topic.  (Although I'd recommend reading the whole thing.)  So this initially-perceived fault becomes an advantage.  On some topics, I believe that Mr. LaPierre fails to define some terms that are known to someone who is familiar with the topic of gun control, but probably not to someone who is using this book to research the topic for the first time.  One example is the \\"gun show loophole.\\"  I know what it is, but felt that he didn't define it well for the less knowledgable reader.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that these terms created by the freedom opponents are purposely designed to obfuscate what the term is describing.  A person capable of critical thought would not consider the \\"gun show loophole\\" a loophole at all.<br /><br />I also felt that the chapter on the Second Amendment quoted more of the founding fathers.  Their intent was made very clear in the records from their time.<br /><br />One can read books like Lott's MORE GUNS, LESS CRIME with all of the statistical gory details.  This engineering Ph.D. with a math minor gets bogged down in reading it.  Or you can read GUNS, FREEDOM AND TERRORISM and have all the results from Lott, Kleck, DOJ, etc. boiled down in one place.<br /><br />I strongly believe that EVERY American should be familiar with the Second Amendment, its purpose, and what the intent of the founding fathers was.  If all people realized the consequences of losing this freedom, they would all fight tooth and nail against the forces that wish to steal their freedoms.  This is an excellent, coherent, easily-read book that would provide this basis.are known to someone who is familiar with the topic of gun control, but probably not to someone who is using this book to research the topic for the first time.

How interesting can a book on kitchen implements be?  I have always loved kitchen gadgets and machines, and although I'm the one who drags my wife through the kitchenware sections of stores, I still asked this question about this book.  Well, it is a very interesting book, and I wish I had read this before buying most of what's in my kitchen.<br /><br />Alton Brown is the host of the Food Network show GOOD EATS.  The show was first brought to my attention by a local radio morning show DJ.  Alton is a sort of combination of Julia Childs and Mr. Wizard with a little wackiness of Jeff Corwin thrown in.  After quickly getting addicted to the show, I wondered if Alton had any books, and my search led me to GEAR FOR YOUR KITCHEN.<br /><br />In the short time I've been watching the show, he's twice lifted his fire extinguisher and said, \\"This is the only unitasker in my kitchen.\\"  That philosophy permeates this book.  You will also find that he will often use non-kitchen tools if he feels they perform the task better.  He serves pie with a masonry trowel and scapes dough with a drywall taping knife.<br /><br />He's not afraid to name names, which is extremely beneficial and not often seen in books (Don't want to upset potential advertisers!).  So instead of just describing what to look for in an item, he tells you what item(s) meets those requirements.  Of course, this risks making the book quickly dated.  He is also not afraid to say what items he's abandoned when they were poorly \\"updated,\\" such as now recommending the Kitchenaid food processor over his once-favorite Cuisinart because Cuisinart changed the toggle switch to a membrane switch.  Hopefully, some of the revelation will guide the manufacturers to provide better products.<br /><br />The book is very easy to read, and reads like listening to the author on his show.  The layout is very attractive.  The book is punctuated with interesting sidebars giving historical information on the materials and products. There are actually a handful of recipes using the tools described in that section.  For example, the section on food processors includes a recipe for Hummus.  The book is full of photos of recommended items.  There is a several-page table on cooking utensil materials: what they are, what they're good for, and what they're not.  Some of these sidebars and tables are very appealing to an engineer like me (Alton Brown, in general, probably appeals to engineers like me), but may be boring to others.  You can skip many of them without much damage.<br /><br />Chapters are Pots and Pans, Sharp Things (knives and slicers), Small Things with Plugs (electric countertop kitchen appliances), Kitchen Tools Unplugged (pretty much any tool that doesn't fall into the other categories), Storage and Containment, and a potentially ho-hum chapter on Safety and Sanitation, which wasn't so bad.  I could probably benefit from this last chapter, although (famous last words) I've never gotten sick from anything I made in my kitchen.  It's harder explaining to my wife why I'm buying spray bottles and squeegees.<br /><br />I can offer a few suggestions for improvements.  Mainly, additional illustrations are needed to help describe differences in some items.  He could use diagrams to describe different kinds of pots and pans, different turners and spatulas, and the different whisks.  He does this very thing describing different kinds of knives and the parts of the knives, but falls down on the job in the other sections.  There are text descriptions like \\"straight sides,\\" \\"curved sides,\\" \\"flared sides,\\" \\"sides that curve outward,\\" \\"they all have an offset angle built into them either at the tip or in the handle,\\" and others.  It can be hard to conceive in your mind (or maybe it's really simple, and I'm just messed up because I'm an engineer and he's not describing what plane he's working in, what line he's referring the angle to, etc.)  By \\"straight sides\\" does he mean \\"vertical?\\"<br /><br />And p. 192 confuses me.  Alton insists there is a difference between turners and spatulas, but under \\"Wide, Solid Turner,\\" he describes a particular product he owns, and there is a photo of it with a caption that clearly describes it as the same item, but calls it a \\"spatula.\\"  Furthermore, the next section, \\"Cake Spatulas,\\" the first describing spatulas, refers to \\"the spatula described above.\\"  Ugh.  Which is it?  Are spatulas and turners the same or not?<br /><br />OK.  Minor point.<br /><br />Mr. Brown does concedes that there may be a few good unitaskers, and admits to owning a few, but only if they do a job you need a done a lot, and it does it very well.  Oh...and he does discuss fire extinguishers.<br /><br />I don't think I'll personally purchase this book since it is in the my local library, and it's not something I think I'll have to refer to frequently.  However, if you don't have access to it, or want to keep it around for the recipes (or have an unlimited book budget and bookcase space), I'd highly recommend purchasing GEAR FOR YOUR KITCHEN.<br />And p. 192 confuses me.

I believe it was on the way to a Boy Scout camping trip when the troop stopped at a convenience store and one of my fellow scouts bought some of that weird-looking beef jerky stuff sold by the cash register.<br /><br /> Years later, in grad school, I realized I could make jerky in my apartment. I bought a cheap dehydrator and some mixes for making ground beef jerky, and had reasonable success with it, although I'm surprised I didn't get sick with jerky made on a machine with no temperature control and such uneven drying. It was kind of excruciating forming jerky without a jerky gun, and other things took my attention, and the dehydrator got put away.<br /><br /> Another six or seven years down the road, I'm in my career and my own house and the dehydrating bug hit again, encouraged by a desire to dry food for camping, but mostly still to make jerky. After inconsistent results with the old dehydrator, I got a good Gardenmaster (NESCO FD-1018 - my review is on Amazon), and picked up some ground beef jerky packets along with a jerky gun at Outdoor World in Orlando. I was back in the jerkey business, and it was good! However, I don't see the mixes in local stores, and Orlando is an hour drive each way, so I needed to make my own marinade. Would it work as well? I read reviews and finally bought JUST JERKY by Mary Bell.<br /><br /> This book is so very easily and quickly read, although it contains all you need to know. The introductory chapters discuss the history of drying meats, the equipment and procedures, and the physics and biology of making jerky, including discussions of the bacteria that can ruin your day. The book discusses smokers, how to select the right cuts of meat, and marinade ingredients. The author intersperses entertaining stories from her own life and those of people she knows.<br /><br /> Then the book gets into the recipes. There is a chapter on strip jerky (made from continuous strips of meat) which includes recipes for goat, venison, chicken as well as beef jerky (almost any kind of meat can be used with any recipe) Following that are chapters on fish jerky, ground meat jerky (formed into shapes and dried - I highly recommend a jerky gun for this), vegeterian jerky, and finally, a chapter on using jerky which includes recipes for jerky cake and jerky frosting! Really!<br /><br /> I actually read the book, and put it away for several months until the other day when my wife told me I could use the leftover, uncooked half of a roast. I decided to make Jordan's Rowdy Jerky since I had some leftover cheap Scotch from seasoning my bagpipes. Well, neither my wife nor I really cared for that one. Naturally, it tasted fermented, which means you couldn't really tell if it turned bad. I ate it anyway, because I like jerky. It just wouldn't be my first choice. (Or second. Or third.)<br /><br /> I was intrigued by reviews saying this book would show you how to make convincing vegetarian jerky. Now, I have no reason to make vegetarian jerky other than the challenge. (Really, if you're a vegetarian, why would you have a hankering for jerky?) The key ingredient is soy protein, to which the author adds certain ingredients for cohesion, texture and flavor. She recommends a brand called Hearty Natural, but says there are many brands. I don't exactly see a lot of this stuff, and what I found was Yves' Carb Fit Veggie Ground Round. I made the recipe for Tastes-Like-Meat jerky. First problem was extruding with the jerky gun. The soy protein was very lumpy. When it dried, there were individual lumps with material barely bridging to the other lumps. And lots of holes in between. When prying it off the trays, it cracked into small lumps. Now, maybe it'd work better with the Hearty Natural. Maybe I shouldn't have used the jerky gun to form it. But I wasn't impressed. It was crispy (although the author warns you that it dries crisp), and the taste was eh. Yeah. Eh. My wife said, &quot;Tastes like dried vegetables.&quot; Which it was. Can't pull anything over on her.<br /><br /> Lest you think I'm nothing but a failure, I decided to try some ground beef recipes, and I'd go out and BUY the ingredients needed. My wife said, &quot;Make some regular jerky.&quot; I explained that there is no &quot;regular&quot; jerky, but decided that the Soy Sauce Jerky and Teriyaki Jerky were probably closest to what you buy in the store. In short, they came out fabulously. Both were good, and similar to &quot;store jerky,&quot; but my wife decided that the teriyaki was &quot;regular&quot; jerky. So if you want something familiar, I'd start with that. I don't think it was as teriyaki-tasting as store-bought jerky labelled &quot;Teriyaki.&quot;<br /><br /> No more trips to Orlando to buy jerky mix. The ingredients are easy-to-find, and you can adjust these recipes to suit your taste. I think I counted 51 jerky recipes, so you can spend some time experimenting. And there are several other recipes for things to make with the jerky. I doubt I will use those personally, as I like jerky just for being jerky, but they're there for those who want them.<br /><br /> Each recipe has a little sidebar with a history of that particular recipe, or related story. One small complaint is that the recipes could give a little more detail, or be a little more consistent from one to the next. For example, one recipe gives more information on carmelizing onions, and another just says &quot;carmelize the onions.&quot; Unless you read the first, you might be asking &quot;what is 'carmelize?'&quot; And who reads a cookbook from beginning to end?<br /><br /> My only other complaint is the binding. It does not want to lie flat, and I think I'm about to lose a lot of pages out of it. But if you want to make jerky, you need this book, and it may be the only book you need.eh. Yeah. Eh.

There are three \\"Top Secret Recipes\\" books, Top Secret Recipes, More Top Secret Recipes (this book) and Even More Top Secret Recipes.  These books focus on what Wilbur calls \\"convenience foods.\\"  That is, most packaged sweets and fast food.  He also has a book Top Secret Restaurant Recipes, in which he attempts to duplicate the foods of mostly casual dining restaurants like Chili's and Applebee's.  He also has a book solely on drinks.<br /><br />Wilbur explains in the Introduction of More Top Secret Recipes that these are not the actual recipes used by restaurants, and he did not obtain them through bribery, theft other illegal or illicit means.  He starts with the ingredient list on packages of food and modifies the relative amounts, or with fast food, tries to identify the ingredients by taste.  He admits that the real producers of these foods often use custom ingredients unavailable to the consumer, and that the goal was to match the texture and flavor of the food, and appearance is secondary.<br /><br />So why try to clone commercially-available food?  In both More Top Secret Recipes and Even More Top Secret Recipes, the author mentions availability.  Some of the foods are regional, and you may not get them where you live.  In the introduction to More Top Secret Recipes, he gives a list of reasons including low cost and curiosity.  I'm not so sure about the cost argument, since I have to sacrifice two boxes of Macaroni and Cheese to make half a box of Cheese Nips, but the curiosity is what applied to me.  I just wanted to know, \\"Can I really duplicate these commercial foods at home?\\"<br /><br />This book contains 88 recipes, a big increase over the 37 of the previous book.  The recipes clone the likes of McDonald's, Nabisco, Carl's Jr. and Taco Bell.  Every recipe includes a history of the food item, something alone which makes this book valuable, and a dimensioned engineering graphic of the product.  Even More Top Secret Recipes includes an interesting introduction discussing the fast food industry, and gives some tips on creating the clones.  The recipes make as much use as possible of premade food and mixes.  For example, most candy bars are coated with melted chocolate chips, so you will not find that you have to crush cocoa beans, or perform any such low-level task.<br /><br />From this book, so far, I attempted to make Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies,  (I AM a Girl Scout after all.  Really.  My wife signed me up.  It was a surprise to me, too!) and Nabisco Cheese Nips.  The thin mints turned out pretty good.  The flavor and texture were pretty close.  The only problem is that the chocolate was a little thick.  Applying it to a desired thickness is difficult.  Also, the chocolate remained quite soft.  A little more experimentation with cookie thickness and baking time and temperature might make the centers a little more consistent, too.  The Cheese Nips are made using the cheese packets from Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (Cheese and Macaroni?).  They turned out crispy, and although bright orange like the real thing before baking, turned out grayish-tan when done.  Although crispy, they weren't light and bubbly like the real thing, but were more like crispy cookies.  They needed to be cheesier.  They tasted like the flour and shortening.  They weren't bad, though, and my wife liked them, but they weren't much like Cheese Nips.  A lot of recipes would benefit from the use of rolling pin rings to establish uniform dough thickness.<br /><br />I also had mixed results with the recipes from More Top Secret Recipes. You can read my amazingly similar review on that book for more details.<br /><br />Using this book was fun and informative.  I've had mixed results using these books.  In short, have fun, but don't expect miracles with every recipe.'t expect miracles with every recipe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-01

There are three \\"Top Secret Recipes\\" books, Top Secret Recipes, More Top Secret Recipes (this book) and Even More Top Secret Recipes.  These books focus on what Wilbur calls \\"convenience foods.\\"  That is, most packaged sweets and fast food.  He also has a book Top Secret Restaurant Recipes, in which he attempts to duplicate the foods of mostly casual dining restaurants like Chili's and Applebee's.  He also has a book solely on drinks.<br /><br />Wilbur explains in the Introduction of More Top Secret Recipes that these are not the actual recipes used by restaurants, and he did not obtain them through bribery, theft other illegal or illicit means.  He starts with the ingredient list on packages of food and modifies the relative amounts, or with fast food, tries to identify the ingredients by taste.  He admits that the real producers of these foods often use custom ingredients unavailable to the consumer, and that the goal was to match the texture and flavor of the food, and appearance is secondary.<br /><br />So why try to clone commercially-available food?  In both More Top Secret Recipes and Even More Top Secret Recipes, the author mentions availability.  Some of the foods are regional, and you may not get them where you live.  In the introduction to More Top Secret Recipes, he gives a list of reasons including low cost and curiosity.  I'm not so sure about the cost argument, since a dozen Three Musketeers had $5 of chocolate chips in it alone, but the curiosity is what applied to me.  I just wanted to know, \\"Can I really duplicate these commercial foods at home?\\"<br /><br />This book contains recipes cloning the likes of McDonald's, Nabisco, Carl's Jr. and Taco Bell.  Every recipe includes a history of the food item, something alone which makes this book valuable, and a dimensioned engineering graphic of the product.  In addition, More Top Secret Recipes includes an introduction with questions from readers, like, \\"What have you heard from the companies whose products you are copying,\\" (nothing) and \\"After testing all of these recipes, aren't you a huge, fat pig?\\" (No.)  The recipes make as much use as possible of premade food and mixes.  For example, most candy bars are coated with melted chocolate chips, so you will not find that you have to crush cocoa beans, or perform any such low-level task.<br /><br />So far from this book, I have made (attempted to make) Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls, M&M/Mars' Three Musketeers, Nabisco Chips Ahoy! and Nabisco Oreo cookies.<br /><br />The Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls were a success.  But then, I've never had the real thing, so I can't compare.  My wife wasn't sure about the cream cheese frosting being right, but we both loved them anyway.  The Three Musketeers were another pretty good success.  Of course, I can't duplicate the exact shape and size that M&M/Mars can with millions of dollars of machines, and the chocolate coating was a little thick, and never got really firm, but the texture and taste were dead-on.  Chips Ahoy! are kind of personal because my grandmother used to make them. Really.  They didn't turn out dark enough without overbaking (remember the disclaimers), but they resulted with the perfect, crispy texture of the real thing.  However, the taste wasn't quite right.  They were so good, though, that when I make chocolate chip cookies from now on, I will use this recipe instead of the traditional Toll House recipe (The main difference seems to be that the Chips Ahoy! recipe omits eggs.)  The Oreos were just plain bad.  The filling was not at all firm enough (the consistency of cake icing - which it basically is.)  My cookies were too thin, but still chewy although baking the recommended time.  Playing with the thickness and baking time and temperature may give better results.  For many of these recipes, rolling pin rings would be beneficial to assure proper thickness.<br /><br />Using this book was fun and informative.  I've had mixed results using these books.

After reading many reviews, I purchased this book, BACKCOUNTRY COOKING, and THE BACK-COUNTRY KITCHEN by Teresa Marrone.  I can't help but compare the two books, so my opinion on this book is relative to my opinion of the other.<br /><br />The introduction of BACKCOUNTRY COOKING categorizes camp chefs as Ascetics, Pragmatists or Gourmands.  This book leans heavily toward the ascetic-pragmatist end of the scale.  As the subtitle, FROM PACK TO PLATE IN 10 MINUTES, may suggest, the emphasis is on quickly-prepared meals.  As a consequence, the meals tend to be simple.  If you're someone for whom part of the challenge of the camp experience is to create fabulous multi-course meals in the wild, this book is not for you.  And, as expected for a book from BACKPACKER magazine, the emphasis is on light packing and cooking with a single-burner stove.<br /><br />The first part of the book discusses ingredients, tool and procedures as does Marrone's book, but I find the discussion in THE BACK-COUNTRY KITCHEN to be better and more complete, in particular, providing much more detail in home drying foods.  BACKCOUNTRY COOKING discusses a plethora of grains, most of which I've never seen in a grocery store. (Different kinds of oats, different kinds of rice, bread bases, etc.)  Baking methods are very briefly touched upon, but the book goes little beyond single-burner stove-top cooking.<br /><br />Sidebars from different magazine contributors are interspersed throughout the book, and give good tips.  Some black-and-white photos are also sprinkled throughout the book.<br /><br />After the introduction, the book goes into the chapters containing the recipes, with each chapter representing a meal  or course.  One very nice thing is that each recipe includes nutritional information.<br /><br />Now, I just have a so-so opinion of this book, and it was hard for me to establish why.  Like I said, I found the introductory information to be better in the other book.  But I think part of my indifference is due to the recipes.  There seem to be a lot of ethnic foods - Oriental, Middle Eastern, Mexican.  The desserts are mostly rice and bread puddings (yick), and include mincemeat (for dessert?!).  Maybe you eat a lot of hummus, but I suspect many people will find that a lot of the recipes are not the kind of things you find at home, and perhaps the trail is not the best place to find out that your body has strange reactions to strange food.  Furthermore, many of the ingredients, such as the grains and beans, are things I just don't see in the local supermarket.  To the author's credit, they give a complete appendix of mail-order companies, but I'm not particularly excited about paying shipping to experiment with recipes.<br /><br />Teresa Marrone's book, although including more multi-burner, multi-pot recipes for canoeists, car campers and others able to carry more gear, also has many single-burner lightweight recipes for hiking.  It seemed to me that her book had more recipes that BACKCOUNTRY COOKING but, in fact, the number of recipes were similar.  (BACKCOUNTRY COOKING has 144, and THE BACK-COUNTRY KITCHEN has 150.)<br /><br />My recommendation is to start with Marrone's THE BACK-COUNTRY KITCHEN.  If you feel the need for more single-burner meals, or more quickly-prepared meals, augment it with BACKCOUNTRY COOKING.ifference is due to the recipes.

This book is subtitled CAMP COOKING FOR CANOEISTS, HIKERS AND ANGLERS. The rather varying needs of these types of people are well addressed. The canoeist, or someone camping by car, will carry more pots and pans than the hiker, but with over 150 recipes, all can find something. My wife and I currently only camp by car, but hope to start camping by kayak, and this book was right down our alley.<br /><br /> The recipes are good and are rather &quot;normal&quot; foods like you'd have at home. (Some camping books promote some pretty strange things.) The emphasis is on preparation at home, using ingredients that are light, easily packed and travel well. Most of the recipes require a little more preparation time and are more sophisticated than what you'll find in other books. (If you want quickly prepared, but plainer (stranger?), meals for hiking, see BACKCOUNTRY COOKING by Miller.) The opening chapters discuss the selection of camping food ingredients, and includes a substantial description of home drying which rivals the information in books devoted exclusively to the subject such as HOW TO DRY FOODS. You will probably find having a home dehydrator will be beneficial to get the most from this book. The author describes selection of camp cooking equipment such as stoves, cookware and eating utensils, and briefly discusses camping over an open fire, or with some of the camp ovens available, although most of the recipes are for a camping stove. Then there are ten chapters of recipes, such as &quot;Soups,&quot; &quot;Breakfast,&quot; &quot;Main Dishes,&quot; and &quot;Beverages.&quot; Each recipe is marked by icons indicating how many pots are needed, if the ingredients are readily available at grocery stores, whether it requires home drying, or if it requires canned foods. Clear black and white photos are interspersed throughout the book, and there are two sections of color photographs.<br /><br /> I found the first part of the book to be very valuable on its own. By knowing how to prepare ingredients for camping, such as clarifying butter, you can adopt your own recipes or dry mix foods for camping. I tried the upside-down sloppy Joes and beef stroganoff, and later, my wife informed me that mixes were available in the grocery store, so rather than collect all of the ingredients called for in the recipe, I adopted the prepared mixes. Unlike some other camp cook books that rely heavily on freeze dried foods sitting in some general store in the wilds of Colorado somewhere (or require mail ordering), most ingredients are available at the average supermarket (although despite seemingly having EVERYTHING by Knorr, my local Publix does not seem to have the mushroom SAUCE [not GRAVY] called for by the beef stroganoff recipe!).<br /><br /> If you only want one book on camp cooking, want to be rewarded with a satisfying meal, and don't mind a little preparation in camp, this is the book to have. It will take many years of camping to try all of the recipes in this book that interest us.s home drying, or if it requires canned foods.

Books	5	11	15	N	N	A Breath of Fresh Air.	It was refreshing to see such sensible, critical thinking from a prominent member of the big media. Stossel comes to the conclusions that thinking people come to concerning many big issues and gives insight to how the media willingly trumpets the liberal company line without questioning the sources.<br /><br /> Stossel starts the book with an entertaining, short description of his career and his advance from a young TV journalist who accepted what he was told without question, to the contrarian &quot;scourge of the liberal media.&quot;<br /><br /> Then he gets into the meat of the book. He questions the need for child labor laws, the FDA, OSHA, and EPA. He suggests the private organizations like UL would certify drugs much more quickly and less expensively than the FDA. He suggests that the government has taken over way too much of what can be done better by private industry, and suggests that leaving capitalism to run on its own benefits more people than government overregulation. Stossel attacks junk science and points out what we should really be afraid of. He points out that sports team owners are some of the largest freeloaders, attacks national flood insurance (while admitting that he himself was a walfare queen) and how eminent domain has run amok. Of course, he spends some time explaining how welfare keeps people bound by poverty and how our legal system encourages lawsuits as a get-rich-quick scheme that mostly benefits lawyers. This is just a sample of the topics this book discusses.<br /><br /> I found it interesting when we reveals how the liberal community gets bent of shape when someone in the media presents a different viewpoint, demanding his firing and withdrawal of all archived files containing the story when he made an innocent, minor mistake on one of his shows that had no bearing on the conclusion of the show anyway. Who knew that organic foods were such a holy cow of the left? And there was the irrational reception he received at Brown University while investigating an alleged rape. Stossel apparently had already been branded a &quot;woman-hater&quot; because he ran a report that &quot;boys and girls are different.&quot; Any intelligent debate would not be allowed on campus. For a few moments there, I thought I was reading Ann Coulter talking about the character assasination of Ken Starr or Joe McCarthy!<br /><br /> Lest somebody thinks he totally went over the right, he assures the reader, &quot;I'm hardly what you call conservative. I happen to think consenting adults should be able to do just about anything they want. I think prostitution should be permitted. I believe homosexuality is perfectly natural, that the drug war should be ended, that flag burning and foul language should be tolerated, and most abortion should be legal. This is conservative? Real conservatives should be insulted.&quot; I am.<br /><br /> By the way, he refers to his current beliefs as Libertarian, but wishes to distance himself from the Libertarian political party that promotes &quot;flaky&quot; candidates like Howard Stern. Stossel spends the last few chapters discussing his beliefs that drugs and prostitution should be legalized. Although I, personally, am not prepared to concede those points, he makes good points and challenges the readers thinking. He doesn't address the harder-to-defend support of abortion and homosexuality, though.<br /><br /> I discovered the book seeing a summary of a show of Stossel's on a web site, entitled something like &quot;10 Media Myths.&quot; He addressed gun control where he concludes what most people who have studied the issue know: Gun control only turns law-abiding citizens into victims, and criminals are afraid of potential victims being armed. This book was promoted in that article, but the book does not address this topic.University while investigating an alleged rape.

Nowhere on the front or back cover, or inside flaps, is the reader told that the book is about benchrest shooting, except that the back cover indicates that the author is a champion in benchrest shooting. Yet the book is almost exclusively on benchrest shooting. The title page is even more misleading with the subtitle, &quot;A handbook for those who seek the ultimate in rifle accuracy; whether it be for competition, testing, or hunting.&quot;<br /><br /> I picked up this book thinking that it would help me in my rifle shooting. I thought it would tell me how to hold the rifle in different positions like standing, sitting or prone. Of course, it only addresses bench rest. I expected the author to explain what features that contribute to accuracy to look for in a rifle, but he talks primarily about specific manufacturers and parts instead of what to look for in components. In a field where many components are made by small one-man shops, this information can become very dated. At one point, the author uses this forum to complain of a certain manufacturer, and used language that was a bit on the coarse side for a non-fiction technical book.<br /><br /> Chapters include Safety, History, Rifle, the 6PPC, Bullets, the Bench, Wind Shooting, Flags, and different categories of benchrest matches, like Light Varmint, Heavy Varmint and Unlimited/Heavy. I really can't tell the History chapter from the rest of the book, because most of the book seems to be the author telling stories from the history of benchrest shooting. At the end of each chapter, I just felt a hunger for more useful, technical information. In fact, in a couple of places, the author refers the reader to THE ACCURATE RIFLE by Warren Page for more detailed information. It seems that this was book I should have purchased instead! A chapter on &quot;Benchrest Techniques for Hunting Rifles&quot; is thrown in, but seems to be a half-hearted attempt at making the book applicable to a more general audience. (I can hear the publisher, &quot;This book is all on benchrest shooting. Add a chapter on hunting so we can sell it to a broader audience.&quot;) Note that there is an entire chapter on the 6mm PPC cartridge. If you're not using it, you're a nobody, and you're not going to get any help here.<br /><br /> The benchrest glossary in the back was pretty good, and in fact, if the reader reads it first, he has a better chance of following the remainder of the book. It is hard to tell who the intended audience is. Obviously, it is solely for someone with an interest in benchrest shooting, but to an experienced benchrest shooter, it is too basic. To someone with no previous knowledge of benchrest shooting, it skips some basics. (After a few chapters, I begin to get the impression that benchrest shooting only measures group size, rather than calculate a target score as with other type of shooting competitions, but that is never explicitly stated. I am also still puzzled as to the purpose of that square on the targets.)<br /><br /> Although the book has photos (probably more than half are of prominent benchrest competitors either shooting or holding awards or targets), it could use more drawings to explain the technical points. It is hard to describe reloading with just words.<br /><br /> I conclude that the book is for a novice who has had an introduction to benchrest shooting, and wants a cursory overview of the sport. With a few changes, and an appropriate title, this book might be a good one. For example, change the title to &quot;Introduction to Benchrest Shooting,&quot; delete the &quot;hunting&quot; chapter, and add a chapter explaining the basics of the sport, such as the GOAL. With changes like this it wouldn't lead the wrong audience to purchase it, and would be more valuable to the correct audience.own in, but seems to be a half-hearted attempt at making the book applicable to a more general audience.

I came to this book because I wanted to make pizza in a Dutch oven while camping!  All Dutch oven pizza recipes were the same - form some pre-made dough in the oven, cover with sauce, cheese and toppings, and bring oven to baking temperature.  This resulted in a pizza which left a lot to be desired.<br />I needed information on pizza making that said WHY something was done, and not just recipes, so I could adjust to my odd situation.  Dr. DeAngelis, like I, is an engineering Ph.D., so I expected some &quot;why.&quot;  I was not disappointed.  Also, like he, I was born in PA where a pizza parlor was on nearly every block with names like Ferregonio's, Costa's and Veltre's, so I figured he knew pizza.<br />On these counts, I was not disappointed.<br />However, I quickly discovered why pizzeria-quality pizza is so elusive for the home baker: (1) Proper ingredients are often unavailable to the consumer, (2) proper utensils are expensive and/or not readily available to the consumer, (3) the process is time-consuming, and (4) getting good quality pizza is more a function of adhering to many little details rather than any one big item.<br />Dr. DeAngelis asserts that the most important item is to use high-gluten flour.  You cannot find this at the local supermarket.  You have to find a baking supply house, and the flour comes in 25, 50 or 100 lb. bags, and he adds that anything but the 100 lb. may be hard to locate.  And he recommends sharp American cheese!  So far, I've been unable to find sharp American.<br />The other important thing is proper kneading with a STRONG preference to using a machine.  He recommends a several-hundred-dollar Kitchen Aid mixer, but says that anything with at least 250 W is adequate, meaning that my Sunbeam Mixmaster just meets the requirement (but it gets awfully hot).  Just be warned that if you do not have a good mixer, processor or bread machine, you may be frustrated.  Like the flour, the recommended pans are only available at restaurant supply houses.<br />As for time-consuming, getting the best results involves allowing the dough to rise under the right conditions for the right time.  People with normal lives may find it difficult to time things just right so you're home to take the dough out of the refrigerator 16 hours after making it.<br />Nonetheless, if you follow the instructions as best as you can with what you have available, you can achieve a pretty good pizza that will even impress your wife!  The reviewer from the neighboring town of Cocoa probably found what I did; the local phone book does not HAVE the listings for baking suppliers that the author gives, so I too, used bread flour, which has a higher gluten content than all-purpose.  I otherwise followed the directions, using his dough dressing (dressing is important), but used a canned spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese.  Despite the crust looking like it was formed by a two-year-old, when baked, it looked very much like a pizzeria crust, and was amazingly tasty!  Perhaps not quite there yet, but certainly a quantum leap above anything I've made before.<br />The book is neatly divided into chapters such as dough, dough dressing, utensils, procedure and others.  Of course, it is &quot;spiral&quot; bound, so lies flat when open.  I doubt I will use the additional recipes as I like pretty conventional pizza, but they are there for things like Buffalo chicken pizza.  I will eventually use his sauce recipe and try other recommended cheeses.  Also, the flour and recommended utensils are available from the author's web site for very reasonable prices and shipping.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in making pizza at home.  I have some experimentation yet at home and with the Dutch oven before I feel like I've arrived, but this book has put me on the right path.pply houses.<br />As for time-consuming, getting the best results involves allowing the dough to rise under the right conditions for the right time.

Of course, it is &quot;spiral&quot; bound, so lies flat when open.  I doubt I will use the additional recipes as I like pretty conventional pizza, but they are there for things like Buffalo chicken pizza.  I will eventually use his sauce recipe and try other recommended cheeses.  Also, the flour and recommended utensils are available from the author's web site for very reasonable prices and shipping.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in making pizza at home.  I have some experimentation yet at home and with the Dutch oven before I feel like I've arrived, but this book has put me on the right path.	2004-07-13

In that respect, it falls flat on its face.  What few equations there are are so poorly typeset that they are rendered useless.  Some of the equations include constants that require use of certain units, but these are not often made clear.<br />This book, however, covers an amazing array of topics at a level that's good for someone without a desire to implement the math.  The writing is in a very &quot;folksy&quot; style that makes some of the topics go down more easily, although the whole book is in need of editing.  I would think that most gun enthusiasts would benefit from this book.  It adequately answers many questions that I see raised again and again, such as why heavier bullets from a handgun hit higher on the target.<br />The terminal ballistics section is a small part of the book and a very cursory discussion, although it was a large part of another reviewer's complaint.  The subject of terminal ballistics is so full of debate and emotion that no treatment of the subject is going to go by without criticism.<br />Many of the figures are poorly hand-drawn illustrations.<br />I would like to see another edition with &quot;to Advanced&quot; dropped from the title, any attempt to introduce math dropped altogether, editing for spelling, grammar and clear presentation, and with illustrations by an artist.  And in deference to the other reviewers, perhaps updated with the latest research in terminal ballistics.  With these changes, this book would be an even better introduction that I would recommend to all gun owners who are not interested in implementing the math.	2004-07-01

They water at the wrong time. They fertilize too much.  They cut their grass too low or too often.<br />EVERY FLORIDA HOMEOWNER SHOULD OWN AND READ THIS BOOK!  The lawn is a large investment, and this is a small price to pay to take care of it.  This is the bible for Florida lawnowners.<br />This book is very complete.  There are chapters on planting, water, fertilizing, insects and disease. And there is a chapter (or two!) on each common variety of Florida turf grass.  This book is written by Florida university researchers and agricultural extension agents, so is the most authoritative reference there is.<br />I have two main complaints, although these problems are often interlinked.  First, the chapters are written by different authors.  As a result, there is some inconsistency in advice and writing style, and many topics are repeated.  The second is that it can be a little technical.  This could be remedied with an introductory chapter with pictures and definitions of the terminology used in the book.  The authors assume that you know what the different parts of the grass plant are.  As a new homeowner, I didn't even know what thach was.<br />I am going to use the info from this book and from the St. John's River Water Management District web site to write an article for my homeowner's association newsletter.  Perhaps the neighbors will quit wasting water watering the mailbox in the evening from which I have to retrieve my mail.	2003-06-10

This is the story of how one man fought cancer and became &quot;the first American, riding an American-made bike, on an American team ever to win the Tour,&quot; catapulting the sport of cycling, before, a primarily European sport, into the awareness of Americans.<br />In short, Lance was a promising biker when in 1996 he was diagnosed with testicular cancer.  He went through brain surgery and difficult chemotherapy to eventually lick the disease, and then returned to biking to win the 1999 and 2000 Tour de France.  (He's also won the 2001 Tour, but the book doesn't go that far.)<br />But the book is not just about the cancer.  For a reader who is new to bicycle racing, it makes a fairly good primer on racing, explaining the different events, the terminology, and the tactics; and introducing the reader to the big names in the sport.  It is also a love story of how he met his wife, Kik, and goes almost as in-depth into the in-vitro fertilization process necessary to have their son, Luke, as it does into the cancer treatment.<br />The book charts Lance's transformation from a young, brash competitor who usually angered the other racers, to a more disciplined, thinking stategist.  It's also interesting to note that Lance, now considered the man to beat in the climbs, used to be a sprinter before the cancer transformed his body.<br />The only thing that I found disappointing about this book is that Armstrong neither depends on a faith in God nor develops any through his ordeal, so it fails to be the inspirational story that I had hoped it would be.  Despite that, I found the book very interesting, informative, and difficult to put down.	2001-10-30

A must-read.	I have been wanting to expand my understanding of Christian apologetics for many years by reading Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands a Verdict.  Thumbing through the book in bookstores showed it to be in a rather dry outline form that discouraged me from actually following through.  I was introduced to Lee Strobel a couple years ago when a pastor at my church was teaching my Bible study class from Strobel's God's Outrageous Claims.  I recently discovered that Strobel wrote a book investigating the claims of Christianity and was eager to read it.  That book is The Case for Christ.  It proved to be more readable than Evidence, but still convicingly makes the case for Christ.<br />Strobel, a lawyer and journalist, who covered the topsy-turvy world of Chicago crime, applied his training to verify or discount the claims of Christianity.  An admitted atheist, he took up this task after his wife accepted Christ as Lord and Savior.<br />He studied all of the information he could find from both supporters and detractors of Christianity and then set out on a several year voyage of research and interviews with experts in various fields.  The Case for Christ is a history of this voyage.<br />Strobel applies the various legal evidences that would be required for a conviction in the courts: eyewitness accounts, documents, corroboration, science, rebuttals, psychology, profiles, &quot;fingerprints,&quot; medical evidences and circumstantial evidence.  There are 14 chapters in all, and in each, he examines a different type of evidence and interviews an acknowledged expert in the field, travelling all over the US to do so.  Each chapter addresses a question such as: Do historical accounts outside of the Bible confirm the life of Jesus?  Were the eyewitnesses reliable?  Was there credible evidence of the empty tomb?  Could Jesus have survived the flogging and crucifixion?  The list goes on an on, and I can't imagine that it leaves many stones unturned for someone verifying the claims of the church.<br />All in all, he verifies the claims of Christianity most convincingly, and does so in a very academic manner.  Even though this book is fairly easy to read, it is appropriately referenced.  These can be very complex subjects, and about the only complaint that might be levied on this book is that it does not go deep enough.  To do so would require volumes, though, and Strobel gives references for someone wanting to investigate further.<br />I was trying to complete another book when I picked this one up.  A mistake.  I had trouble putting it back down.  I certainly recommend this book to all Christians.  It is not afraid to ask difficult questions, and is a welcome change from the fluffy, feel-good books that flood Christian book stores.  Although this is information with which every Christian should be familiar, I also recommend the book for anyone investigating the claims of Christianity.<br />We all probably suspect the end: Strobel, facing the undeniable mountain of evidence, accepts Christ himself, concluding, &quot;it would require much more faith for me to maintain my atheism that to trust in Jesus of Nazareth!&quot;laims of the church.<br />All in all, he verifies the claims of Christianity most convincingly, and does so in a very academic manner.

So many books on cycling health or training start with an assumption that your last name is Merckx, Armstrong or LeMond. Biking is, in my opinion, the most excellent way for someone overweight and in poor cardiovascular health to get into shape, as few other activities allow someone to ease into better performance. Being one of those people, I was persuaded to buy Bicycling Medicine because the subtitle said &quot;for riders of all levels.&quot; This book is true to its title.<br />The author, Arnie Baker, is a physician, a competitive cyclist and cycling coach. I liked his very conservative view of medicine. He does not hype techniques and products, and gives a balanced view of advantages and disadvantages of the subjects. (After reading the effects of too much vitamins, you will probably not want to take supplements again.) He honestly discusses the limitations of medicine and medical testing.<br />The book is divided into five parts, and further divided into 81 mini-chapters. Each chapter tackles one subject in a succinct manner - short, easy, but adequate. Most chapters starts with &quot;What We're Talking About&quot; that introduces and defines the subject before delving more deeply into it. Some of the subjects are nutrition, energy use vs. effort, vitamins, performance aids, heart rate training, muscle physiology, optimum cycle fit, injury treatments, medical problems and general health. The range of topics covered is simply astounding. Baker even discusses how to urinate while riding, which side of your body is best to sleep on, and how to shave your legs. He discusses gender-specific topics honestly and maturely, as you would expect from a physician.<br />The book is sparesly illustrated, and does not require many additional figures, but if you need lots of glossy photos of racers cutting through corners to keep your attention, you won't find them here. Most of the figures in the books are of a cartoon character demonstrating a very complete array of stretching exercises.<br />My complaints are very few, and are to be considered more of suggestions for later editions. A couple of additional figures could be helpful in the bike fitting sections. I was a little confused by &quot;...angle from the horizontal formed by the knee at the bottom on the pedal stroke.&quot; (p.119) I think I get it, but I'm still not quite sure. &quot;Handlebar angle&quot; on p.149 could have been illustrated. On p. 97, energy and power are confused. This is important to an engineer such as myself, and I think the author understands it, too, but got lazy at this point with the terminology (work is energy and is therefore not measured in Watts, which is power). On pp. 110-111, while I understand efficiency very well, I am kind of lost by his definition of economy. And the related example confuses me more. Is economy energy per distance, or energy per speed? &quot;Fewer calories are needed to travel at the same speed&quot; doesn't make total sense without establishing the distance over which the speed was maintained. Figure 1-4 has &quot;Low,&quot; &quot;Medium,&quot; and &quot;High&quot; exercise intensities on the x-axis of the graph, and in the text he defines these as 65%, 75% and 90% of maximum heart rate. Why not just put those value on the graph?<br />Again, I consider these complaints minor.<br />I recommend this book to everyone who is beginning cycling and wants to cycle for fitness, or has any desire to measure and improve his performance. It is a fantastic starting point. After reading this book, you will have enough understanding to ask other questions or to seek out more in-depth resources on the subjects that interest you most. Someone with years of cycling involving some sort of training may find the book somewhat basic, though, but it may still be a useful, very general, reference.ching exercises.<br />My complaints are very few, and are to be considered more of suggestions for later editions.

This is an excellent book on the maintenance and repair of all bicycles.<br />Each of the 17 chapters discusses one component of the bike, such as rear derailleurs, front derailleurs, brakes, wheels, suspension, frame and others.  Each chapter begins with a drawn illustration of the system, which is followed by a text description of the system and maintenane and repair of the system.  This is followed by a troubleshooting section listing common problems and their solutions.  But the best part of each chapter are the step-by-step procedures with excellent black-and-white photographs of each step.<br />In addition to discussing bike systems, there are chapters on creating a home workshop and even how to box a bike.  (Exactly how my bike came from its manufacturer!)<br />There's really not a lot more to ask for from this book.  The main complaint is that some of it seems a little out-of-date despite its 1999 copyright date, and I regret now that I did not list examples as they struck me, but a minor one, for example, was ignorance of 10-speed cassettes.  However, some bicycle components are changing rapidly, and it's difficult for authors to keep up.  Note that this is the 4th &quot;expanded and revised&quot; edition, so it does appear that the editors of Bicycling have made a commitment to update the book regularly.<br />I also got bogged down some times in the text description of procedures without pictures, but everything is clear when you get back into the step-by-step procedure section with the photographs.  So it also seems that information is unnecessarily repeated.<br />Bicycling magazine has run articles on how to get home from different types of roadside breakdowns.  It would be nice if they include this as one separate chapter that can be read before a trip.  The rest of the book lends itself to a &quot;only read the chapter I need at the moment&quot; type of use.  You don't need to read through the whole book to understand chapter 15 on saddles, for example.<br />I have also read and reviewed Complete Idiot's Guide to Bike Maintenance and Repair, and despite its knowledgable author and fun style, did not have step-by-step illustrations which are required for such a book.  Others have also recommended the books by Zinn and Van Der Plas, and I have seen them and they look good, but separate books are written by each author for road bikes and mountain bikes, while this book is one reference for all bikes.<br />I have also read and reviewed Complete Idiot's Guide to Bike Maintenance and Repair, and despite its knowledgable author and fun style, did not have step-by-step illustrations which are required for such a book.

So I might enjoy some things that may other can't appreciate.  Bicycling Science is for the bicyclist, or someone interested in human-powered vehicles (HPV), who has a background in science, engineering and/or mathematics.  I absolutely love this book.  There are few books that I've enjoyed more.  The reasons why I don't give it five stars are below.<br />This book can help one separate reality from marketing hype.  Does cutting down the weight of spokes really help much?  How does crank length affect performance?  What affect does cooling have on a cyclist?  How much does the difference between cheap bearings and good bearings affect performance?  How fast should you really pedal?  Are aluminum, titanium and carbon fiber vastly superior to steel?  How heavily is someone breathing when they begin breathing through their mouths?  How efficient is a person on a bike (in energy per mass per person per speed) compared to a bus, moped, swimmer, horse or hopping bunny?  How many wives can you trade your bike for in Nigeria?  These questions, and many more, are answered in this book.<br />The style is very much that of an academic journal, and the book is a survey of the literature in the field.  References abound.  The authors do their best to combine the results from different sources into a coherent reference.  If this style is familiar to you, then you will not feel out of place with this book.<br />Chapters in the book include those on human power generation, cyclist cooling, wind resistance, the wheel, mechanical friction, braking, balancing and steering, materials and stress, and future developments.  I particularly like the chapter on stability, an apparently controversial topic.  The chapter presents a plausible theory supported by experiment, and provides a simple equation to calculate a stability factor for a bike design.  The book concludes with an interesting chapter on what advances can be made to bicycles and to the infrastructure to make biking more viable as a form of transportation.<br />I mainly did not give Bicycling Science five stars because it is getting out of date.  I'm sure that much additional research has been performed since the 1982 copyright date, and many advances have been made in the last 20 years, particularly those as a result of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA).  The materials section could add data for some of the newer materials used for bikes such as Reynolds 853 steel and some new titanium alloys.  Also, the authors tried to present data from different sources on common graphs, and in some cases, I am still puzzled at how to interpret some of the plots.  I also felt that sometimes I had a bunch of data dumped in my lap with no conclusions being drawn.  For example, after reading the chapter on human power generation, I wasn't sure if one should always attempt to pedal at 90-100 RPM, or should reduce cadence for the required endurance.<br />My complaints are few and minor, however, and I highly recommend this book to the cyclist, or cycling aficionado, who relishes the math and physics.<br />The only book that I've heard of that seems to be similar is High-Tech Cycling by Edmund Burke.  However, I've not seen it, and reviews of it seem few and far between.infrastructure to make biking more viable as a form of transportation.<br />I mainly did not give Bicycling Science five stars because it is getting out of date.

The &quot;brand new fifth edition&quot; of Basic Dave Diving is last copyrighted 1986.  I'm intrigued by cave diving, but am not yet a cave diver, so I don't know for sure, but question if some of the equipment discussed in absolutely up-to-date.  The addresses for instructors and phone numbers for Florida recompression facilities may also be in question.  I'm trusting, though, that the National Speleological Society (NSS) is not continuing to print something that promotes dangerous, discredited, technique.  Moreoever, I've seen this book in the dive shops in north central Florida, and it still seems to be in use for cave diving instruction.<br />First, for those who judge value in the book by the quality of printing, note that this booklet is a typewritten, photocopied, booklet, copied on 8-1/2-x-11 in paper and folded in half with a cardstock cover.  I just mention this so someone expecting more is not disappointed.<br />The book is divided into 10 short chapters, each 3 to 8 pages long, and the book can be easily read in its entirety in one evening.  Each chapter begins with an actual accident report and an accident analysis leading into the subject of the chapter, whether it be silt, lights, guidline, air supply planning, etc..  Each chapter focusses on one aspect of proper cave diving, and thus the book divides techniques into small, easily digestible, pieces.  Each chapter tells you what it needs to without adding extraneous information to complicate your understanding.<br />Note that the book focusses on cave diving technique in Florida, and warns the reader that different techniques may be appropriate in other locations.<br />I think that this book is a good, inexpensive, introduction to cave diving for someone with a curiosity about this sport, whether or not you plan to pursue it.  The book is also written by the probably best-known person in the field of Cave Diving.  (Don't let the fact that Sheck Exley died cave diving cause you discredit the information in this book - he balanced the risks with the rewards and willingly chose to push the limits of cave diving.)<br />It would be irresponsible of me to conclude this review without a warning.  An open water diver armed with the this book might think that they know enough to safely cave dive, but PLEASE do not attempt cave diving without training from an appropriate agency.  I am an open water divemaster, and do not feel that I yet have the experience to even begin cave diving training.  Before beginning cave or cavern diving training, a diver requires extensive open water experience, must be thoroughly comfortable in the water, must be able to handle emergency situations without panicking, and must be physically fit.ation in this book - he balanced the risks with the rewards and willingly chose to push the limits of cave diving.)<br />It would be irresponsible of me to conclude this review without a warning.

After having researched cycling for several months, it appears that The Bicycle Wheel by Jobst Brandt is considered to be THE standard reference on bicycle wheel building.<br />This book discusses how the wheel works, forces on the wheel, materials and designs of rims, spokes and hubs, truing, repair, and wheel building.<br />The book itself is nicely bound and printed, with extremely clear diagrams.  Space is left on pages when necessary to ensure that the text doesn't get ahead of the figures, which can be rather annoying in something like a repair book.<br />For the most part, I am glad to have purchased this book, but was disappointed to find that a lot of the information in the book, such as wheel truing, materials, component design, and wheel building of a conventional 3-cross wheel, can be gleaned from the internet from such sites as those of Sheldon Brown.  Some of the chapters in this book, such as the results of a finite element model analysis of the forces in a wheel, seem to be more unique to this book.  Moroever, it is difficult to lay the computer down on the floor next to the wheel that you're building to guide you step-by-step, and the book had better illustrations than those I've seen on the web.  Also, the information I mention above seems scattered around the internet, and this book brings them together in one reference.<br />For those who are expecting that The Bicycle Wheel will lead them to build exotic designs with the latest materials and lacing patterns, you will be disappointed.  The author is a staunch believer that the bicycle wheel has been nearly perfected in the 3-cross lacing pattern with steel, cylindrical spokes, and that any &quot;improvements&quot; result in very minimal performance increase at the expense of stength.  Brandt states, &quot;In most cases [sic] it is best to build standard wheels - standard wheels, but good ones - and not yield to fashion, folklore, or advertising.&quot; (Oh yeah - there are missing commas - but that seems to be par for most editing these days.) Later, he states, &quot;They [24-spoke, radially-laced, small-flange-hub, lightweight rimmed wheels - like the Mavic Cosmoses on my bike] lack the long-term durability of road wheels..., &quot; and in the section on Wheel Design, &quot;Cyclists who choose to build wheels often want something more than ordinary,...It may be disappointing to discover that [sic] 'it's all been done before' [sic] and that conventional wheels are a  result of a hundred years of refinement.  The true contribution for the new wheel builder is to build conventional wheels exceptionally well.&quot;<br />Even though this book does have good figures, there are a few places where there are none, and where I wish one were included to help illustrate what's being discussed.  One such place is the section on static loads in the tire and rim  (pp. 14, 15).<br />In the final chapter, Brandt discusses the finite element computer analysis used to calculate forces in the wheel under different conditions.  (Techniques with which I am familiar in electromagnetic applications).  The discussion is in-depth enough that reader without experience in numerical methods will be completely lost (it even mentions details such as the method used to solve the matrix equation), but would leave someone with such knowledge (such as me) wanting.  Little is lost by the one who does not have the math background, but this book could be more useful to mathematicians among readers if it had another page or two with a diagram, and the equations used to fill the matrix and vectors.<br />It may seem that I have a lot of complaints, but overall, I thought this was a very good book, and believe that a complete library on cycling should include it.  The only other book that I've seen on wheelbuilding that seems to be gaining popularity is Shraner's The Art of Wheelbuilding: A Bench Reference for Neophytes, Pros and Wheelaholics.  This book is cleverly spiral-bound to allow it to layflat as you build your wheels.  I have not seen this book in person, but plan to review it in the future.flat as you build your wheels.

There is no such thing as &quot;almost ready to fly&quot; as in RC airplanes.  In fact, there are few kits of any kind, it appears to me.  And Model Submarine Technology is the only book I've been able to find on the topic.  Most of the information is passed on face-to-face, and through newsletters and the internet.<br />This book discusses all the aspects of model submarine design: sealing, through-hull fittings, depth control, attitude control, etc.  It contains enough equations to allow you to design your own model submarine.  In fact, you could use them to design a full-size sub!  The book even contains circuit diagrams and PC board layout for an electronic attitude controller.<br />Be warned, however, that this is a British translation of a German text.  (In fact, be warned that all Traplet books are British.)  The sentence structure seems odd at times, and I'm not sure if that's from an attempt to produce a more word-for-word translation of the German, or if it's due to the translator's British English, which just sounds somewhat unusual to this American reader.  Some of the variable names represent German words and didn't get translated, and the typesetting of the equations has errors in places.  Furthermore, the book refers to components that may not be available to the American reader, and, of course, doesn't discuss the limited number of kits and model submarine components that are available in North America.<br />Note that the book description indicates that the book discusses scale torpedos, among other topics.  However, the author is apparently a strong pacifist, and his only discussion of torpedos is that he refuses to discusss them because, &quot;it is all too easy for children - in particular - to &quot;play about&quot; with such gruesome machines and thereby lose sight of their devastating intent and capability.&quot; &quot;I don't wish to be associated with that,&quot; he further states, and maintains that, &quot;the primary purpose of submaries - even military ones - is to provide under-water transport over long periods and distances, and these vessels can therefore be categorised principally as a means of travel.&quot;  Hmmm.  I don't see too many underwater oil tankers, though.<br />If you have the skills and patience to experiement and scratch-build a submarine model, or if you're just fascinated in the technology and physics, this may be the only book you find despite its few flaws.  Otherwise, you may want to consider another hobby.e torpedos, among other topics.

Rails-to-trail are trails created from abdondoned railroad beds.  They are valued for a number of activities because of their shallow grades that were required by trains.  The Rails-to-Trail Conservancy is the US national organization promoting the creation of Rails-to-Trails, and Rails-to-Trails Florida is their official guidebook.<br />The book describes 17 &quot;top&quot; rails-trails, 6 &quot;more&quot; rail-trails (ones so new that more detail could not be included) and 11 state park trails across the state, each in its own section.  There is also a section on the Florida trail system.  The state park trails are mostly unpaved trails for mountain bikers and equestrians, and are not rail bed conversions.  The author warns that they may be excluded in future printings as more rail-trails are finished.<br />The author is obviously a cyclist, but the information in the book applied to runners, walkers, equestrians, skaters and those in wheelchairs.<br />There are maps of the state in the front, and each trail is described on two or more pages, with a local map, usually at least one photo, icons indicating activites on and along the trail, a summary description, and a long description giving a mile-by-mile account of the trail and a history of the railroad that preceded it.<br />The state maps don't include the &quot;more&quot; trails, and could use more detail, such as county boundaries and major roads.<br />Although the author suggests getting more detailed maps, there is no reason that more detail couldn't be included in the trail maps, such as more roads, particularly those leading to intermediate stations.  I'd like to drive to one of the intermediate stations along the West Orange Trail, for example.  There are some other detail problems.  If you look for SR 419 while on SR 417, you'll never find it as the highway signs only refer to it as 434, but the book doesn't tell you that.  The author also implies that the beginning of the Cady Way Trail begins in the parking lot of Fashion Square mall when it is, in fact, across a street.<br />New trails are being opened, and new rights-of-way procured for trails, in Florida almost daily, it seems.  To remain useful, this book will have to be updated almost annually.  I hope it keeps up-to-date.<br />A similar resource are the three volumes of Florida Rail-Trail Bicycling by Joan Lundquist Scalpone, describing 46, 44, and 43 rides, respectively.  The three books cover municipal trails and bike routes, and park trails as well as rail-trails, but the three books will cost more than Rails-to-Trails Florida and only cover about 15 of the Rail-Trails.parking lot of Fashion Square mall when it is, in fact, across a street.<br />New trails are being opened, and new rights-of-way procured for trails, in Florida almost daily, it seems.

This is a fabulous general book on cycling.<br />I was looking for a general book on cycling and was deciding between this and Bicycling for Dummies.  I let Bicycle Book's dense text, many pages and a statement on the cover of, &quot;the bestselling bike book of all time with over 1 million copies sold!&quot; sway me to buy it.<br />My biggest concern with an update of a book first written in 1972 is whether it was really rewritten, or just had some new bits tacked on. (The way to &quot;modernize&quot; a photography book is tack on a chapter on digital imaging.)  I was extremely pleased while reading this book to see that the whole book seemed to have been written yesterday, so if it is an update, Ballantine when through a lot of effort to review and update every paragraph.<br />This book is so complete and covers every type of bicycle, not focussing on just road bikes and mountain bikes.  In addition to the expected chapters on cycling history, types of bikes, and bicycle maintenance, he includes chapters on learning to ride a bike (a method guaranteed to have anyone riding a bike in 15 minutes!), riding in traffic, urban commuting, cargo cycles and trailers, careers in cycling, veteran and classic bikes, and more.  Ballantine is also a big proponent of recumbent bikes, and include a rather extensive chapter on that subject.  (About has me convinced to skip the conventional &quot;safety&quot; bike and get a recumbent!)<br />Unlike many authors, Ballantine is not hesitant to actually recommend certain manufacturers for different components.  This is invaluable for a beginner biker like myself, who is trying to identify the quality products on the market - a task that would otherwise cost a lot of time, money and heartache.  The author includes extensive addresses, references and internet URL's for organizations all over the world.  The book is directed to the American audience, but the author seems to be British, or lives, or has lived, in Great Britain (it wasn't clear to me).  Anyway, this brings an international experience to the book that adds a lot of value.<br />Some people might be bothered by the author's belief in biological evolution and global warming, and by his anti-automobile stance.  This is not too pervasive, though, except in the last chapter, and doesn't distract too much from the author's knowledge of the subject.  The book is mostly illustrated with faux etchings of images from the classical ages of biking and includes no actual photos.  Some photos of modern equipment would be nice.  (In fact, other reviewers praised Ballantine's out-of-print Ultimate Bicycle Book for its photos, so we know he can do it.)  Thumbing through the book and seeing the old-timey drawing and no modern photos is one thing that made me wonder if the book had been truly updated.<br />I might still give Cycling for Dummies a chance.  It looked pretty good, but I certainly give Richard's 4-and-a-half stars.lear to me).

I bought a bike 11 days ago (and, as this and other authors [who all run bike shops, it seems] say, is a disdainful &quot;department store&quot; bike - but I'm starting cheap to see if I stay with it.) I bought this book the next day. On the way to the post office on my third or fourth trip out, a tire goes flat. Having read most of this book, I walked into the local bike shop for the first time and confidently asked for tire levers and a patch kit. The helpful saleswoman immediately went and got them for me, and as I was checking out, having incorrectly identified me as an experienced biker, she began to talk to me of problems with a customer's bike they were looking at in back and of the Tour de France.<br />This book seems to have done the trick.<br />I was wanting a more general book than one only on maintenance, and I wanted the maintenance sections to cover all bikes. There are several books available just on road bikes or just on moutain bikes. This book does what I want, and began with an interesting history of bicycles. In usual Idiot's Guide style, the book is easy to read, has a personable style and interesting margin notes defining terminology, giving some related, interesting facts, or giving notes of warning. The author seems to be very qualified and knowledgable to write such a book. I thought the sections on on-the-road emergencies, buying a bike, and riding a bike were particularly helpful, and were nice additions.<br />However, this book has one major flaw. Almost all of the figures were supplied by Park Tool and Campagnolo. If the author had one of these illustrations that demonstrated the subject of the text, he inserted it, but often there was no figure, or the figure didn't quite illustrate the text. In a book on maintenance, good figures showing the procedures are a must - especially for a book aimed at beginners as this is (It IS an &quot;idiot's guide,&quot; after all). Figures are also needed to simply show what items look like. I could probably find several examples on every page, but how about a diagram of a butted tube, or of a quill pedal, or of the different brake systems?<br />Although this book meets its goal somewhat painfully (you may need to sit in front of a bike to figure out what it is trying to describe in words), a much better book is Bicycling Magazine's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance and Repair for Road and Mountain Bikes. Its authors have not skimped on the figures as those of the Idiot's Guide have, including clear step-by-step black-and-white photos of all procedures.  For those wanting some color, and don't mind that mountain bikes and road bikes are covered in separate books, you may want to examine the books by Zinn and Van der Plas, which I've seen but have not read.obably find several examples on every page, but how about a diagram of a butted tube, or of a quill pedal, or of the different brake systems?<br />Although this book meets its goal somewhat painfully (you may need to sit in front of a bike to figure out what it is trying to describe in words), a much better book is Bicycling Magazine's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance and Repair for Road and Mountain Bikes.

Not necessarily bad if it says what it needs to succinctly.  Unfortunately, this book didn't do that.  Procedures could be explained more clearly, and could be illustrated with more and better figures and photographs.  This semi-pro photographer often found himself reading a procedure and saying, &quot;huh?&quot;  &quot;Change the f-stop which way?&quot;  The advanced photographer will gloss over reading the description of f-stops and shutter speeds while the novice will be left befuddled.  The book leans toward giving recipes for a situation rather than trying to teach an understanding of photography.<br />More explanation and pictures could be given of the equipment and  configuration.  A new underwater photographer with a camera is overwhelmed by the array of arms and attachments, but there is one paragraph on arms and brackets that basically says, &quot;Get the best,&quot; without as much as figure to show how one looks or attaches to the camera.  Then you get descriptions such as &quot;attach the strobe arm so it tilts toward the camera body.&quot;  Tilt in what plane?  What does a strobe arm look like?<br />There are statement and procedures that seem odd to an experienced photographer.  It is suggested that manual strobe exposure, which is typically only dependent of distance and f-stop, is also a function of subject brightness.  The procedure for using TTL flash starts with looking up the flash distance for a full-power manual flash to set the f-stop.  If you're going to do that, you might as well not use TTL (although this method does maximize depth of field, but, of course, this is not explained.)  The TTL electronics are then used as little more than a proper exposure indication, and if you don't get a proper exposure with your camera set to the edge of the exposure range, you're to burn more film at another f-stop until it works.<br />This books focuses on the Nikonos V and the now-discontinued RS.  Even though the author considers the IVA to be &quot;a dud,&quot; the III and IVA are still viable cameras that a beginner, the audience for this book, is likely to have because of the lower procurement cost.  (Currently on eBay, a V with 35mm lens runs about $475 while a IVA with the same lens is about  $250.)  An appendix on the features, and how operating and maintenance differ for these models, would be very useful.  Church has written on these models in previous editions, so it shouldn't be difficult.<br />So, what is good about this book?  The color photographs are very good, but are more of result examples than actually showing the equipment, but are inspirational.  The guidelines on positioning strobes and estimating distances is invaluable, as are the maintenance sections.  If you bought a used Nikonos without a manual, note that Craig Camera sells the manuals for a IVA for $20 while the book currently retails on-line for less than that.  If you're trying to decide between the two, I'd get this book.  This book also seems to be considered by many to be the definitive guide to Nikonos photography, and my search shows few, if any, other underwater photography books dedicated to this one line of cameras.  So, like the title says, even though I feel that there is a LOT of room for improvement, this book may be, indeed, essential for the Nikonos beginner.discontinued RS.

US	51389621	R1SAUHGU2JCFNG	1579804543	17626493	United States Navy Diving Manual, Revision 4	Books	4	6	6	N	N	For those with an insatiable thirst for diving.	Yes. I read this whole thing in the last week or so.<br />The U.S. Navy Diving Manual is probably the most complete single reference on diving based on the most extensive research and experience in the world.  Its five volumes discuss mixed-gas and oxygen rebreathers, no-decompression diving, open-circuit SCUBA (&quot;conventional&quot; SCUBA), surface-supplied air and mixed-gas (nitrox and heliox) diving, the diving environment, Navy dive procedures, physics, physiology and recompression chamber operation.<br />Unfortunately, the recreational diver, or even the tech diver, may not find much in here that they can apply to their own diving that they don't already know from the materials from their certification classes.  An open water diver will already have no-compression tables, and a tech diver will already already have decompression tables from air and mixed gas.  Also, the recreational SCUBA diver may be disappointed to find that the Navy (in my inference anyway, from reading this) eschews OC SCUBA in favor of surface-supplied except when surface-supplied is impractical.  You may also bog down reading the sections on Navy procedure.  (If recreational divers used these protocols, the number of crew and number of divers on a party dive boat would be reversed!)<br />A recreational diver looking for more information on recreational OC SCUBA beyond the superficial coverage of open water class materials might be better served by the PADI Encyclopedia of Recreational Diving.<br />However, the USN Diving Manual covers things that you won't see elsewhere, such as safe operating distances from SONAR and explosives!<br />I recommend this reference if you are like me - just curious about diving, how the military does it, and/or wants to have a complete reference library on diving.	2001-06-05

Although this book covers portraiture, it is probably not quite what I was looking for, but is good in its own right.<br />The book begins with the first section, &quot;The Well-Stocked Studio,&quot; and describes cameras, lighting, and accessories.  This is valuable information for a serious photographer wanting to get more advanced, but is overwhelmed at all of the equipment and what it does.  Other sections are &quot;Basic Portraiture,&quot; &quot;Corporate and Industrial Shots,&quot; &quot;Product Shots and Still Lifes,&quot; and &quot;Specialized Techniques.&quot;  Each section presents about a dozen different examples of techniques in that area, detailing the equipment used.  Each technique example is covered in a few pages with excellent photographs, a pretty good diagram of the lighting arragement, and an &quot;ingredients&quot; list.  The book is also sprinkled with valuable side notes.<br />To duplicate every example in the book, the reader will need an extraordinarily extensive studio.  However, the book starts with simple techniques involving one or two lights and reflectors, and builds upon that.  Even the more extensive lighting techniques are helpful in developing your skill at visualizing how a scene should look and how you would choose lighting to achieve that look.  Moreover, the less advanced photographer could duplicate the techniques with a couple of battery-powered flashes, a couple of slaves, and using an umbrella, walls, or poster board as reflectors.<br />I tend to judge the value of a book by how quickly I read it versus its cost.  Unlike &quot;The Photographer's Guide to Using Light,&quot; which I read in a couple of hours and cost about as much, I found this book to have excellent value as far as the amount of information for the money.  You could probably not sit down in a day and go through this whole book.  In fact, I read a little at a time over a few months.<br />As for portraiture, I'm still looking for a book that specializes in portraiture technique.  Even though this book does have a section on it, it lacks information on actually posing the subjects.ver a few months.<br />As for portraiture, I'm still looking for a book that specializes in portraiture technique.

I say that the premise of most of the book is that the expanding universe and big bang theories point to the existence of God because they point to a beginning that required a &quot;prime mover,&quot; and cosmologists with antitheistic beliefs have tried repeatedly to disprove the expanding universe theory because a beginning to the universe would be &quot;philosophically repugnant&quot; (Arthur Eddington).  As a result, scientists made ad hoc modifications to otherwise elegant equations describing the universe.  For example, Einstein arbitrarily added a cosmological constant to his equations derived from general relativity solely to counteract the fact that his equations showed the universe to expand without end.  Later in life, he said that the addition of this constant was &quot;gravely detrimental to the formal beauty of the theory&quot; and stated that its addition was &quot;the greatest mistake of his life.&quot;  If Ross is presenting correct data, the argument for the continuously expanding universe seems well-made.<br />The first ten chapters are basically a history of the development of cosmological theories.  Even though I consider this the main premise of the book, there are additional chapters on &quot;Bibical Evidence for Long Creation Days&quot; and on the antropic principle.  I kind of glazed over at reading the first section, &quot;Roots of Cosmology.&quot;  I felt that Ross used philosophical terminology that required some familiarization with the field, and it could have been explained better.  On the other hand, I felt that the scientific discussions were over-simplified, and I would have liked to have seen more &quot;meat,&quot; but then, I am an engineering Ph.D.<br />I felt that Ross started out well arguing Biblical evidence for long creation days, but as he went on, the arguments became less convincing, and it tainted the whole point.  (But I have heard equally weak arguments, in my opinion, elsewhere for literal creation days.)<br />I found the typesetting of the book to be odd and distracting.  I had hoped that this newer printing, in a larger format, would take care of that, but the comically large print was just made larger to fill the space.  Section titles are all lower-case, and the &quot;tables&quot; are poorly formatted and difficult to differentiate from the text.  The figures are oversimplified and the equations poorly typeset (they couldn't extend a radical over the part of the equation that it should cover?  e.g., eqn. 5.1).<br />I think I found this book initially interesting because there seems to be a knee-jerk reaction among many of my fellow Christians for the wholesale rejection of the big bang theory, and the faith of this author is encouraged because those against the idea of an intelligent creator have conspired to disprove this theory.<br />Writing about origins can be a touchy subject - even just a book review.  I think this book is certainly worth reading by someone studying origins, but encourage such a student to not accept this book at face value in a vacuum, but to continue to study all of the other resources available.have heard equally weak arguments, in my opinion, elsewhere for literal creation days.)<br />I found the typesetting of the book to be odd and distracting.

The title says what it is - handbook on Kodak filters.  I got this book because I was interested in creating anaglyphs (the red/cyan 3D images that require the funky glasses to view) and was looking for the best filter combination.  Not only did this book provide what I was looking for, but it proved to be an interesting read in itself, and it broadened by understanding of filters.<br />The primary limitation of the book is that it gives technical data only for Kodak-manufactured filters.  It includes the colored filters, color correction filters, haze filters, UV filters, safelight filters and neutral density filters.  The first part of the book is chapters on various types of filters, and 40+ pages in the back contain transmission vs. wavelength data, both in tabular and graphical form, for all of the Kodak filters.  Other tables include spectral-transmittance bar charts, chromaticity diagrams and colorimetric data and a 4 page table to convert between density and percent transmittance.<br />I knew I was buying a book of tables, but was pleasantly surprised by the 90+ pages on filter descriptions, application and technical information.  Although a book such as Kodak's USING FILTERS may be an easier and more in-depth read, one can learn quite a bit about filters reading this handbook.  Some of the topics discussed are filter manufacturing, storage and handling, filter stability, and color temperature.<br />Although not for a beginning photographer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to an advanced amateur who wants to know more about filters and how to get the most from them.  Of course, pros, labs and scientists definitely should consider having this around.  I also felt that it was reasonably priced.	2001-04-23

In medium<br />format, you're still limited to using lenses provided by the<br />manufacturer of your camera, but if you move to large format, where<br />almost any lens can be used on any camera, things become really<br />convoluted.  In short, lens manufacturers give names to their designs<br />in much the same way that car manufacturers give names to their<br />products.<br />Kingslake provides a history that will help the<br />photographer unravel the advantages of different lens designs as well<br />as serve as an excellent resource to the classic lens collector.<br />Diagrams are provided for most significant lens designs up to the<br />1980's.  There are chapters on optical glass and lens attachments.  Be<br />warned that about a third of the 300+ pages are biographical sketches,<br />with portraits, of important figures in the development of the<br />photographic lens.  This may be of value to some, but less to others.<br />There is also a very useful, separate, index of lens names, and a<br />glossary of many of the technical terms used.

US	51389621	R2WL2I58IXRSFQ	039914563X	225323965	The Bear and the Dragon	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Most prolific use of the &quot;F-word&quot; since Blair Witch Project	I've read every Clancy novel - usually getting it for Christmas and reading it before New Years.  This one I started at Christmas and put down a while and didn't finish until April.  Does that say something about how it held my attention or just turned me off?  Maybe.<br />China has depleted all of its cash reserves and their bargaining with the US to gain favored nation status is not going well when a televised tragic incident in Beijing involving the Chinese police, the Vatican ambassador and an American-educated Chinese Baptist pastor brings the negotiations to a sudden end.  Meanwhile, Russia discovers a rich deposit of oil and gold in Siberia, not far from the Chinese border.  What are the Chinese to do?<br />It is typical Clancy.  It is a well-researched technopolitical thriller with cliche character development, but many interweaving subplots.  Throughout the series, we have watched, rather incredulously, the meteoric rise of Jack Ryan from history professor to the reluctant President of the United States.  Now we watch great hordes saved by incredible luck.  Don't get me wrong - I like the stories.  As far as Clancy books go, I'll rate this one somewhere in the middle.<br />The thing that completely turned me off, though, was the sex and language that contributed nothing to the story.  It seems that Clancy sprinkled the book with profanity just for the sake of inserting profanity, and did similarly with the awkwardly-written sex scenes.  Clancy should stick to writing about political exchange and weapons systems.<br />So the story was good, but the sex and language took away from my being able to enjoy this book, so this will probably be the last Clancy book that I read.	2001-04-05
US	51389621	R3VLCEE8B6ZNPX	0849913411	736499042	Love Must Be Tough	Books	4	95	118	N	N	Dobson was tough love before &quot;tough love&quot; was cliche.	This must be one of Dobson's most well-known books and for good reason.  First of all, it is NOT a book on child discipline - &quot;tough love&quot; is used so much in relation to child rearing that one might be led to think that, but Dobson was probably teaching on this topic long before the phrase became part of popular culture.  (Dobson does have excellent books on child rearing, too, though!)<br />This is a book on relationships, and how one must always maintain their dignity and confidence regardless of what the relationship throws his way, and how appeasement may force a relationship apart because lack of self-respect causes a lack of respect for you among others.<br />Although the bulk of the book talks primarily of divorce, separation, affairs and other marital problems, the principles apply to ALL relationships, and I, a never-married single adult, benefited greatly from it.  There is, in fact, one chapter, &quot;Loving Toughness for Singles&quot; which discusses applying the principles of the book to dating relationships.<br />The principles of this book need to be understood by everyone who desires to have healthy relationships.  And it would be better to understand them sooner than later, and have to apply the principles in an attempt to repair a broken relationship.	2001-03-16
US	51389621	R2UOBJH6GIFM51	0879857986	54919420	Kodak Professional Photoguide (6th edition)	Books	3	54	60	N	N	Some useful info, but not worth [the price].	When I received this book, I thumbed through it and set it aside to be buried by other things.  I think that was an indication of how not unexcited I was about the book.  It is intended to be carried as a reference, but didn't fit in my camera bag.  Got a new, larger, professional LowePro bag.  Didn't fit in there, either.<br />The book is supposed to be a &quot;professional&quot; photoguide, but much of the information provided would be so fundamental to a pro that a reference wouldn't be needed (e.g., how to use a light meter.).  Some topics seem to be too involved for a discussion in a pocket reference and then are neither succinct nor good.  Of course, references to film will soon be outdated, and the book didn't have data for Kodak Supra, which I use almost exclusively.  Of course, like most Kodak books (which are otherwise typically excellent) the film references are very Kodak-centric.<br />What is very good are the calculators - one gives you camera settings for unusual situations or ones in case your meter breaks.  Another gives filters to correct about any type of light for any type of film.  The depth-of-field calculators are useful when I'm shooting 4x5, but they chose to not include them for 35mm, stating that DOF scales are built into the lenses of most 35mm cameras.  However, with the rising quality and popularity of zoom lenses, this is a bad oversight, as most zooms do not have DOF scales.<br />The books does have some good information in it, but left with a sick feeling in my stomach.  That is the feeling I get when I feel as though I have wasted my money on something.  The cover says $29.95, and it's a few dollars cheaper on-line, but I still feel like I got way too little information for too much money.<br />There is a smaller, pocketable version that I haven't looked at yet.  Perhaps it retains the best info at a lower price, and in a size that fits in my camera bag.	2001-03-16

He has also confirmed the observations that I have made.  He does an excellent job of tackling a very difficult subject while doing it lovingly but without compromise of the Word of God.  I am thankful for an authority on scripture and orthodox Christianity to address these issues for me using the Word of God.<br />The book is admittedly somewhat academic-looking.  Almost every page exhibits footnotes.  But this is because MacArthur relies little on anecdotal evidence but primarily on the writings and speakings of the leaders of the charismatic movement themselves, and references every one.  And it is very eye-opening.<br />The book not only addressed my questions on the charismatic movement, but was also very educational about things such as the canonization of scripture, the revelation of the new testament age, and the history of the early church.<br />The latest movement among charismatics seems to be the appearance of self-proclaimed &quot;apostles&quot; who do not meet the definition of a new testament apostle, but seem to be given unusually great authority by local church bodies as if they were.  I hope that MacArthur addresses this issue more directly in a new edition.<br />This is solid Bible teaching that every believer needs to be aware of today.	2001-03-14

My tendency in reviewing is to focus on the negative, so let me make it clear up front that I really enjoyed the book and found it hard to put down.  I am not really that much of a history buff, so to say that I enjoyed it and learned a lot from it is great praise.  It fills in things that I missed or forgot in my formal education about the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the middle ages.<br />In short, the book is about how, when books were being destroyed all over Europe during the middle ages, Irish monasteries preserved the world's knowledge in their distant, hard-to-reach locations.<br />Unfortunately, I don't think it took 246 pages to say this.  The author drifts off onto topics that seem to bear little relevance to the premise of the book.  For example, he spends a lot of time talking about Augustine and quouting epic poetry.  As a consequence, I'm left with the feeling that the author was merely padding out the material to make it book-length.<br />I wish I could give half-stars.  The material on &quot;how the Irish saved civilization&quot; was at least four stars, but padding the book with fluff makes it lean toward three.  I'd give it three-and-a-half.	2001-02-08
US	51389621	R15HNPTWTYSW2Z	0817454225	433537622	The Photographer's Guide to Using Light	Books	3	15	17	N	N	Some useful information, but there are better references	I was looking for a book on portrait lighting, and a poster on a photographer web site suggested this book.<br />The book begins with a so-so discussion of metering and light color and then proceeds with examples of ambient light photography.  There really didn't seem much to gain from the ambient light discussion, and I quickly got the feeling that I was not getting my money's worth.  It appeared as though I was going to read the whole $20 book in 20 minutes.  But then you get into the section on artificial lighting, and the information becomes more valuable and substantial.  The diagrams showing the light placement was actually rather good, and some other books I've seen could benefit from such good figures.<br />However, there still wasn't a good discussion of what to look for in precise light placement for portrait photography. (E.g., move the light forward until the nose shadow hits the edge of the eye.)<br />In summary, I'd give the ambient light section 2 stars and the artificial light section, 4 stars, but there are better books on artificial lighting, for example, Jenni Bidner's THE LIGHTING COOKBOOK.  So I average and give the book 3.	2001-02-08
US	51389621	R1JDYVGP1U8JED	0240803434	995835891	Beyond the Zone System	Books	5	61	61	N	N	I don't often give 5 stars - Name is misleading	First of all, I rarely see a book to which I'd give five stars, but this certainly deserves them!  Besides that, the greatest praise I can give to a book it to make it as stained and tattered as my copy is!  This means I've carried it with me everywhere so I would have it to read every spare second I had.<br />I think the name of the book is misleading.  Had I known what this book was really about, I would have gotten it a long time ago.  The Zone System (the seminal reference is probably THE NEGATIVE by Ansel Adams) is fairly straightforward, and some authors hash is to death and try to make it more complicated than it is.  I thought this book was another &quot;make something simple more complicated&quot; books like that, but it's not.  It might better be called &quot;Sensitometry for Photographers.&quot;<br />It is a technical book on sensitometry - characterizing how photographic film and paper respond to exposure and development - and how to use that information to your benefit.  It answers questions I've been asking for a long time, such as, &quot;How is the ISO speed determined for film,&quot; and, &quot;Why do B&amp;W photographers rate their film at a speed lower than ISO?&quot;<br />The book eventually does describe the Zone System and explains technically what it is doing, but doesn't try to complicate the system.  The book discusses how the light meter determines exposure, and how to make a densitometer from a spot meter.  It also introduces a simple and handy &quot;incident zone system&quot; using an incident meter that provides good exposure without a well-developed sense of visualization on the part of the photographer.<br />Be warned: This book IS technical in nature and involves a lot of graphs.  Even though the author attempts to allay your math fears, reviews math principles and even goes in gross detail on technical drawing and graphing techniques, if reconciling your checkbook sends shivers down your spine, you're probably not going to make it very far through this book.  (However, it's a joy to engineer-photographers such as myself tired of physical principles being oversimplified in other sources.)<br />Although the book is directed mainly toward large-format sheet-film photographers who can develop individual exposures independently, I think that any serious amateur or professional photographer would benefit from reading this book to understand the interaction of light, film and paper, and how to get the best from your materials.  Many of the principles and procedures can be applied, at least in part, to roll films to ensure good exposure.ry far through this book.

However, it is a fine overview of the portrait business in general, and I recommend it for someone intending to enter the business.  It contains discussions on selling, dealing with the customers, and the studio environment, and discusses different types of portraiture, such as glamour, wedding and corporate.<br />There was one chapter on lighting techniques, but wasn't as in depth as I would have liked.  Moreover, methods were discussed and not demonstrated explicitly in the accompanying photos.  Main light patterns such as closed loop, open loop, butterfly and broad are discussed without giving photos showing what they are.  I still have little idea what they are.<br />Similarly, the chapter on equipment actually contained very few photographs portraying the equipment discussed.<br />The lack of &quot;technical&quot; photos demonstrating the equipment and technique is very uncharacteristic of Kodak's books.  It seems that they included a collection of portrait photographs, sprinkled throughout the book, often having little connection with the subject discussed. However, this book also has much less of the &quot;Kodak advertising&quot; that their other books suffer from.<br />I felt that this book, overall, was rather good for what is was supposed to be.  My criticisms are small and hopefully would be taken as suggestions to improve the next printing.  Someone actually wanting to start a portrait business will require deeper technical knowledge than that provided here.  I will be reading &quot;The Lighting Cookbook&quot; by Jenni Bidner to pursue this knowledge.  I still haven't found anything that discusses posing, though.	2000-12-19

I personally won't be mixing my own developers in the near future, but found the book helpful in choosing my own film and developer  from those commercially available.  The margin notes are full of  informative tidbits (such as the suggestion that tabular grain films only  benefit the profit margin of the manufacturers.)  The bulk of the book  discusses developers, but also includes a chapter on other chemicals, such  as stop and fixer.  I will, in fact, probably try using the alkaline fixer  in the near future.<br />A background in chemistry would be helpful, but not  necessary, but without it, you may glaze over a bit in places.<br />My biggest  criticism with this book is its complete lack of figures.  A photo  demonstrating grain and acutance like Adams includes in &quot;The  Negative&quot; would be helpful, as well as density curves indicating the  effects of different developers.  Because of this ommision, I would  recommend that someone read &quot;The Negative&quot; before reading this  book to fill in the gaps.	2000-07-07

I discovered a  myriad of books purporting to be the one complete guide to photography.  Some were as fun as, and laid out like, a dictionary - a disjointed  collection of topics.  Some were too technical.  Some were too fluffy, and  were little more than a collection of the author's photographs.  I was  looking for a book that was complete, fun, and just technical enough.  After all, to get good photographs with an adjustable camera, you must know  something about f-stops, shutter speeds, depth-of-field, etc.<br />When I  picked up this book, I knew that I found exactly what I was looking for.  The book is well-written, and is profusely illustrated with color photos  that not only show the results of photographic techniques, but also  illustrate the techniques themselves, such as loading the camera.  I found  the book so engaging that I had a difficult time putting it down even  though there was nothing new to me that I hadn't glean over years of  reading about, and practicing, photography.  It was fun to just look at the  pictures.  Had I had this book when I began, I would have known much more  much sooner.<br />I think my friend, Cathy, will enjoy it.  She can read the  parts right now that she needs to accomplish her purposes - proper exposure  and using a flash - but will probably look through the rest of the book  just to see the photos.<br />If there were one book I would get as someone  taking up photography as a hobby, this would be it.  From there, I would  get &quot;The Camera&quot; and &quot;The Print&quot; by Ansel Adams, and if  you want to complete the collection or do your own printing, &quot;The  Print.&quot;  Someone looking for even more technical information and/or  interested in large format photography, would be interested in &quot;View  Camera Technique&quot; by Leslie Stroebel.in large format photography, would be interested in &quot;View  Camera Technique&quot; by Leslie Stroebel.	2000-06-01
