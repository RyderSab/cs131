This is the book that (in its last chapter) documents with excruciating detail Dubya's arrest for cocaine possession and subsequent community service punishment...and how he got the records destroyed as governor by taking the unprecedent action of issuing a new driver's license to himself and essentially erasing himself as a person in Texas prior to that time.  Devastating and brilliant!	2003-02-13

That, however, was only a problem for me when I went looking for things I'd read and discovered the table of contents made no sense.  <br />On the other hand, the writing is conversational and detailed, thorough and startling.  This is one of those books \\"everybody should read,\\" because the information in it - particularly in the last third - is so incredibly critical to the fate and future of the human race.  <br />Calvin has done one of the best jobs I've seen of explaining how and why the Atlantic currents transport heat and salt - and what happens when they shut down, plunging the entire world into an ice age in as little as 3 to 12 years.  (This isn't a just a future threat - it's also an observation of times past.  Every ice age has started and ended in fewer than a dozen years!) <br />Calvin tells us in detail how Europe will be devastated by the next ice age, how our SUV usage today in North America is leading us right to it (and much sooner than most think), and - most amazingly - offers some specific suggestions about things that can be done to stop it (like daming up some fjiords in Greenland and dynamiting others).  <br />Along the way, we also get a completely new view of human evolution, based in the whiplash environment humans survived for the past 200,000 years.  <br />This book is brilliant, and I highly recommend it.  Just be sure to mark up the pages as you read them, because that's the only way you'll be able to find things later when you try to explain it to your friends (as you will want to do!).	2003-01-12

This is - regardless of your religious persuasion - one of the best books for helping children deal with and understand death and dying that has ever been written.  It's about the death of a child's grandfather - his going through \\"the great change,\\" and frames death in a way that is absolutely beautiful and meaningful.  Highly recommended for everybody, particularly those with children who are trying to make sense of the death of their elders.	2002-08-03

Even more amazing for me was the depth of the research the author put into it.  The scenes describing ancient Sumeria and Uruk and the gods of that time and the nature of the temples (from the statuary to the costumes to the traditions) are impeccably accurate.  On digging through the book carefully, I find that all of the words attributed to the female deity he meets in space are the (few) actual words put in a female \\"voice of God\\" in the Bible (mostly Song of Songs, but other places, too), and all the words of Joshua are verbatim from the Gospel of Thomas.  It's an amazing dip into the esoteric history of the Jewish/Christian tradition...and its predecessors...as well as a fun read.  Just the info on mysticism is worth the price of the book.  Enjoy!	2002-06-24

Kevin Danaher has pulled together a brilliant collection of essays on globalization and corporations-run-amok that makes for a fascinating, insightful, and broad overview of the situation from several different perspectives.  Because there's no one author but, instead, 23 authors of 23 different standalone essays, you'll find notes, footnotes, and endnotes within the chapters themselves.  Some of the best authors in this field, including Noam Chomsky, Ralph Nader, David Korten, and Jerry Mander are represented in this book.  Although this book doesn't get into politics at all but limits itself to corporate misdeeds and structural problems that allow for same, it does offer in some chapters solutions to these problems that would warm the heart of any truly concerned politician from Barry Goldwater to Ted Kennedy.  As you actually read this book, you discover it's not a left-right discussion, but a human-corporate one. Fascinating reading!	2001-11-06

It's about how the &quot;white culture&quot; (really referred to by Forbes as &quot;European culture&quot;) is predatory and planet-destructive, not how white &quot;people&quot; are.  This book is brilliant and insightful, a clean revisiting of the history of the Americas from the point of view of indigenous peoples, and not at all racist.  Highly recommended!	2001-10-25

Originates and What You Can Do	Books	5	71	80	N	N	An insightful, humane perspective	The ADHD world seems to have split into several definable camps -- the neo-Darwinist doomsayers like Barkley who say flat-out that ADD is &quot;of no value whatsoever&quot; and is purely a sickness; the deniers like  Breggin and Rush Limbaugh who think it's a conspiracy by doctors or  liberals; the geneticists like Comings who suggest ADDers shouldn't breed  to keep from contaminating our gene-pool; and those like Lucy Jo Pallidino  who consider it a &quot;context disorder,&quot; a collection of traits that  may be useful in some times and places but is generally not a good match  for the way our schools are currently set up (I consider myself in this  category).<br />   Now comes Gabor Mate, an insightful, no-nonsense, and  thoroughly compassionate physician who provides an overview of all these  perspectives and comes to the marvelously humane conclusion that ADD/ADHD  is neither nature (genetics) nor nurture (parenting/environment) but,  rather, the result of the collision of a predisposing nature with an  ADD-hostile life situation, family, school, or job.  How refreshing!<br />    Gabor Mate has made a valuable contribution to the ADD/ADHD world, and this  book not only offers thoughts on what it is and where it came from, but  also is chock full of useful, real-world solutions for the problems people  with ADD confront in a world increasingly run by bureaucrats and  farmers.<br />   Highly recommended!<br />   --Thom Hartmann	2000-05-27
