Theirs was an unabashedly commercial venture, and the artists collaborated to create and sell works as quickly and cheaply as possible.  Dismissed as \\"motel art\\" at the time, these intense, lush and at times otherworldly depictions of an idealized Florida have become a subject of renewed interest and critical attention in recent years.  Consequently, many myths and vague tales have grown up around the group. <br /> <br />As part of his research, author Gary Monroe interviewed many of the remaining artists to bring the story to life, presented here in a 26-page annotated essay.   In analyzing the art, he insists that the speed with which they worked was far from a detriment: \\"By unintentionally bastardizing the canonical pictorial strategies...they created a new form of fantasy landscape painting.\\"   The artists found their strength as colorists, and the emotional hues capture the essence of Florida (or at least, as we imagine it.)  <br /> <br />As a northerner who visited Florida twice as a child in the pre-Disney days, I must confess that the 63 glorious full-color reproductions here gave me goose bumps of fond memory, real or imagined.  <br /> <br />A followup: This book launched an explosion of interest in The Highwaymen. Surviving members no longer need hawk their wares, since collectors now come to them and new works sell for as much as $18,000.

But the African American community developed differently in Indianapolis than in places farther north. Indianapolis already had a sizable black community during its formative years, making African Americans an integral part of the city-building process even though they occupied different strata within the city.  When compared to other African American communities in neighboring states, they routinely outpaced them in quality of life measures such as educational advancement and home ownership. <br /> <br />The author argues that this investment in the city's political economy caused the black community to protect the status quo, eschewing violent protest and mass demonstrations when white civic leaders started to increase segregation measures shortly after WWI. (For example, Indianapolis had integrated secondary schools until 1927, when the school board created an all-black high school.) They instead chose forms of\\"polite protest,\\"  such as negotiation and coalition building.  <br /> <br />The author examines five examples of this \\"polite protest,\\" ranging from high school basketball to housing and work opportunities. He concludes that while the African American community did manage to hold some ground, they were unable to increase their fortunes once the wall of segregation was securely established. As he states, \\"...I am not dismissive of the protest strategies...but I remain critical of their choices...\\" <br /> <br />Clearly and concisely written , this book is an important contribution to urban studies.	2005-09-07

To my way of thinking, life has given them everything - good educations, good jobs, nice homes, nice families, nice prospects -  yet they invest an inordinate amount of energy being angry at and fearful of THEM. (\\"THEM\\" being pretty much anyone who is not white.) Why, I've wondered, are my near and dear so aggravated by THEM when in truth, the enemy more likely to undermine their peace and prosperity is a white CEO? Why do right-wing talk show hosts wax rabid on the topic of \\"welfare queens\\" yet turn a blind eye to (or worse, make excuses for) corporate looters?      Of course, the answer if far too complex to address here, but Melanie Bush provides interesting insights, not the least of which is the basic presumption of \\"white goodness.\\"  Bush spent five years collecting and documenting perspectives of white students on inequality and found their perceptions of and rationalizations about equality have little basis in reality. Simply put: despite indisputable evidence to the contrary, most white students believe that not only have other races achieved equality, they are now privileged at the expense of white people. (aka \\"reverse discrimination.\\")     The first part of the book analyses the ethnographical data collected through interviews and surveys with students at the City University of New York (CUNY) probing attitudes and perspectives about race and class. The final chapter explores \\"Cracks in the Wall of Whiteness\\" and presents some consciousness raising activities...a hopeful chapter without which the book would not be complete. The Afterword provides a post 9/11 perspective on notions of race, and had me vigorously nodding in agreement at every page.    This book is clearly written and enlightening.	2005-08-24

There are currently six black companies, and black productions are regularly featured at the three Tony Award-winning regional theater companies.      Theodore Ward (1902 - 1983) mentored and encouraged many aspiring dramatists in Chicago from 1968 until his death. To honor Ward, and to aid black playwrights in the development and production of scripts, Columbia College Chicago established the Theodore Ward Prize for African American Playwriting in 1985. Only full-length plays addressing the African American are considered, and the playwright must be of African American descent. Since one of the goals is to uncover and identify new works, scripts which have received professional production are not eligible.    This anthology of prize-winning plays is the first in a series to be published every three years. Compiled and edited by Chuck Smith (currently Resident Director at Chicago's Goodman Theater, and affiliated with the prize for fifteen years) it presents  seven plays spanning nearly two decades, with diverse subject matter and treatments. Christopher Moore's \\"The Last Season\\" (First Prize 1987-88) immerses us in the final days of the Negro Leagues. The most recent offering, Shepsu Aakhu's \\"Kiwi Black\\" ( First Prize 2001-02) tells the story of adolescent son coming of age under the watchful eye of a tough-love father.     But my synopses can't possibly do these scripts justice. Highly recommended for any theater library!	2005-08-24

When he wrote the introduction to this book,  he had recorded over 125 conversations and still had \\"many , many more people with whom I would like to speak.\\"  Thirty-six of those conversations are presented here, with two more volumes planned to follow. <br /> <br />The interviews are conducted using the \\"participant observer\\" technique, and since Dr. Black  - a long time resident himself - is an \\"insider\\" these interviews are essentially honest,  intimate conversations among old friends, many of whom have now passed. As Dr. Black makes clear, this book is not intended to be a history of Black Chicago and its institutions, but rather a collection of oral memories from people who participated in shaping those institutions.  But his field work provides invaluable data for future researchers attempting to compile that history. <br /> <br />If this book contained nothing more than the biographical information about each of the 40 participants (some are joint interviews), it would make fascinating reading.  But the interviews bring each vividly to life. We meet people from all walks, including civil servants, educators, politicians, jazz musicians, railroad workers, business people, even two generations of South Side Chicago represented by mother and daughter Mildred Bowden and Hermene Hartman.  Some, like George Johnson, tell a story of \\"from rags to riches.\\"  Others fall into a category of \\"just keep on keepin' on.\\" <br /> <br />But all are riveting.  I look forward to the next two volumes!	2005-08-19

It's a tradition that was carried to the New World on slave ships, a tradition which enthralled, amused, repelled or even terrified white listeners...often simultaneously. <br /> <br />This book goes beyond the music created by enslaved Africans/African Americans (such as work songs and spirituals) to explore other forms of sound expression (including sermons, drumming, field hollers and storytelling) placed within a historical context to create a soundscape of African American slave life from the 1700's to the 1850's. <br /> <br />The written sources generally fall into two broad categories: the written observations  of whites (letters, journal entries, and newspaper articles by travelers, missionaries, even slave owners themselves) and the testimony of former slaves collected by the WPA Federal Writer's Project during the 1930's.   <br /> <br />With only three exceptions, the sound sources on the 18-track CD  are field recordings by John, Ruby and/or Alan Lomax from the late 1930's. By that point, the sounds had been \\"tainted\\" by pop culture (many are the times I have tracked down one of my father's rural childhood favorites from the 1920's, only to discover that this \\"old folk song\\" his grandma sang was actually an 1890's parlor tune) but alas, this is as close as we're going to get to listening in on a time which preceded sound reproduction devices. And as there are few things more frustrating than trying to understand sound by reading about it, the CD alone would be worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />The book is written in a nonlinear style, perhaps reflecting the subject matter which is itself quilt-like: slaves were constantly creating and recreating from the sound materials at hand, materials which often were not even recognized as such by white listeners. This nonlinear style could make the book a bit difficult to use for reference purposes, but fortunately it is well indexed. This fascinating soundscape is recommended for anyone interested in African American music in general, or the era of slavery in particular. <br /> <br />	2005-07-10

DuBois - pioneering sociologist, historian, professor, writer, editor, speaker, social activist, founding member of the NAACP and world traveler - has become an icon, and as such, rather unapproachable. Bonnie Hinman  brings his work, passions and even his doubts to life, making him real. <br /> <br />She also navigates deftly through the complex social history of the era, which during DuBois lifetime ranged from Reconstruction to the early 1960's. This is particularly commendable, as too often the Civil Rights Movement is simplistically portrayed  as all black people joining hands and marching forth as one unified voice. Without wandering off into confusing tangents, the book manages to capture the fact that \\"what was becoming the civil rights movement was born in fits and starts and changed along the way.\\" <br /> <br />Well illustrated with period paintings, photos and documents, the book includes a time line, source notes, bibliography, and selected web resources. Highly recommended for young adults and actually, even for adults who would like to get to know this great and complex man.	2005-06-01

The lead essay by curator Ruth Fine deftly navigates Bearden's multifaceted artistic and personal life, a collage inspired by a world of cultural influences from the rural lore of North Carolina to Buddhism.  <br /> <br />The breadth of the exhibition is exhaustive and stunning. Much of the art was loaned by private collections, and has rarely been viewed by the public. In addition to reproducing examples of his well-known collages, photostats and watercolors, it includes book illustrations, program covers,  paintings in oil and gouache, murals, costume designs, and his only known sculpture. It also compares Bearden's work with some of its possible influences; for example, Bearden's collage \\"Down Home, Also\\" (1971) and Picasso's \\"Sleeping Peasants\\" (1919) though of course, Bearden always makes the image his own. <br /> <br />In addition to Fine's essay, 244 color plates and 86 black-and-white illustrations, the book offers five additional essays which place Bearden's life and work in the wider history of American society and art.  For example, Jacqueline Francis' \\"Reading Bearden\\" explores what he read as well as what he wrote. <br /> <br />An indispensable book that finally puts all the pieces together.	2005-05-24

The recorded sounds documented here - which include popular music, ragtime, jazz, cabaret, classical, spoken word, politics, poetry, and more - are not merely \\"lost\\" in the sense that their existence has been uncelebrated. They are also in danger of being lost to us forever if immediate steps are not taken  to preserve the fragile materials upon which they live.  <br /> <br />Additionally, U.S. copyright laws have made it nearly impossible for anyone to reissue them as CDs. According to the author, there were approximately 800 recordings made by African Americans prior to 1920, the majority of which are still intact but half of which are owned by successor corporations like Sony and BMG who will neither reissue them nor allow anyone else to do so.  Which explains why the majority of this material ends up being released overseas.  <br /> <br />The book documents more than 40 artists chronologically, assessing their work and skillfully placing their biographies within the context of a complex and tumultuous era. It covers the famous (Bert Williams, Eubie Blake, Fisk Jubilee Singers) and a host of lesser-knows. The Discography provides a listing of CD reissues (if available) for each chapter, plus web sites where you'll most likely find them. <br /> <br />While seemingly an exhaustive tome, the author himself reminds us it's intended to stimulate preservation and future research: the final chapter \\"Miscellaneous Recordings\\" examines unissued recordings, \\"custom\\" noncommercial recordings, rumored but unconfirmed recordings, records by artists sometimes misidentified as black and more, in the hopes that future research will turn up more information. <br /> <br />Though massive at 656 pages, the book is highly readable and entertaining, very well organized and indexed making it easy to zoom in on particular aspects of interest. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the era of early recordingin general, or African American studies in particular, and feel no library shelf should be without it. It's a wonderful resource for interdisciplinary studies.	2005-04-03
US	48707622	RYOLT5DW5Q6Y9	1883982510	649627350	Point from which creation begins: The Black Artists' Group of St. Louis	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A fascinating microcosm of the Black Arts Movement	The Civil Rights Movement (and urban crisis) inspired African American artists to explore political and cultural issues through various experimental media including theater, visual arts, dance, poetry and jazz.  As artists created collectives in major urban centers like Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and New York,  this \\"Black Arts Movement\\"  (BAM) flourished from the mid-1960's through the 1970's.    St. Louis was home to one such collective, the Black Artists' Group (BAG) from 1968 to 1972.  BAG was not the best-known BAM collective, nor the longest lived. But a close examination of its intensely productive life is instructive as it uncovers the impact of racial dynamics, debates over civil rights, black nationalism, and the role of the arts in political and cultural struggles found any time social concern meets artistic innovation.     As the author states, \\"Although the critics' gaze has focused mostly on the coasts, a richer, more complex, and more problematic vision of the Black Arts Movement emerges when regional cooperatives such as BAG are brought back into the light.\\"  Consequently, the book is more than simply a role call of famous innovative artists nurtured by BAG (Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, and Emilio Cruz, to name but a few) as the author explores issues of controversy such as the recruitment of funding from white liberal sources...crucial to both BAG's founding and ultimately, its dissolution.  But dissolution was  simply another beginning as members moved on to play dominant roles in other spaces, both in the US and abroad.    The book is thoroughly researched and documented;  the author conducted over 50 interviews with BAG artists and others, transcripts of which now reside at the Missouri Historical Society (when permitted by the interviewee.) I appreciated Looker's clear and concise style - his prose flows naturally and is a joy to read. I would have liked more images of visual arts, but this is a minor criticism and perhaps not even a fair one, since I've no idea of what's available.  Additional resources include a discography of recordings led by BAG performers, 1970-73.    Highly recommended to anyone interested in the Black Arts Movement.	2005-03-22

Jones differs from the typical collector of world-class art in too many ways to enumerate. For one thing, he is not independently wealthy nor did he inherit a fortune - no, this son of a miner grew up in a work camp, and for most of his life, his \\"day job\\" has been public service. But he has brought to his collection - and therefore, to us -  a personal passion, curiosity and creativity unsurpassed by the likes of Guggenheim or Getty.  <br /> <br />The \\"dean of African American collectors,\\" Jones avoided trend buying and operated outside the more traditional acquisition modes. He occasionally purchased work he \\"did not understand by artists he did not know\\" because, in his words, \\"something in it drew me in...and I trusted it to take me somewhere...\\"  Buying from (at the time) relative unknowns, his purchase often paid the month's rent or put food on the table. <br /> <br />The result  of this 40 year commitment to African American artists is a magnificent panorama encompassing 1500 works by the likes of Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Lois Mailou Jones, Betye Saar and more than 60 others. This astounding collection has been donated to the University of Delaware's University Museum, and this book helps celebrate the first major exhibition of works drawn from it. <br /> <br />The book presents gorgeous reproductions of more than 100 works by 66 artists, with biographical information about them and also about Jones.  But it's not a mere exhibition catalog; it also presents ten thought-provoking essays which intentionally strive to \\"de-race\\" African American art, placing it within  the larger picture of the nation's history and cultural traditions. For example, Ikem Stanley Okoye's essay \\"Reign(ing) in Color: Toward a Wilder History of American Art\\" explores how the systematic use of color serves purposes other than surface appearance. <br /> <br />A magnificent book to celebrate a magnificent collection.	2005-02-24

Highly Recommended	I admire the gumption of Morgan Reynolds Publishing. Each year, as other publishers gin out yet another book about some popular hero, Morgan Reynolds tackles the unsung heroes with grace and clarity.  This new book about Bayard Rustin is a perfect example. <br /> <br />\\"Bayard who?\\" you're probably asking.  Ah...my point exactly. Rustin - grandson of a former slave - was a talented musician, writer, and committed activist, organizer and advisor who worked closely with such luminaries as Martin Luther King Jr. and A. Philip Randolph.  He is responsible for introducing Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest to many in the Civil Rights Movement, and was a backbone of the historic 1963 March on Washington. At the President's request, he counseled Lyndon Johnson on how best to handle the aftermath of King's assassination in 1968. In the 1980's, he counseled Lech  Walesa on the use of nonviolent resistance. <br /> <br />The reason you've probably never heard of him is because he was also gay. After being prosecuted for a homosexual encounter, he was deserted by many of the movement leaders. But he continued to work tirelessly and bravely behind the scenes, choosing obscurity for the sake of the movement. <br /> <br />Obviously, this is a complex topic for the young adult audience, but Miller respects their intelligence and handles his material deftly, without skirting the issues. The book includes a timeline, citations of sources, a bibliography, and related web sites.  It is also lavishly illustrated, with archival photos and artwork on about every fourth page. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-02-10

Griffler believes this is partly because historians have focused too much on the \\"Railroad\\" (with its mostly white conductors and stations) and not enough on the \\"Underground.\\"   Without diminishing the interracial aspects, Griffler documents how African American communities created and utilized a vast underground front-line network decades before there was much white involvement. As he states, \\"Even at its height the Underground Railroad did not entice African Americans to escape; rather, the loosely organized support operation was formed in response to the constant stream of fugitives.\\"    In addition to introducing black freedom fighters like John Parker (a former slave who built a prosperous business in Ripley, Ohio and worked from that base) Griffler crosschecks letters, reminiscences and oral histories against contemporary scholarship to explore the inner workings and attitudes of various participants and societies, providing a fascinating new perspective on things we thought we knew.     In less skilled hands, this book could have been an unwieldy tome, but Griffler packs a wallop in a slim volume. His writing is concise, his narrative smooth, and God bless him, he never belabors a point.  I easily rank this as my #1 book of the year, for general readers and academics alike.	2004-11-30

Believing that the \\"New Negro\\" would ultimately arise from black youth, W.E.B. Du Bois, Carter G. Woodson, Langston Hughes, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, and other major figures took an impassioned interest in the literary models offered to children.  <br /> <br />Smith explores the period's vigorous exchange about the nature and identity of black childhood and uncovers the networks of African American philosophers, community activists, schoolteachers, and literary artists who worked together to transmit black history and culture to the next generation. She also explores how various leaders forged bonds of cultural, economic and aesthetic solidarity even though they often disagreed over popular vs. elite constructions. This process is fascinating to watch, and is amply documented throughout the book with images and excerpts. <br /> <br />The book is lively and readable...not words I frequently associate with such an exhaustive study.  I particularly enjoyed the chapter about Carter G. Woodson's publishing house, which issued a dozen children's texts during the 1930's and 1940's.  I hope this book finds its way beyond the African American Studies bookshelves, as it deserves to be read by anyone interested in the evolution of American children's literature.	2004-11-08

The title of this book is a phrase used by Booker T. Washington to describe evenings in his slave childhood, when families sat around the fire discussing spiritual mysteries and paradoxes. These \\"prayer and praise hymns\\" (or \\"neo-spirituals, as Zora Neale Hurston called them) are born of such mysteries,  created by men and women of the rural South from approximately 1885 to 1925, navigating their way through the paradoxical time following emancipation, when they were no longer slaves, yet not really free. <br /> <br />This genre is not well known and, were it not for Dr. Walker's work, might have passed into obscurity. This awe-inspiring collection (originally published in three volumes under the same title) presents the music and lyrics for 24 songs, arranged for four part harmony. Each song includes an introduction, brief discussion of its Biblical basis, theological mooring, lyric and form analysis, and contemporary significance. <br /> <br />You can also experience this music on a CD of the same name.

It's obvious that he has traveled to the places about which he writes, and his experience is invaluable. The travel section of this book is the strongest and most complete; the part about tracking roots is really more of an introduction, and you'll need to supplement this book with others he recommends to do any serious geneology.

I like everything about this collection: the fact that it encompasses 52 stories covering over 27 years and a wide variety of content and styles; is gender balanced; presents works by both the famous and the lesser knowns beyond the actual boundaries of New York (plus lesser-known stories by the famous);  and its chronological arrangement that allows the era to \\"grow.\\"  With the help of the author's preface, I dove right into the stories not previously anthologized, like Mercedes Gilbert's hilarious \\"Why Adam Ate the Apple\\" (with the memorable line \\"He started to rave, and jes' raised Cain.\\") I was not disappointed.  Additional useful resources include a history of the era and a checklist of common issues, topics and plot components.

For example, the mere title of Peter Wood's &quot;Slave Labor Camps in Early America&quot; puts a new spin on our romanticised image of the genteel Plantation. Scott Sandage's &quot;A Marble House Divided&quot; explores the political life of the Lincoln Memorial as a &quot;memory site.&quot; Other essays focus a critical lens on specific episodes, such as the rise of Black radicalism in the South immediately following the Civil War, the voter registration movement in Florida 1919-1920, or intellectual pan-African feminism embodied by the first and second wives of Marcus Garvey. <br />  <br /> A thought provoking and much needed collection.	2004-07-20

For most people, the term &quot;folklore&quot; probably conjures the image of songs and stories, but as Daryl Cumber Dance illustrates, it's much more than that.

As one chapter is headed, it's about &quot;The Style of Soul.&quot; <br />Start at any topic that piques your interest, and I promise, you'll find it impossible to put this book down.

If you relax and &quot;go with the flow&quot; rather than expecting this book to read as you would wish, you will find it to be an astounding and seductive experience on several levels.<br />The viewpoint of this book is equally fluid; through some magic, Jones has you seeing life through the eyes of whatever character he's currently focused upon.  There are terrible, ugly, beautiful, sad, heartwarming things that happen constantly throughout this book and somehow, you are always identifying through the protagonist of the moment, whether this be a slave or a slave patroller, frightening as that might be.  There is no melodrama here. Somehow, everything is just taken for granted, assumed...it is, after all, their known world. And, for a brief time, ours as well. We eventually come to take it for granted.<br />We can look back with the smugness of time and condemn slavery and its consequential perverse social structurings. Yet a book like this makes one question our own &quot;known world,&quot; the social structures and cultural practices we take for granted and assume we are powerless to change. I wonder what our descendents will find equally perverse here...probably our oil addiction which forces us to attempt to control countries half-way around the world rather than simply learning to make do with less here at home.<br />Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com	2004-05-05

But then add the text, especially the contemporary accounts from Richard Wright, and you'll feel you've time travelled.  I've read about the Great Migration,  but this book lives it. <br />Chicago was the &quot;black capital&quot; in the 1940's, having supplanted Harlem as the center of black culture and nationalism. It was home to notables like Joe Lewis, Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, Ebony Magazine and Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. But the most arresting images and stories here are about the everyday people, ranging from grim images of the overcrowded slums to the more joyful life: a crowd watching the orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom, kids lined up in front of the movie theater, the Easter Parade outside Pilgrim Baptist. The book is divided into four parts: House &amp; Home, Work, Church, Going Out.<br />One of the original essays discusses the fact that during the time period, most white media images of blacks perpetuated negative stereotypes, while many black photographers strove to counter this with &quot;the strongest possible contrast to such representation.&quot;  Which makes this collection even more important in that it presents such a wide range of people and situations, without trying to support an agenda. The photographers simply captured life.<br />I agree: This book should be a part of every photography and African American history collection.<br />Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage.com	2004-05-03

There are 52 full-page illustrations, 38 of which are color. The book is organized alphabetically by artist, with an alphabetical index by titles. The narratives (usually a paragraph or two) provide interesting background about each piece; it's like having a docent along for the tour. The only drawback is there's very little in the way of biographical information, perhaps only a sentence at most.  So, this book is a wonderful supplement, but not a primer on African American art...then again, it's not intended to be. Instead, it is a celebration, a small taste of the masterworks owned by the American people. I feel it's significant these works are in a public collection for all to appreciate, and curator Gwen Everett has done an outstanding job in presenting them here.<br />Gerri Gribi, Curator: AfroAmericanHeritage.com	2004-04-28

Since the content of Tolle's books has been covered well elsewhere, I'd like to address the person new to Tolle and wondering where to begin.<br />In my personal experience, if I could only afford to purchase one book, I'd start with PRACTICING THE POWER OF NOW.  I feel that it essentially restates the material found in the original POWER OF NOW but in a format I found easier to digest. I don't see much point in owning both books (which I currently do.)<br />If you connect with PRACTICING and want more, then I'd recommend the audio book/retreat Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat With Eckhart Tolle. (It's less than $10 if you purchase the audio file from Audible.) I'm only half way through listening yet I constantly find myself thinking &quot;Ah...now I understand what he meant.&quot;  It truly is an excellent supplement.<br />There is one more Tolle book here, STILLNESS SPEAKS. I borrowed this from the library. It's basically just out-takes from the other books, sort of a quotable quotes book that restates things in a nutshell. It would make a nice gift to a Tolle fan, but again, doesn't offer anything more than the other books.  I suppose my message is: everything you need to know is in the original POWER OF NOW, stated perhaps more clearly in PRACTICING and excerpted in STILLNESS but supported well in audio format by the retreat CD. <br />I find Tolle's basic message very powerful, enlightening and simple. As he himself constantly repeats, he's not saying anything new...be here now.  But he explains it in a way which finally connects the dots for me. Unfortunately, this simple message seems to be getting constantly repackaged and I hope it doesn't turn into a &quot;Chicken Soup for the Enlightened Soul&quot; series. (I should probably go make sure that's not the title of an actual book! &lt;g&gt;)<br />Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com	2004-04-14

It presents a diverse array of Africana women, from those you'd expect (images of slavery, for example, or famous people like Oprah) to those that might surprise you; my favorite features two sportingly-dressed Nebraskan women at the turn of the century, smiling broadly as they hoist some trophy-sized fish. Such everyday images of black women just aren't part of our collective memory, and it's a delight to find them here.  Most of the images are half page, many are full page, making it useful for classrooms.<br />I'm withholding the fifth star because I'm not as thrilled with the text as I am with the images, and several places made me pause. For example, in a section about black women as mistresses to powerful white men, we find the Jefferson/Hemings story. The text says this:<br />\\"In 1998, DNA evidence proved that Jefferson most likely sired one, if not more, of Hemings's children.\\"<br />But the sidebar says this:<BR>\\" Although some people still debate the issue, DNA evidence has shown that a Jefferson - it could have been Thomas's brother - fathered at least one child by Hemings.\\"<br />One wonders why the sidebar vacillates by introducing \\"Thomas's brother\\" when even the research scholars at Monticello agree (as stated at their web site monticello.org):<br />\\"The DNA study, combined with multiple strands of currently                    available documentary and statistical evidence, indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings, and that he most likely was the father of all six of Sally Hemings's children appearing in Jefferson's records.\\"<br />But still, this is a wonderful book for libraries, as teachers will find it a useful supplement and students will find much to inspire projects and reports.

So I guess my point is: if you're unfamiliar with Tolle, this is not the place to start.

Familiar entertainment figures like Bernie Mac, Alicia Keys and Don Cheadle weigh in, with refreshingly candid interviews not commonly found in Hollywood hype.  We meet activists on the front lines, like Lenora Fulani who uses theater to teach kids how to succeed in business. And we meet everyday people like Dierdre and Jerald Wolff who joined the new Southern Migration by moving to an affluent, predominantly black community in Atlanta, and Lura and Chris, a biracial couple living in Birmingham..<br />I'm always impressed with Gate's ability to capture his subject's words without imposing his personality...he shares his own story in the introduction.

I'm rating this book as a historian and African American Studies resources specialist rather than as someone using it in worship. With that in mind, let me say I have yet to &quot;stump&quot; this hymnal.  No matter what song comes to my mind, there it is in the index.  Citations regarding authorship &amp; copyright are thorough, the introductory essays informative, and the &quot;Index of Composers, Authors and Sources&quot; invaluable.  The only other book which even compares is Songs of Zion, first published by the United Methodist Church in 1981.

It's like a scrapbook jammed with \\"rent party\\" tickets, dinner programs, book covers, letters, playbills, song lyrics and more. There is something here to capture the interest of even reluctant readers.<br />But the text also shines. The story of how and why Harlem came to be is told clearly and without mincing words: we learn the glorious achievements in art, music, theater, literature and just plain survival, but we also learn of the racism haunting the era,  and the infighting within the Black community itself. I think readers will appreciate this honest, realistic approach, which brings the era to life.<br />By the way, given the graphic beauty of this book, the price is a steal!	2004-03-03

It's both a travel guide and a reference for anyone wanting to learn more about the Civil Rights Movement. But it's not limited to modern times; like many historians, the author takes the view that the struggle for civil rights began the moment the first enslaved African set foot on these shores and tried to break free.  And it continued anywhere that people fought for dignity and equality. <br />Consequently, the sites described here include sites of slave rebellions, legal battles, Underground Railroad safe houses, historically black colleges, churches, museums...even the minor league stadium in Florida where Jackie Robinson broke through the color line.<br />I particularly enjoyed the author's honest and opinionated style.  Black history has been overshadowed by white interpretation for a very long time, even in locations where the majority population was black. Visit a Southern plantation and you will learn about the lifestyle of the owners, but very little about the slaves who made that lifestyle possible. You may ogle the beautiful handcrafted furniture, yet never be told that a black artisan created it.  He notes that much depends on which particular docent you end up with. Regarding Monticello, he says \\"...some guides more comfortable with the old Jefferson story of his inventions and quirks acknowledge the Hemings affair in clipped tones. Others discuss it volubly.\\"<br />The National Park Service is among those working toward a more inclusive interpretation of their historic sites, and Carrier tells us when changes are planned. He provides web sites for further study. He also writes about planned memorials. <br />Women are equally represented here. For example, he notes that the Montgomery bus boycott was Jo Ann Robinson's brainchild and that a \\"reluctant\\" Martin Luther King Jr. was brought in to head the movement the day after the Women's Political Caucus had distributed leaflets to every business andchurch in town. He also notes that despite black women's long history of struggle for civil rights, the male leadership refused to allow any to speak at the 1963 March on Washington...in fact, Coretta King and other wives weren't wasn't even allowed to march with their husbands.  \\"...after all their work and sacrifice, deliberate rebuff by male activists was unforgivable\\" he says.<br />A book that belongs in every high school library!	2004-02-27

Out of context one would think, &quot;Oh, what a lovely setting.&quot; In context, this grove is near the monument for &quot;The Port of No Return,&quot; a monument at the coast in Ouidah symbolising the largest deportation known to man.  This is an unusual approach, and the authors obviously have a deep respect for the people and the land.

Several years back I was watching a documentary on Harriet Tubman in which one of her relatives was interviewed. I suddenly realized I had never thought of Tubman as a real person, with actual living relatives! Her legend looms so much larger than life that she hovers somewhere in the realm of Paul Bunyan.<br />This book begins with a traditional biography, presenting the bare bones of Tubman's life.  The section called &quot;Stories and Sayings&quot; puts meat on those bones, breathing life into someone who has nearly been lost to us in legend. It's a fascinating concept, and I think it works.<br />Equally amazing is the Documents section, reflecting 10 years of research and which will be required reading for any future Tubman scholars because, as Humez herself says, &quot;...my retelling of her life story cannot be definitive.&quot;  Highly recommended.<br />Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com	2004-02-12

But I'm giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because it does not take advantage of the most current research in the field and at times, recycles myths which have been debunked...for example, the myth that there was a $40,000 bounty on Tubman's head.<br />Still, it does update much of what we learned about Tubman in our children's books, so I can recommend it to general readers.

She does not seem real flesh and blood to us. Larson sets out to rectify this, and does so admirably. She spent years combing through primary sources such as court records and private letters to recreate for us a Harriet Tubman who lives and breathes. There's even a family tree.<br />Along the way, some treasured myths are debunked. For example, there was never a $40,000 bounty on her head. Nor (as every school child can quote) did she make 19 trips and rescue 300 people; it's closer to 13 trips and 70 people, and she perhaps provided aid and instructions to another 50.  None of which diminishes her heroism, of course. It simply makes her more accessible as a human being by setting the record straight. And what Larson adds to the record far outweighs what she takes away.<br />This book can be challenging to read at times, because rather than stating her own conclusions as fact (e.g.Tubman's birth date, which she places in February or March of 1822)  Larson sometimes presents several possibilities and provides evidence to support each; we are left to draw our own conclusions. But this provides groundwork for future researchers and, I feel, is a more honest than presuming finality where none is present.<br />The Publisher's Weekly review above mentions competition from Catherine Clinton's Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom.  While the narrative style of the Clinton book is probably more accessible to a casual reader,  the book relies heavily on secondary sources, repeating some of the very myths debunked in Larson's book. But overall, it does take advantage of modern scholarship and is therefore an improvement upon previous adult biographies. If you want a quick and easy read, the Clinton book is a good choice.<br />If you want a book that is solidly and originally researched, then Larson is the only way to go.<br />Curator, AfroAmericanHeritage dot com	2004-01-01

Boyd is an excellent storyteller, and her narrative seamlessly weaves together Hurston's personal and professional life and work. There are surprises and revelations around every corner...for example, the author says that according to Alan Lomax, the most famous picture of Hurston (big floppy hat, head tossed back in a toothy grin) is actually not her at all. But the book is also fascinating for what it reveals about the Harlem Renaissance in general. <br />Hurston was a complex character, born long before her time. Some might question her choices in life; I for one am glad Boyd refrains from judging her. She just tells the story and allows readers to draw their own conclusions.<br />This is the first book in a very long time which captivated me until the very last word. Highly recommended.	2003-12-03

I've read this book and 2 others from Morgan Reynolds (William Grant Still and Thurgood Marshall) and I'm delighted to see that while the accomplishments of these great Americans are presented accurately, they also come off sounding like real people, not icons. For example, when Brooks visited the White House for the first time, she wore an elegant evening gown, unaware that guests would be dressed casually.  Embarrassed, she left early (before the President) committing another faux pas. Mixing that story in with her vast accomplishments would have been very heartening to me as an insecure teenager!<br />Racial issues within the black community are also clearly addressed. Too often it's presumed that \\"all black people think alike\\" and these books clearly present some of the range and variety of opinion their subjects encountered during their lifetimes.	2003-09-30

It was reissued on the anniversary of his birth. Some of the essays I found most interesting discuss &quot;black music&quot; and the expectations placed upon a non-white composer to be &quot;ethnic.&quot;	2003-09-18
US	48707622	R3STJRYGQIJKKD	0684870657	661855894	Beyond the River: A True Story of the Underground Railroad	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Bringing heroes to life	As a child growing up in Cincinnati, I often heard vague stories about the Underground Railroad, about houses along the Ohio River's edge which had secret cellars and tunnels, about some of the men and women who worked to set the slaves free. In photographs, the freedom fighters appeared old and desiccated to my child's eye, making it difficult to imagine the heroic and dangerous lives they led. This book vividly brings those heroes to life in this &quot;War Before the War&quot; by focusing primarily on a tiny corner of the world (Ripley, Ohio) and an abolitionist leader, John Rankin. The research is so extensive that at times, one might feel bogged down by details but then again, it was those details (especially some of the cold, hard economic ones) which made the story so real and immediate, and demonstrated the power and control the Southern states had over the nation. For example, a major concern for slavers was the fact that every escaped slave represented a loss of &quot;capital&quot; and they wanted somebody to pay for that. So, when the Suspension Bridge was proposed across the Ohio River between Covington and Cincinnati, it was stipulated that the bridge's owners would be financially liable for any slaves using it as a means of escape. By the way, Cincinnati is the home of the soon-to-open National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.	2003-09-18

I was also amazed by the size, affluence and power of the &quot;Black elite,&quot; a group about which we hear very little.<br />I'm only giving 3 stars because I felt the book sorely needed  editing and grew repetitious. He frequently makes a statement, then restates it (slightly altered) shortly thereafter, sometimes within the same paragraph. e.g. In the chapter on fraternities he tells us at least three times that his alma mater, Princeton, had no fraternities - twice within 2 pages.<br />Like another reviewer, I was also confused by his insistence that membership in the elite is based upon a snobby checklist including light skin color, fraternal connections, etc. If that's the case, how did he become a member of the elite when, by his own (repeated) admissions, he lacks many of the items on the checklist?  Is he simply the exception proving the rule, or is he overreaching to prove a thesis?<br />He touches slightly on the accomplisments/contributions/influences of the Black upper class and I wish he'd spent more time on that, rather than simply rattling off names and quoting examples of snobbery. But I suppose this was intended as an expose and I will investigate some of the other books suggested by other reviewers.<br />An interesting read if, like me, you're unfamiliar with the topic, but I'd get it at the library.	2003-07-12

Shortly into their adventure, they rescued a small kitten from the muck on the shore, and &quot;Stinky&quot; ended up traveling 2000+ miles downriver with them, becoming the focal point of much of their travels.  <BR> <BR>What makes this book so charming is also what weakens it a bit...unlike most contemporary travel/adventure writers, Dorie and Lou obviously undertook this trip for the sheer adventure of it, not to race home and write a best seller. This is their authentic story, told by 74-year-old Dorie some 40 years later, drawing on memory...in fact, it doesn't appear that they even kept a journal. There is very little description of the places they visited, (though there are several photos) more about the daily hazards they faced, and Dorie apologizes for having long ago lost the names of people such as the tugboat captain who gave them a free ride for three days.<br />But the heart of the book is Stinky's story. If you're one who believes that cats wander into our lives when we need them most, you'll find this to be a very charming read.	2002-03-04

As one who has actually read the book, ... I highly recommend it.<br />Contrary to media frenzy and popular belief, the Oakland school board did not pass a resolution in 1996 requiring that Ebonics, or Black English, be taught in place of Standard English. It did, however, pass a resolution recognizing what linguists had known for years: that Ebonics, like Spanish or German, is not defective English but a valid linguistic system following precise rules of grammar. <br />It also recognized that while students speaking Ebonics need to learn Standard English to attain success in mainstream American society, to do so they must be treated with the same respect as any student who enters the classroom speaking a different language or dialect. (English as a Second Language) Instead, they are often dismissed as lazy or stupid.<br />This collection is a common-sense look at the the issue, and a must-read for anyone who loves language.	2002-01-20

It's a great concept, and long overdue. Unfortunately, Ms. Randall's writing doesn't measure up to her concept; she might have fared better had she written this as a third-person narrative rather than a diary, since the latter is a tricky device to master for a first novel.

To escape the philandering intentions of her master, and to try to win freedom for her children, Harriet Jacobs spent seven years hidden away in a garret over her grandmother's house, three feet high at its tallest point with almost no air or light, with only glimpses of her children to sustain her courage. Until the 1980's, this book was presumed by most scholars to be a work of fiction created by a white abolitionist, but Jean Yellin's groundbreaking research brought the real Harriet Jacobs to life. The book has been published several times since the 1960's, often in inexpensive paperback versions that are much cheaper than this edition (2000). However, I'd recommend either this edition (which includes the short slave narrative published by Harriet's brother John, A True Tale of Slavery) or an earlier edition edited by Yellin if you want the full historical background on the book itself.	2001-07-31

The media is obsessed with reporting what ails society, but that's really a selective viewpoint and being fed a daily diet of it is probably why so many folks are taking anti-depressants these days!  Tim Harper, on the other hand, focuses on ordinary people who perform wonderful acts of kindness, and their kindness influences others to do good as well...as evidenced by the update to Operation Santa in which an Illinois business adopted a school. Harper is a natural storyteller who gets his point across without being schmaltzy.  The folks featured here aren't Mother Teresa...more likely they're your neighbor. Or perhaps - after reading this book - even you. I think the world would be a different place if this book was required reading for every college's incoming freshman class.	2001-03-12
