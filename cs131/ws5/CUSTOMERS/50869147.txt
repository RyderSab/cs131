As a woman, I can whole-heartedly agree that nearly all of these ideas would send me on an orgasmic explosion if handled with love and care. If there is any guy out there who wants to know how to make a woman [orgasm], this book is for you.<br />One area that was left out of the book but is almost just as important is the romantic (not sexual) foreplay that gets us in the mood. I'm talking about the little things you can do to make me feel special like calling me in the middle of the day, going on a walk, holding my hand, picking a wildflower bouquet for me...	2002-04-24

This book clearly spells out tips and tricks for keeping the flame burning in your marriage. I don't like the term &quot;lust&quot; in this context but what the author says between the covers makes sense for heating it up between the covers.<br />My absolute favorite book on romantic ideas is The RoMANtic's Guide.	2001-04-19

In all those couples I have found at work, church, socially, etc. none of them have a &quot;strong-willed,dominant&quot; wife. These couples are in peace because the women respect the role of the husband in the relationship and the husbands love their wives so much, that in return that they never &quot;lord&quot; over them.<br />The submission model doesnt work if the husband is domineering and abuses his power. But it works beautifully if the husband is considerate, gentle and loving in his leadership.<br />I'd highly recommend another book: The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb. It helps men be that sensitive, caring leader.	2001-01-15

It appears to have been hastily written although there is certainly some very good material in the book. A small,  yet more useful book I have found is The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb.  It is full of great dating and relationship ideas and advice. Don't sweat  the small stuff in love is also helpful.	2000-07-28

Men and women are different. Some of the concepts explained are useful but overall the book is a little shallow on the &quot;how-to's&quot; of relating with the  opposite sex. An excellent book my girlfriend bought me is THE ROMANTIC'S  GUIDE. I guess it was a big hint from her.	2000-07-25

It actually gave some ideas for what to do on dates and how to  make dates fun, entertaining and a vehicle to get to know each other. <br />An  excellent book on different date ideas is THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE. I've used a  number of the dates described there and my girlfriend thinks I am the most  romantic guy on earth.	2000-07-09

Most men can understand  that women NEED to be romanced. Men don't have that need so they can't  imagine anyone else having that need. They believe it is a nice perk, like  a trip to London. <br />An outstanding book I recentely read on understanding  women's needs is &quot;The RoMANtic's Guide&quot;. Surprisingly it is  written by a guy but he seems to know a lot more about women than most  women (perhaps he really is a woman and uses a male pen name).	2000-07-09

I have  discovered in this book and The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb that in  order to succeed with women, you need to understand how to romance them. By  seeing how women respond to me know, I couldn't agree more. Buy both these  books!	2000-07-09

Any guy with half  a brain knows that the type of girl you want to marry and help raise your  children doesn't hang out at nightclubs. But, I realized that most guys who  have trouble meeting girls gravitate to those sort of places.<br />Anyway,  there were some excellent tips and techniques in the book. I have used this  book and THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE by Michael Webb and I have very successfully  dated a few beautiful women these last few months. They are calling ME back  for more dates.	2000-07-09

While dating might be a noble way to lead to marriage, the whole idea is  that you date to mate is ludicrious. I guess that explains why Dr. Gray has  been married so many times.<br />I think dating is more for having fun and  getting to know one another -- becoming great friends. Two books I recently  read that do a good job at giving excellent advice on dating are THE  ROMANTIC'S GUIDE and CREATIVE DATING.	2000-07-09

The RoMANtic's Guide did an outstanding job of giving  nuts and bolts tips and advice on ways you can put more romance into your  relationship. I recommend both books highly.

But for the most part, books rarely teach you &quot;how&quot; to communicate,  they just tell you that you should. I know I should tell my wife &quot;I  love you&quot; but I need help actually mouthing the words. <br />Fortunately,  I discovered two books this year that actually helps me to express my love  and devotion in my relationship. This book is excellent as well as The  Romantic's Guide: Hundreds of Creative Tips for a Lifetime of  Love.<br />Thanks you authors for helping me to communicate in a way that is  right and good.	2000-07-06
