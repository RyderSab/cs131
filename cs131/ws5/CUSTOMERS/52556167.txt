It's full of real world, practical advice that can be used by both first time job hunters and experienced professionals alike.  I especially like the section on what to do if you are laid off.  This is advice I have not been able to find anywhere else, and I appreciate the straightforwardness.  Work It! should be on any new grad's reading list!	2003-02-23
US	52556167	R2F798DA8EHUD2	0375413634	70225414	The Emperor of Ocean Park	Books	2	6	7	N	N	A bit on the torturous side	I usually don't go for the books with all the buzz; I prefer to find the unexpected treasures.  But in this case, the buzz was SO loud, and SO favorable that I picked up a copy.  If only I had stuck with my instincts.<BR>See, I have this theory.  A very well-respected, and by all accounts intelligent professor wants to write a treatise on race relations in America.  However, he fears that his opinions will be dismissed by the general public, and he will be seen as angry and racist--labels he has worked to avoid.  So instead, he hides his theories in a so-called mystery novel, and the public goes nuts.  He's the great American writer, and everyone goes to bed happy.<BR>Well, not this reader.  Not only is this novel ponderous and over written--it could be about 400 pages shorter and we'd still get the point--not a single character is sympathetic, or heck, even likeable.  Towards the end, you almost want Talcott's life to fall apart, because he is such a sniveling little toad that you want to punch him.  <BR>The Emperor of Ocean Park is not a myserty novel.  A mystery novel is a Ridley Pearson, a Conan Doyle, a carl Hiaasen.  This is not a mystery novel--it is a nonfiction tome in mystery clothing.<BR>I give the two stars to Carter's publicist and agent though--stellar job with the promotion.  If only some titles worthy of the praise could garner the attention this book received.	2002-07-27
US	52556167	RBD2TPT2ALKAF	0452283035	860729879	Frida	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Fascinating glimpse into the life of a fascinating woman	I had to keep reminding myself while I read this novel that it is a work of fiction, based on real events.  It is so well-written that it is difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction.  At times you feel bad for Frida, and her physical and emotional pain.  At other times, you simply want to slap her and tell her to snap out of it.  The narrator, her sister Cristina, actually deserves less sympathy.  She had a &quot;poor me, I'm the lowly sister of a genius&quot; act a little too down pat.  This was my first in-depth glimpse into the world of Frida Kahlo, and I will definitely read a true biography to learn more.  I recommend this for anyone who is interested in art, the life of an artist, or Mexican culture.  Overall it is a fascinating novel, and extremely evocative of a turbulent time, place, and person.	2002-04-06

It was a quiet, gentle novel that didn't require too much thought--you just cuddle up and enjoy the ride.  Yes, it is easy to predict the outcome of each individual story, but the pleaure of this book is watching the friendship between the women grow and develop, and watch how each women continues to care deeply for each of her friends while dealing with her own problems.  It is a testament to true friendship, and the bonds that women can form across miles, race, and age.  A perfect book to snuggle up with on a blustery afternoon.  I can't wait for more from Chiaverini!	2002-01-15

Shannon is a typical 20-something, trying to find her way in the world after a sheltered existence at college.  She has a pointless job, a loser boyfriend (and then another boyfriend who can't commit) and a frustrating (though not unloving) relationship with her parents. And everyone keeps asking her why she can't get her act together. What 20-something can't relate to that?  The book is incredibly well-written, very funny, and very true to today's generation.  I can't wait for more from Shannon Olsen!	2002-01-03

And this book does not disappoint.  You think you know where the plot is going, and then suddenly, she throws you for a loop that leads to a wild ride . . .and an unbelievable ending.  So she may take a few liberties with plausability, but that's part of the fun.  This is the first book in a trilogy that is worth reading in its entirety.  If you like her other books, you'll like this one as well.	2002-01-03

Livvy is a very sympathetic character.  You can almost feel her frustration and loneliness coming off the pages.  As a reader, you are torn between the two extremes: you want Livvy to fall in love with Ray and settle in to life on the farm, but at the same time you want her to return to Denver and follow her dream of being an archaeologist.  Her eventual decision is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as is the tragic end to her friendship with the two Japanese girls confined to a nearby internment camp.  My only complaint is that the end was somewhat hasty--I wanted to know more about Livvy's delivery and how her relationship with Ray grew.  But otherwise, it was a wonderful book.  I highly recommend it!	2002-01-03

And what would happen if we turned him in?  Hoffman explores this question in her trademark lyrical, magical prose, and as always, gives us a glimpse into the human psyche--warts and all.  In Hoffman's world, people follow their hearts, no matter how dire the consequences, and the characters of Blue Diary are no different.  There is not much suspense to this novel--Ethan Ford admits his crime in the very beginning--but the novel is not meant to be a mystery.  It's meant to be an exploration of what happens after the confession, and it does that admirably.  It brings up the question &quot;how well can you really know a person?&quot;  Looks can be deceiving, and the ones you think you know best are often the ones you know the least about.  Hoffman's writing is magical, and her descriptions of New England and Maryland in the summertime are among the most well written passages in the book.It may not be her best work (Here on Earth deserves that description) but it is a solid book, and well-worth the time.	2001-12-28
US	52556167	RFHPOEESDDUZQ	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	5	13	14	N	N	An important, thought-provoking book	I resisted this novel for a long time--a fictional account of a minor player of the Bible?  Sounded deadly dull to me.  But after many recommendations, I picked it up, and was pleasantly--incredibly--surprised.  This is one of the best books I've read this year.  I took a class on women in the Bible in college, and I only wish this book had been a part of it.  The Red Tent reminds you that the &quot;characters&quot; in the Bible were human--they were real people, with real dreams, real desires, and yes, real bodily functions.  Dinah's story is not a happy one, yet it is inspiring to see how she gathered the fortitude and courage to continue with her life in the face of unspeakable tragedy.  It is a profoundly anti-Christian/anti-Judaism book, but it's time people wake up and realize this is what it was like.  Christianity has not been around forever, and this shows what like was like before the birth of Christ.  The writing is wonderful, clear, and evocative, and reading this novel is time well spent.	2001-12-28

This is one of the best book's I've read in a while--I actually read it in one sitting.  When 15-year-old Dominick Pindle's father gets a beautiful divorcee pregnant, Dominick steals money from his mother to help his father's mistress--and inadvertantly causes the death of his mother.  The result is a poignant, fast-paced, and exceptionally well-written novel, that almost borders on a mystery.  The characters in this novel are human, perfectly flawed--and yet you still feel sympathy for them and want everyone to come out happy in the end. (Except for maybe the slimy Roget, the town sheriff who gets Dominick's mother pregnant.)  As Chris Bohjalian says on the back cover, you miss these characters when the book is done.  I highly recommend this book--and I can't wait for Searles' next novel!	2001-11-14
US	52556167	R3PR0E87CM79MX	0385502761	841891973	Look at Me	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Eerie and compelling	This book is incredibly eerie, especially in light of recent events.  I'm almost convinced that anyone wanting to understand the events of Sept. 11 should read this book, because it gives an insight into the mind of (albeit fictional) terrorist, and provides a plausible explanation as to why other parts of the world hate us so much.<BR>Even without that aspect though, this is still a fascinating book.  It explores the idea of identity in so many different ways: the model who loses her face in a car accident; the young girl who longs for a life of more adventure, and who changes her identity day to day with a little makeup and no glasses; the young boy who hangs around a crowd of older boys just so he won't be seen as &quot;sick&quot; anymore, the suburban parents who fill their homes with things and fancy cars and country club memberships, but who hide anger and despair behind their smiles, and the terrorist who takes on personas and leaves them behind like yesterday's newspaper.  It's scary to think that a person's identity can become a corporate entity--but Look At Me shows how that is happenening all around you, and makes you think &quot;How much of me is really a reflection of capitalism?&quot;<BR>Overall, extremely well written, and compelling.  My only gripe (and thus the 4 stars) is the ending.  It felt rushed; almost as if the author was on a deadline and had to finish right away.  Otherwise though, one of the best books of the year, and highly recommended.	2001-11-06
US	52556167	RQLIZFMOTNY1E	0316890197	50054076	The Evidence Against Her: A Novel	Books	4	8	9	N	N	An intense study of character	Not much happens in this book on the surface.  At first glance it seems like that is not the case: there are births, deaths, marriages, World War I, an outbreak of influenza.  But all of that activity plays a background role to the intricate workings of three families in a small Ohio town at the turn of the century--and everything that happens is leading up to one final act, providing motivation for that act.<BR>I found this to be primarily a novel of envy.  Every person in this book feels as if he/she is on the outside looking in.  Agnes Claytor envys Lily Butler, who envys her right back.  Catherine Claytor envys her daughter; in fact she envys anyone that takes the center of attention away from herself.  In many ways it reminded me of a Jane Austen novel of manners: so many people were so concerned about what others thought, and caught up in their own propriety, that no one really understood or got to know anyone else.  <BR>I did find the ending to be bit abrupt.  The back cover says that this is the first in a trilogy, so I'm thinking maybe this book was meant just as an introduction to these characters.  Overall, the writing is superb, and the characters are fascinating, and for the most part, likeable people.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-10-29

It outlines the basics, and gives good, sold guidelines for running a publicity campaign.  My only quibbles are that 1.) There seems to be very little room for creativity in Blanco's world and 2.) This book assumes a very large publicity budget.  Many publishers today do not have thousands to spend on fancy press materials, and must rely on other tools to get the job done.  Perhaps a future edition could contain more on internet PR and other ways to get publicity without spending big bucks.	2001-10-29

She delves into the world of the paranormal in this one though, which while it adds an interesting dimension, somehow makes the story a little strange and contrived.  But as in most of her novels, it's the characters and not the plot that keep you hooked.  All of the characters are multidimensional (you can always tell who will end up dead in the end, because they are the least interesting characters!) and you find yourself liking even the ones that your not sure are good guys are bad guys.  Final Target also marked the reappearance of Galen, the hit man/wolf sitter/security guard from The Search, which was a nice touch.  Overall a great novel, but as good as Face of Deception or And Then You Die . . .	2001-09-04

In this book, Gregory Summers, the detective from the also excellent The Lone Traveller, appears again, this time investigating a murder and an illegal immigrant smuggling ring. Summers is far from perfect, which make him all the more likeable. The novel begins with a late night phone call, and then goes back to several months earlier, allowing you to follow the case. You know someone is murdered . . .the question is who, and by whom. The plot twists and turns keep you guessing, and the events come together explosively at the end, making this a great read for anyone who likes Iris Johansen or Tami Hoag.	2001-09-04

When I was first given this book, I thought, &quot;Oh great, a book about The Plague.  How depressing.&quot;  To be honest, if it had not been lent to me, i probably would not have even picked it up.  But by the third page, I was hooked.  Not only is the story, about a small English village that tries to control the spread of The Plague, brought in by a bolt of fabric, by quarantining themselves, it is the story of a remarkable woman, Anna Frith.  Anna is a widow (her husband being killed before the Plague) who loses nearly everything-her children, her friends, her sanity-to this terrible disease.  While The Plague ravages her friends and neighbors, Anna does everything she can to save them, and completes feats (midwifery, iron mining) that she never thought hersef capable of.  The book is incredibly well written; Brooks uses the vernacular of the time to great effect, but in such a way that it seems completely normal.  It sounds cliched, but I truly could not put this book down.  A truly surprising delight; I recommend it for any fans of Anita Shreve (who gives an endorsement for the book.)	2001-08-01

I should have known; any book that opens with a beheading, and the victims heads being placed in the washer and dryer, is bound to be disgusting.  I guess I just had no idea how disgusting.  I'm not generally a squeamish person, but this was just over the top.  Not to mention the plot was thin; you know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and the eventual revelation was no big surprise.  I personally found Martin's writing to be overdone; his descriptions had the subtlety of a 2 by 4, and some were just plain bad.  The run on sentences and lack of commas just beg for a good editor.  If you are looking for some good psychological suspense, just get a Stephen King or an Iris Johansen novel; those are actually scary and mysterious, not just gross.	2001-08-01

This is the perfect book for a diehard Tony Stewart fan like myself.  It covers all of his races--the good, the not-so-good, and the downright ugly--but it also gives a little more insight into Tony the person. It is nice to finally see a book devoted to a new driver instead of the standard Jeff Gordon/Dale Earnhardt (although the latter is somewhat understandable now) fare that is offered up.  And unlike some of the other books out there, this one is substantial, and not just some 64-page biography regurgitating PR information.  You either love Tony Stewart or hate him, but this book is for both of those groups.  You may not come away being his biggest fan, but you'll definitely appreciate and respect him more as a driver, and realize what he brings to the sport.	2001-06-14

The day I finished this book I ran to the local store and picked up three more copies, and I've read them all already.  This is literally a book that you can't put down.  Each chapter is a cliffhanger in its own right, and you want to keep reading just to find out what happens next.  There are definitely parts of this where I was quite breathless, hoping that one of the characters (all of who are likeable and real) would survive whatever predicament they were in.  At one point, I thought I had figured out who the killer was, and my suspicions were almost confirmed, but then a plot twist I didn't even see coming changed everything, and made this book an even more thrilling mystery.  I can't wait to read even more of her books!	2001-06-07

However, I found some of it to just be a little pointless.  What was the purpose of the chapter about Alison's mother?  I seemed like it was just stuck in there to fill pages, and did not serve to illuminate the story at all.  However, I found all of the characters to be very well drawn (Miss Crabbe is one of the funniest characters I seen in a long time) and the book was a pleasant afternoon diversion.	2001-05-25

I had to force myself to turn out the light, or I would have stayed up all night reading it.  You have to keep reading chapter after chapter, because French keeps adding new twists into the story that make you question all of your own conclusions--the mark of a truly great mystery writer, if you ask me.  Now, maybe I'm just dense, but I had a hard time figuring out who the killer was.  I found all of the women to be likeable, and I was I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what they had in common that would attract this lunatic. All in all, this was a slightly scary, suspenseful, and fast paced thriller, that I highly recommend.  Actually, I recommend anything by Nicci French (Memory Game and Safe House are only available in the UK, but are worth the shipping costs.)	2001-05-08

They go on to live with their elderly grandparents, and experience among them juvenile deliquency, a stalker, and in the case of one, and all consuming fear of terrorism and bombing.  Sounds like the makings of a comedy troupe, doesn't it?  But that's exactly what the four McWilliams children do.  While the book is entertaining, it leaves many qestions unanswered.  Why are the comedy sketches so funny?  There are small hints about the set up, but no pieces of dialogue.  And the scenes they set don't sound all that funny.  I wanted to know who the stalker was.  Was it Sam McWilliams arch nemesis from childhood?  Or was it an admirer of Julia?  Plum &amp; Jaggers is an interesting examination of what happens to children when they are exposed to tragedy at such a young age, but it left a lot to be desired.	2001-05-01

I was at first drawn in by the title, but I soon began to like the characters.  While it was somewhat predictable at times, it was a very fun and heart warming read.  It's a great book to read when you feel like you've lost all faith in love and the general decency of people.

It is very sad; you can't decide which character is the worst off.  Mick, the gangly tomboy who is tryign to find some beauty in a harsh world, while also trying to deal with the problems of her family and the trials of growing up.  Dr. Copeland, the educated black doctor, bitter against the injustices shown his people.  Biff Brannon, the hardened restaurant owner, who shows signs of being a homosexual in a time when being a homosexual was not acceptable.  Jake Blount, the radical drifter, who talks and talks but no one listens.  And Mr. Singer, the deaf mute with a longing for his best friend, the only person who understands him.  All of these characters are fully drawn, and each one of them makes you care deeply for him/her, even though they are very hard to like.  You read on, wanting to know what happens to these people, and whether anyone finds happiness at all.  While the ending is not all that happy, the point is made.  Everyone is searching for something, whether it be beauty, like Mick, or understanding, like Mr. Singer.  And as the title says, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book.	2001-04-27

But as I got further into it, I realized that maybe that's the point.  None of these &quot;blondes&quot; cared about anyone but themselves, so why should we care for them?  I guess I just couldn't see the point.  Are we supposed to feel bad for, or identify with, wealthy New York social climbers with voracious appetites for sex, drugs, and Manolos?  Reading this book just made me feel content with my life, and glad that I did not live in a social world where appearance is everything and sex is used as a weapon and a tool.   Like most people, I picked this up because I enjoy &quot;Sex in the City,&quot; but I'll stick with Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte anyday.  At least they have at least a few likeable qualities.	2001-04-17

I realize that it does not claim to be great literature, but I think the characters could have had a little more dimension than they did.  I also wonder if the author has ever really been to LA, because the LA I know is not just movie stars and Armani suits.

I think it is the best Oprah pick yet.  I actually came home from workearly so I could curl up and finish this book.  I admit I could not completely understand why the rape had such a disastrous effect on the family, but that was the whole point.  Oates was showing that this family, that seemed to have this &quot;gift for happiness,&quot; this family that had everything going for it, was actually the definition of dysfunctional.  All it took was one incident to disturb that &quot;perfection.&quot;  I kept reading because i wanted to know what would happen.  Would Marianne ever be able to go home?  Would Patrick kill Zacahary Lundt?  Would Corrine ever get past her tunnel vision and see things as they really were?  Yes, it was depressing, but it was real.  There are families like the Mulvaneys all over America, whether we want to admit it or not.   Overall though, I thought this was a wonderful book, and I can't wait to read more Joyce Carol Oates.	2001-04-01

What I found was actually closer to Bridget than I thought in some sections.  However, Rosie is a stronger woman-she just doesn't know it yet.  Fielding's characterizations of the celebrities, as well as the relief workers, were well-rounded, and the action was fast paced.  But most of all, I never thought I would laugh out loud while reading about a famine.  The scenes where the celebrities first encounter the Africans are quite funny.  Later on though, while one celebrity is photographed holding a starving child, all I could picture was Sally Struthers wandering through the camps with tears in her eyes--and Fielding's point hit home.  Cause Celeb is an interesting statement on the place of celebrity in our society--and how it can actually be used for good, even if those doing the good are vile people.  I recommmend ths book.	2001-03-20
US	52556167	R3EJOFAJXWSH4P	0375506039	878470234	Open House	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The weakest Oprah pick yet	I usually count on Oprah to enlighten me on really good books that I might otherwise overlook.  In this case, I had read (and enjoyed) Elizabeth Berg before.  However, I found this book to be disappointing.  The characters lacked depth, and it was filled with far too many cliches.  The &quot;he left me so now I'll go charge stuff&quot; thing has been overdone, and David is just so annoying you wish you reach in and slap him.  I think Oprah must have been really stressed out when she picked this one, because it is much lighter than her other choices.  Try reading Berg's &quot;Durable Goods&quot; for a much better book.	2001-03-20

If you are looking for a fun, read in one sitting and laugh out loud, then you have found it.  This book was one of those &quot;Ohmygod, this is totally about me&quot; books.  How many of us haven't gone to the shops on a particularly bad day--just to browse--and come out with bags of things we don't really need?&quot;  Becky is a fun, real, character, and her predicament is not all that different from that of many other 25 years olds.  (Trust me, I know).  I loved her fantasies about how to earn more money, and the end is very sweet.  Plus, it gave me some ideas on how to avoid paying my credit card bills--who would have thought to date the check 2200?  :)  A great fun book, perfect for a day at the beach or a long plane trip.	2001-03-05

It's a fun novel, full of the usual girltalk over a curry and lots of shopping in trendy shops.  This book, about the wedding of an annoying ex-classmate to a rich bachelor, has many funny moments, and the characters are charming.  I especially enjoyed Mel's encounters with the over-large suitor.  If you are looking for a fun, frothy read, then this one is for you.	2001-03-05

There were certain sections that were suspenseful, but on the whole, it was a difficult novel to finish.  I found the constant switching between the points of view of Ambrose and William to the story in America, and then back to Harry to be confusing and misleading.  While some may consider this well-written, I thought that McGrath overdid a lot of his descriptions.  The characters were fully drawn, but I did not find any of them particularly likeable, with the exception of Sara Rind.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this book, which had a lot of potential to be a great story.	2001-03-04

Ciresi is an incredibly adept writer, but for some reason there just seemed to be too much of it.  I found it very hard to be sympathetic to Lisa--her reckless and self-destructive behavior was just plain annoying by the end.  However, it is an insightful glimpse at a 20-something during the 80's.  The front cover copy is misleading though, as it makes the book sound as if it about Lisa and her overbearing mother.  That is a part of the story, but not the most important part.  Overall, and enjoyable read.	2001-02-21

This book is incredibly subtle, but it packs a punch unlike any other book I have read in a long time.  It stays with you long after the last page--and when you reach the last page, you just want to go back and start all over again.  This was the first John Irving I had ever read, and I have to say, he has made me a fan.  You know the story--just buy the book.	2001-02-21

The book is interesting, but not essential reading for understanding the lives and psyches of girls.	2001-02-21

Santiago's descriptions of Puerto Rico really make you feel as if you are there; the sights, sounds, and especially the smells are brought to life with vivid detail.  Her description of her audition at the High School for the Performing Arts is both funny and heartbreaking.  If you are at all interested in an extraordinary woman or Puerto Rican culture, read this book.	2001-02-21

This is just as good as her other books (except for perhaps The Poisonwood Bible, which was in my opinion the pinnacle of her writing).   I very much enjoyed this book.  Not being of a scientific mind myself, I found that Kingsolver's writing made it interesting, and it was not too technical.  It was key to the development of the story, and far different than any other book out there. My only quibble with the book is that for some reason Kingsolver seems to be man bashing in this book.  All of the female characters are sensistive, strong, intelligent, and always right, while the male characters have a tendency to be bumbling idiots, oblivious to the nuances of nature, both human and wild.  I think I would have like to see more well-rounded characterization in that area, but otherwise, this is a fine work.	2001-01-08

The paintings are gorgeous, and each time you look at them you see a new meaning.  But most of all what I took away from this book is that we shouldn't be afraid to take a moment or two for ourselves and do the things we enjoy.  A must read for anyone who is stressed out, or just looking for a few moments of beauty.	2000-10-20

There are some great shots, especially of the early  days of the sport.  However, I found that the accompanying text wasn't as  informative as I would like; the content defintiely seems to have been  filtered by the &quot;NASCAR censors,&quot; as  there is nothing  controversial or that could possibly be interpreted as negative about the  sport.  I recommend Monte Dutton's AT SPEED:  Up Close and Personal with  the People Places and Fans of NASCAR if you are looking for a real, true,  warts-and-all view of America's favorite sport.  However, Mike Hembree's  book makes a pretty coffee table decoration, and is a nice tribute at the  beginning of a milennium.	2000-08-08

Simply Divine chronicles the adventures of yet another 20-something Brit facing job woes, singlehood, and annoying friends and non-friends.  I  laughed out loud at some parts-- I pictured Champagne D'Vyne as the body of  Pamela Lee with the voice of Fran Drescher.  To anyone who doesn't read  Vogue or Bazaar, the fashion name-dropping could get a little tiresome, but  for anyone at all connected with that world, it's great fun.  My only  complaint was that the ending was a little too convenient.  But that is  what makes this such a fun, perfect for a day at the beach.  Not too  complicated, not too serious, but loads of fun.	2000-05-31

As a NASCAR fan, I couldn't ask for more insightful, entertaining, and dead-on analysis of my favorite sport.  The author is honest in his assessments of NASCAR and its fans, tracks, and  notable personalities--he doesn't fear he will offend anyone, and calls 'em  like he sees 'em.  Compared to some of the other drivel that is out there  about NASCAR that does nothing but genuflect to owners and drivers, Dutton  pays no mind to the politics and focuses on the racing.  The result is an  often laugh out loud funny and very informative book. I especially enjoyed  the chapter on Adam Petty, the driver who was tragically killed recently.   The author's words of praise for the talented young driver were all the  more poignant.  Hopefully Monte Dutton will write many more books and keep  giving NASCAR fans what they want.	2000-05-25

I always read books thorugh even if I don't like them, but this one has been painful from the start.  I'm sad to say that I will not be finishing this  one, and that I will probably donate it to the public library.  Obviously  Baldacci's other books must be better, or we wouldn't be a bestselling  author.   I have found Saving Faith to be confusing, somewhat boring, and  lacking a hook to get me interested.  I'm about 50 pages into it and I  still don't know what the whole ting is about.  I think I'll stick to  Grisham for crime thrillers.	2000-05-25

It is very hard to say something that hasn't already been said . . .this book has been receiving accolades for nearly half a  century, and rightfully so.  As a fan of Jane Austen, I found myself  thinking throughout the book that if Jane were alive in the 1940's, this  was what she would have written.  It has everything--adventure, romance,  humor, and a little bit of philosophizing thrown in for good measure.  It  is one of those books that when you finish it, you find yourself sad that  it ended, and wanting to open it right back up and start again.  If you are  looking for a great rainy Sunday afternoon in front of the fire novel, a  great reading on the airplane novel, or a just plain great novel, pick this  up.

Two hours later I was still sitting there, and more than halfway through.  It is that good.  bruno Manz is completely honest about his experiences, and makes it easy to see how a young boy could be caught  up in a web of lies.  Growing up in America, we rarely learn about the  &quot;other&quot; side in WWII--the &quot;enemies.&quot; It is refreshing  and eye-pening to see what was really happening in Germany during that  time.  I recommend this for anyone studying WWII history, and for anyone  who wants a true and honest portrayal of what really happened.	2000-05-09

The sensuality of her descriptions captovated me, and I found myself transported to Chile and California in  its early days.  Contrary to other reviewers opinions, I found that the  characters were fascinating, and fully drawn.  I especially enjoyed  Paulina, the spoiled daughter turned shipping magnate/socialite.  I wanted  Eliza to find Joaquin, and breathlessly turned each page as she grew closer  to her target. yet I also found there were a few too many loose ends.  What  happened to Mama Fresia, and Mrs. Andieta?  Did Rose Sommers ever travel to  California?  Did John Sommers ever reunite with his daughter?  What about  Jacob Todd/Freemont--did his journalism career continue with success after  the death of his most compelling subject?  Did Tao Chi'en continue his  efforts with the singsong girls? I think this book screams sequel, because  the love between a Chilean and a Chinese is just too compelling to ignore,  and could be a novel in and of itself. Overall, Daughter of Fortune was a  fascinating and vivid read.  It has made me a fan of Isabel Allende's, and  if House of the Spirits is that much better, than I cannot wait.	2000-03-21

It was one of the few books that I've read that I actually laughed out loud.

I loved the beginning, with Natalie's quest to humiliate Mrs. Berry and discover why ews are not allowed to stay at the Inn. However, once Natalie groaws  up, I found the story to be, well, boring.  The characters are complete  stock types, with no originally.  (th overbearing ewish mother?   Puh-leeze.)  Besides, what are the chances that this girl would spend her  whole life trying to get back at this family?  And then end up marrying one  of the sons?  And of course, the evil family's whole life falls apart.  It  was so predictable-the mushroom scene, the French chef (although that was  pretty funny) and other scenes were very obvious.   I, like many of the  other reviewers, found it somewhat disturbing that all of the Jewish girls  end up marrying Gentile men.  Um, what's that all about?  Very  disappointing novel overall.	1999-08-10

Boy, was I disappointed.  Other than Lily, the characters are  stock.  (Although her parents did remind me somewhat of Mr. &amp; Mrs.  Bennett).  I found the writing frightfully poor at points.  I also found  the constant idolatry of NY a bit grating.  I have been to NY, and I didn't  find the people at all superior to those of Cleveland, or any other city  for that matter.  Overall?  A pleasant afternoon read, but if you're  looking for true romance, strong characters, and an all around entertaining  read, read Jane Austen instead.	1999-07-27

It reminds me of the Laura Ingalls books I enjoyed so much as a child, only with a rougher edge.

At first, I found it a little odd that a woman would just simply have sex with a man she only set eyes on once, but  as I read on, Alice's motives became more clear and the attraction to Adam  was understandable.  I found myself holding my breath in certain spots,  when Alice was about to be caught in her snooping.  Killing Me Softly is  like Bridget Jones meets Fatal Attraction.  Wonderful summer reading.	1999-06-30

I had the pleasure of meeting Leatrice recently and found her to be just as wonderful as her book.  The gorgeous color photographs are truly inspirational, and the color quiz provided some fabulous insights into my  &quot;color personality&quot; that I had never even thought of.  I highly  recommend this book for anyone!	1999-05-07

I was disappointed.   The character of Rae seems very  similar to March Murray in Here On Earth.  She's someone who got into an  obsessive relationship at a young age and was willing to throw everything  away for it.  Her boyfriend is very similar to Hollis.  It just seems like  the story of these two were the beginning outlines of Here On Earth, and  Hoffman decided to recycle them.  Here on Earth is a much better novel  though-you feel more for the charcaters and understand their passion.  You  just don't really care about these two. Some scenes in this book are  downright bizarre, and many seem unnecessary. I had a hard time forcing  myself to finish this book, because it bordered on boring.  read one of  Hoffman's other books for some great writing.	1999-01-25

This book was so predictable-I read in in a few hours while strnded at the airport.  I just  didn't feel anything for these characters, except for disbelief that they  could be so unrealistic.  Someone mentioned Lamb and Abby taking Vix in  even when Caitlin wasn't there.  That is so unrealistic.  This was a good  quick read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Read Otherwise KNown as  Sheila the Great or Are You There God it's Me Margaret if you really want  to be entertained. I must say though, that she did get the scenery right.   I grew up right across the way from the Vineyard, and the setting is dead  on. It was cool to read about places I knew.	1999-01-05

But thinking it over, I realize it does have some good points, and I give Lowenthal credit for trying.  I htink the thing that bothered me the  most was the overuse of metaphors-and bad ones at that.  The book is full  of them! I agree with the other reviewer in that it should have been  written in the first person.  The third person pov takes this intensely  personal story and makes it into a movie of the week sort of deal.  You  can't get into the characters heads, understand their motives.   I also  found the ending to be a little bit too neat and tidy.  After hundreds of  pages of arguments and strife, Jacob and Jonathan suddenly just patch  things up with hardly any discussion or adressing the issues between them.   Again, it's like a movie of the week. Lowenthal has a lot of potential-I  hope he realizes it on his next work.	1998-11-11
