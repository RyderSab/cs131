One of the most impressive and original movies I've seen for years, SIN CITY blew me away with its knowingly malicious nature, razor-edge script and frenetic action. To have such revolutionary geniuses like Miller and Quentin Tarintino collaborate on a film like this, it's more than welcome for American audiences looking for a non-traditional event that shakes the rule book, rips out all the pages and burns them. This behind the scenes tome, penned by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez is filled to the brim with all the essentials that make a great backstage look at the absorbing world of filmmaking. Containing the entire screenplay for Sin City, a widespread behind the scenes photo collection, cast and filmmakers feelings on the film, nicely presented publicity material for the marketing, and so much more. Lavishly presented and with enough info to satisfy the most ardent fan, what more could you want? This is indispensable material for any film fan, and a great value, it makes this even more appealing. If you don't already have this enthralling manuscript, buy it now!	2005-08-28

However noticeably absent are his thoughts on his career making turn as Dracula. But considering the hundreds of fantastic films he has acting in, it is of diminutive consequence. Like Sean Connery with 007, he was given fame by a role that he now wishes to distance himself from. Fair enough, considering films like The Wicker Man (One of Lee's favourites) and Sleepy Hollow altering people's perceptions of the actor. Regaling readers with his thorough tales of on-set antics while filming the James Bond film Man with the Golden Gun, working with Steven Spielberg on 1941, and working with directors like Tim Burton, Guy Hamilton, Terence Fisher, George Lucas and Peter Jackson. Lee warms to memories of his long time on-screen acting partner Peter Cushing and their work together. You realize just how important a role Lee has played in cinema history. And despite his numerous Dracula and monster roles (Which aren't that many despite critics waffling) he has displayed in recent years just how much range he can provide, from serious drama in Jinnah, Science Fiction with the Star Wars prequels and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. What a treat to have the master of movies take time to pen his thoughts. Without this book, there would be a large gap in history. This is a very welcome history lesson in Hollywood movie making, and leave s a lasting impression on readers who discover just how prolific an actor he is. Fantastic stuff.	2005-08-27

Author Tony Nourmand has clearly put a great amount of effort and research into the making of this book, and it shows. Beautifully presented, this has quickly turned out to be one of my preferred movie books. Showcasing classic posters from some of the leading graphic artists of the 1970s and 80s like Robert McGinnis (Live and Let Die and The Man with The Golden Gun are amazing), Bob Peak (Moonraker), Frank McCarthy, Renato Casaro and Randi Braun, their collective works culminate in a lavishly presented masterwork that looks fantastic. Footnotes on subtle changes that were made to some late 70s movie posters are particularly welcome, as are the informative and interesting introductions that accompany the film-based chapters. The Sean Connery films for instance, comprise extensive thoughts from Nourmand talking about discarded poster ideas and how the change of leading man from Connery to George Lazenby caused some marketing concerns. It's not difficult to see why some of the early posters like From Russia With Love are sought after by collectors, these highly prized masterpieces are worth thousands by today's market. Being a poster collector myself, I've found that this is a particularly lucrative hobby. Theses are not just your average, run of the mill images, these are works of art that look beautiful on the wall. Poster layouts for the Roger Moore era are the most elaborate, indicating the change in times, Britain and America's quickly changing tastes, and the myriad of factors that are involved in this particular art. Foreign posters from Japan and Spain display the differential takes on how these particular films should be marketed, and the changes that were made by more conservative global regions to the more sexually suggestive artwork. Reading it, one notices the gradual change from traditional watercolor artwork to photo mosaics and stylish computer-aided photography. Which is, arguably less impressive, but mostly, the posters for the new Pierce Brosnan films do carry on the subtle nuances and certain recognizable M.O that is so popular. This is must-have material for 007 fans and poster fans alike and inspiration for aspiring artists in the field of movies.artwork.

J.K Rowlings' incredibly triumphant Harry Potter books have captured the imaginations of young readers around the world, and No. 6 in the series, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BOOLD PRINCE is the best story so far. Ever since the books began their hugely successful roller coaster ride into movie adaptation, it has become evident that this series of adventures is very unique, tapping into young kids' need for written fantasy while simultaneously providing a high-quality read for those who are older in tooth. Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters, are out in the open now, so much so that Rufus Scrimgeour, the new Minister of Magic, feels it necessary to inform the muggle Prime Minister. Snape is up to no good, Draco has been given an assignment by the Dark Lord, and a net of security has dropped on Hogwarts. Deaths, disappearances, and destruction increase as Harry's penultimate year at Hogwarts begins. A darker tone, twists and turns plus a surprising and poignant death sees the story move forward in terms of character development. However despite defining this as more of a mature reader book, there still remains a fantastic sense of excitement and adventure for the kids. A Harry Potter fan from the beginning, this is my favorite book, To say too much would spoil the surprises, but rest assured, Half-Blood Prince is an exciting adventure that thrills at the turn of every page. It goes without saying that this will make a great film in 2008.<br /><br />Daniel Ross	2005-07-26

His work is admired not only by enthusiasts but Steven Spielberg, George lucas, Frank Darabont, Mike Mignola and many other high-profile A- class vissionary film makers. This is an excellent book charting Struzan's amazing art from Star Wars to The Lost World. I already have original cinema posters like Back to the Future and Star Wars that look great, and its fantastic to have such rich and wonderful art collected in one book. As soon as I bought it, I knew I had somethign special. A must-have for any film buff. Buy it now, and you'll love it, this is movie art at its finest.	2005-06-24

With some great insight into the characters in the world of comics and good layout, this guide tells you all you need to know about Peter Parker, Mary Jane and assotment of villians (Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom et all). DeFalco's extensive research has paid off, making this an essential addition to the already bookshelf-breaking collection of comic book guides.

The final in the \\"Art Of\\" series, Gary Russel does a good job of tying up the loose ends, mainly concerning the conceptual design and final presentation. Daniel Falconer's concept art is of particular interest here, and Randy Cook as well, showcasing their excellent and experimental work well here. I really enjoy taking a few hours off, sitting down and reading a really good movie book cover to cover on a warm summer day and this one fits the bill admirably. With character and costume sections covered well, this book has become one of the best. A good price tag means you're not looking too hard for any flaws (And there are none) aswell. Informative and always fascinating, this is perfect coffee table reading. A Must-have for LOTR fans who want every single piece of movie making history.	2005-06-17

But thankfully like the Spider-Man Essentials this is an extremely satisfying comic collection that chronicles the history of Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, Nightcrawler and the rest of the mutants. Both revealing just what a groundbreaking concept the comic was and showcasing some fantastic artwork, Stan Lee's X-Men comics are just fantastic, I love all these comics, perhaps too much, my bookshelves agree. But this is definitive, must-buy material. Exciting stories, gripping bad guys and some amazing twists, this is a masterpiece that deserves all the plaudits it gets. With a starting point like this, it's clear to see why the comic has endured some shaky times and an uncertain future. Kudos Stan Lee, kudos.	2005-06-17

While Jude Fisher's writing is even and sometimes evocative, this compilation of all three visual companions feels a bit superfluous. I mean, Lord of the Rings is great, and I'm happy to see that it hasn't been merchandised to death like the Star Wars prequels. But this isn't one of my favorite LOTR books for three reasons:<br /><br />1. Not enough images from Return of the King and too Fellowship heavy 2. An unsubstantial feel to the Isengard and Gondor chapters 3.Certain characters don't get wrapped up (Saruman and Denethor) But it's still a good read and a nice addition to anyone's LORD OF THE RINGS collection. Personally though, I prefer the 'ART OF' books.	2005-06-17

Killing off Robin (Due to a reader's poll so the readers killed him, not the writers) was both risky and created a fascinating edge to Batman. The Joker, in usual maniacal form here, weaves his sinister plots as Jason tries to find his long-lost mother. With real emotion, sharp action and an incredible finale, this is possibly the best in the Batman comic series. The artwork is deep, dark and complementive. Really impressive and inviting, and the theme contains a real sense of yearning for acceptance and a need for self-completion. A must have addition to any Batman fan's collection.	2005-06-17

And it doesn't skimp on the color pics either. Ridley Scott' epic GLADIATOR is given the full epic treatment here, with accolades aplenty and no shortage of impressive obstacles faced while making the film. I love all of Scott's films, from The Duelists to the recently released Kingdom of Heaven. But sometimes the accompanying books don't quite match the majestic tone of the films themselves. This is different. Walter Parkes' treatment is fair and doesn't fail to connect with the reader. Showcasing all the necessary film techniques and humorous asides along with abandoned concepts, this also contains cast and crew thoughts and praises Scott for his remarkable visionary touch. A solid read and well worth the price. Buy it now!	2005-06-17

While John Baxter's informative and interesting biography of Steven Spielberg is a solid examine, it fails to dig deep into its own questions and ethos. The early years at Universal Studios are well told and compelling, the author seems to lose interest halfway through concerning Temple of Doom and The Color Purple. Some chapters are prearranged too much breathing space, while other essential proceedings are frustratingly twee. To his credit, Baxter does a good job at showcasing some of the most excellent films (JAWS, RAIDERS and SCHINDLER'S LIST) but ultimately it lacks the depth that made Ian Freer's Spielberg book the best. This is one for the completists though, but for someone more perceptive, there are plenty of superior books.	2005-06-17

But I'm a hardcore Spielberg fan and have almost all the books written about him. Regardless, this is simply to fill a niggling itch, not necessarily for a good read. If you're looking for quality and sincere Spielberg books, Neil Sinyard and Ian Freer's excellent bios are great reading.	2005-06-17

I don't have to tell anyone how great Stan Lee was, but Daredevil was something of a Spider-Man clone when he first started out, and was chased by some very forgettable villains. But all that changed when the comic was given a new breath of life and now its one of my favorites. I've been collecting MARVEL comics for ages now, and this is one of my favorites. Great stuff, and a must-have for any comic collector. The artwork is visually stunning; the writing is sharp and contains real depth and emotion without sacrificing the quintessential villains and numerous amazing villains. Top-notch stuff.	2005-06-17
US	40977549	R2T6FRDHGOM7QX	0714838470	900467867	The Movie Book	Books	3	0	2	N	N	Silly and Superfluous	A note to prospective buyers: THE MOVIE BOOK will give you a hernia if you're not careful. But its rather bookshelf-busting size is a complement, with in-depth insights into the actors, directors, special effects guys, cinematographers and musicians who make movie magic. The only problem with this book is that several of the bios are out of date. Of course, you have to accept that with any movie chronicle book, but its glaringly obvious with certain actors. The Christopher Lee bio for example, states that the famed actor has never been able to escape the confines of horror movies, when of course, since the book was published, he has gone on to tackle serious drama (Jinnah), science fiction (Star Wars) Lord of the Rings and Willy Wonka. Now if that's not range, I don't know what is. My point is, when the actors and directors are being chronicled, rather than being presumptuous, instead be more ambiguous so the writing doesn't outdate so quickly. And there are some glaring omissions here (Where is Stan Winston?) One may suggest that for a book that not only displays its significance but also shoves it down your throat, that it might be time for a comprehensive update before this one gets put in the 'old time' bookshelf.	2005-06-17

Without the material entering the annoying world of overkill, this pleasing and informative book breezes along with its fascinating insights into how Spider-Man went from comic to silver screen. With enough inside info and graphic content to satisfy the most info-hungry geek, this is extremely satisfying and also is possibly one of the best film books ever written. It's that simple. Vaz has so many impressive book-writing credits under his belt already, but this is surely his best work. Containing info on the cast and crew, this never fails to interest and Vaz thankfully differs from other authors with a pre-determined un-pretentious standpoint. The early chapters focus on abandoned ideas about a team up of the Green Goblin and Doc Ock, and numerous costume changes for the first movie, where every little detail is spread out in a well-plotted format. Candid interviews with comic and film boys wraps up a nice package that keeps a very special place on my bookshelf. Highly Recommended.	2005-06-17

That's not to say that the comic is without merit, but the cons outweigh the pros. The story is well composed, and the action is faced paced and fun, but eventually the whole thing runs out of steam and starts repeating itself. Roger Robinson tries hard to encapsulate the reader by reassuring them that the end will be spectacular, but it dosn't quite match the high expectations I had for this, in what was supposed to be more energetic. A good read, but perhaps it could have done with a stronger story before being rushed into production. A must for hardcore AVP fans only.	2005-06-17

Charting his illustrious career from his early work in TV, to films Like Duel, Jaws, Raiders, E.T, Jurassic Park and The Lost World, this is an eminently satisfying addition to my impressive Spielberg collection. If it has a flaw, there is too much focused on his output in the early 90s and not quite enough concerning his famously fantastic films in the 70s and 80s. Regardless, a cool book and a great weekend read. Highly recommended.	2005-06-17

Why? the closer you stick to the source material, the better the film will be. Hellboy is such a great story, praised by fans and critics alike, so of course the success of the film shows just how well the comic is written.

The novelisation of Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is one of the best Star Wars novels, with creative storytelling and vivid imaginative techniques from author R. A. Salvatore. Staying closer to the film's structure than The Phantom Menace, ATOC is a fun, entertaining read with all the translations from film to book all perfectly created to produce one amazing tome that will not fail to enthrall. If it has a flaw, it sometimes stays too close to the film's black and white appearances, and dosn't quite tell enough of some of the minor backstory to fully encapsulate the reader. But it is well-written, and Salvatore weaves the storytelling to extraordinary areas creating a vivid world of good vs. evil. One of the best, if not THE best Star Wars books.	2002-06-16

The most interesting and obscure details concerning production are all here, with every base covered; the music, Bond's gadgets, the locales, the villians and the women! With comprehensive notes on production and spot-on reviews for all the films from DR NO (1962) to Tommorow Never Dies (1997), this is a must have for any Bond enthusiast. If it has a flaw, the lack of depth surrounding the films' origins is somewhat frustrating, but there is a wealth of fascinating facts, humourous anecdotes, fun trivia and plenty of color photos. Q would be happy.	2002-06-09

Originally written and released in 1976, this is one of those film books that instead of simply stating facts, also contains a wealth of info that makes it an enjoyable read. There are some audacious anecdotes about the clashes between the director, the stars and &quot;Bruce&quot;, the shark that never worked. With candid opinions and numerous interesting details about the production, this book is a must-have for fans of Spielberg.	2002-06-01

You can always tell if a novel is good if you can envision the locales, the charcters and the action. Continuing the story from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back is a darker, yet much more exciting translation of the film by Donald F. Glut. From the Ice Planet Hoth, to Luke's training and his confrontation with Darth Vader, this inventive tome is taken further from the overly-descripitive New Hope, and while the book is basically a word-for-word copy of the film it's such an enjoyable adventure that it hardly matters. Is it better than the film itself? Well, no, but to be transfixed by the first couple of pages is a very good sign. Escapism at it's finest.	2002-05-31

US	40977549	R3RDQC5AQDY6RG	0812505042	691093854	The Time Machine	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The Time Machine	Recently brought to cinemas again by Well's great-grandson Simon Wells, it's pretty obvious why this landmark science fiction tome has been visioned by Hollywood so much. Wells' story starts off with a man known only as the Time Traveller, who tells a group of friends his extraordinary tale of how he went into the distant future with his time machine. Wells weaves his masterful storytelling traditions brilliantly. You can always tell if a book is superior if you can envision the settings, the landscapes, and, to the Hollywood filmmakers, the camera shots. The story consists of the Time Traveller journeying to a distant earth where beings of the surface are haunted by the creatures of the underground world. H.G Wells created a story that has amazed and fascinated readers for years. And like his other incredible book, War of the Worlds (Also a popular Hollywood dipping well), the Time Machine is a shocking vision of what we are as people and what we, as humans will become.  This amazing story holds a deserved place in the library of all-time greats. H.G Wells' talent for storytelling is unsurpassed.	2002-04-26
