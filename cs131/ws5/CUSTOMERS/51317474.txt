Oddly enough, the subject of the dispute over the relief of Army General Smith on Saipan by Marine General Smith is discussed of all places in David Hackett Fischer's excellent book on American cultural patterns, Albion's Seed, which I recently read.  My interest was heightened when I checked the short treatment of the episode in Forrest Pogue's authoritative biography of General Marshall.  As a result, I obtained Gailey's book in used form and I wasn't disappointed.   <br /> <br />More than the extensive treatment of the tactical issues involved in the relief, I was fascinated by the author's fine discussion of the interservice differences and problems of command and coordination.  In the Smith-Smith conflict, these were much exacerbated by the choleric temperment of Marine Gen. Smith as contrasted with the more phlegmatic disposition of his Army subordinate.  Gailey is quite clearly a partisan of Army General Ralph Smith, but always states his case fairly and with abundant evidence and documentation.  Importantly, Gailey never allows his arguments to degenerate into an attack on the Marine Corps, although he decidedly sees Gen. Holland Smith's overidentification with his own branch of service as a marked handicap in his ability to credibly handle large units from both services optimally.   <br /> <br />Two individuals who receive notable secondary praise are General Marshall and Admiral Nimitz, each of whom approached the dispute reasonably and temperately in an effort to contain its explosive adverse potential and prevent future recurrences to the detriment of the war effort.  This is contrasted with the author's view of Admirals King, Spruance and Kelly Turner (and perhaps General Richardson), each of whom is portrayed as engaging in partisan turf protection, although in Richardson's case, justifiably so.  Reading Howlin' Mad vs. the Army led me to appreciate how much better interservice relations have been managed since 1944 by MacArthur (in both the latter part of the Pacific War and Korea) and Gen. Schwartzkopf in the First Gulf War.  There is a fundamental difference of philosophy and many attitudes among the Army and Marine Corps, but cooperation is as possible as it is necessary.  Harry Gailey's book demonstrates what can happen when that necessity falls victim to other considerations, particularly service chauvinism.	2004-11-20

I was extremely impressed at the author's critical analysis of the major players.  In terms of detailed biographical sketches and rigorous organization, it lapses from time to time and often spends several pages in diversions about subordinates.  What was particularly strong about Commander in Chief, however, was the perspectival discussions on the talents and importance of individual flag officers.  I was particularly impressed with the discussion of Eisenhower which was the best I've seen.  Larrabee actually gives him more praise and regard than his own son did in the recent Ike: the Soldier.  For once, Eisenhower comes across as a powerful and commanding figure in his own right, rather than as a fortunate protege of General Marshall.  Indeed, Larrabee explains in a perfectly plausible fashion why Eisenhower was a better choice for overall European command in 1944 and beyond.  Although it does tend to wander at times, Commander in Chief is finely written and makes for enjoyable, informative reading.  I recommend it highly.	2004-09-25

Marshall	Books	4	12	14	N	Y	Just the Facts Please	This is a perfectly unobjectionable book outlining Gen. Marshall's life and military and political careers.  It did strike me as being rather cursory in a number of areas and does not go very far in terms of the motivations and character of its subject.  Undoubtedly this is in part because Marshall left very little in the way of written reminiscences of his own and kept a studied distance from those with whom he worked.  As such, it leaves a bit to be desired as an in-depth biography.  Nonetheless, it is well written, fair in its viewpoint and can be read within a couple of evenings.  It is certainly a fine introduction to Marshall, but a reader looking for a comprehensive treatment of his life might well select one of the longer alternatives.	2004-09-16

His WWI recollections do a fine job of bringing out the terrors and guilts of a war long forgotton and little remembered, except for the short period of the Twenties.  If there is any shortcoming in this fine work, it is that it draws far too much from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthologies.  My guess is that March, who was trained as a lawyer like Masters (a former partner of the unethical (...) Clarence Darrow) grasped onto Masters' then-current work .  It's not a heroic idea, but one that's occurred to me.  In any event, Company K is a work that ought to be read far more than it is a century later.  WWI [is] seldom remembered as the great trauma that it was in the US.  Here's a book that tells how bad it was, and more importantly, why.	2004-07-04

Almost all treat their subject as intelligent, but lazy, at best, feckless and disloyal at worst.  Belloc takes the unique view that Charles had a strong and well developed set of principles that were reasonably adapted to a free and just society, but which were irreconcilable with the nouveau riche elements of his economy.  This treatment was quite reasonable and fairly convincing, but most of all made good reading.  As with much of Belloc's work, there is a strong institutional Roman Catholic orientation.  Belloc does downplay the licentiousness of the Restoration Court in general and its monarch in particular, but those details can be readily found elsewhere.	2004-01-22

As some of the other reviewers have noted, there are sporadic factual mistakes, but the greater shortcoming, to my mind, is the lack of much to say.  The factual issues discussed are pretty much common knowledge to anyone having much familiarity at all with military history (or history in general) in the Twentieth Century.  Worse yet, the insights and commentary provided are little more than unimaginitive &quot;conventional wisdom.&quot;  I had some suspicions about this book being of a mass market paperback quality, but I picked it up because it was one of the first in .mp3 audio format.  This proved to be a mistake as my first concerns were conclusively proven correct.	2003-04-03

Although it lacks the final shocks of An Instance of the Fingerpost, Scipio does provide a measure of subtle surprise at the end in a way which crosses up the reader's expectations. In essence, this is a novel of dichotomies and choices: decline or renewal, ignorance or learning, altruism or selfishness, resistance or submission and most of all, morality or amorality. Each of the three major characters, a late Roman aristocrat and sometimes philosopher, a medieval church beauracrat and poet, and a twentieth century academic, faces all of these choices and each appears to mark out his course early on in the story. Nonetheless, the ending point is not what the reader anticipates over the first three quarters of the text.    One of the key focal points around which the choices revolve is the long, unfortunate history of antisemetism in Western Christianity in its late classical, medieval and modern manifestations. Again, the way in which each character confronts and responds to actual mistreatment of Jews highlights the moral ambiguities and choices that Scipio is about. The ultimate payoff in comparing the short and long term outcomes to Manlius, Olivier and Julien is a subtle but highly powerful moral lesson which is seldom, if ever done so well in contemporary fiction.     I suspect that this sounds a bit obscure to the reader, but I don't want to spoil the analytical exercise or the teaching of the novel. As with Fingerpost, this is an incremental exercise of many layers and the gradual movement through those layers reveals Pears' real genius. Reading Scipio reflectively is not only an instructive project, but, more importantly, it will be an enriching one as well.	2002-11-01

Queenan in an unmerciful critic who is usually right on point and doesn't ease up.  One of his best tools is the ability to juxtapose several categories of \\"bad\\" into unusual combinations and then compare the result favorably to one known quantity.  One line I recall above all was something to the effect of anticipating some upcoming event with as much enthusiasm as Queenan would have for seeing a performance of MacBeth with the lead role played by Don Knotts.  That one had me recommending the book to coworkers and loaning my copy out.  No borrower was any less enthusiastic about it than I was.<br />Queenan's focus of attack is popular culture and there probably hasn't been such a pointed critique in the area since Ortega y Gasset in Revolt of the Masses.  Queenan, of course, is not writing philosophy or historical critique but he does the same things with humor and sarcasm and maybe is more effective for it.  He has written a number of other worthy books on generally similar themes, but Red Lobster is considerably the best of the lot as it doesn't run out of steam at the end (which, if anything, is Queenan's shortcoming as an author).  He takes on the role of the little boy who shouts that the Emporer has no clothes, but does so with a detailed description of what is actually there, warts and all, with a cleverness of prose that just isn't seen often enough today in a world of political correctness.  The last equivalent but isolated example I can think of was Truman Capote's description of a popular Hollywood novelist's work as \\"not writing but just typing.\\"  For real distilled wit, this is one not to be missed.	2002-09-08

Unfortunately, the book is just slightly dry unless accompanied by a first rate recitation of the Signifying Monkey legend as it is retold in the milieu of the Twentieth Century African American &quot;Toast.&quot;  I am delighted to report that this can now be experienced by newcomers through the wonderful performance of Rudy Ray Moore, which is available on the CD Greatest Hits.  When Dr. Gates' reader is able to reread his Signifying Monkey in light of Mr. Ray Moore's, a whole new world of perception and enjoyment will follow.  The synergy of these two works is splendid and neither one is quite so valuable without the other.	2002-05-24

Unfortunately, it is at its weakest in discussing the family's 17th Century English kings, who provide far more interesting subjects. Nonetheless, MacLeoed approaches them in a rather cursory and one dimensional manner which leaves a motivated reader rather unsatisfied. His closest approach to approval of any of these is for Charles II, but even then he damns this most fascinating and underrated of monarchs (in view of the challenges he faced) with faint praise.<br />More troubling, MacLeod demonstrates an open and excessive anti-Catholic bias rarely exhibited over the last half century. In doing so, he devalues the more modern and tolerant approaches to religious policy desired by the later Stuart kings, but which were frustrated by parliament and revolution. At the same time, he is slavish in his devotion to such premodern bigots as Cromwell and William of Orange. Still, he is no Macauley in this enterprise and I would recommend, instead, the second volume of Simon Schama's splendid History of Britain to the reader seeking a casual treatment of this subject area. Schama goes into almost as much depth as MacLeod, but is a vastly better writer and is considerably fairer in his evaluations of both individuals and issues.	2002-04-28

His narratives are always excellent and often spellbinding, particularly in this reading by Timothy West.  I used a cross country vacation drive to listen to both volumes and the miles simply melted away.  The closest comparison I can make is to Winston Churchill's multivolume History of the English Speaking Peoples, which Schama recalls as an influence in his youth.  In fact, Schama is a much better writer than Churchill and his books outshine those which perhaps were his model.<br />Schama has an almost unique ability to humanize the main players in British history, for instance Charles I, Cromwell, James II, Walpole, and Chatham (Pitt the elder), while at the same time retaining a proper sense of objectivity.  Similarly, he addresses the great partisan controversies and social trends of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries in a concise, but never oversimplified manner.  He also often juxtaposes the traditional popular historical view with current (often politically correct) revisionism and provides his critique and synthesis of each, always very fairly and perceptively.  His approach in this is rather similar to the excellent Citizens on the French Revolution, almost 15 years ago.  <br />I simply cannot find enough good things to say about this book in particular and the series in general.  Schama's work is always informative and entertaining, but it does more than that.  It also engenders a positive fascination with the subject matter.  As such, it makes the perfect gift for an average collegian or a particularly bright high school student.	2002-04-18

War With Mexico, 18461848	Books	5	4	6	N	N	One of Today's Best Writers of Military History	I had purchased this book quite some time before I actually began to read it.  The subject of the Mexican War was one of only moderate interest to me and I put off beginning it several times.  When I finally did begin, I couldn't put it down.  In large part, this was because of Gen. Eisenhower's (like many sons of great men, he seems reluctant to exploit his family connections) remarkable skills as a writer and narrator.  Indeed, I would rank him as perhaps the best writer of military history working today in light of his efforts in a number of different areas.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in this underdiscussed part of American history, but also to any aspiring writer, just to see how it ought to be done.  The excellence is not merely in style, but also in the fair and reasonable interpretation of both sides of a conflict that is normally viewed either through the lens of chauvinism or else with a masochistic level of anti-Americanism. If you are impressed with this splendid work, as I was, the next logical step is to buy a copy of Eisenhower's related work, Agent of Destiny on Winfield Scott.	2002-04-01

Balkan Ghosts and The Coming Anarchy more than demonstrate his ability to see behind the scenes and point out the deeper threads that television and radio news (and news magazines) overlook.  In fact, it might be fair to describe him as an All Things Considered or 60 Minutes for serious grownups.  I have never finished one of his books without being a much better informed, and generally just better, reader for my trouble.<br />In Empire Wilderness, Kaplan does all of this for the United States, although in the quieter portions of the nation from the Mississippi to the Pacific, with emphasis on the deep Great Plains and Arizona.  In doing so, as ususal, the author picks up on some social and demographic trends that are significant and profound in how they will change the &quot;white bread&quot; America of the 20th Century into something a good deal different.  Kaplan's work seldom cheers the reader up with prospects for the future, although it is always impeccably well written. On the other hand, it absolutely never fails to educate, usually on an underappreciated subject.  This time, the subject isn't just close to home, it is home.	2001-10-16

I read Caravans more than 20 years ago and was struck at that time by the extreme contrasts of a semi-barbaric society seeking to take baby steps toward joining the civilized world.  Knowing Michener's scrupulous research practices, I have little doubt that he portrayed the Afghans accurately in their attempts to step up to a Twentieth, or perhaps only a Nineteenth century level of civilization.  Recent events demonstrate that they failed.  Although not correct on every point, Caravans is fairly good at demonstrating that backwardness of the Central Asian Mohamadden society and the immense hurdle that its world view presented to cultural advances.  Unfortunately, his optimism on the point has proven misplaced over the years, indeed for that very reason.  I am not aware of a better introductory work on this part of the world, except perhaps some of Robert Kaplan's excellent essay collections.	2001-09-27

One might liken him to a Bill Clinton without either the populism or the personal magnetism.  By and large, Talleyrand is treated with contempt by both his contemporaries (Napoleon described him as a silk stocking full of number two) and historians, with a few exceptions (Wellington considered him the most consistent, effective and far-sighted proponent of France's interests at the Congress of Vienna and afterwards).  Nonetheless he is a figure of the first importance in history and a participant or nearby witness to the key events for two generations of European history.  What Kemske's novel does best is to acquaint the reader with Talleyrand's background, his motivations and his justifications (not always persuasive ones).  To that extent, it is an exceptional piece of historical fiction and a bit of fun to read as well.	2001-08-31

These essays are largely either transcriptions or, perhaps, more detailed revisions of those talks by Father Lee, a classics professor at the University of Toronto specializing in Vergil. If you, as I did, found those talks wonderful, but didn't record them, this book (and his other work on Wagner) is a godsend. Lee's skill as an essayist, blending profound literary, psychological and artistic insights with some personal recollections, is absolutely of the first order.

At that time, I lived in a slum ridden eastern city and Banfield's observations about the philosophical shortcomings leading to poverty and urban blight, as well as the cynicism of many of the recipients and brokers of governmental largess, seemed sensible, if not obvious from my empirical observations. Unfortunately, Banfield's observations, and more importantly his prescriptions for ending the embryonic \\"victim\\" culture, received more results in the form of threats to the author than in sounder urban governance. At the same time, more of the middle classes and productive members of the working classes fled that city as well as others around the country and those cities continued to decline. And that is the key importance of reading Banfield in 2001. Time has proven him correct, every bit as much as it has demonstrated the carnival barker's fraud that encompassed every portion of the so-called \\"great society.\\" These debates exist today as well and the education debate is one of the best examples. Similarly, our national and local city politics are replete with countless snake oil salesmen promising a new Jerusalem if we can just redistribute more wealth from the productive to the grasping victims. This does work very well for the redistributors, but a review of Banfield's text 30 years later demonstrates beyond reasonable dispute that it does not for the cities or their slum dwellers. A generation was wasted ignoring these realities; hopefully another one won't have to be.	2001-06-15

Unfortunately, that was during a week of law school finals. Although I finished the thousand pages in a few days, my grades turned out to be a full level below all my other semesters. That's how spellbinding Noble House is. This book is certainly top rate in terms of plot, suspense and characters in its own right, but what bound me to it during all my spare time was the interrelationship with the characters from Clavell's previous Hong Kong novel, Tai Pan and, to a lesser extent, King Rat. The same was true later with Whirlwind and Gai Jin, neither of which gathered a speck of dust in the bookstore before I bought it. Even today, I mourn over the fact that Clavell didn't live long enough to write another 2 or 3 books in his series. I have never read any other author who leaves so many questions unanswered and so many critical issues unresolved, but does so in a way that feeds the curiosity so strongly rather than disappointing. It is a tribute to Clavell's monumental skill as a storyteller that this is a strength of his novels rather than a major irritant to his readers. Very few of those readers stopped at one Clavell novel and, as far as I know, almost everyone who has read one goes on to read all the rest. Unlike so many of today's authors, he writes about heroes who aren't made of cardboard and who hold genuine mystery no matter how closely they are observed.	2001-06-01

As Secretary of Defense, McNamara soiled virtually everything he touched, in and out of Vietnam.  Our military didn't recover from his mind numbing approaches until late in the Carter or early in the Reagan administrations.  In this faux profound confessional, McNamara now suggests that he was a victim after all and was, at most, mistaken.  Think for a moment if he isn't still mistaken today -- it's something that he is very good at and has never departed from for long.  I would suggest an alternative explanation:  instead of doing tricks for his old master, Lyndon Johnson, in bungling the Vietnam war, McNamara is now on his hind legs begging for treats in the form of acceptance from a new group of Marxist chic celebrities and editorialists during his Martha's Vineyard summers.  One needn't belong to Mensa to infer that McNamara's bad judgment and sycophancy of the 60's hasn't suddenly evaporated, but simply changed directions in a &quot;Road to Damascus&quot; conversion.  Seldom in American history has a single individual had such a pathologic influence on our nation.  Even one of the easy analogies, that to Benedict Arnold, is inapt, because Arnold was a brave, dedicated and successful general for some years before he went bad.  Anyone who believes that McNamara has suddenly found or is suddenly speaking some profound truth need only look at his track record.  If he fooled us once, shame on him;  if he fools the American public now, shame on us!	2001-05-29

Sumter.  Most Civil War students are also acquainted with the military sequence of events of the siege and surrender, followed by Lincoln's call for volunteers to invade the Confederacy and the resulting general hostilities.  As far as I know, however, very few lay students of the War have much appreciation for the wide variety of political views on relations between the states at the time, on the possible approaches to the slavery situation (including proposals to guarantee protection for the institution made by some surprising individuals), on the subtle constitutional and other legal aspects of secession, and the actual process by which South Carolina's secession spread to ten other states, some of which were quite reluctant to do so initially.  Prof. Klein sets all of this out in a very readable, fast moving text which is guaranteed to hold the reader's interest and attention.  From my standpoint, the most interesting aspects involved the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts by some of the most unlikely individuals to pull the situation back from the brink, and the cynicism of others who are often described in more altruistic and one dimensional terms.  At many junctures in Klein's book the reader will get the irresistable urge to play &quot;what if.&quot;  I &quot;read&quot; this book by a rented audio tape edition during some day long vacation drives and I was extremely pleased with it, in a way that is often not true with well researched histories.  The other reviewers who have described this as comparable to a mystery or other novel are not far off the mark and I recommend it very highly.	2001-05-21

The Walter Ker Loeb then in use was published after the turn of the century and is very bowdlerized, unlike the current Shackleton Bailey which uses current vulgar equivalents.  I had a most unexpected surprise when I was reading some of the earlier books in Colleen McCullough's Fall of the Roman Republic series.  Ms. McCullough is very conscientious and considerate of her readers in providing a glossary at the end of each book, but at one point, I found her mistranslating the noun irrumator (and the cognate verb irrumo), as involving the passive rather than active participant in certain misbehaviour.  Like the dedicated professional that she is, McCullough corrected the mistake with a courageous admission of fault in her next volume and I can only assume that it was brought to her attention by another owner of James Adams' fine work.  It is certainly handier (and far less expensive) than using an Oxford Latin Dictionary and offers a far more interesting exposition of the subject areas than any mere reference work.  I highly recommend it and commend the Johns Hopkins Press for publishing such an esoteric but worthy project.	2001-03-27

This is one, and Pierre Berton is almost the only author whose works made that list more than once.  The War of 1812 is a generally neglected subject in America, except perhaps for the New Orleans campaign of 1815.  Berton writes from a distinctly Canadian viewpoint, although he writes so wonderfully that even the most chauvinistic American will hardly notice and won't care.  Any time I begin to write something that I hope readers will enjoy beyond simple information, I try to look back over a little of Berton's work in vain hopes of picking up something of his incomparable style.	2001-03-21

Pierre Berton has written a great masterpiece of narrative history.  I first read this book almost 20 years ago, and I can still recall the enjoyment it gave.  This is perhaps the best book of history in terms of enjoyable reading which I have come across.  The only author in the same league today is Simon Schama, and he generally works in somewhat more esoteric, less popular areas.  I have also discussed the excellence of Berton's writing in a review of the companion volume Flames Across the Border:  1813-14 which, along with this text, makes up as fine a two volume set of North American history as can be obtained.	2001-03-21

His writing is fluid and readable and seldom commits the sins of prolixity or obscurity common in much academic history.  The tradeoff, unfortunately seems to be a significant lack of depth or interpretation.  The reader familiar with Wellington's career will find little new and is far better served with Lady Longford's two volume work which remains the authoritative piece on the subject.  Alternatively, Phillip Guedalla's 1931 biography is still available through out of print searches or otherwise and provides a compromise between length and detail.	2001-03-07
US	51317474	R1Z2PKOU9UMNG0	1585004286	569411157	The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Svejk During the World War, Book One	Books	5	36	36	N	N	A New Worthwhile Translation	This is the third translation of Svejk in English of which I'm aware. The first done in the 40's is highly bowdlerized and only of the first half. The second, by Sir Cecil Parrott in the early 1970's covered the whole work and was bolder. The present volume by Sadlon and Joyce seems to be the most accurate and literal translation (although admittedly I don't know a half dozen words of Czech) in view of the background and qualifications of those individuals. It does constitute only the first volume of four, although the later books are promised. I certainly found it worthwhile and fully intend to purchase the later volumes as they come out. One minor critique I have is that the prose reads somewhat more harshly and has an angrier and more proletarian diction to it. Knowing what I do of Jaroslav Hasek, I am sure that this is the result of painstaking efforts at accuracy by the translators. Unfortunately, this puts a rougher face on the text and, in my view, detracts from the uproarious humor that I found in the Parrott translation. I emphasize here that the Sadlon version is an absolute necessity and accept that the distinctions in the translations flow from greater care by him as opposed to the prior. On the other hand, Cecil Parrott's subtlety and innuendo often strike me as funnier than Jaroslav Hasek's brasher &quot;in your face&quot; writing style on its own. The comparison might be likened to one between Jerry Seinfeld and Sam Kinnison: each one is wonderful in his own right, but much different from the other.<br />Again this is intended more as an observation than a criticism, and I would urge any reader to buy both versions. Svejk is far too great a text to view through one lense only. In either version, it is laugh out loud funny in its descriptions of politics, bureaucracy, the military and the strong ethnic tensions among the Central Europeans of the first world war era. The best aspect of all is in Hasek's characters, and the book could be translated by Janet Reno and still be clever enough to keep you awake all night laughing.	2001-01-11

The Cecil Parrot edition is, needless to say, far preferable (it even contains a wonderful introduction including a discussion of Czech profanity as compared to that in English) and I've read it again and again since it came out in 1974. Shelby Foote said somewhere that every year he reads Proust as a sort of literary vacation. About ever 2 or 3 years I reread Svejk to cleanse my literary palate and it's always as fresh and as enjoyable as it was the first time. The dialogue, the characters and the situations in Svejk are, stated simply, the funniest I've ever read. Many other books have many merits in this regard, but none has approached Hasek in the sustained hilarity over 500 pages or more. The secret policeman, Bretschneider, Chaplain Katz, Sergeant Major Vanek, Cadet Biegler, Balloun and Lt. Dub are all memorable characters in their own right, but when they interact the result surpasses anything I have ever read for comedy. The episode involving a character with writer's block during his drafting of a prayer to be recited while administering Mr. Kokoska's pharmaceutical powders for cow flatulence is a classic rivalling Aristophanes or Rabelais. [I realize that sentence is confusingly prolix, so please read the book; it will be worth your while.] The term \\"laugh out loud\\" is overused and abused these days, but The Good Soldier Svejk will have you disturbing family and friends with repeated guffawing any time you are reading it nearby. I can't give a text any higher recommendation.	2001-01-11

Books	5	56	58	N	Y	Eminently Readable Work by a Serious Scholar	The overlap between excellent scholarship and exceptional readability in today's history writing is exceedingly slim.  Schama's History of Britain is as good an example as the market holds today.  While it obviously doesn't treat the subject area in the same depth as his his texts on Dutch and French subjects or on Art history, the area covered here is immense.  From my standpoint, Prof. Schama performs a herculean task simply to distill the material into such a usable and enjoyable work.  I am quite hard pressed to think of a another such work of excellent writing on a large subject area other than Shelby Foote's Civil War volumes, which seem somewhat comparable in every positive respect.  Additionally, one can open A History of Britain and read with enjoyment at almost any point and for any period of time.  The characterization of key players matches that of the best novels and Schama's writing compares favorably to a somewhat similar work, Winston Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples.  I recommend disregarding the less favorable reviews following as unfair in perspective.  The combination of a powerful scholar of Simon Schama's caliber with such graceful writing is almost unheard of and the alternative of tedious fact recitation is no choice at all. This is a book to purchase twice, once for yourself and again as a gift for a good friend.	2001-01-09

About every 3 or 4 years though, I find an exception and this (like Umberto Eco's best work) was one of the strongest.  At the end of this very cleverly drawn book, I was longing for more, including more information beyond the dramatis personae entries on the main and secondary characters.  Before reading Pears, I had some general familiarity with the unfortunate period of the Commonwealth and the fresh air of the Restoration, but his work put some very real flesh and blood to both periods.  As such, I've been reading little else since I finished Fingerpost.  For me, this ability to awaken, or even create, a new subject of intellectual curiosity is one of the rarest, and therefore most valuable, talents an author can hone.  Pears does this masterfully through his movement from one narrator to the next, each of whom reveals truths about his predecessors which they concealed or ignored.  I would recommend this to any thinking reader, perhaps with the caveat that some patience may be needed initially, as Pears doesn't insult the reader's intelligence by uncovering the plot catch (or catches) right away.  I guarantee that such patience will be rewarded many times over.	2000-12-26

Sedaris' reading is a little saccharine at times, which is a little surprising for someone who writes with such supernatural dry ironic wit.  Apparently, perfection on both counts is too much to ask.  On the other hand, the level of dry, ironic wit in his writing is so far above the mean that it would be unjust to expect more from a reader.  Actually, describing Sedaris' wit as dry is pretty much akin to comparing sulfuric acid to Bourdeaux wine.  Ann Magnuson gives a reading performance every bit as good as the author's black humor writing. [Amy Sedaris' work is also wonderful, but any Strangers With Candy fan will expect that as a matter of course.] With the holiday season all but upon us, Holidays on Ice is a perfect antidote for the obligatory flood of Christmas culture.  I simply can't recommend these tapes too strongly and I imagine that the written text is every bit as good. Just exercise extreme care if you drive while they are playing.	2000-11-03

I notice that of the 5 reviews below, 4 are  unfavorable in varying degrees.  They are all accurate in direct proportion  to their level of criticism.  This text is little more than a polemic.<br />I  recently went back over Alan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind (after  reading Saul Bellow's wonderful Ravelstein), which was my chief source of  Straussian thought other than college texts read over a generation ago.   Bloom repeatedly castigated (North) American academics for their  doctrinaire orthodoxy and lack of genuine philosophic vision.  Ms. Drury's  text demonstrates his point much more effectively, although presumably  unintentionally.  Unlike Strauss, Bloom and others in their school, she is  never able to justify or explain her value programming and simply proceeds  from the (incorrect) assumption that the reader shares her basic premises  which differ from those of the Straussians. Further, the book has a  repetitive, sing song prose style that bespeaks a lack of editing.  The  same sentence form, and in some cases even the same sentence, appears so  often as to be remarkable even to the casual reader.  This makes for  tedious reading.<br />One thing the Ms. Drury does do, almost to perfection,  is to set up a &quot;straw man&quot; argument using an oversimplified or  disorted paraphrase of a Straussian or Bloomian thought and then  demolishing it in a way that would be impossible if the point were viewed  in full context.  If that is what you are after, this is a valued resource.   Otherwise, don't repeat my mistake.	2000-08-09

Now, almost 20 years later, through good (then) and bad (now) administrations, Kahn's predictions proved astonishingly accurate.   They contrast markedly and tellingly with the gloom and doom pronounced by  a lot of people who are still around and still misstating the present and  future (did you hear that Al?). Herman Kahn is said to have achieved the  highest score ever on military standardized tests during his youth in the  1940's and he was undoubtedly one of the few American geniuses of my  lifetime.  The Hudson Institute lives on as his legacy, but it has never  quite lived up to his own level of excellence.   The great reason to look  for a copy of this book long out of print is to consider the premises and  rationale and compare them to the prognostications from the greens and  others on the left.  No one can tell the future and probably few if any  even approach the intellectual prowress of a Herman Kahn, but a review of  the methodology of genius (and that of the chicken littles) ought to go a  long way in defining where to place our trust and where to assign our  skepticism.	2000-07-19

Conservatives often support restrictions on behavior in order to effect  security, while liberals preach freedom but are happy to truncate it in  order to marshall the resources to support their favored victim classes.   Either side, if honestly introspective, ought to be troubled about why this  is.  Thomas Sowell, one of America's most thoughtful and intellectually  honest commentators explains just why this is and traces the origin of the  question to the Enlightenment and post-enlightenment thinkers before and  shortly after the French Revolution. He describes the key dichotomy as  between the &quot;constrained&quot; and &quot;unconstrained&quot; views of  human nature, which view mankind as flawed or perfectable, respectively.   Another author describing comparable distinctions in international  relations, Robert Kaplan, uses the terms Realist and Idealist to discuss  the same cleavage.  In setting this out, Sowell manages to produce a  genuinely Aristotelian approach to modern thought that is extremely worth  reading.  What's more, he does all of this in a very readable, approachable  prose that it more enjoyable to read than any text on such deep subjects  ought to be.  It's one of the very few books that improves the reader while  giving pleasure in doing so.	2000-07-15

It's also a much different work than anything he's done before.  The most interesting aspect of  Portrait is its introduction into the mind of the author looking for a  subject for his next novel.  Heller produces some vignette items that are  very clever in themselves, but which lack the potential for development  into a larger work -- thus presenting his dilemma with something like, but  not exactly, writer's block.  By doing this with plots from American  literature and literary biography, Biblical figures and Homeric characters  and other Greek mythology, he gives a pleasant, if not profound, work that  is excellent for summer beach reading.  On a deeper level, Heller seems (at  least) to share some of the reflections of his last couple of years in an  autobiographical sense. Portrait is well worth a trial, if only as light to  moderate entertainment.	2000-07-06

Of course, his writing (and that of Mrs. Friedman) is uniquely  practical, understandable to the lay reader and, most importantly,  non-emotional. Similarly the empirical examples for his ideas are  self-evidently logical, for example the comparison between Meiji Japan and  post-Independence India, but that doesn't explain the man's attraction. The  value of his insights and the fallacies in many opposing viewpoints may  only become clear with passage of a good deal of time, but when they do,  the truth and falseness is incontrovertable.<br />I have at long last come to  the conclusion that Milton Friedman is a kind of non-religious saint who  brings a higher level truth to the comprehension of others having only  fractional shares of his IQ;  he is a sort of economic Acquinas.  More  importantly, Prof. Friedman manages to cut through so many of the myths of  conventional wisdom and explain the true reasons for failures in our  society and economy in ways that are heretical to so many of the  established interest groups in America (or the UK) such as the public  education industry.  If the truth be known, much of the current economic  bliss we now enjoy results from the espousal of his ideas 15 to 20 years  ago here and in Britain and the slow retreat from those principles by  government in both countries will gradually revive the messes of the '60's  and '70's.  This book, and Capitalism and Freedom, ought to be familiar to  every thinking person as an innoculation against the opinions held out as  truth in the popular media and the mental mildewing that grows around them.	2000-06-19

Mr. Stein's pursuits and accomplishments are too numerous and  varied to repeat here, but he surpasses all of them in his level of (I say  it again) decency.  More importantly, his stories and reflections about  Tommy and other friends serve as a genuine model for others to live up to  and Stein never in the least part succumbs to a temptation to preach or  talk down.

The reviews of its ostensible sequel Closing Time (many of them unfairly negative) prove this.  Several of his works in the 70's and early 80's tried to live up and,  although decent novels, fell well short of the mark.  Ultimately in 1988 he  struck gold (no pun intended) again.  Picture this is a tour de force of  all of Heller's best dialogue writing, irony and subtle political  commentary and does all of the things right that Catch 22 did, although at  a somewhat lesser volume.  It has always been a mystery to me why the book  wasn't better received critically and financially, apart from the possible  fact that it came close on the heels of Heller's frightening episode of  Guillan Barre syndrome and his nonfiction work on that experience.  Anyone  who has enjoyed his best work and been slightly disapponted by his  also-rans ought to pick this one up for a light but thoughtful and entirely  pleasant read.	2000-06-01

Empire Wilderness was the best treatment of its type in more than 15 years, since Joel Garreau's 9  Nations of North America.  The Coming Anarchy is more topically organized  and less location specific, but is even better as a clear eyed -- clear  headed anticipation of the future.  That anticipation is far from  optimistic, but this doesn't in any way detract from its worth.  Kaplan has  a wonderful sense of appreciating what Thomas Sowell describes as the  &quot;constrained&quot; view of human nature and potential and he can see  the shortcomings of civilization moving more to the forefront in the   world.  It's not necessarily cheering to hear these things, but it is  immensely refreshing to hear a commentator who isn't weighed down by the  foolish optimism and unthinking orthodoxies rampant today.  An evening with  this book can cure a month's worth of mind-numbing observations by CNN  newscasters and the like. For anyone who has the intellectual curiosity and  common sense to ask &quot;why?&quot;  Kaplan is a kindred spirit, because  he understands Aristotle's principle that the argument relying on authority  (or worse yet common belief) is the weakest of all.	2000-05-19

Behind the engaging writing however, there is a much greater virtue in the  demythologizing of several of the cardboard champions of American history,  particularly Clarence Darrow and the organized labor movement.  Lukas  demonstrates beyond reasonable hope of rebuttal that union leaders such as  Big Bill Haywood were all too ready to further their ambitions by murder,  perjury and unlawful coercion, and that Darrow was all too willing to serve  as a cheerful accessory after the fact by using his tremendous skills of  demagogic oratory to misrepresent the true facts and mislead and confuse  the fact finders on juries.  The crucial message of Big Trouble is that the  Haywoods, Darrows and their fellow travelers ought never be lionized, as  they usually are, and that their ideological heirs today ought to be viewed  with profound suspicion and distrust when they argue otherwise.  One of  Lukas's multitude of trivia items in his narrative almanac of the  Steunenberg murder and subsequent miscarriage of justice (procured in large  part by Darrow's witness tampering) is that the presumptive leader of the  conspiracy, Haywood, wound up his years in Leninist Russia in the warm red  glow which began that country's retreat from modern civilized political and  economic practice.  Had the Haywoods and Darrows of the early part of this  centure been more successful in their hopes and plans here, we might well  have wound up in the same sad shape.	1999-12-27

He is certainly the first person to be conversant with so large a portion of the culture of his times since  Aristotle, or perhaps Aquinas, and his writing is far more clever and  enjoyable to read that that of either of those philosophers.  Posner is  probably the first writer to articulate what is likely to be the unbiased  verdict of history on Clinton after the current axes are long ground.  The  book's grandest accomplishment is not only to show that the emperor has no  clothes (a peculiarly apt metaphor), but to identify the hypocrisy and  hyperbole of numerous intellectuals and academics who ought never to be  taken seriously again, such as Abner Mikva, Alan Dershowitz, Ronald Dworkin  and other ventriloquist dummies for James Carville.
