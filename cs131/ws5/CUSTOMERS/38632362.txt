This book is your typical, boring, angsty romance with a little bit of magic thrown in to confuse you. The basic plot is: teenage girl meets man with a tortured soul. They wed and have great sex. Big misunderstanding drives them apart. Great sex brings them together. More big misunderstandings drive them apart again. Man acts like a real dick weed but the girl hangs on to him anyway (hey, the sex is great!). Duex ex machina and they live happily ever after. The end. <br /> <br />There was enough mystery (and sex) in the book to keep me reading but for anyone who was interested in the mystery the ending was a bitter disappointment. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br />For anyone interested in the mind reading aspect of this book, you are much better off reading The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris. She does a much, much, much better job of visualizing the life of someone with the \\"gift\\" of mind reading. <br />	2005-07-04

Robb's In Death series comes very close). Unfortunately, this book only gets half of the equation right - the romance was wonderful! I loved the main characters and the way their love slowly built over the course of the book. This made the whole book a very enjoyable read and I highly recommend it to lovers of romance. However, the science fiction aspect of the book was not well thought out. Ms. O'Shea had a very nice concept but the ideas were way underdeveloped. Also, too many things didn't make any sense. For example - Why didn't the killer (who had apparently been living on the planet for thousands of years) make some attempt to leave the planet? Why didn't the killer take over Ravyn and Damon mentally while they were still back at the CAT base? Why was the Spec Ops team training on that planet? What were the wars being fought over? If another war was on the horizon, why wasn't there more interest being shown in the Old City? Why did Damon feel ethically comfortable trying to find weapons to kill other humans in the next war? Why didn't Ravyn and Damon tell Alex and the rescue team exactly what had transpired and demonstrate their ability to manipulate the planet's power. Why did Damon try to confront the killer on his own when he had been clearly shown that without Ravyn he could be easily taken over?  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong - I really, really enjoyed this book as a romance novel but I couldn't help thinking how much better this book could have been if Ms. O'Shea had worked a little harder answering at least some of the above questions. Oh well, the search for a great science fiction/romance goes on. <br />	2004-08-01

Helen Bianchin knows how to do sensual sex scenes and for that I give this book two stars. However, this is also suppose to be a romance and I really didn't detect any true love between Katrina and Nicos. All I saw was two people who were well matched in every way but only seemed to feel intense sexual desire for each other. Where was the love? Where was the trust and committment? After one very intense sexual experience, Katrina &quot;realizes&quot; that it couldn't be that intense if it wasn't love. Sorry Katrina but very good (even outstanding) chemistry does not equal love.	2004-07-24

Here Ms. Asaro uses the old tried and true cheat of having two people &quot;destined&quot; for each other and bound together through some sort of mystic or psychic melding of minds. It's especially galling here since Soz and Jailbait- whoops! I mean Jaibriol have almost NOTHING in common. <br />OK, so the romance is bad, what about the science fiction? Well first of all there is Ms. Asaro's future history. I have to give her credit for trying but it just doesn't hold together for me. Aliens pluck prehistoric humans from Earth to seed another planet? Why? When did psi abilities first show up and why do the Allied worlds deny that the abilities exist? If the sadistic Aristos only genetically enhanced ability is a high tolerance for pain how did they come into power and stay in power for so long? And here is the biggest thing that made no sense: If the entire safety of the Tholian Web - whoops! I mean Skolian Web and therefore Skolian Empire rests on a handful people (the Rhons) why in the HEdoublehockeysticks are they allowing these people to get into dangerous situations?! All of them should be the most protected people in the galaxy. That Soz would be allowed to go into battle is ridiculous.Maybe I'm missing some important point because the whole explanation of the Rhon and the Skolian web was very confusing.<br />Even though the future history was a bit shakey I enjoyed the heck out of the first 1/3 of the book. It was very well written with some excellent action sequences. I love the way it was from a Skolian point of view with people from Earth being the Aliens. This also made for some good humor. My only big problem with the plot here is that Soz lets Jaibriol go. HUH? She knows what will happen to him and she knows what kind of threat he could be but she gives him no help and makes no plans to provide him with any help. That's just plain ludicrous.And why were the Traders allowing Jaibriol to stroll around an Allied Planet anyway?<br />In the second part of the book, the plot grinds to a complete halt while Soz takes a little vacation and undergoes pschoanalysis. I kid you not. Now having the main character undergo analysis in a scince fiction book is not a new idea (check out Fredrick Pohl's &quot;Gateway&quot;). However, unlike &quot;Gateway&quot; the analysis here is not well done and is just plain boring. This is the worst section of the book and almost pointless.<br />The third part of the book is quite readable but by the time I had gotten to it I had pretty much lost interest. It's too bad because after reading the first part of the book I really thought it had a lot of potential. Although this is certainly not the worst science fiction I've ever read it is no where near the best. I do not recommend buying this book.	2004-05-31

I guess Ms. Pierce didn't want to repeat herself but someone reading this book first may feel the background is too sketchy.<br />If you love fantasy and magic (like I do) you may be disappointed in \\"First Test\\". This book has almost no magic in it and reads almost like a historical of midevil times. Actually what I thought of when I read this book was what happened at The Citadel (military college) several years ago. When they first opened the school to women there was intense resistance. The poor girl (I have forgotten her name) who was the first female \\"accepted\\" was put through absolute hell and was not able to stick it out more than a week. But she paved the way and the next girl was successful. Now a woman  going to the Citadel is not even a blip on the media's radar screen.<BR>So it is interesting in \\"First Test\\" to see how Keladry makes it through her first year of training to be a knight. The book has relevance to our times too. Even though it is similar to what Alanna goes through, there are some key differences. In fact, the diffences actually bugged me a bit. Why didn't Kel ever seem to go into town? Did Alanna have an older page sponsor? Anyway, I didn't think that was that big a deal. What bothered me much more was how bland this book and Keladry are. Not much seems to happen here so if you're looking for adventure, forget it. And Keladry is about the most boring, stoic heroine you can imagine. Actually, her personality is perfect for the first female knight-in-training but that doesn't make for a very interesting person (or book). Still, I love the way Keladry is changing minds not by talking but by doing.With her amazing courage and fortitude she is a wonderful role model for young women. Actually, a much better role model than Alanna.	2004-05-31

However, I'm really not sure how the main characters fell in love since they barely spoke to each other throughout the entire book. I almost went back and counted the number of times they were in the same room (it couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 times) but I decided it wasn't worth it. Still I would recommend reading this book if you are a fan of Ms. Darcy because I find her style of writing very enjoyable.	2004-05-22

I have to agree with another reader here - you cannot find a more tiresome couple than Cressida and Rossiter. Actually, I use the term &quot;couple&quot; loosely since you really rarely see them together and when you do, they are fighting. If this were a contemporary romance I would give the marriage a year, but since this is a Regency Romance, I forsee years of a hellish marriage ahead of them.<br />I have read many Clare Darcy novels that I love but unfortunately, this is not one of them. Probably the book's worst fault is that Cressida is one of the most unlikable heroines I have ever read about. She is stupid, snobbish, pretentious, and shallow. I do not recommend this book.	2004-05-21
US	38632362	R2EXPGX9JJDTAU	0451096118	372150026	Allegra	Books	2	5	8	N	N	Disappointed	I've read several of Ms Darcy's books and this is the first one I haven't liked. First off, the book is boring - there is not enough of the clever conversation that I know Ms Darcy is capable of. And the Heroine (Allegra) is not just dull, she is rather stupid and WAY too full of pride. I did like her sister though and wish the book had been about Hilary instead! Sir Derek was so arrogant that I was rooting for Allegra to fall in love with someone else. But what I disliked most about this book was that Allegra and Sir Derek spent almost the entire book misunderstanding and fighting with each other. I enjoy it when the main characters banter with each other but I hate it when the banter crosses the line into sniping as it does in this book. Not reccommended.	2004-05-20
US	38632362	R210A2LQ3TCMBP	0380812525	135421562	Ritual of Proof	Books	2	2	7	N	N	Great Satire!	As a romantic science fiction novel, this book is terrible. Why would any intellegent beings want to base their society on Regency England?! Regency England was a time and place of dangerous social unrest. The 10,000 or so &quot;Haves&quot; did alright while the millions of &quot;Have Nots&quot; were barely surviving. The rest of the so called science was laughable and the romance was tepid at best.<br />However, as a satire of Regency Romance novels, &quot;Ritual of Proof&quot; excells. By taking the plot of a typical, rather boring Regency Romance and switching the genders Ms. Joy has done a fantastic job of showing how absurd these romances are. Looking at the book as a satire, I had two (major) problems with it. 1) The book should have been a short story. After the first 100 pages or so, the book got very, very boring. It was like one of those Saturday Night Live skits that go on and on and on - it was a great idea but once the idea is presented it should end quickly. 2)Ms Joy is making fun of Regency Romances and their readers, but the problem is that the only people who will understand the satire are the ones she is making fun of (people like myself who enjoy reading Regencys). It seems very mean spirited of Ms. Joy to make fun of the very people who support her. She's free to write what she wants but I will no longer buy it (and I recommend that you don't either.)	2004-05-12

Too many things didn't make sense to me. Why did Alanna's brother bring Roger back from the dead? I know he was arrogant but I find it hard to believe he was that stupid. And Alanna is hardly upset at all! And the old king forgives Roger everything?! After almost killing his beloved wife?! I found that whole plot line frustrating and unbelievable. I also couldn't understand how Alanna could just go riding off when George was having problems with the Claw. Why doesn't she stand by him when he's in such danger? And why doesn't george just &quot;take care of&quot; the Claw - he's a thief for goodness sake and I'm sure he's had to &quot;take care of&quot; many other thieves because of his position. And it doesn't make sense to me that George is more honorable than Alanna, Jon, and the Dragon put together but he is the king of thieves. What's up with that?! His mother is a very good person - how did George end up as a thief? I think the thing that bothered me most was that Alanna rides away from George and Jon and their very serious troubles and never gives it a second thought. What kind of friend/lover is she? She meets up with Liam, is attracted to him, and within a week they are sleeping together. I know she hasn't made any committment to George but it still seems pretty sleazy to me. I would have been much more comfortable with this if George and Alanna had talked about how Alanna wasn't ready for a committment and they should see other people for a while and blah, blah, blah. But George and Alanna left everything very open ended and it seemed to me that Alanna betrayed George with Liam. It bothered me the none of this was ever acknowledged in the book and Alanna NEVER thought anything about how George might feel. Unfortunately, I really lost a lot of respect for Alanna and some for George for putting up with it. Finally, I always loved Faithful and yet weNEVER learn anything about who he really is. Maybe we will learn in another series but I really felt Ms. Pierce should have given the explanation in this book. All in all I was frustrated.	2004-05-10

I didn't find it boring although it does seem as if Ms. Pierce wrote book 3 & 4 of this series as one book which was later broken into two books due to length. As such this book reads like a set up to book four. No major action takes place and there is no real climax to the book. However, Alanna makes two major life changing decisions. 1) She decides to start developing and using her magic. I liked that she became shaman although it seemed ridiculous that the Voice and the headman would have allowed such a weak and stupid shaman to stick around for so long! 2) Alanna decides that she cannot marry Jon. This is a very difficult decision for Alanna to make and I think (given their very young ages) that both Jon and Alanna react in a very realistic manner. Alanna bases her decision on logic and while Jon is not yet ready to accept it, I think Alanna has made a very wise and mature choice. What I didn't like was that she immediately begins to act immature again by using George to make herself feel better. The way George is written he's alittle too perfect. He's always there for Alanna and he is always supportive. You never see him have a relationship with any other women so I really felt sorry for him here. I wish that he and Alanna could have kept their relationshiip platonic until Alanna was ready to make a commitment to him. The way it happens makes them both look rather weak and immature. But, George has always been my favorite so a part of me was happy to see them get together. Anyway, if you are looking for a very romantic relationship in this book, you won't find it and I know many people were disappointed in that.	2004-05-10

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed. The biggest problem I had was that the two main characters seemed totally incapable of being honest with each other. Why didn't Slater ask Erin out on a date in the first place? Why would he treat her as a employee for a year and then propose to her out of the blue? It was bizarre. Also, why did Slater date the obviously horrible Cecile for so long? It said in the book that she had lasted longer than most of his girlfriends. That made me dislike Slater from the start. On the plus side I really liked the way Slater stuck by Erin while she went through her ordeal. There were some interesting twists and turns in this book but I hated the way Erin and Slater always seemed to be at odds. After a while all the misunderstandings and sniping just got on my nerves. I feel like I can't recommend this book.	2004-05-03

This book is not perfect so maybe I shouldn't have given it 5 stars, but it is definitely better than 99% of the romances out there. Serenity and Caleb are wonderful together and although the dialogue was not as snappy as some of the JAKs I've read that is more than made up for by the characters' warmth and caring. Once Serenity and Caleb work out their initial problem their relationship never looks back. Conflict comes from outside and throughout the book they get through things by depending on each other. To me this is what love and romance are all about. As usual Ms. Krentz writes some great secondary characters and a fairly good mystery. I must agree with another reviewer though that Serenity's ex-boyfriend is a pure annoyance and not cute or charming at all. But I did find the prologue and epilogue funny. All in all, very highly recommended.	2004-05-01

Take the \\"hero\\" Dominic, he is identified right away as an explorer but we learn almost nothing else. What does he explore? Why? How did he become an explorer? Why is he having trouble financing his expedition? Who else will be going with him? What does he expect to learn? Why is he going to a PR firm to help get funding? Why is the top flight PR firm giving him a \\"freebie\\"? I know next to nothing about explorers but I'm pretty sure funding comes through applying for grants handed out by various institutions. Would hanging out with a supermodel help?<br />OK, what about the \\"heroine\\" Izzy. Why had she spent so much time traveling around in third world countries? What was she doing during that time? What was her job before assisting Pepper? Why didn't she get psychlogical help after the incident in South America? Why didn't she tell her family about it? I must say that the way this is written, Izzy and Jemima look like women with very deep psychological problems. The whole part where she doesn't eat andgoes off into la-la land was very weird. And Dominic comes off looking very bad. She faints dead away and he doesn't even get her medical attention. Instead he considers himself a \\"gentleman\\" because he doesn't take advantage of her highly impaired condition (that's called being a normal decent human being Dominic!). I found that whole scene very disturbing. This couple has nothing between them except for sex and a couple of shared secrets. I give their marriage six months tops.	2004-04-27

Katy starts to get bridal jitters right after the wedding but I never quite understood how she and Garrett came to be in that situation. It seemed there was almost no communication of a personal nature between them before the wedding. But that doesn't jibe with Katy's personality. The Katy we see in the book would have darn well gotten her declaration of love before she married Garrett. So it was hard for me to swallow that Katy would all the sudden freak out after the wedding night. It made Katy look like a total idiot. But once you get past that the book isn't too bad as long as you can handel Garrett's alpha male, condescending attitude.	2004-04-25

I don't often rate a book 5 stars but given this is a Harlequin Romance I think this book is excellent. The witty,snappy dialogue and the great characters make this book a huge cut above the usual series romance novel. The bride assignment will also appeal to those who love romance but don't like graphic sex. In fact, this is the first romance I have read in a LONG time that didn't go beyond kissing. But there was none of that horrible teasing that you get in so many romance novels where all the characters think about is sex until your thinking, \\"Just do it already!!\\" Instead, this book concentrates on witty conversation and slow developing friendship and romance. I really enjoyed reading it!	2004-04-22

But a little ways into the book he started pulling all sorts of macho BS. Then he acts like a jerk (reporting Sophia's friend as a way to stay close to Sophie with no thought to Sophia's friend). Then he starts acting stupid (grilling steaks, etc.). So I became discusted with him. But then towards the end I started liking him again and I really liked him at the end. Go figure.<br />I wouldn't pay money for this book but I think its fine for getting from the library. I started working in the early 1980s and I can attest to the sexual discrimination that went on back then. In fact, I thought the B story line involving Sophia's friend was more interesting than the A story line. However, Sophia's solution of falsifying a resume was downright immoral. Note to readers - Do not try that in real life! It could get you into big trouble.	2004-04-20

The heroines are so wimpy and the heroes are such macho jerks that I find them unreadable. The stories in Worth the Risk are not that bad. Yes, the women are a little too submissive and the men a little too condensending but I have read much worse.<br />The Challoner Bride was the weaker of the two. It had just enough supernatural element to make you go &quot;HUH?&quot; but not enough supernatural element to make it interesting. I didn't like the male lead all that much either. It was his way or the highway and he always knew what was best for the little lady. Yuck. <br />Wizard was better but there was still the lead male being all macho and possesive and the heroine wimping out (and even enjoying it). That's so dated!<br />Still, these stories were written by Jayne Ann Krentz which means you at least have interesting characters and snappy dialogue. That's a lot more than you get with most romances coming out of the 1980s.	2004-04-20

He was just way too controlling. I guess if your secret fantasy is to have a husband dictate every aspect of your life then this may be the hero for you. These days, this kind of hero only works in some sort of erotic BSDM story but not in some simple little candelight romance! Anyway, I try to read romances written no later than 1990 but if your a fan of 1980s romance you would probably enjoy this one. I just wish at some point it was acknowledged that Angie's intuition about staying in Mexico had been correct. For some reason it bugged me that she never said, &quot;Told you so!&quot;	2004-04-17

I love a book with snappy, witty dialogue and Lady's Choice doesn't disappoint. I also felt that Julianna and Travis made a good couple that I could see staying together for the rest of their lives (always a good quality in a romance!). There were a couple of problems with this book that some people might find hard to swallow. One problem was the moral ambiguity. The hero starts off carrying out revenge and even though he gets over his anger neither he nor Julianna ever admit that what he did was morally wrong. Even worse are Julianna's family. What they did was absolutely immoral (it makes me mad to even think about it) yet they never even admit they did anything wrong and never try to make ammends. How are we suppose to feel anything but disdain for them? I especially disliked Julianna's weak cousin who I think we are actually meant to like. Another thing about this book that may bother readers is the personality of the heroine. I almost stopped reading the book after the fist couple of chapters because Julianna was so abrasive. It definitely took several chapters before I could get over her almost psychotic behavior at the beginning. But I did eventually warm up to her and I must admit, I have always loved a strong heroine who has absolute faith in her mate. All in all I think the strong points of this book far outweigh the negatives and I highly recommend Lady's Choice (good title BTW).	2004-04-14

There were several plot points in this book that I didn't like. First, the plot seemed slow and boring. Second, I guessed the unstable (psycho) out to kill the hero even before the character appeared on the page. What is it with all these Blaze books where a pscho is trying to kill a main character? Anyway, third, I did not like the way the \\"hero\\" does a 180 degree turn after they (finally) have sex. And he has no proof! I hate characters (male and female) that turn into jerks after having sex although usually it's the woman who does it in romance novels. <br />I also didn't like the character of Josie. She's smart but in ten years she couldn't figure out she had been raped? Wasn't she ever concerned that he was out abusing other women? I couldn't buy the fact that in all that time her loving parents and friends hadn't picked up on the fact she needed psychiatric help. The set up of this book would have made more sense if she had been in the process of receiving professional help for her problem.<br />Finally, I don't think this should be a Blaze book. The slow, sexual pace of the book made it feel much more like an intrigue book. And like I said before, even the intigue here is pretty thin.	2004-04-03

I HATE &quot;by the book&quot; , can't break rules type of people and that's what Ellen is (until the end of the book of course). I thought I would scream if I read &quot;he's not the one&quot; one more time. In fact, I started skimming the book pretty early on (I couldn't bring myself to just throw the book away because unlike Ellen, I can't afford to just buy books to throw them away. I feel like I actually need to read them.)<br />I gave the book two stars because the mystery weekend was a pretty good setup even if nothing very interesting happened.	2004-04-03

I've read quite a few Blaze books that were so thin on plot and characterization that I had a difficult time getting through them. This book had just enough to keep me going and the sex was good which is about all I expect in a Blaze book.<br />Although the book kept me interested I must say I was also confused. Why had Sebastian been in lockup? What was his crime? Why hadn't he been put in the foster care system? It's understandable how Sebastian's childhood would mold him into the isolated character he becomes but it seems to me it would take more unusual circumstances and a whole lot stronger woman than Erin to bring him into the world of the living. Erin is a likable but weak character and there is no way I could believe that her and Sebastian could fall in love. There was so much potential with Sebastian's character that I was dissapointed that he ended up in this shallow book with weak characters. <br />The story with Cali and Will was strange too. It started off really good and made a great contrast with the Erin and Sebastian story. Then it started going down this weird path where Cali and Will started fighting over a script. It ruined the whole romance for me. If they were getting that worked up over a homework assignment it didn't bode well for their long term relationship. Where was the caring and willingness to compromise that should have been there? I don't see their romance going beyond a few months. And I still don't understand how Erin and Sebastian's ever got going.	2004-04-02

The story itself was pretty ridiculous but kept me entertained.My only major complaint was that I was never convinced that Joan and Bryce would ever really make it as a couple once the initial passion went away. On the other hand, they were both nice but rather shallow characters and make a very cute couple. On a side note, this is the second Blaze book I've read in a row where some nut case was trying to kill the main characters. What's up with that?	2004-03-31

First, it was hard to read a book where everyone was so stuck in the past. I understood why Colin and Winnie would hold grudges but what was everyone elses problem? Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in a small town but I couldn't understand why anyone else would still have a problem with Sugar Beth. Especially the Seawillows, they were her partners in crime yet they don't seem to attach any blame to themselves! So she stopped hanging around them when she went off to college. Big deal! Why are they still hurt by that? Maybe if you grew up in a small town or community and you still live there this book would hit all the right notes. For me, there was a lot here I didn't get(I don't even remember who the rich b---ch in my high school was). I identified most with the character of Jewel who was the only one who seemed to be living in the present and not in the past.	2004-03-29
US	38632362	R1RAX0HKBOAAVY	0743467205	434856140	Honey Moon	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Intense but good	If you've never read a Susan Phillips book and you enjoy light, fun romance (as I do), DO NOT let this be your first SEP novel! This book is intense with a lot of emotionally difficult things going on. Instead I recommend Breathing Room, Heaven Texas, It Had To Be You, First Lady or Lady Be Good. I do not normally enjoy novels like Honey Moon. The characters here are mostly emotional messes who are still being heavily influenced by the bad things that happened to them when they were young. But, as always SEP does a fantastic job showing their growth and healing. I did think that Honey and Eric's falling in love with each other was way too abrupt. I really would have liked to see them become gradual friends who helped each other heal over a longer period of time before they became lovers. I was also a bit disturbed by the relationship between Honey and Dash. Not the fact that their relationship turned to a rather co-dependent love (stuff like that happens) but that while Honey was allowed to grow and form a healthy, mature relationship with Eric, Dash was not. He was killed off while still a washed up actor with very little respect. I felt SEP did his character a diservice and it was frustrating for the book to spend so much time with him and he ends up as he does. I almost gave the book three stars for that point alone. But, overall I thought the book was very good and I recommend it if you are looking for a romance with intensity and darkness. Oh, and I have to say one more thing. I appreciate so much that all the characters actions in this book make sense. There are no stupid misunderstandings and all the characters stay in character. Thank you Ms. Phillips!!	2004-03-29

I loved all the characters (even the special agents) and I really liked the road trip set up. The only thing that bugged me was that Mat did not tell Nealy that she had left her keys in the car. What kind of jerk wouldn't tell someone that!? And he knew there was a disreputable looking man nearby. I had a much more difficult time than Nealy of forgiving Mat for that.<br />SEP does a wonderful job of developing and showing the growth of both Mat and Lucy. I especially loved the way she took Lucy from being snotty and rebellious to loving and mature. Well done! The only problem I had was with the character of Nealy. In the book she goes from total burn out to ready to jump back into politics with both feet. That's a good set up but I never really saw the change going on in her. So at the end it was difficult to understand why she would want to go back and get even more involved.I mean, is there really such a thing as a politician who doesn't enjoy the power and fame involved? Because those seem to be the only compensations (along with financial secuity) to a life almost devoid of privacy.<br />I am a complete sucker for happy endings so of course I LOVED the ending. Thank you Ms. Phillips!	2004-03-25

Although there are all sorts of serious circumstances here (penniless orphan, man accused of murder, illegitimacy, etc.)Ms. Darcy gives this book an extreme light touch. Its in the style of Georgette Heyer and I enjoyed it very much.<br />This book is primarily about Eugenia, the penniless yet always resourceful heroine. I found her sunny disposition and pluckiness delightful. I only gave this book four stars though because I felt that the hero Richard wasn't fully fleshed out. He had great qualities but there really wasn't that much interaction between the two main characters so the romance part of the book suffered a bit. But if you're in the mood for a fun, light romance I recommend this book.	2004-03-22
US	38632362	R2M0Z90834GCZZ	0061032093	602976816	Breathing Room	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of my favorite romances	The first three chapters were downright depressing but after that I smiled my way through most of the rest of the book. The witty dialogue reminded me of one of those screwball comedies from the 1930s like &quot;Topper&quot; or &quot;Bringing up Baby&quot;  -- so much fun!! This was the kind of romance where the two main characters enjoy the heck out of each other and you know that they will have a happy and lasting marriage. (I hate romances where the &quot;hero&quot; treats the heroine like dirt until the second to the last page where suddenly he declares his undying devotion.)Isobel and Ren start off on the wrong foot but they are able to mend the fences very quickly. I especially loved the character of Isobel. Sure she was a control freak, but she was willing and able to bend and grow. And Ren was the perfect man to help her to do it. I found Isobel to be the most mature heroine I've ever read about. And I mean that in a good way. And just because her life was in shambles doesn't mean she couldn't continue to be a good councilor - psychologists do it all the time. It's called being a professional.<br />This book was not without its faults but I found the problems easy to forgive. I thought this was one of the best romance books I have ever read and definitely the best SEP novel. I highly recommend it.	2004-03-08

This book dealt more with the seamier side of Regency London and human nature. The plot was pretty good.<br />What I didn't like:<br />Although I liked the fact that the author was trying to write a more realistic book, it seemed to trudge on and on without any humor or lightness.If the book had been more interesting I wouldn't have minded the darkness of it (for example, I love the mother of all romance novels \\"Jane Eyre\\"). Unfortunately, I found this book to be boring and the main characters uninspiring. I hated the way Patrick took Elise's virginity without any intention of marrying her. I really didn't like him at all. And for someone who is suppose to be smart and rich, Elise doesn't seem to have a clue about affecting a positive change in the world. I didn't blame her for that - at least she was trying- but it was still frustrating. Finally, I did not find this book to be very sensual at all. Most of the sex was degrading and left me with an icky feeling. Overall the book was a disappointment.	2004-03-04

But for me it always seems that an author's idea of fantasy sex is not really mine. So most of the time it comes off alittle flat. For example, one of the sex fantasies in this book was to have sex in a cabin in the woods. That just seems a little ho-hum to me. But the scene in the restaurant was ooh-la-la! There are four different fantasies in this book so I would think that at least one should appeal to most everyone.	2004-02-27

The only character who wasn't immoral was Kevin Tucker. All the other secondary characters were just plain sad or dispicable. As for the main characters Jane and Cal - Yikes! Cal is a jerk. It's totally understandable that he is furious with Jane but to want to destroy the mother of his future child is not only stupid it's also not a character trait you want to see in a leading man. He also shows his stupidity by not protecting himself while having sex with a potential wacko groupie with some unknown agenda. Yet the fact that he had unprotected sex is never mentioned again. He certainly never assigns himself any blame. Then there is the \\"genius\\" Jane. If she had any smarts, she certainly didn't show it in the first third of the book. She's a researcher but when it comes to genetics or sperm banks or Cal Bonner she doesn't do any research. First of all, even I , a simple engineer knows that genetics can be a real crap shoot. The probability of having genius offspring is incredibly small no matter who the parents are. Also, men who donate to sperm banks come from many different backgrounds - not just med students. Finally, if Jane was so concerned with the sperm donor's intelligence why didn't she do any research into Cal's background (besides health history). Jane's actions simply made no sense.<BR>     The other thing that I hated about the first part of the book were the two sex scenes. They were brutal and sad and really made me despise both Cal and Jane.<BR>     It was not a good beginning for a book. The only thing that kept me reading was that I really liked \\"Heaven Texas\\" and \\"It Had To Be You\\". So I kept reading and along about page 175 or so an amazing thing happened. The book actually began to get really good. Jane developed a backbone and Cal lightened up. The interactions between Cal and Jane became warm and funny. The secondary characters were good (with some real depth) and some of the situations had me laughing out loud. By the end of the book I had no trouble believing that Jane and Cal would have a good marriage and be decent parents. <BR>     So, how do I rate this book? Well, the first 1/3 gets zero stars and the last 2/3 gets 4.5 stars. Overall - 3 stars.	2004-02-26

I really got the sense that they made a good team and would have a good marriage. I also felt that Jocelyn had a good reason to lie about the marriage and even a good reason to keep the deception going. I would give this part of the book 5 stars. <br />What I didn't like:<BR>       After reading the prologue and 1st chapter my thought was, \\"What? Are these two still in Junior High School?\\" They both are very attracted to each other (and NOT just in a sexual way) yet after six months neither of them has done the first thing about it. My biggest problem was Jocelyn's decision to resign with no explanation rather than be blackmailed. That made absolutely no sense! If she is leaving anyway there is no more harm done if she tells Lucas how she feels. At the very least she should tell him about his step brother plotting against him. And Lucas's reaction to her resignation was so stupid and immature. Fortunately for the book, The personalities of the two main characters improve 100% after the accident. Although Jocelyn continue to stupidly hide the actions of his step brother from Lucas. <BR>All in all, I felt this book wasn't bad.	2004-02-26

Not very much history was given about Gray but since this is a Silhouette Romance and not War and Peace that's not that big an issue. I loved the interactions between Catherine and Gray and the slow build of the romance which culminated in some very steamy sex scenes! I also liked the fact there were no bad guys in this book.

She is the equivalent of a person in a horror movie who goes into the haunted house for no reason but to show &quot;they ain't afraid of no killer ghosts!&quot; Why does Lisa marry a man who scares and threatens her and shows all the hallmarks of an abusive husband? And as for her &quot;love interest&quot; Thorn.... all I can say is very, very scary. If there was an afterward for this book describing their marriage five years later it would probably show Lisa on trial for murdering her mentally abusive husband. The housekeeper Mrs. Kirk would testify that she was never more horribly surprised in her life as when she found Mr. Landers dead in his bed all torn and bloody with the normally quiet, timid little Lisa sitting in a corner singing to herself and holding the bloody knife. Mrs. Kirk would give a deep sigh and say,&quot; She was such a happy little thing when she first came to stay - sigh - so happy.&quot;	2004-01-25

Bravo Mrs. Fielding! I am so tired of the heroines in these books having high profile up-scale jobs but not having the sharp, intelligent personalities that should go with the jobs. In this book Rose is sharp, witty, personable, fearless and tenacious just as she would have to be to be successful at her job. I also love that she was able to laugh at herself. All in all I felt confident that she would be able to fit into her role as described at the end of the book. Prince Hassan was not too badly written and I enjoyed much of the banter between the prince and Rose. <br />What I didn't like about the book:<BR>The plot of the book was ridiculous at best and in poor taste at worst. Considering that several journalist in the mideast have been kidnapped, tortured, and even killed I found Rose's predicament to be unromantic. The fact that she falls in love with her captor is a psychological syndrome NOT romance! And the princes actions make no sense. Why would he personally kidnap her and not immediately tell her his reasons. He should be doing everything he can to gain her coorperation so that she doesn't turn on him once he lets her go. He doesn't seem to realise that she could get the world to turn against him and his brother once she is free. The whole plot is built on a house of cards that comes tumbling down with the slightest breath. <br />My main complaint:<BR>Rose is a smart, mouthy person yet she shies away from telling Hassan how she feels about him towards the end. It was so out of character. I would have liked it so much better if they had had a frank discussion of the problems that would be involved with them getting married. They didn't talk about religion, culture, being a royal or anything. It made for a very dissatisfying ending. I realise that romance novels are about fantasy but this onetakes it to the extreme.	2004-01-25

I'm sorry but I could not identify with or feel sorry for this poor little rich girl with the perfect body. If she had truly become independent and had gotten over her teenage obsession I could have respected her. But as it was she was really pathetic. Why would someone move in with a boyfriend without having sex with him first or even being physically attracted to him ? The \\"hero\\" was a jerk and a user and I figure I would give their marriage two years on the outside. Sad excuse for a book.	2004-01-22

This book would have been much better if the woman had been smart and savvy. As it was she was like a sheep who would try to rebel now and then and get into worse trouble. I hate books like this! There was pretty good sexual tension but there was nothing to back it up. Boring book.	2004-01-17

When I was young and ambitious Kate may have irritated me because her ambition is to be a housewife. However, reading this now as a stay-at-home mom I completely sympathized with her.	2004-01-12
US	38632362	R1JTOCK2YS64OL	0263782247	573124716	Rescued	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Terrible	The main characters of this book, Clancy and Luke, were awful! Clancy contantly lied to herself. She really needed to get some therapy. And Luke was domineering to the point of abuse. Luke started to boss Clancy around from the first time they met and it only got worse. Clancy was suppose to be a strong independent person but there was no evidence of this in the book. She was emotionally damaged and it was scary to see Luke take over her life. Not recommended.	2004-01-12

I loved that Rourke wasn't perfect and I loved how they were both so willing to admit when they were wrong. This was a couple that I could actually see staying together after the &quot;in love&quot; stage burned out. In fact, the only thing that seemed difficult to believe was that they had worked and traveled together for almost a year before they discovered their attraction. However, that is a very minor quibble in an overall very nice book.	2004-01-12

I can understand her being hurt and deeply embarrassed by the cruel rejection she received at Clay's hands at the tender age of sixteen. However, it was just a kiss and some heavy petting - just one incident. To hang on to the hurt for twelve years is very unhealthy to say the least! And to have Robyn hang on to anger and hurt for almost the entire book is just plain boring and frustrating for the reader. Do yourself a favor and skip this book.	2004-01-12

What I didn't like about the book:<BR> Michelle comes off as terribly shallow. She's rich and pampered and the whole idea of her pretending to be poor in Paris is rather sickening. The worst part is that Michelle and Nikos take no action to prevent the stalker from hurting anyone else. They don't seemed concerned at all when he relocates to a different area to potentially prey upon another victim. <br />What I liked about this book:<BR> It was hot, hot, hot!!! The author did a brilliant job keeping up the sexual tension throughout the book. Helen Bianchin definitely has a talent for erotica.<br />Story - 2 stars<BR>Character - 2 stars<BR>Sexual Heat - 5+ stars!!	2004-01-12

Matt was pretty much an arrogant jerk throughout the book and Jessica's integity was lacking. I still don't understand why Jessica liked Matt anyway.I also tend to hate any book that has the \\"hero\\" having sex with other women, especially after he has met the \\"heroine\\". And I do not care to read about anyone else having sex besides the two main characters. In this book there are many such sex scenes written in great detail (yuck). The only redeeming part of this book was the romance between Adam and Gwen. I really wish the whole book had been about them!	2003-12-17
US	38632362	R1F70T4C2V85U4	0505522659	380256462	Knight of a Trillion Stars (Futuristic Romance)	Books	1	9	12	N	N	Terrible!	This book inspired a very strong emotion in me. Unfortunately that emotion is anger. I'm angry that I paid money for this truly horrible book! To begin with, the plot was practically non-existent, the main characters were dangerously stupid, and worst of all the sex scenes were bland and completely boring. If you enjoy reading hot, erotic sex scenes, believe me you can do so much better than this! Try \\"Secrets Volumes 1-8\\" or Lisa Cach, Deborah Simmons, Linda Howard, and many others. I actually found some of the sex scenes here offensive since they almost went over the line of being rape. However in general, the sex was just plain ho-hum.<BR> If it was just the sex that was bad I could have gotten over it. For me, great characters and an exciting plot can more than make up for other deficiencies. In this book however, not just one but both of the main characters are blithering idiots. The \\"heroine\\" of the book, Deana, is so passive she is almost childlike (another gross out factor in the sex scenes). The other characters treat her like a child and well they should since she acts like one. Much of the so called humor of the book involves Deana doing something stupid and everyone laughing at her. For me it was just embarrassing. But for me as a science fiction fan, Deana's worst sin is she has no curiosity. Here she is, going where no human has gone before (to coin a phrase), and she shows almost no interest. This was especially amazing given that she is supposed to be a science fiction writer. Actually I think this is consistent with her totally passive, bland personality. To be fair, Deana does have one redeeming characteristic - she has a wonderful ability to laugh at herself.<BR> The \\"hero\\" Lorgin is one of the most immature main characters I've ever read about in a romance novel. He is so secure in his arrogance that he simply cannot conceive that he could ever be wrong about anything. This trait is especially dangerous since saying he's not the sharpest pencil in the box is a gross understatement. Usually cardboard characters like this are minor characters included in the book to provide comic relief. In this book, he is supposed to be the sexy leading man - lucky Deana. He does so many things that are completely juvenile like refuse to pronounce Deana's name correctly and cause a plane to almost crash because he is bored. That reminds me, Lorgin is supposed to have all these neat powers but he never uses them to help them out. So besides being immature, arrogant and stupid he is also useless! I kept hoping Lorgin would trip and fall down a chasm or something and Rejar would become the leading man. The book could have only improved.<BR> This book is an all around stinker - don't waste your money on it!	2003-09-24
US	38632362	R139IM0VCE6HVK	0425188361	549489959	Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Highly Enjoyable	First of all, if you have not read any other Anita Blake book do yourself a favor and read Guilty Pleasures first. This is not the type of series that you can just pick up in the middle. Also be aware that this series is full of intense violence and sex, along with action, wit, and romance. If you liked Sigorney Weaver in Aliens then you are going to love Anita Blake!<br />For those that have read the other 10 books, CS picks up where NIC left off and continues on in much the same vein (so to speak :-)). If you absolutely despised NIC you probably will not like CS. I thought NIC was pretty good and I liked CS even better.<br />What I loved about CS:<BR> I love the way the characters continue to grow and develop in this book. In so many series, the main characters either stagnate or become caricatures of themselves as the series advances. But in the Anita Blake series, the characters are becoming more real and complex. It's wonderful! It's so much fun to think about what the real motivations are and where these characters will be heading. Even Richard has begun to grow and I must admit I still have hope that he and Anita will form a relationship that will be even stronger than before.<BR> I also loved the sex in this book. I thought there was just the right amount of sex and it was very erotic and well done. I never thought I would like the fact that Anita is having sex with more than one man but in CS the sex seemed very natural and relevant to the book. So many people have criticized how much sex is in CS that I went back and counted the pages. I counted approximately 27 pages of sex (in the French sense) being described. If you add in all prose of an erotic nature you probably come up to about 50 pages max. 50 Pages out of 400 does NOT seem like an excessive amount to me! Please keep up the good work Ms Hamilton (and could you try to include Damian somewhere :-)).<br />What I didn't like about CS:<BR> Although the book is highly readable and enjoyable I saw many signs of sloppiness. The plot was rather weak and at one point there was a time disconnect. The book end B plot was not well integrated into the A plot which made it feel disconnected and abrupt. Finally, the use of  a dues ex machina  (once again a major character effortlessly acquires a new power) to resolve the A plot seems lazy. Please Ms Hamilton, this series is too good to shortchange it this way. Give us a plot like Guilty Pleasures along with the character development of CS and you will have one outrageously fantastic book!	2003-09-13
