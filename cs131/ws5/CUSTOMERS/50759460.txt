A bit disjointed, uneven - not every story is good, no story is great.  This being my first foray back into crime writing since renouncing the genre after a bad meeting with an account of the Bernardo murders (I believe they were known as the Ken and Barbie killers in the Yoo Ess of Aye), I swore I wouldn't bother again.<br />But this collection seemed sedate enough, with credits from such magazines as GQ, Harper's and Vanity Fair.  The pieces collected are well-written for the most part, but vary from being only mildly interesting to boringly lurid.<br />I'm looking forward to my next read.	2003-12-27

I'm a big fan of Carol Shields, having enjoyed Larry's Party, The Stone Diaries, even adding Swann to my wicked Top Five list - but this one didn't hit the spot.<br />Although the stories were charming and well-written, they weren't engrossing. I need to be EN-GROSSED! Instead I felt like I was wading through the bad stuff (I use the term &quot;bad&quot; for effect only) to get to the good. Some real gems here, but not a stellar collection.<br />Somewhat recommended - that is, to fans, and not just the casual passerby.	2001-09-22

To be honest, it wasn't as funny as The Wishbones - a novel that just had me bursting out laughing anywhere I picked it up for a read. It wasn't as intelligent as Election - Election was just a genius piece of satire. But this was still good, fun reading.<br />It's a snapshot of college life and all guilt that comes with the person you are changing into during these years of your life. I'm not sure I can explain that well enough, and will just hope that some of you will know what I mean. The guilt that you feel over your parents paying, the guilt that comes with drifting away from friends that are less fortunate, the guilt of a messy room, old boyfriends. I'm sad that I've read all I can by this man.<br />I'm going to keep looking for that short story collection of his and just hope he's got a book coming out sooner than later.	2001-09-22

If you liked &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; that's all fine and fabulous, since a review compared these two novels. I hated AA, but loved this book. I ripped through it in three days and was sobbing for the last 70-something pages. I had to stop here and there to marvel at what a talented writer Azzopardi is. Okay, the narrator is Dolores, who for reasons I won't spoil here, was burned in a fire at age one month. This is what she says of her burned hand. Luca is her sister.<br />&quot;I used to think my hand would grow back. I'd watch for signs. At night, I'd will the fingers to sprout, eating up the vacant space like a bloom captured on a time-lapse camera. So I know what will and won't grow back, and I know now when Luca is lying.&quot;<br />There's a theme running through this book of lost things, absences, silent spaces, and something odd about damaged body parts. I want to say it's Atwoodian (my own word), but I won't. Azzopardi's writing is much more innocent, especially since her narrator is remembering things from childhood on. Although some of her views are bitter, they are never expressed so. You almost wish Dolores had been hardened by her experiences. Growing to love this narrator is painful, because we can't reach into the pages and comfort her.<br />This was such a beautiful book that the conclusion, no matter how satisfying, was unwelcome. A superfantastic effort!	2001-09-22

Shallow? You bet your bookmarks.<br />However, my on-line book group was scheduled for a discussion of The Red Tent, hence giving me one more reason to spend 20 bucks I didn't have.<br />Notwithstanding my appalling ignorance of all things Biblical, despite my rabidly Catholic upbringing (I wanted to be a disco nun), I know nothing beyond the book aside from Diamant's skill as a writer and the resounding voice she lent Dinah. She not only creates a compelling woman out of the cardboard woman we meet in the Old Testament, but brought to life a cast of women worthy of the many uninteresting male figures who overshadow them in the big book.<br />One complaint: The story turns too far into the lives of those outside of Dinah's family - her mothers recede into the background. Because of this, Diamant digresses into what is largely uninteresting, at the expense of the interesting.<br />I wanted to know more of the two-dimensional Jacob, whom I like to call Milksop in Sandals, and Shalem the Stallion, Dinah's first hubby.<br />But who the hell cares, read the book. It's good enough, and her name is Dinah. Dee-nah.	2001-09-10

Not a bad book in all - well written with Cohen's  usual flair, but just not zingy enough.  It sort of meandered along with the main character, Paul - a gimp of a protagonist with a noodle for a spine.  I just hated him.  In love with a junkie named Judith (oh please hand me a tissue) who in turn deceives him and treats him like the doormat he subconsciously wants to be.  Now, that's all fine and fair.<br />But how sentimental and repitive can a book get??  This one, after reading two good ones by Cohen, was about as refreshing as a sewer breeze or one of those massive subway farts that happen in big and overly-populated cities.  The go-nowhere plot had me more interested in my cuticles and screwing metal splinters into my eye sockets than in where these repugnant dolts would wind up by the end of the story.  A quarter of the way through I just wanted Judith to overdose on self-pity and for Paul to get beamed up by a sadistic anal-probe spacecraft from the planet Buttron.  As much as I try to support Canadian writers in general, and especially a good writer like Cohen, I cannot in good conscience ever recommend this book.  Dull dull DULL dull DULL DULL DULL.<br />Two stars for (A) lyrical writing and (B) 'cause Cohen is Canadian, eh.	2001-08-18
US	50759460	R330IDQCZMJ4G0	0425169715	771227214	The Wishbones	Books	5	1	3	N	N	A stylish moral comedy	Another fantastic novel by Tom Perrotta!<br />After reading &quot;Election&quot;, I knew nothing this man wrote could fall short of engrossing, and I was right.<br />Although &quot;The Wishbones&quot; is an easy read, it is one which still offers a critical reading into the lives and choices of the characters within.  However, I'd say that this book is almost deceivingly simplistic.  Perrotta sneaks all these mundane scenes in, such as two characters (prospective son- and father-in-law) watching TV together, and you'll probably wonder why you're reading a scene of two grown men who are incapable of communicating with one another on a common level.  But with Perrotta, it's all about detail.  Pay attention to the small things that aren't so small.  Suddenly the scene becomes a farce, a comic tableau of what it means to be family, of how it feels for young Dave, a modern Everyman, to be sitting next to the old guy who recently caught him boinking his 30 year-old daughter in the rec room, with nothing on but a hot pink condom and a pained expression.<br />Here is a young guy who feels as if the huge weight of an impending wedding is bearing down on him, while the TV shows a history program recounting the last days of WWII, complete with snapshots of tankers looming in the foreground.  Cut to another part of the world on the small screen and the Hiroshima bomb is spreading out in slow motion.  Perfectly executed!<br />&quot;The Wishbones&quot; is just this: the life of a young man spreading out like a bomb, and the effects of it - visually dazzling and beautiful from one perspective, horrific from another.<br />A second must-read from Tom Perrotta.	2001-02-13

I don't know if D.H Lawrence was just a man without breadth or depth of imagination, but why does this novel, over five-hundred pages long, only consist of throbbing, inflamed souls, and entangled sinners bonking in the haystacks?<br />You see, I'm a fan of D.H Lawrence, but I cannot comprehend whyever this book was (A) published and, (B), banned.  The Rainbow is a book that is simply TOO stuffed with Freudian thought, and simply TOO concerned with implied incest and the kind of base themes a perverted teen could think of in under ten minutes.  I completely and totally do NOT recommend this book.  If you want something definitive of Lawrence's career, read Sons and Lovers.  The same themes are repeated there, but not quite as stupidly.	2001-01-31

By my choice of word (&quot;Finally&quot;), you can probably surmise that I'm not as thrilled with the outcome of the book as I was with the beginning and early progression.  What started out and even ended interesting, too often dissolved into nonsense and digression.  A very beautiful prosaic style was marred by obsessive detail, too.<br />One other problem, I think, was that we never get to see the Lisbon girls in any other way, but through the eyes of the neighbourhood boys that loved them.  This probably stifled some very interesting possibilities and leads me to question the voice of the narrator, how reliable he is, and to what extent he altered the story's truth, as well as to what extent he infused the story with his own fantasy.<br />I'm not at all sorry I read the book, or that I payed for it.  What I am sorry for is the time and patience I invested in reading it and not realizing sooner that half of it skimmed would not at all have taken away from the (yes, indeed) lyrical sadness, yet strong impact of the narrative as a whole.	2001-01-07
US	50759460	R2TKLY52GI014Z	0385491107	909928810	Life Before Man	Books	2	21	24	N	N	A sub-par effort for an outstanding author	Being a loyal Atwood fan, I decided to read the last of her unread novels recently.  The title of the novel, Life Before Man, held the dark tones of mystery that I appreciate in literature; the hint of scandal, intrigue, or just the promise of what Atwood is so good at dishing up: a rich and intricate tale woven around several characters.  This would not have been unlike my favourite novels by Atwood, Cat's Eye, Lady Oracle, and The Robber Bride.  I thought that with Life Before Man, I had saved one of the best for last.  I was wrong.<br />What ensued in the next 400 pages was an embarrassing love triangle involving three warped and morally repugnant morons.  Even all the sinnin' and flirtin' couldn't save this book from falling flat on its face.  The story became not only frustrating, but agonizingly boring - the development of any sympathetic or likeable characters was bogged down by over-tedious use of language and metaphor.<br />The story did not challenge new borders in literature and failed to violate *my* expectations as a reader.  I was more interested in the page count and, sometimes, in the sparse poetic quality of the novel, than what was happening to the three main characters. By the end of the book, I was too disappointed to complain about the lack of resolution and was only glad to say that I'd finished what I'd begun.<br />A valuable read for true Atwood fans interested in noting the evolution of her work between then and now, but not a book to cluck cluck cluck over.  Two-and-a-half stars.	2000-09-30

I'd heard enough about Anne Perry to ignore my recent reads to  begin this little novel.<br />The Cater Street Hangman, set in late Victorian  England, details the brutal murders of six young women in a middle upper  class neighbourhood called Cater Street. Mystery abounds and Inspector Pitt  arrives on the scene to find out whodunnit. What unfolds is the question  &quot;Who didn't do it?&quot; as Perry throws out every red herring  possible since Oprah started gaining weight again.<br />Your pulse will race  with the turn of every page - guaranteed! Halfway through this formulaic  mystery, I was looking forward to reading the second book in the series,  Callander Square.<br />Please don't let the word 'formula' turn you off - this  is one author that knows how to stick to the expected without disappointing  her audience!<br />Elements of romance and details of the time period are  impressively handled. This is a must-read for all fans of the murder  mystery!<br />Dena	2000-09-05

If you're searching for a bit of fluff, this is not the book to turn to.  Although it isn't a difficult  read, it also is not a shallow one.  In fact, Margaret Atwood's searing and  relentless eye for detail is in its earliest stages here.  Any fan will  appreciate _Surfacing_.<br />In _Surfacing_, Margaret Atwood addresses the  issue of identity as reflected by the artifice around you - both in the  people you know and the person you are instructed to become.  Nothing in  this book is what it seems, but rather, it is a clever facade meant to  impart meaning to the reader.<br />The nameless narrator of _Surfacing_  engages in a deep journey into the wild bush of Northern Quebec, which  becomes a metaphor for her process of recovering self and identity.  The  land is used as a backdrop for the renunciation of a distorted self-image.  What this book ultimately does is provides us with insight into how we also  function as individuals and just what is it that makes us who we are?  Is  each human being just a pastiche?<br />Atwood gives you four fascinating  characters that are peeled apart to the core and, even though it is only  the main protagonist that goes through a physical journey in finding  herself, we also witness the psychic journeys of those around her and  realize what it means to be a man, woman, artist, a mother, father, wife,  husband, and sister.  No role is left untouched.<br />_Surfacing_ is also a  very entertaining book and can be read on many levels.  Highly recommended!	2000-07-07

It started off interesting, funny, meaningful - I thought he'd go somewhere  with it.  Off the deep-end?<br />  Absolutely NOTHING was accomplished with this  novel and I don't feel I've  gained anything from it.  The main character, Alexander Portnoy, simply  recounts a series of sexual encounters - with women, glass milk bottles,  pieces of raw meat - the whole book just turned into a  farce, needling in on  the same obsession over and  over.  Does everyone with an overbearing mother  sexually assault raw animal flesh?<br />  If this is  definitive Jewish-American literature, something is seriously  wrong and a re-assessment should be in order.  This garbage is  going  directly to my bird's cage.  Better lining than  literature.<br />Philip Roth has to be the greatest self-loathing Jewish man  alive, or at least one lucky enough to make a career out of it.	2000-06-13

Anne Sexton takes a grim and twisted approach to the already grim and twisted versions of the Grimm Brothers.<br />Of course, these poems are  simply an extension of Anne Sexton's already established confessional form,  but poetry is, first and foremost, an expression of society.  These poems  fail to remain part of Sexton's inner turmoil.  Rather, they mock society  and the roles that women are traditionally placed within fairy tales.  Anne  Sexton, in an example here, uses anachronisms to reach her audience, making  references to popular culture.<br />The Queen Cried two pails of sea water.  She was as persistent  as a Jehovah's Witness.<br />Anne Sexton,  &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;<br />Although Sexton's poems are not suitable for  an audience of children, they do serve as interesting, even necessary  reading, once a child has matured and read beyond the traditional fairy  tales that are `suitable' for kids.	2000-06-13

Though most of us grew up reading the Anne or Emily series by the same author, The Blue Castle is also a fantastic novel by Maud.<br />The story  focuses on 29 year-old Valancy, a presumed-doomed spinster who, at the  mercy of her family, is nearly falling to pieces.  Upon discovering she has  only a year to live, she decides to take charge of her life and her love.  What unfolds is a tale of passion and determination - one that is innocent  and inspiring!<br />You don't have to be a spinster to enjoy this book - you  don't even have to be Canadian, or a woman - this book will reach out to  any age group, sex, or class.  It's a simple story about following your  heart, and realizing that there is so much more to life than conforming to  someone else's idea of who you are or who you should be.<br />This is a  story everyone should read!	2000-06-04

This book sets a fine example for children (and adults) about the value of role reversal and what it can  teach us about the divide between the sexes.

Under normal circumstances, I would hail Stephen King as a great writer, at least within his own genre. He's imaginative, original and intelligent. But, &quot;Thinner&quot; was a horrible excuse for a book. It was written  more like a bad TV-movie than a story to be enjoyed by his hardcore fans.  Well, I'm not a hardcore anything.<br />Perhaps if the last half of the book  wasn't spent chasing the Gypsies Matlock-style it wouldn't have been so  bad. Needless to say, I was entirely bored with Halleck and Ginelli's  shenannigans(sp?).<br />Furthermore, I think Stephen King should watch his  ethnic stereotypes. All this book needed to validate it as a piece of dog  turd was the tiresome cliche that Ginelli was:a gangland type killer.

No matter  what order they were written in, they deal with a subject matter all too  similar. Perhaps Harrison didn't exercise her demons the first time and  decided to take another long-winded stab at it. I give this book four stars  because it's very well-written. One star off for pure redundancy. Just my  two-cents.	2000-05-04

Maybe my mind is too shallow for this deeply and subtley horrifying book, but the only thing reacting on my body was my skin. It was crawling with impatience. Silly dialogue, boring descriptions  and a slow-moving plot line made for a very dull read. Yawwwn. I'd rather  read TV Guide.<br />I expected a lot more from the writer of The Lottery.  Maybe too much. (November, 1998)<br />UPDATE: I re-read this book in December  1998 and it stands as one of my favourite novels of all time.  At the time  I was reading _Haunting_, I was already a fan of Jackson's and own all of  her available works.  I think that I was expecting to be scared in the  modern style we are now accustomed to.  However, upon re-reading, I  realized I really wasn't appreciating this book for what it was - deftly  subtle, quietly creeping upon you and terrifying the wits out of you.  The  evil lurks beneath the calm veneer that Jackson has crafted, like a hand  coming up out of a grave while you tend its flowers on a sunny day.	2000-05-04

I bought it at a used book store, fearing  the worst and then regretting paying full price for a work of trash.<br />Boy, was I wrong! The Stranger is one of the best books I've ever devoured. Albeit, it could have gone into more detail, given the story  and the characters more 'meat', however, I can't complain about it's  poignant quality.<br />Mersault: Idiot?  Victim?  Extraordinary?  This is  left up to the reader to decide, which I loved.  Mersault's actions made me  think of the isolation that comes with being different and indifferent.  Mersault did not CHOOSE to be indifferent, he was naturally.  Or so I  assume, because there never was an explanation for his decidedly rotten  behavior toward the people close to him.<br />I think this book's length was  a factor in letting the reader make their own judgements regarding Mersault  and his place in the theories of nihilism and existentialism. I STILL,  after having read the book months ago, haven't made a definite decision.  Hopefully, the conclusion won't come any time soon. I'm enjoying mulling  the story over in my mind and talking about it with my book-loving friends.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is beyond the idle fluff of such  writers as Dean Koontz and Jackie Collins. Feed your brain some oxygen.  You'll never think the same way about life again. ...	2000-05-04

What I love about her books is the fluid drawing out of interesting people, her characters are fleshed out into genuine characters  - it's like walking into a scene peopled with friends and family of your  own.<br />I did have one beef (or two) with the novel. I was hoping that Anne  would focus more on the relationship between Opal and Barnaby, for there  seemed to be no satisfactory closure there, or no real hint of what was to  come of their relation to one another.  Opal was a fascinating character!  As was Barnaby, of course - focussing on these two would have been the real  clincher in this book. Perhaps a sequel?<br />Also, the ending left me  confused . . . was he finally turning to Martine?  Was his last line a  realization of some sort, a discardment of Sophia? (Good choice: Sophia was  a dullard)<br />Read this book! I also recommend &quot;Dinner at the Homesick  Restaurant.&quot; :)	2000-05-04

(I'm writing this review years after first reading TBJ, and am not quite as worked up as I  was years ago.)<br />Unlike many other readers of Sylvia Plath, I read The Bell Jar as part of a class assignment in grade 12,  discovering her prose before her poetry. My first impression of Plath's  only novel was one of awe. It's simple style and detached narration make it  memorable in that it doesn't muddle the subject matter with melodramatic  statements or situations.<br />Sylvia Plath writes of her descent into  insanity with such coolness and ease, that it is utterly difficult to see  where she actually feels the Bell Jar starting to close in on her. Herein,  Plath deftly blurs the line between reality and madness.<br />Anyone who is  interested in a classic story, one that is touching and poignant, read The  Bell Jar. No other novel I have read so well explicates the human condition  as this one does. Wow.	2000-05-04

The worst thing about _The Ignored_ is not that it really was such a bad horror novel, but  that Bentley Little has ruined the concept for every other horror novelist  with more talent and devotion.  Very poorly executed - like an episode of  The Twilight Zone<br />And the redundancy? Page after page after page of being  reminded exactly what the diagnoses are for this lot of losers that Little  chose to leave as stagnant and boring card-board cut-outs of every American  breathing in the here and now.<br />I'm just sorry I bought it instead of  borrowing it from the library. I suggest you ignore this book and move on  to better novels. What little faith I have left in Little will go toward a  second chance - I hope that his novel _The House_ is better than _The  Ignored_.	2000-05-04

I bought this while on a trip in California and stayed up at night to read it on the bathroom floor while everyone else slept.  Totally worthwhile!  It's difficult not to be  drawn in to this man's tale of oppression and frustration - whether or not  you want to feel what it was to be Black in the past century, you will feel  it.<br />The issue of Communism toward the end of the novel caused me to  lose interest - both because I'm not politically-minded and not at all  interested in that sort of conclusion.  I wanted the protagonist to come  out a hero of sorts - instead the book becomes bogged down with politics  and the young man being dragged into a herd mentality that is a turn-off  for a reader looking for a meatier ending.<br />Also recommended: The  Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison	2000-05-04

But it's really just a backdrop for the author's knowledge of philosophy. Reads like a Phil 101  textbook.<br />It was a rehash of basic theories. Blah. He wove this cheap  girlish teen-squeal mystery story  around all the crap to make it look like  a novel.<br />Now that I got that out of my system: This book was a poor  excuse for a novel. A mere showcase and mediocre backdrop for the author's  regurgitation of the history of philosophy. Did he once inject his own  philosophic views?  Made me think of a piece of lint set against black  velvet: Absolutely nothing outstanding.<br />Basically rehashing a basic  textbook run, it's as if he were trying to convince himself that the money  he spent on phil 101 wasn't a waste by cutting and pasting this awful story  together. What a slapdash and muddy work of garbage!<br />I'm sorry I bought  it. If you're up for a heavy dose of melatonin and a night of rolling your  eyes in dismay, read Sophie's World.

Sure, some can argue  that the flowery prose and poetic quality of the story obscured honesty,  though I argue that this is precisely what gave birth to it. <br />It's hard  enough to write about such a sensitive topic without making it seem less  gritty than it really is. Harrison should be praised for the pinache and  integrity she pulled this tale off with. <br />I've moved on to her other  books because of &quot;The Kiss&quot;. I suggest others do the same!

I knew from chapter one that _Ladder of Years_ was a regular story, without literary pretensions or fancy schmancy trickery  designed to impress the reader or flatter our sensibilities.  It spoke of  the regular and the everyday - mostly of the small things that infuriate us  all: the condescending husband, the whinnying nagging unmarried sister of  the family, abrubt or impassive children.<br />The main character in this  novel, Delia Grinstead, does what we all, at one time or another, would  love to do.  On vacation with her family, she picks up her tote bag and  simply walks away from the only life she's ever known and begins a new one.  And it all begins with a rather unusual meeting with a stranger at the  grocery store.  This is a fine tale of the powers of time and perspective;  not just in the need to be alone, but in the need to be with new people and  in surroundings that do not require anything more than what you are willing  to offer.<br />_Ladder of Years_ addresses everyone's favourite fantasy of  erasing the past and becoming someone new, which is why it is so easy to  get lost in Delia's life, in her thoughts and feelings toward her family.  This is just a fantastic book, one that really picks up in the second half.  I had to read the last 200 pages in one sitting - even classics aren't  that attractive.  Anne Tyler has again managed to impress me with the  ordinary!<br />Aside from the import of this novel, Anne Tyler has managed to  draw out a great cast of characters.  I always say that the author's  characters are people you already know, or would (in some cases) like to  know.  Please read _Ladder of Years_.	2000-05-01

This book is neither interesting, engaging, or well-developed.  None of the characters gain sympathy or have any redeeming qualities.  Worst of all, the ending leaves you wondering why you  spent time reading the first 458 pages, since there is no closure (or even  a suggestion thereof) as to the fate of the characters.  I realize there is  a sequel, but a memoir should offer some sort of clincher to the story,  otherwise, the meaning is lost.<br />Also, when by some miracle the author  touches upon an interesting memory, he wraps it up within two or three  paragraphs, leaving you to re-read the paragraphs in order to escape the  onslaught of drivel to come.  It reads like a series of  snapshots.<br />Instead, _Angela's Ashes_ reads like a laundry list of deaths  by consumption and breakfasts of fried bread and tea.  Repeated  descriptions of chamber pots, lavatories, and oozing orifices made me feel  so ill that I had to gag up my own lunch. I only forced myself to finish it  because I paid enough for the paperback.  All in all, I'm disappointed and  stunned that anyone could hail this piece of garbage a classic.  Not I.  Save your money - _Angela's Ashes_ seems to be written with a stilted hand  that is anxious to follow in the path of traditional Irish tales of filth  and poverty.<br />Sadly, it doesn't even live up to the worst of the lot.	2000-04-24

I, too, found Lydia Brooke to be a flat, imitative character.  Too much about her and the audience she held with her psycho-sexual ego rang of Sylvia Plath.  Although, in the case of Lydia  Brooke, it resulted in a bad imitation, thanks to Deborah Crombie.<br />What  was even uglier was the continual reference to the supposedly destructive  relationship between Rupert Brooke and Virginia Woolf.  All in all, too  many things pointed at the Huges/Plath relationship.  If Crombie wanted to  detail the life of Plath, couldn't she have written another boigraphy,  without disguising it in this awkward mystery?<br />What kept me reading this  book was the likeability of Gemma and Duncan, and an empathy for the young  son of the murdered Brooke-biographer.  Beyond that, this book rounded out  into an atrocious ending, with no satisfactory motive, that left me feeling  dissatisfied and positive I wouldn't seek out Crombie's other mysteries.<br />I agree that 'bloody' was used far too much, sometimes twice in a  sentence.

However, on the whole, I found _Northanger Abbey_ to be a dull story, since it's an obvious imitation of more interesting gothic novels,  such as Ann Radcliffe's _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ and _The Italian_, which  I also just read.<br />From an intellectual standpoint, I'd read this book  again, and recommend it on that basis(probably because I read it for a  course).  But if you want a good and consistent gothic tale with an ending  as strong as the introduction, turn to Radcliffe for starters.  Austen's  book will give you other references worthy of checking out.<br />Three-and-a-half stars.	2000-04-11

By far, one of the best poetry anthologies I own - and well worth the money.  What's so wonderful about Ricks' anthology is it's attention to the greats of Victorian poetry, as well as highlighting some lesser-known  poets, like Swinburne, Ruskin, John Henry Newman, and the not-so-widely  read poetry of Hardy, Dickens, and Clough.<br />If you're a true fan of this  era, you'll appreciate the attention payed to the big greats: Tennyson,  Arnold, Hopkins, Browning, and the Rossettis.<br />I give this  four-and-a-half stars, actually.

I don't  understand whether Joshua was trying to refute Jewish stereotypes by  offering both sides of the debate, however, the debates offered were  unconvincing and not worth much more than the entertainment they offered  up.<br />A really interesting point Joshua made was the way the American  media, especially American comedy, cements Jewish stereotypes.  I wish he'd  write a book based on only that.<br />I wasn't expecting a great social study  and, therefore, am not disappointed at all with &quot;Schmoozing&quot;.

However, what unfolds in this slim  volume is a seamless story about a classless anti-heroine.  Amidst some  very sharp diction, biting humour, and poetic observations,  Tracy at once  emerges as a pathetic uber-student and silly femme fatale, a victim of the  loneliness ambition brings.<br />Though, it is not until halfway through the  novel that the reader learns how and why we feel sorry for Tracy.  Some  very painful glimpses behind Tracy's awards and achievements occur, but  rest assured that they do not happen in a soap operatic way - but rather,  they are implied with a single statment, one word, unwitting admissions by  Tracy herself.  The fact is, we find out how devastated she is by her  loneliness at the same rate she does - that's what makes this book so great  - we don't know anymore about Tracy than Tracy does at any given  point.<br />The ultimate impact of &quot;Election&quot; is an exacting  political satire and complex human portrait that is not without its jabs at  the American Dream and the inherently doomed and damnable American  Dreamer.<br />I look forward to reading Mr. Perrotta's other efforts.  Ten  stars, if possible!	2000-04-07

This book was somewhat of a struggle for me, though I am a giant Joyce Carol Oates fan.  I thought it wasn't possible, but &quot;Them&quot; is more of a brooding, dark, and realistic novel than Oates has pulled off  anywhere else in her career.  Here is a lot of characters that are in  constant danger of falling to pieces, of escaping one another, of realizing  their limits as individuals and as a family unit.  If you are not a reader  who can take a kick in the stomach, don't read this book.  However, if you  are willing to realize there is a hard edge to life which goes unrecognized  each day, pick this book up as soon as you can - Oates creates a world  fatalism and human conditions that are at once terrifying, yet beautiful:  it is hard to look away.

Durable Goods was a rather vague and disinterested fingering of what is going on in Katie's life.  I get it: she's a Texan  army brat, her father is abusive, mother died of cancer, sister is an  emotional iceberg . . . so where's the point?  Berg seemed to gloss over  the meat of this story, filling the pages up with stupid little sentences,  ending each chapter with an emotional dip in narration.  Well, boo hoo.  The first chance Katie has to fix what is wrong in her life she backs out  on.  I was frustrated with her idiocy.  Okay, she's only 12, but are all 12  year olds this dumb? Perhaps only in Berg's world.<br />Everything about this  book, plot, characterization, tone, narration, was overly-simplified. I  liked it enough to finish it, but that's about where the affection ends.<br />The problem with this book, really, is that Berg has taken an eternally,  if somewhat cliched, subject matter and executed it horrendously.<br />Dena	1999-12-20

I should probably sue for my money back and tack on damages for mental  anguish.  Ew, ick!	1999-11-26

How could a man consistently persecuted as a writer of dumbed-down literature produce such a story?  It was wrought with humanity, beauty and the kind of pain and joy  that is often untouchable.  Words cannot express what this story will bring  to your mind, and cannot touch upon the warped ways we often miscalculate  the power of the human spirit.  You must read this book.	1999-11-26
US	50759460	R24I7FWIZGQV41	0804119163	832554018	Patchwork Planet	Books	4	9	14	N	N	Refreshing	I finished this book with a smile on my face - Anne Tyler never ceases to entertain.  What I love about her books is the fluid drawing out of interesting people, her characters are fleshed out into genuine characters  - it's like walking into a scene peopled with friends and family of your  own.<br />I did have one beef (or two) with the novel.  I was hoping that Anne  would focus more on the relationship between Opal and Barnaby, for there  seemed to be no satisfactory closure there, or no real hint of what was to  come of their relation to one another.  Opal was a fascinating character!  As was Barnaby, of course - focussing on these two would have been the real  clincher in this book.  Perhaps a sequel?<br />Also, the ending left me  confused . . . was he finally turning to Martine?  Was his last line a  realization of some sort, a discardment of Sophia? (Good choice: Sophia was  a dullard)<br />Read this book!  I also recommend &quot;Dinner at the  Homesick Restaurant.&quot;  :)	1999-11-19
US	50759460	R3VQYJDMNWMPM2	0451192583	284706036	The Ignored	Books	1	3	6	N	N	As average as the bland characters within	A fascinating premise with loads of potential, however, a very uninteresting development of plot and characterization.  What was the worst  thing about _The Ignored_ is not that it really was such a bad horror  novel, but that Bentley Little has ruined the concept for every other  horror novelist with more talent and devotion.  And the redundancy?  Page  after page after page of being reminded exactly what the diagnoses are for  this lot of losers that Little chose to leave as stagnant and boring  card-board cut-outs of every American breathing in the here and now.<br />I'm  just sorry I bought it instead of borrowing it from the library.  I suggest  you ignore this book and move on to better novels.  What little faith I  have left in Little will go toward a second chance - I hope that his novel  _The House_ is better than _The Ignored_.  Again, interesting concept,  albeit traditional - but we'll see where it goes.	1999-10-23

This book had everything - romance, intrigue, friendship and revenge.  Such a great combination.  I really did love this book, a second for me by Elinor Lipman, and much better than the  semi-drivel that was The Inn at Lake Devine. One thing bothered me about  Isabel's Bed - the absence of you-know-who by the end of the book.  The  Itzy-Hare-Pete-Costas combination should have ended with a collective bang!  Needless to state, I highly recommend this book!  It's a light and fast  read, packed with humour and realism.	1999-10-14

Can anyone really understand how this book won the PULITZER?  Mother of all that is good, who was the final jury on awarding  this book the PEW LIT ZER!!!?  Is it possible to retract?  I recommend  Shields' novel _Swann_, which is a real testament to her prosaic nature and  gift of storytelling.  But oh man, this book SUCKED!!  I only thank God  that I bought it at a used store.  Small miracles.	1999-09-28

Irving writes with a forced and awkward hand - there is no fluidity in this novel.  It is incoherent and utterly ridiculous.  The reader experiences no  satisfaction at the end of the book, not even considering the untimely  demise of the irritating Meany boy.  Ugh, if burning books weren't frowned  upon, guess which one would be roasting right now?  Go on, guess.	1999-08-16

It was choppy writing andelementary at best.  I couldn't concentrate on it because it was so boring and found myself wondering how many more pages were left until the torture would end.  Too bad someone didn't kill this BOOK off.  ew yuck, don't bother.And I'm actually a fan of MHC.	1999-08-06

How can so much happen to one person? This novel says a great deal about the cycles of violence and the gumption it  takes to say enough is enough.  This is a wonderful read, honest and  moving, despite it's intimidating page count.  Read this.	1999-07-29

What I loved most  about this book was the honesty with which is was written.  Sure, some can  argue that the flowery prose and poetic quality of the story obscured  honesty, though I argue that this is precisely what gave birth to it.  It's  hard enough to write about such a sensitive topic without making it seem  less gritty than it really is.  Harrison should be praised for the pinache  and integrity she pulled this tale off with.  I've moved on to her other  books because of &quot;The Kiss&quot;.  I suggest others do the same!  Congratulations, Kathryn.	1999-01-29

Is it that hard to believe that a woman could give birth to poems so incredibly rich and textured purely because she is mentally  capable to do so?  Of course not.  Therefore, why pigeon-hole Plath as an  over-emotional woman, who, rather than Windexing and cooking her troubles  away, chose to compose some of the most heralded lyrics of the twentieth  century?  It's difficult to excuse the Ariel poems as the simple mind-barf  of a harried, lonely woman.  Sylvia Plath was a genius.  Period.	1999-01-16
