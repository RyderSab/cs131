Nightseer was an ok read but it was certainly far from a wonderful or compelling read.<br /><br />Keleios was the typical unstoppable sorceress main character. The wounds she takes, and lives from, the enemies she fights, and the magic she spells is all straight from a Dungeons and Dragons video game. Her character is night invincible and she ALWAYS pulls off her spells whenever she needs to. 'Oh oh, the slime monster is coming but i need to finish this spell or else i will die!' (Spell is pulled off and saves her with a second to spare). Rinse and repeat through the novel.<br /><br />Also, what was with her relationship with Lothar? Did she want to kill him? Was she slowly growing to like him?<br /><br />And Nesbit? I thought he was a major villain that needed killing? But no, he is Keleios' brother-in-law and we never see him ever again...<br /><br />Nesbit screams for a sequel down the line but we shall see...<br /><br />All in all it was a average read but this was Hamiltons first novel, and it shows.	2005-09-27

This book, which is part 5 in Armstrongs great series, was a bit weird for me.<br /><br />The thing i love about Armstrongs Otherworld series is that the supernaturals are living directly underneath the noses of 'normal' humans without them even knowing it. The vampires and werewolves arent out of the closet like Hamiltons world.<br /><br />But this book puts a twist to that.<br /><br />Most of this book is spent in the 'ghost world' or afterlife. Where Fates, demons, supernaturals, and ghosts walk through walls, teleport to countries in seconds, and get punished by angels for being naughty. The setting of the afterlife takes some getting used to and seems a bit strange in some parts. Though i must admit that i liked some ideas like Hell being a paranoid place where you cant trust anyone...<br /><br />The story still manages to get a hold of you thanks to Armsrongs wonderful set of characters. Eve is a funny and powerful person and her character really oozes with charisma and personality. The ending also has a weird twist or two thrown in which makes it a bit of a surprise.<br /><br />Still, in the end i enjoyed the book a great deal but the supernatural afterlife setting was a bit 'new' to me.<br /><br />Id rather see a book about Eve Levine before Savannah was born and how she died in the compound. Kind of like a prologue of sorts. Now thats an idea...	2005-07-28

With this guide you are paying $5 for each game and you just cant beat that price, especially when you consider how massive each game is. But the saying 'you get what you pay for' holds true on this guide.<br /><br />The secret dungeon, Crossbone Island, of the first game is covered nowhere in this guide. Neither is the secret dungeon of the second game. What gives?<br /><br />And a world map, which is standard far for a massive rpg, is non existant too. It does give directions in text but these can be extremely vague in some parts.<br /><br />Also, there is no beastiary in the guide. Some of the rarest and best items in the game can only be gotten from enemies and this info is sorely missing with no beastiary.<br /><br />And the item database is pretty expansive but again, the best items in the game are missing.<br /><br />Though i have to give this guide credit. If youre stuck on a puzzle you can find the solutions in this guide in seconds. The solutions all have perfect pictures to guide you in the right direction.<br /><br />And last but not least, finding every single djinn in the game is made a snap with this guide. Every djinn has a bold box of info with a title that says DJINN ALERT. This makes it extremely easy to flip through the guide to find any djinn you missed and makes finding them a piece of cake.<br /><br />All in all this is a great guide for its 2-in-1 price.<br /><br />So while it isnt the best guide for those rare item hunters, it is great for the players that like to solve the game on their own and only use guides as a 'last resort' or to help on a tricky puzzle.	2005-06-14

Industrial Magic continues the story of the witches Paige and Savannah which started back in Stolen and Dime Store Magic.<br /><br />Paige and her new boyfriend Lucas relationship really 'blossoms' in this book and i can see them being together for quite some time. They grow quite a unique relationship together hunting the unnatural born killer of this novel. Each lead they get on the killer leads them down a dangerous path and not everything ends up as it seems. Besides themselves, just about everyone they know is in danger just by being associated with them.<br /><br />That leads to a suspenseful sense of not knowing who is the next 'target.'<br /><br />While the hunt for the killer was the main part of the book i was disappointed that my favorite funny and bratty fireplug, Savannah, didnt have a larger part. She was scarcely in the book.<br /><br />Also, the other side characters who were introduced, like Jaime and Cassandra, who was were more fleshed out than past novels grew quite interesting. Plus, i really doubt we've seen the last of Hector. He's definitely going to be the main 'baddie' of a future book...<br /><br />All in all this was a great continuation of the Otherworld series and Armstrong remains my favorite 'supernatural' author, leaps above Hamilton.	2005-05-25

While i enjoyed Bitten, and gave it 4 stars, it didnt have that special something which made me go 'wow.'<br /><br />Stolen did.<br /><br />While some parts of the book were weird, like a zillionaire with a strange video game obsession, the rest of the book was fun fun fun.<br /><br />I went through this book in a few days with its frantic and action packed movie pacing. The short chapters of Armstrong are some of my favorite for thier pacing. They arent long winded with a lot of usesless dialogue...<br /><br />And thankfully, there is a lot less of Elena/Clay getting it on.<br /><br />I didnt enjoy those animalistic parts that were heavy in Bitten so thats a good thing that there were less of them.<br /><br />Stolen is also the book which introduces her witches, which i like better than her wolves...<br /><br />Paige and Savanna are always funny to read and the butt kicking Adam and Leah are also here for the first time.<br /><br />All of those characters are extremely intresting and really get better in the later books.<br /><br />All in all, i loved this book and think Armstrong gets better with each successing novel.

This novel kept me entertained throughout and had me reading me it in huge chunks at a time.<br /><br />But it just lacked that 'something' as her witches books.<br /><br />Elena was an interesting lead, and Clay was a cool antihero, but there were a few segments that just irked me.<br /><br />The relationship with Philip bothered me from the beginning and you could tell how it was going to end before it even started.<br /><br />The way Elena treated him, and pretty much forgot about his entire existence, was just a bit too harsh.<br /><br />And the naked sleeping in the grass and the nude romps through the woods didnt do much for me...<br /><br />Still, it was a decent first book in the series, which gets better as it goes along, though it ended way too familiar without any twists.	2005-05-06

This book closes the extremely memorable Warlord Chronicles with a bang and doesnt disappoint from the first page.<br /><br />The battle on the Baddyn hill is beyond words and must be read to fully see its beauty. Lords die, legendary warriors are battling everywhere, and even one special woman joins the mix.<br /><br />I really loved Cornwells unique twists on the classic tales like the sword in the sea and Sir Gawain and the headless knight. Plus, Derfels battle with Liofa the Champion was breath taking. Liofas words to start the battle must have been scary as hell to hear!<br /><br />The Warlord Chronicles are one of the best trilogies i have ever read and are easily the greatest Arthur novels ever written. Pick these books up if you want an unforgettable, and very mature, tale of the great Arthur and his knights.	2005-04-22

Middle books of trilogies always have the difficult job of keeping you interested and entertained and holding your breath for the last great gasp in the finale. This book accomplishes that with ease.<br /><br />Derfels lineage is surprisingly given, Merlins Chauldron is found, and Arthur becames the enemy of both the Christians and the Pagans, thence becoming the Enemy of the Gods.<br /><br />Cornwell makes the medieval world come alive in these books and the battle scenes are truly breath taking. If you havent picked up the first in the series then you are sorely missing 'the best' Arthur novels ever written.	2005-04-22

This is the third book in the Noble Dead series and each book got worse in succession to me.<br /><br />I liked Chap better when he was just a 'dog' and not a lessar god in dog form. He seems like the most powerful of the bunch and his hidden agendas are getting more confusing.<br /><br />I also liked Magiere and Leesil better when they were just good friends that constantly bickered with each other. But as of right now they are way too mushy with each other and the dialogue is quite lame because of it. There is way too much 'i love you', holding hands, and sweet kisses for me.<br /><br />And some parts seemed to overly drag for my tastes. The little story in the cursed town and fight with Adyan seemed to hit a brick walled dead end. And through 400 pages all we learned was Magieres history. There seemed to be too many gaps that hint at a book 5 or 6... or 7.<br /><br />Still, i enjoyed the book in the end and really grew to like Chane and Welstiel even more. Wynn, however, is still her annoying little self...<br /><br />Ill still keep track of this series as it started off wonderfully in books 1 and 2. Though i really hope this series starts to pick up some more action and steam as each book seems to get slower and tamer.	2005-03-21

While i enjoyed Guilty Pleasures and Laughing Corpse, this book, which is the third Anita Blake adventure, is what really got me hooked onto the series.<br /><br />The book starts off as usual, with some suspects and gruesome crimes, then really gets the ball rolling in non stop action with our favorite heroine.<br /><br />The action/adventure scenes are great, the dialogue funny, and the new characters introduced are all sparked with flavor. The ending battle royale in this book is truly an awe to read and makes you crave for the next novel that much more.<br /><br />This is easily on of Hamiltons best books and is one of the top supernatural/fantasy/horror ones out there too, so do yourself a favor and pick it up.	2005-03-09

From Mafioso tough guys to horrific zombies Anita takes a few lumps in this book and gives more than a few back.<br /><br />Though the ending was a slight let down, this book is pure enjoyment.

While this book was a great first effort by Burbank, it fell flat in many areas, thus keeping it from Hendee or Hamilton status.<br /><br />Mordred was a pretty cool main character but to me he accepted his new fate quite too easily.<br /><br />He chose his new role, as the Chosen One, quite too quickly.<br /><br />It was also very convenient for him to be this new savior since he was the typical scruffy loner. How original...<br /><br />And this Vlad guy... who is he? He was never really built upon except that we know that he is trying to conquer the world in darkness. Another typical 'Lord of Darkness' as the main title proclaims him. Yawn.<br /><br />This book also seemed like it was poorly written. There were tons of short, teen level, dialogue that just did not scream 'quality.' And those drawings in the book also made the story seem like it was a bit more for younger people also. Sure the drawings were wonderful, but how many serious books actually have pictures in them?<br /><br />While my review might seem a bit harsh, i still enjoyed the book and read it in quite a short time.  My favorite part of the story was Mordered's night with the twelve virgins. All i have to say is Mordred was the man that night. heh<br /><br />So unless book two is a complete standout and smash hit, i dont think i will be buying further books in this series. As of now, it is just too 'run of the mill.'	2005-02-18

The ending to this book, as others have said before me, is extremely sad and its closing lines are truly beautiful.<br /><br />Sadly though, this book is out of print and might be tough to come by, i ordered mine through Amazon UK.<br /><br />You might also want to check out Martin's current series, A Song of Ice and Fire, which overcomes Fevre Dreams brilliance in my opinion.<br /><br />And i also heard Martin is maybe thinking of doing a follow up novel to Fevre Dream...<br /><br />We can dream cant we?	2005-02-04

When i say that this book starts slow i really mean SLOW.<br /><br />In almost 500 pages our little Fitz encounters about two 'adventures', which last a page or so, while the rest of the book is spent in his boring city without much of anything.<br /><br />Sure the book is written very well but where is the suspense or anything? The only thing that caught me as a reader were the last 50 pages or so and it still wasnt enough to make me want to buy the second book.<br /><br />Fitz, is not a likeable character to me and thats where the books dullness starts. He is WAY too emotional for a child who has barely reached puberty. I find his love for flowers, the sky, and his constant whining unrealistic for one so young.<br /><br />Plus, his love for dogs and animals sounds as if he is a 8 year old with a new puppy on Christmas morning. Please.<br /><br />Pick up the book if you can stand a well written dull 500 page fantasy about an overly emotional and annoying pre-teen. If that doesnt appeal to you then try George Martin, which you should have read by now.	2005-02-04

The second story arc of Emma Frost, covering issues 7-12, is much slower and unexciting compared to the first.<br /><br />The story is very cliched and you can guess what happens before you turn the page. Its a run of the mill love story with a twist. You can find those anywhere, and most are better written than what youll find in this book.<br /><br />The art is still wonderful though its not as good as Randy Greens in the first few issues.<br /><br />So if youre a fan of Emma than pick this up.

And how do they take the baddies out? With a boring needle in the rear end.<br /><br />Ok, this special 'dose' was interesting the first time but knocking off every bad guy with it got very lame. And how dumb are the terrorists? Two heart attacks and a third 'accidental' death in a week and they suspect nothing?

Dad must have had it hard in the CIA...<br /><br />What would dad think if he saw what i was doing? Hey Dom, you know my dad right? Just because daddy bought him his Hummer doesnt mean he has to speak of his 'greatness' in every other paragraph.<br /><br />And the way the cousins speak? What the heck? Did Tom Clancy watch MTV for 15 minutes and say 'ok, thats how young people speak in this generation.'<br /><br />Bro, barf, Ferrari's are the bomb, and 'cuz' dont really fit FBI agents and Marines MO for speaking the English language...<br /><br />And that part where one of the brothers, i can hardly tell them apart, said that his brother would rather drive a Ferrari than have Grace Kelly. I wonder how many males born in 1979-1984 think of Grace Kelly as a dream girl...<br /><br />Just another little thing that showed Clancy was out of touch with this book...<br /><br />Tom, please scrap these three pathetic excuses of characters and this worthless storyline.

They are easily my favorite books and i have read them all more times then i can count...<br />But i utterly despise The History books.<br />These books are nothing but Tolkiens first rough drafts and his scrapped ideas. He scrapped them for a reason. And i dont think that reason was so his son can milk the franchise into the stratosphere...<br />And another thing about these books is that they are definitely not for everyone. These books are only for the true diehard Tolkien fans and will NOT be enjoyed by anyone else. They are an extremely tough read with footnotes and headers galore.<br />So if you truly live, breath, and sleep Middle-earth then these books might be for you. But i would rather not line Christopher Tolkiens pockets with his late great fathers draft pages and scrapped ideas.	2004-06-29

This might not be your thing but it greatly increases the realism of the times.<br />However, what keeps the book from 5 star perfection are a few problems.<br />Some events seemed overly rushed, such as the Island of the Dead. Derfel leaves to the island in 1 page and is already off the island 8 pages later. This was probably the worst case in the book, but other such events seemed terribly paced.<br />And another thing...<br />This book could have easily been 25 pages shorter if you took out all the 'spittings' and 'spattings.' Every single character has active mucous glands and spits at least every other page. And i am being serious.<br />We get the point after a while and dont need to see 'he spat to ward off the evil' on just about every page.<br />This is still a gripping read and i really look forward to book 2 and 3. This book should definitely be picked up by fans of Arthur and should do very well in the upcoming months, considering the release of the epic movie, King Arthur, should bring it plenty of deserved attention.	2004-06-29

This short book has its moments but i feel its bad ones far out weight its good.<br />I found myself dozing off numerous times in the first 100 pages of this book, which cannot be a good sign. Plus i found that every character in the book, besides Harry, was totally forgettable. There are about 5 female characters in Harrys life and every one of them was tremendously annoying. None stood out and they all seemed to put me sleep.<br />Plus the main bag guy, did some bad things, but never really felt like he was even in the book. We dont see or hear one word from him until the extreme end and he didnt highly impress me.<br />And the demons were lame. Sure Jim Butcher tried to be unique with his demons, but 4 foot tall frog demons just dont instill fear like a 7 foot tall horned one would. Maybe im alone on that...<br />Though, i must say that that nude love potion scene with his date was very very funny. I dont think that night couldve gotten any worse if he tried.<br />This book also has a ton of wise cracks and jokes but i only found myself snickering at a rare few. The 'humor' just didnt make me laugh, and that cant be a good thing either.<br />I might sound harsh but this little novel had its enjoyable moments. If you want a standard fare wizard mystery then pick this up. It should keep you occupied for a day or two.	2004-06-26

And i found their sea voyage early on very boring and their encounter on the ship to be a worthless plot point. Nothing really materializes from it.<br />However, it does have a great new villain in Chane but the other bad guys were much more shallow then Dhampirs. Toret was a shadow of his old self and Sapphire was an annoying one dimensional character which the reader could easily recognize as fodder, who has no other purpose but to die in the book. Plus the two undead brothers might as well not have been in the book. Their personality is as thin as one of the books pages.<br />So while i enjoyed this book, not much was resolved in it, besides Chap, and the book seemed just to be a necessary stepping stone to set up the next book. But i must admit that i am curious about all of the loose ends popping up and will be eagarly awaiting some answers in the third Noble Dead book by the Hendees.	2004-06-25
US	31300317	R1LMKAVCRMGXZ1	1565040783	961513919	The Book of Nod	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Awesome little book.	This little book was made to be a resource for the Vampire Masquerade game but it can definitely be read and enjoyed by fans who have no idea what Vampire Masquerade even is.<br />This short book, which can be read in like 30-60 minutes, shows the origins of the vampires, and their sects, and shows their 'fall from grace' from heaven and why they were shunned by all.<br />And while the book might be extremely short in length, the build quality easily makes up for that. There are wonderful drawings, indexes, and footnotes litered throughout the book. And the silver lined pages, attached cloth bookmark, and smooth hardcover scream quality like no other.<br />This book is a must read for any vampire or horror fan who wants to learn a bit more on vampire history and their origin.	2004-06-19

It has absolutely zero to do with the inside and the cover blurb of 'sexy' is way misleading. You would think this is a cheesy sex romp book but it really only has 3-4 pages, out of 400+, of that material, and it goes along with the story. And whatever witch is on the cover is definitely NOT in this book.<br />On to the book...<br />I thought this novel was extremely well paced, exciting, and was a gripping read. I finished it in two sittings quite easily. And what is with people saying Paige has no backbone? Sure she doesnt have the killer instinct and she doesnt like killing, and never has. Whats wrong with that? Sounds believable to me because not everyone has zero conscience and can kill bad guys at will.<br />I loved Paige and Savanna and all of their little troubles in the book. However, i did not care much for Lucas. He seemed like the perfect guy and everything out of his mouth was flawless and the right thing to say. He sounded like a robot. I also wanted to see Adam show up, and take names, but that was not to be.<br />The main villainess, Leah, was also pretty scary and had a high intimidation factor, which starts 5 pages into the book. She seemed to be scarier the more she wasnt around because you keep thinking what she is up to next. I also dont think we have seen the last of her...<br />Over all, i greatly enjoyed this book and plan on picking up every book by Armstrong in the future. Armstrong is way above present Hamilton and the other up and comers like Harrison. Pick up the book. You wont be sorry.	2004-06-18
US	31300317	R3BR78FNZWAIZW	0060572965	661385357	Dead Witch Walking	Books	3	6	6	N	Y	Decent first book	This book was pretty enjoyable, and was a nice first try by Harrison, but it had some problems.<br />Rachel left her job to freelance but she never even has a chance to work on her own! She first has to take care of 'someone' before she can start working, and thats what this entire book is about. I guess we have to wait until book 2 or 3 to see Rachel actually start her job...<br />And the main baddie in the book is probably one of the dumbest villains i have ever seen. He falls into the movie category of dumb baddie who would rather torture, and give his victim a chance of escape, then kill outright. But i guess if he had half a brain, and killed Rachel quickly, then we wouldnt have a book, now would we? <br />And if Anita Blake is rated R and Charlaine Harris is PG then this book is PG 13. It is pretty tame with its violence and subject matter and i wish it would be a little more darker and grittier. And that leads to our next problem...<br />Some parts in the book were pretty childish, like half of Jenks jokes, and some seemed a bit more adult, like Rachel wishing her male friend would 'shift' in his seat so she can check out his package. The book goes from a steamy sexual encounter in one chapter to a childish fight in the next, which looks like it was plucked from a Disney movie. Not consistent at all and it seemed to want to cater to adults and young teens both at once, and failed.  <br />I did enjoy the book in the end and pretty much enjoyed the whole crew of Rachel, Jenks, and especially Ivy (wish she was in it more). And that mink was way too cute!<BR>But thats another thing, the book was too 'cute.' <BR>Maybe its just my taste but i would rather Rachel be a bit tougher and have a stronger stomach, like the book as a whole.	2004-06-16
US	31300317	R26APLC594MCLG	188703806X	952259818	Blood Memories	Books	3	20	26	N	Y	More like 3.5 stars	Barb Hendee said that this was her 'first novel and it shows' and well... it shows.<br />While this book handled some great, and scarcely used, things like vampire suicide and senile vampires it didnt work in other areas.<br />The main villain, Julian, was never really talked about throughout the novel and then in the last 20 pages we are given the reason why he is evil. It seemed overly rushed and i never got the feeling of 'wow, he is one mean guy.' Plus the name Julian? Come on, i have read 6 different vampire authors use that name. Find some other names for bad vampires!<br />Also, i didnt quite care for the telepathic and psychometry (huh?) humans. Vampires make it fantasy enough but all the 'special' humans made it seem sci-fi too.<br />There are also some pretty obvious and bad grammatical errors for a book of this size. And the cover and back make this book look like a comic graphic novel when it is surprisingly mature with some minor sexual scenes and graphic violence. Dont let the comic book cover and back fool you into thinking this is a childrens romp...<br />But in the end i read this book in one day and enjoyed it pretty well. It has a decent storyline and keeps you interested. And i loved that comment on vampires not using elevators, in case it gets stuck and theyre trapped until the sun rises. Very witty!<br />I also recommend Dhampir by the Hendee's as it is a wonderful read. But i must admit that Barb plucked many names and instances from Blood Memories for use in that book...	2004-06-15
US	31300317	R36S8FFAMT73OT	0765342987	615549012	Kushiel's Dart	Books	1	17	40	N	N	Way over hyped.	I picked this book up because of its huge sales and reader reviews and thought it was the next big thing after Martin. Boy was i wrong.<br />One of the main characters early in this brick sized novel is a homosexual who uses his two teenage 'prostitutes' to gather inside information for him. Plus since he is gay he has exquisite taste, is beautiful, and writes poetry. What gay guy doesnt?<br />And the main heroine, if she can be called that, is so 'cursed' that she even gains pleasure from skin seared by a hot poker and rape. Hmm, what a bunch of likeable characters.<br />And whats behind these two role model characters? A plot to overthrow the throne with political intrigue, backstabbing, and deceit. The only thing is, 700 pages in, we are given no reason at all to care for the Queen on the throne or the land she rules. Who is this Queen in danger? Why is she in danger? What is her favorite color?<br />The reader is given no reason to like the Queen and her people but we know that our main character must go on a dangerous mission to try and save her throne. Hmm.<br />Maybe the plot comes together in the later books and explains a bit more but if i dont care about the 'good guys' and the throne after 900+ pages then something is wrong. And am i the only one who thought that the Skaldi 'barbarians' were the most realistic people in the book? Those 'barbarians' seemed a lot less savage then those nympho freak nobles. <br />Its sad that a book like this, and Anita Blake and Goodkind, get huge sales because sex sells. Literature and plot take a back seat because half naked covers and kinky S&M sell. So while this book had a few things i enjoyed, like Guy and Jocelin, i cannot recommend it in the least.	2004-06-11

I read through this book pretty quickly, as it is short, and i was pretty much entertained throughout. There are no 'downtime' scenes with filler and the pace is fresh and fast.<br />I picked up this book mainly because of the series' gigantic popularity and found the cover and front/back cover blurbs way off. With a cover of a naked woman, and 'romance and steamy' words thrown on the cover you would expect this to be like that. But it couldnt be further from the truth. I wasnt looking for 'romance' in this book so i wasnt disappointed. However if you are looking for this then look elsewhere.<br />The book was interesting enough for me to pick up her next few books but from what i have read the later books turn into 'soft core porn' so i will be staying away from those.<br />If youre looking for an interesting twist on zombies, ghouls, vampires, wererats, etc then pick up this book. It will keep you occupied for a weekend.	2004-06-06

This wordy book is easily one of the best i have ever read and really allows you to see the consequences of the crime.<br />Raskolnikov, Sonya, Razumukin, and the rest are all extremely likeable and sympathetic characters. Each one has their own problems and struggles told in this beautiful book. And the work of the investigator Porfiry is wonderful to read.<br />Every literature fan should own a copy of this book.	2004-06-02

Authors need to stop trying to cash in easy bucks and leave the classics alone.<br />We dont need prequels, sequels, or 'new adventures' of Dracula and Carmilla.

I came into this book with some low expectations and boy was i suprised when it turned into one of the best books ive read all year.<br />The best part about this book was not the plotting, heroes, or setting. While those were great the villains were what stole the show.<br />The villains each had their own personality, background history and were all sympathetic characters. I really fell in love with them and the main 'villain', if he can be called that, was my favorite character in the whole book.<br />If you want something truly unique then dont look here.<br />But if you want a wonderful, enjoyable, and well paced book, with outstanding villains, then look no further.	2004-06-01

It starts off superb and doesnt let up one bit. The ending also is beautiful, smart, and tragic. Truly original.<br />And what many people arent mentioning is that I Am Legend only takes up half of this book. The second half is a compilation of Matheson's short stories and are extremely entertaining also.<br />Buy this book. Now!	2004-05-29

Its repetitive, long winded, and lacks suspense as everything is easy to figure out.<br />When the defection finally happens, after about 500 pages of talking about it, it lacks that special something. The escape and Pope scene, which are the two main points of the book, both turn out bland and not that exciting when they happen.<br />I hope Teeth of the Tiger, Clancy's last Ryanverse novel, turns out well because The Bear and now the Rabbit have been real stinkers.	2003-08-24
