He did a famous 10 year bet with Paul Ehrlich and then tried to renew it.  Ehrlich chickened out.  He wrote a definitive book on the economics of immigration that suggested that immigration is really a net plus of the nation.  In the last few years of his life he took on the gloom sayers and the prevaricators of false science with a vigor that any scholar should admire.<br /><br /> This book is really a reference.  It goes through a number of the apocalyptic whiner's best stories and with the care of a good economist debunks both their emotion and their data.  Simon was a crusader for rigor in the fields of the social sciences.  Like Ronald Coase before him, he was willing to challenge conventional beliefs and then to back his notions up with data.  If you want to be armed with lots of data and clear thinking on the environmental issues of our age - you should read this book.	2005-08-16

It was looney but like all theories of its kind - it had a grain of truth to it.  This book is not looney - except in that it purports to predict economic cycles for the next hundred or so years.<br /><br />But the book does raise some very important issues.  What is the relationship between technological cycles and growth and contraction in the economy?  How do people spend their money at various times during their lives - is there a pattern?  What happens to the US when our population begins a long trend in stabilization and decline?  How should one invest - at least in the next several years to maximize return and minimize risk?<br /><br />Dent argues that the next 5-6 years will be dandy for the stock market but after that we will move into a fairly long period of economic stagnation.  He also argues that our apparent wealth will be overtaken by the emerging economies of Asia.  Dent is a devotee of RN Elliot - a 1920s economic forecaster whose most famous current proponent is Robert Prechter.<br /><br />Dent makes a strong case for a fairly robust stock decade - through 2009 based on a convergence of demographic and technological trends.  He makes a good case for stocks over other asset classes - not all stocks but some.  He gives you some wonderful data on the economic behavior of the baby boomers - their emerging consuming propensities and how to profit from those trends.<br /><br />What he does not account for is epiphenomenality - that condition that economists sometimes call \\"who'd a thunk it?\\"  Things happen unexpectedly - and often for the better.  He also misses some trends that should worry us all - a recent OECD report decries the rapid decline in performance of American students on math and science - with that how can we maintain our technological edge that has carried us for most of the last 50 years.<br /><br />This is a good read with lots of good information - just don't take the precision for gospel - remember that economists have successfully projected 11 of the last 3 recessions.ith lots of good information - just don't take the precision for gospel - remember that economists have successfully projected 11 of the last 3 recessions.	2004-12-24

He wanted to detail the culture of California and explain what makes us different from the rest of the country to his fellow Californians as well as anyone else who had interest.  Over that volume and the subsequent ones he gave us both an interesting history and a great synthesis of what makes California different.<br /><br />This is the concluding volume of the series which brings his original vision back to the present.  That is a tough task to do - but Kevin rises to the mission.  In an unvarnished fashion he presents the contradictions of the current California - but he renews the argument that he did in the first volume that we who live here - in the most diverse of the 50 states (economically, culturally, ethnically and believe it or not even politically!) have a set of aspirations and interests that make us different.<br /><br />We rise, and fall, in different proportions to the rest of the country.  We have been best with a series of former and current perils and yet remain in a mindset that is fundamentally different.  This book presents clearly a lot of information about the highs and lows we have lived through in the last fifteen years.<br /><br />Among the volumes in this series, each has presented a mix of history and reflection - but this with the first, is the most provocative and challenging.  It is a good read - not to be rushed but to be savored!	2004-09-15

He knows basketball as well as anyone in the country and has some candid comments about how to improve the game.  But his real commitment was to the students he coached.

The Future of Ideas and Code were excellent in setting the context of the debate about intellectual property.  But this book adds to those significant contributions.<br /><br />  The author has an interesting ability to bring in anecdotes that enliven his narrative.  He also is able to relate in somewhat painful detail his intervention in the Ellred case - where the Supreme Court denied the ability of a person to publish a poem - that by any reasonable standard should be in the public domain.  He discusses the role of Jack Valenti (MPA) and the RIAA in trying to alter the balance of interests between the producers and the consumers of ideas.<br /><br />  Finally, professor Lessig makes two more sets of contributions that are important to help us understand the dynamics of an arcane issue.  First, he does a great job at setting the context for the debates about intellectual property - some of this builds on what was written in his two earlier books - but it is valuable none-the-less.  Intellectual property and physical property are not the same and should probably not be considered co-equal under the law.<br /><br />At the same time he makes a great set of suggestions about how to balance the rights of producers of ideas and consumers.<br /><br />  The original debate that got Americans concerned with these issues began between James Madison and Thomas Jefferson who argued over the appropriate scope of the \\"progress clause\\" in the Constitution.  Lessig follows in that great tradition and adds to our knowledge.	2004-09-04

Those inside believe they are under pressure as never before and underappreciated.  Those outside increasingly believe that those inside are both greedy and careless with their finances and also with quality.  Neither perception is right.  But those of us inside higher education need to rethink how we describe our finances and how we think about them.  We need to also rethink our notions about how to organize.  What Massy offers us is a set of very thoughtful suggestions about how to do all of those things.  To think about costs and quality; technology and lots of professor contact; and a number of other ideas that each person responsible for a college or university in the country could benefit from.  There is no one best way - after all colleges and universities in the US are a rich blend of types - but Massy offers ideas and models that could work in all kinds of institutions.  In the year of higher education reauthorization with cost controls and new ways to regulate - this is very timely.	2003-11-12

I understand the aphroism is really &quot;brevity is the soul of wit&quot; - but this small volume demands that the phrase be recast.  McCormick and Davenport take the 23rd Psalm apart and suggest some basic principles about leadership that come from the psalm.  The book is loaded with examples of each of the styles or main points.  But perhaps even more valuable is a series of suggestions to work with the principles established in each chapter.<br />I found the most interesting issue raised in the book one about Supply Side management.  I have been a CEO of an organization for more than a dozen years.  McCormick and Davenport suggest that the role of a leader is too often looked at from the demand side of the equation - those inevitable lists.  But leaders should also consider the supply side - what excites you about the job?  How does one find those niches which make the lists of to dos a bit less demanding.  Many leadership jobs seem to be comparable to that of Sisyphus.  But with a little attention to the supply side - those inevitable demands become less onerous.<br />Buy it, read it, use it!	2003-10-28

He looked at issues with passion but not ideology and with a keen analytical focus.  The variations among styles of lobbyists and among state legislatures is huge.  But in this book he digs in to give you a good understanding how how lobbyists affect the process - both positively and negatively.  State legislatures are a neglected topic that affect all of our lives.  They range from part-time assemblies of 60 days a year to fulltime legislatures in several states.  Some are formal; some are not.  Yet each has a group that help to move and influence the process. This short book is the best I've seen in giving you an insight of the role of lobbyists without the polemics or the smoke that most accounts of the third house engender.  While this is a scholarly text - it is still a good read.	2003-07-13

Dwight Lee and Jim Doti are first rate economists - Dwight Lee has contributed heavily to Public Choice economics and Doti is both the president of a University and the founder of the Chapman economic forecast.  But don't let the academic ties turn you off.  This ranks with Henry Hazlitt's masterpiece as a wonderful introduction to markets.	2003-07-13

Patterson seems to think that footnotes compensate for real thought.  There are almost 700 footnotes for a book that  is substantively less than 200 pages.  He seems to substitute polemic liberal nostrums for substantive debate about an important issue for our representative form of government.  If that is what passes for scholarly treatment of an issue - then scholarship has declined.<br />There are some interesting and challenging issues about why voters seemingly do not wish to participate.  A primary analysis would be to understand whether the almost compulsive registration efforts like Motor Voter - are efficacious policies.  California voters recently rejected a measure for same day registration even though the pro side out spent the anti side by several fold.<br />It would have been interesting and useful to go through the expected benefits of making registration as easily available as shopping coupons.  But this book does not do that.  It would also have been helpful to think a bit about the decline in party registrations - as participation rates have seemingly declined so have party affiliations.  What is the relationship of those two things?<br />The role of campaign consultants is also glossed over.  We have created a generation of consultants who believe driving down turnout is a good idea.  I would have liked to know more about substantive ways to control those problems.<br />The book concludes with a section of proposed reforms.  Here I rest with the Tammany Senator Conklin who had a tremendous disrespect for &quot;reformers&quot;  especially ones that relfect little about the complexity of our society at the present time.  Each of the solutions might be a good idea but there is little substantive argumentation to defend the solution.  For example, there are plenty of good arguments against the Electoral College - although there are also some very good arguments for its retention - but Patterson just trots out the one alternative without ever putting the solution in context.<br />One would hope that someone would take another bite at getting these kinds of issues on the table for a serious discussion.the one alternative without ever putting the solution in context.<br />One would hope that someone would take another bite at getting these kinds of issues on the table for a serious discussion.	2002-11-19

He set standards of excellence for institutions but equally he set standards that other presidents should follow - without personal agrandizement.<br />He argues that this book is addressed to the AAU (American Association of Universities - the 50 top research universities) members - but that is not accurate.  What he does in a concise and readable text is explain two things.  First, he explains several issues that higher education rarely is able to explain in clear terms. Yet, he does it with grace and elegance.  Second he offers a list of changes that would make higher education an even more important resource.<br />If you are interested in higher education governance or finances or the contributions of research from universities - this is a good book for you. If you want to understand the role of the faculty, again this is a good resource.<br />Steve Sample's book on Contrarian Leadership - is also excellent but focussed more on the leader.  This covers, both leaders and institutions, without flinching from the tradition of shared governance.  Compared to the post presidential books like Derek Bok's book on Affirmative Action or Jim Duderstadt's book on leadership - Rhodes book is much more useful and much more concise.	2002-10-06

This was his first book that argued that regulation in &quot;developing&quot; countries impedes economic development.  His most memorable example is one of a small entrepreneur who wants to open a hot dog stand in Peru - with six months of working with government entities - they could get a permit.  No wonder why some people choose to work in the grey economy.  DeSoto looks at a number of areas where regulation slows down the natural tendency of individuals to be entrepreneurial.  The Mystery of Capital - which is his second book - has new data and amplification of his original premise.  But this one, which has been translated into many languages and should be used as a guide.	2002-08-22

Professor Lessig takes a very complex area, how should we value intellectual property in the internet, in publishing and copyright, in bandwidth and in a number of parallel areas, and presents a clear and thoughtful discussion of the consequences of alternative approaches.<br />What will happen to the, as he calls it, information commons, if we continue on the path we have adopted in the last few years on copyright law?  What are the benefits and costs of open source and free code movements in the development of software?  What are the possible alternatives to distribute bandwidth - from radio frequencies to the internet?  Those are some of the issues presented in this book.  All of it in an informative and interesting style.<br />This is not a polemic - as some treatments of intellectual property are - but rather a strong case for the efficacy of market based solutions that will offer us both more alternatives and a vibrant set of choices.<br />The only defect I could find in the book was the need to constantly jot down notes - ideas pop out of this book.	2002-01-07

He certainly out ranked the counterparts of his day - think about his debates with Keynes or his discussions of the conceits of socialism.  Hayek had the integrity to thik carefully about a number of issues.<br />After WWII he began to think about a set of issues that would not be considered economics - but then Hayek was never bothered by the narrow comparmentalization that some academics operate in.  His address to the London Economic Club and his discussions on Economics and Knowledge (knowledge of time and place) are legendary.<br />This book is a caution to social scientists.  In the early fifties, Hayek cautioned his colleagues who were fast rushing to adopt \\"scientific\\" approaches to their disciplines - to move into that arena with caution.  Numbers tend to become real on their own and are not always helpful in explaining issues or in helping to clarify thinking.  His arguments, like the rest of his writing, are clear and well done.  The book is a bit dense for some who have not the depth of his references - but it is well worth the effort.	2002-01-06

I am not sure how I found this book - but I am glad that I did.  In about 200 pages Professor Vaidhyananathan presents a very readable history of the copyright in the US and abroad.<br />Originally added to the Constitution to encourage creativity and to improve the democratic process, the copyright has evolved into a series of complex rules that seem to work almost in the opposite direction of the original intent.<br />Have you ever wondered how Mark Twain and Groucho Marx figured into the discussion of copyright issues?  If so you can find out in this book - they both had very interesting roles.  What about the diversity of legal opinions - from Lawrence Lessig, to the Ninth Circuit, to Mr. Justice Hand - all of who grappled with the rights of the few versus the rights of the many.<br />Added to the history is an intelligent and readable discussion of the policy issues related to the copyright.  What kinds of policies will balance the creator's incentives and at the same time improve the level of public discussions?  How long should rights survive?  What elements should be included in the copyright?  What are the reasonable standards for parody?  Should there be differing standards for databases, books, movies, music and computer programs?  The risk for all of those questions is that they can evolve into hopeless discussions of legal absurdities.  In effect, that is what happened with the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.<br />But  Vaidhyananathan does not let himself get stuck in all that goo - he deals with each of those issues and more in a concise and interesting fashion.  At the same time he has the larger picture of the broader purposes of copyright.<br />You will be challenged and fascinated by this book and the issues it raises.	2001-11-29

Both the Wall Street Journal and the NY Times have panned this book - that is a shame because for what it tries to do it is very good. This is not the definitive book on the effects of technology on our lives. That tome has not been written - and probably should not be. It starts with a much more modest premise - i.e. can we begin to understand the dimensions of the change that the Internet is causing? Lewis uses several viginettes to explain his thesis - that the Internet is in a quiet phase, no less important than when tech stocks were at their high but no less pervasive. He argues that many of our traditional understandings both about sources of expertise and ways of delivering things to consumers have been fundamentally changed by the Internet. Many of the technologies that are being adopted are better understood by the young. They are less hung up by either the technology or the change in habits. What is interesting about Lewis' premise is that it is upheld if one looks at other technological revolutions. The ultimate effects may be more profound both because of the scope and the duration of the changes, but the parallels are interesting. Peter Drucker, in a 1999 Atlantic article, presented some of that historical evidence - on the disruptive effects of the Cotton Gin or the railroads and also on the speculative bubble that transformed the first phase of the revolution. Lewis offers some stories about several changes that are happening often underneath our fields of vision. In addition to the transformation of expertise and the cult of youth he develops a thought that the perception of time is an issue that all of us should grapple with. As the fundamental bases of society are made less certain our long term perceptions of what will come next (our ability to think linearly into the future) become unsettled. He presented one example, where the perception of the long future (i.e. one step beyond our planning horizon) is becoming increasingly shorter. That is an interesting paradox. The final portion of the book presents a series of issues about the ability of individuals to respond to change. He discusses a Wired article - where humans eventually become obsolete - as machines increasingly are used for more and more complex tasks. Hardly, a cheery thought. That kind of thinking is troubling but rarely on target. Regardless of the correctness of the speculation - it raises some broader issues that all of us must begin to think about. At what point should we limit the ability of people to investigate science? In all, I found this to be both enjoyable and provocative. That is a wonderful mix.nteresting paradox.

Hayek was in the tradition of von Mises, Menger and Cannan - a scholar of immense proportions - prodigious in his mastery of knowledge but quite unassuming about his ultimate knowledge. This is focussed on a particular set of issues. Its points are well stated - i.e. THE fundamental error of socialism is that any person or group of persons can understand the complexities of human interaction and thereby control it. Once conquered you might like to move on to either the Constitution of Liberty or one of his other great works. Hayek is also accessible on many places in the web.

It's simple argument was that the power of government would diminish as the ability of people to communicate across lines increased.  A simple idea that has been proven time and time again since the book was written.  Does he suggest that governments will disappear - not really.  What he does suggest is much more subtle - he talks about linkages - for example Tiajuana and San Diego - where the links between the two is more important to the area than either the link of Mexico City to Tiajuana or San Diego to Washington - trade and communications become linked more closely than regulation.  Another example - Japanese who could not buy blue jeans at a reasonable price in country discovered ways using federal express to get jeans outside the tariff.  All of those are great examples of the benefits and expansions of trade.  His conclusion - reinforced in later works and also in a number of other books on the subject (if not in practice and observation) - is that the ultimate beneficiaries of globalized trade are individuals.  See for example Future Perfect.  For a slightly different view see John Seeley Brown's recent book on the social nature of information - Brown argues that nation states will continue - which is not a direct response to Ohmae but still an interesting perspective.	2001-05-07

In this case I cannot understand the response from the first four reviewers.  This is a hodge-podge book.  Schlosser seems to convey that fast food is a grand conspiracy equal to the quality of Ida Tarbell or Upton Sinclair.<br />Indeed, he has some very interesting numbers.  Indeed, fast food has changed many things including how people eat.  But his attempts at causality are tennuous at best.  He seems oblivious to larger trends in the economy which have happened in fast food but also in other industries.<br />He talks about the uniformity of the industry - yet seems to ignore the evidence outside the country where the fast food industry has varied to meet regional tastes.<br />I am not a big fast food fan - although I will admit to a fondness for In and Out (which he mentions in an interview) but give me a break - the world is not based on conspiracies.<br />Is there good from the employment that young people get in the fast food industry?  Are the major companies responsive to consumer demand - is this industry driven by people in the industry or by consumer tastes (why in the world would each of the major chains work with menu variation if the industry drove the system)?<br />Has the industry driven out small meat producers or was Tyson already in the business and simply capitalized on the demands?  If you believe the fast food industry drove the business you should look at surveys on the average time that Americans spend on meals - and their changes in eating habits.  Look at your supermarket shelves - where some of the hottest trends are prepared foods - that is not to compete with Burger King but to respond to our changes in lifestyle.  (Swedish Economist Stephan Linder - The Poverty of the Leisure Class - was much more insightful.	2001-01-24

Throughout the next four decades Buchanan has continued to develop and explore the nature and effects of alternative voting systems.  This book is the next step in his thinking.<br />Marjority systems are accepted because they offer simplicity but they also present some significant moral hazards; log rolling, cycling of votes or issues and rent seeking by participants in the system.  In this book Buchanan and Congleton offer some ideas about how majoritarian systems can avoid some of those perils.<br />Buchanan, like Madison, has always been concerned about the problems that voting systems can create both for majorities and minorities.<br />In an era when electoral systems are being brought into question and when basic principles of the American voting process have been questioned - this book is an important contributor to the discussion of what principles should guide democratic voting systems.	2001-01-21

It systematically looks at Globalization from a number of perspectives.  While some of the conclusions are a bit outlandish - the research is sound.  If you want to understand the dynamics of the economy without a lot of economic blather - this is the book.<br />There are loads of numbers - some good down to earth examples plus a lot of excellent thinking on the implications for all of us - what does the long term nature of connectedness imply.<br />An alternative would be to look at The Invisible Continent by Kenichi Ohmae.	2000-11-22

This is not the worst book ever written on a political subject but it ranks as one of the most lapdoggy treatments of a significant part of our history.  It  may not have been written in the White House but it looks like they  approved the drafts - even with that it still raises some significant  issues about the President's behavior.  It also raises whether the  Congressional Leadership actually exercised any.<br />Much better and more  factual book is from Richard Posner.	2000-01-15

But it is also much more.  It includes a fine series of chapters explaining the history of the Acadian people (Begnaud was an  Acadian in a whistle stop) and of all the major players and of Louisiana  history.  In a short set of chapters the author gives us both the history  and the interest.  By the end I was sorry to see it finish - but I learned  a lot about both the &quot;crime of the century&quot; and also the context  of the events.  It was hard to put down - even when I came to the end.  Arceneaux did a thorough history but also took care to make it a  fascinating book.	1999-11-20

I wish there were a few less cliches. The rules are changing for internet  based providers and therefore for all economic units in society.  The  author may believe that the rules are changing more rapidly than other  observers.  I tend to think that Michael Murphy's book on technology based  stock analysis covers a lot of the same ground and in a more effective  manner.	1999-02-19

She divides the world into stasists (who include people as  diverse as Pat Buchanan and Al Gore) and dynamists.  She describes the  operating assumptions of both groups and then leads us through a series of  discussions including the necessity for games and playful thinking for  anyone who wants to think about the future.  What is great about this book  is both her clarity of style and her stunning insights.  Anyone who is  interested in either the new economy or the politics of technological  development should read this book.	1998-12-31

While there  are some things that are outdated (we could not find the CYBER CAFE in  Galway) - the recommendations were helpful and the commentary interesting.  They recommended a number of things that we would not have gone to had they  not included them.  Their city maps are a bit sparse but the level of  information is excellent and clear.	1998-09-28

Entitlements are neither attainable (we won't ever be successful in eliminating the problem we are trying to solve) nor are they capable of being financed (demands beget demands).<br />This is one of those rare books which provides plenty of food for thought across the entire political spectrum	1996-05-19
