This is probably the best homeopathic veterinary book for pet owners/guardians in the market.<br />In the first part, Dr. Hamilton explains the basics of homeopathy and how the rules apply to home caring for a sick animal. He even gives instructions on how to medicate your animal, since the administration of homeopathic remedies differs from allopathic ones.<br />The second part is a detailed and easy to follow Repertory, meaning that conditions by system are presented and remedies are suggested according to symptoms. This is followed by special conditions, such as pre surgery and after surgery care, heat-stroke etc. The section ends with a Materia Medica adapted to the animal symptoms.<br />This book has been a great resource for my cats. It does not replace the veterinary care of a trained homeopath, but it can be vital in cases of emergency. I used it at least on two occasions with my younger cats, and the both recovered in a matter of hours. One of them, my younger kitty had been ill for months, and both my homeopath and my allo vet had not been able to help him. Fed up by the failed attempts, I went through the pages of this book, until I stumbled on a remedy that seemed to fit perfectly. And it worked! My boy has been healthy ever since.<br />Now I keep it close to my bed for easy access.	2002-08-16

It will make you cry.

You'll read the story of her first encounter with an animal communicator and how this incident change her life. It took no magic wands to open the door for her.

Of all the books that deal with this subject, this is the one that finally made it clear. By dealing with each kind of communication separately, it's easy for the novice to understand what it's all about. Moreover, in each chapter you will be provided with exercises/meditations to help you do it yourself. And, believe me, you could never believe how easy it is.<br />Also, the book is filled with anecdotes and incidents from Amelia's experience. And it includes the most heart-felt prayer to Shekmet I've ever read. No matter what your faith is, this little prayer will make you weep.<br />This book has been a key to a greater world for me.

Stories of lost and hurting animals, of troubled and happy ones. What never seizes to amaze me is the capacity of those creatures to love. While their owners/guardians are troubled by guilt, the animals rarely hold bad feelings about them.<br />The greater part of the book is consumed on these stories. However, the last chapter is a &quot;How to&quot; guide, compiled of exercises and techniques of various professionals. Some are easy, some are impossible, but most of them have results. The info on many animal communicators (phone number, web site etc) are also listed there.<br />In the US there are workshops on animal communication.

Communists, Freemasons and non Catholic population will burn in Hell by a God who demands of children to inflict pain on themselves by tying strings tightly on their limbs.<br />This book has been a HUGE waste of both time and money.

Lady Agatha takes us back to Styles Court, where we first met the little Belgian man with the egg shaped head. And so, the circle is closed.<br />This is, in my opinion, the most mature of Christie's stories. Poirot faces the ultimate assassin: an individual capable of the perfect crime. He understands his methods, but also finds it impossible to intervene.

It is divided in six chapters.<br />1. The cat through history. This is probably the most detailed text I've found in feline history. It starts from the prehistoric feline ancestors and takes us to a journey through Egypt, Greece and Rome, up to the cruel Middle ages to the modern era. We can see how the once semi-divine cats of the Pharaohs fell from grace and were hunted down by thousands in the Dark Ages. There's plenty of info on cat lore and legends along with several stories of famous catlovers.<br />2. The cat's anatomy. The basics. Filled with charts that can help you have a better understanding of your cat's features, and very important or identifying different breeds and several illnesses. <br />3. Album of Cats. A collection of several breeds and their different features. Not all breeds are included here, but it provides adequate information for the average cat owner/guardian. <br />4. Your cat's physiology. How the feline body functions and information of most disorders. This text can not replace a vet in any way, but it can help you identify a possible illness and rush to your vet ASAP. It is very useful to a cat owner/guardian like myself who has found his/her cat in distress in the middle of the night and couldn't understand what was going on...<br />5. The cat and its owner. No book can ever prepare you for living with a cat. However, this book makes a decent effort to provide you with the basic information of what to expect. Information on food, grooming, hygiene, distress signs and a very detailed first aid text can help you start this enchanting adventure that's called &quot;Life with a Cat&quot;.<br />6. Understanding Cats. Yeah, right... When you think you've had your kitty all figured out, then it puts up an act to puzzle you all over again... Anyway, this last chapter puts up a good effort to map the feline behavior. It deals with territorial habits, social behavior, feline senses, and several behavioral disorders. There's also a chapter that deals with feline social life, from cats and children to toilet train your cat.<br />A final note: This is an excellent book on cats, however, if you have just started with a cat, here's a tip that few books offer: In ancient Egypt, cats were considered almost Divine. They've never forgot that, and any cat owner/guardian should always remember this. Because THEY have never forgotten...	2001-03-15

Fans of the huge cat will need no recommendations as far as the humour and stories are concerned. Moreover, the book has an excellent layout and is all coloured. A very nice touch is the little drawings at the bottom of the page that seem to move when flipping the pages quickly.<br />This book is a great read and would make a great present for kids and adults alike.	2001-02-25
US	51723633	R1Y1TSSI80BZW7	0451192257	685234959	The Revelation	Books	1	2	3	N	N	A dissapoinment.	The book starts promising. There's an Ancient Evil to be fought, and its minions are rather original. However, as you keep on reading, you come across a chapter dealing with a kitten mutilation by the Forces of Evil. Frankly, I cannot understand why most horror fiction writers believe that they should have an animal tortured in some way. Especially when, like in this book, it adds nothing to the plot. Animal lovers, just pass through these pages. You'll miss nothing of value. <br />And then, there's the ending of the book... It seems as if the author got bored or run out of ideas and just chose an easy way out.<br />This book has been a complete waste of time and money.	2001-02-23

Each remedy is well described, but if you're serious about homeopathy you'll need a competent Materia Medica. <br />Moreover, the layout of the book follows an allopathic index, meaning by dis-ease and not by symptom. It may be useful to the novice but has nothing to do with classical homeopathy. I'd suggest you get Don Hamilton's book instead.<br />Unless you have already used homeopathy on yourself, I'd advise against using this book. Explore homeopathy in depth before using these on you cat.	2001-02-10

There is no deep character development, but it really doesn't matter since most of this part is covered by the TV series. Apart from this, what we have is a good guys Vs bad guys tale, with the Ancient Egyptian Deities as evil Demons and the good Christian God as the Saviour. The Legacy is confronted by an evil conspiracy and tries to recover a lost manuscript from the bottom of the sea. There are some decent gore scenes, but that's all.<br />Fans of the TV series will like it. Horror fans will be bored.	2001-02-10

Nothing you've ever read can prepare you for the first chapter of this book. This first scene is filled with unbelievably graphic and pure horror. I was really scared and at the same time enchanted. I found myself unable to let the book down until it finished. The story is, more or less, a classic tale of an ancient evil and those who seek to destroy it and save humankind. But, in this case, the tale is coloured with many gory scenes, although none of them can match the opening chapter.<br />If you think you can't be scared, this book will prove you wrong.	2001-02-03

The author creates a dark world, where good and evil is slightly different. The creatures of the night live beside us: the werewolf, the vampire, and the bogeyman. And they are an entirely different community, with their own laws, customs and lore. And they also have their enemies, who, although human in form, hide a monstrous soul.<br />In the dark underworld of the 'Nightbreed', we follow the heroin in her search of her dead lover, who proves to be not as dead after all. Together they defend the hidden clan from their pursuers, fulfilling an old Messianic prophecy.<br />I just wish Clive Barker would write a sequel to this excellent tale.	2001-02-03

In this tale, Poirot faces a secret society formed by four criminal minds that seek to take over the world.<br />And the plot reminds a lot of a James Bond film. But Poirot has no guns or gadgets but his wits. The book has a racist touch, but then, so have many James Bond books and films. And this book was written at a time when the political situation of the world was a lot different.<br />So, what's this book worth? I personally believe it is highly entertaining. The mysterious Number Four is an intriguing character, an assassin and master of disguise. We never get to see his features, not even after he has died. As the story unfolds we face Poirot's death, his &quot;return&quot; from the dead and Hastings torn apart his loyalty to his friend and his wife. And the ending is equal to the rest of the book: Unrealistic, yes, but still fun to read.<br />I read this book almost twenty years ago and I still like it.	2001-02-03

This is a book written by someone that loves and understands cats very deeply. Some of the stories made me laugh to tears, while others made me cry. I believe that the story of the cat who was so lonely that found friends in the cellar mice is the saddest cat tale I've ever read. The book is well researched, however I disagree with some of the author's views on witchcraft. But that doesn't change the fact that every catlover is going to love this book.	2001-02-02

The layout is very good, but most of the character and quest info can be found in the game manual as well. I had hoped for more information in subjects like Cube recipes. The item charts, including unique items lists and set items attributes are useful, especially if you don't have Internet access. If you do, pass on.

What most people know of ancient Greece is the classics. But behind them, there were the everyday people, the women and the slaves, who had no means of improving their lives. No means but witchcraft. This is a collection of the spells and incantations they used. If you believe in &quot;harm none&quot;, you will find this book disturbing. This book reflects the dreams, fears and hopes of desperate people who would try anything, including the use of human corpses of animal sacrifice to get what they needed. But this book also includes some very beautiful hymns and invocation, especially the one addressed to Selene/Artemis. An important book of ancient lore.	2001-01-10

I'm a great fan of Masterton's work and this book was one I really enjoyed. In this book he creates a dark, wet small town, where ancient Evils lurk in underground lakes. The heroes battle against powerful enemies who seem to come straight from Hell (and Lovecraft's imagination) and a cat named Shelley leads the way to the final confrontation. Dark, wet, scary, with a lingering stench of rotting fish. A great horror book.	2001-01-10

Most books on the subject of Death and Afterlife fail to keep an objective point of view and are coloured by the author's religious beliefs. However, this book pleasantly surprised me. It starts with a discussion around the definition of death and then goes through all forms of Death (violent, suicide, euthanasia etc) to what lies beyond. I enjoyed that book, although I think that some people may find some photos disturbing. But, in the long run, Death was never meant to be a pleasant subject.	2001-01-09
