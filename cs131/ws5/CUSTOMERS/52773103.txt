US	52773103	R2YHIQTURH7NSB	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	1	1	N	N	surprising revelation	I had always considered John Adams as the second president of the US, between two giants. Reading this engrossing biography, I found President Adams to be one of the unsung heroes of the US. His unselfish contribution and dedication should be a role model for all current politicians.  The style of writing and usage of the diaries and letters from and to President Adams made for excellent  reading. My prior experieneces with biographies always found them to be dry and boring not here.	2001-07-11

While the book was at times tedious, I think that it helped me understand life as it is underwater for three months of the same thing every day. It gave me enourmous respect for the officers and men who spend years of their lives under the sea.	2001-06-18

NOT NOW. I thoroughly enjoyed almost every page, and within the last 100 pages could not stop reading. This is a definite must read for fans of Mr. Brown, and for any readers who enjoy this genre. This is the kind of writing that I expect from Mr. Brown, look forward to his next story.	2001-06-18

The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was that I felt that the Chinese/Taiwan issue was not resolved. But perhaps that is for another book. Other than that it was good reading and I look forward to his next book.	2001-05-30

While you want to beleve in the president, doubts are  always there. Not until the last pages do these change. As an action book it is not the greatest, but the tension in the plot keeps you right there til the end.	2001-04-23

I wonder if he is being paid by the word. I also have this same problem with Tom Clancy's more recent works. In Mr. Kings case his best works were his earlier creations. The dreamcatcher for me was  just a bad dream.	2001-04-16

But I did find myself struggling and dissapointed.	2001-03-28

While I truly enjoy books with swashbuckling heroes, somtimes they can be unbelievable. This was very believable. There was no superhero here, just a number of characters who were seemingly real and motivated by defined principles. I will read another book by  this author.	2001-03-07

I truly enjoyed every page. The author did a masterful job in merging multiple eras of the Federation. I found the the development of Captain Picard to be fascinating.

I found this to be a difficult read. I had read the prior story so was familiar with the protagonist. The time spent delving into Dr. Scarpetta's psyche was way too long. The energy spent in self analysis and paranoia was way too much for my taste.	2001-02-19

The subject matter and circumstances happen to be extremely timely. The ethical dilemma presented was fascinating.

I struggled to finish this story. While I could not predict the ending, I found the entire book very slow and at times confusing. I did empathize with the immigrant wife and son. the rest of the characters were very disturbing and dysfuntional people. What happened to the original homeowner was her fault and the city/states fault. No one elses. The concept of the story was good the substance and writing could have been much better.	2001-01-24

After the first 100 or so pages I couldn't put it down. Much better than the prior novel (Cuba). I found the principal characters generally believable. The robots seemed a bit much at first, but then anything is possible. Perhaps something similar does exist for the military. Looking forward to the next story.	2000-10-30
