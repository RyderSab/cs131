Barnum.  He was a legendary showman, curator, writer, entrepreneur--but he was also known for his humbugs.  Many of his great successes were based on scamming and frauding the American public.<br />   He was a master of marketing and advertising.  His ability to manipulate the media was a precursor for much of American life in the last 150 years.  Barnum had a genius for drawing in the crowd and creating scandals.  He was often the one who exposed his own frauds.<br />   This autobiography provides a fascinating glimpse into the man behind the legend and myth.  Barnum begins with childhood and works his way through his life up to that point.  This one is the original autobiography written in 1855.  Many of his great triumphs like General Tom Thumb and the Jenny Lind tour had already taken place.<br />   It should be remembered that Barnum is telling his own tale so it would be wise to maintain a cynical stance when reading this tale.  I often found myself nodding with agreement at what I was reading and then pausing to consider that Barnum may have been hoodwinking the reader.<br />   Overall, this is a compelling read in spite potential exaggerations.  Barnum, for better or worse, is one of the most famous of all American showman.  He set the stage for much of the entertainment world since his time.  I found myself disdainful of some of his excesses but I came away with an overall appreciation for this man.<br />   The American landscape is richer for having him.  He has provided us with one of our greatest myths.	2001-12-03

There was always something special about seeing the Dead live.  I was saddened by Jerry Garcia's untimely (but not really unexpected) demise.  <br />   Jerry Garcia was one of the seminal figures of psychedelic rock as well as an outstanding guitarist.  He was also a complex and troubled man.  Blair Jackson has managed to write a very balanced and professional biography of Garcia.  This is the best biography of Garcia that I have read.  Several others try to gloss over the drug problems and personal troubles.  Blair Jackson conveys the ambiguities of this great artist.<br />   There is a lot of insight into Garcia's personal development as a musician.  It is great to see how he assimilated different influences to establish his own musical style and identity.  One thing Jackson clearly illustrates is the incredible level of dedication and love Garcia had for the music.<br />   Jerry Garcia was an iconic figure in American music.  He had the most dedicated fan base in the country if not the world.  He was also haunted by demons that he could not overcome.  Blair Jackson has achieved a difficult task in portraying Garcia as a musical genius who was ultimately too weak to overcome his many human flaws.	2001-11-15

Anyone who goes to New York City and loves jazz will almost inevitably wind up seeing someone perform live at the Village Vanguard.  Many great artists like John Coltrane have recorded live performances there.  <br />   Gordon was the founder of this legendary club.  He found a little basement in Greenwich Village and then proceeded to make jazz history.  All the greats like Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker et al played there at one time or another.  Lenny Bruce and Woody Allen also performed comedy at the Vanguard.  <br />   Max Gordon proves to be a very competent author in this book that recounts the history of the club.  Gordon discusses the early struggles with getting liquor licenses or dealing with racial segregation.  He includes a lot of great antecdotes of his meetings with many of these legends.<br />   This book is surprisingly well written and entertaining.  This chronicle of his life will be inspiring and educational.  Max Gordon has an important story to tell.  Jazz is one of America's greatest exports.  Max Gordon played a major role in its development.  I strongly recommend this book for any fan of jazz.  (It is out of print but there are a few copies still being sold at the club itself.  If you live in or close to New York City, it would be worth the effort.)	2001-11-15

Anthologies give you a sampling of many different poets and then you decide which ones you really like.<br />   This is a method I have used to explore the wide range of world poetry out there.  It gives me a taste of many poets without having to purchase a thousand books.  Having financial limits, this is greatly beneficial.<br />   &quot;Mexican Poetry&quot; is a collection of poems translated by Samuel Beckett and edited by Octavio Paz.  These two Nobel Laureates have provided us with nearly 400 years of poetry beginning in 1521 and ending in 1910.  This comprehensive book includes 35 different poets and provides a great overview of the great poetry produced by Mexico.<br />   Paz, being a Mexican poet has great insight into the poetic history of his country.  He endeavors to include poets from the entire four century span.  He also writes a fine introduction to place proper historical perspective to the many poets included here.<br />   The collection features poets such as Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz who is an early model of a feminist heroine.  Her beautiful poems still resonate over three centuries later.  It also has works by Bernando de Balbuena, Juan Ruis de Alarcon, Alfonso Reyes and Juana de Asbaje.   This book will instill in one a sense of the breadth and range of Mexican poetry.  It is a great way to familiarize oneself with a great poetic tradition that is often overlooked.	2001-11-14

He has received less aclaim than some of the other rock poets like Jim Morrison, Lou Reed and Bob Dylan.  That is really a shame because Cohen has produced a pretty extraordinary body of work. <br />   He published his first volume of poetry in 1956.  His first album of music came out in 1967.  Stranger Music is a selection of poems and lyrics from his entire career.  It provides 400 pages of material.  One will quickly realize that Cohen has had an amazing career.  I especially like the lyrics.  &quot;The Future&quot; is a CD that seems to find its way into my player a lot.  Even though, the lyrics are on the CD sleeve, it is nice to see them in a book.  One will gain an appreciation for how poetic Cohen's lyrics are.  (The same is true for Dylan.  There is something special about great poetic lyrics getting placed in book form.) <br />   This book also contains generous samplings of his early books like &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; and &quot;Flowers For Hitler&quot;.  Cohen manages to straddle the line between emotional intensity and sheer intellectualism.  This collection will allow one to examine a great, often time underlooked career.  It is some of the best English language poetry of the 20th Century.	2001-11-10

The novel was originally titled &quot;Scnes de la vie de Bohme.  This book is Murger's tribute to Bohemians.  He chronicles the adventures of four Bohemians as they struggle to survive in 1840s Paris.  Murger seems to have created a tale based on his own adventures in Bohemia.  So there is a trace of autobiography in these pages.  Rudolph is the character most similiar to Murger.  He is joined by his friends Schaunard, Marcel and Colline.  They are all artists of one kind or another.  They form a Bohemian club which is like a support group.  Their lives and loves are well documented here.  Murger must have felt great nostalgia for his own period of Bohemianism.  It is a passionate tale that still resonates today.  If you are a fan of the opera or just interested in Bohemians and French literature, this book is a pleasing read.	2000-10-24

This is my first time reading Mukherjee's writing but it won't be the last.  I found it to be a compelling read from start to finish.  The story of how a young Indian girl becomes an American is intriguing.  The evolution of Jyoti into Jasmine into Jane is gripping.  I enjoyed the way Mukherjee wove this tale.  She includes flashbacks to her past to let the reader see the past of Jasmine.  It allows for empathy as the reader is led through the tragedies of her early life.  Her resolve is extraordinary.  She has to overcome the murder of her husband, terrorism in her homeland, a rape and many other hardships along the way.  You can see how different events shape her views and attitudes.  She begins to think and act for herself.  There is sorrow and pain on the way but it is ultimately a tale of liberation.  It's another example of the indomitable human spirit.  Definitely a book that should be widely read.	2000-10-19

Tagore uses a triangle of husband and wife and outside suitor.  Bimala, the wife is a sort of central figure as the novel largely revolves around her conflicting feelings towards both her husband Nikhil and Sandip.  She feels excited by Sandip's passion but also has a bond with her husband.  Nikhil is the reserved and dignified religious man who is not swayed by the mob mentality that was sweeping through the Bengal state.  Sandip is the passionate, xenophobic leader pushing for the immediate gain.  The narrative is written threefold.  All three characters take turns telling the story from their own point of view.  This is an interesting effect that adds dimension to the tale.  Tagore obviously feels empathy towards Nikhil but he refrains from being too judgmental toward Sandip.  Bimala becomes the most sympathetic character simply because she faces the most ambivalence in the book.  There are many blatant political overtures in this book but I find that it works well as human drama as well.  You needn't be knowledgeable about the conflicts in India to appreciate the moral dilemmas presented in this tale.  Reading this book made it easy to understand why Tagore was awarded a Nobel Prize.	2000-10-07

Cain was raised on a hippie commune in Iowa but as a college student in California feels estranged from her background.  This spurs a decision to move back to Iowa to rediscover the little girl she was.  It's a simple enough premise but it is very well written.  Her mother's bout with melanoma is the impetus for the journey. Then there is the search for a former friend thought to be dead which adds texture to the tale.  The road trip is a great American motif and Cain handles it in her own unique circumstances.  This is a tale about self-rediscovery as Cain attempts to bridge a hippie past with the current gen X values.  It is clich at times but very personal and honest.  There is a lot of universal soil in this book.  It can be appreciated by anyone who enjoys an honest account of dealing with illness and loss of innocence.	2000-10-03

It was high school when I was in my more radical, experimental phase.  Reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was a whirlwind event.  I had never encountered anything like it before.  It was a bit more than my teenage mind could handle.  HST immediately shot up the ranks of my favorite authors.  He was explosive and also more accessible than the beats.  There was always a sense of awe whenever the name of Hunter Thompson was invoked.  The blend of journalism with fiction was a unique blend.  It also seemed at times to hit on the truth more accurately than a lot of serious journalism.  But before I go off about HST, let me get back to the bio at hand.  This is not an authorized biography but I feel that it does shed some light on Thompson.  It would seem that perhaps Thompson is receiving a bit of his own medicine here.  Perry does give us some information on Thompson's childhood.  He also gets into the early years of Thompson's career before the legend of Gonzo was born.  This does help explain the development of this hick from Kentucky into a world renown icon of gonzo journalism.  I would grant that a more definitive bio of HST could be written.  There are others that I have yet to read.  I was happy to get the info this book offers.  I should tide me over until I read those books.  HST is a fascinating figure in 20th Century America.  This book is one piece to help solve the puzzle.	2000-10-02

It is a reminder that America has not fullfilled her promise to all of her children.  It would be great to read a book like this as an object lesson in the bigotry of the past.  We have made some progress but there is still much to be done.  James Weldon Johnson produced a wrenching tale.  That it is somewhat autobiographical adds to the ambivalent narration.  First the narrator feels shame in his heritage but then grows to accept himself and feel pride in who he is.  This tells a tale that America is often loathe to hear but it is important nonetheless.  The aspect of a mulatto man passing for white is sad.  One should be allowed to feel pride in multiethnicity.  This is a horrible stain on our culture that so many people had to live in denial of who they really were.  This book is a valuable document of America's dark side.  I would hope that it experiences a much deserved revival now that evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings has reopened the discussion on this sad piece of our history.  Read this book and weep but most of all read this book and learn.	2000-09-27

I am sure that many deplore the famed publisher Rossett who introduced &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover&quot; to American readers.  These are people who will probably not appreciate the importance of a book like &quot;The Olympia Reader&quot;.  Maurice Girodias was the founder of the Olympia Press.  This French publisher was responsible for the first publication of many literary icons.  Girodias followed in the footsteps of his father Jack Kahane who founded the Obelisk Press in the 30's.  Kahane, it should be noted, is famed for discovering Henry Miller.  The Olympia Press was a shoestring operation and labor of love for Girodias.  These paperbacks were put out as The Traveller's Companion series.  Girodias also faced censorship pressure in France.  Luckily for us, he was able to put so much work out in spite these problems.  He published writers like Raymond Queneau, Paline Reag and Jean Genet among others.  (It should be noted that he published the first version of Nabakov's &quot;Lolita&quot; but Nabakov refused permission for reprint in this book.)  Publishing banned English books was a grand scheme for making money.  The 'not to be sold in USA or Britain' category was a surefire way to spark sales.  American G.I.s snapped them up with a passion.  This book collects samples from this extraordinary press.  It includes excerpts from books like &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; by J.P. Donleavy, &quot;My Life and Loves&quot; by Frank Harris, &quot;The Black Book&quot; by Lawrence Durrell, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, de Sade's &quot;Justine&quot; and many more.  It is a retrospective of an amazing moment in literary history.  Girodias deserves much merit in the annals of Twentieth Century literature.  This reader merely scratches the surface but it isa good introductory volume for readers of erotica and subversive literature.  It would make a good starting point for a person interested in the stuff that doesn't get taught in schools which is truly the stuff that needs to be read.	2000-09-21

It surfaced in my  thoughts numerous times as I was reading this tale.  This book is  overwhelming.  I had always heard tales about Shackleton and this was a  most compelling read.  I found myself unable to put it down.  It just grabs  a hold of you and won't let go.  Alfred Lansing did a superb job of  storytelling here.  It is one of the most amazing tales of human courage  and endurance ever written.  This is a fabulous story.  Sir Ernest   Shackleton truly displayed extraordinary mettle in spite failing to achieve  the initial objective.  His leadership is undeniable.  He held a crew  together to endure the harshest climate on the planet.  That the entire  crew survived the venture is testament to the power of the human spirit.   The will to survive can attain soaring heights as this tale suggests.   Lansing attempts to get into the nature of the different men but he allows  their diaries to dictate the writing.  This is great because supposition by  authors of nonfiction can be fatuous.  Drawing excerpts from the diaries of  the men is a way to draw upon the incredible human drama and psychology  that must have unfolded in this venture.  The obstacles encountered by the  crew are staggering.  The wind, the dampness, the bitter cold and the long  months of darkness in the winter seem like more than any man should be able  to stand.  They slept in wet sleeping bags in sub-freezing temperature; ate  unappetizing foods; and still managed to keep their hopes alive.  These  were not accommodations up to Hyatt standards.  One wonders how many people  today would be tough enough to triumph over these hardships.  The pain,  ennui and discomfort must have been staggering.  I found myself just  shaking my head with awe at numerous passages in the book.  These are men  who went to Hell and came back alive.  That is remarkable in and of itself.   This  book is a classic account of one of man's most remarkable journeys.Read it and discover for yourself.	2000-09-19

Rock's greatest poet (w/ apologies to Jim Morrison fans, Dylan gets the  title hands down.) is always worth examination.  Some of his lyrics rank as  fine poetry.  This is probably the most important song writer of the second  half of the 20th Century.  Unfortunately, this collection is out of print  but it is worthwhile to seek out.  It contains many articles and interviews  spanning Dylan's entire career.  It includes writing by Allen Ginsberg,  Patti Smith, Leonard Cohen and Paul McCartney among others.  It is a  collection of Dylan lore by Dylan's companions and cohorts.  It features  homages paid by many who were influenced by this great bard.  Fans of Dylan  would do well to read this book.  It is very imformative and lends some  insight into the career development of Dylan.  The interviews with Ronnie  Wood, Roy Orbison and Eric Clapton are revealing.  It is amazing when you  consider the stature of the people who were influenced and touched by  Dylan.  Tributes by Johnnie Cash and Bruce Springsteen also highlight the  book.  It is a compelling look at a man ranked as one of the 100 most  important Americans of the 20th Century.	2000-09-03

His  lyrics are brilliantly subversive laid over a simple jazzy sound.  I bought  this book hoping to gain some insight into Waits the man but I found the  book to be somewhat abbreviated and abridged.  This is more like a pulpy,  fanzine type of bio that doesn't really probe the depths of this complex  musician.  It will feature small morsels of info but for the most part, it  does little to get down to the heart of the matter.  It does have moments  but it doesn't quench one's thirst for knowledge and understanding of Tom  Waits.	2000-09-03

I learned of him  through reading &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, the biography of  Jim Morrison.  That led to Rimbaud which was a huge turning point in my  life. It was when I decided to become a poet.  The Rimbaud influence  retains its lustre two decades later. One thing I always had a hard time  dealing with was his renunciation of literature.  It always seemed  inexplicable to me that someone with that kind of gift could just suddenly  turn his back on the muse.  It is a dilemma that always conflicted with my  reverence for Rimbaud's writing. This is what piqued my curiosity for this  book.  I immediately placed it on my 'to read' list.  I wondered if it  could shed some light on this startling decision.  I ordered my copy and  devoured it once it came in.  This book is an enthralling read.  It is a  fascinating tale of travel and adventure.  Rimbaud was certainly living on  the edge during these years.  His caravans through East Africa are truly  the stuff of legend.  His ventures from Aden to Harar and Dhibouti et al  are amazing.  It is interesting to learn how he mastered languages and  became like a native.  His business savvy is also intriguing.  Who would  expect the same infidel who spent a season in hell could possess such a  degree of business acumen.   I was surprised when I learned that he  developed an interest in photography during his stay in Africa.  It is a  shame that he did not get to develop his photography skill before his  illness.  It reveals that perhaps some interest in the arts still beat in  his heart.  This interest does suggest that he might have ultimately  returned to literature had he not fallen ill and died prematurely.  It is  tragic that he wasn't able to live longer. This book was an eye opener in a  lot of ways.  Charles Nicholl did an outstanding job writing this book.  I  still do not fully understand his renunciation of literature but this book  did illuminate many points on his quest for adventure and his desire to  become somebody else.  This book is a great adventure story and an  essential read for anyone who wishes to learn more about Rimbaud.	2000-08-30

I can not answer what I would do because I have never been in any  situation as horrible as that.  But this is a book that should be read by  would be philosophers and moralizers as it features Wiesenthal's heart  rending tale and follows it with essays by numerous writers of diverse  religious and cultural backgrounds.  They all must wrestle with this issue.   This is a book that should be required reading in universities if not high  schools.  It might actually provoke students to think.

He has a spiritual overtone to his writing that  appeals to that mentality.  &quot;The Journey to the East&quot; is no  exception.  It deals with an expedition that may be real or merely  psychological.  HH, the narrator joins the League and sets out on a journey  to the East.  I am not familiar with Hesse's life but I wonder if he was a  freemason or a member of some other fraternal order like that.  A lot of  the mysteries and mysticism of the League seem to evoke imagery of  freemasonry.  But this tale of initiation is a good one.  It does seem a  little wishy washy at times and some of the 'morals' of the tale do seem to  be clich.  It should be remembered, however, that this book preceded  beats, hippies, political correctness and new age.  Therefore we can not  call it trite.  It is the work of ensuing artists that is trite.  Hesse  wrote a pretty good book about a personal journey to spiritual  enlightenment.  This book should be read by people who find themselves  seeking a similar voyage.	2000-08-10

I found myself stopping to smile at her use of  language.  This is a jazz novel par excellence.  She introduces Double and  Vole through their daughter who narrates the novel.  Double is an urban  sage while Vole is a social climber worrying about moving ahead in society.   The daughter gets bused to a white school and faces the bigotry of  American society.  it follows on to The daughters own marriage.  She now is  a parent of a young child.

It goes without say that Sacher-Masoch supplied the M in S &amp; M.  This novel which mirrors a relationship in Sacher-Masochs real life is a disarmingly sensual tale.   While I have no desire to be tied up and whipped, I found myself deeply  engrossed in Severins plight into abuse and humiliation.  This philosophy  of the hammer or the anvil is interesting to me.  Obviously, Severin  prefers to be the anvil to Wandas hammer.  This confuses me as I believe in  human dignity but to each his own.  I can not agree with the hammer or  anvil theory but I suppose that it is a formula that works for many people.   It apparently was quite thrilling to Sacher-Masoch.  This is an amazingly  frank work.  It is sensual and poignant simultaneously.  Reccommended.	2000-07-22

This book was no doubt a great controversy in  her homeland of Egypt and quite possibly still is.  The autobiographical  tones are apparent which makes it an ever sadder tale.  Freedom as she  argues should exist for all--both men and women.  The way her upbringing  taught her to feel ashamed and inferior is horrible.  But it is equally  inspiring that she had the courage and fortitude to triumph over these  overwhelming odds.  Occasionally humanity does rise above the ugliness.   This is one such triumph.

In my erudite opinion I draw this verdict not unlike the lines drawn by Picasso or more probably,  Duchamp.  I may have to rent Chappaqua to make some sense of this nonsense  or it would appear a feasible alternative.  Any B.S. artist worth a grain  of sand can learn a thing or two about the fine art of deception to  convince one that this is art and it really is and it just might actually  mean something but Im sure RAW is just yanking our chain here to use a  colloquialism.  And that equates with pulling the wool over our eyes.  Its  getting us to buy that myth and bite on the manipulation--a zen masterpiece  in the Western sense.  So I can not rank it with Dostoevski or Nietzsche  but graded on a curve I would give it an A and so what if I lied--the ends  sanctify the means in 9 out of every 13 cases and I will not remind one  that RAW backwards is WAR and the assault on our senses is well designed  and intentionally taken (and delivered) with a smile.  This is some of the  best mind candy ever written by an American and if you understand or  appreciate this review, youll get a great kick out of this book.	2000-07-20

It stands as a classic both in erotica and pure (if such a thing exists) literature.  This fable follows the sexual exploits of Scholar Vesperus who learns to find wisdom  on the Carnal Prayer Mat so to speak.  He refuses to learn spiritual wisdom  through earnest prayer and hence learns his lessons the hard way. (pun not  intended)  He has his many affairs and shamelessly cheats on his wife.  He  even becomes a bigamist with a second wife in another town.  The trickery  involved is hysterical.  It is reminiscent of The DeCameron of Boccaccio in  the sneakiness of the characters.  The humor is also a fabulous trait.   Honest Quan gaining revenge is the moralistic turn.  The Golden Rule was  never so funny.  Vesperus steals Honest Quans wife so Honest Quan debauches  Vesperus wife.  Li Yu strikes a moralistic posture in telling this tale but  one can not help but feel that he had a smashing good time writing this  book.  Each chapter ends with a moral to the action.  It merely adds to the  humor.  One can not help but feel that Li Yu is yanking the readers chain.   The names for sexual positions and the numerous jokes on penis size are  exquisite.  He is having too much fun with the story.  The reader also is  having too much fun to be preoccuppied with the morals of each chapter.  Of  course, Vesperus does ultimately come to wisdom in the end.  We should be  grateful that he did learn the hard way.  It was a lot more entertaining  for us.  This book will really dispell a lot of Western prejudices that  hold the Chinese to be demure and asexual.  (Well, there are over a billion  people in China so they must know something about sex, but I wont go  there.)  I suggest this book to anyone interested in erotica and to anyone  smallminded enough to doubt the wonderful sensuality and sexuality of  classic Chinese literature.	2000-07-19

Being a fan of irony, I decided to read this novel now that it is the year 2000.  Much like 1984 by George Orwell, many of the prophecies have fallen short of the mark.  The Utopian strain of Bellamys vision is apparent but  we have not nearly evolved that much.  This book contains a lot of the  naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era.  Human nature,  alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an  enjoyable, well written novel.  Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does  not detract from the story.  Julian West is a sympathetic character in  spite his aristocratic origin.  It should also be stated that some of the  predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass.  It  was stimulating and thought provoking to read this book in the year the  story allegedly took place.  It should remind us that we have come a long  way but we still have a long way yet to go.	2000-06-23

He specializes in a kind of modernization of classic African lore.  He is surely steeped in a lot of the myth and religion of the Yoruba.  Simbi and the Satyr of the Dark  Jungle is a wonderful tale.  It begins with a wealthy Simbi growing bored  of her fairy tale (ivory tower, perhaps?) existence.  She wants to learn of  the Poverty and Punishment.  This beginning conjures thoughts of a young  Siddhartha discovering suffering.  But make no mistake, Tutuola is not just  trying to rewrite the tale of Buddha.  This is his own story.  Simbi  encounters terrible strife and suffering on her voyage.  She learns what a  terrible mistake it was to intentionally undertake to suffer.  I enjoy this  point.  One should not bring suffering onto themselves.  There is enough  real suffering in the world already.  It is a point that should be well  taken but we shall see.  I must also comment on the humor that Tutuola  peppers throughout this tale.  He is a writer with a comic flair.  This is  a fabulous fable for the twentieth as well as twenty-first centuries.	2000-06-21

It is a magnificent achievement.  Caliban becomes the hero as Cesaire advances a variety of different ideas. By changing the  perspective, A Tempest explores a lot of issues like rascism and  colonialism.  Prospero becomes the Oppressor and Caliban is the Native  wrongly robbed of his ancestral right to rule his own land.  Ariel is  reduced to something of an Uncle Tom.  To his credit, Cesaire never allows  any character in the play become completely unsympathetic.  That is a grand  feat.  It is consistent with Shakespeare who also grants humanity even to  Caliban.  I found this adaptation to be brilliant.  Cesaire follows the  theme of The Tempest all the while making it his own work.  I was even  compelled to reread The Tempest just for comparative purposes.  The reread  of The Tempest served only to heighten my appreciation for A Tempest.  This  is work that should be read by anyone interested in the theatre.	2000-06-14

He deals with Greenwich Village, San Francisco, Berkeley and any other place where the Bohemia mentality reigns supreme.  This is a grand exploration of great  artists, poets, thinkers, anarchists and dreamers.  He presents the  argument that Bohemia is ultimately a state of mind.  You may be in Paris  or Chapel Hill or Prague but you can descend into your own private Bohemia.  There is discussion of the Beats and hippies, of course, but also of Paris  in the twenties.  He discusses Israeli bohemain Haim Hefer and French  chanteur Serge Gainsbourg.  ( I obtained a longtime fondness for Gainsbourg  music from curiosity after reading this book.  There are many unheralded  madmen and women that get their fifteen minutes of fame in this book.  It  is a thrilling ride through a state of mind that ought to be more prevalent  than it is.  I felt excited to be alive after reading this book.  The  exaltation with life intensifies everytime I browse through this book.  It  goes well with ginseng tea, espresso, whiskey or beer.

This is a book that will probably be damned by the ONDCP, Dare, the Partnership for a Brainfree America and many other anti-drug groups.  They will claim that it sends the wrong message and that it might encourage drug  use.  While it is possible that it will encourage drug use in some persons,  it is a vastly informative book about various drugs.  It attempts to  tell--gasp--dare I say it--the truth.  Dr.Weil operates under the  assumption that kids and adults need to know the truth.  He does not  advocate or recommend drugs.  He merely tries to follow Joe Fridays advice.   Just the facts!  Of course, the facts and truth have always run contrary  to the War on Some Drugs so this book will come under scrutiny.  That is a  shame.  Parents would do well to read this book to learn about the  different kinds of drugs and the effects that they may yield.  College  students and other adults and teenagers should read it so they can make  educated decisions about what they do or do not put into their bodies.  I  have used this book as a reference book for quite a few years.  It has  helped me make educated decisions.

Mr  Alvin is  quite adept at putting the word down.  These poems are gritty without  losing poetic beauty.  Alvin is able to convey an extraordinary range of  emotions and experiences in these poems.  He manages to run the gamut of  his life without wallowing in wistful nostalgia.  Saccharine does not live  here anymore.  This is the real thing.  I came away from reading these  poems feeling as if I knew Alvin.  He seems like a guy that you would want  to be friends with.

One can almost visualize the young Nin being titilated by Women in Love or Lady Chatterlys Lover.  Lawrence, no doubt, inspired Ms Nin to take up the pen in the first  place.  This unprofessional study is her tribute to this great writer.  It  is highly subjective (as is most criticism written by writers on other  writers.)  Nin touches on all aspects of Lawrence writing.  She also lends  a much needed feminine voice to the analysis of Lawrence.  She seems to  intuitively respond to the characters of Lawrence. This study really hits  the spot.  It is essential reading for any student of Lawrence.  It also  lends great insight into the artistic development of Anais Nin herself.   (In some ways this book is as much about Nin as it is about Lawrence.)   This study contains some outstanding writing from an author often  undeservedly overshadowed by Henry Miller.  This book should help to cement  her own literary rank as a top notch writer.	2000-05-29

Hayy is nurtured by a roe  and has to learn to fend for himself as he grows older.  He evolves deep  spiritual ideas in spite his lack of speech or language.  Fate intervenes  and Asal happens by his island.  Asal is on a spiritual quest of his own.  He teaches Hayy language and speech and takes him back to society to  attempt to elevate the masses.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn slyly purports to be a boys book about freedom on the river.  It pretends to have no moral or motive at all.  This is not so.  Mark Twain, in spite his opening rebuke against anyone  finding a meaning in the book, is seeking to make a statement.  This is a  polemic against the evils of slavery.  I often felt that Huck Finn  parallels  Twains own youth.  Huck grows to see Jim as a man and a friend.  Twain came from a family which owned slaves but he himself came to be  vehemently opposed to slavery.  Huck Finn comes from a background where  slavery is perfectly acceptable.  The grand climax is when Huck decides he  will go to Hell rather than let his friend be sold back into slavery.  He  continues to help Jim.  This is an amazing tale although the ending is a  bit anticlimactic.  One is happy that Jim is free however.  He emerges as  the one true man and gentleman in the whole novel.  This is one of the  great underlying ironies of the novel.  It is often overlooked due to the  politically incorrect racial slurs.  The slave is the man with the greatest  dignity and integrity.  It is unfortunate that this point is missed.  Mark  Twain wrote a masterpiece.  The current controversy will eventually fade  but The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will endure as one of the great  works of American and World literature.	2000-05-01

Lifshin has to be the most widely published poet in America.  Jesus Christ Live (and in the flesh) is a thin chapbook about a presumably fictional  relationship with Jesus Christ.  The poems are solid but a word to the  religious:  They are of a somewhat blasphemous nature.  Lifshin draws up a  thematic series based on her own relationship with Jesus.  Some of the  verses could make Mary Madgelene blush.  Lifshin does not pull any strings.   If one can put aside religious prejudices this is a fine collection.  I do  not think the intent is to belittle Christianity itself but rather some of  the more self serious and hypocritical elements of pseudochristianity.  I  would reccommend this book to readers of poetry everywhere.  This is just a  thin volume but it does pack quite a wallop.  Kudos to Lyn Lifshin.	2000-04-26

I refer to it often.  Even though--as  has been noted numerous times--this is more about Miller than Rimbaud, it  remains an extraordinary work.  Miller writes at a lucid peak in this book.   I find myself turning to it again and again.  The thin volume is chockful  of Henry Miller wisdom.  A poor boy from Brooklyn providing a glorious  study of a poor boy from Charleville.  If you are interested in Miller or  Rimbaud (or preferably both) this is a fine book to read.  It will provide  great insight into two of THE true giants of subversive, apocalyptic  literature.  The Dean places the Prince on a much deserved pedestal.  This  is poetic prose at its height--a stunning masterpiece.	2000-04-26

His journey to Timbuctoo is awe inspiring.  It is a grand testament to the human spirit that he was able to overcome so many  obstacles to achieve this staggering dream.  This uneducated, unfinanced  young man attained a goal unfullfilled by many a great explorer. Galbraith  Welch does a fine job of retelling this amazing tale.  I would have to  state that I found some of her narrative condescending to the African  natives and customs that Caillie encountered in his rounds.  There is a  trace of a sneer which was probably lacking in Caillie himself.  This is a  minor criticism, however.  Welch was also a product of her own era.  It  does not diminish from a spectacular achievement.  I was inspired by this  story.  The human spirit once more displays its glory.  Obstacles can be  overcome and goals can be attained.  Overall, this is a valuable book to  read.	2000-04-22

Unlike most poets of the twentieth century, Broughton actually writes rhymed poems.  They work, too.  He has a lyrical touch missing from  most modern poetry.  He also writes free verse.  These poems are a  celebration of life.  Also being a filmmaker, Broughton is able to convey  strong visuals in his verse.  He celebrates sex and love and living life  large.  His playfullness with language is an absolute delight.  This  retrospect does an outstanding job of highlighting a long and brilliant  career.	2000-04-12

Joseph Sheridan LeFanu was an Irish writer in the 19th Century. This thin selection of short stories is a tasty little collection.  It is a forgotten art form:  the ghost story but LeFanu does  it quite well.  This is Victorian age literature with guts.  The tales are  spooky but also reveal human psychology in the way great literature should.   This is a classic of a bygone era.  I will think twice when I hear  footsteps in the attic and no one else is home.  Many themes of suspense  and terror are set down in these tales.

The Devils Motor is a short tale put out with illustrations by Arthur Severn.  It lacks the depth and intensity of The Sorrows of Satan but it is still a fine read.   Corelli exhibits less compassion for the devil in this tale than in The  Sorrows of Satan.  There is still a bit of a Faustian overture in this  tale.  Ultimately one can still save ones soul.  Corelli seemed obsessed  with salvation.  She went against the grain of much late 19th Century  literature and achieved great success.  As in The Sorrows of Satan there is  finally gradually, gently and by faint degrees, glimmers of pale gold  dividing the darkness with the wavering rise of dawn. (her words)  Indeed,  from darkness unto light.  It is a biblical theme Marie Corelli knew all  too well and a fine job she does.	2000-04-08

Neruda is the great one of Latin American poetry.  New Directions has for years provided us with quality bilingual collections of great world poets.  Plenos Poderes (Fully Empowered) is another classic.  Neruda continuously  made impassioned pleas for his people.  He was a great lover of his land  and his people.  He was a true revolutionary poet in the vein of Lorca.   This collection was published in 1962 (nine years before he was justly  awarded the Nobel Prize.)  Here Neruda states his mission in a poem like  The Poets Obligation: He will give voice to those who have no voice.  He  will speak for the downtrodden. The imagery of the sea is scintillating.  The poem Fully Empowered also backs this stand.  But amid the political  stuff there are some beautiful lyric poems as well.  To Sorrow is a  gorgeous poem.  Short pieces like It is Born reflect a deeply sensitive  poet.  This is classic Neruda.  Viva Pablo Neruda!	2000-04-04

Pure history books do not illustrate the lives of the people.  Great ballads are written in every culture to document the world that evolves around the  common man.  They also develop into tall tales which I feel is also valid  on a cultural level.  Contrary to the belief of many Americans, John Wayne  was not the first folk hero in history.  Francis James Child has collected  a group of British ballads.  These ballads give one an overview of British  life through the ages.  This is an abbreviated version of Childs  collection.  That is unfortunate since there is a wealth of great material  that was cut from the ranks.  Still ballads like Bonny Barbara Allen  and  The Unquiet Grave are glorious examples of folk poetry.  I would reccommend  this book as a beginner course.  I hope to get my hands on a copy of the  full collection.  These ballads are classic components of English language  literature.	2000-04-01

He made many trips there over the years.  Paz was also the Mexican ambassador to India.   (He resigned the position in 1968 to protest government assault on  protesters.)  There were still later sojourns to India afterwards.  Mutra  is a really strong poem.  It is a flower that grows with each subsequent  reading.  Few cities have ever been so aptly honoured.  Another of the  poems I like is The Balcony.  Wind From All Compass Points is another  standout.  The whole collection is a grand achievement.  India is the most  enduring civilization on the planet.  It is only fitting that one of the  most enduring poets of the twentieth century should write a poetic tribute.   These poems were written over a period of forty years.  The love and  passion Paz feels for Indian culture and peoples is recurrent in these  poems.  This was truly his second home.  It was the second garden so to  speak.  And from this love of India came a great gift of poetry for the  rest of the world to read and know.	2000-04-01

They are playful poems that warm the heart. It is sad that  it is such a thin volume.  Lovers of poetry and Egytalogists should find  pearls of wisdom in here.

Of course, one must understand where Cleaver was coming from.  The rascism  is easier to understand in that light.  And it should be noted that a lot  of the anger and bitterness began to wane in later years.  Cleaver seems to  have undergone a spirtual transformation similar to that of Malcom X.  This  remains an important book from the 60s.  It is critical for Americans both  black and white (and yellow, brown and red as well) to read books like this  to try to understand the horrors that have underscored this nations  evolution.  Cleaver, overcame tremendous obstacles to achieve this degree  of success.	2000-03-27

This guy is one of the original Beats.  He was part of the original seven of Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Huncke, Holmes, Cassidy and Corso.   Corso wrote an excellent collection called Gasoline which is generously  represented in this book.  This  volume also includes poems from Corsos  books for New Directions.  Poems like Bomb and Marriage are Beat classics.   Long Live Man should be retitled Long Live Corso!  Corso never attained the  level of noteriety of Ginsberg, Kerouac or Burroughs but there is work in  this collection that will really make you wonder why.  Shorter poems like  Italian Extravaganza and I Am 25 really hit the spot. (amazingly Corso can  still pull off I Am 25 at readings even as he reaches the age of 70)  This  is American poetry by an American original.  It would be great to see Corso  garner the recognizion that he has so long deserved.	2000-03-26

They seem to be the avatars of modern poetry.  Eileen Myles is another fine living poet to get the Black Sparrow treatment.  This collection combines both old poems from the 7os as  well as newer material from the 90s.  The old and new material play off of  each other very well.  She has the ability to write personally without  whining.  This is a quality often missing in poetry today.  Her life has  been an interesting one and her poetry is a startling testament to that  fact.  One poem I really enjoyed was An Attitude About Poetry.  It sums up  her attitude toward poetry and it is well stated.  Other poems like  Mysogyny and To The Maiden of Choice (to name a couple) reveal her gift for  irony and her passion for life.  This is a great collection.  I reccommend  it for anyone that wants to read new poetry that sounds a barbaric yawp.	2000-03-25

Egils Saga is a fine example of what the vikings were up to long before Chris Columbus got the urge to sail a boat across the sea.  It was a savage, violent era but still there was poetry.  This is an  intriguing paradox but I guess it shows how much the times have changed.   The saga of Egil is a compelling one.  He is both killer and poet.  He is a  savage and a family man.  I would be lying if I said I would like to have  lived through this era but it is interesting to read about nonetheless.	2000-03-25

Midnight Mass is a collection of his short stories written after 1976.  It is a great companion piece to his Collected Stories  which gathers his stories prior to 1976.  Bowles can be difficult to read  because he became so emmershed in Morroccan culture it is quite, shall we  say, foreign to Western readers.  This is not the writing of an American.   Paul Bowles became like a Morroccan in his years in Tangier.  If you want  to learn a little about Morroccan culture this is a good place to start.   Stories like The Eye and Madame and Ahmed hit the mark.  It is, overall, an  outstanding collection.  It is great for lovers of literature in general as  well as for Morroccan neophytes.	2000-03-25

I followed his career since I was in high school back in the early 80s.  He wrote a series of short stories for High Times magazine which I eagerly  devoured.  Then I moved on to his poetry.  This collection: You Get So  Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense is from 1986 when Buk was already a  bit older and more reflective.  This is around the time that his work began  to reveal a degree of tenderness to go with his raw tough edged muse.  Many  say he lost it at this point.  I disagree with that assessment.  True it  does not display the intense passion of Love Is A Dog From Hell but it is a  great work on its own merit.  Open it to any page and start reading.  This  is still vintage Hank.  Aging Buk still has more blood and guts than most  poets achieve ever.  Anyone can just scream and curse.  Bukowski obviously  achieved something greater than that.  And given how some other postal  workers turned out, we should be grateful that Buk took to firing poems  instead of bullets.  Two thumbs up!	2000-03-23

In Girls Lean Back Everywhere, de Grazia gives a good history of censorship in the United States.  James Joyce, Henry Miller, William Burroughs, Radclyffe Hall et al, have faced the blade of  the censor.  Lenny Bruce, The Swedish film I Am Curious, Robert  Mapplethorpe and 2 Live Crew are also discussed in this book.  This book  packs a lot of information about the great (and not so great) literature  and art that has been banned in the United States.  While some of the work  might be mediocre it still most be protected.  2 Live Crew may not deserve  to be mentioned in the same breath as James Joyce but one should at least  have the choice to do so.  That is one of the basic arguments of the book.   Unless a book or artwork can be shown to be utterly without socially  redeeming value, it must be protected by the First Amendment.    Some of  the court transcription of various trials are fascinating.  I came to  revere great men such as Barney Rossett and Judge William Brennan (who I  paraphrased earlier in the review) for their efforts in making free  expression just that: free.  It is a book that should be read by lovers of  literature and art.  It should be read by anyone hesitant to have their  First Amendment Rights get Borked.  America would be the richer if this  book sat on coffee tables all across the country.  It strengthened my faith  in the First Amendment and strengthened my resolve to fight for its  preservation.  A book like this should be read in colleges so kids can  learn about the Comstockian fools that occasionally muster up steam enough  to run amok over the Constitutional liberties the rest of us would like to  enjoy.	2000-03-21

I have read most of his available works.  West of Rome is a great book.  It contains two novellas.  The first one My Dog Stupid is  a glorious tale.  Fante really captures the feeling of Italian Americans in  the early part of the 20th Century.  Some may not like the ethnicity but to  me it lends a heartrending realism to the stories.  The reader will  probably feel the emotions of the characters as they tackle life problems.   (I almost feel like Bill Clinton here:  I feel your pain, man)  The story  revolves around a family with kids finally grown and setting out for life  and their parents adapting to the changes.  The dog that enters into their  life becomes a motif for the changes in their world.  It is a beautiful  tale.  The second story The Orgy is not as good but it is still classic  Fante.  This is a grossly underrated writer.	2000-03-20

Now we have a book by Larry Sloman called Reefer Madness which documents the history of marijuana in the United  States.  Larry Sloman was once editor in chief at High Times magazine so it  goes without say where he stands on the issue of the marijuana laws.  There  are points when his bias does show through a bit but overall he does mainly  stick to the facts in the history of reefer.  This is a very informative  book with a lot of facts that many Americans do not know.  I learned a lot  about the origins of a lot of laws in this country.  There are times he  speculates on what various politicians are thinking when they meet or pass  certain laws.  This I do not like because he wasnt there and cant really  know.  I think the facts on their own speak loudly enough without this  added feature.  I do respect that he humanizes Harry Anslinger and  discusses Anslingers dedication to an ailing wife and his fervent belief in  his cause.  I agree that Anslinger is responsible for one of the stupidest  and most unconstitutional laws in this countrys history but he was still  human.  I also like that Sloman brings up the racial aspect of the dope  laws which is still a major factor in the War on Some Drugs today.   The  ONDPC and DARE may not want you to read this book but it is probably closer  to the truth than most of the propoganda they are shovelling.	2000-03-20

This journal is a great opportunity to get a glimpse inside Bukowskis mind in his later years. He may have mellowed but it is still vintage Buk.  The  wine continued to flow and the typewriter continued to produce.  It does  not equal his poetry or novels but it is still beneficial reading for any  fan of Buk.  And the illustrations by R.

The tale of young Gadadhar transforming into Sri  Ramakrishna is very uplifting and inspirational. It is interesting to read  of his methods of teaching and encouraging his young disciples.  He seemed  to be an amazing, charismatic individual.  I also liked the part where  Schiffman compared Ramakrishna to St. Francis of Assissi. It illustrates  the kinship that exists between great spiritual leaders of all faiths.   Most of us seek spiritual answers and there are many paths to the same end.   This is a book that will probably stir doubt in some but could also help  promote a greater degree of understanding and compassion among different  faiths.	2000-03-16

I also am a fan of Erica Jong (who was onced facetiously tagged with the moniker of female Henry Miller) That made this book doubly alluring.  I  have always had to renconcile the raw bluntness of Miller with my own  philosophical positions.  A lot of Millers writing is extremely sexist on  the surface and even on some deeper levels.  I like the way Jong is able to  point out how supportive Miller was of female writers like Marie Corelli  and Emma Goldman and Helena Blavatsky.  (all writers I read because of  Miller)  She also cites his support of her own career.  Miller was a child  of the Teddy Roosevelt era but he sought to overcome all these obstacles.   Most of his writing was an attempt to transcend these weaknesses.  Did  Miller fear women as Jong suggests?  She certainly presents a strong  argument to that end.  This is a touching elegy to a writer that influenced  and aided Jong in her own literary ascension.  As to the criticism that  this book is really about Erica Jong, I would state that The Time of the  Assassins is really about Henry Miller and Anais Nins book on D.H. Lawrence  is largely about Anais Nin.  These are artists writing about other writers  and not critics presenting literary criticism.  It should be read as a  salute and not as objective analysis.  And I state it does succeed quite  well at that.	2000-03-14

If I joke that American women should read this before they complain it would be to ease the tension over severity with which women are treated in many of these Asian cultures.  Divakaruni has revealed a piece of her soul and raised concerns over the  mistreatment of women in Asia (as well as anywhere in the world for that  matter)  These poems are best read a couple at a time so one can absorb the  passion and the reality of the situations described.  A few of the poems in  this collection moved me close to tears.  Hopefully, a better day will  dawn.  I would like to apend my earlier comment that American women should  read this by stating that all the men need to read it, too.	2000-03-14

There is  probably some sound business acumen to be gained from these rules though  the morals leave something to be desired.  As Americans, though, we are a  capitalist society and like it or not the Ferengi way mirrors a lot of the  more negative aspects of our culture.  It is not always pretty but we  should try to learn from it.  Of course, Free advice is seldom cheap #59 so  I do not expect anyone to take my advice on learning from these rules.

(The Books of My Life sits on my headboard)   This is supposed to be a review of Ms. Corellis book.<br />This is a  sensational book.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  Readers will  come to care for the fate of one Geoffrey Tempest even though he has damned  himself through his own choice and ignorance.  There is a certain naivity  in his corruption.  Prince Rimanez leads him down the path of temptation  with great sorrow.  Casting Satan as a sympathetic character may not appeal  to Christian fundamentalists but it is a great twist.  (It has been done a  bit in Hollywood but this predates the movies.)  The devil may truly seek  redemption.  One gets the sense that Corelli has empathy even for the  devil. He is, after all, only doing what he must do.  It is his plight to  lead men into temptation.  Geoffrey Tempest is the one who has a choice.   He chooses the easy path and ultimately he pays the price.  One is  certainly glad that he does escape from Prince Rimanez grip at the end.   The angel Mavis Clare is able to save him.  He is able to redeem himself  before the final plunge.  He turns back to God and is given a second  chance.  <br />I am not going to enter into the debate over whether or not  Mavis Clare is supposed to be symbolic of Marie Corelli herself but I think  the book is clearly a shot at the critics of the time who constantly  ostracized Corelli in spite her phenomenal sales.  This book will stimulate  readers on both an emotional and spiritual level. I anxiously await reading  other books by Marie Corelli.  My literary debt to Henry Miller takes  another grand leap.	2000-03-12

But as a philosopher and writer, I always wanted to read The Confessions of St. Augustine.  The famed quote of Give me chastity and continence but not yet  is one that I have often used out of context with a wicked smile.  It was  great to read these lines within the intended framework of Augustines  writing.  This is a beautiful book.  Augustines gradual turn toward God is  glorious.  This book beautifully illustrates the human ability for  transformation and transcendence.  Along with Meister Eckhart and Thomas  Aquinas it gives one a good grasp of the early Christian and Catholic  theory.  As a cynic I must question what went wrong but my sarcasm should  not detract from the sheer beauty and power of St Augustine.  It brought me  closer to God if not back to my original faith.  Like the Bible itself,  this is a book that many Christians in general and Catholics in specific  really ought to read.	2000-03-12

Aleister Crowley is one of the great unheralded masters of the Enlgish language.  Many aspects of his spiritual and philosophical views may leave some people in the dust, however.  The mysticism can be perplexing to the  average reader.  Diary Of A Drug Fiend is successful because it is very  easy to understand.  The use of language is masterful.  It is not a pretty  story, to be sure, and many will disagree with the seemingly pro drug  message but it is a great tale.  Peter Pendragon and Unlimited Lou are  presented as both sympathetic and contemptible characters.  One feels  empahty but it is tainted by the knowledge that they have created their own  problems.  They are weak.  King Lamus almost seems to be like a zen master  who patiently guides his pupils to higher heights.  I can not say that I  agree entirely with the philosophy espoused by King Lamus but it is  exhilarating to follow this tale as it unfolds.  I am sure many will be  offended by Crowleys portrayal of King Lamus as a master who can use and  not use drugs with ease.  I do not suggest that mastery over heroin or  cocaine is easy or even possible but this is just a work of fiction.  It  should not be taken literally. I do not know if this is meant as a self  defense for Crowleys own drug use.  It is irrelevent to me.  Many great  artists were alcoholics or drug addicts.  It does not deter my admiration  for this spectacularly well written book.   Aleister Crowley could have  been one of the great novelists had he chosen to pursue that path.  This  was one of the best reads I had in years.	2000-03-09

He is one of the most enigmatic of American heroes.  All the ambiguity of Jefferson is well  documented so I will not go into that here.  I also have to state that I  have a curiosity about religion and spirituality without embracing any  denomination or sect.  This made the Jefferson Bible doubly appealing to  me.  It was an opportunity to get a glimpse of Jeffersons thoughts and  beliefs as well as seeing Jesus in a different light. I greatly appreciate  being able to read about Jesus removed from the rest of the Bible.  This  secularizing of Jesus will probably be viewed as blasphemous by some  Christians but I found it to be most rewarding.  It was great to just view  Jesus as the wonderful moral teacher that he was without having some  overbearing, self righteous religious fanatic screaming and ranting  incoherently.   This book brought me closer to Jesus simply by not having  to listen to all the negatives trappings many of his so-called followers  have tacked on to his message. This is a valuable book on both the  philosophical and historical level.  It should be read in colleges around  the country.  I gained a greater appreciation of both Jesus and Jefferson  through reading this book.	1999-10-29

Flipping through these pages proved to be a most rewarding experience.  I can not say that it will  replace Whitman and Dickinson in the classroom but it is a sweet volume of  Tibetan verse nevertheless.  I had read Warriors Path To Enlightenment and  was familiar with Trungpa through his friendship with Allen Ginsberg.  This  purchase was a whimsical choice and it has been duly rewarded.  The poems  are honest and heartfelt.  There are little pearls of zen wisdom as well as  some that bear the influence of Ginsberg and of Jack Kerouac.  A poem like  Missing The Point does anything but.  I was enthralled by poems like  Completely Intoxicated By You and I Miss You So Much. Trungpa seemed to  possess a certain purity of thought that I admire in poetry.  I would  recommend this book to poetry afficianados as well as persons with an  interest in Asian arts and culture.  It is a fine collection.	1999-10-27

As a longtime fan of Sixties psychedelic rock and Beat literature, It stood to reason that I  would find my way to Timothy Leary.  This book is an amusing collection of  lectures and tales from the High Priest of LSD.  I found Leary to be a very  humorous writer but he does take liberties with the facts.  He misquotes  the the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha, for example.  This book has to be  read with a grain of salt.  I think Leary intended it this way.  It would  be terribly insulting to ones intelligence if he didnt.  His intelligence  and humor do shine through however.  I would state that this book should  probably be only read for entertainment by those of us who have a bias  towards certain experiences that Leary espouses in his book.  A real good  read but definitely not for everyone.	1999-10-26

This novel has a wonderful title.  I would almost have to read it solely on the basis of the title.   It is not the greatest prose I ever read but it was a very engaging tale.   I have to admit that the whole time I was reading it I kept thinking to  myself I bet Bob Dylan read this book.  A lot of the names and imagery was  reminiscent of the lyrics of Dylan.  Since Patchen came first it stands to  reason that he bore an influence on Bob Dylan.  It is a very enjoyable read  for anyone that likes surrealic prose.  Patchen was always an outstanding  poet and this book more than reveals his gift for writing prose.	1999-10-25

But there is always the question of who bore influence the genius.  How  many of us want to learn about the work that shaped the mind of the genius  writer.  Well, to find out, read this book.  It will give you a great feel  for where Miller was coming from.  It touches on Millers entire reading  career.  You come away with an idea of how this literary genius came to  develop and grow.  This book is a phenomenal resource for anyone interested  in literature and occult and religious writing.  I have used this book as a  remarkable resource for my own personal literary education.  I have spent  many hours in bookstores all over America looking for titles that Mr.  Miller recommended in this book.  I discovered Jean Giono and Blaise  Cendrars and Madame Helena Blavatsky through this book.  I also learned to  put aside literary snobbism and enjoy the boy books by writers like H.  Rider Haggard and G.K. Chesterton.  Through Miller, I learned about obscure  writers like Marie Corelli and John Cowper Powys.  I read adventure books  like The Unveiling of Timbuctoo.  This book is a primer for anyone  interested in literature of the nineteenth century and early twentieth  century.  I would recommend this book for dedicated Millerites and  literary-minded persons of all persuasions.  Miller gave the world a  wonderful gift in this book.  If you are interested in literature then buy  this book and begin the search for yourself.	1999-10-24

So it stands to reason that my opinions towards Hunter  may be a bit coloured and clouded. (Pun possibly intended.)  But this is a  wonderful collection of lyrics.  Hunter is a true poet whose song lyrics  deserve to live and breathe in printed form.  I always felt there was a  poetry to rock lyrics: Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Jim Morrison, Richard Hell et  al.  Robert Hunter also deserves to be recognized on that list of Rock Poet  Laureates.  Beautiful lyrics like Box Of Rain and Ripple take on a new life  when read from the page.  It gives one the chance to see how good the use  of language actually was. Terrapin is a tour de force epic of Rock poetry  and almost everything from American Beauty and Workingmans Dead ring out as  great poetry.  While there is some average, weaker material as well, this  gives Hunter a chance to earn acknowledgment for the fine poet that he is.   The Grateful Dead would never have achieved their legendary status without  the mystical, magical lyric ability of Robert Hunter.  This book is a  treasure trove that deserves a place next to the Dylan lyric book from  62-85 and the collection of lyrics put out by Lou Reed as well.	1999-10-23

As a Henry Miller devotee, I try to seek out and read the books of his life.  Some of them even become books of my life.  I found The Great  Secret to be a pretty interesting book.  I have an ongoing interest in  human spirituality and religion.  There is a great deal of information in  this book which must have been startling in 1922 but has less impact in  1999.  It did provide me with some data on the earliest origin of the Hindu  faith as well as facts on Egyptian mythology and others.  I can not really  say I buy it all hook, line and sinker but books of this nature do  stimulate a lot of serious thought.  It is easy to see why the cosmogonical  eye of Henry Miller was so impressed.  It did rouse a lot of philosophical  musing in my mind as I waded through each chapter.	1999-10-22

At that age, it paled in comparison to the horror flicks of the day.  All the psychological factors did not register  at that time. I did decide to re-read the book more recently. I also  re-read it right on the heels of reading The Double by Fyodor Dostoevsky  and Edgar Allan Poes short story William Wilson.  I would have to rank it  lower than the story by Old Fyodor but it still had a stronger impact than  it did as a pubescent punk kid.  It is also a bit more developed than the  Poe tale.  My interest in the dual nature of man has been piqued by reading  these two books.  The motifs of the story were more apparent.  It is a  great work that gets overlooked by the literati but will surely outlive  many of the preferred classics that the Academy recommends. I would say  that anyone interested in psychology in literature or in the dual nature of  man should give this a try.   Rediscovering these old literary classics has  proven to be a great joy and a very rewarding experience.  Recommended.	1999-10-21

I, along with many of my friends, became curious about investigating this exciting new angle to  drinking beer. We all learned that there is more to drinking beer than just  foolishly slurping Budweiser.  One of the best sources for learning about  beer styles and great beers brewed around the world is reading the books of  Michael Jackson, British writer not American singer.  Luckily, he removes  one glove long enough to write these books.  If you want to learn about  beer, this is a very good resource.  In my travels around America and the  world, I seek out beers he recommends.  This book is a primer on the many  splenid styles of beer.  There is a difference between an India Pale Ale  and a Czech pilsner.  He will point out several classic examples of each  style he documents.  I learned about the traditions of the countries that  have great brewing histories.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore and  Michael Jackson is one of the leaders in spreading the good word.  His  poetic prose and vast knowledge of the subject make for a fascinating read.   Even a non-believer might learn a thing or two from this book.  From Abbey  doubles to Extra Special Bitters to Berliner weissebiers, this book has it  all.	1999-10-21

The three tributes to the late Bob Kaufman are fitting elegies to one of Americas most overlooked poets.  (Although A.D. himself is also on that list of  neglected poets.)  A.D. is one of those poets that really gets down to the  nitty gritty of the matter.  He is a poet of the soil as opposed to a lot  of poets who are floating on clouds of delusion and never actually saying  anything.  This collection, which is a tribute to his home city of San  Francisco, is a tasty collection that stirs a desire to make another trip  out to Frisco.  The poems about North Beach and the Mission bring those  areas to life.  He has lived a lot of life on these streets and it comes  out in his verse.  A great poet poeticizing a great city.  Highly   Recommended for fans of honest and gutsy poetry.	1999-10-20

This is untrue.  The horror and evil of slavery is something that every American should confront.  This is not to hang or condemn anyone.   Its just to say that a book like The Narrative of Sojourner Truth is  something that everyone should read.  I was at times stunned by Sojourner  Truths startling courage in the face of the evil she faced.  It was also  enlightening to read about the slavery of the Northern states like New York  and that so many people in that region still spoke Dutch even well into the  19th Century.  I was infuriated reading about the treatment of the slaves  but I also was inspired by Sojourner Truths dignity and strength.  Much  like the Nazi holocaust, slavery is a horror that must never be allowed to  happen again.  If everyone read books like this, we would be one step  closer to making that a reality.	1999-10-19

The oppression of anyone is an evil that must be overcome.  Frederick Douglass displayed a remarkable courage in learning to read and write to  finally overcome the horror of slavery.  I appreciate his observation on  the religious hypocrisy of the South.  It was telling that religious slave  owners were always the worst.  Of course since religion helped breed  slavery in America this really should not come as any surprise.  I have  great admiration for the founders of this country but I also feel that the  evil and hypocrisy of slavery should be exposed.  It is an ugly passage in  American history that must be addressed.  This book should be read by high  school kids in every high school in America--make that every American  period. Frederick Douglass deserves to be recognized as a great American  and this book is essential reading for any American.	1999-10-19

There was such a fervor and passion for freedom from the iron fist of the British Empire that a foundation for  freedom was established that many nations worldwide would come to imitate.  I have to admit that when I read a brief manifesto like Common Sense by  Thomas Paine, I imagine what it would have been like to have been a  colonist in those days.  Would I have had the courage to join the  Revolution?  Thomas Paine was a bit of a rogue but surely he inspired quite  a few people to take up arms in the Revolution.  And he did grant us the  time honoured notion that at its best, government is merely a necessary  evil.	1999-10-19

I remember the first time I saw a Carlin HBO special when I was a mere lad of 12. I remember hours spent trying to memorize routines from his albums like Class  Clown and Occupation: Foole.  When all the other comedians took the easy  out and became tv stars and movie actors, Carlin stayed the course of stand  up and emerged as one of, if not, the all time best stand up comic.  Brain  Droppings is a true delight because the written word gives one a new  appreciation for Carlins mastery of the English language.  He could have  been a poet or a great fiction writer. I would rank Carlin as one of the  great satirist in American history in addition to being a great stand up  comic.  Mark Twain surely would grant an approving nod at this collection.   It offers a wide range of material both old and new.  It also restates his  influence on my own writing.  Carlin will never be in my list of people I  could do without.	1999-10-19

There is much  in this book  which goes unexplained which I feel lends to the overall feel  of the book.  After all, how much of neurosis and psychosis is following  normal reason?  One does come to feel a certain pity for one Yakov  Petrovitch Golyadkin.  One certainly doesnt want him to be committed.  (the  apparent but unknown conclusion.)  It creates a creepiness and eeriness  that makes most modern horror flicks seem amateurish and groping.	1999-10-18
