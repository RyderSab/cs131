I'm not overly fond of <br />romances but I do enjoy rodeos so, for a quarter, I felt like I had nothing to lose.  However what I <br />gained from reading Jo-Ann Mapson's Blue Rodeo was much more than a contemporary <br />romance; I found a deeply written novel of art, spirit, truth, change, and yes, love. <br />     Margaret Yearwood thinks she has reached the bottom.  Her marriage to Ray Sweetwater <br />has crumbled.  Her son Peter has been left deaf after nearly dying from a bout with meningitis due <br />to a truant outing.  When Peter decides that he wants to immerse himself in the deaf culture, the <br />only way to do so is by living in a boarding school and residing with a foster couple who are also <br />deaf.  Only problem is that they live in California and this facility is in New Mexico. <br />     Peter's defiance and need to cut the apron strings tears at Margaret's heart.  This tears <br />Margaret to the quick as she had given up grad school to have a home and a family.  To abide by <br />the residency requirements, Margaret gives up a life of luxury and comfort, which includes a <br />waterfront home and a sailboat, to try and put down roots in Blue Dog.  Since she'll do just about <br />anything to be part of her son's life, she rents an old farmhouse.  Her nearest neighbor is a fifty- <br />two sheep rancher, Owen Garrett, with a past he's running from and secret that haunts his every <br />fiber. <br />     There in the desert, the art and creative nature that Margaret has so long tried to deny.  <br />\\"But what came to her now as she lay in bed was another shock, strangely related.  For years, she <br />had shunted aside brief, awkward glimpses, peter's going deaf had provided her with an <br />understanding of the reason she abandoned art when she married Raymond.  It wasn't about Ray's <br />insistence that she stay home and devote herself to having his babies, a decisionshe'd ultimately <br />embraced as sensible and desirable.  When Peter went away she could no couch her excuses under <br />the heading of motherhood.  Art took time away from other things, certainly, but creativity was a <br />state of mind you fertilized and tended, not something you made room for.\\" <br />     So she started painting again, learning the true value of the heart's inner passion as well as <br />the physical passion that Own re-ignited in the love-staved woman.  First, with both the art and <br />Owen, her strokes are safe.  But soon she learns that as she delves into the sunshine, so must she <br />step into the heart's darkness to really love and create. <br />     I found Blue Rodeo spoke to my creative soul much more than my romantic one. Unlike <br />most romance novels, Blue Rodeo has a surprise ending that left me feeling hopeful. <br />      <br />	2005-07-04

The Promise <br />Festival is in high gear, celebrating the bygone glory days of Curston.  A new statue is about to <br />be dedicated in the Main Square.  It's in the artists likeness, a former watcher, only she has been <br />missing for two weeks.   Kellach and Driskoll hare having a lot of fun when their good friend, <br />Moyra, asks the boys to help her escort her soon-to-be-released-from-prison father back home.   <br /> <br />Not that she needs their help.  She doesn't.  Moyra is quite a capable little gal.  But she did <br />promise her mother that she wouldn't go alone.  Many of the watchers and villagers were <br />disappearing and there are far too many for it to be a coincidence.  But when they arrive at the <br />prison, Moyra's father, Braddo, is acting funny. <br /> <br />And now that they've noticed it, many of the watchers are acting rather strange too.  Like <br />something has altered their brains and making them do things they normally wouldn't.  They go <br />to Zendric, the great wizard, with their concern.  But he has a visitor whom the little trio doesn't <br />recognize, and Zendric refuses to identify the mystery guest.    Kellach doesn't like secrets and <br />starts a mission to discover the identity of the stranger.  <br /> <br />The inn were they think that the visitor is lodging only for it fo be consumed by fire.  They spot <br />three men chasing a hooded figure.  Sure that the fleeing form is Zendric's guest, the three begin <br />to follow, only to wind up being chased through the streets and into a warehouse.  This begins a <br />tale.  To solve the mystery of the watchers weirdness and to identify the stranger at Zendric's, the <br />little band must first detect and decipher a riddle that begins on the edges of the newly dedicated statue.   <br /> <br />This second book is as much fun as the first.  However, Soesbee's <br />rendition of the characters makes them appear much less mature than first author Matt Forbeck <br />described.  It was also a tad disconcerting when the three used twenty-first century language (like <br />\\"totally\\" and \\"weird\\") in an era that is definitely not modern.	2005-06-25

Separate authors write the books, and it will be interesting to see how the characters vary. <br /> <br />The first tale, Secret of the Spiritkeeper, is set in the village of Curston.  Fourteen-year-old <br />Kellach is studying under the great wizard Zendric.  He's not a bad apprentice, but lacks <br />confidence and the attention span needed.   Also, Kellach is still so new to the world of wizardy <br />that he only knows a few baby spells, nothing that could get him into any trouble. Well, not <br />much anyway. <br /> <br />Kellach and his 12-year-old brother Driskoll are on their way home when they meet their good <br />friend Moyra.  A band of half-orc is chasing Moyra.  Kellach performs a little magic and <br />distracts the lead half-orc, Kruncher.  Luckily for all three of them, they are out past curfew (a <br />time when not a soul travel the Curston street if they want to see daylight) and wind up in front <br />of Curston's magistrate, Lexos, who lets them off with a warning. <br /> <br />On the way to school the next morning, Kellach and Driskoll discover the body of the great <br />wizard Zendric.  His body is there, but the Kellach notices that the globe he has been warned <br />against has disappeared.  And inside the globe is Zendric's spirit.  Kellach knows that if he, they, <br />can find the globe in time that they can return Zendric's soul and thereby restore Curston's most- <br />respected wizard. <br /> <br />What follows is the adventure the threesome has as they begin their search. Like their heroes, the <br />Knights of the Silver Dragon (an order long decimated during the Sundering of the Seal) the <br />little band they overcome many obstacles, acting brave when they much rather be at home <br />studying in front of the fire. Along the way they travel outside the city into the ruins of the old <br />city that meet with fortune hunters, enter the old city and climbinto the Dungeons of Doom <br />where they meet such creatures as an owlbear, goblins and the goblin-king and zombies.   <br /> <br />It's a rip-roaring tale that is sure to delight anyone who reads it. Secret of the Spiritkeeper <br />reminded me a little of Harry Potter.  And although I'm probably the only person on the planet <br />who doesn't like Harry, I did get a kick out of Kellach, Driskoll, and Moyra.  They were more <br />human and seemed more age appropriate.  <br /> <br />Secret of the Spiritkeeper is a self-contained novel that doesn't require a commitment to the other <br />three novels in the series to enjoy this one.  In fact, that's probably the biggest drawback of this <br />book.  There's no need to read further.  On the other hand, it will be interesting to see if the little <br />band can reconstruct a real Knight of the Silver Dragon origination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-25

However, I was truly disappointed.  The characters are one-dimensional and could not evoke any empathy from me whatsoever. I felt as if they were bad caricatures from what is protrayed in the movies as Southern women. The quotes from historical documents that begin each chapter are unrelated to the events in the chapter and serve no purpose unless it is to document Jiles' research.  The time frame skipped around, especially if you tried to connect the historical quotes and the chapter itself.  In addition, the uncoventional punctuation made this already difficult read virtually impossible.  I gave up after 100 pages.	2005-05-31

However, in <br /> Leonce Gaiter's debut novel of the same name, that infamous stretch of asphalt is merely <br />window dressing for the true face of New Orleans to hide behind. <br /> It's Mardi Gras, 1958.  Deke Wately steps from a Greyhound Bus into the wild <br /> and wicked carnival atmosphere.  \\"Frenzy reigned on Bourbon Street. Barrel fires <br />burned, and the bodies cavorting around them seemed as rapt as lewd priests at dead <br />men's pyres.  Deke couldn't take three steps without some drunk man or woman <br />slamming into him.  He was the only one on the street not ricocheting wildly with a <br />rapacious smirk on his face or his private lusts smeared, draped, painted and sequined all <br />over his body.  Men and women screamed at the noise.\\" <br />  Deke, a second-rate gambler and nomad,  is uncomfortable in the masked city. <br />But he's been invited to play in wealthy gangster August Moreau's personal game; the <br />stakes are too high.  As he enters the private L'hotel Moreau, he first meets the deformed <br />Ray, who hides behind a mask; then Jimmy, the well-tailored, gun-toting bellman;, then <br />Deke comes face to face with the book's real protagonist Alex, Moreau's mulatto son <br />whose desire to revenge his mother's death drives him to the very edge of insanity.   <br /> <br /> <br /> Alex shuffles the other players while he thrusts Deke at his father's mistress, the blonde bombshell, Hannah, as part of his revenge.  Hannah.  The girl Deke bedded and the woman he abandoned. Now that he's seen her again,  \\"he wanted to savor that moment when they first caught of each other.  She was his past, the bridge between who he was and who he was becoming.  She was that piss-poor Texas town.  She was his irreclaimable youth, his resting place.\\" He heard she'd  killed a man so Deke had more to worry about than an angry female.  The narrative weaves between the debauchery of Bourbon Street, the Ten Spot Bar where Deke is sent to face more than Hannah's long-held wrath, and the L'hotel Moreau, where umpteen hidden agendas are waiting to be dealt and played.  After a savage beating at the Ten Spot, Deke stumbles through the writhing crowd and back to the hotel.  \\"He felt safe once he put his hand on the gate of the L'hotel Moreau.  He didn't have the presence of mind to note the irony.  What at first seemed foreign and frightening to him now had been supplanted by horrors far worse, that it had become a comfort.\\" Deke watches in dismay as he learns that the game he came to play is more than cards and the hand he holds isn't a winner.   <br /> Chapter One has too many similes for my taste but after that the narrative smooths out. The story is dense, much in the Faulknarian style  with an intricate use of language, themes of racism, and clashing between the Old and New South.  Yet the soul-stirring beat of jazz pulsates behind the words, forcing the pages apart.     <br /> <br /> The true story of Bourbon Street lies in its shadows; the places Deke can't really see and the images Alex can't forget.  Gaiter's Bourbon Street is best for what it isn't than what it is.  The plot, although intricate, is rather predictable and the ending is rather cheesy, but that voice. Oh that voice trumpets loud and long of a new talent surfacing in the literary world.  <br />	2005-05-28

No matter how exciting, busy, and fulfilled our lives are, not every day is a day to be recorded for posterity.  Some days the most exciting thing that happens to me is that I get out bed. For those of us who like to record our daily adventures or just like to take a moment to regroup, journaling is one of the best ways to keep it all together.  Not since scrapbooking replaced journaling as America's favorite activity has there been a better how-to guide on journaling. The Journal Wheel Guide Book is a handy-dandy little guide (50 pages) that is a useful tool for both the beginning journal writer and the old pro who wants to liven up his/her normal entries. <br />The Guide Book is broken into two sections. First there is the &quot;wheel.&quot;  Writers match the month and date along with his/her mood to get a technique number.  The 13 techniques give the writer a particular style to establish their style.  For example, today's month and date, along with an apathetic mood, matched technique number 11 &quot;unsent letters.&quot;  The writer writes a letter that may be express anger, unrequited love, or any other myriad of feelings, but is never sent because it stays neatly on the pages of the journal.  <br />The second section of The Journal Wheel Guide Book, Thirty-One Topics, is designed to use the techniques with prompts or suggestions---ideas to help you get the words on paper.  I've found that the Thirty-One Topics is an excellent source for me to sharpen my fiction writing skills, especially if I'm not having a &quot;good&quot; writing day.  I can take a character or a situation, add one of the topics---chosen strictly by closing my eyes and pointing--and move into uncharted territory or bring them/it more clearly into focus.<br />The Journal Wheel Guide Book is a wonderful asset to a writer's library.	2003-05-14

US	50106175	R3KIEDSLAL17FN	0385333757	64473411	Losing Julia	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Stunning!	Jonathan Hull's beautifully crafted novel about love and war is  superb.  The story is told through Patrick Delany's eyes as a 19-year-old foot soldier in the trenches of WWI, as a 29-year-old WWI veteran looking for answers to the never-ending questions of life, and as an 81-year-old great-grandfather in a nursing home.  Hull does a wonderful job weaving the narrative through the different phases of Patrick's life; he understands and knows the characters of Patrick, Daniel, and Julia the way any writer should---like he/she knows himself/herself.  There are no surprises or unusual twists...the reader knows that Daniel dies, but the manner of his death is still shocking. I literally gasped and had to close the book to adjust to the vivid scene that Hull described. In our quest to honor the veterans of WWII, I think Americans may have forgotten the greater horrors (if possible) of WWI.  And it comes as no surprise that Patrick loses Julia, Daniel's lover.  But the manner in which the characters get from Point A to Point B and the choices each character makes makes this is one of the best crafted novels to be published in the last five years.  It takes a lot of skill to interweave such three timeframes so that the reader is neither lost nor bored. It would have been easy for Hull to descend into the ghastly and ubiquous, but his ability to tell the tale rises well above the ordinary.  I plan to use this novel in my Basic Fiction Writing classes as illustrations of the amount and type of descrption, character development  and plotting.  There is not an unnecessary word or scene in this entire novel.  It's a page-turner that will live in my heart for many, many years.	2003-01-18

The third installment of Living Voices of the Past is another wonderful history lesson!<br />Hilda Faunce leaves her comfortable Seattle, Washington, home to journey to the Southwest and the Navajo reservation with her husband in 1914.  While one may think that everybody had cars back then, the Faunce's made their way in the manner of the original pioneers: by wagon.<br />Hilda's journey is not so much a journal of her trip as it is her life on the reservation between 1914 and 1918.  Hilda's writings are indeed an historical eye-opener.<br />First, there is the problem with the language; then the protocol; and the normal daily variances of two races trying to live side-by-side.  Cultural diversity may be a late-twentieth-century term, but the fact is that many in America were already experiencing this phenomenon. <br />The entire journal is mesmerizing; Hilda uses very descriptive language to convey the sights and sounds of the unusual customs and landscapes that she encounters that transfers the listener to reservation life during the second decade of the twentieth century.<br />Two aspects were particularly telling of a different culture: contending with a white-man initiated illness and the onset of World War I.  <br />The Navajo's were forced to face and contend with small pox, a deadly disease they had never known until the white man arrived.  Many of Hilda's new friends died, devastating the young woman.<br />Newspapers were a rarity and treat on the reservation, so Hilda did not know much of what was going on outside her and her husband's little trading post. While the world was trying to blow itself to smithereens, the Faunce's and the Indians were trying to make a living by mainly trading...especially furs and foods.<br />Desert Wife is an important historical document that from which we can all learn tolerance and the need to just get along!	2002-08-21

Thomas Parmalee's collection of short stories, Full Moon Shining, takes readers to the dark side of the mind.  In the ten pieces, Parmalee explores the vulgar (not pornographic, but ugly) and moody aspects of mental illness.  While sometimes, hard to follow, the stories reflect a reality that many people must endure on a daily basis.  <br />I enjoyed the title story, \\"Full Moon Shining,\\" where an mentally institutionalized man traverses the realm of sanity and insanity on a second-by-second basis.  My favorite story, however, is \\"A Train of Thought.\\"  In this tale, nothing is as it was just seconds earlier, people seem to age drastically within the course of one minute.  It is wonderfully metaphorically piece on the passage of time.<br />Parmalee has a wonderful new talent. He does use a beginner/cheap trick in the last story, \\"Men Without Undershirts,\\" but that can be forgiven.  What I can't forgive is the lack of proper editing.   I would normally give this collection a five-star rating, but as it published through a vanity press, it is full of editing errors that should have been caught.	2002-07-13

It (romance) won't work two jobs to put the kids in private school, and it sure as hell won't go out into the rain or snow to buy chicken soup and aspirin when you get the flu.\\"  <br />\\"Check Him Out\\" also gives practical, sound advice on how women should pay attention to a man's friends, how to evaluate his relationships with his family and how his family interacts with each other, his religious beliefs (nothing can kill a marriage faster, says Wilson), previous marriages and relationships with other offspring, and how he handles money.<br />This is a wonderful book, geared toward women of every race and color, with pragmatic recommendations to help the 21st-century woman explore and find the love of a lifetime.	2002-06-28

The tales of her life begin with her marriage to Jack Summerhayes in 1874.  She follows him to the Wyoming Territory and Fort Russell where she learns that Army wives don't have nurse, cooks, and maids.  She is totally on her own and makes due with what she can.  She learns to put up with sand storms, scorpions, wild coyotes stealing their food, Indians, Mexicans, and the Army protocol.<br />Mattie is a woman who is not used to hardship, but as the memoir is told from the early 20th century, the hardships and reality checks she faces do not seem so difficult as they must have been when she was enduring them.  <br />Mattie follows Jack to more than ten posts during his 30-year career.  Along the way she has two children, Harry and Katherine, but Mattie seems more concerned with her own comfort and illnesses along the way than she does about her babies.  Most of the time she refers to Harry as her son, and it is a good hour and a half before listeners learn his name. <br />Jane Merrifield-Beecher is the voice of Mattie.  She reads Mattie's memories so fast, that they are often difficult to decipher.  Mattie's memories are rather superficial and while listeners learn about life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the adventure is more like a bad &quot;B&quot; movie than a real-life account of an Army wife.	2002-06-16

Kathryn Lively chooses to tackle probably the most controversial topic of our time, abortion, for her debut novel. That not only takes guts, but a deep insight to her characters and the dilemmas they encounter.<br />First let me warn readers that the first 50 pages is whether confusing.  Lively introduces a myriad of characters and while they are delineated very well, the sheer number can be overwhelming.  Essentially the novel boils down to three main characters: Barbara Fitzgerald, otherwise known as Rosie for her crafting handmade rosaries; Monica Merwin, a high school girl who thinks she is pregnant; and Pre Winningham, who harbors a deep secret that deters her from any intimate relationship.<br />The manner in which Lively puts all these characters into motion, interacting with each and the events in which they find themselves is characteristic of an up-and-coming novelist.  The book starts off with a bang, literally and figuratively.  <br />Lively also does an excellent job in explaining the Catholic faith.  To a Catholic, the descriptions might seem redundant, but each scene is pushed forward by relating to the non-Catholic readers.<br />There is an interesting twist to the novel that I never saw coming and, to be honest, it shocked me, but it pulls the novel together and makes readers think.  Lively has drawn a basic set of characters that readers will want to follow no matter what <BR>situation.<br />Add to the mix that Lively never gets preachy with the characters point of view and you'll find a great read.	2002-06-12

Frink (Living Voices of the Past)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A Must Hear Tale From the Trail!	As Americans we have heard many tales, true and false, of tales of, and about, those brave souls who migrated across the country in wagons and on foot in the 19th century.  Beverly's LTD has recorded The personal diary of one such woman, Margaret A. Frink.<br />Mrs. Frink, along with her husband, whose first name we never know, and a boy named Robert leave their nice home in Martinsburg, Indiana, for the riches of the California territories.  It's not only the promise of gold that spurs this couple on, but of the riches available to those who make the arduous trip.<br />Mrs. Frink keeps a detailed diary of the daily distances traveled (how did they m ark this?), the price of provisions along the way, the weather, the many people they run into, and an acute observation of the fashions on the trail.  I found that quite interesting, those detailed descriptions of fashion, in clothing, transportation, and supplies, and the daily traveling distance.  I also found myself amazed at the mileage the wagons were able to make each day and the price of provisions along the way.  In 1851, one onion costs the Frink's one dollar, which is astronomically even in the 2002 market.<br />Susan Baxter, an actress at the Creede Repertory Theatre in Colorado, gives life to Margaret.  By the tone of voice she uses, I suspect that Margaret is a bit of a snob, but she handles the travails of the trail with remarkable good humor.   <br />It is particularly interesting that the diary does not end with their arrival in Sacramento, but gives a hurried account of life for their life as hotel owners and diary farmers. It is also interesting that the home they dismantled in Indiana and ship by boat, arrived in the new state at almost the same time they did.   <br />Thanks to the publication of this diary, I have a whole new appreciation of the Old West!	2002-05-30

Author/screenwriter John Blumenthal takes readers into a world that is definitely off beat with his new comedy novel, What's Wrong With Dorfman? Many think of screenwriters as alcohol-bingeing, cigarette smoking, gotta-meet-the-deadline backstory characters with little or no life of their own.  Ah how wrong they are! Blumenthal introduces Martin Dorfman, screenwriter and hypochondriac extraordinary.   <br />Everything is going semi-great in Dorfman's life---or as well as it can considering his occupation--until one day he awakes with all the symptoms of a massive hangover without ever having indulged.  Thus the whining begins. Dorman whines and frets, frets and whines, whines and frets while trying to get his latest screenplay into a serious producer.<br />Between trying to get his script into development by somebody, anybody, Dorfman tries in vain to find what's plaguing him. His father, a fastidious MD himself, makes a diagnosis, which Dorfman refuses to take seriously.  And along the way, he meets an equally whining hypochondriac, Delilah, who's role as straight man for the comedic adventures of Dorfman, are not without it's pathetic and poignant moments.<br />What's wrong With Dorfman? is well-crafted, well plotted book. From a writer's viewpoint I can see that Blumenthal has done an excellent job in crafting his scenes, characters, plot, and dialogue.  As a reader, I don't care much for slapstick, and, therefore, I have probably missed some of the finer points of this novel.  It was too over the top for me, but, like I said, I don't care for slapstick. However,if you want to see how comedy is written, pick up this one today!	2002-04-26

The long-awaited sequel to Eva McCall's first historical novel, The Edge of Heaven, is finally available.  <br />McCall's novels weave s together fact and fiction based on her real-life grandmother, Lucy Davenport Carpenter. The Edge of Heaven began in 1895 while Children of the Mountain jumps ahead to the late 1930s.  The thirteen children Lucy was married off to raise are now all grown up, in addition to the four that Lucy and her husband, Holman, had together.  <br />Holman is now in his eighties; Lucy in her sixties.  Holman lays dying in the bedroom he and Lucy have shared since building their own home on Carpenter Mountain.  But trouble is a-brewin'.  Mary, one of Lucy's stepdaughters, is concerned about who will inherit Carpenter Mountain, the mountain her birth Ma's family gave her as a dowry.  Mary is certain that unless something is done to make things right, Lucy's three surviving children will fall heir to her precious mountain.  Mary stirs up trouble amongst her birth siblings and tries to persuade them to make their Pa make things right before he passes.<br />It's not only Mary who's creating an uproar.  Holman, the controlling man that he is, insists the boys make his coffin and puts it on display in the parlor.  And Jake the peddler, with whom Lucy had had a heart-only affair, returns to add his two cents worth of rabblerousing to the boiling pot. He plants a envelope of gold dust on Mary's kitchen table to help raise the stakes and tries to court Lucy again even before Holman is gone.<br />However, it may all be a mute point.  After Holman's passing, the family learns that he never paid the taxes on the mountain and if the family doesn't raise $300 by spring, they'll all be homeless.  If they can scrap together $20 each, they may be able to save their ancestral home.  But cash is hard to come by---the children and their families live hand to mouth, even those who have moved acrossthe country to Washington state to work in the logging industry.  Can Carpenter Mountain be saved for the Carpenter family?<br />At first I was disappointed that Children of the Mountain jumped so far head.  But the more I read, the more I became captivated by McCall's storytelling.  Readers are caught up with the characters' lives mainly through exposition, which I found disconcerting as a writer.  However, readers get a good, clear idea of what's happened to Lucy, Holman and the kids, but I am still captivated by Lucy, the central character.  I know there is more to the story and I hope that McCall is planning another novel.	2002-04-03

While the mini-series, Rose Red, Stephen King created for ABC fell way, way short of expectations, his foray into the mind of an early 20th-century socialite is well, well, done.  I love ghost stories about old houses and this is what drew me to the first two hours of the mini-series and to the novel, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red. And what a fun read it is, creepiness and all!<br />The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red is supposedly edited by a real-life paranormalist, Joyce Reardon, but the rumor mill in the industry claims that Reardon is none other than the King of Creepy (no pun intended), Mr. King himself!  I couldn't find a trace of the actual existence of a John and Ellen Rimbauer, although I admit that I didn't do a heck of a lot of research, so they may or may not be formerly real people.  But the diary does paint a twisted scenario that is truly worthy of King's abilities.<br />In the forward Reardon/King tells us that she found the diary at an estate sale in 1998 and became so fascinated with the house (Rose Red) and the household that she will lead an psychic team into the abandoned, sprawling Seattle mansion, which then becomes the basis for the mini-series.<br />The diary begins with the courtship and extreme naivete of Ellen, whose last name the reader is never given (It may or may not be Gilchrist, as that is name of Ellen's great-grandmother.), and John Rimbauer. Anyway, as Ellen is lusting after her much-older suitor, she confides her thoughts to the pages of her diary.  John is building a grand mansion---such as to match his fortune and his ego.  On Ellen's first visit to the construction site, a man is killed right before her eyes, which eventually only becomes one of many deaths.<br />John and Ellen marry and embark on a yearlong, around-the-world honeymoon where they buy and buy and buy furnishings and decorations for their new home.  The honeymoon is also the beginning of John's controlling nature and Ellen eludes to many debaucheries in the name of sex, but mercifully does not go into intimate detail---as a woman of her breeding and statue would dictate.  While in Africa, the Rimbauer's hire Sukeena, who becomes Ellen's personal maid. <br />Upon returning to Seattle, the newlyweds settle in and begin to enjoy an active social life, beginning with a huge inauguration party.  But soon after the party, Rose Red seems to come to life.  Desperate to find an answer, Ellen visits a physic that tells her that she is safe---that the STD she contracted from John in Africa will never return, her fears of insanity and her fear of another STD from John's continued infidelity are groundless---as long as she continues to add to the house.  <br />And so begins the construction; the eerie disappearances of several friends and servants; the oddities of John's sexual inclinations; and the unveiling of Ellen's own excursions into what could be deemed as sexual perversions.  The disappearance of Ellen's second child, April, pushes the story to a dramatic conclusion that is just past the point of Ellen's sanity.<br />Reardon/King does a remarkable job in giving the readers just enough clues to let his/her own imagination run rampant, which makes The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red even more frightening.  You won't be going to bed with the lights out with this one.	2002-03-30

Henry Burke & Dick Croy's historical novel, The River Jordan, is an important book.  It's not the best written, it's not the best plotted, the dialect is distracting, and the dialogue somewhat predictable, but it doesn't matter.  This is an important book because for the first time in a long time, in my recent memory anyway (and I'm no expert), readers have the opportunity to learn about some of the people who traveled and conducted the Underground Railroad.<br />Mixing fact with fiction, Burke & Croy use the escape of a slave named Jane and her seven children in August 1843.  The reproduction of an Ohio newspaper article about the escape and a copy of the reward poster give the story an authenticity that otherwise may be lacking.<br />When Jane discovers that her two oldest sons, Alfred and Augustus, are about to be sold down the river, she takes action.  She's already lost her husband to the slavers and is not about to let her sons leave her. With the help of the Underground Railroad, Jane and her family cross the Ohio River and head for Canada where they will be free, as long as they don't commit any crimes, however.   An escape attempt by this many people at one time is not the usual escape.  But Jane is determined, and she and her family set out on a dark, foggy night.<br />What follows the family's escape route, how they avoided the posse led by their owner, Solomon Harness, a glimpse of those who conducted the line, and a topograhy of Ohio.  As I mentioned earlier, the book isn't well written, too much is trying to be covered in too little space and the sentence fragments drove me nuts, letters from the Civil War between two of Jane's youngest sons are ill-placed and jarring.  However, I enjoyed Jane's story and could feel the desperation she must have felt. I think that The River Jordan is a must for every public and school library across the country.  By putting names and faces together with a story, children (and adults) learn more easily; The River Jordangives reader pause to think about the people who put themselves in harm's way so they could be free or they could help some enjoy the freedoms they already knew.	2002-03-01

In his first novel, A Ballplayer's Choice, Reed Lengel gives young adults special lessons in dealing with ethics and honesty in this well-written, fun story. <br />Mike Mazar loves baseball; he eats, drinks and sleeps it, but an unusual summer challenges Mike and his best friend, Rafa Ortega.  Coach Chew, head coach of Tampa's Little League All-Star Team, wants Mike and Rafa on his team.  Desperately.  Both are exceptional players, but Mike isn't old enough to meet the age qualifications.  Chew amends Mike's birth certificate so that he qualifies for the team. Mike plays along, after all this is his dream. Mike begins to feel that all isn't right when he watches Chew cheat an elderly couple out of a few dollars for a couple of doughnuts.  Then during the big game, Mike misses second base.  What does he do?  Go on to third and win the game or go back and risk losing the championship?  <br />Mike's decision is met with a meeting with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and a change to the batboy at a Yankees pennant game.<br />Even non-baseball lovers of the sport will enjoy watching Mike's decision-making process and come to grips with events that will change his life.  The story is fast-paced and the characters are exceptionally defined. The secondary characters, Rafa, his sister, Maria, and Mike's sister, Erin, lend an air of realism to Lengel tale.  <br />On the down side, Rafa's deceased father, who was considered the greatest player in Puerto Rico, is reminiscent of the late Roberto Clemente.  Young readers probably won't make the connection, but parents, librarians and reviewers will probably see the resemblance.  <br />A Ballplayer's Choice is an excellent novel for both boys and girls who love the sport.  While the lessons are obvious to adult readers, younger readers will identify with Mike and the problems he has to face, and long the way, will give them something to dream about.	2002-03-01

Walker when I read The Black Rose by Tananarive Due in 2001.  It was an exciting, well-written novel.  I only became more entranced by this forgotten figure of history when the Due paid a visit to St. Louis that same year.  In reviews I wrote in March and April of that year, I declared Madam to be my own heroine.<br />Although a year has passed, I've have read more about this fascinating woman.  And the best evidence is the biography of her life, On Her Own Ground: The Life And Times of Madam C. J. Walker, written by her great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles.  <br />For those of you who don't know much about this remarkable late 19th-/early 20th century, here's a brief history lesson: Walker was born Sarah Breedlove in 1867 in Delta, Louisiana, and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, during her early adulthood.  While laboring as a washerwoman there during the 1890s, she began to go bald.  To control her hair loss, she developed a scalp treatment that made hair grow, which she claimed came to her in dream.  During the early 1900s she became a sales agent for Annie Malone's hair care treatment, but felt hers was the better product. She marketed her product on the side, while working for Malone.  In 1905, she married C. J. Walker, changed her name to \\"Madam C. J. Walker\\" and moved to Denver as an agent for St. Louis hair-care queen Annie Malone.  In 1906, she formed her own company, the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, which would come to dominate the hair business until the mid 1980s and ultimately give her the financial means to empower her gender and her race.  When she died at her elaborate New York mansion, Villa Lewaro, in 1919, she was the wealthiest African-American woman in the nation.  Many believed her estate to be worth more than $1 million dollars, but in actuality, the estate was estimated at $600,000 (about $6 million in 2002 figures).<BR> <BR>Bundles sets the record straight on Madam's life.  Due, who was commissioned by the estate of the late Alex Haley, admits her book is more fiction than fact, but Bundles gives the factual part.  From her rise as a child of freed slaves to the queen of hair culturalists, Walker was determined to make a better life for blacks in the United States.  She supported anti-lynching laws, tussled with Booker T. Washington over women's issues, and took on the elite of her race in a variety of issues.  She gave money to many causes, but only to those that served to better either other women or other blacks.  She held parties, attended rallies and marches, and traveled the United States as much as possible, empowering women of the new century.<br />Bundles doesn't give many anecdotes about her famed ancestor's life.  In fact, there isn't a whole lot of really personal information.  The book is mostly about the times of Walker.  If you've ever thought that blacks before Rosa Parks weren't concerned about segregation and other issues, you've got an eye-opener of a read awaiting you. On Her Own Ground: The Life And Times of Madam C. J. Walker is the riveting story of a woman destined to become a powerful figure and make a mark, her mark, on the landscape of the United States race issue.  Madam Walker is still one of my heroines, and I hope she will become one of yours too.	2002-03-01

The book is a big seller during the holiday season and the movie versions practically equal the number of times It's a Wonderful Life is shown each year. But how did Dickens come to write this classic Christmas tale?<br />In her first novel, A Midnight Carol: A Novel of How Charles Dickens Saved Christmas, Patricia K. Davis gives readers a &quot;who, what, where, when, how&quot; scenario on the creation of this classic tale. In Davis' rendering, the well-known author has been experiencing a bit of a slump in his book sales and a smidgen of writer's block. He and his wife, Catherine, and their four children are about to be evicted from their stately home at the fashionable address: One Devonshire Terrace.  And only to add to his troubles, Catherine announces that child number five is on its way.<br />The food becomes scarcer, the servants haven't been paid in weeks, and holidays are fast approaching. Dickens has a dream about the long-dead Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, and the man who took the &quot;merry&quot; out of &quot;merry ol' England.&quot;  Coincide the dream with the meeting of a very poor boy with a limp and a crutch, and voile!  The Tale begins to perk in the writer's head.<br />Davis recounts an excellent tale with an old-fashioned 19th century feel to it that would make Dickens proud.  It's even published in with a time-era feel.  But Davis never really gets into the writing of the piece.  All the reader gets to see is a glimpse of what is going around Dickens and then, suddenly, the manuscript is at the printer, destined to become one of the greatest books of all time.  But wait!  Dickens' rather unscrupulous publisher, Ledbook and Squid, try to deter the selling of the novel so that Dickens will be forced to turn over all rights to the story to them.<br />A Midnight Carol will never achieve classic status, but it is a fun holiday read, a charmingfeel-good tale that is sure to put the reader into the holiday spirit.	2002-02-04

Books	3	2	5	N	N	Could be but skeptical	When I was a kid I would have killed for a book like this!  I collected autographs for my &quot;Hall of Fame Photo Gallery.&quot;  It was so frustrating to just send a request to a movie or television studio, and maybe, just maybe, I'd get an autographed picture.<br />But now that I'm a grown-up, I'm a tad skeptical of this sort of thing.  2002 Celebrity Address Book claims to have over 13,000 valid addresses of public figure including politicians, military figures, authors, and movie and TV stars.  I didn't bother to make an actual count but was a little disturbed that there weren't any page numbers and the print is so tiny that it's difficult to read. While the publisher makes no guarantee that the celebrities haven't moved or will answer you letter, this could be (keys words being &quot;could be&quot;)shortcut around studios and agents.  I don't know the reputation of this publishing company or how they managed to obtained this usually heavily-guarded information, but to a charity, a budding author, or an autograph collector, this could be (again those key words) valuable information.  If I ever get my novel finished, I'll be looking for celebrity endorsements, and this is a perfect start to that task.	2001-12-21

However, I got out a kick out of Elyse Creger's novel, Feline Online, staring the lovable Siamese, Tarzan.  Tarzan is an adventurous little guy and, I believe, his learning to read is just the beginning of a series of books about the almond-shaped eyed feline.  <BR> Tarzan's, along with his companion's Foo Foo, mistress, Amanda, is determined to join the Good Old Days Garden Club.  But first she must past muster with the other club members.  This ladies club does everything the old-fashioned way---just like in Victorian times, from dressing to speech patterns and attitudes to hairstyles.  Amanda is excited about the prospect of joining this club. However, first Amanda, a seamstress by trade, must venture to New York City to attend the Fabric and Costume Trade Show.<BR> The day before she is to leave, a brand new computer arrives, and she barely has time to take it out if the box before she must leave. Amanda leaves Tarzan and Foo Foo in the care of her next door neighbor, Emily.  Upset that their being left and aggravated by Amanda's lack of attention, causes Tarzan to begin creating havoc in Amanda's sewing room and accidentally learns about her computer, which is doing some interesting things, with some help from his furry little paws.<BR> Semi-order turns to chaos as Tarzan orders a live, exotic bird that is delivered while Amanda is away via the Internet.  Hilarity erupts when Amanda returns and is in the midst of her garden party.<BR> Cregar's Feline Online is interesting and often hilarious.  The ending is rather unsatisfactory as it never comes to a real conclusion or solve any problem; I felt set up for a sequel.  However, Crege's work shows promise.	2001-11-29

Roberts put all three in this new novel.  Good point:  Interesting twists on the ghosts....I kept saying no, no...but it was true.

US	50106175	R3BWTABN2K4LTK	0967060613	882135501	Perestroika Sunset	Books	1	2	5	N	N	Did we?	The subject matter of Alan Stang's novel, Perestroika Sunset, addresses an issue that has always plagued me since the first time learned of this possible topic: did we leave POWs behind in Vietnam?  And Korea?  Did our government considered these brave heroes expendable to get out of the quagmire they had created?<BR> That is the bottom line of this novel.  However, whoever wrote the book jacket cover didn't read the book.  Labeled as &quot;A Daughter's Lifelong Search For Her MIA Father In Vietnam,&quot; only a portion of the book is devoted to this quest.  The events surrounding her efforts are not credible and do not seem authentic, especially the revelation that she is a Marine at the end of the book it so surprising that it rings untrue.  No hints are given throughout the book's 522 pages that this is a possible scenario.<BR> The inside book jacket also says that the novel is about four men:  Jason Fawkes, a Marine POW left behind; Dave Cord, who had promised to come back and get him after Fawkes saved his life on &quot;The Day&quot;; a Russian intelligence agent, General B. E. Kariloff, who is intent on toppling the United States government; and the fourth, a dead ringer for Fawkes and Soviet agent who will try to take his place when the U.S. brings the long-lost POWs home.  The press release I received with the review request listed all of the major players (a total of eight) in this work.  It's too bad that Stang didn't put include them in the novel; it might have been easier to follow.  <BR> The fact that the book addresses the issues of men left behind is the high point of the novel.  Another is that readers get a good feel for life in Southeast Asia.  <BR> The events in the novel's first seven chapters happen to quickly to be believable.  Fawkes's and Cord's exploits are well done and believable, but only from an outsider's point of view.  I don't feel that the author ever visited Vietnam nor, I felt, did he speak with any of the POW/MIA families or former POWs themselves.  <BR> The ending of the novel is too &quot;told.&quot;  The old rule of fiction---show, don't tell---is missing in the very last chapter.  It feels that Stang got tired of writing and just conveniently rapped up all the loose ends, which disappointed this reader to no end.  <BR> Perestroika Sunset makes readers wonder whether the possibility of soldiers still being held in captivity.  However, most can wonder by themselves without having to wade through 522 pages.	2001-10-30

Nwokogba's new memoir, America, Here I Come. The book recounts Nwokogba's journey to America from Nigeria to America based on spirituality rather than any other form of why people come to America. <br />Nwokogba asserts that God/the Infinite Source/Cosmic Law, or whatever you want to call it, controls our lives. We're set on a path, placed in a certain place, doing a certain job for a reason.  God has given us all a job to do and directs us in doing that job.  <br />A believer in reincarnation, Nwokogba stresses that each individual is on this planet for a purpose and that we return time and time again until we reach a spiritual level that coincides with the Infinite Source.  Whatever lessons, whatever wrongdoings we did in a previous life, must be atoned for in this life, or the next, or the next.  I'm not sure where I stand on reincarnation, but Nwokogba points out that the soul never dies...interesting, thought-provoking ideas that each individual must resolve in their own minds.  Pro-choicer's will have a field day in that Nwokogba states that life doesn't begin until birth...another issue I'm not exactly sure where I stand.<br />Another fascinating aspect of the book is the issue of racism.  Looking at this issue from a different set of eyes, it's interesting to see how this man was treated when he came to the United States.  I wish that he had given the year(s)when he immigrated to America.  I would be interested to know if that was a more recent experience, or something that happened, say ten, fifteen, twenty years ago.<br />America, Here I Come is a thought-provoking, interesting work, regardless of your point of view.  It is well written and flows very well.  There is no extraneous information that gives distracts the reader nor is it preachy, with Nwokogba trying to convince the reader of his point of view.  It is a true memoir in that that is what he believes, what he saw, and what he felt.	2001-10-12
US	50106175	R1EMU4ADRGK1AE	1588511154	280206980	Going Under	Books	3	1	1	N	N	The good and the bad	Gregory Doll's debut novel, Going Under, has a lot going for it, and a lot going against it.  The plot centers on a spoiled college senior, James Whitmore, who hasn't yet learned to manage his own life.  Therefore, he allows his friends and the world around shape the road he takes, which isn't always the best one.  As a family secret comes back to him in bits and pieces, James winds up getting severely beaten in a random act of violence that does ultimately change the course of his life.<br />The good points: most of the novel is cohesive and flows well; the mixture of past and present interfere with the tale at just the right times, giving the novel an edginess that makes the readers squirm.  The random act of violence illustrates what our society has reduced itself too.  The family secret is a good one, an unusual twist.  As readers, we don't often get tales of what can drive college students and this is a good example of what many students, away from home for the first time, have to deal with.<br />The bad points: while the author needs to know every teeny-tiny detail about the characters, the reader doesn't. For example, there is long exposition of Angela's (James female obsession) life that is not necessary and irrelevant.  The main fault with the book is that the reader seems distant from the action and the characters, and so does the author.  I never felt like I was involved in James' life, merely a detached observer, and I felt the author felt the same way.  We never know what James is really thinking.  The story is told from the third person point of view and, in my opinion, should have been told from a first person point of view.  It would have made the characters and the situation more believable.  Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy of life, which James tries to emulate, isn't really spelled out and isn't clear, to either James or the reader.<br />Going Under is a worthy first novel.  Once Doll finds his voice, he'll make a great storyteller.	2001-10-11

Jenner's new work, Across the Sweet Grass Hills, is an innocently mesmerizing novel that takes places in the Montana Territory of the late 1860s and early 1870s. <br />Reverend Ralston is following his dream to move into the Western frontier to live and preach among the Pikuni Indians, one of the three bands that made up the Blackfoot, of which, according to Jenner, was the most aggressive of the Plains Indians Tribes.  Before leaving St. Louis his two sons turned his back on him.  His wife died at the last fort they encountered.  His spoiled, pampered daughter, Elizabeth, wishes she would die rather than face life among the heathen Indians.    <br />The story opens as Liza, her father, and their guide, Giles, are under attack.  But who is actually attacking is unclear. Jenner wants us believe it's Indians, but there is a hint that the attackers are not who the Reverend believes them to be. Giles is mortally wounded and Ralston's condition is critical.  Liza fears for his life.<br />Red Eagle, half white and half Pikuni, happen across the young woman and her wounded father on his way to meet his mother's tribe.  He stitches Ralston up and basically saves the day.  Red Eagle and Liza each develop feelings for each other, although Liza doesn't understand hers and Red Eagle doesn't act upon his. Liza sends Red Eagle away, a move she is soon to regret as she comes under attack, twice, again.  Although there are three full pages of reference materials at the novel's end, the dialogue to stereotypical of a 1950s B movie.<br />Liza and Red Eagle's adventures to actual commit to one another and to spend their lives together is also stereotypical 1950s Indian adventure story.   Yet, I found the novel enjoyable.  I knew what was going to happen before it happened, but I didn't care---I just kept reading.  Once I got past the naïve innocence of the novel, the biggest problem I had was with the characters' name.  There are way too many character names that begin with &quot;R&quot; or &quot;C,&quot; which creates confusion for the reader.  The main characters are easily identified, but the other characters are easily confused and begin to intertwine with each other.  I wish Jenner had dug deeper with her character, but I don't believe that that was her intention. Across the Sweet Grass Hills is well written and flows well.  Seems to this reader that Jenner set out to write a feel good, happily-ever-after historical romance, and that's what she did.	2001-07-01

I always wondered about that; what would happen if the dead were brought back to life, decades, even centuries, after their deaths.  Karen Duvall's new novel, Project Resurrection, tackles this issue, more on a science-fiction/New Age level than from a realistic viewpoint.  The time is 2013, and many of the diseases that are currently incurable are no longer life threatening.<br />The novel takes the reader to Angakok, Alaska; the only place left in the world with air that can be breathed by humans.  The temperatures are always sub-, subzero.  There in Angakok, Project Resurrection is beginning to unfold.  Dr. Terrance Labriola, the Project's founder, has built an elaborate scientific laboratory dedicated to bringing the thirty cryogenics back to life. Surrounded by his team, Terrance has success with his first patient/experiment (David Bodine), only to have the patient retreat into an unexplainable coma.<br />One member of the team, LaNaya Seville-a physical therapist---has a special gift as a &quot;healer.&quot;  LaNaya also has the ability to leave her body, while her soul journeys to the astral plane---the level between Heaven and Hell.  This ability is a legacy from her Inua ancestors, an Alaskan tribe thought to be long annihilated.  Though LaNaya relishes her gift to help others, she is fearful of her &quot;dark&quot; side---the Inua are known to engage in sorcery and evil---though it has yet to surface.  <br />As the project continues, Terrance has more luck with the second patient/experiment. Kaiser is conscious, but he doesn't want to be resurrected; he was happy on the astral plane. He is unhappy in the new world he has yet to see outside his glass cubicle. LaNaya visits him on the astral plane, trying to determine the cause of David's coma.<br />With the success of Kaiser's reanimation, Labriola is ready to resuscitate his third patient/experiment, the person for whom he devoted his life to cryogenics, his gorgeous, still young, wife, Cassandra.  But something was horribly wrong with Cassandra's death and follows her into her return. LaNaya returns again and again to the spirit world to help Cassandra, Kaiser, and David.<br />At first, the plot of Project Resurrection was a little hard to understand what was happening.  But once the reader understands the situation, the plot becomes fascinating.  The story is sometimes fast paced, sometimes slow.  The battles between good and evil on the astral plane get a little redundant at times, but this novel is worth reading just to view the author's amazing imagination, if for nothing else.	2001-05-27

We know all the stories-how white men forced themselves on their black female slaves; the octoroon and mulatto who resulted from those unions; the hope of freedom; the field work; the housework; the cruel overseers.  There's nothing new in that arena in Lalita Tademy's debut novel, Cane River.  But what makes this work stand out from any of the others in this historical area, which takes place along the Cane River in Louisiana, is the women who pepper this compelling family saga.  <br />First we meet Elizabeth and her daughter, Suzette.  In her late thirties, Elizabeth seems much, much older, worn down by the burden of being a slave and her position as cook.  Her motto is &quot;We do what we have to to survive.&quot;  Suzette is a high-spirited girl who has enjoyed being the shadow of her owner's daughter, Oreline Derbanne.  Suzette cannot understand why she and her family are slaves, when there are free colored people living nearby. An white French immigrant and neighbor, Eugene Daurat, rapes Suzette and begins an affair with her that is rather odd, but intriguing.  Suzette bears him two children.   As time goes by, the plantation, Rosedew, the master, Louis Derbanne, dies.  Suzette and her daughter, her mother, and her deaf-mite sister go in one direction; her son in another.<br />Suzette's daughter, Philomene, grows up with a gift---the ability to see into the future----&quot;glimpsings.&quot;  Philomene is about to marry Clement, the love of her life, but she is forced into intimacy with a white man, Narcisse Fredieu.  Before Clement is sold away, she bears him twin daughters, but bears Fredieu eight. Philomene makes sure that Fredieu cares for his children by making certain the property on which he built them a home is in her name---security she calls it. The white stain Daurat started with Suzette is becoming more and more evident in each child that appears.<br />By the time we reach Emily's (Philomene's daughter) stage of life, there are four generations of colored women living under the same roof.  The children come from all over the Cane River area to have the dinner with Elizabeth and any other family member who can make it.  Emily's tale goes up to her death in 1936 and is the frame of the novel.  <br />Tademy, who quit her vice-presidency position at a Fortune 500 company to research her family roots, has done an excellent job in portraying each individual woman.  The names of the men, because they are French and resemble each other, are confusing and difficult to keep distinguished.  However, Cane River is a wonderfully-written novel that moves at a dramatic pace and digs deeper into the soul's of these women and their era with remarkable richness and complexity.	2001-04-18

But don't let the inspirational part dissuade you from reading this delightful new novel.<br />At almost fifty, Madge Brown is beginning to experience empty-nest syndrome.  Her oldest son, Geo, is away at college; 16-year-old Pam is heavily into her own life; new Chat Room friends consume her husband, George.  She feels lonely, dumpy, and just plain bored.  She can't remember the last time she wore makeup, had her hair fixed, or wore anything other than jeans and sneakers.<br />To help get her out of her doldrums, she answers an ad for a local StarWay Beauty Products representative (a.k.a. Avon, Tupperware, or Amway), much to George's chagrin. A complete makeover gives her the confidence she needs to try and find  herself---a term I personally despise.  She even gives herself a nickname: Middy.  With the help of rather aggressive StarWay district managers, she lands a lucrative route in the wealthy area of Denver, and the money begins pouring in.  Not that she needs it.  George has always taken excellent care of her and the children, even giving her an allowance.<br />As she works her route, she rums into some interesting characters.

In tow was his most talented student, fifteen-year-old Ferdinand Hiller.  Hummel and Hiller visited the dying genius many times during his last two months. Upon viewing the body, Hiller asks, and receives permission, from Hummel to snip a locket of the graying-brown hair as a keepsake.  It becomes the boy's most prized treasure.  He has it mounted in an oval locket, and it becomes a family heirloom for the next 100 years.  <br />After World War II, the locket turns up in Denmark, the custody of a doctor who helped hide, and maybe treat, Jews escaping Hitler's wrath.  How and why the locket gets to Denmark and into Kay Fremming's possession can only be theorized.  Martin does an excellent job in putting the facts he has been able to gather into a compelling and interesting tale.<br />In 1994 the locket came up for auction at Sotheby's.  Ira Brilliant and Che Guevara (not the Argentine radical), both Beethoven zealots, purchase the locket and begin to institute a series of 20th-century scientific tests that ultimately reveals more about the physical deficiencies of the musical genius.  <br />Beethoven's Hair is a written in an interesting style, alternating Beethoven's biography and the history of the locket with its sale and decision to perform scientific studies of the 500-odd strands of hair.  The story of Beethoven's life and the history of the locket are intertwined and often confusing.... especially when Martin only refers to other musical legends (Bhrams, Hayden, Mozart, etc) without completely defining their relationship with Beethoven. The journey of the locket is the most fascinating part of the book.  The tests performed upon the hairs and the creation of a Beethoven center at San Jose State University in California are a little dry, but well worth the time to read.  I came away from Beethoven's Hair glad I had learned new information about the great man, intrigued by modern science, and totally captivated by the locket's 170-year journey.	2001-03-24

Walker, America's First Black Female Millionaire	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A great start to learning about an extraordinary woman	I have a new heroine.  Not only did she rise above being black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but also she rose above being a black woman to become America's first female millionaire.  It's an incredible story.<br />Her name is Madame C. J. Walker and her story is fictionalized in Tananarive Due's historical novel, The Black Rose.  Based on the research and an extensive outline complete by famed author Alex Haley before his death in 1992, Due weaves a fascinating account of Walker and her times.<br />Madam C. J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove to freed blacks in 1867.  Sarah is proud that she is learning to read and write, and dreams of reading her mother's Bible and someday attending college.  Her dreams are crushed when her parents, now tenant farmers on the same Delta, Louisiana, farm where they were once slaves, die of yellow fever in 1874.  Eight-year-old Sarah and her siblings are left to struggle for survival on their own.  By 1878, the crops were failing and their shack was all but falling down. A year later, Sarah and her sister, Lou, move to Vicksburg, Mississippi, to become washerwomen.  <br />The work is grueling but mind numbing. At 14, Sarah marries Moses McWilliams, a man she grows to love with all her heart, but who is killed less than a year later in one of Mississippi's infamous race riots. Devastated and left with a daughter, Lelia, to care for, Sarah moves to St. Louis. Life there is hard, but Sarah still dreams of college, of learning to read without having to struggle with each word.  She has her own washing service and begins to save money so that Lelia can someday have the education she was categorically denied.  <br />St. Louis' Annie Malone begins a beauty supply business, hiring black women as representatives to sell the products door-to-door.  Sarah admires Annie, but her products do not bring relief to her own itchy dandruff and dry scalp that have tormented her since childhood.  In an effort to find relief, Sarah and Lelia being concocting different remedies in their kitchen.  Thanks to the help of a dream about a field of black roses and the treatment of sulfur to an injury Lelia sustains, Sarah stumbles onto the secret formula that make hair grown-she is a living example that it works.  A new business if founded!  <br />During this time she meets and marries C. J. Walker, an advertising whiz, and moves her business to Denver.  With the help of C. J., but more of her own ambition and determination, Sarah begins her beauty supply business, recruiting women to sell it door-to-door.  Before long, Sarah is the most sought after, most powerful woman, in America. Eventually she moves her business to Indianapolis and New York, where there is a more concentrated population of blacks.  <br />But the more time she spends working, the less time she has for Lelia and C. J.  The three grow estranged and by the time of her death in 1919, Madame C. J. Walker was the wealthiest, loneliest woman in the United States.  <br />The Black Rose is more fiction than fact, according to Due who was in St. Louis recently.  Scads of papers remain from The Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, which existed until the 1960s, but little personal documentation about this powerful woman have survived the years.  Due reviewed thousands of interviews, documents, and papers that Alex Haley has complied before she began writing.  &quot;I tried to be true to the spirit of Sarah Breedlove McWilliams Walker,&quot; Due said.  And from everything else I've read about this remarkable woman, Due has done as excellent job in capturing her essence.  The Black Rose is a powerful, captivating tale of a real-life heroine.	2001-03-24

Holman's novel is actually two genres in one: a murder mystery and a contemporary fiction piece about domestic violence.  The two stories wrap around Pharaoh Blue, both women's former lover and current savior.  While it's never clear exactly what Pharaoh does for a living, he seems to have plenty of time on his hands to help Billiemae and Maris.<br />Billiemae is sure, downright positive, that she killed her friend and next door neighbor, Amelia, when she threw a jar of salsa at a buzzing fly?  After all, Amelia was lying there in a pool of blood, not moving, staring straight ahead with dead eyes while a fly crawls on her nose.  Surely somebody will find out she did it; sooner or later an awful stink is going to drift down the hallway. <br />Begging Pharaoh for help is no easy matter. He's wrapped up in Maris' domestic problems.  But Billiemae convinces him to go to Amelia's apartment with her.  There they discover that Amelia is not lying dead on the kitchen floor, as Billiemae left her, but curled up in her bed with a bullet hole in her forehead.  Now it's up to the Billiemae and Pharaoh to solve Amelia's murder.  <br />As the sleuthing begins, Billiemae and Pharaoh discover that Amelia is not what she seems, a nice, lonely, lady, eager for company and a bit of gossip.  Amelia is into selling video pornography.  How she comes by these tapes and their connection to Maris becomes all too clear as Billiemae and Pharaoh comb Denver for clues and suspects.  <br />Sometimes hilarious and over-the-top comical, sometimes poignant, The Last Days Murder List is an interesting work and a unique first novel. The title doesn't make any sense and some of the secondary characters get lost when they appear later in thenovel, but don't let these minor infractions deter you from reading the first work from this promising new voice.  There are twists and turns that I never saw coming and one that made me gasp out loud. You'll laugh....you'll cry....what else can I say.	2001-03-24

US	50106175	R2QW7DT7QEEPU7	0914875272	554873692	Edge of Heaven	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A Slice of Heaven for Readers	At seventeen, Lucy Davenport has never ventured off the Georgia mountain  where she lived with her full-blooded Cherokee mother and her white father,  Edmund.  But it's 1895 and times are changing rapidly for the half-girl,  half woman.  Her two sisters have married and moved away, mother has  recently died and Lucy and her father are left alone to cope.  It's a hard  scrabble life there on the mountain with only her dead mother's spirit and  Jasper the dog to help her.<br />Holman Carpenter's wife had died six months  earlier, and he needs a wife to take of his thirteen children (ages  thirteen to six months).  Edmund and Holman make a deal in which Holman  takes Lucy as his wife, but it isn't until three-fourths through the book  that readers learn why Edmund consented to the deal.  <br />When they reach  his farm in North Carolina, Lucy meets the children.  Some like her, some  resent her, some don't even understand why she's there.  Lucy spends the  next two years plotting to run away.  Her Cherokee relatives are not too  far away, and she is sure that they'll take her in.  But the children, who  so desperately need someone to care for them, tug at her heartstrings.   Along the way, readers meet Jake the peddler who captures her heart and  offers her only real chance for escape; Bessie, the large, homely woman who  befriends the only girl-woman and teaches her to read; and the  children---Annie May and Dovey---who stand out as an ally and an enemy. The  scenes with Annie May and Dovey will both break your heart and make you so  mad that you want to slap some sense into the insolent girl.<br />As time goes  by, Lucy finds it harder and harder to leave her new home.  Although  sickness and death hover around her, it is love that finally surrounds  her.<br />EDGE OF HEAVEN takes readers back to what life must have really been  like in the late 1890s.  Thankfully Ms. McCall rarely brings up the issue  of Lucy's parentage (half white/half Cherokee).  Its delineationis done  very subtly, mainly through the use of teas and herbs that she learned from  her mother. Many readers judge a book by its first page and while this book  does a few flaws on page one, McCall corrects them beginning on page two,  and has developed a marvelous, fast-paced, taut, novel/biography. <br />EDGE  OF HEAVEN is McCall's first novel, and her talent for creating memorable  characters is remarkable.  I was upset when I reached the final page of  EDGE OF HEAVEN because I didn't want Lucy's story to end.  I wanted to know  how her life turns out there on the mountain.  However, as luck would have  it, I understand that Bright Mountain Books is nearing publication of a  sequel of this amazing novel titled &quot;Children of the Mountain.&quot;   I can't wait to get my hands on it!	2000-09-07

The primary story concerns itself with the abortion debate, but the secondary story, the point of view of the baby's father, is powerful and  refreshing.<br />Hannah Solace, an assistant high school principal, doesn't  feel that she has what it takes to be a mother.  She has no tenderness, no  maternal instinct, and no desire to multiply.  Not like her younger sister,  Helen, a housewife and mother of four.  But at the age of 40 and after  eight years of marriage, Hannah is pregnant and terribly frightened at the  prospect of motherhood.  She knows that her artist husband, Carl,  desperatly wants a child.  He's convinced that a baby will renew their  marriage and bring him happiness.  <br />But Hannah cannot bring herself to go  through with the pregnancy.  Without consulting Carl, she makes an  appointment at the local abortion clinic.  When she reaches the clinic, she  is met by a group from the Gospel Fellowship church, a non-demoninational  following, who try to disuade her from her desired course of action.  Carl  discovers what Hannah is about to do, but arrives much too late to save the  child.  The scene with him in the hallway of the clinic calling for Hannah  is gut-wrenching.<br />The pro-life demonstrators target Hannah and the other  women who had abortions that day.  They graffiti &quot;murderer&quot; and  &quot;babykiller&quot; on the women's homes in red and black paint.  News  coverage of the vandalism results in the women becoming objects of  fascination for the townspeople as they jam the suburban streets to catch a  glimpse of the destruction.<br />Carl seeks solace in his painting, in his job  as bookstore manager at the mall, and in Penny Reed, one of the  congregation picketing that awful morning.  I was waiting for a romance to  develop between Carl and Penny, but Warner did not stoop that low.<br />Sharon  Oard Warner does an excellent job in protraying both sides of the abortion  debate without making a case for either side.  Instead, she hearlds one  point of view that is hardly ever considered--the father's.  The story is  fast-paced, simple and powerful.  The characters are complex, distinctly  drawn and unique.  The only major fault with Warner's tale is how the  Gospel Fellowship acquired the women's names and addresses.  <br />I couldn't  put this book down.	2000-04-17
US	50106175	R3P2JBWODOX9X6	0312246560	56919881	The Phantom of Manhattan	Books	2	2	3	N	N	A Not-So-Worthy Attempt	Frederick Forsyth's attempt at a sequel to Gaston Leroux's 1911 classic, Phantom of the Opera, is a not-so-worthy effort.  <br />Forsyth flucuates between many different points of views in order to fill in the gaps where  readers left Erik in 1894 Paris and the current time setting of 1906  Manhattan.  The beginning of the novel, especially the recreation of the  voices of Madame Giry and Erik, are well done.  <br />The novel opens with the  dying Madame confessing to Father Sebastian.  The confession answers the  main question left open by Leroux:  how Erik came to haunt the Paris Opera  House in the first place.  The setting then shifts to Manhattan and bridges  the years between 1894 and 1906.  Erik is now a very powerful, very  mysterious, very elusive corporate giant in a growing metropolis.   Trite,  but so far it's not totally devoid of imagaination.  After all, Erik was a  genius in many different fields.<br />Giry sends Erik a final letter.  A  French lawyer, Armand Dufour, arrives in New York, to hand deliver the  letter.  His English is poor, but he encounters Charles &quot;Cholly&quot;  Bloom, a reporter for the New York American, who helps him deliver the  letter.  Here the plot line turns unconvincing and contrived, worthy of a  beginning writer but not an icon like Forsyth.  <br />Forsyth imples that Erik  raped the young Christine Daae during the time he held her hostage beneath  the Paris stage.  They have a son, Pierre.  In order to see his son, Erik  commissions Oscar Hammerstein (not the musical legend, but his grandfather,  which is confusing because the familial relationship isn't revealed until  the epilogue) to build a opera house that will rival the palaces of  Manhattan and Paris. Through another frontmen, Darius (remember the  Perian's manservan?), Erik hires the world's greatest singers to debut a  new American opera, Angel of Shiloh, on opening night. To no surprise  Christine is employed to sing the lead role.  (Readers must be warned that  the plot line of Erik's original opera smacks heavily of Gone With the  Wind.) <br />Viscomtess Christine de Chagny (nee Daae and wife of Raoul)  doesn't discover the identity of her employer until after her arrival in  the States.  Erik sends Pierre a toy monkey that plays Masquarde when the  mechanical workings are reversed.  However, the fact that the boy even  thinks of reversing the mechancial insides with a brand new toy, is too  far-fetched to be believed.  Anyway, Christine now knows that it is Erik  who is behind the new opera, the new opera house, everything.  She is still  terrifed of him, but searches for a connection.  I must say that these few  pages are riveting and are what gives this novel its second star.   <br />Cholly, the reporter, always seems to be in the right place and the  right time which adds another whole level of unbelievability to the novel.   <br />The final chapter is a cheap plot device and is extremely predictable  and totally disappointing. I won't give it away, but readers will turn the  final page with disgust.<br />Thankfully, it is a rather short novel and a  quick read.  For those like me who was sure that it would get better, but  never did, it's shortness is a blessing.	2000-04-07

There he opens Sunny Medical Supply, a  medical and surgical supply store that becomes an informal clinic.  From  behind the counter, he dispenses free medical advice.  Not a doctor by  profession, Doc was, however, trained as a medical officer in the Imperial  Army.  <br />Thirty years later, he is now retired and spends his days  enjoying his status as a respected elder member of community, taking long  walks, lap swimming in the pool behind his house, and checking up on  friends and business acquanticies.  <br />However, a small houe fire nearly  kills him.  Overcome with smoke inhalation, he is rescued by Liv Crawford,a  persistent real estate agent who is desperately trying to convince the  seventy-year-old man that his home is just too big.  <br />While spending  several days in the hospital, Doc must come to terms with the relationships  in his life.  Never one to seek the company of women, and a life-long  bachelor, Doc regrets being unable to save his first (and really only)  love, Kkutaeh, from her fate as a comfort woman during World War II.  Then  there is ther mid-life realtionship with the late Mary Burns, a neighbor in  Bedley Run.<br />The most important relationship that he evaluates is the one  he had with his adopted Japanese daughter, Sunny.  The two never got along.   Doc doesn't understand where he went wrong. why couldn't the Japanese  adoption agency given a single father a son; he'd have been much more  capable of raising a son than a daughter.  He gave her everything, but as  she grows up, she gets involved with unsavory characters and drugs.  Doc  doesn't know why she became so hateful and distant and ran away at  eighteen.  These are questions that Doc know will never be answered.<br />Doc  accidentally discovers that Sunny, who he hasn't seen in thirteen years, is  living and working in the run-down neighboring community of Beddington.  He  also discovers that he is the grandfather of a six-year-old boy.<br />After he  learns of Thomas' existence, Doc goes out of his way to make contact with  Sunny.  She recultantly allows them to see each other, and soon the  emotional distant falls away.  <br />The characters in this novel, especially  Doc,  are complex, full of intricies that are not easily defined.  <br />There  are two problems with this book.  Kkutaeh and Mary's scenes are  chronological and easy to follow.  Sunny's tale is that like of her life  with Doc:  chaotic, tumultuous amd difficult for the reader to follow.  The  other problem deals with the book's time structure.  Doc supposedly meets  Sunny thirteen years after she has left him, but when he meets her and  Thomas, she is only twenty-three years old.  Just a little mathematical  error on the author and editor's parts.  But it's still worth the read.   The tone and feel of the novel are like a life well-lived.  Readers will be  sorry when the book ends and he/she must give up a new found friendship  with Doc Hata.	2000-03-13

With the little money her late husband left her, she wants to a open a book shop (the only store of its kind)in the tiny hamlet of Hardborough.  Thwarted by Mrs. Gamart, the local art enthusiast, Florence perservers in 1959 England.  Mrs. Green believes that  the property Florence purchased, the Old House, should be used as an art  gallery.  Businesses are dying fast in the economically struggling village.  Instead of supporting the first business venture in quite sometime, Mrs.  Gamart and the other villagers are bent on stopping the determined  Florence.  But Florence has other problems other than a disgrunteled  socialite. Her warehouse is damp, resulting in warped pages. The  five-hundred-year-old Old House, built out of earth, straw, sticks and oak  beams leaks, has seawater in its cellar, and is inhabited by a rather  friendly poltergiest.  Florence also runs into merchandising, personnel,  and distribution problems.  The widow Green does have one ally, the town  recluse.  The story culminates in Florence's ordering of the lastest  bestseller, &quot;Lolita,&quot; and the effect it has on the townspeople.   I would have like to seen more of the poltergeist. The ordinariness of  Florence's daily dilemas and her methods to solve them are at the center of  this novel. Fitzgerald gets to the heart of just how mean and spiteful  people can be to each other.	2000-03-08

Unlike &quot;The Manikin,&quot; her finalist 1997 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction novel, &quot;Make Believe&quot; is dis-jointed, the tone---which should be ominous---is blase, the characters are indistinguishable from each other,  and the core of the book is barely discussed.  &quot;Make Believe&quot; the  story of newly orhaned, Bo, a bi-racial child.  Both sets of grandparents  are trying to obtain custody of the child.  The African-American  grandparnets have nutured and loved the boy since his conception; the white  grandparents hae refused to acknowledge his existence. Until now.  The  white grandparents somehow manage to gain temporary custody of the boy, but  it is unclear how this happens.  the custody battle is only alluded too and  is not fully developed.  The book's language consists mostly of abstract  internal dialogue that is confusing and does nothing to push the story  along.  Guess they all can't be Pultizer Prize Finalist's.  Please try  again Ms. Scott, you really area wonderful writer.	2000-02-05
