This is a handy and informative book for two kinds of people--those who are going to Turin, Italy for the Winetr Olympics and those who are going there some other time for some other reason. I'm just back from Turin (the latest of several visits), so my memory is refreshed enough to say that James Sajo has created an awfully good guide that is compact and easy to use. Olympics fans will appreciate the tight, informative focus on the Games' schedule and the venues within and without the city. And there are excellent tips on how to survive the outdoor venues (bring food and bring, use sunscreen liberally and take something to sit on). Both kinds of visitor will find excellent guidance on hotels, sites, dining and wines. All this in a format that will fit easily in an inside jacket pocket.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning travel writer who travels to Italy several times a year.	2005-10-12

Mort Rosenblum has at last seen the error of his ways. After his award-winning \\"Olives\\" of a few years ago and then a gastronomical ramble called \\"A Goose in Toulouse,\\" he recognized that his day job as an Associated Press correspondent was a waste of his time and, more important, his wide-ranging talent and generous sensibility. And so with no wars or economic calamities to deal with he has devoted himself to chocolate, and we should be grateful for that, and for this book.<br /><br />Whether you're an initiate of such dark secrets as Italy's magnificent newcomer, Amedei, or mired in the outer darkness of Hershey's and the grossly overrated Godiva, you will find your mouth watering with the very first chapter. Rosenblum throws himself into his subject and takes the reader with him on extraordinary journeys: to Oxaca, Mexico, to plumb the secrets of mole sauce (which is traditionally for turkey, not chicken, and is supposed to be made in platoon-feeding quantities. To Sao Tome and Principe, two islands so far out that Fernando Po (what?) is a near neighbor, where a mildly unhinged Italian is planning to rebuild a tradition of fine chocolate. To West Africa, where cacao growers who suffer from thieving governments and armed rebels took another blow when a half-witted BBC report accused them of using slave labor. To Belgium and Switzerland which, reputation to the contrary, produce mostly mass-market chocolate on an industrial  scale. To England where (as usual) what they eat will scare your pants off. To the U.S., where we get the lowdown on Hershey and Mars but get good news, too, about Steve DeVries in Denver and Scharffen Berger in California: Both are moving steadily in the direction of the French. And they are not alone: Vere (pronounced 'vair-ray') just opened in New York City, offering fine chocolate made exclusively from rare a Ecuadorian variety.<br /><br />And of course Rosenblum takes us to France--all of chocolate-making France, not justParis.<br /><br />France is where, Rosenblum says, chocolate reaches transcendence. Not only chocolate--the basic stuff of the plain, unadorned chocolate bar--but chocolates (note the plural), which are filled and frilled and decorated and molded. In short, they are confections or candies. Rosenblum takes us into the workshops and passions of chocolatiers who are as devoted and creative as any Michelin 3-star chefs. And just as independent and secretive. These artists would have fit right in at the Sun King's Versailles.<br /><br />There's other stuff here, and it's all good, rich, satisfying stuff: chocolate and health, chocolate \\"addiction,\\" chocolate as an aphrodisiac, and the great enemy of chocolate-lovers everywhere: the cosmetics industry, which is buying up cocoa butter as fast as it can so women can smear it on their faces! As outrages go, that's surely among the worst, just as this book is surely among the best.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor in New York.

US	48778664	R2SK6BF36ALTG9	0071449027	580294696	In the Wake of the Jomon: Stone Age Mariners and a Voyage Across the Pacific	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Hair-Raising Adventure	By Bill Marsano. \\"In the Wake of the Jomon\\" starts poorly--too much prattle. In 1996 a couple of collegians frolicking in/near/around Kennewick, Washington discovered the skull of a fellow soon to be called Kennewick Man. He was a Jomon, one of a Stone Age tribe from 9,500 to 20,000 years ago that had settled in, of all places, Japan. How came he to Washington? Turk thinks it possible he came not by the Bering Land Bridge but by boat. The Land Bridge explanation for early immigrations is, it seems, a little too simple. Fair enough--we need this background. The irksome part is the relentless blue-skying about WHY. Were the Jomon fleeing hunger or enemies? Misfortune or mayhem? Or were they (drumroll, please!) fired by man's inborn spirit of adventure?<br /><br />I can put up with a certain amount of this but not too much, which is what Turk has on offer. So much so that toward the end, when he actually produces something more interesting on the subject, I almost missed it, having long since become used to skimming.<br /><br />But all right--that's the worst of it, and not really so terrible, just an irritant that made me want to yell \\"Shut up and paddle!\\" every so often. When Turk gets the show on the road he begins producing a very fine book. It follows the old Kon-Tiki routine, and a good one it is: tracing the presumed route to turn speculation into plausibility. It offers many possibilities and he makes the most of them.<br /><br />Turk plans to sail from northeastern Japan to St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. His is no National Geographic expedition, where suffering means only having to load your own film. He has three tiny Wind Riders (plastic trimarans) donated by the manufacturer, some Gore-Tex, some Polartec. He's got his skillful accomplice Franz and a Russian translator, hired over the internet, who proves to speak almost no English and whose experience of water is confined to bathtubs. He cracks and splits after a week.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil this adventure but must give a few details beyond the murderous shear waves and the killer surf and the whirlpool so wide Turk didn't recognize what it was until he was in it. So: Only a third of the way along, safety and sanity dictate quitting and returning next year. Round Two is much the best part. Now Turk sets out with his wife, Chris, some Prijon Kodiak kayaks and, best of all, a translator who speaks more than one language. This is Mischa, an unlikely but utterly wonderful hero. He joins the expedition knowing that survival at sea is unlikely (he too has no boating experience) but that death ashore is certain: His stressful and ulcerous office job will kill him, literally, unless he escapes to what he calls \\"the wild nature.\\"<br /><br />Putting his ego in a shoebox, Turk lets Mischa have the stage, for it is Mischa who earns it, who won't give up; when even Turk knows it's senseless to go on, Mischa simply won't be stopped. \\"Labor and defend,\\" he cries, loosely translating an old Soviet slogan while launching into nightmare. \\"We must paddle to Alaska by our own hands,\\" he reminds whenever Turk feels daunted. Turk's generosity here is admirable, and so is his writing skill: He brings all this alive and into focus so that you almost watch this book as you read it. (It would make a fine movie on the order of \\"Dersu Uzala.\\")<br /><br />Turk and Mischa become boon companions as they meet and master the usual obstructions: filthy weather, stiff-necked officialdom, short rations, incessant discomfort and worse. They also meet and are helped (once being pulled from the surf by a tank) by a wonderfully odd assortment of people who live in lonely privation on the miserable shores farthest-east Russia, but who somehow understand and welcome explorers in any language. This is a book you won't lend out.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor, and a marginally competent kayaker to boot.	2005-08-12

I admit that I'm crabby and cranky and opinionated and cynical; I come from another century and am set in my ways. I'm older than Calvin Coolidge put together. And sometimes I have bad days. That said, I'm always leery of titles loaded with words like \\"only\\" and \\"ultimate\\" and \\"last.\\" They give me the blue creevies.<br /><br />Still, Heacox starts off pretty nicely; his tree-huggery is drowned out by his early adventure--some 25 years ago--as a sort of apprentice ranger at Glacier Bay, Alaska. He's on a kayak trip with another apprentice, one Richard, a fellow whose outlook is summed nicely in \\"I may not know karate, but I know cra-a-a-azy!\\" He never forgets the beer and can cook, too. I'd enjoy camping with Richard but not with Heacox. His idea of pitching in seems to be picking out Beatles tunes on his guitar. (He is obsessed with the Beatles, you will learn, and if you have a soft spot for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" you're going to get a bellyful.)<br /><br />After the early paddling, things go downhill. Heacox, it develops, loves the wilderness too much; he is the worst friend a glacier ever had. He is the exemplar of those \\"elitists\\" who want the wilderness for themselves at the expense of ordinary tax-payers. He says (repeatedly) that he wants to be \\"the only kayay(er)\\" and he means it. Letting other people in will just wreck the place--his wilderness, which he thinks to possess by dint of devotion.<br /><br />As a spokesman for wilderness, Heacox leans on mantras and slogans, and in a radio debate, as president of the Friends of Glacier Bay, he is a tongue-tied failure. Later, affecting to emulate the gutsy Richard, who dared invite a ferocious anti-conservationist to lunch, he phones Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, who dreams nightly of oil-drilling in the Arctic. To the answering assistant he identifies himself as \\"Jim Peacock,\\" a \\"conversationalist\\" who \\"work[s] on cruise ships . . .I talk to people.\\" We're supposed to smile atHeacox's wit here, for this is an in-joke cleverly planted earlier in the book. We're not supposed to notice that he's being a smart-ass; that he's sabotaging his own efforts. He is, by the way, tongue-tied most of the rest of the time, too. Having little of his own to say he incessantly quotes his betters, who include John Muir, Daniel Boorstin, Blaise Pascal, Julian Barnes, Cezanne and three-fourths of the Beatles. And more, but soon I wearied of counting. The most important of them is Muir, who--can anyone not know it?--was founder and first president of the Sierra Club and the Father of our National Parks, beginning with Yosemite. People came from miles around to see Yosemite; Muir called them \\"scum.\\" And that's where Heacox is coming from.<br /><br />It is, really, all over for wilderness so far as Heacox is concerned. Situation hopeless! People keep coming! What little is left he wants to keep for his selfish only-kayak self. Indeed, married twenty years, he and his wife are childless, suggesting no faith in the future, while and his \\"close friends\\" are always distant friends. Their occasional great reunions are no substitute for the demands of day-in/day-out friendship (but ever an excuse to break out his bloody guitar).<br /><br />Heacox has perfected an attitude of whimpering self-righteousness and is a master of the non sequitur. After not getting any landscaping advice from his friend Michio Hoshino, who is \\"gone\\" (i.e., dead), we get \\"A raven landed in a nearby snag and watched.\\" Heavy, huh? Or after a brief reference to Alexis de Tocqueville: \\"The French don't know everything. Nobody does.\\" My favorite comes after he tells a story on one of his cruise-ship gigs:<br /><br />  A woman asked me if John Muir was my hero.<br /><br />  My hero? I suppose he is, in a way . . .<br /><br />  Have you ever heard of Michio Hoshino?<br /><br />  She had not. Nobody on that ship had.<br /><br />  What was it Fitzgerald said?  \\"Show me a<br /><br />  hero and I willwrite you a tragedy.\\"<br /><br />There's a certain kind of person for whom no landscape is so lovely or so precious that it can't be improved by the wheel ruts of a 4-wheel-drive vehicle. Their minds won't be changed by the smug pieties of the only kayaker because he's just as selfish as they are.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor. He is learning to kayak.

US	48778664	R119NQK4SSIDFT	0071413065	818695272	A Speck on the Sea : Epic Voyages in the Most Improbable Vessels	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Improbable Voyages, Enthralling Adventures	By Bill Marsano. William Longyard has assembled a truly delightful collection of nearly six dozen stories of voyages in really deep water by people in ridiculously small--and sometimes just plain ridiculous--boats. Buy it pronto, put it on your nightstand; promise yourself you won't read more than one story per night. OK? (Of course you can always start over.)<br /><br />There is, apparently, no profile that fits these people. Some are desperate, such as the Englishmen held as slavery in Algeria: They made a daring escape in a folding boat they built themselves. (In 1644!) Some are godful folk determined to spread the Holy Word. Some seek fame and others seek love; a few hope to make great heaps of money as profitable novelties. Others have had their adventure gene cross wires with their crackpot gene (an alarming number of them begin with absolutely nautical experience whatsoever). Doesn't matter: Their stories are wonderful and hair-raising.<br /><br />Their craft are various. There's a Jeep and a succession of boats designed to take the record for Atlantic crossing by the world's smallest boat. There are kayaks, canoes, undecked sloops, a mold plug and a pair of water-walking pontoons. There are rowboats, of course, and my only (and very minor) complaint is that Longyard doesn't include the best sardonic nautical quotation I've ever run into: When a couple of British ex-soldiers finally completed their transoceanic row, a reporter asked how they felt at having \\"beaten the Atlantic Ocean.\\" To which one of them replied, \\"We didn't beat the Atlantic. It let us go.\\"<br /><br />Longyard makes up for this with his chapter on Capt. Franz Romer, who kleppered the Atlantic in the 1920s--first man to do it. All these years we've been allowed to believe he took a stock Klepper off the rack, but that is apparently far from the truth.<br /><br />Every reader will have his own favorite amongst these stories; mine is that of Paul Strogis. A Latvian on the run from the Russian army (which wanted to draft him) and the German police (who feared he was a dangerous socialist, or worse), he traveled widely, working his passage, and fetched up in Australia, there to slowly starve as he pined for love until it struck him that he must emigtrate to the U.S., 9000 miles away, in a boat of his own devising.<br /><br />So he set about to learn everything he needed to know to build, sail and navigate a boat from books in the public library. He built his own sextant from scrap hacksaw blades. And then God bless him he set off.<br /><br />There are lots of black-and-white pix here; they're nice and grainy--just vague enough to inspire more madcap dreaming.--Bill Marsano's adventures in his Feathercraft folding kayak have been pretty bloody demure but still sufficient to scare him silly.	2005-01-20

If you were to go to a really well-stocked bookstore and start counting the guidebooks devoted to Paris, there's a fair chance you wouldn't finish on the same day you started. Paris is like the Battle of Gettysburg: Everyone wants to write about it and almost everyone does. (Some more than once.) So while you might consider yourself spoiled for choice, it's more likely that you'll be overwhelmed and baffled.<br /><br />I can help you out here because I'm almost uniquely qualified to judge. I've used guides, written for guides and even sold guides in a travel bookstore. And from that I conclude that this is the best guide to Paris available, bar none.<br /><br />Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls have written literally dozens of guides; I first came to know their work in Italy two decades ago. They lived there at the time just as they are now writing guides to France and live there too. It's fair to say that from depth of experience and local perspective, they can't be beat. They are not quick in-and-outers dependent on what the local tourist office is pushing.<br /><br />Their Paris book has all you'd expect from any decent competitor, of which there are plenty: details and overviews of nightlife, sports, parks, hotels, transport, restaurants, museums, walking tours, festivals, flea markets, shopping. All that and more. What sets it apart--far apart--is the quality and freshness of the writing, which is informed, stylish and witty (the historical notes are especially fine and a delight to read).  The reader truly feels guided  by this book--taken in hand by an expert (two of them in this case) and given the key to the city. This is a genuinely sophisticated approach to the City of Light. A triomphe, in fact.<br /><br />If you're going to Paris for a week or more, you may very well wish to embark upon a daytrip beyond the city. For that you must buy \\"An Hour from Paris,\\" by Annabel Simms (a Brit long resident in Paris). She's a perfect companion to Facaros and Pauls, and almost their equal as a writer. She lists 20 splendid daytrips, most of them little known, all available by public transport, and none more than an hour away.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning travel writer and editor.	2005-01-09

There are more than enough bar guides around to satisfy even the thirstiest soul, so the question becomes which one is the most helpful, the easiest to use. Well, this one has a pretty fair claim to the title.<br /><br />At about 4.5 inches by 9, it is of convenient, under-bar size (no bartender wants the customer to know he has to look anything up). It has some 2,700 recipes, and it takes them all with a straight face, from the utterly genteel to the impossibly vulgar (in my view, anyone who orders a German Leg-Spreader or a Duck Fart is a lout who should be flung into the street at the earliest opportunity, but that's the bouncer's job). There's an enlarged section on the martini, that greatest of cocktails, that Fred Astaire of drinks; and sections on flavored vodkas, shooters, floaters and wines. The wine section is especially worthy of note. Bartenders used to take the approach of Tim Costello's old Manhattan saloon, which had its wine list painted on the wall. It said: \\"Red, $2.50. White, $2.50. No substitutions.\\" But times are changing and with any number of places offering wine by the glass, the able bartender has to know more than how to use a corkscrew. In this book, the wine advice comes from that demigod, Robert Parker Jr. himself. Nuff said.<br /><br />But the best thing about this book is that it has a comb binding--something like a spiral-wire binding, but made of plastic. It means this book, unlike all the others I've see lately, lies FLAT. No more bending the book open, flexing it until the binding cracks, and then weighting it with a beer bottle to keep the thing from flapping closed. Sometimes strokes of genius are as easy as they are rare.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor.'	2004-12-20

Chris Duff's photos, which are bundled together and whacked a little perfunctorily into the middle of this book, limp under the heading of 'snaps.' Duff belongs to the old school of kayakin' shutterbugs: compose any old how, so long as the bow of the boat is in the frame; shoot in any old light; and shoot, sometimes, any old subject. There's a darn nice snap of a Hooker seal here but what I really wanted was more pix of the damage (and later repairs) to his boat from the surf landing that nearly killed him. I'm just saying. (And the maps are even worse--clear, but seldom helpful.)<br /><br />Never mind: This is a book of writing. Duff seems to have had no specific reason to try a 1700-mile circumnavigation of New Zealand's South Island (it's not even a first) but he is no virgin. He's looped the British Isles and then Ireland; he's paddled 8000 miles along the east coast of Canada and the U.S.; even now he may be paddling round Iceland.<br /><br />He, too, gets into a little gauzy mysticism about the Eternal Why and his place in the universe, but most of the time he's a little too busy for that stuff. South Island's coast is a place that goes from bad to worse, and it's instructive to listen in as Duff relates his tactics and strategies for dealing with bad weather and dangerous, even life-threatening situations: You can learn from this stuff as well as be staggered by it. And just for lagniappe there are those occasional moments of perfect weather and following seas that surf him along in solitary joy. These usually come along just after the notoriously perverse Tasman Sea has, as they say south of here, \\"prit-near\\" beaten him to a pulp.<br /><br />A particular pleasure of this book is the human aspect. Despite the solitary aspect of his circumnavigations, Duff is a sociable man who enjoys and appreciates the  people he meets--and appears to bring out the best in them. Add that to the fact that Kiwis are notably kind and generous anyway and you arenot surprised that Duff makes friends everywhere he goes and they bend over backwards to help him in every way they can.<br /><br />Judging from the indications in the text, it's clear that Duff prepared extremely well for this voyage, and readers should pay close attention as they go along, because--probably because this stuff is bred into his bones by now--Duff spends very little time discussing equipment at the end. In fact, he's done with the subject in a single page.<br /><br />There's one incident in this book that commands my admiration and will yours. I don't want to give anything away but at one point Duff receives some help of a rather expensive kind, and his response is to pull out his credit card. \\"No worries, mate,\\" he's told, officialdom is budgeted for that. All very well, but Duff insists on paying his own way. He is well aware of the fact that a well-behaved guest doesn't batten on his hosts.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning editor and writer whose own kayaking voyages fill only pages, not books.	2004-12-03

(The fourth author, Sarah Moodie, is a journalist involved only in the writing end.) The three men write a little about each other and a little more about the trip per se (this is not a text-heavy production), each taking for himself one section of the journey. All in all there's more hard work than drama here, at least partly because their planning (exemplified by an excellent chapter on equipment) precluded the endless death-defying adventures, mishaps and show-off machismo that are all too commonly the stock of books of the into-the-void variety. In short there are some thrills--but no &#60;cheap&#62; thrills. The gang's greatest drama, in fact, comes when they're in someone else's hands, being ferried back to Argentina.<br /><br />The prose is workmanlike and in all there's a rather muted emotional tone here: The paddlers seem to think the voyage is a bit of all right as a fairly extreme male-bonding experience, but clearly no one's actually obsessed with it. To pump the emotional temperature up a bit, Mme. Moodie is dragooned to staple on some sonorous and high-flown prose about the idealism of adventure: how man must needs go a-questing, a-daring the unknown, and how the race needs people test themselves. Jeez: There's even a Mission Statement! Adding this claptrap to a lot of sudden realizations of man's wee-tiny place in the vast universe occasionally made me long for George Mallory's empty-headed (but brief!) explanation of why he wan ted to climb Everest: &#34;Because it's there.&#34;<br /><br />But then there are the photos. Many of them are so perfectly exposed and beautifully composed that they look like studio shots or Sierra Club posters. They make you wonder who carried the 8X10 view cameras--and who lugged Ansel Adams. I'd like to see these shots three times as big and three times as many. They're perfect for winter dreaming by the fire with your feet up and some wine at your elbow. You can stare at them until you fall right into the frame.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning editor and writer whose own kayaking voyages fill only pages, not books.	2004-12-03

Just about every columnist of any kind reaches a point at which he thinks it a fine idea to bundle his columns together and make them into a book. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. A few years ago the novelist Jay MacInerney did that with his wine columns for Vogue magazine and the result was, to my mind, embarrassing. What was on display was, mostly, tedious repetition, little imagination and surprisingly dull writing.<br /><br />Now Alan Richman, award-winning food writer and restaurant critic for the likes of GQ and Food & Wine, has taken the gamble--but this time the result is a winner.<br /><br />Richman is a generous and imaginative soul with an easy, flowing style; he is articulate, not glib; he is funny and drily wittyl he is adventurous, with firm but not savage opinions and prejudices. He's old enough to have a wide frame of reference backed by an excellent memory. And he has the rare gift of being able to take a reader along with him. He makes you feel like a confidant.<br /><br />That makes it unalloyed please to follow his adventures: dining extravagantly for a week with rich wine collectors in France; fumbling his way through two nights as a wine steward at a fancy restaurant; suffering a disatrous dinner with Sharon Stone; driving the coast of North Carolina to gorge himself on his beloved barbecue sandwiches; memorializing that disappearing artifact, the Jewish Waiter. These are but a few of his explorations, and those I haven't mentioned are just as much fun.<br /><br />His prejudices are pointed, openly admitted and neatly expressed. I'm inclined to agree with many of them, including the vexed question of men dining with women and especially the problem of waiters who won't shut up. Indeed, I recently was a guest at Per Se, a notably expensive new restaurant in New York opened by the star of Napa's French Laundry, and I was astonished by the intrusiveness of the service. There were ten of us at table, all engaged in eager conversation--and constantly being told to hush up by our waiter, who insisted on interrupting at every course to describe at length the very dishes that were so clearly described on the menu. I guess that I, like Richman, am of the old school: I think waiters should wait (for a pause), say \\"Excuse me\\"--then put the plate down and scram.<br /><br />A serious failing of this book is that it's so short--but that suggests rigorous selection. Richman has given us only his best here, so reader discipline is required. Read these pleasures one at a time, now matter how tempted to tear through them one after another, or you'll be at the end of the book in no time. On the other hand, you can always start over again.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wine, food and travel.	2004-12-03

By Bill Marsano. Call this the perfect stocking-stuffer for wine buffs. The authors previously wrote the award-winning Vino Italiano: The Regional Wines of Italy, which I also recommend. It's confusing for many that the vast world of Italian wines frays into chaos at times--usually just when you think you've mastered it. Bastianich and Lynch manage to impose some order. The core of the book is the alpahabetical listing of wineries, to which a common-sense approach is applied. Italians are in love with long names. There is a town in Tuscany called San Macario in Piano di Ponte San Pietro; wineries, naturally, are often melodiously decorated with prefixes like Azienda Agricola and Azienda Viticoltura. The authors mercifully list such wineries under the principal part of the name. Thus Azienda Agricola Miani is under the M's. (I hope in future editions they will do the same with the innumerable wineries prefixed with Fattoria, Masseria or Castello.)<br /><br />After you've found the winery you're looking for you also find crisp, accurate information on its wines, with a rough price-guide included.<br /><br />There's lots of other useful stuff here: how to read a label, the meaning of DOC and DOCG, vintage charts and so on, but it's the big list of wineries (which doesn't skimp on Sicily, Sardinia and southern Italy, as some others do) that makes this book an excellent companion every time you head to your local wineshop.--Bill Marsano is an James Beard award winning wine-and-spirits writer.	2004-11-25

An old Italian pastime is the compiling of lists of the 'cento citta'--the hundred most appealing Italian cities and towns. Candidates should be small enough for intimacy but big enough to afford urban pleasures. They needn't be sunk in wilderness but countryside should certainly be at hand. Agreeable climate? Another plus. The lists are always highly personal and endlessly debatable, and here's Paolo Lazzarin, journalist and photographer, with his own nominations. He outdoes tradition by selecting 101 towns, all, per the subtitle, beautiful and small.<br /><br />And all in all, he does a pretty good job; certainly this book will help the Italy-lorn struggle through a long winter of discontent with being too far from the Blessed Peninsula. And, as Jane Austen wrote, or should have, \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that staring at pictures of Italy never did a body any harm.\\" The photos are the principal part and appeal of the book; this is not a survey course (\\"Italy: From the Etruscans to Berlusconi\\"). There is an abundance of them but I could wish more were better and/or better chosen.<br /><br />Some do not illustrate, others do not evoke, and still others are well-worn tourist-office images. For example, here you'll get no hint of what Riva del Garda actually looks like, and still less of Faenza, which is represented only by its famous ceramics. In San Remo, must we see the casino--again? The entry for Valenza has an extended caption about a nature reserve sitting beside a large and ordinary shot of a palazzo's interior staircase.<br /><br />As for the writing, the best I can say is that it avoids the customary excesses; Italians are too often overwhelmed by patrimony and resort to cheerleading in prose form. On the other hand, Lazzarin is mechanical, unspired. It's hard to believe that he's really at one with all these places, even, occasionally, that he has the facts. Shall Trento really be called a hamlet? Is Triora really \\"perched above the sea\\"? (I distinctly recall its being a 10-mile drive inland.) Shouldn't Lazzarin admit that the Cinque Terre's hill paths are terminally overrun by vapid Rick Steves tourists? And there's an overall lack of sophistication: Siena's Piazza del Campo, Lazzarin confides, \\"was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.\\" Believe me, gentle reader, the designation is irrelevant to Siena, that living masterpiece. Its sole value is to validate the pack of overpaid, underworked artsy UN bureaucrats who awarded it. (And still one wonders: 1995? What on earth took them so long?)<br /><br />Still, still--you could do worse. Lazzarin has found his way to plenty of places most Americans have never heard of or have merely passed by: Triora, Ortona (no T, no C; just plain Ortona), Cividale, Sondrio, Anagni and others, and with this book in your lap and some wine at hand, you'll have a good enough time visiting them, and perhaps be inspired to check ticket prices online. If that should happen, then your next step is to get some of the Cadogan Guides to Italy and to Italian regions; they are written by Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls, and they are much the best I've run into. Lucky you: They're all available fromn Amazon, too.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor who has won several awards for his articles. He visits Italy several times a year.	2004-11-25

This book takes me back--how far back I don't want to say, because that was when Sears was respectfully, even reverently referred to as Sears, Roebuck, their sport line was J.C. Higgins and their tool brand was Dunlap. So there is plenty of nostalgia value here, with lots of background on brands familiar or forgotten. There is also plenty of .22 history, particularly on the BB Cap, CB Cap, and development of the Short, Long and Long Rifle cartridges, background of some famous makers, and lots of tips on marksmanship.<br /><br />My quarrel here is with the claim \\"Complete Book.\\" No way; this is more like a beginner's book; fine for a youngster just starting out, or for a duffer like me, who devoted no more study to the .22 than was required to pass the NRA firearms-safety test long years ago. A serious shooter--even a mid-level shooter--who took the claim seriously would be very disappointed, and rightly so.--Bill Marsano grew up as an All-American Boy--i.e., fascinated with guns.	2004-11-25

There are more than enough bar guides around to satisfy even the thirstiest soul, so the question becomes which one is the most helpful, the easiest to use. Well, this one has a pretty fair claim to the title.<br /><br />At about 4.5 inches by 9, it is of convenient, under-bar size (no bartender wants the customer to know he has to look anything up). It has some 2,700 recipes, and it takes them all with a straight face, from the utterly genteel to the impossibly vulgar (in my view, anyone who orders a German Leg-Spreader or a Duck Fart is a lout who should be flung into the street at the earliest opportunity, but that's the bouncer's job). There's an enlarged section on the martini, that greatest of cocktails, that Bogart of drinks; and sections on flavored vodkas, shooters, floaters and wines. The wine section is especially worthy of note. Bartenders used to take the approach of Tim Costello's old Manhattan saloon, which had its wine list painted on the wall. It said: \\"Red, $2.50. White, $2.50. No substitutions.\\" But times are changing and with any number of places offering wine by the glass, the able bartender has to know more than how to use a corkscrew. In this book, the wine advice comes from that demigod, Robert Parker Jr. himself. Nuff said.<br /><br />But the best thing about this book is that it has a comb binding--something like a spiral-wire binding, but made of plastic. It means this book, unlike all the others I've see lately, lies FLAT. No more bending the book open, flexing it until the binding cracks, and then weighting it with a beer bottle to keep the thing from flapping closed. Sometimes strokes of genius are as easy as they are rare.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor.	2004-11-12

La Capitaine Hill, or Cap'n Kate, as I think of her, is a sailor, cook and blessed soul who lives a life to die for. She spends much of her year in Gascony, in the southwest of France, and she lives in a place she calls the Long Village. By that she means the Canal Lateral a la Garonne, which winds through some of the prettiest parts of France as it makes its way to (or from) the river Garonne, which in turn meets the Atlantic just beyond Bordeaux. She manages to do this because about 17 years ago she had the good sense to buy the Julia Hoyt, a<br /><br /> or canal boat to live, cook and teach aboard.<br /><br />This delightful and envy-prompting book is the fruit of her years in the Long Village, collecting recipes, meeting people, making friends, exploring odd corners and traditions and folkways. Buying tomatoes from the lockkeeper's wife; getting caught--by a 12-year-old boy!--in the ghastly act of serving cheese &#60;before&#62; the meal; learning from an elderly &#60;grand-mere&#62; that a freshly killed rabbit must 'rest' for a day before it's cooked; finding a pear-grower turned part-poet/distiller; discovering the potion 'served on wedding nights to fortify the newlyweds'; and more and more and more.<br /><br />Of course there are recipes; recipes by the penich-load. Cap'n Kate's are the dishes of Gascony, of course, and Gascony is that romantic landscape of Cyrano de Bergerac and d'Artagnan. If she can cook any and all of them in the tiny galley of the Julia Hoyt, then we ought to be able to cook them too.<br /><br />A good strategy would be to buy two copies of this book--one for the kitchen and the other for the night table, to prompt sweeet dreams. Another good bet is to book a cooking vacation cruise, to plod placidly through the Long Village with the good Captain at the helm or the stove, as circumstances require. A quick e-mail to kate@thefrenchkitchen.com should do the trick, me hearties!--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wine, spirits, food and travel.	2004-10-25

This comes as a necessary tonic after years of fake-Italy books. Under the Tuscan Sun was charming until Frances Mayes began strip-mining Italy as if it were her personal franchise. A couple of cheap little books cashed in on her fame; then a PBS series (always the kiss of death to authenticity) and after that, the major motion picture, in itself blessed by bearing no resemblance to her book. Now she's shamelessly stooped to Tuscan-decor-for-your-home. Elsewhere there's ritualized 'roots' sagas, such as Mark Rotella's gag-inducing Stolen Figs, and pseudo-intellectualizations of similarly emetic effect (Francine Prose's Sicilian Odyssey takes the cake here, and with only a little effort would make a satiric comedy).<br /><br />Now here at last the Italians have their say, or one Italian does, anyway. And that's enough, because even though he's never malicious, the tourists who descend on Italy in general and guide Dario Castagno in particvular are embarrassing and even humilitating.<br /><br />Castagno was reared in England and so speaks the language as a native, but when he returned to Italy as you young man that didn't do him much good for some time. W<br /><br />jhat will surprise many here is that he spent several years working at a very ordinary winery job before setting up as a guide. That's becauser it's only over the past couple of decades that Tuscany (the actual place) has become TUSCANY! the illusory media darling.<br /><br />When he does start out he meets more than his share of perfectly appalling tourists. There are the overdressed (spike heels in the vineyards), the bullying, the utterly ignorant (one of whom expects to tour Chianti in the morning and shop in the Veneto on the same day), the self-deluded (a couple of superbly outfitted health fanatics whose ability to walk deserts them in Hour One) and the utterly clueless (a fellow who buys a valuable antique coin dated \\"42 B.C.\\").<br /><br />Of course not all are that bad; it's onlythe egregious that are amusing to read about. But there are certainly more than enough of those. They'll make us mind our manners--I hope--the nect time we go abroad.<br /><br />Interspersed with these misadventures is a goodly view of Castagno's personal history and glimpses of the Tuscany that has disappeared beneath the veneer of modern tourism. It's enough to make me wish I hadn't missed the boat--but at the same time, back there there was hardly a decent hotel or restaurant to be found.--Writer and editor Bill Marsano has been visiting relatives and winemakers in Italy three or four times a year since the 1980s.	2004-10-24

The former are beloved of the earth and destined for long lives of success, achievement and public acclaim. The latert are a friendless lot doomed to become social lepers unless, that is, they buy this book and follow it with religious zeal. Then they'll be OK.<br /><br />The problem is that parties are almost always lots of fun until you begin to think about giving your own, and then they seem daunting, even terrifying. Well, OK; they're not something you can just toss off, but it you let La Lenkert be your guide, you will succeed. Just keep in the front of your mind her infectious motto: Support Wild Life--Throw a Party.<br /><br />Parties take modest amounts of care, planning, attention and oprganization. Lenkert takes the approach of organizing YOU by giving you the straight dope in an organized, encouraging and (best of all) brief manner. She knows about music and mannders, drinks and desserts, recipes (there are plenty here, all simple and sure-fire) and supplies.<br /><br />In the end, this is really a primer for the festivity-challenged. They'll use it for maybe two or three soirees and then spread their wings. Or maybe not. Either way, they'll have freedom or dependence for about the price of a movie. Their friends will be amazed, and they'll be thrilled with themselves. --Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-10-24

It was Dean Swift who memorably apologized for writing a long letter because &#34;I haven't the wit to write a short one.&#34; That's not a problem with this book, whose 89 pages prove that brevity isn't always the soul of wit and prompt the question: How can the anyone miss a target the size of France? Even apart from recent unpleasantness over Iraq, France is a tempting target. The French are rule-bound, convinced of their country's superiority (while always complaining and frequently striking), and always patting themselves on the back for their splendidly civilized way of life (but last summer leaving 15,000 of their elderly relatives to die unattended at home during a heat wave). A perverse people, the French. Give 'em grapes and silk and they'll make wines and gowns that'll knock you flat. Give 'em sheet metal and they make cars that resemble vacuum cleaners. They think Napoleon was a hero.<br /><br />In short, it's easy to spoof the French; you can make valid points and needn't be nasty about it either. So why can't Dale Gershman even lay a glove on them? She's strident, broad and off target even though she's lived there nearly 20 years, thus adding a factual basis to the old phrase &#34;can't hit the side of a barn &#60;from the inside.&#62;&#34; She's so desperate to be politically incorrect that she ends up a ranting loudmouth.<br /><br />Did I say 89 pages? Well, subtract about 15 for some photos (all apparently taken the same day, mostly of the same person) that are almost uniquely un-illustrative. Then subtract about 8 more pages of blank space. What's left isn't much more than a magazine article. Gershman writes often in ALL CAPS, repeats herself frequently, uses lots of exclamation points! and interrupts herself with lots of parenthetical asides. She practices a 'smart-mouth' prose style, as in 'kinda' for 'kind of' and writin' gerunds without usin' the 'g' on the end, which she thinks is kinda funny (and is certain you're gonna think so too). Mostly she seems to be shouting. All in all, Gershman sounds like someone who learned English by watching television.<br /><br />I will give a sample of her wit. Her chapter on politeness begins with a half page or so of franctic wondering where 'it' is. Could 'it' be here? Or there? Where should 'it' be? Maybe 'it' is in this place? Maybe that? All in all, a good impression of a neurotic in search of lost car keys. After listing numerous possible places (including on the person of Gerard Depardieu) that 'it' might be found, she commits the following:<br /><br />&#34;But no matter how reasonable those possibilities seem it didn't take me long to remember that it's at least two thousand years old and even though Planet Hollywood is looking a bit worse for wear (to say nothing of Monsieur Depardieu), there's certainly a big difference between a hundred generations and a half a decade so I discarded the conundrum theory altogether and just as I was wracking my brain trying to come up with another likely place it hit me total 'Eureka!'-style that it probably wasn't in one place at all--or, put it this way: the &#60;original&#62;, yeah, is in &#60;one&#62; place but it no longer was necessary trying to figure out where that one place is because it suddenly became joltingly obvious that a thousand years ago every monk in the country was drafted into service to make a copy of it for every family in the country which would pass it from descendant to descendant like the family bible but off [sic] course this is inestimably more sacred which is why I'm having so much trouble unearthing one because otherwise it'd be out there on the diningroom table or on the nightstand or at least in the top drawer of the armoire where the linens are kept.&#34;<br /><br />That's 213 words--and a fair sample of the book as a whole. It is followed by about 600s words more in the same vein, and only then is the punch line revealed: 'It' is what Gershman calls the &#34;Secret French-Politeness Code,&#34; which she doesn't understand. (Anyone rolling in the aisles is urged to pull himself together and ordery this book right away.)<br /><br />So it's not a book and it's not a magazine article. Maybe it could be broken into segments for presentation at a comedy club where the audience does a lot of drinking.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor who likes and dislikes the French as much as anyone else.

Amazingly, it is, and at such times one may long for a brief escape, a short trip into the countryside. To the rescue comes Annabel, a Briton long resident in Paris who has obviously felt the same uneasy stirrings, because she has compiled a very attractive assortment of little breakaways, none of which takes more than an hour to reach, and deftly compressed them into her small but very useful pocket-sized book.<br /><br />She's assembled--and thoroughly researched twenty daytrips, and most of them are bound to surprise even veteran Paris habitues. There's a thrice-moated town to the east, a cathedral in an ex-chocolate factory, canalside walks, and an huddle of peaceful islands at the end of a Metro lines. (And at the end she also throws in Versailles, Giverny and the like, just for lagniappe.)<br /><br />Simms knows the territory very well; she writes briskly and supplies history, background  and local lore as well as specifics on finding the tourist offices, restaurants and museums at each stop. There are good photos and maps, too. Being British, she also includes numerous walking tours, and being a walker myself, I liked that best of all.<br /><br />All of these destinations are accessible by public transport, for which Simms gives excellent details. (All too often, a concierge or tourist office in Paris will reflexively urge you to rent a car.)<br /><br />I stumbled upon this book while in Paris last month, and the daytrip I took was a hghlight of my visit. If you're planning to visit Paris, get this book before you go--you'll want to build at least one of Simms's recommendations into your itinerary.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning American travel writer.	2004-10-03

Only a couple of decades such a book would cover the bare bones of American cooking, throw in a lot of French and a little Italian, and that would be that. These days we have a few extra cuisines to deal with-- Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Middle Eastern, Mexican--and at the same time the old America-French-Italian triad must needs be treated in greater depth.<br /><br />So granting that the task is physically impossible (even could such a book be assembled, no one could pick it up without a forklift), it must be admitted that Rolland has done a terrific job. He not only explains, defines and identifies without letup or surcease for more than 400 pages, he does it briskly and informatively: What he tells you will stick with you. And he lards his definitions with lore and tradition as well. In all, this book is not only useful but entertaining, which is what food itself should be. There are good black-and-white illustrations (drawings, not photos), and too bad there aren't more of them. Still, this book is a pleasure just to dip into now and then for a quick \\"snack,\\" and it belongs on the nightstand as well as in the kitchen.

So far as publishers are concerned, they ain't over till they're over. I speak of (and they profit from) World War II and the Age of Fighting Sail. The former recently gave us \\"The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,\\" a fine (and rare) account of our Navy's noblest victory; now the latter brings us  \\"Patrick O'Brian's Navy\\"--which is not, please note, just for O'Brian fans.<br /><br />All in all the book does an excellent job of conveying the context--from the British side--of the Royal Navy during its years of near-constant war with the French. It's large in format, heavily and handsomely illustrated with contemporary paintings, engravings, watercolors and cartoons as well as modern diagrams and maps. All are generously displayed. The text sometimes struggles to work its way around them, especially as there are frequent over-sized quotations and framed text blocks (\\"sidebars\\" containing abstracts from contemporary diaries and news reports) that occupy their own spaces.<br /><br />Battle coverage is terrific. The Royal Navy's great triumphs are well detailed, as are several notable if not-so-well-known small actions, chosen for their display of aubreyesque daring and dash. And Lord Cochrane, one of the primary inspirations for Aubrey, gets extensive copverage all by his heroic self. The Royal Navy's internal world is also very nicely explored--ratings and ranks; manning and management (and mismanagement: mutinies are included); rigs and rigging, and--just when we run out of Frenchmen, pirates and slavers.<br /><br />Organization is something of a problem. There's a tendency, once an picture-heavy design is established, for the text to be straitjacketed, for subjects be treated equally but inadequately, because the designers allot them just so much room and no more, and the text must be squeezed or cut to fit. Here, for example, gunnery has so little space that we get but a glance at the 32-pounder and never hear of carronades until another section many pages later. As a result, weaponry is merely sketched. Likewise with that frequent O'Brian phenomenon, the \\"weather gauge\\"--not well explained, and divided between two sections. Medicine at sea? Considering the importance of Stephen Maturin in the O'Brian series, it's almost ignored.<br /><br />The book doesn't explain, and none can, the incredible fighting spirit of the British sailor, be he Jack Tar or Dick Nastyface. They were badly paid, ill fed and worse housed; they got little respect ashore or afloat; they risked death for mutiny and yet in the middle of a mutiny rallied round so soon as the French poked a masthead above the horizon--and then they'd beat the tar out of them more often than not.<br /><br />Best thing to do is read this book through and then re-read the Aubrey-Maturin series all over again.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor, and a generally boatful person.	2004-08-12

What a jolly season for word-lovers this is, what with Lynn Truss's &quot;Eats, Shoots, and Leaves&quot; and this book by Bill Walsh coming along neck-and-neck and cheek-by-jowl. Walsh, who is the copy chief of the Washington Post, has written a far broader work than Truss's, with punctuation just one of the things covered (and usually very well covered). There's also grammar here and more important there is style.<br /><br /> The author of such a book sets himself up, always. Many readers will assume or claim that he's preaching perfection and will therefore fall upon tiny errors yelling nyah-nyah in spiteful disvalidation of his whole work, of his very right to speak at all. Sorry but, admirable as it may be, prefection eludes and always will (Lynn Truss's first error is in her subtitle!). Mark Twain said, of perfection in English grammar, &quot;the thing just can't be done.&quot; So let's be willing to give a little, and even accept the odd contradiction.<br /><br /> That done, we find a pretty useful guide. It's mostly newspaper-oriented, but it's still a help to the ordinary writer and ordinary person struggling to commit a sentence and finding between the opening capital and the closing period a morass of weird plurals, nightmare collectives, number-of-the-verb, stylistic conventions, punctuational deadfalls and a lot of other horrors that make not ending with a preposition a treat (which taboo is, by the way, nonsense, as Walsh neatly explains). Walsh deals with most problems briskly and helpfully, and if you keep this book ever close to your heart it won't be long before you can toss off elegant vanity plates, bumperstickers and ransom notes without so much as a by-your-leave. And you will begin to enjoy doing so, because you won't be scared out of your wits half the time. (Most people dread writing as they dread public speaking.)<br /><br /> I am generally dubious of copy editors; I consider them a species of vermin that should be hunted for sport. But I will go a long way with Walsh because he clearly thinks about the language and tries to make intelligent, workable decisions that help reader and writer alike. (Most copy editors simply trot out their pet peeves and hobby-horses, salt with ignorance and prejudice, and then damage the writer's copy, the hideous effects invisible until the crime appears in print.)<br /><br /> I will unyieldingly dispute with him on two points, however. First, (free-lance) writers should absolutely not waste any time studying client magazines to learn their style. Magazines routinely pay writers poorly and abuse them in general; if they want their stylebooks followed, let the editors do some work for a change. (Editors don't have jobs. They have lunch.) Second, what's this foolishness about a ship being referred to as &quot;it&quot;?<br /><br /> That's an example of what offends me most about copy editors: their char-woman's mentality. Always trying to neaten up; emptying the ashtray every time the ash hits the glass; making you move so they can plump up the pillows. Busy, busy, busy! The net result of all this is damage to a language of which varioty is its chiefest glory. Referring to ships as feminine is a tradition many centuries old: it goes back to the Romans; it is established and understood; it is not to be dismissed by some petty tyrant with an itchy pencil. Maybe it's a question of political correctness. Maybe someone is pained because it excludes an entire sex (the male, I believe). Frankly I'm disinclined to believe that this will cause little boys everywhere to be discouranged from becoming ocean liners, but copy editors might very well fall for that.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-08-01

The steel battleship, that most splendid of boy's toys, so beloved of admirals and the public too, had an amazingly short lifetime. From the Royal Navy's Dreadnought of 1906 to their ultimate expression in World War II, battleships lived a mere forty years. World War II brought Germany's splendid Bismarck, Japan's Yamato and Musashi, and several American classes, the best of them being the mighty Iowas.<br /><br /> But it also brought naval aviation, so that for most of the war the magnificent giants were dinosaurs, often reduced to shore bombardments. Hood vs. Bismarck, after all, lasted but three salvos; Bismarck vs. Rest of Royal Navy was hardly a match; and Japan's godzillas fell to naval aviation. The only big-gun fleet action of the war was, I think, 1944's Battle of Surigao Strait, a reasonably satisfactory demolition derby between Nishimura of Japan's Force C and our Navy's reincarnated Pearl Harbor survivors.<br /><br /> So battleships had only World War I in which to show their stuff. Robert K. Massie's big, rich, Omaha-steak of a book tells us all about it.<br /><br /> Much of this war has long since faded to sound bites; at sea we get the Lusitania, submarines and a spoonful of Jutland, and that's about it. Fans of naval rifles, mines and torpedoes get get much more than that from Massie. The author of &quot;Dreadnought,&quot; he knows tactics and strategy, facts and figures, winners and losers. He also knows--is master of--detail and anecdote. In his telling these distant events have the smell of cordite and remote personages come alive on their quarterdecks (and behind their desks).<br /><br /> Garmany's High Seas Fleet was markedly smaller than the Royal Navy, but it had better ships, shells and shooting. Still, the Royal Navy had its great tradition, fighting spirit and confidence in victory while the Germans were often crippled by caution. Massie is superb at showing how the Germans finally lost and the British clumsily won.<br /><br /> Minor events and major are all here, coherently presented. There are Coronel and Falklands; Dogger Bank and Battle of the Bight; the Scarborough Raid (Germans shelling beach resorts); the submarine war; and of course that mighty set-piece, Jutland. There the German High Seas Fleet won the silver medal tactically, giving a real smacking to the Brits, who nevertheless took the gold: At the end, the Royal Navy ruled the waves and the Germans had to run for their lives. (Oddly, it was an American newspaper that best summed-up Jutland, saying &quot;The German fleet has assaulted its jailer but it is still in jail.&quot;)<br /><br /> Massie is especially good on the allies' attempt to force the Dardanelles with a fleet of battleships that would then steam up to Istanbul and shell Turkey out of the war. Ships usually come out second-best against fortresses, which don't sink, but here the risk was thought worthwhile: Most of the battleships involved were elderly and due for scrapping anyway. In fact the early stages went well for the allied armada, but when things began to go wrong, the allies were suddenly averse to risking their floating antiques, and the Turks managed to make them quit. (Later, embarrassment led to catastrophe: Gallipoli)<br /><br /> The principal characters, vividly sketched, are Churchill, blundering toward political oblivion, and two admirals. One was John Jellicoe, &quot;inventor&quot; of the dreadnought or modern battleship. A cautious but decisive commander, he trained his fleet well and never used it rashly. He understood that so long as the Grand Fleet remained intact, Germany could never break the allies' strangling blockade. And although the Germans escaped at Jutland, Jellicoe did them terrific damage. The other admiral was David Beatty, head of the battlecruiser squadron. He was brave, dashing, good-looking and outgoing--just the sort of hero the media loves.<br /><br /> Unfortunately he was also a relentless self-promoter, a jealous back-stabber and a bloody fool to boot. At the opening of Jutland he attacked at top speed, leaving his slightly slower but more heavily armed battleships behind, and his gunnery was poor, so his command was savaged by the outnumbered but hard-shooting Germans. Beatty wasn't the only fool involved. Ashore, the Admiralty bungled their intelligence work; afloat, rear elements of the Grand Fleet saw German units escaping--but didn't report to higher command, thinking someone else surely would.<br /><br /> No, not the only fool, Beatty, but surely the worst. The British public was disappointed by Jutland; they wanted a Trafalgar and, failing, that, a scapegoat. Beatty made sure they got one--Jellicoe--whom he and the press blamed for letting the Germans get away.<br /><br /> By two copies of this book so you can give one to a friend.

Years ago, in the slim hope of making myself useful on a certain magazine, I often volunteered to edit Mimi Sheraton's column. She was counted a tough cookie by the other editors, who preferred saps. My stock did in fact rise through self-sacrifice, and so did my free time, for the fact was her column was a breeze.<br />Of course, if an editor mucked around with her copy (and that, I can say without exposing any trade secrets, is what editors generally do), then it wasn't a breeze. So after reading her tight-knit prose, her well-reasoned judgments, her lucid thoughts, I'd call her about a couple of minor points and we'd agree on changing or not in about ten minutes. Then, with my door shut and no one in any case daring to approach Sheraton Control, I had the afternoon free. (Later, when other editors asked how it had gone, I just rolled my eyes.)<br />Keys to Sheraton's style were sticking to the subject and not showing off. Her judgments were measured, not designed to become sound bites; the meal was the star, not the reviewer. Here she does write about (among many other things) herself, and what an interesting self she turns out to be. She covers a lot of ground, including childhood before the war (i.e., World War II); college-girl adventures in New York City (especially funny: her story of breaking up with a civilian boyfriend while being attached to two other guys in the armed services); early work in home-furnishings journalism; plunging into food writing through a passion for travel; her ups and downs as a nationally known food critic for the New York Times (and other publications) and her attempts at improving what professionals call &quot;volume feedings and mass management&quot; and the rest of us call jail, airline, school and hospital food.<br />Sheraton has a fine line in dry wit and is always informative: Most readers will learn some surprising things about restaurants and reviewing. She lists the 20 most-asked quiestion and answers every one, and provides a good idea of the pressures applied to a critic by big-name restaurateurs--and by people who think they're critics just because they run a newspaper. (Odd--but I don't think the Times has reviewed her book. Odd.) But she isn't dishy. Anyone looking here for gossip, innuendo and the settling of scores has come to the wrong place. Sheraton conquers but she does not stoop.<br />And she does it all in 240 pages. One reason is that she writes tightly and tartly. (At least one other well-known &quot;foodie&quot; has published two books, totaling nearly 600 pages, and isn't finished yet.) Another is that she speaks often of wonderful dishes but gives no recipes. Good for her. Recipes are turning up in lots of places they don't really belong these days, including mysteries and popular novels. I usually suspect that means the author hasn't really got the goods, and knows it, and hopes I won't notice. (For much the same reason I resist nutritional puns traditional in this sort of review. I refuse to call this a &quot;bubbling bouillaisse of a book.&quot;) The only time she comes close to such nonsense is with her brisk instructions (maybe a dozen words?) for how to make a Jewish chicken--or a chicken Jewish.<br />Sheraton's 240 pages go rattling by--there's no padding--and because even now I read as an editor, I ticked a few things: I disagree with her use of &quot;ascribe&quot; and &quot;masterful,&quot; and former New York City Mayor John Lindsay would, if he could, on personal orthography. Once where she says Michelin I'm almost certain she means Gault-Millau, but that's about it. (Come to think of it, where was the copy editor?) In all, the experience was like those long-gone magazine days: great reading and effortless, too.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-07-16

This literate and literary book is an eccentric pleasure filled with sly fun and effortless surprise. Paul Collins was born in Pennsylvania to British immigrants, and the greatest of his inheritances is rootlessness: He has changed addresses as often as underwear and only now that he and his wife, Jennifer, have an infant son does he think to settle permanently.<br />Collins is a writer and also a lover of books. For him abandoning San Francisco is an easy choice because it's too expensive and because his neighbors, in their painstakingly restored Victorian houses, apparently never read. &quot;All those beautiful built-in bookshelves?&quot; Collins says. &quot;They don't hold any books.&quot; Indeed his real-estate agent tells him &quot;You have too many books in here. Home buyers don't like books . . . . Really. You should hide them.&quot;<br />So off they go to Wales, to the famous &quot;book town&quot; of Hay-on-Wye, to buy a house. Collins and wife investigate numerous houses in numerous neighborhoods (my favorite is Cusop Dingle), learn some scary things about British real-estate practices, and commence knitting themselves into the fabric of the community. Collins threads together many incidents and a few adventures; truth to tell, some are but flimsily connected to his narrative. On the other hand, he tells them so well, in such witty and inventive prose, that it hardly matters. It is a delight to hear Collins' explain that you CAN tell a book by its cover; his discussions of some of the wondrously strange forgotten books he's collected (&quot;Hunting Indians in a Taxicab&quot; is one of the best titles; I wonder how he missed &quot;By Horse and Sledge to Outcast Siberian Lepers&quot;?); and listen in on his new career as the &quot;American expert&quot; for Richard Booth, the reelingly eccentric anarchist-genius who made sleepy Hay a used-book capital (and also declared himself king of a secessionist republic and began issuing passports).<br />I say &quot;hear&quot; because you don't merely read this book: You hear it; it's as if Collins is talking to you directly, because there is that rare quality called &quot;voice&quot; in his writing. If you love real writing or know someone who does, buy this book right away.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-07-15

Can you see yourself reading a couple of hundred pages about the nation's best-known restaurant and restaurateur? Yes, it's all a form of glorified gossip, but if you're interested in the food world and a ton of big names for lagniappe, then you will have a lot of fun here.<br />Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque is a pretty good story-teller to begin with and he has the able assistance of Peter J. Elliott. The two combine in the early chapters to give an affecting account of Sirio's early life in wartime and postwar Italy (\\"we lived, we farmed, we got arrested\\") and then move neatly into his years of building a career, enslaving himself on passenger liners on the high seas and tony restaurants in Paris, New York and elsewhere.<br />Once he gets to Manhattan things begin to pop and the only fair thing to do is set down some of the notables who talk and/or are talked about in these pages. Stars? Siro's got 'em\\": Yves Montand, Lauren Bacall, The Burtons (\\"they came--but just to fight\\"), the Windsors, Sinatra, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford. Peter Duchin, Claudette Colbert, Gina Lollobrigida, Sophia Loren--my what a bunch of clods our present-day stars seem to be by comparison (Britney? J.Lo? Please!). Amonmg princes and politicos there are the Reagans, Nixon, Ford, most Kennedys, Juan Carlos of Spain, King Umberto of Italy, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Princess Grace . . . Glitterati: Mrs. Wm. F. Buckley, Babe Paley, Jackie O., Lee Radziwill. Writers: Colman Andrews, James Villas, Michael Batterberry, Truman Capote, Leonard Lyons, Cindy Adams, Liz Smith, Gael Greene, Bryan Miller, Craig Claiborne, Pierre Franey, Julia Child. And more. Many more.<br />Ho-hum is what I thought when I picked this up, but it proved me wrong. It's fun.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-06-12
US	48778664	R11HECQBLL31EL	1592400876	436381860	Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation	Books	5	9	12	N	N	Pure Pleasure--and Helpful Instruction	By Bill Marsano. This charming and useful little (209 pages) book, a surprise best-seller in England, offers short, clear, effective instruction for those who have trouble with punctuation--and a great deal of fun (I laughed out loud at least four times) for those who don't<br /><br />Lynne Truss sneakily addresses the former by way of the latter. She gives the punctuation-abled a lot of laughs at the expense of the punctuation-challenged, quoting signs, instructions and other items that can seem ridiculous--and even have their meanings made obscure or ridiculous--by poor punctuation. She's not mean-spirited about it, but she is pretty clear that although correct punctuation is something many people happily live without, not knowing how to handle apostrophes and commas and a handful of other simple marks is akin to lacking other basic but non-critical skills, such as tying shoelaces and telling time on a clock that has hands instead of digits.<br /><br />Besides--the instructions and explanations take up only about half the book, so now you're down to only about 100 pages. And the pages are small, too. Don't tell me you can't handle this.<br /><br />As for the rest, it's history and anecdote loosely wrapped in light-hearted prose. Truss is British and so is her book, so there will be a few references and locutions that give pause to Americans, but none I think are truly impenetrable. She has delightful stories about famous writers warring over punctuation: George Bernard Shaw hectoring Lawrence of Arabia, for example, and Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, at odds with James Thurber. My favorite chapter is on the semicolon, which is also my favorite punctuation mark. Truss quotes Gertrude Stein, who hated both comma (she called it &quot;servile&quot;) and semicolon: &quot;They [semicolons] are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them thecomma nature.&quot; I have to hand it to Stein: She did a beautiful job of expressing her loathing and she did it with nothing more than the bare minimum: a pair of periods.<br /><br />I advise reading only one chapter a day, and for two reasons. First, Truss's prose style is occasionally too rich by half (and sometimes ungrammatical). Second, there are only seven chapters, and if you get as much pleasure out of this book as I did, you'll want to make it last.--Bill Marsano, a professional writer and editor, is a devotee of the suspensive hyphen.	2004-05-10

Women protest against our culture's impossible standards of physical beauty but refuse to rebel against the women's magazines that promote and profit from them. The May issue of Vogue has Nicole Kidman on the cover yet again. Inside: 12 pages of photos in which she says not a word. Beauty is &lt;that&gt; important to Vogue. Now read the cover credits on page 42: &quot;Actress Nicole Kidman in a Christian Lacroix Haute Couture oyster satin sheath dress. Lorraine Schwartz black-gold-and-diamond earrings. Munnu 18K-gold-and-silver double-strand diamond necklace. Fred Leighton 19th-century diamond flower brooch. Daniel Storto gloves. Makeup: Double Perfection Compact Matte Reflecting Powder Makeup SPF 10, Hydrabase Lipstick in Energy, Quarda Eye Shadow in Blue Notes, Precision Eye Deliner in Blue Jean, Instant Lash Mascara in Black, all by Chanel. Hair, Julien d'Ys; makeup, Stephane Marais for Cle de Beau Beaute . . . . Fashion Editor: Phyllis Posnik. Photographer: Irving Penn.&quot; With all that, &lt;anybody&gt; is going to be a knockout.<br />If that doesn't convince you something's fishy, maybe Myrna Blyth can. She was top kick at Ladies Home Journal for 20 years or so and founding editor of More (for &quot;older&quot; women), and now, plagued with guilt, fesses up to decades of exploiting her readers. What she and her media &quot;sisters&quot; did and do is tyrranize and terrorize women: shape their politics by uncritically pushing a liberal-left agenda; foster health scares; frighten them about their physical safety; bemoan stress; harp relentlessly about their looks and weight. The result is a media culture in which someone like Zoe Baird, Clinton's failed nominee for Attorney General, was painted as desperate and sympathetic, despite her hiring two illegal aliens as housekeeper/nannies (for a $11,000 a year!) and skipping tax and social-security payments. You have to admire the chutzpah--not Baird's but the media's. How desperate could Baird andher husband have been on a combined income of more than $800,000 a year?<br />The magazines' solution to almost all problems, Blyth says, is simple: Spend More Money. The goverment must spend more tax money on endless new &quot;programs&quot; for this and for that. Readers must spend more money on self-indulgent shopping and relaxing (sorry! I mean &quot;stress relief&quot;!). It will be noticed that a lot of the self-indulgent solutions are represented by four-color ads in the magazines.<br />Which woman are these magazines really interested in: the poverty-line single mom with two kids struggling with two dead-end jobs out in Podunk? Or the one who has two kids in private school, a supportive husband, a fabulous job, high income with lush benefits, help that at the very least means a nanny and may include a maid and a car service--and &lt;still&gt; complains about stress? Myrna gives a hint: It might be the one who can afford Jimmy Choo shoes, spa visits that cost $600 a day, and long, long baths enhanced by $25 L'Occitane lotions and $30 &quot;aromatherapy&quot; candles.<br />She fills us in on more--greedy, exploitive, hypocritical celebrities whose media appearances come at a price, both in dollars and editorial integrity, and she notes that those who disagrees with the magazines' political agendas are just not going to be heard from. You go along to get along in the women's mag world, or you do not get a byline.<br />Then there's photo fakery. It's amazing what can be done with artful lighting and shadowing, and if those don't suffice, digitized photos can be manipulated endlessly. (The most famous photo faker was recently profiled in the New York Times.) One reported example: Some years ago Cindy Crawford was posing for Vogue, in a bikini that had lots of straps going in all directions, and one of them was esthetically at odds with her belly button--which was ditigially removed. Yes--her belly button! No wonder Crawford is quoted as having said &quot;Even Idon't look like Cindy Crawford.&quot;<br />She doesn't spend much time on the most cynical of these magazines scams, which I call the Take-Back. First they remorselessly hype the latest fad breakthrough, running glowing stories month after month. Then, when the fad begins to die, they back off with second thoughts. Remember what happened to Quality Time? Well, now it's happening to Botox. Great Cure-All! Everybody's Doing It! You Deserve to Look Younger! Anybody Can! And now, in the same issue of Vogue, there's an article saying maybe Botox isn't such a good idea after all!<br />Blyth unpretentious, workmanlike prose is clear and brisk, and in the end her has but two flaws. One is that it won't change any minds. Like Bermuda Triangle fanatics, women's magazine addicts can't change. Their delusion means too much to them. The other is the unpleasant odor hanging about Ms. Blyth, who fed profitably at the same trough as her media sisters for twenty years and has been well paid for this book as well. She's as guilty as the rest. She broke no laws but she betrayed her readers, inflicting utterly unnecessary emotional pain, confusion and doubt--for a paycheck. I'm sure she expects to be forgiven.--Bill Marsano is a professional writers and editor.	2004-05-05
US	48778664	RKGP45J0BZZCZ	0743251520	365915626	Walking to Vermont: From Times Square into the Green Mountains -- a Homeward Adventure	Books	2	19	43	N	N	A Plodder Slogs Uphill	By Bill Marsano. I wanted to like this book. I too am a walker, enlisted in the non-combat infantry. Of a proximate age to Wren, I walk all over Manhattan, weekly crossing the Brooklyn Bridge just for breakfast; I have walked in Tuscany and Liguria and on Cornwall's windy, sea-banged coast.<br /><br />But this is not a book about walking, however much one-foot-in-front-of-the-othering occurs therein. It is about the change of life called retirement, and it is rooted in denial.<br /><br />The author, age 65, has retired as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times. He refuses to be a retiree who can't let go, who hangs around to see &quot;how things are going at the office.&quot; So far, so good; but I really got no clear idea of his plans other than to &quot;walk into retirement&quot; in that prissiest of New England states, Vermont. That's the one where faux-rustics think the NEW L.L. Bean is the REAL L.L. Bean. (And thank heaven for SUVs, hey?)<br /><br />Wren's denial is of his age: 65. He doesn't rant and moan about it but he does intrude it at times and in ways that hit the floor like a brick. When he's grateful, for example, that younger hikers don't notice or at least mention his age, I'm embarrassed for him. A tone of defeat creeps in each time, when in fact some hint of triumph is deserved. It is not nothing, after all, to walk at the age of 65 some 400 miles from Times Square and up the Appalachian Trail, even if the destination is Vermont. It is an accomplishment at any age.<br /><br />Denial damages his walk. He's out of shape, but won't exercise. He has a bad knee, but ignores it; for his arthritic ankle he buys a doctor-prescribed ankle brace ($80!) but leaves it in his pack unused, despite frequent pain. Now about that pack. It weighs 50 pounds! Wren takes far too long to realize that's far too much and even longer to do anything about it. And when a tick bite hints at Lyme disease, Wren dabs it with suntan lotion. That's not brave. It's dumb.<br/><br />Despite some amusing or informative incidents, Wren's storytelling shows just how retired he and his reportorial curiosity are. He starts themes but doesn't finish them: &quot;Yes, there are bears in the woods, but you don't need to meet them.&quot; (So . . . ?) What will the ex-marine he meets do in civilian life? &quot;Go into the family business, sir.&quot; (Which is?) Readers seeking compensating tales of foreign-correspondent life will regret it. Wren has too many, most relentlessly dull and clumsily introduced: &quot;Stretching back against the rock . . . . I sought out the Big Dipper . . . . These were the same glorious constellations I had studied one night in the Ogaden desert of Ethiopia, out with a band of guerrillas who were at war with the government.&quot; Then it gets worse. Much worse.<br /><br />Wren convincingly paints the Appalachian Trail as a rather unpleasant experience. Even the young hikers he meets are usually dirty, smelly and exhausted. They use pseudonyms called 'trail names' and don't talk much: Some are social misfits or running from personal troubles, others are just too tired. One is so used up he eats uncooked oatmeal. The worst of Wren's fellow travelers talks too much, however; that would be America's original smug bore, Henry David Thoreau. In a real failure of imagination, Wren lugs some Thoreau along and frequently shares its dead weight with poor us, apparently unaware that this Waldensian faker was a freeloader always running home for a hot lunch cooked by mommy. Quoting him is prima facie evidence of having too little respect for your audience. Just remember this much: When college is over, so is Thoreau. OK?<br /><br />Come we now to the writing and editing. With the latter we can easily dispense: The publisher evidently did. Surely there was no editor of this book; just someone who had lunch with the author? (Yeesh, what a racket. And all those years I worked for a living.) As for the writing, it never rises abovethe pedestrian, and I make no pun. It never gets as good as workmanlike and is often visibly worse. Wren inhabits a world in which &quot;battered&quot; taxis drive him to &quot;ramshackle&quot; towns; where the beers are &quot;frosty,&quot; the sandwiches &quot;scrumptious&quot; and the steaks--oh my god, the steaks!--are &quot;seared to perfection.&quot;<br />Walkers have a tradition of writing really fine works: RLS, Hilaire Belloc come to mind, as do Wordsworth, Coleridge and Hazlitt, among many others. But then this is not a walking book. It's a plodder.--Bill Marsano is a professional editor and an award-winning writer on travel, and wines and spirits.	2004-05-04

Not so many years ago the \\"futurists\\" whose job it is to see what the next few years will bring boldly predicted that Americans would soon eat fully half of their meals outside the home. I laughed; I scoffed; I failed to see the light. Here it is 20 years or so later and the futurists were right. We breakfast at McDonald's and IHOP; we lunch there too; and we eat dinner at \\"family restaurants\\" like Sizzler, Outback, Ponderosa and the Olive Garden. Of course when I say 'we' I don't include me, and that's not because I'm a snob who thinks the Rusty Scupper, Mario's Pasta Garden and the like are beneath him (although I wouldn't eat at any of them on a bet). It's just that I just don't like restaurants in general, even the tony and expensive ones. I like to eat at home with friends and family, and I wish more people did. They'd eat better and save a bundle besides.<br />A fellow who wishes likewise is Russell Cronkhite, who spent 12 years as executive chef of Blair House, the official guest quarters provided to international dignitaries visiting Washington, D.C. When Cronkhite says that what he cooked for important foreign guests was, essentially, \\"Sunday dinner,\\" he means it in the traditional over-the-river-and-through-the-woods-to-grandmother's-house-we-go, Leave It to Beaver manner. In other words, the sort of dinner that too many of us don't bother with any more.<br />That's what Cronkhite gives us here, hoping we'll be brave enough to tackle something grand instead of ordering take-out again. The 20 or so complete menus presented run from the ceremonial to the casual to the celebratory, and although they include the occasional nod to the international or the up to date, they're basically all-American standards: roast beef and pan gravy, peppercorn steak, pork (sage-rubbed roast, or chops smothered or stuffed), glazed baked ham, butterflied lamb, chicken and dumplings. You get the picture--this is what the team 'meat and potatoes' was made for, and I doubt any diner will leave Cronkhite's table unsatisfied. Some won't be able to leave at all.<br />There are handsome and honey photos galore and lots of foodish quotations from notable writers and diners: Mark Twain, Thomas Jefferson, Louis May Alcott and Washington Irving (there are also some quotations that oughtn't to have been quoted at all, but they're made up for by useful do-ahead tips).<br />It should be noted that this book is aimed at beginners, and the recipes proceed in a very basic, step-by-step manner. No way can anyone go wrong with this book, but cooks of some experience are likely to find that approach irritating, because it's so slow and cautious.So give this to the ambitious beginner--someone who's not afraid to tackle a fairly big project so long as she is assured of complete and reliable guidance. Or he, for that matter. Either way, there's a high probability of success.--Bill Marsano, an award-wining writer on wine, food and travel, cooks often for his family.	2004-04-28

Is there a campaign against Irshad Manji's book? Certainly it seems something odd is afoot. Impartial readers should examine the reviews posted (52 as of April 10) and decide for themselves. I have; here are my conclusions:<br />Thirty reviews are positive--3 to five stars--and 14 (nearly 50%) are by people who have reviewed for Amazon before. Only 7 (less than 25%) are anonymous, signed &quot;A Reader&quot;). In general, the reviewers discuss the merits of the &lt;book&gt;.<br />Twenty-two reviews are hostile--almost all only 1 star--and only 5 (about 23%) are by previous Amazon reviewers. (One claims a children's game caused repeated vomiting by her child; reviews a $2.79 screwdriver; and attacks a book she admits not having read. In short, she doesn't review--she rants.) Nine (about 40%) are anonymous. Many are merely ad hominem attacks on the author, who is described as dishonest, ignorant, money-hungry, publicity-seeking (even fatwa-seeking) and fostering a &quot;craze for Islamophobia.&quot; One calls Manji &quot;simply not a Muslim&quot; because of her &quot;inability to read Arabic, absence from active Mulim worship, embrace of the West and its secular values, not to mention her identity as a Lesbian feminist.&quot;<br />I believe Amazon's reader-reviews are important and should not be distorted by partisan attacks. Readers should be alert to possible unfairness in this case. Now (at last) to the book itself.<br />Manji addresses her fellow Muslims thus: &quot;I have to be honest with you. Islam is on pretty thin ice with me. I'm hanging on by my fingernails . . . .&quot;  What sounds like a nifty, snappy, wise-ass opener is, it soon becomes clear, really an expression of pain. Spirituality is important to Manji, and she feels her religion has betrayed her--from childhood onward--and she makes a number of important points.<br />First, she rejects the notion, popular since 9/11, that the problem isn't Islam but that Islam has been 'highjacked' by murderous psychopaths. No, she says: Mainstream Islam IS the culprit; it is cruel and even brutal toward women, toward Jews, toward Christians, toward all other infidels--even toward other Muslims. Dissident Muslims can be and have been beaten, imprisoned, killed. Muslims who aren't religious enough (e.g., those impious, kite-flying Afghanis) have been crushed. (Indeed, they were the Taliban's first victims: There's nothing fundamentalists hate more than apostates.)<br />As for the simplistic idea that &quot;you mustn't confuse Islam with culture,&quot; she's all too well aware that Islam and such cultural horrors as Sharia law go hand in hand, each supporting the other. Sharia law, you may recall, means honor killings, punishing homosexuals by toppling walls on them, punishing adulteresses by stoning them to death, and defining rape victims as adulteresses.<br />She is clear on Islam's hermetic nature: Ask a question and get no answer, especially if you're a woman. Propose interpretation and be told the Koran is the literal word of God--and that the 'hadiths' or secondary sources are likewise not to be questioned, analyzed, interpreted. The source of this closed view is, she says, &quot;desert Islam&quot;--the narrow, harsh Wahabist Islam of Saudi Arabia. Its hermeticism is only increasing. The Koran, according to fundamentalists, can't be translated but must be read in Arabic (some also believe that only Arabs are &quot;real Muslims&quot;), and the Wahabist madressas (religious schools) don't want many people to read it even in Arabic. They don't teach reading but foster illiteracy; their students must learn to recite Koranic verses by rote.<br />Very interesting: What you can't read, you can't question or analyze or parse. You can't even know there are contradictory Koranic passages of compassion and tolerance toward non-believers and other beliefs. Can they be literally God's words? &quot;The Koran is so profoundly at war with itself,&quot; says Manji, &quot;that Muslims who 'live by the book' have no choice but to choose what to emphasize and what to downplay.&quot; Unless, of course, they're madressa-trained illiterates who will never know the contradictions exist. Imagine that: a religion with a vested interest in illiteracy. Is that a recipe for backwardness, or what?<br />Manji says most &quot;moderate Mulims&quot; allow these and other abuses to continue without protest. They remain silent--silent except, Manji says, for &quot;screaming self-pity.&quot; Indeed, Muslims are frequently quoted in the New York Times on being maginalized, discriminated against and harmed by &quot;backlash&quot; and Islamophobia. Really? Such reports conspicuously lack anything but accusations and charges; there are never any facts. If Muslims in America in particular and the West in general were being victimized, do you not think you'd have heard about it by now? Manji's view and mine is that Western Muslims either support the abuses of desert Islam--or they are crippled by fear of retirbution.<br />In 217 pages Manji cannot be a scholar nor a historian. She goes a little too easily on the West and Isrtael at times. But she is successful at raising important questions, contradictions and challenges. She is not the best of writers--her tone is urgent, insistent and unmoldulated (to the point of being tedious at times). But her flaws are few and her courage cannot be questioned.--Bill Marsano is a professional writer and editor.	2004-04-11

The Battle of Leyte Gulf, in October of 1944, is still the greatest naval battle in history: Two gigantic armadas, Japanese and American, clashed as the Americans tried to take back the Philippines. Beyond the enormous forces involved, this battle, or series of battles, has other fascinations. For one, it was the last clash of the big-gun navies--battleship to battleship (featuring American battleships resurrected from Pearl Harbor). We shall not see its like again. Two, an American fleet was decoyed, leaving the invasion beaches with little protection. Three, that little protective force thereupon responded with what many consider the finest display of heroism, sacrifice and fighting seamanship in the history of the U.S. Navy.<br />James D. Hornfischer covers all three areas--plus some postwar history, including the reason the Navy has been wary of celebrating what he calls &quot;the U.S. Navy's Finest Hour. If his prose rarely rises above the workmanlike, that's OK, because it seldom sinks to cheap melodrama and also (so far as I can tell) avoids the kind of amateurish mistakes and ignorant howlers that marred the likes of Craig Nelson's &quot;The First Heroes.&quot; Indeed, Hornfischer does an excellent job of conveying the WWII naval milieu, probably because (despite his evident youth and lack of naval background) he seems to have done real research, incl.uding his own interviews. We come to know that there are human beings involved; this is not just a tale about sheet metal and shellfire. That means we are powerfully affected when he talks about the cost. He does not shrink from the terrible sufferings and horrible deaths involved, whether from scalding steam or explosions or fires in battle--or from delerium, exposure and sharks during an aftermath of long-delayed rescue.<br />The center of this story comes after the battleship duel (a disaster for the Japanese): When the decoy succeeds, Japan's powerful Center Force is left free to swoop intoLeyte Gulf and destroy Gen. Douglas MacArthur's invasion force on the beach. Standing in the way (and utterly unaware) is Taffy 3, whose job is simply air support for the troops.<br />It's hard to express the imbalance between the two forces, which is so great it makes David vs. Goliath resemble a sporting proposition. The Japanese have 11 destroyers, 2 light cruisers, 6 heavy cruisers and 4 battleships (the largest of which, the Yamato, outweighs all of Taffy 3's ships combined). Taffy 3's excellent Fletcher-class destroyers are, as Hornfischer aptly notes, its only ships &quot;not conceived as lesser versions of a more capable vessel.&quot; Taffy 3's 6 aircraft carriers, for example, are mere escort or &quot;jeep&quot; carriers (never intended for fleet actions). Its remaining ships are 4 of the frankly desperate &quot;destroyer escorts,&quot; mainly intended for antisubmarine work.<br />The clash of these forces makes for exciting reading; as a Hollywood script it would be laughed out of town as outrageous fiction, but it is in fact true and inspiring. It would be unfair to the book to go into details here, but I should add that Hornfischer is particularly good on the ship-by-ship tactical end. Too many other accounts have focused excessively on Japanese confusion: While that did weigh in the balance, it's also clear that in some cases David simply outfought Goliath--and out-thought him, too.--Bill Marsano is a long-time amateur of naval history.	2004-03-30

The very first thing you should know is that this is a book about collecting, not just book collecting. Collecting--the determined search for specific objects on a given theme--is pretty much the same kind of mania for all collectors, whether they're after vintage cars, rare stamps and coins or--as in this case--books, and whether the treasure they seeks are top dollar or bottom. Every kind of collecting develops its own little cultures and subcultures, its side streets and back alleys, its characters loved or hated or legendary. And, of course, its litany of heart-lifting successes and heart-breaking failures. So if you collect (as distinct from accumulate) or if you know a collector, this book is a definite buy.<br />John Baxter's collecting, which began with science fiction, made him into a short-story writer then a scriptwriter then a novelist and a teacher. He begins his trek in a desolate tank town in Australia, where things start slowly, but he soon moves on--and ups the pace and tension--to London, the U.S. (East Coast and West) and finally Paris. The whole journey runs along like a thrill ride as you join Baxter in a series of adventures and misadventures with his assortment of bookstruck ne-er-do-wells and genial lowlifes.<br />There are only pluses to this book. Plenty of amusing incidents and anecdotes, lots of inside information about book collecting (appplicable to collecting in general) and to top it all off, superb writing. Baxter writes vivid, imaginative, entertaining prose. He is a delight to read.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning travel writer, an editor and a desultory book collector.	2004-02-23

Stewart Chang Berman lives up to his promise to give us 'America's favorite Chinese recipes in this volume, as you can see for yourself. They're all here: won ton soup, shrimp in garlic sauce, lobster Cantonese, General Tso's chicken, Hunan beef, pepper steak and many more, including one of his signature 'fusion' dishes, Sichuan blackened shrimp. In short, just about everything you can find at your storefront Ptomaine Wok take-out is here, 160 or so recipes, potstickers (fried meat dumplings) included.<br />Most recipes are gratifyingly simple: More than a hundred run to no more than five steps. Of course Chinese cooking requires some unusual ingredients and equipment, but surely we are no longer stunned at the sight of a wok or star anise? In any event, the author pitches in with helpful sections on ingredients, equipment, techniques and basic sauces. He even includes--for the neophytes among us--the cornstarch mixture, which is simple (it's cornstarch and water) and, I think, unnecessary. I gave up adding it years ago; my sauces always seemed thick enough without it.<br />The recipes are nicely laid out, usually one to a page. They're clearly written and presented in a readable type face. No fussiness nor fol-de-rol here. Note that the paper is unfinished--not slick and shiny. That means when you use this book at the stove it's best to have one of those clear plastic protectors at hand. Or else be neat, which is beyond me.<br />The real surprise in this book is the author, Stewart Change Berman has been around for some time. He switched from a political-science career to cookery when illness threatened the family restaurant, The Court of the Mandarins, in Washington, D.C. during the Nixon administration--so why haven't we heard from him before? It would appear that he was too busy opening other restaurants (Wok 'n' Roll and The Mandarins, both in or near Washington) to court celebrity.<br />Which is perhaps just as well. This is a honey book withhomey touches, none better than the anecdotes and family memories he sprinkles throughout. In fact, his mother's illustration of the meaning of tact is worth the price of the book all by itself.<br />There are some dinner-menu suggestions troward the back of the book; most contain suggestions for wine. My advice is to forget them. Wine &lt;can&gt; go with Chinese food but it seldom goes willingly. Beer and tea are drunk at table by the Chinese, and who should know better?--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on travel and wine and spirits; he often cooks for his family.	2004-02-23

This is a small book but a large achievement. In less than 40,000 words (about one-third the length of the average novel) Francine Prose commits almost every sin in, as the say, the book. It can't have been easy.<br />Prose is a novelist of some reputation, chosen probably because the editor thinks novelists are Real Writers who will lend credibility to travel writing, which is, after all, journalism's sandbox. (Also because they know travel books by novelists are routinely over-praised.)<br />Prose's passion for Sicily is dubious. Although she claims often and unconvincingly that she wishes to be re-born a Sicilian, she has visited but once before--10 years ago. Such devotion is a little on the cool side, is it not?<br />Does she have some insights to ipart? Indeed, she tells us traffic in Palmermo is 'homicidal'; that Catanians love sweets immoderately; that Sicilian life 'burns at a high heat'; that the Ancient Greeks wouldn't recognize Sicily today; the Sicilian food is not subtle; that Sicilians have a gift for overcoming tragedy that is specifically their own. Her silly comments on the Sicilian aristocracy are at least mildly amusing.<br />And her writing is both awful and lazy. She writes in the present tense--the lazy way of getting to the bottom of the page, of getting it over with, with a minimum of effort. (&quot;Name&quot; writers love book assignments like this because they pay well, but their work ethic often deserts them. They think they're on vacation.) Like so many other bad travel writers, Prose is short of imagination: She can't get past the first graf without reaching for &quot;magical,&quot; the travel hack's favorite word.<br />She piles up words instead of really writing. For example, when she wants to tell us that 'many pilgrims in a religious procession carry candles' (that's eight words) she says instead that they &quot;carry long yellow candles they will light in the course of their peregrination around the holy sites associated with the saint scattered through the old quarter&quot; (that's twenty-six). What we want from a writer is some electricity in the words, some vigor, some sign of delight in mastery of language. Prose gives us prose, not poetry--drab, bloated, prosaic prose, comma-crippled and tedious.<br />She uses crutches so often I began counting them. Eternally indecisive, she says 'seems' more than 60 times, occasionally switching to 'perhaps,' 'almost,' 'maybe' and 'a little like.' She finds things 'disturbing' nine times and also leans on 'perilous,' 'upsetting,' 'alarming' and 'spooky.' Well of course: The Real Writer does NOT enjoy herself, especially because she is in Sicily &quot;to discover what this island has learned and can teach us about the triumph of beauty over violence of life over death.&quot; (Really?)<br />Prose often mentions 9/11 as if she were the only one affected by it. She experiences &quot;panic&quot; at an old castle and again while planning to visit Mozia, a tiny island a few yards off the coast: &quot;. . . what if the fisherman who ferries us out there gets distracted and forgets about us, and we're stuck out there all night? What if we're stranded, exposed to the elements, alone with the spirits of the Phoenician traders who first came to Mozia in the eighth century B.C. and who lived in harmony with their Greek neighbors until the Carthaginian wars, when Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse, using catapults, missiles and battering rams--state-of-the-art tools of fourth-century warfare--destroyed the settlement and much of its population?&quot;<br />What if, indeed. This is  drama-queen panic--she's still in her hotel. If stranded, she can just return to the island's museum and tell the attendant. And why on earth would she write or commit such a gross and clumsy sentence to begin with?<br />Apart from the awful writing, Prose misquotes Goethe and commits numerous grammatical and spelling errors. Everyone connected with this shabby performance should be embarrassed, copy editor included.--Bill Marsano is a professional magazine editor and an award-winning travel writer.	2004-02-20

The lure of the Old West and the Open Range is as powerful for those who want to get back in the saddle again as for those who have never so much as fallen off a horse in the first place. And so the dude ranch was born--a place where city slickers could go to grow saddle-sore and be laughed at, made mock by the few genuine cowboys--sorry, that should be &quot;hands&quot;--still on the ranch. Or spread. Well, that was then. Dude ranches have grown up so much that few use the term any more. These days what we have are ranch vacations.<br />They're not all the same, and to tell them apart you need a guide like this, which covers 100 ranches in 19 states (including, oddly enough, New York) and two Canadian provinces. Now most anybody can fling together a lot of data--phone numbers, addresses, rates, etc.--but Gavin Ehringer has done a better and more complete job than most (in one entry he notes that a ranch accepts Visa but actually prefers personal checks). Ehringer gives a lot more. Each ranch is introduced by a one-page essay that captures the spirit of the place and helps you tell one from another. Do you want a family vacation, kids and all? A place where you break most of your broncos poolside? Or a real, tall-in-the-saddle spread that will make you earn your memories with a few blisters and sore muscles? Ehgringer helps you sort that out.<br />And if that's not enough, there's a beautifully shot photo essay of vacation-ranch life that will have you humming &quot;Don't Fence Me In&quot; in no time.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning travel writer.	2004-02-18

Under the current low standards for political discourse, President Bush is a traitor to his country; he is also Hitler (a role he took over from former Fuhrer Rudolph Giuliani). Our Constitution has been shredded; our civil rights rendered null and void; dissent a grave risk and feminists are \\"feminazis.\\" We are informed of all this by politically inflamed nitwits who ought to read this book: It will tell them what fascism really is.<br />Child of privilege, daughter of an ancient family, Azar Nafisi grew up and was educated abroad, not at home under the oppressive Shah. At the University of Oklahoma, she (among other things) joined an Iranian revolutionary students' group. She admits to being only half-convinced; to being carried away by excitement and rhetoric, and she certainly missed the warning signs. Only now does she realize that her revolutionary group \\"exerted a strong hold over its members' lifestyles and social activities\\"; that the militants \\"came to dominate the group, ousting or isolating the more moderate.\\" Chic for revolutionary women was cropped hair, Mao jackets, no makeup.<br />And so in the fullness of time the Shah was deposed and Nafisi returned to Iran in time for the victory feast--the one in which the Revolution ate its young.<br />This happens every time but rarely does it happen with such a vengeance. In the new Islamic Republic, the members of Islamic Jihad were mere moderates! And so began the endless oppressions of the innocent public. It was not enough that the war against women--that feared and hated sex--buried them in chadors and veils. No, even wearing nail polish under gloves was a crime.<br />And this is what Nafisi brings us to: She, an intelligent woman, a professor, a lover of literature, is expelled from her university for not wearing the veil, and as she begins this narrative she is teaching a handful of her old students in her home. They gather once a week to discuss Nabokov, Fitzgerald, Henry James, Jane Austen. They use the last available paperbacks in Tehran--and copies run off on a Xerox machine. And what they are doing is a crime.<br />A reader needn't go too many pages into this book before he begins to realize what phrases like \\"shredded Constitution\\" and \\"no civil rights\\" REALLY mean, and they don't mean anything like the inconvenient clauses of the Patriot Act. There's more than enough of literary criticism here, and the politically minded reader can resort to a little skimming to focus on what really counts. Which is this: When you can with a straight face tell a woman the the fate of the entire revolution depends on her wearing a veil(!), then of course you can expel her when she refuses. And such a person can also be abused and humiliated in the street, jumped by armed \\"morality squads.\\" She can also be beaten. And arrested for long periods of time. Well, once we've gone that far, can she also be killed? Why, yes, she can. Several of Nafisi's other women friends and students met such a fate. And several more of those she left behind (she is now safely and sanely teaching in the U.S.) will certainly suffer similar the same.<br />This is a sad book, and it is one that shows as well as tells. It's clear that the tyrants who currently run Iran, who simply declare ineligible all candidates who don't knuckle under, are utterly incurious, dangerously certain, homicidally smug. They have the Truth. They own the Truth. That's why there are no books to buy. No need for books when you've got the Guardian Council to tell you how to live, how to behave and what to believe.--Bill Marsano is a voracious reader and a professional writer.	2004-02-16

Just why it fell from favor isn't entirely clear, but now, more or less all of a sudden, it's back. And in comes with this handsome book--a real lapful of pleasure--to do it justice. Certainly the new interest in cocktails of recent years has fostered the comeback, and so has the long-delayed realization that there really isn't any such thing as &quot;rum.&quot; Instead, there are many, many rums--each different by style or flavor or the whim of its maker. Rum shows as many personalities as malt scotch does, in fact. Finally, serious drinkers have recognized that while there are plenty of raffish, piratical rums of the &quot;Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest&quot; variety, there are others that are made as carefully and aged and lovingly as fine cognacs.<br />David Broom is our guide here--he's a good writer (author of numerous other books on fine drink) and a real expert in the realm of distillative arts. Wisely he doesn't try to cover every rum from every place (there are far too many, after all). Instead he focuses on the home country of rum, which is the Caribbean basin and the Spanish Main (which means, of course, mainland, so we get the word on rums from Venezuela, Guatemala, Guyana, Brazil and elsewhere). But he concentrates on the islands: Barbados, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, Trinidad, the Virgin Islands (U.S. and British) are of principal importance. And of course there are little oddities. Bermuda has its own famous run but grows no sugar cane; the Caymans are known for what might be called &quot;J. and B.&quot;--a blend of Jamaican and Barbadian rums. My personal favorite is what Broom rightly calls the &quot;fearsome&quot; Jack Iron, which comes from Trinidad but is unreasonably popular in Grenada and its sister island of Carriacou. It was also illegal--contraband--at least until recently.<br />I bring this up to illustrate rum's breadth of personality. Jack Iron is a punishing 151 proof but it has been legalized for sale to Grenada's tourists--they pick it up at the airport as a ruffianly souvenir. But I prefer its contraband version, still smuggled in to Carriacou. Every time I visit I call at a certain saloon in Hillsborough, which is just down the road for that lovely airport that has to have cars and cattle chased off the runway, and after some idle chit-chat I ask the barman if he can sell me a bottle of Jack Iron. &quot;Not the fancy kind,&quot; I say. &quot;I want the stuff that comes over in a neighborly kind of way.&quot; At which point he'll hand me a clear liquid in a recycled plastic soda bottle. It'll have a cheap black-and-white paper label stuck onto it bearing the name Jack Iron and a skull and crossbones. In short, he'll hand me the real McCoy.<br />Broom does an excellent job of covering the connoisseur rums that are leading this spirit's resurgence, but he doesn't neglect rum's splendidly disreputable side either. It's importand, even critical to understanding rum becuase rum IS a disreputable drink. It was first made from industrial waste--that's what molasses was, after all. And its roots are sunk deep in the misery of slavery and the woes of drunken sailors.<br />Broom provides helpful guides to appreciating rum and to individual brands of note. Finally, there's a raft of fine, color-saturated photographs by Jason Lowe, to top off this truly fine book.--Bill Marsano has won a James Beard medal for his writing on wines and spirits.	2003-12-28

This book comes along just in time: Already I've been getting invitations from French tourism folks inviting me to learn all about their plans for next year's 60th anniversary of D-Day. (Do they actually give a damn any more, or are they just trying to revive their critically wounded tourist trade?) Think of it--sixty years. Soon enough there'll be no one left alive to tell the tale, and then the whole shebang--World War II from front to back--will be deeded over to Ken Burns for a series of sincere and oh-so-tasteful documentaries for his caramel-centered fans to lap up on PBS.<br />It's probably all that &quot;good war&quot; and &quot;greatest generation&quot; stuff that drove Fussell to write this book; he doesn't have much truck with gooey backward glances, and that will probably make some readers mad. Well, you don't come to Fussell--author of, among other things, &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb, and Other Essays&quot;--for good times. You come to Fussell for the hard stuff.<br />And here it is his contention that behind and beneath all that &quot;greatest generation&quot; nonsense was the Boys' Crusade--that last year of the war in Europe when too many things went wrong too often. The generals who'd convinced themselves that this war would not be a war of attrition--i.e., human slaughter--like the last one found they'd guessed wrong. Casualties were horrifyingly high and so huge numbers of children--kids 17-19 years--old were flung into combat. And they were, with the help of the generals, ill-trained, ill-clothed and ill-equipped.<br />They were also faceless ciphers. As Fussell points out, the US Army's policy was to break up training units by sending individual replacements up to the line piecemeal--one at a time--so they often arrived as strangers among strangers, often addressed merely as &quot;Soldier&quot; because no one knew their names. The result was too many instances of cowardice--both under fire and behind the lines--too many self-inflicted wounds to escape combat. Too many disgraces of every kind because the Army's system, Fussell says, destroyed the most important factor in the fighting morale of the &quot;poor bloody infantry&quot;--the shame and fear of turning chicken in front of your comrades. Many of these boys--and Fussell is properly insistent on the word boys--funked because they had no comradeship to value.<br />This is not in the least a personal journal. Fussell was serriously wounded as a young second lieutenant; he was also decorated. But he wisely leaves himself out of this narrative. There's no special pleading here, no showing of the wounds on Crispin's Day. Instead this is a passionate but straightforward report on what that last year was like for the poor bloody infantry--those foot soldiers, those dogfaces, those 14 percent of the troops who took more than 70 percent of the casualties.<br />And yet there were those who stood the gaff, who survived &quot;carnage up to and including bodies literally torn to pieces, of intestines hung on trees like Christ,mas festoons,&quot; and managed not to dishonor themselves. They weren't heroes, Fussell says, just men who earned the Combat Infantryman's Badge, which was the only honor they respected. In a brief but moving passage, he explains why: It said they'd been there, been through it, and toughed it out.<br />This is a very short book. It's only 160 or so pages of text and they are small, paperback-sized pages. Nevertheless this book is an object lesson in writing that hits home like a blow to the solar plexus, that can double you over in pain and shock. I don't know a professional writer who wouldn't be proud to have written it.--Bill Marsano is a writer and editor with a long-time interest in military writing.	2003-12-25

Cause for rejoicing! The Contessa seldom uses her title; in fact, she prefers to be known for her cooking and her cooking school. And so she is--internationally. The importance of her title is only this: It ties her to Regaleali, the great estate that has been at the heart of Sicily for centuries--since the time, in fact, of the Arab conquest, when the place was known as Rahal-Ali or Village of Ali. Sicilian cooking isn't &quot;Italian cooking&quot;--it's one of the 20 or so related cuisines to be found in Italy, and it is at the same time the most and least original. Most because it is so little akin to any of the others; least because it's really a composite, developed from so many other source cuisines: Greek, Roman, Arab,  Norman, French, Spanish. Still, it's not exactly a mystery because so many of the 19th-Century immigrants to America were Sicilians, and their food was, for many of us, the first &quot;Italian food&quot; we tasted. The book naturally follows a seasonal menu--Regaleali, though mostly a winery, remains enough of a farm to grow most of its own food. Also, since the sea in Sicily is never far away, there is much to be made of anchovies and swordfish and tuna. Finally, since we are in Sicily, the sweets and pastries are breath-taking. The Contessa is a non-nonsense cook, I was relieved to find. For all her fame and stature she is perfectly content with boullion cubes, noting only that pepper and especially salt must be added with great care at the end of cooking to avoid over-seasoning. Likewise she's not one of those who claim that olive oil cannot be kept for more than a year--keep it cool and in the dark, she says, and it will keep far longer. You will find here recipes familiar and recipes startlingly new to you, and there is overall a conversationalapproach: You feel as if you and she are cooking on the same side of the stove. Most important you will find that the Contessa's beauty and dignity infuse her prose style as well. To take but one example: &quot;The winter sunshine in Sicily is one of the most beautiful things you can experience. I remember one magical day, one of those days I call a gift from God. The sky was blue, blue, blue, and the countryside green everywhere. From where I stood, I could see the Madonie Mountains, covered with snow, and Etna, also snowcapped, in the distance. All around me was silence, except for a few birds here and there talking to one another.&quot; The recipes are clearly laid out and easy enough to follow. You will want to take care to purchase Regaleali wines, which bear the label of the Counts Tasca d-Almerita, to serve with them (look them up at [...] The many, many photographs are spectacular.--Bill Marsano is a James Beard award-winning writer on wine, food and travel.	2003-12-19

If you haven't heard of Jack and Dolores Cakebread it's probably because their wine is so fine it's always on allocation--there's not enough to go around, so the annual production is allocated to customers and restaurateurs who supported the Cakebreads when they founded their family winery in Napa in 1973. Still, you can get a taste of the Cakebreads and their way of life through this handsome book, written with their resident chef, Brian Streeter. One guiding principle here is the seasons: They dictate life at the winery, and so the recipes are seasonal as well. Another guiding principle is &quot;Napa style&quot;--the kind of relaxed elegance the area has become known and envied for. It's simple, stylish and superb. The recipes are clearly presented one to a page in legible type, and they come from many sources. Of course one expects Hispanic and Italian dishes--the Spanish discovered the place and the Italians were among the first to grow wine there. But the Cakebreads have cast their net wide to cover most of the Mediterranean basin--southern France, Morocco, Greece are also included--and there are Pacific Rim and Asian influences as well. And just for lagniappe, there are several recipes contributed by guest chefs at the Cakebreads' annual American Harvest Workshop. After a few pages of this you are going to have a powerful inclination to get yourself out to Napa.

Putting in a new faucet means taking out your old one, so you head off to the hardware store. So far, so good, but because you are an unrepentant sinner it is not Ace, the place with the helpful hardware man; neither is it, say, Home Depot, which has a pretty aggressive program of training its employees (they call 'em 'associates') so they will understand what you want even when you don't. Which is the case just now. You need that weird little tool with the sping-loaded half-claw gripper that works at right angles to the handle, and the clerk you're talking to breathes through his mouth, can't focus more than one eye at a time and can't think of anything to say except &quot;If you don't see it on the shelf, we're out of it.&quot; (That, brothers, is the Official Lie of American retailing.)<br />Only then does the manager arrive. You start over and within 10 seconds he stops you and says, &quot;Right--a basin wrench. Why didn't you say so?&quot; And now you're the one who feels like a dope. As you would if you needed trammel points (or heads), a spud wrench, some castellated nuts or a box of pinch dogs.<br />Your house and workshop are full of such things or should be, but they aren't, so you have to go get them at the least convenient times from clerks singularly ill-equipped to assist you.<br />If you have this little book your life will be a lot easier, because you will be able to ask for things like angle stops, hawks, ballcocks and four-in-hand rasps with the ease of a pro. These item,s have thjeir strange and partoicular little names because they are partocular things. A pinch dog, for example, is not exactly the same as a pinch puppy. We started with a sink, remember? With this book you'll flip to Part VIII (plumbing stuff), flip past fixtures and fittings and pipes and valves until you come to implements of destruction, where sure enough between Plumbing Wrenches (p. 555) and Special Plumbing Tools (p. 571) you will find the basin wrench of your dreams, probably with a nice picture to help you out.<br />Same goes for all other areas of do-it-yourself house-damaging--walls and floors, electrics, windows and more.<br />All in all, you would think this is a very handy little book, but it's not. It is very useful and very helpful but not at all handy. In fact it's damned clumsy: It measures 4-1/4 by 5-1/2 inches and is about as thick as a brick. You can see that it isn't especially easy to flip through. Worse, the type and illustrations are commensurate with the page size, which means they're too small unless you're used to reading insurance contracts. OK, it's a good book--but if re-sized to the proportions of a standard paperback it would be terrific. Still, that's its only flaw.--Bill Marsano can drive a nail without hitting his thumb, but that's about it. What he's really good at is going to hardware stores on sale days.	2003-12-09

When the Rival company introduced its Crock Pot about 30 years ago, it was an instant hit--but it soon drew criticism on two fronts. One problem was that careless people who cooked for too short a time at too low a temperature had turned it into a germ-breeding device, making a few people sick. That problem does not occur if folks will follow the admirably clear and simple directions provided by the author of this book.<br />There were also somewhat snooty complaints about crock cuisine being a bit low class--the sort of stuff to be found at church socials, covered-dish suppers and even tailgate picnics. Well, that is in part true--but so what? Slow cooking is what our grannies did when they pushed their cast-iron pots of beef stew to the back burners of their woodstoves and let them simmer for most of the day. I know I always wanted seconds. Didn't you?<br />The secret to slow cooking is good ingredients, which you can get with ease, and good recipes, which you can get in this book, written by an expert with two previous crock-pot books to her credit.<br />Now I will admit that we are not talking haute cuisine here. These are practical, stick-to-your-ribs dishes for enthusiastic eaters. At the same time they are not simple, boring, one-note recipes. Ms. Pye shows no fears of herbs and spices, which she uses frequently (&quot;season liberally!&quot; she cries). That gives her entree to many of what we call 'ethnic' cuisines (Oriental, Russian and Indian among them). Let me add, too, that Pye's not necessarily devoted to culinary authenticity. Recipes such as risotto without rice and polenta tamale pie are more about creativity or maybe even desperation than anything else. Still, there are plenty of recognizable dishes here, well rendered, and some real innovations. (I confess it never occurred to me that I might make a cheesecake in a crock pot.)<br />Busy people--parents with kids and schedules or singles cooped up in offices till dark--can benefitfrom slow cooking. If they use this book to make one or two meals a week they'll save money, eat better and feel better. Another good thing about the slow cooker is that its safety (no open flame, generally low temperatures) makes it a great way to start the kids learning their way around a kitchen. (Given the chance, most kids actually love cooking.)<br />The recipes are clearly written and presented one to a page on non-reflective paper. Thisd is a practical, useful book.--Bill Marsano has done most of the cooking for his family over the past few years, and they seem none the worse for it.	2003-11-10

Well here we are, me hearties, smack in the middle of the Age of Fighting Sail, when the Royal Navy--Nelson's Navy--made clear to the world that Britannia ruled the waves. Our foe be the awful French led by the beastly Napoleon, who makes no secret of his imperial ambitions. Britain, that nation of shopkeepers, aims to stop him. Are we having fun yet, or what?<br />Shakespeare put it about that \\"ships are but boards,\\" yet few sailors would agree. Most come to believe that ships--some, at least--are living things, possessed of souls. They love them as if they are living beings. Such a ship is the subject of this \\"biography,\\" which reads like a novel but is factual from keel to truck. The ship is HMS Bellerophon--Billy Ruffian to her crew. A most fortunate ship, designed by Britain's leading naval architect, Sir Thomas Slade, and built by a great constructor, Edward Greaves. Launched in 1786, she was officered and crewed according to her deserts, and then sailed uniquely into history. No other ship, I think played such a part in the conflicts of that era.<br />Bellerophon fought splendidly in the three greatest seafights of the Napoleonic era, the Glorious First of June in 1794, the Battle of the Nile in 1798 and Trafalgar in 1805. For her, the greatest of the trio was doubtless the Nile. In that action Nelson found the French at anchor in Aboukir Bay, west of the mouth of the Nile, formidably protected by their advantage in numbers of both ships and guns, by their powerful defensive formation in a shallow, treacherous bay, and by the approaching night.<br />That didn't stop Nelson nor did it stop the Ruffian. She laid alongside the French flagship, L'Orient, and the two hammered each other with unrelenting broadsides. The Ruffian was dismasted and hideously mauled, but although L'Orient had bigger guns and more of them (120 to the Ruffian's 74), the Ruffian had Jack Tar and Dick Nastyface--and they had hearts of oak. L'Orient was set afire, and as the fire spread toward her powder magazines the Ruffian slipped her cables to drift clear of what would become that battle's single best-remembered moment: L'Orient blown to kingdom come in a detonation that was heard and seen 20 miles away--and re-created in countless paintings of the fight.<br />Then came Trafalgar and after that a remarkable post-Waterloo climax. For it was on Billy Ruffian's deck that Napoleon, after much shilly-shallying about whether to flee or to fold, and deluded with the notion of an honorable retirement as a prisoner on a little farm in the English countryside, finally surrendered to the Crown, his implacable enemy.<br />And then? Peacetime doldrums. In time, Bellerophon was struck from the list, disarmed, dismasted and \\"hulked\\"--turn into a prison ship or hulk for the remainder of her days. The veteran David Cordingly does a handsome job of telling Bellerophon's story, and he doesn't slacken his attention even during her  days as a hulk. The result is salty pleasure from beginning to end.--Bill Marsano is a longtime devotee of sailing books.	2003-10-29

One reason World War II dramas keep filling books is that half the war has been mostly forgotten--the Pacific part. It was a full-scale war all by itself, and although the U.S. did most of the heavy fighting, these days we remember little more than Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima, and maybe Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima in a pinch.<br />The problem, as in real estate, is location, location, location. The European theater was full of famous cities and works of art and people we knew, or thought we knew. At least had heard of. The Pacific was nothing but millions of square miles of ocean, empty except for Hawaii and large numbers of small islands and smaller tribes.<br />Two of the smallest, least habitable islands were deemed of enormous by both Japan and the U.S., and much blood and treasure were expended on their defense and conquest.<br />The first was Wake, a coral atoll in the middle of nowhere--perfect as a stopover for the old Pan Am Clipper flying boats, but little more. When war began it was populated by about 500 US servicemen--mostly Marines--and about 1000 civilian construction workers. The buildup was too late, the garrison too small (about 60 percent understrength), the guns too old--so naturally, when the Japanese attacked, the troops fought back like lions.<br />For a while it was the biggest morale-building story of the war. And the only one: The Japanese had stunned us a Pearl Harbor, conquered the Philippines, taken over Guam--and here was this tiny force on a tiny island giving them hell. Indeed they actually beat back the first invasion attempt, sinking some Japanese ships and seriously damaging others. Bombed repeatedly for more than two weeks, the garrison, joined by nearly half the civilians, held out bravely and fought amazingly well. The second invasion attempt was by a truly enormous force; it succeeded, but only after the defenders had punished it severely.<br />Even today questions remain. Could Wake's defenders have held out longer, even won? Who was responsible for the surrender order, so bitterly resented by most of the Marines? What did the relief fleet sail from Pearl Harbor--and then turn back?<br />I won't go into that here--that's Bill Sloan's job. It is good to have him bring this battle and these heroes back to us. He plods a bit in the beginning and his writing is only workmanlike, but that's OK--he doesn't get in the way of the story or the men who played their parts it it. And once the shooting starts the story achieves its own momentum. As suggested above, there's controversy to spare in the Wake Island story, and Sloan does a good job of handling it fairly. This is a worthwhile read.<br />In the end, Wake was of strategic importance to no one. The Japanese won it and probably wished they hadn't. US Navy ships heading elsewhere used to pound the hell out of it in passing, but we didn't bother trying to get it back. It was useless as a base of operations and almost impossible to supply--by war's end, the Japanese garrison was near starvation.<br />Oh. The other small wretched island? That was Midway. About six months post-Wake the Japanese tried to take that, too, also without having much considered what good it might do them. In the subsequent Battle of Midway, Japan lost the war in about 10 minutes. The US would still have to win it, however, and that would about three more years.--Bill Marsano has been reading about WWII since he was too young to fight in it.	2003-10-25

Ordinary is what you'll get at best, and sub-par more often. Well, that's partly true, even largely true for the hapless, unarmed tourist. And Venice is quintessentially a tourist town. Live with it.<br />Or don't, because there are plenty of good places where Venetians eat, and they are well worth discovering. Fortunately for you, Shannon Essa and Ruth Edenbaum have done that already, and they have published their secrets. In this tiny book they give extensive details on 40 restaurants and 40 bars ranging from cheap to very expensive, from drop in any time to 'reservations strongly recommended,' from calm and delightful to noisy and smoky, from cash to cards.<br />Their attention to detail is excellent. They give you not only menu recommendations but the name of the nearest vaporetto stop AND walking directions from there. (One's gratitude knows no bounds.) They know the little secrets. Of course, everone by now has heard of the ombra, that traditional Venetian cooler, buy do you know the sgroppino? Do you know cichetti? Do you know that when ordering coffee in Venice (and everywhere else in Italy) you should forget anything that you've ever heard (or had) at Starbucks? Well, Essa and Edenbaum do.<br />This is the sort of book that makes you wish longingly to know as much as the authors do. Well, buy it and you're on your way. Note to the publisher: Yo!

He really means he wants to know &quot;How can I get, for a decent price, a bottle that I'll like and that won't embarrass me in front of my friends?&quot;<br />Who can blame him? When knowledgeable wine-lovers say &quot;there are no graduates from wine school,&quot; they're not kidding. The subject is endless if--IF--what you want is to know about wine. For the enormous majority, the people who want only good drink at a good price, this book is a godsend.<br />Felicia Sherbert has two secrets here. The first is that she doesn't bury you in wine-geekery. She does not drone on about rootstocks, degrees Brix and clonal selection; about residual sugar, cold fermentation and barrels of oak (American or French? Limousin or Alliers? Split or sawn? Kiln-dried or air -seasoned?). It's the wine-maker's job to deal with that stuff--not yours.<br />Her next secret is a copious Table of Contents. Its minutely subdivided vastness allows you to get the help you need when you need it by simply sliding your finger down the page.<br />Planning to woo with wine over dinner? Slide down the Table of Contents to &quot;A Little Romance.&quot; Concerned about cost? See &quot;Pick a Price Point.&quot; Don't know how to pull a cork? Worried that it might break? Slide, my friend, slide: Felicia knows you're in trouble and is waiting with the answers. How to decant? What glass to use? How to save the leftover half-bottle? Slide, slide, slide!<br />After a few jaunts down the slippery slope you'll be a happier, braver person. Then you can go back to the Table of Contents and--if you wish--look for sections and subsections that pique your interest. Such as how much to buy for a party. Sweet wines for dessert. The difference between champagne and sparkling wine. How to deal with wine in a restaurant. And so on. And on.<br />This is a handy, helpful, no-nonsense book. Like a puppy that follows you home from school, it'll be a friend for life.--Bill Marsano has won a James Beard medal for wine and spirits writing and is the wine editor of Hemispheres, the magazine of United Airlines.	2003-10-20

Yes, this &lt;is&gt; the Wine Gift-Book of the Year. It's a lush, large-format lapful of treats and temptations--fine photographs and elegant Roman and medieval paintings, plenty of details and, best of all, a high degree of readability. This is no geek's encyclopedia of trivia and minutiae. It's a festival for those who love wine, or want to. The experienced will appreciate the depth of its knowledge; beginners will feel warmly welcome, not discouraged and intimidated.<br /><br />Patricia Guy lives in Verona, one of the major posts of Italy's wine industry, and over a long career she's been a taster, a judge, a lecturer, a consultant, a marketer: She knows what she is about. She tackles her subject alphabetically, grape by grape--almost. Actually she focuses on the most important grapes, providing for each a profile of its history, where it's grown, tasting notes and the wines it produces. (Covering &lt;all&gt; Italian grapes simply isn't feasible, at least not in a book that can be hefted without the aid of a forklift. As the world's Mother Vineyard, Italy has about 350 documented grape varieties and about 1000 more that are still to be fully explored.)<br /><br />And so you're going to get all the details on your big names, such as Sangiovese and Nebbiolo, Verdicchio and Pinot Grigio. Of course. But Guy pays due respect to obscurities and rarities--grapes most folks have never heard of: Erbaluce, Falanghina, Uva di Troia, Coda di Volpe, Nerello Mascalese, and others that have names like songs. (There are also thumbnail sketches of many emerging varieties). She lists leading producers (helpful, because you &lt;will&gt; want to run out and buy) and a goodly selection of recipes. Here too, it's clear that you're in the hands of an expert: In Italy, wine and food have developed in lockstep over many centuries, each contributing to the other. For that reason, Guy's recipes are carefully chosen local and regional dishes; they come from the same soil asthe wines she pairs them with. This is far more perceptive than the quickie approach--&quot;Have a country red with the spaghetti&quot;--so often taken by lesser writers.<br /><br />I may be making the book sound too learned. It &lt;is&gt; learned but also readable and enjoyable. Guy has a nice line in dry wit. Of Cortese wines (&quot;supple, with tenuous aromas&quot;) she says &quot;when describing such wines, the fine line between delicate and insipid has occasionally been blurred.&quot; About one decidedly unnecessary wine she notes that &quot;Some producers also make sparkling Recioto di Soave. It is an acquired taste.&quot;<br /><br />Guy knows that wine is truly about pleasure and delight, and she's happy to let readers in on that secret.--Bill Marsano has won a James Beard medal for wine and spirits writing and is the Wine Editor of Hemispheres, the magazine of United Airlines.<br /><br />--	2003-10-18

The only thing I don't like about this book is the title. Yes, women buy most of the wine in this country. Yes, women are better tasters than men. But why take the risk of losing a whole sex as your audience? So let me say right away: This book is for men, too. It would be a mistake to miss it.<br />It's almost unkind to say this is a book for beginners because there are so many of those around and they are so often failures. Not this one. Sbrocco starts off fresh and plain and simple--and stays that way. She doesn't, as do so many others, suddenly fall to prattling about &quot;degrees Brix&quot; and &quot;clonal selection.&quot; Instead of jargon and intimidation she concentrates on the real values of wine: fun, pleasure, charm, cheer, warmth, and delight. She's got her own way of expressing things, and it works. When she tells you that Pinot Grigio is the denim of wines; when she tells you that the effect of acid in wine is like that of a push-up bra--it lifts and separates--you know what she's talking about, laugh out loud, and want to hear more.<br />Sbrocco knows that wine's foremost place in life is beside food--it is the grace of the civilized table. And so if you know of any wine, look it up and see what she suggests you eat with it. Do that; then look up a dish (or one of her recipes), and see what she suggests you drink with it. Do that, too. Rinse and repeat. Pretty soon you'll understand why I'm so over the moon about this delightful, happy, funny book.--Bill Marsano has won a James Beard medal for writing on wines and spirits; he is also the Wine Editor of Hemispheres Magazine, the in-flight monthly of United Airlines.	2003-10-14
US	48778664	R345Y1M618PUJ6	0471223549	465798011	Wolf Pack: The American Submarine Strategy That Helped Defeat Japan	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Deep Trouble: US Submarines Against Japan	This book begins--one might instead says 'gets off on the wrong foot'--with an odd title. 'Wolf Pack' is, after all, a term associated in military history and the popular imagination with the dread Nazi submarine formations of the same war but a different ocean. It's as odd as if today we called the high-speed assault on Iraq as a blitzkrieg.<br />Be that as it may, 'wolf pack' is the right term: That's what American submariners aimed at creating in World War II (they were well aware of the effective U-boat tactics used in the Atlantic). Author Steven Trent Smith does a good job of explaining how the Navy's Pacific submarine chief, Adm. Charles Lockwood, and others worked to adapt German tactics for use against the Japanese (they started on the checkerboard dance floor of the officers' club). It wasn't easy. For one thing, communications between submarines was unreliable for a long time; another problem was that American sub skippers were used to being 'lone wolves' and didn't want to change.<br />Another problem--in the book as well as the war--is the need to develop 'pro-submarine' equipment, which slows the narrative down. Lockwood wanted improved torpedos (ours were lousy early in the war) but he also sought important devices that would help subs defend themselves. One of them was submarine sonar to help them penetrate minefields. The reader has to be a little patient here because the climax of the book involves infiltrating two wolf packs through minefields guarding the Sea of Japan--the huge Inland Sea between Japan and the Asian mainland.<br />Smith makes clear that sub skippers on both sides sought naval targets and considered merchant ships low class. Eventually the Americans realized that merchantment were the way to go--there were so many more of them and Japan, and island nation, was dependent on shipping. (The Japanese mostly stuck with naval targets, even though America's many Pacific bases were also islands, also fed by sea.)<br />As a writer smith isworkmanlike at best; he did better in his previous book, \\"The Rescue,\\" about Americans hiding in the Philippines from the beginning of the war until rescued by submarine some years later). He's sometimes a little weak on details; I noted a couple of muffed details. Some editing or copy-editing might have helped; publisher please note.<br />His biggest problem is the need to explain so many technical details. This is not a simple subject, and so you don't get here the slam-bang action of Cmdr. Edward L. Beach's famous \\"Run Silent, Run Deep.\\" But Smith does get his licks in at least twice. And is doing so almost rises to 4 tars.<br />His description of the sub Parche's all-out cowboy assault on a convoy in July of 1944 is delightfully hair-raising, and it brings the book to life just in time. He also develops sweaty-palms tension when two wolf packs do at last penetrate Sea of Japan. Knowing something about mines will help, because Hollywood has taught you all wrong. They NOT big round cannisters of TNT bobbing free on the surface.<br />Mines float but they float below the surface, where they can't be seen. They are tethered by long cables to anchors on the sea bottom. Lockwood's packs had two choices. They could make a mad, high-speed surface dash, escaping the mines but risking surface attack, or they could snake through the minefields, using their new (and not battle-tested) sonar to locate the mines, and all their skill to steer their 300-foot subs safely between them.<br />Here Smith screws up the tension. The first time he puts you in a sub that come so close it grazes a mine's cable--and that awful grating, scraping sound inches its horrible way the whole length of the hull at a walking pace of two knots--well, check your palms. They'll be wet.--By Bill Marsano, a long-time devotee of WWII nonfiction books.	2003-09-01
US	48778664	R1S0W91KVCT54E	1891267302	383938005	Icon: Art of the Wine Label	Books	3	14	19	N	N	Three Stars for Wine Geeks--Two for the Rest of Us	By Bill Marsano. This perplexing book is beautifully produced and generously proportioned. The publisher has given his all (not without hope, however, of getting it back--note the price). It's most impressive. So why is it also rather disappointing?<br />Frankly, it's because we are led to expect too much. Title and subtitle suggest a richly informed and wide-ranging survey of label art from many sources over many decades. In fact the coverage spans just a few years, a few places (nearly 85 percent of the designs are from California) and two designers (Jeffrey Caldewey and Chuck House, who are pre-eminent in their field). And the subject isn't art but label and package design: in short, sales tools. Even the title is a pretentious flim-flam. 'Icon' means either 'sacred image,' which is hardly justified here, or those vulgar little cartoons that offend the eye on computer screens the world around. Surely they didn't mean &lt;that>?<br />Then revelation comes: Icon is the name of the design firm headed by Caldewey and House. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is a glorified promotional brochure.<br />Within those rather severe limitations this is a pretty attractive coffee-table production. Each of the more than 100 wines shown has its own page and is shown in full--the whole 'package,' not just the label. Some are delightful, charming, friendly and fun, notably those of Bonny Doon (whose owner is the famously humorous Randall Grahm), Frog's Leap, Gundlach Bundschu, Honig, Whitehall Lane and (too few) others. Elsewhere, elegance is to be found, as is cutting-edge stylishness--and, unfortunately, other labels that seem prim and merely dignified, as if standing on ceremony.<br />Each package portrait faces a page with a blessedly brief paragraph of odd facts, high-flown hooey and grammatical lapses (one wonders about the editing here; the first error, although admittedly minor, occurs in the very first line of the introduction). By hooey I mean insider designer prattle like 'the five-sided label . . . represents the five grape varietals used in the blend.' To me, symbolism fails when the designer has to explain it. Especially because this selfsame label clearly lists not five but &lt;four>. Or 'A separate aureate banner proclaims the wine's reserve pedigree.' 'Aureate'? Oh, you mean gold-colored or gold-tone? 'Banner'? Oh, that's the tacky little strip made to resemble, complete with nail holes, the brass title tags found on ancient picture frames. Frankly, a designer still using such old-hat stuff in 2000 has more reason to blush than to boast.<br />One important point that does come through is that good design isn't simply \\"dreamt up\\" but discovered and developed from facts and artifacts specific to each project. A good example is the elegant Lewelling label, inspired by the 19th Century calling card of the winery's founder. Another is Whitehall Lane's, based gloriously on the melted-crayon artwork of the winery owner's three-year-old daughter.<br />Wine geeks will love this book and so will designers. Ordinary wine-drinkers will enjoy a quick riffle or two but then are likely to leave it on the coffee table and forget about it.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wines, spirits and travel.	2003-08-06

One is the \\"only in America\\" story. As a tale of great risk, many struggles and final triumph, it often succeeds. Far riskier is this, the dread second type: immigrant's child visits Old Country, returns gushing over colorful relatives, quaint folkways, impenetrable dialects, bewitching cuisine. This absolutely requires vigorous writing, narrative skill, insight and a venturesome spirit.<br />Pity Mark Rotella has none to offer. The month-long visit that makes up much of this book is spent mostly not with kin but with Giuseppe, a local entrepreneur. Giuseppe has a car, you see--but tRotella's free transportation comes in the form of Giuseppe's business trip. Thus Rotella explores Calabria, his ancestral region, with a postcard-salesman dunning deadbeat clients. Spontaneity dies here, and much of the month seems to pass in real time. On the rare occasions that Rotella is about to develop a chance meeting into something more, Giuseppe says \\"Sorry--gotta go!\\"<br />Rotella does no better on his own. He makes much of visiting Roccaforte, pretending it's important to hear its residents speak Greek. But he botches it, arriving at siesta time. The village is asleep, so he immediately leaves, mission unaccomplished. Likewise Santo Stefano, birthplace of a legendary regional Robin Hood whose name \\"every Calabrian mentions with pride.\\" In the town, the bandit's name draws a blank.<br />Rotella learns nothing and from such visits because his idea of research is proceed from ignorance and then ask random people random questions (e.g., What's with the mafia around here? or How come Calabria's still so poor and backward?). He never follows up, thus turning issues into small talk. Occasionally he tries to pump up some melodrama with auguries or omens or hints of \\"something\\" mysterious or threatening about to happen (at one point he fears kidnapping), but nothing ever does.<br /><br />These incidents are tame and lame, and so is the writing: flat, plodding, repetitive. He visits a pottery and finds it full of pottery; meets a potter and learns the pottery has \\"machines that had to be pedaled with the feet\\" (oh--you mean potter's wheels?). The potters, he says, have formed a pottery guild and paint their pottery in a style paralleling the pottery of Deruta, a town famous for pottery.<br />Elsewhere, old men stroll on their morning stroll, and his spicy sausage tastes spicy (\\"spicy\\" is about the limit of Rotella's culinary lexicon). There's a dental quality to such prose--it's numbing--but his forays into imaginative writing are worse: the brief historical sketch embodying Calabria as a woman is uncompromisingly vulgar. Other references to sex are equally crude.<br />His reporting is shaky. A relative is Masimo in one sentence and Masino in another; a restaurant unaccountably changes names; Alaric is both Goth and Visigoth. Such gaffes are often eliminated if writers self-edit, which prompts this question: If Rotella couldn't be bothered to read his own book (and his editor, if any, likewise), why should you?<br />Of course, Publishers' Weekly praised this book extravagantly and fulsomely. Possibly because Rotella works for Publishers' Weekly?<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on travel and wines and spirits,	2003-07-29

Books	2	26	32	N	N	Sabotaged by the Designer	As a long-time self-taught pizza chef--I've been struggling for 20 years or so--I'm always immediately attracted to any new book on pizzas. I keep hoping one of them will give me the secret of perfectly round disks of dough (mine usually resemble Australia) or, failing that, offer me fresh tips and little entertainment.<br />Pamela Sheldon Johns has worked hard at that, and to some extent she's succeeded. She's also been sabotaged by the pretensions of the person who designed her book.<br />Johns has done a good job of research; she's clearly gone to Naples instead of the Internet. And Naples is the font of real pizza. When I say \\"real\\" I am excluding those culinary crimes that come from franchise operations whose sole claim to fame is rapid delivery. I am also excluding that catastrophe known as \\"Chicago pizza,\\" which in truth is nothing more than \\"bread with glop baked on it.\\"<br />And so we learn about authentic ingredients--the right flour for the dough (and how to compensate for the fact that we can't get it here), the best tomatoes, the best cheese. We learn which kinds of pizza are now officially protected species in Italy (this is a complicated bit of legislation best left for Johns to explain). We get a good selection of nicely chosen recipes.<br />So what's to complain about? Well, the truth is this book is hard to read. Johns, like most cookbook writers (most specialists of any kind, for that matter) is not exactly a gifted stylist. OK, I can forgive the cheap trickery inspired by a too-long subscription to Writer Magazine (\\"Whipping in and out of the narrow alleys of Naples, weaving through traffic that blared a cacaphony of sounds, going down one-way streets the wrong way and against red lights, and amid the somewhat, and thankfully, incomprehensible words of the taxi driver slung out the window to his driving adversaries, I mustered the courage and vocabulary to ask . . . what is your favorite pizza?\\" I can even put up with \\"Of all the components [pizza crust] is the simple combination of flour, water, salt and yeast that makes it unique\\" (it comes so tantalyzingly close to making sense!). But so what? She tells us how to make really good pizza and doesn't waste much time in doing it.<br />The saboteur here is the designer, who believes books are to be looked at and admired rather than read and used. The photos are plentiful and attractive. The overall presentation is handsome. But it's hard to read. There's no excuse for using 8-point type (ordinary newspaper size) and for spacing the lines so far apart. The ink should be black, not wimpy gray. The ingredients lists are in eye-straining italics. And whenever possible, tiny italic captions are printed over dark backgrounds.<br />The reasons for this are 1) book designers like pretty, arty productions and 2) type interferes with their desperate, artsy pretensions. Useful type is legible: It tends to be large and black; it tends to be straight-up-and-down Roman, with serifs that contain the letters rather than let them bleed into the background. Type, in short, asserts itself because it is meant for the use and convenience of the reader. Type of the sort seen here--tiny, fussy, dim, vague--expresses the designer's self-regard--and his contempt for the reader.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wine and spirits, and travel.	2003-07-02

Frankly I've always wondered why people go crazy about the splendid leather goods available in Florence. Yes, they're stylish, well-priced and well made--but can you eat them? To each his own, however. You want to buy shoes and handbags, or go to museums--help yourself. When I'm in Florence, I'm going to eat. The only things I buy to take away is food I want to smuggle back into the U.S.<br />I go to Italy three to five times a year (and I'm always hungry), and Florence is one of the best cities forrestaurants, pizzerias, wine bars, specialty shops and gorgeous markets piled with fresh produce. I have lots of scribbled notes and crumpled business cards, but this book does a much better job. If I've succeeded in whetting your appetite, then grab this book before you go on your own trip. Emily Wise Miller is a good writer and an outstanding guide to the gustatory city. She hits the high spots but doesn't neglect the little-known spots that aren't smack downtown; she knows the regional specialties (the unsalted bread, the magnificent lard); she also remembers that some amongst us are vegetarians and health-food devotees. And when she's got you positively salivating, she closes her book with chapters on cooking schools and culinary tours. All you really need to do is check the photo facing the introduction. It shows a newspaper headline that freely translates as \\"Delicatessen Clerk Condemned! Sold Prosciutto Different from the One the Customer Asked For!\\" That alone  will give you an idea of how seriously Florentines take their food--and how well-tuned-in Emily Wise Miller is.

Americans in Paris--certainly there's no shortage of literature on that theme. The post-World Wat I &quot;lost generation&quot; of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and others produced work of their own and inspired others to ramble incessantly about them and their world. But another generation of Americans in Paris has been rather neglected--the crowd that occupied Paris post-World War II.<br />They come back to us in this annoying but compulsively readable first novel. Annoying because there are lots of faults here: inefficient plotting, excessive explication, contradictory or even impenetrable motivation--all the sins first-novelists commit in their desperate and unnerving struggle to juggle their way to the end of the tale. Compulsively readable because this author is no callow youth but a seasoned world traveler who writes of youth--mostly misspent--through the filter of mature years.<br />The characters are young and tolerable only to the young--smug would-be intellectuals ready to change the world, scholars desperate for something to be scholarly about, arty types with too much angst and too little talent, emotionally vacant bed-fellows good only at getting between the sheets (the terms &quot;emotionally unavailable&quot; and &quot;fear of committment&quot; were yet to be dreamt-up) and earnest college girls eager and even desperate to bury their midwestern roots with spadefuls of Parisian sophistication. They interact feverishly, emptily and destructively and are helpless to do otherwise: They are young and powerful; they are privileged and they have it all--and they don't know it. They do each other a lot of damage before learning any lessons.<br />What drives this book is the truth of these these people. They are as real as the Paris Lazarus so well describes (he clearly knows it as well as he loves it). And we share in the author's distant perspective of regret. Every mature reader will come face to face with painful memories of his own youthful foolery here, and if it's no worse than foolery, he'll count himself lucky.<br />And maybe we can forgive ourselves in time &quot;Youth is wasted on the young,&quot; Gorge Bernard Shaw said truly. Someone else said, just as truly, that it's better to waste your youth than do nothing with it at all.	2003-06-08
US	48778664	R3E6QPH93639AV	0374204772	370743267	Ultimate Fitness: The Quest for Truth about Health and Exercise	Books	1	139	171	N	N	It Sags in the Middle	By Bill Marsano. This book. like an exercise session, has a hopeful start, a bang-up finish and plenty of tedium in-between. And there are two things you should know right away: 1., it's not going to give you a fitness program and 2, the only person searching fvcor fitness here is the authors. It's about the myths, misconception of business of the fitness field.<br />A science writer for The New York Times, she starts well by demonstrating her journalistic response to Heart Waves, a new fitness program pitched by a puiblicist. It's a proprietary regimen--a product. You have to pay to participate at specific places. Suspicious--these things come along about as often as diet plans--Kolata investigates.<br />And what she finds is a lot of mumbo-jumbo about heart waves and natural rhythms that is designed to fleece the public. The program's creator has had his medical license lifted in New York and New Jersey; he is married to the CEO of the for-profit organization that is the program's biggest promotor; and the study proclaiming amazing results is pronounced poppycock by professional statisticians.<br />She ends well, too, closing with interesting and occasionally (wryly) amusing details about the history of weight-lifting and body-building (and their great rivalry); food supplements (generally useless; unaccountably, she's not up to date on ephedra, recently implicated in some deaths), and the business aspect of fitness. For example, she sees her daughter become a certified personal trainer, in less than two weeks, simply by buying an American Council on Exercise home-study guide (based on a book only 160 pages long!) and passing a multiple-choice test (price: $200)--without ever having trained anyone in her life. Want to become a Spinning instructor? You can earn certification (about $300) in a single day!<br />The middle sags, badly, because Kolata is an exercise junkie. I began to suspect as much when she discussed an early aerobics program that recommended personsin \\"very poor\\" condition (unable to run a mile in 12 minutes) should START getting fit by walking one mile in 13.5 minutes every day for five days. That, Kolata says, \\"does not sound particularly extreme.\\" I beg to differ.<br />I'm a \\"professional\\" walker--I've made numerous long-distance walks in England and Italy and published walking articles in major consumer magazines. I walk daily for transportaion in Manhattan. Family and friends generally refuse to walk with me--they can't keep up. And I'm doing only 3.5 mph; 4.5 is nearly one-third faster and a whole lot harder. I've done 4.5 on a treadmill, but only after weeks of training up, and it's exhausting. If you doubt me, head for the nearest high-school<br />track. It'll be 440 yards a lap, so four laps equal a mile. Take along a stop watch, water, and a friend with a cell phone that has 911 on speed-dial. Unless you're in top shape, you don't have a prayer.<br />In time, Kolata admits to her zealotry. She's hooked on Spinning, also a proprietary fitness product that is \\"taught\\" in \\"classes\\" by \\"instructors\\" for substantial fees. Spinning is based on the stationary exercise bike but practiced in small, dark rooms, accompanied by videos (Mount Everest is a Kolata favorite) and sometimes candles and deafening music. The basic mood is frenzy--she speaks of sessions so crazed that sweat puddled on the floor.<br />And once is not enough: Kolata drags us to one spinning class after another. Her writing is workmanlike at best, and she relies on the present tense, so there are no stylistic pleasures to lighten this section. She is simply fascinated with herself.<br />Other information from the middle section is helpful (if frustrating) and easily summarized. It's this: almost everything you have ever heard about exercise (speed training, slow training, interval training, weight-loss, body-sculpting, effects on longevity, general health and disease-resistance, nutrition, vitamins, heart rates, etc.) is false, unproven, unprovable, folklore, arbitrary or some combination thereof. Current best advice, she says, is to walk 20 minutes a day (it doesn't even have to be all at one time) five days a week (would it have been too hard to credit this? to say how fast?). That, current wisdom says, will get you in as good shape as exercise can--anything more has no real effect.<br />Therefore, if you're going to go the extra mile(s), Kolata says, there's only one reason to do it: enjoyment.	2003-06-08
US	48778664	R1LMWENN050SB6	0471251356	970495058	The Knight: A Portrait of Europe's Warrior Elite	Books	4	2	4	N	N	The M1-A1 Abrams of His Time	By Bill Marsano. In a time of J-DAMS, MOABs and other expressions of remote-control  super-power warfare, the notion of the medieval knight will seem quaint at best to many readers. On the other hand, the knight &lt;was> the decisive weapon on the battlefields of his time. Through generations of movies, comic books and fairy tale the knight has come down to us as a purely romantic figure. Alan Baker is here with this small book to rescue these great warriors from their bubblegum image.<br />This is a brief book, really no more than an essay for the entry-level history student, but enjoyable and informative nonetheless. Bakers gives us a clear-eyed view of how knights developed into an elite warrior class; how they trained and were armed; how they staged elaborate mock-combats--just as the Romans did in the Colosseum--to keep their skills sharp and their reputations high. For a taste of real warfare, Baker takes us through a well-organized history of the First Crusade.<br />This book is designed to whet your appetite, not satisfy it. It does the job well: Most readers will, I think, be eager to go deeper into the day of old when knights were bold.--Bill Marsano is a long-time enthusiast of military affairs.	2003-05-08

This book is for fun, although it does appear to be well researched (there are chapter notes, and they often refer to actual published sources, not websites and TV shows) and the author is an established writer on military affairs. It's the content that's fun--a likable and sometimes funny collection of oddball stories of foolery by Axis and Allies alike. The anecdotes--there are several dozen of them--run from one end of the war to the other. They include the US general who lost his pants on a secret mission; the German spy who was caught with a batch of secret plans--but got away when his captors simply forgot about him; the incredible shortsightedness of the British government about Bletchley Park (where the Enigma secrets were unraveled); and secret agents who bilked their masters of large sums of money for high times--and provided no intelligence whatsoever (Joe Stalin's son was among them). This is a brisk tour of the situation-comedy side or WWII, and the author's charmingly dated, almost archaic tabloid writing style only adds to the fun. Bill Marsano is a long-time WWII buff himself.	2003-05-04

The folding kayak or boat-in-a-bag is rare compared to rigid or hardshell kayaks--and a lot more expensive. But unlike those others, you &lt;can> take it with you. You can break it down into component parts, stuff the bits into one or two bags or even, in the case of the Feathercraft, a specially designed backpack with padded shoulder straps and a hip belt, and take it wherevever you're bound. That's the whole point: No more hoping to find kayak rentals at your destimnation. No more settling for whatever beat-up barges the renters happen to have on hand.<br />If that tempts you, then you need this book to help sort out the facts and fiction (are folders fragile? less efficient than rigids? less stable? etc.) and get a handle on the numerous makes and models, which vary considerably in price, weight, size and design. Diaz, who is a good writer and an enthusiast (he publishes the Folding Kayak newsletter), has done his homework, updating his 1994 first edition to include and critique several kayaks that are new to the U.S, market<br />That's a critically important part of this book: So far as I know, this is the sole source of independent information covering the whole category. But Diaz offers a lot more. He goes beyond the hardware to presnt a very good course in basic kayaking: instruction and skill drills, safety, navigation. sailing rigs, kayak camping, and repairs and maintenance. The Resources chapter alone (on books, guidebooks, magazines and newsletters, websites, dealer access and much more) will keep you busy all by itself.<br />In short, if you've got an itch to paddle, this book will help you make an intelligent choice and teach you what you need to enjoy it when you get out on the water.--Bill Marsano owns a Feathercraft Kahuna and has unfolded it numerous times in the U.S., Italy and France.	2003-04-23

Ordinaire Joe, who'd rather drink wine than talk about it, is here advised to flee: This book will bore him stupid. The Wine Geek is just the opposite; for him wine is an excuse to prattle about clonal selection and hints of toffee on the nose. He'll love this book--will take it to bed with him. It is a gold mine of tasting notes covering many decades and innumerable wines from most regions of the world. The emphasis is on France, with Germany a distant third (there is no second), Italy a distant fifth (there is no fourth) and everybody else reduced to odds and ends. There's lots of stuff on champagne and port, too--a quintessentially British slant.<br />Never mind: The author, Michael Broadbent, is British, and the British have always leant that way. He is also one of the Great Men of Wine: revitalizer of Christie's wine auctions since 1966, writer, advisor, globe-trotting taster and collector of anecdotes and memories. In Japan such a person is officially labeled a Living National Treasure.<br />That makes this book of value and interest to the third class of wine drinkers--the Sub-Geek (or perhaps wannabe) who recognizes that his enjoyment of wine can be enhanced by a little more knowledge of its history and traditions, its lore and learing, its famous places and personages. There's a lot of that in this book, and it's always modestly and charmingly delivered. The reader must patiently winkle it out, however. It's all wrapped up in sidebars among those endless pages of tasting notes (about 500 of them) and is sometimes hidden inside individual tasting notes themselves.<br />This is the sort of book that will grace a shelf for a long time. There's no possibility of reading straight through it, and that's the wrong approach anyway. This book sits and waits for those late evenings with a last glass and an inquiring mind. It is to be leafed through for the pleasure of Broadbent's company.<br />--Bill Marsano is a wine and spirits writer who has won a James Beard medal and other awards.	2003-04-17

I am, after all, something of a fanatic about pizza--and about authentic, complete recipes in general. And then I remembered that I have two kids who have two sterling qualities: Both are  a) employed and b) living elsewhere. The big thing is to keep them that way. So fars as a) is concerned I'm helpless, but for b) I'm going to enlist the aid of this book.<br />Increasingly we live in an age when more and more people--especially young people--think cooking is something only their parents do, and when they grow tired of warming up take-out Chinese in the microwave, they start inviting themselves to dinner. Partly it's the fault of parents who didn't involved kids in the kitchen in the first place, so consider this book the make-up course.<br />Anyone who hasn't cooked, doesn't cook or thinks he can't cook can and should take this book of clear, simple, easily followed recipes and go to school on it. OK, there are lots of simple and simple-minded recipes like hot-salsa cheese dip and sloppy joes, but there's lots of other stuff they should have learnt about much earlier: tapenade, for example, Indian chicken, pork tenderloin. In short, dishes originating in actual civilizations, not marketing campaigns. In not too much time the user of this book will become competent at the very least, and he'll save a bundle over the cost of take-out. Whether he actually finds himself awakening to the delights of serious cooking and eating--that's another story. For now I'll be happy if my kids--who'll be getting their copies pronto--will progress to the point that I am at least once in a while able to dine at their apartments because they're not ashamed to invite me and I'm not afraid to accept.

Jo Bettoja (pronounced bet-TOY-a) went to Italy from<br />Georgia in the early 1970s as a model; she stayed to marry and become one<br />of the great ambassadors of Italian cooking. By now she's a kind of<br />culinary-cultural monument.<br />This is her latest and most delightful book--it fails to get a fifth star<br />through no fault of her own--because it focuses on Roman cooking (the fad<br />for the rather overrated Tuscan is abating at last) and because it is so<br />personal. You can feel it from her opening sentence: \\"My home is in Rome,<br />not far from the Trevi Fountain, just a short walk to the marketplace.\\"<br />Isak Dinesen's \\"I had a farm in Africa\\" is another memorable opener, but<br />with Jo you know you're going to eat. And she takes you right to her<br />marketplace, and through Roman traditions and foibles and lore, while<br />piling on the recipes.<br />Which are not all Roman, by the way. Romans have, over the years,<br />grudgingly admitted that some other Italians can cook, at least a little,<br />and so what we have here are real Roman recipes and adopted Roman recipes.<br />Pastas are especially abundant because no Italians are so crazy about pasta<br />as Romans. There's also a nice selection of egg dishes (legacy of Ancient<br />Rome) and fritti misti or mixed fries, a more modern Roman passion.<br />In the tradition of cookbrook writers of her era, Jo doesn't discuss wine,<br />so allow me to recommend Rome's white, light and beguiling Frascati, which<br />entranced Americans during the postwar \\"sunny Italy\\" tourist boom. Back<br />then (the 1960s), Frascati was merely popular; today it's a quality wine.<br />Look for Fontana Candida's Santa Teresa and Terre dei Griffi; Villa<br />Simone's Vigneto Filonardi and Vigna dei Preti; Falesco's  Vitiana; Colle<br />Picchioni; and Conte Zandotti's San Paolo.<br />So--why no fifth star? Poor design, deserving of a sound smack or two with<br />a wooden spoon. No, make that a rolling pin. Thinking to introduce color to<br />the pages, the designer chose a light mustard-yellow for many of the recipe<br />headings. Sorry, but it tends to blend in and so is hard to read. The<br />ingredients lists use a smallish italic that also fades. The body type is a<br />fuss-budget's dream, distracting with its silly, swishy little details.<br />Forty years in publishing have taught me that type's job is to convey<br />information legibly and easily, not to call attention to itself.<br />By the way: Some travelers may recognize the name. That's because Jo is the<br />wife of Angelo Bettoja, owner of one of Rome's finest hotel groups. Their<br />five family-run hotels, centrally located and well priced, are, like this<br />book, full of Roman warmth.<br />--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wine and spirits, travel and<br />other subjects.	2003-03-17

The centennial of flight has given us a spate of Wrighteous books this year, but few can match this one for expert knowledge and for pleasurable reading. Heppenheimer is an aviation expert and writer who has covered the ground exceedingly well. Most important, he avoids the folkloric view of the Wrights as a couple of plucky, red-cheeked mechanics who somehow kicked an airplane into being for a lark. They were, in fact, a pair of solid and serious young Midwestern businessmen who looked the part: Even in the workshop they customarily wore jacket and tie. They flew with their hats on. Generally they resembled a couple of bankers who are about to turn down a loan application. Beyond that, they were not merely mechanics but natural-born engineers and self-taught scientists who observed, studied, tested--and learned from their mistakes as well as their successes. Most of us have heard the 'story' of the Wright Brothers--this book helps us comprehend the astonishing magnitude of their achievement, which took them less than five years, working part-time and paying their own way.<br />Heppenheimer brings a lot of color into his story--the Wrights and others are revealed to us as human beings rather than icons--and he goes far afield, too, bringing us the stories of those others who preceded and competed with the Wrights. The result is a nicely rounded saga of man's long struggle to progress from wishes to wings. He also answers a question people often forget to ask: The Wrights produced the first man-carrying powered airplane in 1903; they set the world on its heels when, in 1908, they went to France for their first large-scale public demonstrations (before an extremely skeptical audience)--so how was it that they faded so quickly from the scene? I won't reveal the answer here (though I will suggest that the facts seem to pre-figure the later struggle between the Apple and the PC). And I will strongly urge you to read this book.	2003-02-17

The deal fell through. The designer was willing to co-operate, but only up to a point. He just couldn't bring himself to give the magazine his \\"signature\\" outfit. No; that was too much--he would not give his signature creation to what he called \\"that comic.\\"<br />It was not ever thus, as amply and inspiringly proved by Eleanor Dwight's biography of Diana Vreeland, that grandest of grande dames.<br />Diana Vreeland was a homely girl born into a beautiful family; in fact, her mother once told her, \\"It's too bad . . . that you are so extremely ugly.\\" Her response was a program of self-improvement. Dwight says \\"she emulated her classmates in how to dress; she worked on becoming tidy, enlarging her vocabulary, improving her manners.\\" Eventually, having not found the ideal girl to model herself upon, she decided, \\"I shall be that girl.\\"<br />If her mother exaggerated, it is nevertheless true that Vreeland was definitely not beautiful or even pretty. She was plain at best. But that was merely the surface nature gave her to re-make, and re-make it she did. She made herself original, arresting, witty, slightly madcap and rather amazing. She didn't have mere fashion--she had style, her own sensibility. By the time she took over the top spot at Conde Nast's Vogue, in 1963, she had been many years at Harper's Bazaar, where she had re-invented the job of fashion editor. At Vogue, she re-invented fashion magazines, hiring and nurturing (and occasionally driving crazy) the very best photographers and sending them and models to shoot in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. She also sent astonishing and urgent memos to her staff. One read simply, \\"Bring me shoes with chains on them.\\" Another said all of the staff should wear bells at the office. Fashion editor Carrie Donovan explains: \\"You know the sort of bells. Bells little kittens wear so they don't get lost in closets.\\" So they all bought and wore little bells immediately and, Donovan says, \\"By the time she came in, we were all walking around with bells on. She pretended she didn't notice anything.\\"<br />She &lt;did> appear to notice everything else and to express it inimitably: \\"Pink is the navy blue of India! The best thing about London is Paris! Without emotion there is no beauty! The only real elegance is in the mind. If you've got that, the rest comes from it. Never fear being vulgar, just boring.\\"<br />She did not shrink from spending Conde Nast's money, though in time Conde Nast did, and in 1971 she was abruptly fired.

Craig Nelson, who would rescue the Doolittle Raid from oblivion, is an odd choice for the job. Despite parents who were both involved in WWII aviation and who &quot;filled my childhood with stories of daring raids [and], secret missions,&quot; Nelson says, &quot;I didn't know a thing about it.&quot; Astonishing--still, writing on a clean slate, unencumbered by what everyone else has written and said, can be insightful and fresh. That's something Nelson should bear in mind next time.<br />There are good things here--the words of the 16 bomber crews themselves, their wives and sweethearts, and other participants. They make fascinating reading from beginning to end--the hasty, secretive training; the daring if slightly hare-brained idea itself (launching B-25 bombers from an aircraft carrier was a first, and the crews had practiced only on land); the raid itself; the crews' subsequent and usually succesful evasion of the Japanese after landing in China. There are harrowing tales from prison by crewmen who were captured and brutally mistreated, and follow-ups on the flyers' later combat service and postwar lives. Almost all of this material comes from archives or published sources. There's little new here, but 60 years after the fact that's understandable: Nelson says one of the surviving raiders died even as he was arranging an interview); Never mind: The raiders' own words tell most of the story and tell it well for those with &quot;entry level&quot; interest.<br />Unfortunately, a lot of the book is written by Nelson himself, and he isn't much of a writer, what with his clunky prose style (the aircraft carrier is a &quot;giant city of steel&quot; and a &quot;steel behemoth&quot;) and frail grasp of idiom (radio tubes &quot;warmed into gear&quot;). He often strays far from his point (really, German U-boats are not germane to this story). To push his claim that the raid was America's &quot;first victory.&quot; Nelson prefers cheerleading to facts. First, it was a success but not a victory--it was a hit-and-run raid plain and simple. Second, it wasn't even the first raid: The Navy had been attacking Japan's Pacific bases for months before Doolittle's raid. Nelson's failure to even mention those raids is inexcusable. He adds comic-book touches--prattling about &quot;flyboys&quot; and &quot;bell bottoms,&quot; calling bombers &quot;egg layers,&quot; torpedos &quot;eels&quot; and ships &quot;tin&quot;--and a whiff of the locker room, too: Doolittle, Nelson says, had &quot;balls the size of your head&quot; (each? both?) and &quot;balls of steel.&quot;<br />The factual errors are minor technical slips, but their sheer quantity suggests ignorance, haste and poor research by Nelson, and negligence by his editor. Nelson's B-25s have &quot;steel fuselages&quot; and &quot;diesely&quot; engines that are &quot;turbines&quot;; a take-off run is a &quot;taxi,&quot; and they could outrun Japanese Zeroes. Which is more ludicrous, Nelson's &quot;Klondike mecca of Nome&quot; or his claim that the Wright Brothers' fourth flight (852 feet) was &quot;shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747&quot;? The book lists about 300 sources, but many seem irrelevant &quot;padding&quot; (such as &quot;Ethnic Narcissism and Infertility in Japan&quot;), and one-third seem woefully unauthoritative--they're nothing more than TV shows, press clippings and websites. Was Nelson concerned with getting the story right--or just getting it written?	2003-02-02

As a native New Yorker and a long-time resident of midtown Manhattan, I'm often asked to recommend a &quot;nice, good, inexpensive&quot; hotel. Bad idea! I live here, and although I do keep a short list in my head, I've never actually stayed at the hotels and know very little about them. After all, nice, good and inexpensive are flexible terms whose definitions vary widely. And since your definition is the only one that counts,  don't call me--get a guide. This guide. It's well-organized and thorough, covering not only Manhattan but the 'outer boroughs' (The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and even Staten Island) as well, and it's easy to use. The outer boroughs are especially important. Although most people want to visit Manhattan, it's worth remembering that those 'outer' boroughs are but a few minutes away, in most cases, by bus or subway. OK, from Staten Island you have to take a ferry--but it's a terrific scenic ride, and it's free besides.<br />Lisa Mullenneaux rates hotels (one to five stars) in categories running from Bare Essentials to Full Services, then proceeds to a helpfully large number of sub-categories: First come value for money, cleanliness, guest services and security. Then she gives you all the dope required for an informed choice: rates; number of rooms (and whether the hotel has private baths or shared baths or both), in-room amenities (TV. hair dryers and such), whether there's an on-premises bar and/or restaurant; hotel parking and the kind of clientele you're likely to run into (tourists, businessmen, etc.). Phone and fax numbers, e-dresses and websites, and cancellation policies are included, as well as any special group discounts (e.g., for AAA and AARP) and wheelchair-accessibility. And after each checklist, Mullenneaux provides a thumbnail description that gives an idea of the 'flavor' of the guest experience.<br />This is the best coverage of New York's low-cost hotels that I've ever seen--miles better than you'll get by calling the city tourist bureau, for example. A half-hour's perusal of this book will save you money, avoid disappointment and quite possibly be the making of your New York vacation.	2003-01-18

Still, it's a good read. If you (like most of us) can't afford truffles but (like some of us) are still entranced by them, this books counts as 'armchair dining.' And if you can afford these gems, this book will help you buy intelligently. Not only are there many different kinds of truffle but these days 'counterfeit' truffles--second- or third-raters dragged in from Hungary and China--have been sneaked onto the market. The lore you need to to tell them apart (and what to do with them when you buy) is here presented by Rosario Safina, president of Urbani USA, the world's largest truffle importer. Safina and his co-auther, Judith Sutton, do a good job of presenting both information and recipes. Apart from genuinely useful information, they also impart some truly strange facts. Considering what truffles fetch on the market today, is it not strange for example that not so many years ago people were ashamed to eat them? They were poor folks' food--ugly, strong-smelling fungi hunted out by dogs and dug up from underground. Well, there was a time when New Englanders felt the same way about another poverty dish--lobster.	2003-01-18

It's big, sprawling, richly illustrated and full of detail--you can lose yourself in it for hours at a time, and go back to it often. The whole of flight's crowded century is covered from the Wright Brothers to space vehicles, with two world wars (plus Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm), barnstorming, the growth of civil aviation and everything else in-between, plus a chapter on the \\"pre-flight\\" pioneers who dreamed or experimented before the Wrights. The page layouts are handsome, the illustrations big, plentiful and colorful, and the text is well-organized. Individual chapters cover specific periods; within them, fascinating developments and people are covered in sidebars. That approach gives full coverage without getting the general text bogged down, and it allows tight focus on some of the many personalities who have gone with the wings. (Yes, Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart are still familiar names--but most people will need to be reminded of the purple-jumpsuited Harriet Quimby, and Bessie Coleman, and the Red Eagles, among others.)<br />I give this five stars, but just barely. DK books are heavily design-oriented--page layouts must blend innumerable design items (text, illustrations large and small, captions, schematics and sidebars) into harmonious compositions. DK usually succeeds, but often at the reader's expense by sacrificing legibility. For example, captions in small italics are always hard to read, and especially so when laid over colored backgrounds or photos. The schematic indicators identifying specific airplane features are occasionally misplaced. The editing is a bit sloppy: \\"blooded\\" and \\"bloodied\\" are not synonyms, and there are many dangling modifiers--elementary grammatical lapses that should have been corrected. The proof-reading isn't up to snuff either. In onecase a display quote contains a typo (inexcusable in large type); moreover, the quote seems distorted from its text version. One sidebar simply ends in mid-sentence: The text was too long for the space, and someone forget to cut it to fit. And the South African RAF ace \\"Sailor\\" Malan spelled his given name Adolph, not Adolf. DK owes readers rather more attention to detail.	2003-01-15

By Bill Marsano<br /><br />Take heed: This enjoyable and informative book is those who love words and ingenuity; all others stay clear. Author Allan Metcalf, professor of English and executive secretary of the American Dialect Society proposed in 1990 that--just as Time magazine had its Man of the Year--the ADS should<br />elect a New Word of the Year. Done and done! This book looks at the winners (and many others) and what became of them; it encourages readers to create new words of their<br />own devising and suggests criteria for success.<br />And success has been mixed, not only for ADS honorees but for other new words (officially called 'neologisms'). For example, my own creations. I produced \\"oldveau riche\\" a dozen years ago, but seldom have opportunity to use it. Currently I'm struggling to popularize \\"e-dress,\\" which is certainly more efficient than \\"e-mail address.\\" The first ADS winner,<br />\\"bushlips\\" (for insincere political rhetoric), stemmed promisingly from President George W. Bush's \\"Read my lips: No new taxes,\\" but, like Bush's promise, it went nowhere. \\"Frankenfood,\\" a recent American coinage for<br />genetically modified food, is popular only in Britain. \\"Scofflaw,\\" Metcalf says, was selected in 1923 from 25,000 contest entries. It's used for people who ignore parking tickets but was created specifically for illegal<br />drinkers during Prohibition, and it was thought to carry such a sting that it would shame them into reform. Fat chance!<br />Metcalf discusses other semi-successes. Gelett Burgess invented the very useful 'blurb' and 'bromide,' but their &lt;meanings>  were supplied by others. Lewis Carroll invented lots of neologisms that remain pleasing (e.g., \\"'twas brillig, and the slithy toves, did gyre and gimble in the wabe . . . .\\") but are so obscure no one uses them. The champion failure would seem to be Rich Hall, said to be a comedian, who in the 1980s<br />published several paperback books full of  \\"sniglets\\"--words, he said, that don't exist but should. The examples cited by Metcalf show why they've all disappeared: They're desperate, useless and ruthlessly unfunny.<br />Shakespeare, Metcalf says, is the all-time champion. Words and usages he produced four centuries ago are still in common use; his instinct for the right word at the right time was uncanny. Not so mine. A couple of years ago I came up with 'three-wuh' in the hope of getting around 'www' which, as someone else had noted, is the only word to have three times as many<br />letters as it does syllables. Fat chance again: www itself has almost disappeared because, being at the head of &lt;every> web address, no one needs to say it any more--or bothers to.<br />So, creative readers, buy this book and study it. Once you and your neologisms had almost no chance of success unless you wrote for newspapers and magazines. and were thus able to spread them around. But now you have the internet to spread the word, as it were. Use (and explain) your neologisms often in e-mails--which should be sent to everyone for whom you have an e-dress. Professor Metcalf included.	2003-01-02

If you're the sort of person whose devotion to cookies stops at a stack of Oreos, you may as well go somewhere else: This book is not for you unless you're daring enough to buy it and give it to someone who &lt;bakes&gt; cookies. At that point your horizons will be enlarged.<br />Tish Boyle, of the magazines Chocolatier and Pastry Art &amp; Design, knows her cookies, and she's put about 250 recipes for them in this neat, well-organized book: one to a page, clear instructions, easy to read. All kinds of cookies: drop, rolled, hand-formed, bar types and piped/molded types. Also icebox cookies (aka 'refrigerator' today) and filled cookies. Plain and decorated cookies. There's even a recipe here for Ginger Quakes made with (optional) bacon fat--not a lot but just enough to really make a difference. And recipes for pet cookies like Seafood Cat Cookies and Miss Kitty Dog Biscuits.<br />There are also plenty of handy tips, such as not using a nonstick pan when baking madeleines (they'll be over-browned). Here's my own tip: Get the kids involved and start them young. It's good for them to learn how to do instead of buy, and real home-made cookies are so good they'll be less likely to fall for the kind of junk that stores offer in cellophane packages.	2002-12-21

Some wanted the simple life; some saw profits.<br />Others sought to beat the French at their own vinous game, and a few<br />succeeded.<br />Napa wines won a famous 1976 tasting (the French were apoplectic), mightily<br />boosting reputations and profit potential. Soon, bottom-line worshippers<br />corporatios marginalized mere sweat-equity farmers in muddy boots and<br />pickup trucks, moving  James Conaway to record the loss of innocence in his<br />best-seller \\"Napa\\" (1990). Now his fine sequel--told through heroes and<br />villains--finds America's Eden in crisis.<br />Tsunami tourism (5 million visitors a year) is bad, the new-wave investors<br />worse: dot-commers, lawyers, real-estate moguls and others skilled in<br />pulling fortunes from the air and convinced of their right to do as they<br />pleased, the law be damned. Vulgar McMansions profane lovely hillsides,<br />spoiling the grand views for everyone else. Arrivistes craving the cachet<br />of their names on top-dollar labels spend recklessly on vineyards dozered<br />and dynamited into ever-steepening slopes. These grow fine grapes, but<br />their runoff muddies Napa's river and threatens its watershed and wildlife.<br />The wines themselves are obscured between [price]\\"monster cabernets\\" and<br />\\"fruit bombs\\" and cheap stuff--often not even made from Napa grapes--meant<br />to strip-mine tourists. Pretentiousness thrives: Napa Valley now has an<br />\\"Office of Protocol.\\"<br />Existing legal controls might have limited damage had county officials<br />bestirred themselves. They don't, and so zealots force the issue: Wine Guys<br />vs. Enviros. Reasonable people capable of compromise can't stop the slide<br />into unproductive rancor. Fulminative rhetoric draws neo-Prohibitionists<br />attacking \\"alcohol farms,\\" ex-urbanites utterly ignorant of agriculture,<br />and radicals demanding an end to all local regulations, even seeking<br />exemption from state environmental laws. In the background real-estate<br />developers dry-wash their hands at the prospect of turning incredibly<br />valuable vineyards into astronomically valuable housing lots.<br />The result is one of those \\"mother of\\" lawsuits. It would be unfair to say<br />who wins because Conaway, a brisk and vivid writer, maintains suspense to<br />the end. But it is fair to say it accomplishes little and may mean ruin<br />later on.<br />Eden--it's not a pretty picture.	2002-10-04

It's an indication of the nation's culinary collapse that a book of comfort-food recipes should be necessary. But it is. Under a thin veneer of fancy-food devotees there lies an enormous population of people who don't know how to cook. Most of these people haven't hung around the kitchen as kids, learning by osmosis and by occasionally helping--for one reason or another, Mom hasn't been in the kitchen much. She's been at work, by necessity or by choice, and the old-fashioned 'home-ec' courses haven't been offered in schools for decades. These days, 'comfort food' for many people is Chinese take-out, and TV commercials push the idea that Mom is a great cook if she can warm up pre-packaged frozen dinners. So now people who are brave enough to enter a kitchen and try something more challenging than the microwave oven need a recipe book for something so simple as a grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich.<br />This book is a good place to start. ... The recipes are well-presented and clearly explained, one to a page. They span a wide variety of cuisines and styles, from pasta and that grilled sandwich to stir-fries and spicy chicken wings. All are simple and some are extremely simple--anyone who can read can handle them. And ought to. Cooking is a skill everyone should have. It will make you feel good to be able to do it--and you'll save a fortune on take-out food and frozen dinners, which are a lot more expensive than most people think. So--this book will save you money, teach you an important skill, give you a little more independence and boost your self-esteem. I don't see how you can resist.	2002-10-01

Why so many cookbooks these days? One reason is that anyone can troll the Internet for a few hours and download enough recipes to make a book with very little effort; some \\"authors\\" apparently do just that. Not, however, Fred Plotkin, who has produced here not a book but a feast that demands the attention of any serious cook or food-lover.<br />Fred Plotkin's field is Italy--all Italy (as in \\"Italy for the Gourmet Traveler,\\" which you should order) and the obscure and less-known regions of Italy, as in this book, which is centered on Friuli-Venezia Giulia, high in the northeast, and in his previous one on Liguria (order that too, while you're at it), the superb \\"Recipes from Paradise: Life and Food on the Italian Riviera (order that, too). These regions--their very existence--will come as a surprise to many Americans, who have been led by decades of relentless and superficial media coverage to believe that Italy is Tuscany and that Tuscany is only the area between Florence and Siena.<br />Plotkin doesn't strip-mine a region and bung a lot of recipes into a book. He explores and absorbs it. He visits Italy frequently and has often lived there for extended periods, sharing the life of regions that call out to him. In this case, he writes--elegantly, feelingly--of a region he has known for more than 25 years. For this reason, people and places come alive as welcoming presences.<br />Recipes? There are recipes galore here, and you will be happy (I hope) to know that that are not the tired (and overhyped) Tuscan retreads. With its Adriatic coast, this region was deeply involved in the Spice Trade at its height, and so you will find many spices used here, some of which (cumin, for example) will come as a surprise.<br />I recommend this book for cold winter days. It'll warm you just to read it, and then you can start cooking too.<br />Bill Marsano is a James Beard Award-winning writer on wine, spirits and food.	2002-09-06

It's a very personal effort, an hommage to his late father, who was born in the little town of Mussomeli in central Sicily and who came to the U.S. in 1905. The elder Baratta was a man of strong opinions; for example, he didn't consider many mainland Italians to be Italians at all or, as he put it, &quot;anything north of Palermo is Swiss.&quot; The younger Baratta minces no words either, and often in this book he and his father combine delightfully: &quot;Cauliflower is a much-hated vegetable in this country [the U.S.], yet it need not be so. It is usually boiled and accompanied by small groans. A non-Italian guest once watched with interest the respect my father paid this detested food. Her curiosity broke down her ancient reservations, and she tried a piece. The result was near-disbelief in the lively flavor. The Old Man flatly pointed out (indifferent to the insult he offered the poor girl's family), 'If it had been prepared correctly, you would have always liked it!' So much for polite chatter. He remained unrepentant all his life.&quot;<br /> There's much more of the same in these pages, and plenty of recipes--many of them unusual and delightful (Sicilian cooking is ine of the richest and most varied cuisines in the Mediterranean basin). The pages are large, the type is clear, and there's only one recipe to a page. So whether you try the cauliflower recipes--or the cardoons or the meat and seafood dishes--you're in for a treat. Still, the best part of this book is the salty talk of two Sicilian gentlemen--the one who wrote it and the one who inspired it.	2002-04-08

And who could blame him? Writing a weekly column year in and year out is an exhausting grind. Still, I'm awfully glad he took it on, and gladder still that some of his columns--from the past three decades or so--have been collected in this book. This is a book for the intelligent reader with an interest in wine; it is not for snobs and geeks. Its content is not poetry, for Prial is not a poet (as, for example, Gourmet magazine's Gerald Asher is). But he is first and foremost a reporter, and that's what's wanted more often than not when it comes to informative prose about wine (anybody can scribble stuff about 'hints of chocolate on the nose,' and far too many do). What Prial provides is the literary version of a good, sturdy country red, full of pleasure and easy to like. This isn't a &quot;wine course&quot;; there are no Qs and As and lists to memorize. &quot;Decantations&quot; is instead a stroll through the vineyards with a well-informed observer who's happy to pass on a little of what he's learned down the years. Prial ranges widely, writing of wine's notable families (the stately Rothschilds, the elegant Antinoris, the vivacious, New York-born Benzigers); some colorful titans (from Walter Taylor, the self-styled Baron of Bully Hill to Alexis Lichine, the Russian-born American who revolutionized the French wine business, whether the French liked it or not). Want some insight into the foolish devotion to vintages--or the equally foolish devotion to the tyrannical Bordeaux Classification of 1855? Want the lowdown on Beaujolais Nouveau? Prial clues you in, and briskly, too: One of the things a reporter learns is to keep it brief, and Prial does not ramble on. I could quibble a bit. There's not nearly enough here about Italian wines, and overall the book is TOO short--a mere 304 pages, including the index. But goodwine writers and good wines have this much in common: They leave you wanting more.<br />--Bill Marsano	2002-03-30

Most wine books, after all, skimp on photos (which are expensive to produce), and those they use are often pedestrian. Thus we seldom get a chance to see how beautiful is the world of wine-making. Here the photographer Charles O'Rear has traveled to many of the regions where the Cabernet grape is grown--Bordeaux, California, Chile, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Spain--to record and glorify the making of Cabernet from vine to bottle. There are plenty of panoramas here; vast views over endless vineyards are the bedrock of wine photography. But there are also lots of rewarding detail shots of pickers and their tools, winery interiors, grafting, and even the tally tokens used to record how much each picker has harvested. At one vineyard they are colored baskets; at another, plastic discs; at still another, ordinary clothes pins. All different, but all with the same meaning: They determine how much each picker is paid. These homely details, when added to the faces of the workers, invite you into the world shown in the vineyard panoramas. They're far more appealing that the inevitable \\"art\\" shots of wine glasses and barrel halls and ranks of bottles in a cobwebbed cellar.<br />The photos are generally so expressive it's not necessary to read the captions, which is a good thing. It seems to be a rule in picture books that captions must be made confusing and inconvenient wherever possible for the reader. Also, anyone who wants to actually read about wine is advised to go elsewhere. In picture books, the text is usually scanty and used as mere filler, and that is the case here.<br />--Bill Marsano	2002-03-06

The powerful government outlaws the irregulars and<br />those who shelter them. A colossal blood-letting ensues.<br />If you're reminded of the current War on Terrorism, you're right--but off<br />by about oh, eight centuries, because this book is about 13th Century<br />Languedoc (now part of France), where the Roman Catholic Church waged holy<br />war on heretical Christians called Cathars (a.k.a. Albigensians). Caught<br />in-between were the Languedocians. Although mostly Catholic, they were<br />tolerant of the Cathars (and Jews, too).<br />The Church, however, was not: Catharism threatened its spiritual and<br />temporal power. When attempts to convert the Cathars failed, the Pope<br />launched a Crusade--against Christians. The warfare would continue for a<br />century and make \\"medieval\\" a modern synonym for unspeakable and barbaric<br />cruelty. It began in 1209 with an assault by tens of thousands of crusaders<br />against Beziers, a town of 20,000 that refused to betray its 200 or so<br />Cathars. Distinguishing Catholic from Cathar meant nothing to the<br />crusaders' leader, whose order was \\"Kill them all. God will know his own.\\"<br />And so everyone--heretic and believer, man and woman, adult and child--was<br />slaughtered. The town was burnt to the ground.<br />That set the tone for a war that brought out the best and worst in men and<br />institutions. The worst combined bribery, betrayal, torture and maiming,<br />rigged trials, institutional and private terrorism, and legalized murder.<br />The best was the inspiring courage and compassion of ordinary decent<br />Languedocians who, in town after town, refused to turn on their Cathar<br />fellow citizens, even though they well knew the consequences.<br />Partly because of that courage, the crusade dragged on too long toachieve<br />total success. In fact, Catharism was reviving when the Church finally<br />unleashed the Inquisition. Combining religious zeal with Germanic<br />efficiency, unstoppable as the Gestapo of our own time (to which it bears<br />an uncomfortable resemblance), the Inquisition finished what the crusaders<br />had begun: The Cathars were extirminated, almost to the last man.<br />Stephen O'Shea, who moved to France to research this moving and instructive<br />tale, is an excellent writer. He does a superb job of keeping his narrative<br />moving quickly and informatively along despite innumerable obstacles.<br />Dynastic marriages, complicated alliances and betrayals, the fact that<br />several of the major figures bear similar names--these do not stall him.<br />With muscular prose and even wit he lays out the issues and breathes life<br />into people and a sect long dead. This is popular history at its best. In<br />its ability to seize the reader it reminds me of the sort of books Barbara<br />Tuchman (\\"The Guns of August\\") and Stanley Loomis (\\"Paris in the Terror\\")<br />wrote some four decades ago.<br />--	2002-02-18

But they're missing an awful lot. Wine isn't merely a drink but a whole world of people, places, history and culture, and those are things most wine drinkers remember far longer than taste. For them, this new edition--the fifth--of Hugh Johnson's wine atlas (first published in the 1970s) will be a treasure. It now has a co-author in Jancis Robinson, who is Britain's high priestess of wine. Maybe that description is a little intimidating; what I mean is that she know a tremendous amount about wine, and what I want most of all to convey is that she shares her knowledge and enjoys sharing it. She'd rather inform than impress; she wants you to have as good a time as she does. And she and Johnson have given you, in this book, a passport for that purpose.<br />This book gives you noting less than the whole world of wine on the printed page. There are maps, of course, maps beyond counting of the fabled wine regions of France and of the stunning wine regions of Italy, surely the most beautiful of wine countries as well as the sources of many of the greatest bargains. Wine's New World is well represented too: the U.S.,  which is no surprise (and Canada, which to many people is) as well as Chile and  Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa. Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and the former Soviet Republics are covered--they're making comebacks after years of awful &quot;socialist wine-making&quot; under Communism. And the list goes on. Even Japan and England are here--they do, after all, make more than sake and beer.<br />There's a wealth of background information, too, on everything from vines to the mystique of what the French call &quot;terroir,&quot; storing and serving, matching wine with food, the many grapes that make so many wines (in Italy, for example, the Sangiovese grapes is the core of half a dozen winess in Tuscany alone), and of course how wine is actually made. And all of it is readable and enjoyable,  making this a complete wine course at a bargain price. Put a log on the fire, grab a glass, pull a cork and settle down with this book. Choose an especially comfortable chair--odds are it'll be a long time before you're ready to get up.<br />--Bill Marsano<br />(The reviewer has won a James Beard medal for wine and spirits writing.)	2001-11-14

The price is low, the quality's high and the author, Jack Robertiello, has had a long career in the journalism of food and wine. He knows his stuff.<br />His subject is the Italian food of New York City, which means--with just a few exceptions--the best in this country, even this hemisphere (if you've ever tried Argentine or Chilean Italian cooking, you know what I mean). He divides New York City, wisely into several areas for the reader's convenience. First there is Manhattan, which is subdivided into neighborhoods also, thus putting the best and the most on display, conveniently formatted so it's easy to find out opening hours and days and time, which credit cards are or are not accepted, and so on. Information at your fingertips is the rule here. Then you come to the meat of each review, which ain't chopped liver. No snappy one-liners here, no &quot;witty&quot; and quick dismissals: the author actually discusses each establishment at a length that convinces you he's seriously studied it. Robertiello does have a sense of humor--he just doesn't use cheap laughs as a cover for shallowness.<br />From Manhattan he goes on to Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx, all of which have jewels that are missed by diners--and critics--who are afraid to cross the river. The only borough he's missed, it seems, is Staten Island, where there is a Sicilian vasteddi shack he needs to know about.<br />Restaurants are the main dish in this guide but far from the only one. There are also bakeries (some for pastry, some for bread), cafes, pizzerias, snackeries, food stores, butcher shops and joints. (A joint is a raffish sort of place whose charm usually escapes your friends, who think it's a dump.) He rates some on their overall cooking and others on the basis of specialties, which is important to folks who are, for example, eternally searching for the Best Pizza.He even has a 'best restaurant with music.' Such a place is normally to be shunned but the wordly-wise Robertiello knows full well that it can be a life-saver when you need to treat the in-laws to a memorable evening while ignoring them at the same time. A Top Ten list of Italian restaurants is provided but hardly necessary because the level of Italian food in the city is quite high. But his short courses on wine, pasta, olive oil and cheese will be of great help to neophytes.<br /><br />Civilized men can disagree, and I have to quibble over his estimates (too high) of Bruno Ravioli and Manganaro's Food. Maybe that's because I make ravioli myself and life almost nextdoor to Manganaro's. Neither am I convinced that coal cooks pizza better than wood. Those sre small matters: This book is the real deal.<br />--Bill Marsano<br />(Winner of a James Beard medal for his writing one wines and spirits, and several Lowell Thomas awards for travel writing.)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------	2001-11-12

It was a particular favorite in Britain because it had all the favorite elements of British myth-making: danger, daring and, best of all, failure. Scott ran second to the Norwegian Raold Amundsen at the Pole and there were lots of stiff-upper-lip fatalities. &quot;I'm just going outside,&quot; said one of the last to die, &quot;and I may be some time.&quot; Then he went outside and cheerfully, one presumes, froze to death.<br />Only in the last few years have clearer heads examined this story and brought some reality to it, mainly the hard-to-dismiss judgment that Scott was something of a twit who doomed his own adventure. Simultaneously those heads began to acknowledge the primacy of Ernest Shackleton's grand expedition to cross the Antarctice continent.<br />This too was a failure--the explorers never got onto the continent proper--but it turned into an epic of human survival and a glorous success, because not a single life was lost under the most horrific of circumstances.<br />The expedition's ship, Endurance, was trapped in the pack ice offshore for months; the party lived aboard it for months, then transferred to the pack ice when their ship was finally crushed and sunk. Eventually, when the pack cracked apart beneath their camp several times they made a daring escape to barren Elephant Island nearby, and from there Shackleton and some companions sailed a small boat several hundred miles across the world's most violent ocean to South Georgia Island, where there was a whaling station. When the weather forced them to come ashore on the wrong side of the island, Shackleton and one or two others managed to climb across the island's mountain range--which had never been done before, or even considered--and staggered, stumbled and even slid to safety. They were so battered and starved no one even recognized themat first. Eventually, Shackleton returned to Britain, then he returned to South American and organized--more than a year had passed by now--a rescue expedition to Elephant Island, where he picked of all the rest of his party.<br />This incredible story is welltold in &quot;The Worst Journey in the World,&quot; one of the greatest of adventure epics, but you have to see it to believe it--and now you can.<br />With Shackleton's expedition there was the pioneering Australian photographer Frank Hurley, one of the early masters of the camera. He didn't have handy little point-and-shoot cameras but heavy and cumbersome wooden box cameras using glass-plate negatives, and he took great risks to make many of his images.<br />This book at last assembles the bulk of Hurley's work, pulling together several hundred photos from widely scattered sources and displays them, together with examples of Hurley's earlier and later work, in a superb large-format gallery for the armchair explorer. It's a stunning work. You may not want to believe your eyes, but you'll have to.<br />--Bill Marsano<br />(The author is a travel writer and a devotee of exploration stories.)	2001-11-07

After covering all of the wine world in one book they have narrowed their focus in subsequent &quot;dummies&quot; books on red wine, white wine and champagne. Now focusing geographically, they tackle French and Italian wines in two new books. The French book will tell the tale here because French is the most daunting wine for teacher and student alike.<br />That because almost all French wines are named for places (regions, towns, chateaus) instead of the grapes they're made from, which is the practice in most other countries. Thus your Bordeaux could be made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and most often is--but one of the most famous and most expensive Bordeaux, Petrus, is made almost entirely from Merlot. Not that you'd know from the label. You want Chardonnay? The French make it by the long ton but rarely label it as such, preferring instead something like Puligny-Montrachet. Then there is the collection of &quot;cru&quot; classifications for individual estates. This apparent perversity actually reflects the French belief that &quot;where&quot; means more than &quot;what&quot;; that the native heath marks wine and other foods just as a local accent marks you and me.<br />That's why this book is the test: Can the authors penetrate and even elucidate this maze? To their credit and my amazement they can and do. They are wine experts but primarily wine educators. They know this stuff cold but as &lt;teachers&gt; want you to learn and love this stuff as much as they do.<br />In fewer than 300 pages they achieve a great deal--they encourage, instruct, dispel myths, point toward good buys, discuss changing wine-making styles, celebrate new discoveries and pretty much everything else except feed the hungry and clothe the poor.<br />So if you're interested in French wine or know someone who is, you'll bebetter of buying this book than almost any other. The price is great and the authors are good company--they can &lt;write&gt; as well as teach.<br />-------------------------------------<br />Bill Marsano is a contributing editor of Hemispheres, United Airlines' in-flight magazine, for which he frequently writes on wine.

All of a sudden winemakers everywhere were competing for customers everywhere, and for most of them that meant they had to improve quality, and fast. Italian winemakers responded and successfully to the challenge. They now produce some of the most esteems top-of-the-line wines in the world as well as an increasing nmber of wines that are real bargains (that is, you get &lt;more&gt; than you pay for). But too many wine writers have failed to keep up with this ar-reaching change, have failed to expand their horizons beyond France.<br />Not &lt;these&gt; writers. Authors of &quot;dummies&quot; wine books since &quot;Wine for Dummies&quot; in 1995, they have closely followed Italy's quality revolution, and so can point you to a world of pleasure you might otherwise miss.<br />After saying that much I'm in danger of repeating what I wrote in my review of the authors'&quot;FRENCH Wine for Dummies,&quot; published<br />simultaneously, so you should scamper right over to my review of that book for more details.

I simply call her the high wine priestess of Britain. That might seem intimidating, but fear not. For all her encyclopedic mind, Robinson delights in passing her knowledge on (as distinct from the kind of person who won't share for fear other people will know something too). Some wine writers like to bully and mystify their readers, but Robinson has her ego under control. She'd rather make new friends for wine than just about anything else except drink the stuff.<br />And so she is the perfect guide for learning &lt;how&gt; to taste: how to focus on and identify--and later describe--the layers of aroma and flavor wines contain; how to remember them so you can compare in the future; how to match them with food; how to get interesting insights from tea cups and a mouthful of toothpaste.<br />I said &quot;really short&quot; and I mean it. In the past two years I've seen a handful of books for wine beginners that ought to have been &lt;weighed.&gt; Robinson gives you about 200 pages--pretty small pages, too, with plenty of excellent and informative illustrations. Moreover, this book isn't necessarily for beginners. Most people &lt;haven't&gt; been taught how to taste effectively. And that means there are plenty of serious wine amateurs around who know a great deal about wine except how to taste it.<br />This book will open your eyes and reward your taste buds.<br />------------------------<br />Bill Marsano is a contributing editor of Hemispheres, United Airlines' in-flight magazine, for which he often writes on wines and spirits.

US	48778664	RDWP6L4HD2P0N	0767904478	683753064	Wine and War: The French, the Nazis, and the Battle for France's Greatest Treasure	Books	4	100	103	N	N	Wine and Remembrance	This is not a book about wine--it's actually a non-fiction historical thriller with wine as the prize. All you need to know about wine is what most people know: Wine is part of the French soul. It is not merely a drink or a product. It is more important than all the perfumes and fashions and cheeses put together. Even those funny cars the French make that look like vacuum cleaners. Nothing in American cultural life has similar status.<br />At the outset of World War II France suffered the shame and disgrace not of defeat but of total collapse. She had the world's largest army--one that gave the Germans pause, in fact-- and yet somehow was under the Nazi jackboot in about six weeks. Naturally, the Nazis set about to systematically loot the country.<br />Here I'd like to ask a question I've not seen asked before: the Nazis took it as written that they and their culture were absolutely superior to everyone else in the world. Why then their unbridled need to steal the cultural riches of all the nations they conquered? Some booty was sold to finance the war, but most of the cultural treasures--France's wines and artworks, for example--were stolen merely out of greed and jealousy.<br />When it came to looting France's wines, the Nazis were well-organized. They appointed experts called weinfuhrers to organize the theft, much of which was conducted under a charade of legality: The Nazis overvalued the mark, devalued the franc, closed all other export markets, told the producers what their prices would be and ordered them to sell the wine. Here Don and Petie Kladstrups unveil the amazingly inbred world of wine, in which everbody of importance seems to be related to, married to or employed by someone else of equal importance. As the authors show, this meant the weinfuhrers were sometimes as loyal to France as to Germany.<br />The winemakers resisted as often as they could and perpetrated many frauds on the Nazis. They saved a fair amount of their greatest wines and sold the Wehrmacht as much plonk as they could get away with. The Kladstrups tell how--and in doing so they have rescued a small but important piece of history. The New Europe leans toward institutional forgetfulness today--and so does France herself. Memories of collaboration intrude all too easily, and these are followed by nettlesome ambiguities and doubts. Ratting on your neighbor was collaboration, but so was trading with the Nazis--even when you had no choice. Marshal Petain, head of the Vichy government was condemned at war's end and DeGaulle hailed as a hero--but surely it was easier to be heroic in London?<br />There are a couple of minor factual errors and a couple of anecdotes that aren't credible, but most of this complicated but absorbing tale rings true. Some scenes the Kladstrups re-create are slyly amusing, a few are comic and many--the best of themn--are intensely moving. These were proud people, remember, whose faces were ground into the dirt by brutish conquerors every day. For five years they struggled desperately to save their lives and their families, their self-respect and their hope for a future.<br />It's a hell of a story.	2001-05-26

And that ridiculous subtitle--\\"A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted\\"--suggests the kind of soft-centered, caramel-dipped, high-fructose prose found in Harlequin Romances...<br /> This is not a gooey romance written by a birdbrain but a consistently engaging tale of a young Brit and her sister who take seasonal work harvesting olives in a little-known peasant village in a lesser-known region of Italy--and end up buying a houdse there.<br />The opening drags a bit. The author struggles with her pose as the bright young thing taking the traditional Brit's view of benighted foreign peasantry. Too pert by half, frankly. But what makes this book work is that the author observes closely, learns, and grows--grows up, too.<br />She began by thinking of her neighbors as jolly but backward folk who just love to feed people--and keep on feeding them. So typically Italian! Well, she gets over this; she begins to understand that these people actually know a thing or two and even know things she doesn't. As a result her prose calms down and her story moves along pretty briskly. There's humor and passion as she and her neighbors come to terms with each other--and as she increasingly becomes not merely a summer visitor but a person who comes to have some standing as a genuine member of her community.<br />The change occurs gradually through innumerable small steps (steps too small to mean much if taken out of context in a review) and one large event that can't be discussed because it would give away far too much. Look at it this way: We've had the sugary stuff of \\"Enchanted April\\" and the cold and cynical exploitation of \\"A Year in Provence.\\" Annie Hawes's story is different; it might even be what would happen to you or me.	2001-05-26

It's as good as Charles and Michele Scicolone's book &quot;Pizza Any Way You Slice It (also available from Amazon), and it is similarly packed with recipes, tips and advice. There are a couple of differences worth noting. Buonassisi is a scholar (in archeology) and a writer on many other subjects, and he naturally takes something of a scholarly approach here, providing a wealth of detail on pizza's origins and development. Gastronomically he goes further, providing an excellent chapter on what to drink with pizza: You can easily do better than just &lt;any old&gt; beer or wine, and his advice will improve your meal.<br />Finally, Buonassisi's recipe for basic dough uses bread flour only, rather than the Scicolones' blend of hard bread flour andsoft cake flour). Having put both recipes to the test--with excellent results--I'd advise buying &lt;both&gt; books and spending some adventurous hours in the kitchen.<br />It's important to realize, by the way, that once you get the basics down, home-made pizza is a snap. The sauce and dough freeze beautifully, so you can easily make enough at one time to provide for maybe half a dozen home pizza nights--until your neighbors find out how good yours is.--Bill Marsano	2001-05-04

Most American pizza is awful--topped with tasteless &quot;pepperoni,&quot; dotted with the synthetic glop the USDA calls &quot;cheese-type food product.&quot;<br />So get Charles and Michele Scicolone's book and get to work. I only wish they'd written it sooner: I spent several years trying to figure out how to make a decent pizza without their help. Let me tell you it was a long, involved, expensive and frequently messy process. The results, in the end were excellent--except for the dough, which I could never get quite right. The Scicolones have solved that problem by doing real research in the field--by which I mean IN ITALY. As a result they recommend mixing regular flour witha certain amount of cake flour. Cake flour (the stuff used by pastry chefs, not the self-rising stuff) is softer than regular bread flour and the blend of the two types produces a soft, stretchy, easily worked dough that gives superb results.<br />Another reason for making your own pizza, by the way,is that it's a lot of fun. Get this book and try it.--Bill Marsano	2001-05-04

This is popular history in the Barbara Tuchman (Guns of August) manner: thoroughly researched by an expert who also has a fine sense of narrative drama (even the occasional footnotes are enjoyable): It's fun to read. It's &lt;thrilling&gt; to read.  The Age of Fighting Sail is conventionally put at about 160 years; author Miller has confined himself to the last quarter or so, and with good reason. The shorter time span narrows his focus and lets him richly detail on a period that needs detailed coverage. After all, at this time Britain was frequently in conflict with the US, then Bonaparte, then all of the countries that deserted the British cause to join Boney--or later deserted Boney to join Britain. Only details can reduce the confusion.  Here's an example of the value of detail: Most Americans learn in basic history class that Washington and Cornwallis somehow found themselves at Yorktown together, where Cornwallis just threw in the towel and--bang!--just like that the American Revolution ended. Miller shows that Cornwallis, hunting for glory, exhausted him army in a series of useless victories, fought too far inland for the Royal Navy to support or supply him, and then had to run to Yorktown in hope of being evacuated by the British fleet. But the French fleet got there first (by pure luck) and the Royal Navy's failure to trounce it was a perfect example of hidebound, backward tactics that took no risks but gained no glory. The over-cautious British admiral had protected his career and reputation but, as another historian put it, &quot;He had merely lost Amnerica.&quot;  As the American Revolution ends and the French begins, Miller shows British seapower on the cusp of change, at last moving away from risk-averse tactics under the urging of a generation of more daring commanders: Pellew, Howe, Collingwood, Jervis and the immortal, incomparable Nelson. Many of their battles were as exciting in fact as they are in the movies.  There's excellent material on the faltering beginnings of the American navy too, which (for example) Thomas Jefferson was mightily in favor of until, as president, he decided he didn't want to pay for it.  The cast of characters is superb: the British fighters mentioned above and scheming Boney, of course, but also the usual crew of addlepates and blockheads in the Admiralty; Captain Bligh (not the sadist he's been painted as); hilariously inept French and Spanish admirals; even worse British generals (except for the miraculous Arthur Wellesley--later the Duke of Wellington); and the odd, cross-grained collection of self-interested citizen-patriots of the American Revolution.  Nathan is especially good at distinguishing between naval combat and seapower; with brisk, incisive strokes he shows how all those blockades and sinking ships affected alliances and strategy. O'Brian fans will especially appreciate this because it will enable them to re-read the entire Aubrey/Maturin series with greater grasp of the period and the issues.--Bill Marsano	2001-01-10

Instead it is a gracefully written (Merullo is a novelist) exploration of what golfers really battle on the course--not just the lies and bunkers and crosswinds but themselves and their demons: Ego, Anger, Fear, and others. Merullo writes of how to &lt;approach&gt; the game, and he doesn't need to draw on any Tigers or White Sharks to enlighten you. Indeed what is most appealing about this book is the he writes from the perspective of a pretty-good amateur playing a no-name course in western Massachusetts. And if you step back a bit for some perspective, you see that this is really a book about life. MBA's who have worn out their copies of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; will find it worth their while, but any passionate golfer will enjoy a round in Merullo's company.	2000-12-12

He's also a witty writer and a perceptive observer, which makes him a superb interpreter of present-day France to almost any reader, whether he thinks all things French are heaven-sent or all Frenchmen are bullying snobs who ought to go to hell.<br />Rosenblum's chief concern here is French cuisine and what's happening to it--as well as the refined tastes of the average Frenchman. The treasures of the French table--including the famous 246 kinds of cheese--are at risk today. The economic power of international agribusiness and bureaucratic meddling by the European Union combine to drive many small food producers out of business. At the same time, restaurants face competition from &quot;McDo&quot; (as the French call Mickey-Dee) and small open-air markets are steadily undermined by supermarkets of a size even Americans would blanch at. All this sounds so far like a recipe for unrelieved gloom, but that is far from the case. Rosenblum travels widely interviewing chefs and cheesemakers among others, and it's suprising how many of them manage to be hopeful of the future. That's partly because Rosenblum is usually eating his way through France, and to have him describe a meal is what it must have been like to hear Keats read his own poems.<br />Rosenblum is a knowledgeable man with a lot of French history at his fingertips--and when he doesn't, he's still a reporter: he looks it up. As a result the reader feels secure that there's something here besides mere personal opinion, and surprising facts emerge. Most of us, for example, take it for granted that France's devotion to cheese is bone deep; in fact, Rosenblum learns from one of France's true maitres that it's really a recent phenomenon.<br />The writing itself is excellent and rewarding; Rosenblum is lighthearted at the keyboard and he doesn'tshy away from a first-rate pun. For example, explaining that French peasants supported the Revolution partly because hunting was strictly a royal privilege, Rosenblum notes that &quot;the reign was called on account of game.&quot; More important is Rosenblum's sincere love of France and--despite the recent waves of hysterical, anti-immigrtant nationalism--the French people as well.<br />On top of everything else, &quot;A Goose in Toulouse&quot; is a terrific antidote to the cynical calculations of &quot;A Year in Provence.&quot;	2000-11-01
