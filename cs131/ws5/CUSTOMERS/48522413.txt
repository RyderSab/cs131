In its all-American, seedy, rambling way, it has affinities with Kerouac's later \\"On the Road.\\" The episodic narrative is unified through cinematic handling of Cannery Row's topography.  We share the familiarity and intimacy of its buildings and spaces \\"kitty-corner\\", opposite, in front of, and behind each other.     The inhabitants thus spatially and topographically linked are no less vivid: Doc, wise and poetic, his laboratory full of his beloved marine specimens; Lee Chong, the canny Chinese grocer; Dora the local madam; and Mack with his \\"gang of good-natured losers who inhabit the Palace Flophouse\\" (per the Penguin edition).     Structurally, the vignettes linked by an overarching setting recall Anderson's \\"Sherwood, Ohio\\". An extended narrative is triggered by Mack's decision to spring a surprise party for the well-loved Doc. To raise the beer money, the dossers agree to net 400 frogs for Doc up the coast.  Thus starts a Pacific picaresque odyssey in Lee Chong's uncooperative Model T Ford - a recipe for trouble.     Steinbeck lovingly paints this rundown society with realism and respect, occasionally introducing chapters with an epic claim: \\"Monterey is a city with a long and brilliant literary tradition.\\" \\"The Model T Ford of Lee Chong had a dignified history\\". Set against this the true-to-life element: \\"Lee Chong got the truck in payment of a grocery bill.\\"     The beautiful comparison of Mack and his cohorts to the classical Graces has often been cited. Here's another detail which sums up this book's lyricism. When a disused old boiler is moved into a vacant lot, flowers germinate around it: \\"the thick fleshy tree grew up and the great white bells hung down over the boiler door and at night the flowers smelled of love and excitement, an incredibly sweet and moving odor.\\"     Only Steinbeck could have wrungsuch humanity out of a discarded bit of hardware. Fabulous.	2005-08-30
US	48522413	R18VXTADRBOYBY	0618084754	722874830	Reflections in a Golden Eye	Books	4	19	19	N	N	The Poetry of Menace	This novella is a brave, bald exploration of homosexuality and infidelity in the military.  It presents itself as a rare event that disturbs the routine dullness of peacetime military life.      The small circle of characters is individually and collectively self-destructive.  There's Captain Penderton, who comes to nurse ambivalent homosexual yearnings for Private Williams, who fancies his wife.  Meanwhile, Mrs Leonora Pederton is sleeping with General Langdon, whose wife, Alison, eventually succumbs to a complete breakdown of sanity.  Got that?  Good.  It's compulsive stuff.     In this narrow social circle, author McCullers sets \\"normal\\" domestic events such as cooking delicious Southern dinners, and card evenings, against sexual episodes (both overt and latent).  These range from Private Williams crouching in Mrs Penderton's room all night long to observe her sleeping naked, through to the tormentedly homosexual Captain Pemberton wrecking the body and spirit of his wife's horse on a particularly brutal ride.    In some ways, the strangest character is the Langdons' Filipino houseboy, Anacleto.  Effete, devoted and fastidious to a \\"T\\", a would-be dancer and artist, he provides tragic Mrs Langdon with a kind of love.  And it is Anacleto's artistic vision of a peacock with grotesque reflections in its golden eye that explains the title.    Typically of McCullers's Southern Gothicism, the writing infuses poetry with a feeling of utter menace.  At times it's scarily bald, yet lyrical:  \\"In the sky there was a white brilliant moon and the night was cold and silvery.\\"    Some have found it too short, but I don't see that as a problem.  It's a quick, chillingly stylish read that plumbs hidden psychological depths and doesn't shrink from uncomfortable truths.	2005-04-26

This is a superb, densely textured biography.  Ackroyd revels in the complex psychology and sociology of his subject, e.g., his devotion to duty, his father fixation, etc.  He also places Thomas More firmly in the London of his time and in his historical moment - the Reformation - especially through More's own writings.<br /><br />It has been remarked that the chapters amount to a series of vignettes.  That's true, and the amount of knowledge retailed in each glimpse of More and his world is staggering.<br /><br />To give but a few examples:<br />Chap. 3 - St. Anthony's Pigs: we follow young More through the streets of Tudor London to his school and get insight into the Renaissance education system.<br /><br />Ch 4 - Cough Not, Nor Spit: Thomas' early career as a page to Archbishop (of Canterbury) Morton, Henry VII's notorious \\"enforcer\\".  This relationship illuminates More's later dealings with Cardinal Wolsey.<br /><br />Ch 8 - We Talk Of Letters: sketches of Grocyn, Linacre, Lily, Colet, More - the \\"London humanists\\", or More's intellectual circle.<br /><br />And so on.  The book continues in the same fascinating vein.  It is a hard slog to read, and I'm sorry that Peter Ackroyd did not give a glossary of A) Latin and Greek expressions, and B) even some of his more obscure English words.  I also regret that there's no map to illustrate Ackroyd's loving depiction of the London where More learned, lived, worked and suffered.<br /><br />More's story is well known and often told.  Ackroyd has given a fully-rounded portrayal of the man, his background, career, family and friends.<br /><br />What a pleasure to read.	2005-04-20

He encountered massive opposition from a powerful astromical establishment which regarded mechanical solutions with contempt.  <br /> <br />As a non-scientist, I found the book a great read.   The first chapter gives background from Ptolemy to Harrison, including the passing of a Longitude Act and the institution of a Longitude Prize, to be determined by a Board. The last two chapters extend beyond Harrison's demise (1776), covering the chronometer's mass production and technological developments.  <br /> <br />The intervening material covers disastrous pre-longitude sea voyages, early attempts to map the heavens and calculate lunar distances, and the technology of early clocks.  Kudos to Sobel for maintaining intelligibility and excitement.  <br /> <br />Despite his achievements, Harrison suffered heartbreaking tribulation at the hands of an envious nemesis, Nevil Maskelyne (himself no mean astronomer) and the obstructive Board of Longitude. They withheld his money, put him and his fragile timepieces to crushing practical trials, and impounded them so that they could copy his ideas.  <br /> <br />An epic cast of kings, astronomers, sailors, mathematicians, and a scope of many generations help to make this an inspiring, informative and pragmatic work.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-16

So much Old English literature is presented to us in translation that we are at risk of losing the knowledge of the language.<br /><br />Not with this, however - the best anthology of Old English literature currently available. I've enjoyed digging around among the 56 prose and verse texts, which mingle old favourites with less familiar works. A reference grammar and comprehensive glossary are included at the end of the book.<br /><br />The texts are grouped thematically, in sections including: Teaching and Leaning (including bits from old medical lore), Recording (which includes some of the law codes of, e.g. King Ethelbert of Kent - the first notable Christian convert).<br /><br />Of course all the usually anthologised bits by King Alfred, Aelfric, etc. are there, plus the poems the Wanderer, Seafarer, and Dream of the Rood. But how nice to see some of the rarer stuff, which really give an insight into both Anglo-Saxon life and writing.<br /><br />It's beautifully laid out and easy to use, incorporating a reference grammar and glossary at the back. The likelihood of ruining this book with your own annotations is nil: Modern English word glosses and explanatory notes are considerately placed on the page you're reading.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2004-11-20
US	48522413	R2XHH4G7K02M8J	019283522X	543590144	A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy by Mr. Yorick: with The Journal to Eliza and A Political Romance (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Journey of discovery	Even for modern readers, \\"A Sentimental Journey\\" (published 1768)is as startlingly innovative as Sterne's celebrated \\"Tristram Shandy\\".   Sterne's ability to crystallize the minute details of experience - which may be down to a few seconds only - is reminiscent of  Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\".   Indeed, Woolf admired this book.    This is by no means an easy read.  The 18th-century prose is difficult; the book is larded with Frenchisms and Biblical or classical allusions; the complex, slow narrative often requires re-reading.  But the rewards are great!  It's wise, deeply comical, and incredibly perceptive.    There are several helpful reviews below dealing with the aspect of \\"sentimentality\\", and so I will just single out two things which appealed to me:    1.  STERNE AND BODY LANGUAGE.  Sterne shows an almost 20th-century appreciation of body language.  In fact, I believe he might have been the first to identify it as such.  His chapter, \\"The Translation\\", highlights the importance of being able to interpret subtle physical hints, like a language:  \\"There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this _shorthand_, and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words.\\"   How visionary!    2.  STERNE AND THE FRENCH.  Ever since Shakespeare inserted a scene in \\"cod French\\" into _Henry V_, actually ever since the Norman Conquest and up to Monty Python and beyond, the English have revelled in mocking the French and their language.  His Continental travelling gives Sterne the perfect excuse to do this.  At one point he differentiates between \\"tant pis\\" (= \\"never mind\\" - where there is nothing to be gained) and \\"tant mieux\\" (= so much the better - where there IS an advantage).  He also has a hilarious section on the grades of French swearing:  first \\"Diable!\\", then \\"Peste!\\" and finally the words that he won't repeat.  In all cases, Sterne carefully shows the social niceties of these expressions.    The protagonist, Yorick, has various adventures of lust and feeling with women and other typically travelish things like losing his passport that we can all relate to.  He's tender, obscene, learned, funny, companionable, and above all, readable - if tough.	2004-11-04

If you like your history easy to digest, you'll appreciate the accessible storytelling style and the short, manageable chapters.   Robert Lacey provides three maps and an index.  Dates are supplied alongside the chapter titles in the Contents. <br /> <br />The cavalcade of \\"A\\"-listers features Julius Caesar, Christ, Boadicea, Arthur, St Augustine, Bede, Alfred, Thomas a Becket.      Less familiar personalities include, e.g., King Oswy, the Lady of the Mercians, Hereward the Wake.   Other chapters deal with moments of historical importance, such as \\"Simon de Montfort and his Talking Place\\" which details the origins of Parliament (from the French parler = to talk). <br /> <br />The value of the book is that every chapter enshrines - somtimes quite cunningly -  a point of general knowledge.  So you're getting two books for the price of one.  For example, the chapter on Caedmon, the First English Poet, not only tells the legend of his creativity, but points out his innovation - singing Bible stories in the vernacular ENGLISH, as opposed to the more educated Latin.  The bit on the Domesday Book tells not only of that survey, but describes how English imported many French words from the conquering Normans.  The Julius Caesar story describes the invading Roman army while telling us about the Julian calendar. <br /> <br />A wonderfully interesting book, especially for the beginner.	2004-09-09

Maybe it's the rarefied life that fame brings, maybe it's Sounes's writing, hey - maybe it's me, but I found this book curiously lacking in \\"Zeitgeist\\" , or \\"spirit of the time.\\"      It is the early years that stand out most strongly:  Robert Zimmerman's childhood and youth in Duluth, Minn. (the Black Country).  Both his musical awakening and his early high school friendships and loves are soaked in 1950s and 1960s atmosphere.  Actually, the book is OK through the Apotheosis bit, when Bob reaches the height of his fame.      Thereafter, as it hauls itself from the 60s through to the 90s, it just seems to become a catalogue of concerts and names, which all resonate - I mean, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Madison Square Garden, what more could you want?  Personally, I wanted a little more analytical thread between this.  Sure it is interesting and readworthy but I felt these could have been connected up better.    Sounes does do well however, with Bob's records and recording sessions.  There are abundant fantastic details about the style of songs, Dylan's preoccupations for the lyrics, the session musicians and recording conditions.  His account made me want to listen to all the stuff that I don't know.	2004-08-13

Erudite, enthusiastic, plangent and moving,  &quot;In Search of England&quot; is a life-changing history for anyone who reads it.   Wood obviously loves Roman Britain, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval as well, although the book also draws connections reaching into early modern, nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  So the whole continuum is there.<br />The book falls into three sections:<BR>1.  Myth and History.   Wood excavates the popularity of icons such as King Arthur, sifting the evidence to pin them down in real time.  The sociology is interesting, particularly in the case of Robin Hood (&quot;Merrie Englande&quot;).<br />2.  Manuscripts and Mysteries.    Wearing his learning lightly, Wood shows the fascination of books, tracing one little book on its journey all the way back to Northern Italy.  Wood revels in the tales of John Leland, antiquarian to Henry VIII; of Bishop Asser, who wrote the biography of Alfred the Great; and of a possible biography of King Athelstan, Alfred's grandson.   <br />3.  Landscapes and People.  I first regarded this section with some dread.  How was it going to hold my interest, with such local emphasis?  But each chapter, with each place subtly differentiated,  sheds a fascinating light on England.  And in each, Wood does take a journey, justifying the subtitle of his book:  &quot;JOURNEYS Into the English Past&quot;.  <br />He explores a craftsman (&quot;The Last Bowl-Turner of England&quot;); a wood where Athelstan defeated the Vikings in 937AD (&quot;Tinsley Wood&quot;); &quot;A Devon House&quot; is all about continuity of occupancy; &quot;Peatling Magna&quot; shows a village community becoming politicized  in 1265; &quot;Jarrow and English History&quot; deals with the beginnings of English historical writings under the Venerable Bede.  <br />Best is last.  The &quot;Epilogue:  &quot;An English Family&quot;, shows both multiculturalism and patriotism off to their best effect, bringing things bang up to date with an incredible twist on your expectations as a reader.<br />Yes, it helps if you know English history.  If you don't, read this book with a date chart or search some of the people and places mentioned above on the Web first.   <br />And when you read this book, prepare to feel uplifted and humbled, and privileged to be on this planet, Earth.  Wood will immediately take his place on your list of ideal drinking companions.	2004-06-25

The whole setting exemplifies Southern Gothic from the word go:  &quot;The town itself is dreary; not much is there except the cotton-mill, the two-room houses where the workers live, a few peach trees, a church with two coloured windows, and a miserable main street only a hundred yards long.&quot;<br />I was hooked by the beginning, evoking dilapidation, isolation, heat, distress and latent fear/weirdness.  Much has been written on McCullough's &quot;lover and beloved&quot; theme, well explored here.  The characters are an unforgettable collection of weirdos, still, somehow, typically American; the descriptions are poetic.  In general the writing rings true, is economic yet lyrical - nothing is wasted.<br />Great as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, in its way. Much better than &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot;. It lives up to its title, truly a &quot;ballad&quot; - a songlike story.  And the ballad of the mixed-race chain gang that ends it ties the story to the South.<br />I was sorry to finish it!  Utterly compelling.	2004-03-06

As World War II broke and rumbled on, she longed for London.  Writing this book was an expiation of her nostalgia.    <br />The novel's title is the triumphant declaration of the book's narrator, dispossessed wannabe writer Cassandra.  In fact,  it is author Smith who \\"captures\\" the angst of her young heroines, class warfare, tension between Transatlantic neighbours and especially of the England of the 1930s that she missed.<br />Apart from the luminous romance, two of the characters are concerned with writing.  Young narrator/protagonist Cassandra ambitiously works through her story in ever-more-expensive notebooks.  By contrast, her unproductive father cannot reproduce his early creative form.<br />It's a good story in the Jane Austen comedy-of-manners tradition, with a little sexiness of DH Lawrence mixed in, and the down-at-heel feeling of, e.g., Cold Comfort Farm\\".  The compulsive beginning immediately establishes Cassandra, the writing motive, and engages our sympathy:   \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.  That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.\\"	2004-02-23

Lawrence Johnson's review below (dated February 8) says it all.<br />If this book aspires to anything, it is sexual coming-of-age for the heroine.  Anticipation and tension lend an erotic air, but the story never really lifts off.  The bits about art and Vermeer's life may be gleaned from artbooks or biographies.<br />It's like superior Mills & Boon romance, with its stereotypes: the downtrodden heroine, the sexy, enigmatic master,  quasi-evil patrons, jealous wives/mothers/daughters.  Unfortunately the narrative is limited to the single perspective of the self-satisfied Griet.  But other viewpoints, such as that of her suitor, the sexy but smelly young butcher Pieter, or her antagonist, the vindictive Cornelia, would have given more light and shade.	2004-02-17

This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic.  In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair.  The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.<br />The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality.  In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation.  A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive.  Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts.  There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part.  There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.<br />This novel gives an insight into civic life,  the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns.  But the animal instincts of the wife-sale,  the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.<br />Great stuff.	2004-02-15

Allow  2 months to read it, and if you cannot clear at least 35 pages a day, don't pick it up that day. Run some contrasting short books alongside it (I read some Carson McCullers, for example) so that you won't feel bored/depressed/guilty while scrabbling along.   <br />Is it worth reading?   Definitely.  It has its faults, but is an immensely worthy book.  Is that enough?  Sure.  You will get some good stories and a lot of history.  <br />Rutherfurd subtitled it \\"The Novel of England\\", asserting that  \\"Sarum is a novel and to see it as anything else would be a mistake.\\"    22,000 years of love, lust, envy, hatred, success, failure are chronicled in pot-boilerish narrative.   It's mostly skilful, sometimes frankly two-dimensional.   A couple of chapters run to as much as 150-200 pages, luckily with internal breaks.  They have been compared to discrete novellas, but the fictional families unify the novel.  <br />Rutherfurd sets his imaginary families \\"amongst people and events that either did exist, or might have done.\\"  People have questioned his selection of dates, but each enshrines a landmark of English history. Concerned with his characters' physical survival above all,  there is admittedly too much on drainage and masonry.   <br />But this is a minor quibble.   Rutherfurd provides a terrific canvas of political, social, religious, cultural, and industrial events.  Along the way, he brings in important figures like Charlemagne and  major literary works, e.g.,  Beowulf.   You might question some of the relevance, but it's mostly  rewarding - and I assure you, there's plenty to be learned from this book.<br />Finishing it was a struggle, but I'm glad I did.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-12

Set in 1948, the book epitomises post-war America, but it echoed down into the 60s.  <br />Elements of quest and picaresque abound in this search for dream-fulfilment and self-realisation, almost Quixotic in its delusional frenzy.   Place-names are intoned hypnotically for the necessarily strong topographical slant:  \\"...we rolled across the hoodwink night of the Louisiana plains - Lawtell, Eunice, Kinder, and De Quincy, western rickety towns becoming more bayou-like as we reached the Sabine.  In Old Opelousas I went into a grocery store to buy bread and cheese while Dean saw to gas and oil.\\"      <br />The imagery is strong on colour, especially red of all kinds:  for night, for heat, for desert, etc.  There are also photographic snapshots, people glimpsed once and never again:  \\" - a little girl in the back seat, crying to her mother, \\"Mama when do we get home to Truckee?'\\"  <br />Included in the vast cast of supporting characters are Dean's wife and one true love Marylou, his lovers Camille and later, Inez, plus  legendary, larger-than-life  folk like Old Bull Lee, Carlo Marx (ha, ha) and Remi Boncoeur.  Kerouac exhibits knowledge of humankind at work and at play - including some marvellous sections on club life and jazz (George Shearing being compared to God).<br />I found the last hundred pages hard going.   Dean's inevitable downward trajectory is tragic, though.  Essential reading for the background to James Dean, to \\"Easy Rider\\", \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" and other \\"buddyship\\" classics.  Not to mention the intellectual underpinning of post-world War II,  and the precursors of rock'n'roll.	2003-11-29

Editor Elaine Treharne includes generous extracts of almost every major work of Old and Middle English.  <br />Her parallel translations are an outstanding feature.   As you read, you can improve your understanding of both Old and Middle English. Good whether you're new to this, or returning &quot;rusty&quot; after a lapse. <br />So many milestones are offered, as to provide a supreme monument to early English Lit.  Treharne fulfils her aim, &quot;to provide an extensive selection of literary texts that effectively covers the earliest writings in the vernacular up to the time of Chaucer.&quot;  <br />The organisation is unorthodox.  Since many medieval texts were passed on orally, and are &quot;not securely dated&quot;, Treharne organises them by &quot;extant manuscript date&quot;.  She departs from usual critical/editorial practice by NOT imposing a date of composition.  This method enables the reader to learn about such documents as the four main Old English codices, and, e.g., the Harley MS for medieval English Lyrics.<br />There's plenty here to inspire or to help with college papers ....   The impressive, readable introduction contextualizes the works by surveying national, religious, social and literary history.    Other sections deal with manuscript culture, forms of poetry, and language, including a grammatical overview.  <br />A great book for, say, a college readings course, but there's a lifetime's reading here!	2003-11-24

Ashley's organising principle, unity versus disunity within Britain, results in some confusing arrangement of material.   For example, in the first Section, Kingdom Against Kingdom:  Early Britain:  after \\"The House of Normandy 1066-1154\\" he backtracks several hundred years to the Kingdoms of Wales (500-1240) and Scotland (850-1165).  Then the narrative resumes in 1154 with The House of Anjou.  <br />This mine of information, though daunting at first glance, covers monarchs' appearance, character, consorts, political,  social, religious and cultural history.  Among 100 pages of appendices are lists of Roman emperors and governors, kings of British provinces, royal consorts, family trees.  The massive bibliography, handy for historic royal watchers, precedes the index. <br />You would probably want something more snappy and anecdotal on your shelf as well as this.

Pre-Saxon Rule; 2. Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; 3. Saxons, Normans and Plantagenets; 4. Tudors and Stuarts; 5. Hanover to Windsor. The Compendium (part 6) includes Crown Jewels, Nicknames, and Genealogical Charts.  <br />It is particularly good on ancient British chiefs and Celtic tribes, rarely covered in other guides.  A short two-page overview of each monarch is preceded by a summary box containing birth and death dates and places, parentage, accession to the throne, coronation, authority (i.e. status and titles), death date and burial details.   <br />The major public and personal events of each reign are outlined.  Also, there are features on such events as the Roman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms, Wars of the Roses, the Gunpowder Plot, Home Rule and the British Empire. Contemporary illustrations, e.g. the Bayeux Tapestry for the Norman Conquest, lend period flavour.<br />A perfect introduction, overview, or review.  It's a useful first source before proceeding to longer royal histories or individual biographies.  <br />Essential.	2003-11-18

Notwithstanding the occasional burst of sexism, Hardy still exhibits enough knowledge of human nature to make his characters alive and sympathetic to us.  This holds true for both their cataclysmic moments of life-change, and also their small, relatively unimportant, actions.<br />But I can't pretend that it's easy to read.  The narrative is intermittently broken by long bouts of West Country dialect.  When reading these episodes, one tends to glaze over, so impenetrable are the vocabulary and accents.  And the triviality!  But don't just charge on.  By all means skim over these knotty bits, but flip back and nail them down before moving on. The Dorset rustics function like a Greek chorus. Their opinions, rumours, actions, are important background texture and sometimes catalysts.  They may perhaps be seen as the \\"Madding Crowd\\" of the title.<br />And now to the \\"Far\\" bit.  I will resist plot summary, and observe that the three protagonists' allegorical names echo Hardy's cultural preoccupations, which come out in plentiful allusions:  Bathsheba =  Biblical.  Troy =  Greek mythology.  Oak =  Englishness (first name Gabriel is again Biblical).  The book is stuffed with these three types of allusions, intermixed, in Hardy's painterly style, with elemental, lyrical, elegiac descriptions and narrative.<br />There's a particularly good introduction by Rosemarie Morgan in the Penguin Classic edition.  It relates Hardy's mixing of high and low elements to Victorian tastes.<br />This beautiful book fully merits its classical status.  I avoided novels for years, but am glad to have read this one.	2003-11-11

Nice bite-sized nuggets, each monarch being handled individually.  Coronations of noteworthy consorts are include e.g., Anne Boleyn.<br />It helps if you have a passing acquaintance with some of the history.  But it's not essential.  Hilliam places each individual coronation and monarch in context, in easily readable narrative. There's plenty of trivia, both familiar and non.   <br />The content ranges from sumptuous to humorous - such as a splendidly-attired Piers Gaveston outraging envious fellow courtiers by carrying the St Edward crown at the coronation of his King and lover, Edward II; or Queen Victoria's Archbishop of Canterbury accidentally omitting a couple of pages and being forced by her to return to the beginning of the section.  There are various one-page topical essays, e.g., one on the original King's Stone at Kingston, whereon crownings reputedly first occurred, and another on the Stone of Scone - now returned from Westminster Abbey to its native Scotland.   <br />The appendices include a simplified, but useful, genealogy, plus the Form of the Coronation, and also a rundown of the regalia (i.e. crowns, sceptres, spurs - the lot, which may be seen in the Tower of London).<br />This is genial, informative, entertaining - and fun.	2003-11-05

Among his classics are \\"The Darkling Thrush\\", \\"Channel Firing\\" (great World War I poem), and \\"The Oxen\\" (beautiful Christmas poem about nostalgia and faith).<br />Like his novels, the poems illustrate Hardy's capturing of the past and his sense of something greater than us shaping our lives and our feelings.  These are apparent in \\"Last Words to a Dumb Friend\\", his lament for his deceased cat.  In this, the very home where the cat lived seems to resonate with the cat once he has passed to \\"the Dim\\" (i.e., beyond Death):<br />\\"And this house, which scarcely took<BR>Impress from his little look, <BR>By his faring to the Dim          (NOTE: faring = travelling)<BR>Grows all eloquent of him.\\"	2003-09-26

Following in the footsteps of many classical novels (including \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and \\"North and South\\", to name but two) it's essentially an Oxford book.  Pullman's Oxford, with its mediaeval customs, is interestingly cross-fertilized with futuristic aspects.  But there are other settings, with influences including semi-Amish for the gypsies, and of course, the far North.  Genre-wise, academia meets sci-fi, with elements of odyssey (= journey).      The characterisation offers a neat twist on \\"buddyship\\": an anti-heroine in the person of tomboyish, malevolent Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, who changes shapes at will.  Daemons are similar to the human's soul, and all the human characters have them.    In \\"Northern Lights\\", the villainy of Gobblers is interlinked with the phenomenon of Dust, with children, adults, and daemons.  Non-human characters include witches and armed bears.  The narrative teems with suspense, terror, love and tenderness, wringing a gamut of reactions from the reader.      I enjoyed reading this.  Pullman is inventive without being strained, clever without being arrogant or judgmental.  The descriptions are spellbinding.       A real page-turner for all ages, it has been dramatised by the Royal National Theatre in Great Britain (excellent two-parter) and as the film, _The golden Compass_.	2003-09-26

Surely not...) in the South of England.  The Hales relocate in Milton, in Darkshire, loosely modelled on Manchester.  In the North, they learn the realities of industrial life, the poverty, social injustice, rampant death, etc.<br />Politically and socially, the local mill-owner, John Thornton, is Margaret's antagonist.  Their initial mutual revulsion evolves eventually, through mutual sympathy, into love.  Add in Margaret's brother, Frederick, living abroad under a cloud for mutiny, and you have the ingredients of a good story.<br />But the first 200 pages are, as another reviewer has remarked, tedious beyond belief.  However, the last 250 or so pages fly by.  Gaskell plots the story well.  The many deaths, both lingering and sudden, are harrowing and moving.  Ideologically, Gaskell was an armchair socialist, a middle-class wife who could afford to ally herself with the workers.  Her style, packed with Victorianisms, is in some ways contemporary and highly idiomatic, and she handles conversation particularly well.  There's much Northern dialogue to struggle through.<br />You'll struggle to reach the middle of the book, and then you won't be able to put it down.  My fave chapter is the one where Margaret, after many reversals, returns to her native town of Helstone.  Her nostalgia is tempered by the realisation that life moves on.  Even this little jewel of a village is sadly changed.   But, as she well knows, c'est la vie!	2003-09-02

Hardy views his cast of rustics through the prism of music: the old church stringed instruments choir is to be replaced with the spanking new organ. There is the added romantic interest of young musician Dave and the controversially female organist, Fancy Day. <br />This is a story of established customs breaking down through the interloper: a new vicar in town. Structurally divided into Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn, it follows the natural rhythms of the earth and of society. Hardy revels in his descriptive powers. <br />Filled with nostalgia and that increasingly fashionable concept, \\"Englishness\\", and seasoned with wisdom and wit, this is truly fabulous.  It's a mini-masterpice in a similar bag to, say, Mrs. Gaskell's \\"Cranford\\".	2003-06-08

Christopher Hibbert's comprehensive, readable biography is a good starting-point.  However, as detractors have pointed out, it is short on political analysis.  The emphasis is on \\"royal\\".<br />Hibbert sets the stage for Victoria's accession with a marvellous summary of how her various royal forebears failed to provide an heir, so that she succeeded by default.  He delineates Queen Victoria's complex relationships with several Prime Ministers: her neediness with Lord Melbourne and Disraeli, antipathy towards Palmerston and Gladstone, respect for Salisbury. Unfortunately he does not clearly enough differentiate between Whigs and Tories. But he does acquaint the reader with the major political personalities and put you in a position to explore further. A useful reference alongside this book is \\"The Prime Ministers from Walpole to Macmillan\\" (possibly only available in the UK, and in danger of going out of print).<br />Skilfully interweaving Victoria's personal history with national and international landmark events, Hibbert provides handy, if underwritten, overviews of the Indian Mutiny, the Crimean War, the Great Exhibition, and Chartism. He also sketches contemporary European royals like Napoleon III, exploring tensions between France, Italy and Austria.<br />Co-dependency, egotism and self-pity characterised Victoria's personal contacts. Her henpecking of her intelligent, unpopular consort Albert, and later selfish blocking of her children's marriages in order to keep them around, echo her own repressive childhood. But Victoria's households at Balmoral and Osborne were beacons of domesticity, and she was well-travelled and sophisticated.<br />She hated pregnancy, resented her children, and was scathingly dismissive of the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII). After Prince Albert's untimely death, she avoided official engagements for years, to the consternation of her government and people.  She fostered obsessional bonds with her Scottish and Indian servants.<br />Her prolific writings reveal a needy, infantile and self-obsessed woman. Her USE of CAPITALS in an age before the telephone, is a way of SHOUTING (not unlike the internet), and italics give her prose stridency.<br />So what were Queen Victoria's merits, if any? By dint of longevity she was the epoxy glue of the Age which took her name, and her progeny peopled the Royal houses of Europe. Surviving several assasination attempts, Victoria held her family and household in thrall, and the country in awe. Somehow she inspired the loyalty, if also exasperation, of her Governments.<br />Henry VIII or Elizabeth I she ain't, but the story is worth reading.

Because Aucoin is not tied to any specific company, this book does not limit the reader by recommending products that are currently in fashion or on department store stands.     For his myriad styles, Aucoin will merely identify \\"light flesh-coloured lip pencil\\", or \\"liquid black eyeliner\\". No brand names - yippee! Thus it tremendously increases your awareness of products and the standbys and treats that you'll need in your artillery to achieve the looks you want, whether on yourself or on others.    Aucoin begins by analysing each facial feature. He explains the techniques of applying foundation, blush, eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipliner, lipstick - even eyebrow pencil (telling you to make a \\"box\\" at the inside corner - hello, Ava Gardner!). Very clever, very helpful.    In his analysis of brushes, Aucoin does not plus any particular company. But he does explain what different brushes do, and you can therefore conclude for yourself which of them you'll need.  (Best to go to a theatre make-up shop, where you'll usually get objective advice.)    The illustrations and \\"types\\" of look are wonderful and really extend one's range and comprehension.

Weir begins by describing Henry's massive inheritance of \\"greater\\" and \\"lesser\\" houses.  Then she proceeds to his palatial lifestyle, part of the attribute of \\"magnificence\\" pertaining to a Renaissance prince, fuelled by Henry's lifelong mania for acquiring and developing property.   No detail, whether of texture or cost, is omitted.  (Weir helpfully multiplies contemporary values by 300 to give us today's equivalent). <br />The layout of King Henry's dwellings spoke volumes about courtiers' status and the monarch's accessibility.   Courtiers hovered in the impersonal Great Watching Chamber, unless they were lucky enough to have a formal meeting in the Presence Chamber.  Only a select few attended the King in his Privy Chamber.   Weir's mind-numbing account of Tudor Human Resources yields a smorgasbord of functions, various staff changes, promotions, demotions and, of course, executions. <br />Later in the book, a biographical framework imposes itself.   Henry's infamous matrimonial career is freshly presented from his viewpoint, although that does not lessen his monstrousness. He loved tilting and tournaments; that leg injury was a sporting injury. Most of his best friends seem to have been chosen for their skill in breaking lances.<br />As in her other books, Weir provides astute mini-biographical \\"snapshots\\" of personalities familiar and obscure:   the King's coterie of playmates and companions, mistresses and their families, advisors, chancellors and churchmen.    So you are getting many biographies for the price of one, especially of people like Thomas More, or Henry's two sisters Margaret (who mothered the Stuart dynasty) and Mary (whose second marriage to Charles Brandon produced the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, her granddaughter, subsequently the \\"Nine Days' Queen\\"). <br />One interesting character is Henry Fitzroy, Henry VIII's illegitimate son by Bessie Blount. Fitzroy's existence proved that the King could father a male child, howbeit not a legitimate heir.  (Henry Fitzoy was eventually created Earl of Richmond. The poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was a childhood friend of Fitzroy.)<br />So if you want to know more about the Courtenays, the Boleyns, Norfolks and Suffolks, the Seymours, the Parrs, this is your book. In spades! Weir does it well.	2003-02-04

We follow the triumphs and tragedies of the Duckets, Barnikels, Flemings, Doggets, Merediths, and Silversleeves through sixteen centuries.     Taking as his starting point the moment when the Thames estuary was carved out of a prehistoric land mass, Rutherfurd interweaves landmark historical events with his characters' lives. The colourful tapestry is enriched by the inclusion of real characters, including Henry II, Chaucer, Grinling Gibbons, Sir Christopher Wren, Tompion the watchmaker, etc.     The amount of information - historical, sociological, cultural, technological, architectural, financial - is staggering. Yet it never detracts from the story. There are marriages, affairs, deceptions, murders, tragedies, all working within the developing topography and life of London. From the first Thamesside settlements to the thriving metropolis of today, each universe is brilliantly evoked. Each moment, whether Roman, Tudor, Victorian, is filled with integrity and develops into a compelling and coherent narrative.
