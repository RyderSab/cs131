It was a fun & fast read with lots of excitement and \\"who done it\\" questions that will keep you very entertained!  Every time you think you have figuered it out, Jennifer Colt throws you for a loop.<br /><br />The story revolves around two crazy twins, Kerry & Terry who own their own private detective agency.

Melanie Banksis a VP Financial Planner @ Pierce, Shelley and Steinbergin in New York City.  Her Ex, Dan Swain is a \\"has been\\" football player for the NY Giants.  After getting divorced, Melanie has to pay him alimony to keep him accustomed to the lifestyle he had when they were married.  He has no job and spends his days (and her money) by going to the gym, drinking expensive champagne, wearing designer clothes and \\"hanging out\\".<br /><br />Melanie hires the well-known matchmaker, Desiree to help her find a love interest for Dan.  You see, in the fine print of their divorce papers, it states that if Dan gets married or lives with another woman for 3 months, she no longer has to pay him alimony.  Thus, her search for the perfect Love Connection begins.<br /><br />I have been a huge Jane Heller fan & have read all of her books.  An Ex to Grind and Lucky Stars have been VERY different from her earlier novels that were always filled with fun & crazy plots that guaranteed laughs.  These last two, anyone could have written them - they did not have that unique quality that I had come to love.	2005-07-30

Her adoptive parents divorced when she was 2 years old and her Mother began drinking ~ heavily.  She has always gone out of her way to be nice to the kids in school for acceptance, but they only used her.  I had a laugh out loud moment when reading whenever her Mother see's her eating, she has a \\"face like she found Allison with her pants down taking a dump in her crock pot\\".  Every Friday of every month, she has to pick up her Mother to run her errands because she got her drivers license suspended after getting a DUI/running over a dog.<br /><br />Anywho, Allison goes to bed one night and wakes up the next morning totally transformed into a thin, beautiful goddess.

The \\"new\\" Allison gets lots of attention and is approached by a scout for a modeling career.  Allison #2 can find out what her family/room-mate/co-workers/friends honestly think about her since her appearance has been altered.<br /><br />Waking Beauty makes you stop and think that we do (as a society) treat people differently because of appearance.  I'm not saying that I agree with that, that's just the way that it is. I try to treat every person that I come into contact with the way that I would like to be treated regardless of race, appearance, etc.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more from Elyse Friedman.iedman.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-05

From the elegance of her kitchen to the simplistic clothes that she wears which do not distract the viewer from whatever she is cooking.<br /><br />I will admit that I do not buy many cookbooks. I find it is easier to check them out from the library, browse and then make a photocopy the recipes that I like.  I think Giada's book was released on a Tuesday - two days later, I purchased it.<br /><br />I have always loved cooking Italian food. I find myself wanting to experiment and try each & every recipe in Everyday Italian.  I've started investing in more expensive cookware that I know will stand the test of time - I even bought a huge Sea Salt grinder today!  **laughing**<br /><br />Getting to the point, Giada has made me realize that cooking doesn't have to be hard.

Luckily, for Mitchell there is a blizzard which prevents him from returning back on the first flight to CA.  Ally is stuck with nerd who hates cold weather and wear funny, mix matched clothes.<br /><br />I adore VLT's characters because they are so out there and will make you laugh.  Example:<br /><br />Becky Baylor - the owner of the Loose Moose.  She is a \\"chunky chick\\", married seven , wears black stretch pants and who's bedroom would make Heidi Fleiss blush.<br /><br />Rudy - a local in Porcupine complete with a long red beard that ZZ TOP would kill for, many missing teeth who raises chickens in his kitchen.

In their six years together, Joe has molded Alice into the the person that he wanted her to be to make their marriage work.<br /><br />Alice & Joe are forced to leave London & move to NYC.

As much as we like to think that we are the \\"one\\" that our beloved will alter their lifestyle, it's simply not realistic.  As far as Joe is concerned, what comes around....goes around.  Sometimes the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  How cliche is that?  ;-)<br /><br />I have not been much of a fan of Jane Green's after Jemima J (which I thought was fabulous) but I found myself growing fond of all the characters in To Have and To Hold.

From the top of his 'oozie red boil infested face' to the bottom of his wet muddy shoes (think stalker again).<br />I would like to believe that Brian grows up (and out of his acne) to be a wonderful, intelligent person with a promise of a great life.	2004-07-05

The Second Assistant starts off with a promise that you will be able to sneak a peek into the lives of Hollywood's rich and powerful. Enter Elizabeth aka Lizzie who is hired to be a Second Assistant to Scott Wager at The Agency, an agent to the STARS.<br />I admit that the rich &amp; famous intrigue me. It amazes me how that nothing is impossible to obtain when you have people at your beck and call.  So, if you are looking forward to reading about the outrageous demands that Assistants are forced to deal with, this is not your book.<br />Second Assistant attempts to put Lizzie in funny/embarassing situations that will make you laugh out loud...but it does not.<br />The best way to describe Second Assistant is like riding a roller coaster. You make your way up the hill and having a good time.  All of a sudden, you fall fast and are stuck at the bottom for a while.  Slowly, you ride back up again with a smile on your face not knowing that you will be coming to an abrupt, complete stop at the very end.<br />The ending gives hints that there may be a sequel, but I will not be reading it.	2004-06-27

A controlling mother, no real friends and alone in the city that never sleeps.  Sheila's answer to her misery is to commit suicide.  The entire book is her suicide note to all the people in her life that have caused her pain.<br />Sheils gets all her affairs in order including her will, the Rabbi to read her eulogy, her cemetary plots, etc and wants to make sure that everyone knows that she died because she was not a married woman.<br />This is a serious issue but has some LOL moments that will keep you reading until you finish the last page.	2004-05-10

Tara &amp; Amy have been the best of friends since they were young, despite their insecurities and jealousy of one another. Tara is always beautiful and put togeether while Amy is liked by all. Their friendship seems fine until Amy catches Tara (her maid of honor)doing the horizontal no-no with her fiancee, Stuart.<br />Skip ahead four years.  Tara is a popular publicist at a publishing company and Tara remains her beautiful self, married to Stuart. It is awkward for both when they bump into each other on the streets of New York after not speaking for years.  Amy learns that she will be in charge of publicity for Tara's new book entitled Simply Beautiful - a Martha Stewart how to, if you will.  With years of therapy, Amy has tried to put her best friend and fiancee's betrayal behind her.  She's got to work with this woman for the sake of her job and reputation. Having to deal with Tara's Simply Beautiful marriage  will push her to the limits, but not all is what it seems.<br /><br />I love*love*love Jane Heller!  I've been such a fan of her wacky &amp; laugh out loud plots for years.  I've even email'd her to share my praise.  I will be honest &amp; say that I almost gave up on Best Enemies. The first half is written as &quot;Amy's version&quot; of the past/present.  As with everything, there's always two sides to each story.  The second half details &quot;Tara's version&quot; which is more exciting. I wish that it would have come sooner in the book, but better late than never.<br />If you are a fan of Heller's, you will like Best Enemies although you will discover a more realistic plot versus some of her ingenious storylines that you may have enjoyed in the past.	2004-04-21

Molly's character is someone that I would LOVE to have as a girlfriend.  She's charming, hillarious, and has a heart of gold when she lets someone get close enough.<br />I am keeping my fingers crossed that Michaels will write a sequel to This Can't be Love b/c I would love to know how Molly &amp; Dom's life emerges.	2004-03-23

Again, she has created a page turner until the end.<br />Suburban Renewal introduces you to Corrie and her husband Sam. After 25 years of marriage, we peek into their morning routine of coffee and reading the paper.  Without waring, Corrie brings up the &quot;D&quot; word ~ divorce.<br />Like no other novel that I have had the pleasure of reading, Moresi takes us back 25 years prior to when the couple first meets and falls in love.  We learn the struggles that Corrie &amp; Sam have to deal with over the years which begin with teenage pregnancy. Corrie's mother does not approve of Sam and is ashamed of her careless daughter.  Corrie and Sam choose to get married and have their daughter, Lauren. With little money, the couple moves into a garage apartment and try to make ends meet.  Corrie's mother is trying to swallow the choices that she has made until she learns that Corrie is pregnant with her second child.<br />Suburban Renewal is filled with Corrie &amp; Sam's struggles - from his father coming back into his life, raising teenagers, unemployment, AIDS and suicide.<br />One aspect of Moresi's writing that I love is that her stories are not happy from the beginning to the end.  Meaning, they are true to life and the struggles that we endure on a daily basis.  Sometimes we have a happy ending, sometimes not.  But, it we have people in our lives to lend us love and support, that will help us to get through anything.	2004-03-20

Keeps a Life Goals by the time she's 30 diary.  Exec Admin Assistant at ad agency.  Loves Fashion. Obsessed w/Robert Plant.<br />Adam - Ba$tard ionic bonder live in boyfriend/Boss.<br />David, Sylvester, Katy, Tish, Rachel - great group of friends.<br />Julia - Emma's mother who lives in London.<br />Father, Peri, the terrible twins - Emma's stepmother/brothers.<br />Jack - Peri's brother.<br />I am finding it hard to write this review because there are so many characters and individual stories to 32AA.  Each person has their own issues that they are dealing with. I found it confusing at times to keep up with who's who/who's dong what, but somehow it all comes together.  This is a VERY funny book, perfect for reading on a beautiful day by the pool (which I did).<br />With that said, I think I will classify 32AA as a mixture of Bridget Jones Diary (the movie) and Sex & the City - so, if you like either/or, I am confident you will enjoy this.	2004-03-15

I wasn't that impressed with Margolis's first novel.<br />I had attempted to read &quot;Neurotica&quot; about 5 times before finally sitting down and starting over again. Dan is a hypochondriac (who diagnosis himself in very unusual, hilarious ways) and it's driving his wife, Anna crazy.<br />This book will share Dan's quest to find out the root of his sickness, Anna's adulterous relationship(s) and the adventures that Anna's mother has to deal with from a stalker.<br />Neurotica has some very funny moments which include Anna trying to color her gray pubic hairs with &quot;Bush Magic&quot; before her first extra marital affair and Dan taking a poop in a pickle jar to take to a Gastro doctor.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't start becoming involved with the characters until halfway through the book but I am glad that I followed through until the end.<br />Margols has come a LONG way with her two latest books, Spin Cycle and Apocolipstic which are two of my fav's!	2003-03-14

Another great read from Sophie Kinsella!!!<br />Although Shopaholic Ties the Knot doesn't hold true to the previous two books as far as the character, Becky Bloomwood shopping debt - it is still funny (LOL) that you will enjoy.<br />Becky is torn b/w having the \\"wedding of the century\\" at the Plaza Hotel in NY or the small, intimate ceremony back home in England. As both parents of the couple plan the wedding in NY/England, Becky can never find just the right moment to tell the other that the plans are cancelled. Does she really want to have to decide b/w her mother's wedding dress or a Vera Wang?<br />As usual, Becky makes excuses and can never find the right time  to tell her Mother that she's decided to get get married in NY and vice versa, she can't seem to tell Luke's Mother (who is paying for the entire wedding) that she really wants to get married in England.<br />In a twist (that I figuered out) Becky and Luck get to have the best of both worlds.<br />If you have enjoyed the adventures of Becky Bloomwood - you will enjoy this!!!!!	2003-03-10

I enjoyed this book so much and couldn't wait to see what happens next.<br />Her characters have all the making of a bestseller ~ comedy, romance, suspense. If you've ever been in a relationship where the odds are stacked against you, but for some reason LOVE always wins? Then you need to read this book.<br />Very charming!	2003-02-26

While a guest in his home, she consumes way too many Tums which is due to the hot & spicy menu every morning, noon & night. Cassie learns that Roland has many ghosts in his closet which is preventing him from writing another great story, but she will try ANYTHING to help him with his writers block.<br />This is a fun story about forgiving the past, getting on with your life and finding closure.

I must say that I was very impressed with &quot;Cocktails for Three!&quot;.<br />You read about the tales of 3 best friends who meet at a Manhattan Bar the same night every month. They get to catch up on everything that is going on with their lives.<br />Maggie is pregnant. Roxanne has been dating a married man for 6 years. Candice has such a warm heart and can't seem to say &quot;NO.&quot;<br />The end of the book will throw you for a loop. As other reviews have said, you will not see it coming.<br />This book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next to the (3) characters. I am sure that you will be able to identify a personal friend of yours for Maggie, Roxanne and Candice. I was able to finish in just (1) day which is rare for me.<br />I can't wait to check out Wickman's other two books.<br />Enjoy!	2003-01-28

The whole email concept was unique and I thought it would be interesting.<br />***WRONG***<br />I know that this was suppossed to be a \\"fun\\" book, but I found it very difficult to connect to any of the characters. There were about 10 different plots going on at one time. You could be reading a current email between two people and then on the next page is an email answer from 10 pages ago...I found it very hard to follow and just plain boring.	2003-01-28

I am a new fan of Jane Heller's - working my way up to reading her collection of wonderful books. Her imagination paired with realism is a masterpiece!<br />This book hit so close to home for me! Elizabeth Baskin is married to Roger and is not happy with her marriage. She feels as if the \\"thrill\\" is gone. He doesn't pay as much attention to his looks, he works too much, gained weight, makes messes with English Muffin crumbs every morning (and doesn't clean them up) and falls asleep on the couch at night watching TV...sound familiar?????<br />Elizabeth finds out about a \\"Life Enhancement\\" doctor who seems to have the answer to Roger's problem through a potion made up of herbs from Central America. She meets the doctor and is given what he called \\"The Stud Stimulant\\" that she is to sneak into his morning OJ or coffee. When the first dose doesn't take affect fast enough, being impatient she gives him double doses.<br />Needless to say, Roger is back to the man she first fell in love with. His sex drive is nonstop, he buys new clothes, goes to the gym, watches what he eats.<br />Sounds like the perfect potion, right? But, what about if he wants sex so much - that YOU can't keep up with him? What if<br />he becomes so obsessed with working out and eating healthy that he begins to complain about how YOU look?<br />In the beginning of the book, you learn that Elizabeth is employed with a company that sends her to 5 star hotels. She gets to stay there free, make impossible demands and inspect them to see if they remain 5 stars. I am thinking, this would be the PERFECT job for me! But, as I finished the book - I realized that NOTHING is perfect. Not a hotel, not a marriage, not you and not me.<br />Jane's books always give me a little bit more wisdom and a smile as I close the book.	2002-10-08

The book made me sad but intrigued me at the same time. The character feels like she is invisible to everyone at her home, her school, her parents. She's got so much to say, but the words can't come out because she is scared..scared of what people will think of her, scared that her parents will find out an awful secret that she has been keeping for a long time and that nobody will believe her.<br />She gets the courage to express her emotions and finally...speak.	2002-09-30

I couldn't wait to receive this book in the mail...With much anticipation after reading Good in Bed...I am finished. You really feel connected w/the characters Maggie & Rose. They loose their Mother at an early age, have to grow up with a Step-Monster named Sydelle who is addicted to Botox and lead totally different lives. Rose (the not so pretty, smart one) and Maggie (the beautiful, rebellious, say anything/do anyting type). They have a love/hate relationship with each other but learn that the bond that sisters share is a special one despite the problems that they have to deal with.<br />This book should definetley be on your wish list!!	2002-09-30

I found this book to be very dark ~ not at all what I expected with it being a true story. It amazes me that some people can let themselves be manipulated by people to the point of giving someone THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of dollars with nothing in return. You want to track Jennifer down, shake her (not too hard) and tell her to \\"WAKE UP AND OPEN YOUR EYES TO WHAT IS GOING ON!!\\".	2002-09-30

This book was just TOO funny.<br />The story takes place near Boca Raton, Fl where I have had the pleasure to visit. I kept picturing \\"Del Boca Vista's\\" from Seinfield for the atmosphere. Two sisters (one from NY) are reunited after several estranged years to take care of their sick mother. Needless to say, the two sisters have not had the best relationship and can't stand each other. IE - At first when they see each other, one sister compliments the other's dress as looking like a tablecloth.<br />Both sisters are in competition for a handsome and charming doctor, and when they both find him dead in his house - they are suspects in his murder. The sisters are bound and determined to clear their name and find the true killer.<br />Heller lives up to her style of writing which will have a little bit of something for all readers. Laughing, mystery..and just when you think you've figured out what's going on, the plot thickens...	2002-09-14

I wished that I would have bought it used at Amazon rather than new in the bookstore.<br />There are a few LOL moments, but you wonder why Eve is even going to marry Michael? Right up until the end as she is walking down the ailse, she is comparing her experience to what death must feel like.<br />The funny parts include what we women think and experience before tying the knot: \\"What if you get married and you hate it? What if you have an affair? Would he leave you, or would you stay together? What if he has an affair? What if he goes bald?\\"<br />The story is a little jumpy and not focused at all.	2002-09-08

Yes, we've all been there at one time or another. But, she keeps on going on and is bound and determined , \\"I will show him\\".

Strangers come into the sisters lives overnight to help save their coffee shop and turn their world upside down, people are getting killed and you don't know who is to blame until the end.
