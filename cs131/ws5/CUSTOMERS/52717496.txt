(I thought the paperback version might be updated, but it appears not to be.) <br /> <br />The recommendations in this book really intrigued me, although some of them (e.g, EMDR) are likely to be controversial. I did some research on the author and he checks out. His credentials are real. I did some research also into his sources by checking with a physician who has a holistic bent. They check out too. He is drawing on known authorities in the areas of, for example, neurophysiology, and his research is drawn from peer-reviewed journals. <br /> <br />This book does not offer miracle cures but a series of remedies that seem likely to bring improvement in anyone's state of mind: <br /> <br />(1) \\"cardiac coherence,\\" a sort of relaxation technique (oversimplified description) <br />(2) acupuncture <br />(3) EMDR <br />(4) exercise <br />(5) fish oil <br />(6) meditation and <br />(7) fostering social connections. <br /> <br />\\"Curing,\\" however, used in the title, is a less skillful choice than the initial use of the word \\"heal.\\" Anxiety, depression, and stress are chronic, or at least recurrent, states of the modern mind that are more to be acknowledged and managed than totally made to go away (not all stress, for example, is caused by bad things).  <br /> <br />I was already using four of these remedies before I read the book. I learned cardiac coherence easily, I'm about to give acupuncture a try now, based on this book...but I'm still on the fence about EMDR.	2005-04-14

However, the book's real value is that it provides empirical evidence to support Everywoman's anecdotal observations. <br /> <br />What I found most useful about this book is evidence cited that women's \\"tend and befriend,\\" cooperative approach to negotiation results in greater gains in the long run, in part because of women's ability to reframe. It also confirmed my impression that women are more successful in business when they soften their mode of delivery (although not their message). <br /> <br />The authors further reframe the scope of \\"negotiation\\" to include women's personal, including homemaking, lives, to remind us all that equality should not end at the thresholds to our homes. <br /> <br />Ultimately, every negotiator has to find his or her own personal style. This book made me feel just that much better about including lipstick and high heels in my arsenal.	2005-03-07

Some of the reviews listed for this edition appear to have been duplicated by amazon.com from reviews of the first edition in 1993. <br /> <br />My entire practice was transformed some years ago when I adopted the authors' cross-examination-centered method of case preparation as set out in the first edition of their book (Roger Dodd, by the way, is a co-author of the second edition as well as the first edition). Not surprisingly, because the authors' method enables the lawyer to master case facts quickly and efficiently it is as helpful in negotiating settlements as it is in actually trying cases. I will not say that the techniques are necessarily quick or easy--I can recall spending eight hours laboring over questions for a major cross examination that took exactly one-half hour in court--but it produces stunning, consistent, results. <br /> <br />How does the second edition differ from the first edition? Well, the authors appear to have noticed that computers have been invented. The first edition's defiantly Luddite tone emphasizing the usefulness of manual pasteup of criss-cross charts and such has modulated into a respectful acknowledgement of such things as outlining programs and databases. Second, the authors provide many more examples in the second edition of the uses of the methods in complex civil litigation, as opposed to felony criminal trials. Also, although this book is not, and does not pretend to be, a primer on discovery management in document-intensive cases, its presentation of the concepts enables the reader at least to envision how the systems might be applied. <br /> <br />In addition, when I read the first edition I found the amount of information in this book simply overwhelming. Perhaps because the text is not quite as densely crammed into the page, or perhaps because I have been studying this material for years, with the help of a hilarious audiotape of a Pozner and Dodd lecture, the second edition seems less overwhelming. I noticed that the authors' quirky turns of phrase have been somewhat smoothed out, alas (\\"sliding off\\" objections is now described as \\"dealing with\\" objections); simultaneously, a number of minor, annoying typos have crept in, mostly errant commas and subject-verb disagreements. <br /> <br />One additional comment about the physical book--it is printed on heavier paper than the first edition. This is a Good Thing. The first edition was on very thin paper, almost like a bible, which made the pages almost transparent; I nearly wore them out. The second edition is more durable and more readable. <br /> <br />The verdict: probably not worth replacing your first edition with a copy of the second edition (unless you never bought the pocket part update on \\"The Crying Witness,\\" worth the price of the new volume). But if you don't own this book, and you fancy yourself a trial lawyer, what are you waiting for? There are Only Three Rules of good-cross examination, but the Only Three Rules are just the beginning of a durable analytical structure adaptable to all trial work. <br /> <br />	2005-01-03

I have been schooled in the wisdom of \\"original blessing\\" as a corrective for the concept of original sin, and well, I'm a woman. So I thought this book would be right up my alley. Reilly goes overboard, however, in rejecting _any_ attempts at self-discernment as negative. There is such a thing as self-assessment that is accepting, positive, and life-affirming, without necessarily approving of everything that we accept about ourselves.  <br /> <br />In the end, by overlooking the necessary distinction between \\"acceptance\\" and \\"approval,\\" the book limits the possibilities for growth that it can nurture. And that's a shame. It is, ultimately, patronizing to believe that women are too fragile to handle self-critique. We can be our own best critics, but this book won't help. <br /> <br />Conclusion: stand by with the insulin shots while reading this one.	2004-11-26

The thesis of the book is that the act of reading text that represents words phonetically alters the structure of the brain adversely. <br />Leonard Schlain, a vascular surgeon striving to be the Camille Paglia of cultural anthropology, has built a very detailed polemic from a series of post hoc fallacies. That is, he asks us to believe over and over again that an event happening after an earlier event was *caused by* the earlier event. In this case, he associates the rise of alphabetic literacy with not only with the rise of patriarchal monotheism but with violence and a decline in culture. Now, as much as I might like to believe Woman Good, Man Bad, this book just doesn't offer the empirical support to this position that it would like to.<br />Aside from the post hoc fallacies, the author makes false generalizations that I could discern in areas of history in which I am competent. For example, the statements that \\"Prior to the nineteenth century, there had never been a purely religious war fought on Russian soil\\" and that \\"[t]hose that involved religioun were more about territoral conquest than ideology\\" could only be made by one who has not looked deeply enough at what happened to the Old Believers.  <br />Finally, it irked me that Shlain bases his views on assumptions about the right and left brain functions that even he acknowledges may not be true for left-handed people, or women, and even less so (I extrapolate) for left-handed women. As a left-handed woman, therefore, who loves alphabetic literacy, does that make me a gender traitor? An anomaly that does not fit into his elegant theory? In any event, what his theory cannot accomodate, it simply ignores. Ten percent of the population, however, is a pretty big chunk to ignore.<br />Shlain writes entertainingly and obviously has done research in many areas. In the final analysis, however, he has written a highbrow beachbook.	2003-06-30

That way, it would be easy to write in the book.	2003-06-06

The story is told as a confession by Lucifer himself.<br />From this promising premise, Glen Duncan takes the reader on a verbal rocket ride which ends...well, that doesn't matter, the ride is so enjoyable. Duncan is well-versed in literature going well beyond the obvious Blake (whom Lucifer dubs \\"Blakey\\") and Milton, and clearly has a deep knowledge of New York as well as London, modern as well as ancient history. At least in its references this book is surprisingly erudite.<br />The passages describing Lucifer's embodiment into a human being, and his evolving responses to possessing five senses, are realized fully enough to rate this book worth reading just for that vicarious experience. The author's main achievement, however, is his imagining a fully believable, fascinating, and yes, dammit, likeable Lucifer. At once biting, arch, and occasionally oddly touching, Duncan's Lucifer makes P.J. O'Rourke sound like Mister Rogers.<br />If you are easily offended by criticism of the Almighty, of organized religion, and just about everything else, this is not the book for you. If you like your humor without cream or sugar (as for example in the film \\"Dogma\\"), give this book a try.	2003-05-27

Because the cards are assembled from images that have personal resonance, the deck can have an impact that no purchased tarot cards ever could.<br />A very interesting way of making powerful personal art of especial interest to those who have no technical training in art.	2003-05-20

Dieker is a poor man's Scott Turow as he drily depicts his struggles to write his way onto a journal, keep abreast of a torrent of reading matter, and, most important, get a summer job which will lead to a real job. One of the best uses of black humor in the book is the rejection letters regularly quoted in the text, each one more unctuous than the last.<br />The book summoned up the angst of law school for me so effectively that I had a hard time finishing it. That speaks well for the power of the author's writing. Mercifully, he includes an epilogue to assure us that this was long ago and far away and that things turned out all right for him in the end. That's good. By the end of the book, I found I really cared for the protagonist.	2003-03-03

The preface by Rupert Pole (her Los Angeles widower, as opposed to the late Hugh Guiler, her New York widower) notes, \\"Toward the end of her life Anais and I discussed the original diaries, and she asked me to publish all her diaries just as she wrote them.\\" <br />Having now read four volumes of the unexpurgated diary, it is my educated opinion that this was _not_ a good idea. It is unfortunate that Pole has dutifully released this volume of material in this form. It's like he published the first draft of a book--there is so much dross among the gold that I often felt that I was not so much reading as doing penance. It is apparent now that not all the material cut from the expurgated volumes was eliminated because of its scandalousness. If we have learned anything after the sexual revolution, surely it is that even the salacious can be dull.<br />And yet. And yet. Amidst Nin's whiny posturing, her mechanical proclamations of audacity and innocence, nestle passages of such power and beauty (especially starting in 1938) that this volume intermittently becomes riveting. There are also a number of entries where Nin drops her self-glorifying posturing and looks at her own behavior with clear and unflinching eyes. For the first time, for example, I began to understand what she saw in Gonzalo, something that was a mystery to me even from the previous unexpurgated volumes. She becomes enormously likeable when she appears to be displaying some candor. <br />I regard it as truly unfortunate that this book is unlikely to have many readers owing to its lack of editorial discipline. Be patient with it, but be prepared to skim, and don't read it as an introduction to Nin's work.	2003-01-14

However, I must review this book, in part, on whether it achieved its stated objective, which was to provide a comprehensive overview of all of Russian culture.<br />The answer is no. Let's not confuse &quot;long&quot; with &quot;comprehensive.&quot;<br />In fairness to Figes, this book has a lot of strengths, particularly his discussion of the relationship between nineteenth century Russian operas and the texts from which their libretti were drawn, his emphasis on the Old Believer schism, and his treatment of Vassily Grossman, still relatively unknown in the West. However, it has some glaring omissions for a work which wants to be comprehensive.<br />First, Figes basically ignores all literature, architecture, and applied art prior to the period around the founding of St. Petersburg. This means that he fails to address, among other things, the _Tale of Igor_, the literary impact of Slavonic hagiography, icons and their influence on secular painting (other than a lick and a promise to Andrei Rublev's work), and any of Ivan IV a/k/a the Terrible's perorations. This omits a necessary context for the Westernizers (such as Peter I a/k/a &quot;The Great&quot;) and the Slavophiles.<br />Second, I think his treatment of _Oblomov_ would not communicate the importance of this work in the public imagination to anyone who was not familiar with this work, and Figes doesn't even mention _The Precipice_, which Goncharov regarded as his true masterpiece. He also doesn't discuss the rift between Goncharov and Turgenev as a result of the similar themes in _The Precipice_ and _Fathers and Children_. This really was an unfortunate omission. This was big news in the nineteenth century.<br />Third, I thought that Figes did not devote sufficient attention to the nineteenth-century anarchists, particularly those of the upper-classes, and slighted Yurij Dombrosky, though I grant you that these might be quibbles.<br />Fourth, given his emphasis on Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and emigre and returnee literature, I was expecting to see more discussion of Solzhenitsyn, who rates only a cursory mention. Solzhenitsyn's work neatly demonstrates and extends virtually all the points that Figes is making, which is why his failure to discuss him at greater length is so odd. <br />Fifth, there were occasional odd minor lapses in scholarship. For example, at one point Figes notes that the word &quot;robot&quot; is &quot;not coincidentally&quot; similar to the Russian verb _rabotat'_, or &quot;to work&quot;. However, a few minutes with the Oxford English dictionary told me that the first reported use of the word &quot;robot&quot; was by a Czech playwright, Karel Capek, in the play &quot;R.U.R.&quot; released circa 1921, and that &quot;rabota&quot; means forced labor in Czech. In fact, In the days when Czechoslovakia was a feudal society, &quot;robota&quot; referred to the two or three days of the week that peasants were obliged to leave their own fields to work without remuneration on the lands of noblemen. However, that fact does not fit with Fige's theory. It makes me fret about what Figes did in the course of assembling his book with other facts (and artists, such as ones noted above) that do not fit his theory.<br />Finally, his offering of Natasha's dance at the end of _War and Peace_ as the central image of the authentic pure Russian soul revealing itself beneath the veneer of European culture really bothers me. It bothers me because an equally central image of Natasha Rostova and her reaction to Art is Natasha at the opera earlier in the book, suffering _ostranenie_, or a sense of estrangement, from the opera's artifice.  Moreover, the final image of Natasha in _War and Peace_ that Tolstoy creates for us is to show her stout, jealous, with a faint mustache, which has always stuck me as cruel both to poor Natasha and to the patient reader. It begs the question tosay, as Figes does, that Tolstoy's view is simply that Natasha is &quot;estranged&quot; from Western art, therefore it is bad, and that she responds &quot;naturally&quot; to Russian art, therefore it is good. As Figes admits elsewhere in this book, Tolstoy was far more complex in his personal beliefs than this, and his writing improved when he could abandon his didacticism. Natasha's dance and her reaction to the opera are both examples of a Tolstoyan rigidity into which Figes periodically slips.<br />Conclusion: read it together with _The Icon and the Axe._	2003-01-03

(As the major players in Nin's life have passed away, and libel suits have become a lessening concern, her literary executor has begun releasing additional volumes from the same time periods as the expurgated works containing previously suppressed material, which makes talking about a \\"series\\" confusing at times.) Volume Five finds Nin in America after World War II, during the era of the Feminine Mystique, living what has to have been a fairly expensive lifestyle on both coasts, plus Mexico, with no visible means of support. Knowing more of Nin's actual biography than she is willing to divulge in this volume helps in understanding this puzzle--she was married to two men at the time, one in New York, one on the West Coast.<br />This volume appears to have been written with more care than the 1944-47 volume, perhaps because with Nin's second marriage she was no longer spending as much time compulsively \\"ensorcelling\\" younger men. Nin dates her entries by the month or season of the year, and they appear to be written with reflection, rather than in the heat of the moment. This suggests also that the entries may have been more heavily edited, either before they were ever incorporated into the diary or later, for publication. This raises an interesting question for which there is no answer:  If a diary is edited by the alteration of text, as opposed to the deletion of uninteresting or controversial matter, should it still be considered a diary? How much editing can be done before a work becomes no longer a diary but a series of essays? It depends on what the definition of \\"diary\\" is, of course, but I think there is a good argument that this volume is no longer a bad diary, as volume four was, but a fairly good series of essays.<br />A number of interesting events happen in Nin's outer life in this volume that are engagingly described. She goes to Mexico and describes her exotic lifethere quite beautifully. She copes with the death of her mother. She has an interesting literary friendship with James Leo Herlihy more than a decade before his great success as the author of the book _Midnight Cowboy_. She drops acid under laboratory conditions (in 1955!).<br />Nin doesn't seem as whiny about her inner life as she did in volume four of this series. Her ongoing struggles with lack of literary recognition are thus easier for at least this reader to take in stride than in volume four. Nin also appears to achieve some sort of psychological breakthough with her therapist of that period, Dr. Inge Bogner, and, as Nin describes it, achieves objectivity. Whatever it was, she seems less frantic at this juncture in her life.<br />Because Nin has a track record of being somewhat slippery, it is always a great temptation to read her diary volumes in tandem with her letters, biographies...and fiction. Therein lies the rub with her constant complaints about her lack of literary recognition. Although I respect her ambition to show psychoanalytic process in her characters, I just find that she mastered the diary genre much more than the fiction forms she attempted. Read Amy Bloom's and Peter Kramer's fiction, not Nin's, if you want intense psychological fiction, but do read Nin's diary.<br />Verdict: pretty good, but hard to appreciate fully unless you know a lot about Nin and her work.	2002-11-29

As a former Tibetan Buddhist nun, she has a great deal of knowledge of Tibetan practices, and this tape is a somewhat simplified adaptation of an ancient practice designed to help the listener deal with difficult situations and emotions. In even more simplified terms, the listener is invited to visualise his or her demons and then feed them to satisfaction. If this appeals to you, this tape will tell you exactly how to do it, and why, in the Buddhist realm, you would want to do so.<br />Allione's presentation is apparently delivered live, or at least extemporaneously, because she does not appear to be reading from notes, and there are two minor sound difficulties early in the tape where she appears to have turned her head away from the microphone. Allione does not have a particularly appealing speaking voice, enunciating with an odd sort of muffled heaviness most of the time, but the content of her presentation is such that any annoyance at her speaking mannerisms drops away quickly. This tape is both clear and content-rich and I listened to it eagerly several times over the space of a single week.<br />Well worth a listen.	2002-11-09

It is not fluff, but it will probably be more inspirational than educational for those who are beyond the beginning stages of their &quot;yoga journeys.&quot; I give this book three stars only because the content is somewhat elementary and not comprehensive; what is included in the book is thoughtfully selected and carefully laid out.<br />The book is beautifully, beautifully designed and photographed. This goes way beyond the elegance of the author's photographic demonstrations of various poses. The generous use of white space on the fairly heavy page stock gives the contents of the book an air of balance, rather than that of filler.<br />The book addresses a number of topics in addition to asana, pranayama, and ayurvedic topics, and includes a number of personal asides on the role yoga in the broadest sense has played in the author's life.<br />My reviewing credentials, such as they are: I am a more-or-less beginning student of both yoga and meditation and a long-time follower of the high fashion world. I found nothing in this book that was inconsistent with anything I have learned in any of my classes, and a number of tidbits of information that are new to me that fit in with what I do know.

Those who remember the old Wilton cake decorating books will understand why I say that this is not always common in books about decorating cakes.<br />(2) the photos illustrate creative use of color and the text contains charts to explain how to reproduce the effects and generate similar ones on one's own, using the different types of food coloring available, the pros and cons of which are clearly explained.<br />(3) the text explains clearly how to use &quot;wafer chocolate,&quot; which is really a malleable and dyeable form of white chocolate, for truly stunning effects.<br />(4) children _love_ the cakes. My five-old-daughter grabbed this book, studied it cover-to-cover, and then asked me to read it out loud to her. She will actually sit for fifteen minutes listening intently to a description of how to construct the cakes that she likes.<br />This really is a generous book. The cakes are spectacular enough that the authors probably could have found some way to franchise or trademark their designs and thereby made a lot of money. Perhaps they will make a lot of money selling copies of this book (I hope so) but the information is free if you check the book out of the library.

Readers with experience in negotation will find themselves looking up from time to time saying, \\"Oh, that thing has a formal name!\\" For example, the tendency of one party to discount or ignore conciliatory overtures from the other side is called \\"reactive devaluation.\\" Labelling the concepts isn't necessarily of any use in the throes of a negotiation, but can be useful as a guide for analysis, and it was very interesting.<br />Not as simple as _Getting to Yes_, on which it obviously builds (I think all books about negotiation have to use the term \\"BATNA\\" to have any credibility these days), nor yet as complex as _Beyond Winning_, this book does in fact offer a \\"toolbox\\" of strategies for the negotiator's use in analyzing a situation and maximizing the likelihood of obtaining a desired outcome.<br />Of particular note is Watkins's emphasis on identifying and analyzing the interests of multiple players, which is more often encountered in the real world than the one-on-one situations more frequently used as examples by negotiation authors.	2002-07-26

My chief quarrel with the book is that the authors present it as a virtual panacea, which I think overstates their case.<br />After following the technique carefully for some time, I can report the following. Here is its essence: you can deepen your powers of insight and develop a meaningful writing practice by doing the following regularly, several times a week, thirty-five minutes at a stretch:<br />(1) Light a candle<BR>(2) Play Baroque music (the slower stuff)<BR>(3) Write on unlined paper<BR>(4) When meaningful, ambiguous or loaded terms emerge in your writing, always ask \\"What do I mean by _____?\\", which is the \\"proprioceptive\\" question. Proprioception is usually used to refer to our sense of where we are in our own bodies, but the authors adapt it to refer to a sense of orientation in our own minds. <br />The first two are meant to create a sense of ritual. Nice, but hardly necessary. The unlined paper is meant to convey a sense of freedom and spontaneity, and strikes me a useless requirement. The touchstone of the authors' method, and really the only necessary part, is the persistent reflection on what one means by the terms one uses, both as one works through each individual \\"Write,\\" and as one regularly sets pen to paper day after day, month after month, year after year.<br />The guidance this book provides on introducing precision and clarity into one's writing and one's thoughts is useful. A structure that gently encourages insight can hardly be harmful. But many individuals who keep journals for an extended period of time, or who cultivate an unwritten meditation practice, are already writing proprioceptively without candles and Baroque music. <br />The authors' enthusiasm about their technique is odd for something that seems frankly a touch mechanical; the spirits that they invoke are denatured and bland. To write well, write often. The candle is entirely optional.	2002-07-17
US	52717496	R17HSZ5ECYOPIL	1880656671	727002775	Glyphix for Visual Journaling: Drawing Out the Words Within	Books	3	11	11	N	Y	A Fascinating Concept With Some Problems In Presentation	This book describes briefly, in several passages scattered throughout the book, and demonstrates amply, a technique for exploring ideas that the author has dubbed &quot;glyphix.&quot;<br />The first step in creating a glyphix is to represent a chosen word through a drawing. For example, the way the author describes the glyphix for the concept &quot;glyphix&quot; itself (the drawing that appears on the cover of the book above) is that it is the &quot;profile of an eye, open wide with curiosity; the projection from the eye signifies true seeing/understanding.&quot; The author uses a _shodo_ brush and _sumi_ ink to produce elegant characters with an Asian feel, but the editor's introduction encourages readers to use tools on hand. The glyphix is somewhat akin to the symbolism used in American Sign Language and the Word Sculptures of Gabrielle Lusser Rico.<br />The second step (the author is not particularly rigid about the order in which these steps should be followed) is to create a &quot;string,&quot; which is a list of the denotations of the word.<br />The third step is the &quot;exploration&quot; of the word's associations and connotations.<br />There are two problems with the way the above information is summarized and illustrated in this book.<br />The first, which is minor, is that the explanatory text is scattered throughout the book. For me to understand the artist's method required a lot of paging back and forth in the book aside from looking at the illustrations. It struck me as odd that a book about a method of integrating drawing and text wasn't successful in doing so in a didactic fashion. This is an organizational issue, however, and not unusual.<br />The second problem I had with this book is more significant: a flaw in the way the publisher chose to display the glyphix. Many of these truly exquisite drawings are spread across two pages, which means that a good part of the drawing runs into, and is cut off by, the bindings in the center of the book (I think this is called the &quot;gutter&quot; in bookbinder's terms). This seriously diminishes their impact, and the ability of the reader to enjoy and absorb them. Those glyphix that appear on a single page, with explanatory text on the facing page, are much more pleasing to the eye.<br />The choice to make the book smaller, and the glyphix larger, while it may have decreased the cost of the book, impairs the visual value of the art portrayed as well. It's a shame that such a business decision was made in production, because the concept is truly useful.	2002-06-21

This is a book about the process of writing and what it means, especially as a spiritual practice. <br />It is best consumed in small doses as the prose is dense with meaning. It is not dense like a scientific text, it is dense like a poem, not surprising because the author is, among other things, a poet. She is a widely-read one who quotes sources which were entirely unknown to me.<br />Chapters such as &quot;Doubt and the Inner Critic,&quot; &quot;Beginning A Writing Spiritual Practice,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Wordlessness In Writing Practice&quot; (which a less imaginative sort might call writer's block) act as signposts for places that the writing pilgrim might find along the way. My favorite exercise is &quot;Building an Altar of Uncertainty.&quot;<br />This book both invites and rejects comparisons with Natalie Goldberg's _Writing Down the Bones_. Vecchione doesn't give a fig, in the end, what it is that you write, only that you do write. <br />I imagine that the intended audience for this book is writers of poetry and fiction, but there is much in here of value to those whose primary writing is keeping a diary or journal. So do write, Dear Reader, but first, ponder this book.	2002-05-19

An initial word of comment: the author's definition of a \\"creative\\" journal appears to be one that contains drawing as well as writing, which I think shows a limited understanding of creativity.<br />I don't know how else to describe my problem with this book other than saying that everything about it seemed oversimplified. The print is larger than usual in books for adults; the author uses very simple words, simple sentences, and simple explanations; and the total effect, rather than one of clarity, is of an author who believes she is writing for rather dense children. <br />I grant you that simplicity can be profound, and this book contains some occasional interesting insights. Too much of _The Creative Journal_, however, consists of exercises like: \\"Draw the struggle. Give the drawing a name. Let the drawing speak to you\\" (actual quote from page 52). There is no nuance to these exercises.<br />Verdict: not worth the effort. For a broader look at creativity, see works such as _A Year In The Life_.	2002-05-09

I don't recall hearing any press buzz when this book came out, and I can't understand why. This is a brilliantly edited collection of excerpts from diarists both famous and obscure. Some of the most interesting entries were written by total unknowns, including people of whom one would not even suspect literacy. One-paragraph biographies of all diarists appear at the end of the book, for reference. <br />The genius of the editors, which sounds like a gimmick but isn't, is their arrangment of the excerpts by the month and day that the entries were written. Within each day, the entries jump magnificently from century to century, and from author to author, so that the voices that the reader hears, and the perspectives on history and society that the reader gains, are constantly shifting. For example, entries of European Jews in the midst of the Holocaust are juxtaposed with British entries from the same era--and German entries from twenty years earlier.<br />The format makes for more richness of texture than any one diarist could. This book calls to mind Thomas Mallon's _A Book of One's Own_. Mallon's book groups diarists by type, however, not entries by day, and Mallon provides a great deal more commentary than the editors of _The Assassin's Cloak_ do. The Taylors let their own quirky choices of entries provide implied commentary.<br />Warning: this book is 600 pages long, and highly addictive. A must read for anyone interested in diaries and journals.	2002-05-07

The book is full of marvelous ideas great and small, many of which are quite inexpensive. For example, she suggests saving colored foil candy wrappers to smooth out and use as raw material to decorate the covers of books. Now why didn't I think of that the last time I crumpled and discarded a candy wrapper?<br />Morgan presents three categories of ideas: ones to use in decorating the covers of books, ones to use in embellishing the interior pages of books, and ones to use in making unusual books themselves.It has very clear instructions for all the projects, and has many detailed photographs and drawings. Very useful are variations on each idea, so you can see examples of how she takes her concept and reapplies it to make it look totally different.<br />If this book has a fault, it is that papermaking and bookbinding, both of which are described in the book, might each be the subject of detailed treatises much longer than this volume. No matter, this book is an inspiration.	2002-04-29

Two of the groups studied were drawn largely from people of privilege, but the third most assuredly was not. <br />The author became the ultimate caretaker of the data from the largest studies as part of his work at Harvard. As perhaps a sign of the times, the data from that study, which once was recorded painstakingly in ledger volumes now sits in his hard drive (one hopes carefully backed up). Simply learning that these studies existed was an eye-opener for me. What treasures! <br />Though Vaillant happily draws a number of subjective conclusions from the data in the course of this book, he provides substantial information about the objective facts from which his conclusions are drawn. The reader is educated sufficiently to differ with confidence when so moved. The author's periodic confessions of how his views on various study participants evolved of the course of many years is a rather charming demonstration of aging well in its own right. This book is not intended as a scholarly work, however, and the data are not reproduced in full.<br />I thought the descriptions of individuals who participated in the study, disguised though they might be, and of the author himself, to be the most interesting part of the book. Though they prevent _Aging Well_ from being a simple &quot;Guide To Enjoying Being Old,&quot; the participant profiles provide considerable nuance and subtlety as the author ponders the age-old question, how are we to make the best of our lot in life?	2002-04-23

Worse, it lacks a unifying vision. Saying that one is presenting a Christian Biblical point of view about finances isn't enough. The ideas are all over the place and do not develop from chapter to chapter. The book as a consequence gives the impression of being unfinished. <br />This is unfortunate. Although there are other, equally Christian, views of finances that do not rest on the author's premises (women are to be submissive financially, e.g.), he had some things to say that made me think, though I ultimately disagreed with many of his conclusions (this is _not_ the reason for the low rating).<br />For a much deeper look at the wise use of money, I recommend the classic _Your Money or Your Life_ by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robins. It does not have a specifically Christian orientation but it certainly cannot be said to be anti-Christian.	2002-04-18

Trite concept.<br />Except this book has something very valuable. It contains the perspective of a clinical psychologist who elected to obtain fairly extensive cosmetic surgery (for its own sake, not in order to write this book!) and observed herself go through all the emotional turmoil that this produces, which was much greater than she anticipated. She researched the existing literature on the subject, interviewed many patients herself, and then wrote a guide for laypeople to the psychology of the process of obtaining cosmetic surgery--making the decision and dealing with the outcome, good or bad.<br />Don't look to this book for technical information about procedures. That can change from month to month, from doctor to doctor. Together with _Survival of the Prettiest_, this is essential reading for those considering or scheduling cosmetic surgery.	2002-04-03

In this intricately-plotted novel she tackles nothing less than the nature of identity, with a major subtheme addressing how one's identity might change with one's appearance.<br />This book lost several stars in my mind because of its unevenness. Two of the major protagonists are both named Charlotte, but Egan makes the older Charlotte, more cynical and tainted, a much more interesting character than the misunderstood but saintly younger Charlotte. Both Charlottes are tied by their relationship to an eccentric uncle of the younger Charlotte; both Charlottes have a mystery man in their lives (more I cannot say without spoiling the plot). By the denouement where All (or Almost All) Is Revealed, I found myself skimming through many of young Charlotte's travails.<br />This book manages to raise serious questions about the very nature of identity, even when it merely appears to be a gossipy novel about glamorous high-profile life in New York City. It is worth reading for the thoughts it can provoke. I look forward to more works from Egan with more consistently interesting characters.	2002-02-22

The author provides careful detail on her method of reaching goals by (1)visualizing them quite precisely using pictures clipped from magazines and (2) reflecting on what prompts one to select those particular pictures.<br />The techniques are clearly described and easy enough to follow. The insights prompted can be quite surprising, even from magazine clippings, although I wonder if everyone has dreams that can be evoked by magazines. <br />Does this method work? It appears to, for the author and those who she describes in the book. I used the book and began the process four months ago, and although I'm not ready to give up, it isn't a quick fix. In fairness to the author, she never claims that it is a quick fix. <br />This method of discernment and self-motivation is probably most effective for those who process information visually, not aurally or kinesthetically.	2002-02-22

This book is a diamond: brilliant, clear, cold, and hard. <br />The language is particularly remarkable because the credits state that that the English transation of this book was made not from the orginal Hungarian but from the German translation of the Hungarian. It is a double tour de force of the translators' art.<br />Among this work's many charms is the period detail of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the very end of its long run, and an Old World culture that still echoes in memories of the airs and graces of immigrant grandparents. They say that history is written by the victorious (in war); well, although literature is most frequently published by the victorious as well, the vanquished keep on writing, and manuscripts don't burn. <br />As other reviewers have stated, the arresting story line of this book is told in the course of a single evening, but covers the lives of two old men beginning from the time they were boys, and centering an ambiguous act or acts of betrayal which occured at their last meeting forty-one years earlier. <br />There is not a single extraneous word, or wasted image, in this volume. This becomes more obvious upon second reading once one has satisfied oneself that one has solved, to the extent possible, the mystery presented in the storyline. The depth and subtlety of psychological insight that Marai brings to this work is astonishing. <br />The effect is a combination of the film &quot;My Dinner with Andre,&quot; but without the humor, as written by Josephine Hart, the author of _Damage_. What is truly phenomenal to the 21st century American reader is that an author of such power and mastery could have lived and died (in Los Angeles, or thereabouts, in 1989!) utterly unknown until recently.<br />I disagree with comparisons of this author to Proust or Dostoevsky. He is more nearly akin to Pushkin, and this work can stand next to the _Queen of Spades_. You will not regret the time spent reading this book.	2002-01-10

There are explanations for reference in the pamphlet, as well as an invitation to develop new ways of using the wheel. Several pages of additional prompts are thrown in as a bonus at the end. The wheel is well-made, with a place for owner's name, and looks like it will age well, but I have only had mine for a few months as of this writing so cannot say for sure. <br />The element of the random involved with spinning the wheel helps contribute to a sense of spontaneity welcome to any writer gone stale. Having a different technique assigned also nudges the user out of his/her comfort zone. Worth the money if you like to use prompts in journal-writing.	2002-01-07

The rest of each page after the topic is blank ruled paper. When completed, the book is a self-inventory. For people who are not otherwise inclined to keep a journal, this book could be an excellent freestanding tool for self-discovery. As a practical matter, however, due to the thickness of the book and the stiffness of the binding, it is a bit of an effort to write in neatly. This book would have been a lot easier to use if it were spiral- or coil-bound.<br />I actually like this book quite a bit and use the topic suggestions as journal prompts, because it is easier to write in a separate notebook than in this actual volume.	2002-01-04

I suspect, though I have not listened to it, that the audio version of the book is a scream.<br />Second, the bare facts of her autobiography as she tells them are riveting. One has to respect the desire to be true to an authentic self that is different from the norm when it drives an African-American biological male in the South to dress as a female during adolescence. The Lady could easily have been killed on her way to stardom!<br />Third, as a &quot;fish&quot; (biological female) myself, I always learn a thing or two about the nature of Glamour-with-a-capital-G from the writings of persons whose femininity comes primarily from their minds. As Blanche DuBois said, fifty percent of a woman's charm is illusion (or something like that). The illusion The Lady creates is uniquely her own.<br />Finally, The Lady's discussion of why she has not had gender reassignment surgery adds a serious note that is easy to ignore. The Lady Chablis has played well the hand she was dealt in life with more complicated cards than most receive.	2002-01-01

Over the years (I originally bought the hardback) I believe that I have tried at least 75% of them, among my favorites being the guacamole made from peas and the glazed brussel sprouts, of all things. The only recipe that didn't work out for me was the homemade sauerkraut, and the book has a whole chapter on sausages that just didn't appeal to me as a matter of personal taste. <br />But the recipes are only the beginning. <br />As educational as the surprising combinations are, the most valuable aspect of the book is content unusual in a cookbook: Michael Roberts includes a succinct prelimary discussion on flavors and how to marry, oppose, and juxtapose them, each of these verbs representing a different type of combination. For example, lemon and garlic is a flavor *marriage*; sweet and salty, like peanuts on an ice cream sundae, is a flavor *opposition*; and clove and red wine is a flavor *juxtaposition* (tasted at different times or on different parts of the tongue). <br />These three types of combination underlie all the recipes in the book. Roberts takes pains throughout to explain why his combinations work and to offer variations on the recipes. Together with his introductory chapter, this book offers the cook beyond the beginner stage a tutorial in culinary creativity. <br />The adventurous cook will not regret this purchase.	2001-12-14

For reasons set forth below, however, to the absolute beginner I would recommend _Journal to the Self_ or _The New Diary_ as a first book on the subject, not this one.<br />The book has three sections:<br />1. The short opening section offers seven exercises (involving five senses and two literary devices) to limber up the journaling muscles, so to speak. They are well-presented.<br />2. The main body of the book offers extended excerpts from the journals of published writers demonstrating both techniques within the journals that the author recommends to us, the readers, and those published writers' use of journal materials to generate published works. <br />Depending on one's temperament, the quoted excerpts can be either discouraging or downright intimidating. This book for this reason is not a suitable first book about journaling. In addition, in some cases the length of the journal excerpts in proportion to the amount of commentary and guidance that Ms. Bender was providing was somewhat excessive.<br />On the other hand, the excerpts can also be inspiring, make no mistake about that. I found Robert Hellenga's journal entries describing the thoughts and experiences that eventually formed _The Fall of a Sparrow_ to be particularly strong. <br />3. The book concludes with its best section, a short one modestly entitled &quot;add-ons.&quot; It contains a number of additional strategies for journal entries, most of which I had not seen elsewhere, and a chapter on creating journal-keeping groups and communities. <br />Verdict: worth buying if you're a serious journaler; not the best single reference if you only have one book on the subject.	2001-12-10

It is impossible to tell whether this stems from Nin's habit of editing and reworking her material over the years, thus possibly refining early entries until they were on a par with her later work, or whether Nin was simply never able to improve on her first work inspired by her meeting Henry Miller.<br />Deidre Bair's biography of Nin reveals the interesting tidbit that Nin stopped keeping diaries in volume form some time during 1946, partway through this volume. After 1946 (particularly since Nin soon found herself living with two men, one on each coast), she jotted down notes on whatever papers were handy and tossed the notes into manila folders. The decrease in quality associated with this apparent lack of care shows, I think, as this volume progresses.<br />The life she was then leading, although distracting her from the diary, hardly constituted a work of art in and of itself. Nin spends much of this volume &quot;ensorcelling&quot; teenage boys as a woman in her forties. She declares frequently that she identifies with the young, and surrounds herself with them in preference to the rigid folks her own age. A more jaded view of Nin's behavior at this time is that men her own age were able to see through her games in a way that boys did not have the life experience to do. Although she frequently claims tremendous insight and understanding of psychoanalysis, she is ultimately blind to the uglier aspects of the larger patterns of her life at this time.<br />Because this is the expurgated version of the diary, this volume omits a critical event: Anais's meeting Rupert Pole,whom she would later marry, in 1947.<br />Verdict: only for hardcore Anais Nin fans.	2001-12-06

The structure makes the book easy to pick up and put down. There is a deeper continuity within the work as well, as the stories the women tell from day to day, and their reactions to one another, provide nuance to each individual character.<br />How to categorize this book? Should Voznesenskaya be considered a Soviet writer, or a Russian one? She left what was then the Soviet Union in 1980, and this volume was published in 1985. The author therefore falls into that odd category of writers who are in exile, and further and further from the wellspring of her inspiration. The status of the author doesn't make her work less legitimate, simply harder to place in context.<br />Verdict: worth reading, but problematic.	2001-12-01

It is technically well-written and competently edited. The subject matter is distressing and Nin's own stated approach to the subject matter is extremely odd.<br />Nin's own view of herself as ultimately liberated is, I think, self-serving to the point of blindness. I suppose she can be applauded for a refusal to consider herself either a &quot;victim&quot; or a &quot;survivor&quot; of childhood sexual abuse, but her revelling in it hardly seems praiseworthy. This is the voice of Nabokov's Lolita, all grown up and returning compulsively to the taboos which were broken for her before she was of an age to express or understand consent. Therefore she is more to be pitied than scorned, though she probably would not welcome either reaction to her.<br />I became convinced as I read further that Nin was seriously mentally ill. Her viewing her compulsions as her own free choice was a part of her illness. It's a good thing she never raised any children.	2001-11-23

She was moreover a much more interesting writer as a diarist than a writer of fiction.<br />Research that her various, and occasionally vilified, biographers have done documents conclusively that much of Nin's writing was fictive. Nin herself always claimed that she was seeking a deeper truth, not historical accuracy.<br />The debate on this subject will doubtless rage on for decades. Suffice it to say that this volume brings to life an era, and an obsessive love quadrangle (Henry-June; June-Anais; Anais-Henry; Anais-Hugo), that has something for anyone with a pulse. You don't have to like Anais Nin at all to enjoy reading this book.	2001-11-23

Because the letters were sent into the possession of others, they were less subject to the constant revision and reinvention that bedevils all attempts to determine objective facts about the mercurial Nin.<br />If you are not already an amateur historian of literary trends of the 1930's, fear not. The letters are worth reading as an introduction to Anais Nin and Henry Miller as well, for they depict a real-life romance conducted by two who absolutely relished the game and were highly articulate in dramatically different ways.	2001-11-23

Or does it? One can never be sure with Nin.<br />The girl who became Anais Nin, scandalous diarist, was clearly highly articulate, and determined to live a life of Art and Passion, even when her mother was making her do housework as a teenager in their modest rental house in Queens. It provides a  gentle introduction to her life and times, and a fascinating contrast to searing works such as _Incest_, taken from diary material written some twenty or so years later. One also gets some interesting views of early-twentieth century New York City.<br />The book, taken in the context of Nin's later work, offers evidence that we become what we most want to be.

As a consequence, there are many omissions and edits for the sake of discretion. Those omissions were revealed when _Henry and June_, also taken from Nin's diaries, was published after the death of all protagonists.<br />Consequently, a volume that appears to be frank and honest upon a first reading looks somewhat less so when compared with the alternative version contained in _Henry and June_, which contains material expurgated from the first year of this volume. Confused yet?<br />The more Anais Nin slips away from us, the more we seek her. When reading this volume I come to believe that there is something to be said for Nin's position that she sought to portray a deeper psychological truth and the objective facts were less important.	2001-11-23

Professor Johnson presents a number of ideas along this line that I have not seen elsewhere. <br />This book lost a star in my view because, in addition to the lack of bibliography noted by other reviewers, the material about mining the journals is not presented in a well-organized fashion. For example: Johnson identifies ten categories of life patterns that one can perceive in journals past: longing; fear; mastery;(intentional) silences; key influences; hidden lessons; secret gifts; challenges; unfinished business; untapped potential. I found this to be a very helpful analysis, yet it is casually mentioned in the text in a way that is easy to miss and hard to locate again for reference. <br />This book must be mined for insights in just the same way that one mines a journal. It's not a fatal flaw, but I think I expected more in a published work. Nonetheless, it is worth the effort for long-time journal-keepers.	2001-11-23

The author is a professor at a law school in Alabama with numerous law review articles to his credit, so the tone is not surprising. <br />Before he entered academe, however, the author spent nine years practicing law in New York City and is clearly wise to the ways of the big firm world periodically lampooned in places like _The American Lawyer_. <br />This book is largely descriptive and not prescriptive, and at times has an ingenuously horrified tone at the sharp billing practices chronicled through the use of an impressive variety of resources. Nonetheless, most professionals who log their time and use it for billing will find something to make them squirm. <br />Unfortunately the conclusions were only three pages of a 264-page book, and a number of other conclusions were scattered throughout the preceding chapters.

Psychological changes came about in ways that were too abrupt to be believed. The lawyers, without revealing any plot twists, behaved in ways that no ethical lawyer _could_. The computer comments were laughably inaccurate at times (a small gray box described as a &quot;Norton Utility&quot; with a straight face). It's hard to believe that the author is really a lawyer, unless someone else wrote everything but the courtroom scenes. Even the scenes in chambers with the judge didn't ring true. This book mostly reads like a layperson's dream of what being a big-time criminal defense lawyer would be like.<br />You would be better off reading a Scott Turow novel if you are looking for a legal thriller, or even a John Grisham one.	2001-11-17

The Harvard Negotiation Project's Doug Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen create an analytical framework by pointing out that each difficult conversation has three components: the factual narrative (least important), or the &quot;What Happened?&quot; Conversation, the Feelings Conversation, and the Identity Conversation. How each person perceives the Three Conversations will affect the course of the conversation. Insight after insight about how to turn a difficult conversation into a Learning Conversation unfold in this very solid book. <br />I liked this book so much I bought a personal copy (now battered) after reading our public library's copy.

The authors begin by laying the following framework: the dispute involved is a two-party dispute, goods or issues (&quot;items&quot;) are being divided, and the division is a voluntary choice.<br />Within that framework, according to Brams and Taylor, there are four basic ways of dividing items: strict alternation (taking turns); balanced alternation, which adds something to compensate for the disadvantage of going second; one-cuts-the-other- chooses, and &quot;adjusted winner.&quot;<br />The &quot;adjusted winner&quot; situation has three characteristics: it is envy-free, efficient, and equitable. Each of these terms has a specific meaning in this book (the concepts can be hard to keep straight on a first reading).<br />&quot;Envy-free&quot; means that no party is willing to give up the portion it receives in exchange for the portion someone else receives.<br />&quot;Equitable&quot; means that both parties think they received the same fraction of the total items to be divided, as they value them.<br />&quot;Efficient&quot; means that there is no other allocation that is better for some party without being worse for another party.<br />How is this gold standard of negotiation outcome achieved? Ah, there's the rub. First the parties designation the goods and issues in a dispute. Then, each party indicates how much the value obtaining the different goods, or &quot;getting their way&quot; on the different issues, by distributing 100 points across them. Each item is initially assigned to the person who puts more points on it. Then, an equitable allocation is achieved by transferring items, or fractions thereof, from one party to the other until their point totals are equal.<br />The book addresses adequately, I think, the problem of one or both parties being insincere about their preferences (it can be demonstrated mathematically to backfire). However, despite the concrete examples offered of the David and Ivana Trump divorce, the Camp David Agreement, the Clinton-Bush debates, and the Spratly Islands dispute, the reader is left wondering, doggone it, how do I actually assign these point thingies in my next negotiation? And is this method just too fancy to get the folks across the table to buy into? I suspect it probably is.	2001-11-13

The art of ignoring the co-author is an one that this book unintentionally cultivates. Dr. Cutler perhaps unconsciously pays a bumbling Watson to the Sherlock Holmes of His Holiness. Cutler, who is obviously used to being an authority, provides too much of himself into the dialogues with the Dalai Lama. the result is a jarring inconsistency in tone within some chapters. Doubtless including this much Cutler in the book was an editorial decision, but it doesn't work.<br />Once the reader gets used to Cutler popping up periodically to offer his own explanations of the Western perspective, the profundity of the Dalai Lama himself can be seen more clearly. Naturally his material is very fine and provides an excellent introduction to Buddhist practices that can be applied to the benefit of non-Buddhists.	2001-11-12

He was fated to become the Salieri of 19th century Russian literature. Thematic similarities between _The Precipice_, which he regarded as his masterwork, and _Fathers and Sons_, which Turgenev rightly regarded as his, led to a falling-out between the two authors, friends until then. <br />Yet _The Precipice_ is, perhaps because of its slightly campy air to modern audiences, a very enjoyable read today. It features: <br />--characters with programmatic names decodable to those with a basic knowledge of Russian (for example, the heroine is &quot;Vera,&quot; or &quot;Faith&quot;; the bad-boy protagonist is &quot;Volkov,&quot; or &quot;Wolf&quot;);<br />--a plot containing seduction, betrayal, redemption, and secrets of the generation of elders (there's more implied sex here than in all of Turgenev);<br />--serious discussion of ideas that were to set Russia afire within fifty years, much as did _Fathers and Sons_.<br />Not as challenging, perhaps, as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Goncharov is far from a waste of time for the reader with an interest in the impact of philosophy on literature in the nineteenth century.

This profoundly disturbing book had that effect for me.<br />It might be possible to view this book as humorous. Mr. King's years of patient scholarship have unearthed unmarred originals of photographs that he presents with little or no comment next to what are frequently crudely butchered falsifications of those who fell out of favor with Stalin. Particularly in the age of computer photomanipulation, the alterations are initially comical to twenty-first century eyes.<br />As one works through the book, however, the comic effect is obliterated by mute evidence of the sheer numbers of people who were expunged year after year from the historical record. Particularly frightening are the official portraits self-censored by relatives of the now-deceased in hopes of forestalling the same fate.<br />Although not strictly a falsification, of particular interest to me was a picture of the document officially expelling Leon Trotsky from the Communist Party, complete with angry annotations in the margin by Comrade Trotsky himself.<br />I'd like to believe that the very existence of this book and its photographic record, despite the Soviet attempt of many years to rewrite history, proves that no regime can stifle all unflattering facts about itself for all time. But then I wonder in how many cases, about how many people, they might have been successful. By all means, read this book. Be a witness. Remember the dead. But be warned.

In the immortal words of Mikhail Bulgakov (in _Master and Margarita_), &quot;Manuscripts don't burn.&quot; The evidence in the file offers compelling support for the author's conclusions about the most likely facts regarding Rasputin's dramatic life and still more dramatic death. Finding such source material must be every historian's dream.<br />Because Radzinsky has a playwright's rather than a historian's sensibility, however, the book is frequently a frustrating read because he doles the new information out to us bit by bit, amongst other solidly researched but more conventional materials. Therefore I recommend this book without hesitation but warn the prospective reader that the book can be slow going. Persevere.	2001-11-11

New, and particularly noteworthy, was an expanded section containing a point-by-point list of new features of Word, and improved old features of Word (although I disagree with a few characterizations). The text as a whole, however, does not assume that you used previous versions of Word, so novices need not fear. The take-away message from this review is that if you use Word XP in a law firm, you must have this book.<br />Another new feature, and unique to computer books AFAIK, is a chapter on &quot;Document Forensics.&quot; It's handy to have curative suggestions collected  in a single chapter. <br />My chief quibble--I can't even call it a complaint--is that the book appears to have a slight orientation toward users who are word processors in high-budget big firm environments. I would like to see a little more thought devoted to the needs of the sole practitioner attorney producing her own documents without staff.<br />For example, when discussing the Pleading Wizard, the text dismissively says, &quot;Most law firms choose to skip the Pleading Wizard and deploy a third-party solution.&quot; Excuse me? Perhaps most big law firms do, but if so, why? A discussion of the technical problems, and how to circumvent them if you don't want to go third-party after shelling out a lot of money on Office XP, would be in order. I have never seen a technical discussion of how to alter the pleading paper created by the Pleading Wizard, and I can't be the only person who doesn't like the standard options.<br />I also think that the book is a bit thin on its discussion of VBA and of using Word in document assembly with information supplied from a database. Perhaps these topics are considered too advanced for this book's target audience, inwhich case may I beg the excellent authors to consider a companion volume to this work.	2001-11-10

If you can bear the awful irony that this concept presents in a world after September 11, 2001, this book is worth the effort it sometimes takes to read.<br />As other reviewers have noted, Kramer does not hesitate to display his knowledge of other great thinkers. The book modestly does not refer explicitly to the oevure of that great thinker, Peter Kramer (I say this without irony). <br />Two themes that are addressed at length in his non-fiction books, whether psychoactive drugs change the authentic self (_Listening to Prozac_) and how one makes the decision to leave a major relationship (_Should You Leave?_), dominate this book. A reader who has read Kramer's own thoughts on those subjects will sometimes stifle a smile at the way Kramer's thoughts appear in the minds and mouths of his characters in near-didactic fashion. <br />I suspect Kramer wrote this book partly to get his ideas before a broader audience. It is worth the effort to view the explication of those ideas, but Kramer's real strength is in the crafting on non-fiction.	2001-10-10

I have reread this book several times at widely spaced intervals and have found it better than I remembered each time. <br />I think this particular book is also much more helpful to those who participate in negotiations that are less structured than labor or arms negotiations that are highly choreographed than was _Getting to Yes_, which at times seemed to assume that all players in the negotiation would be using the same text.	2001-03-07

I have found this volume the least satisfying of their works.<br />Perhaps this is because _Getting to Yes_ and _Getting Past No_ are so amazingly good that the level of analysis simply wasn't sustainable for a third book. Or perhaps it's I personally tend to think by analogy and had already started applying the concepts in the first two books to non-business settings. In any event, I found the concepts obvious and the discussions banal. <br />The quality of the later books seems to return to the same high level as GTY and GPN. For example, _Difficult Conversations_, though not strictly a book &quot;about negotiation,&quot; is very fine, although not as easy a read as the other two.<br />Bottom line? Useful if you haven't figured out on your own how to apply the concepts of principled negotiation to your personal life. Otherwise, skip it.	2001-03-07

I have always felt, however, that standing on their own the methods of _Getting To Yes_ are a little unrealistic--they assume that the other party wishes to negotiate as well. This assumption is corrected in _Getting Past No_, which may profitably be read in conjunction with _Getting To Yes_ to enable the reader to develop a more useful skill set.	2000-10-19

However, I found that it has been updated very thoroughly to reflect the functional  differences between Word 97 and Word 2000. It remains a very useful  reference for sole practitioners who automate their own document  generation. The reason it only rates 4 stars: I would have preferred a more  robust description of the uses to which fields can be put in automating  pleading (and other legal document) generating.	2000-08-02

Instead, those responses were simply reported, so that one has  to slog through the reportage on all the firms to discern trends.	1999-06-08

Obviously I was not expecting _War and Peace_ from a title like _Boomer Babes_, but I thought it might actually have useful information about, ahem, maturation and style. No, just the authors laughing a little too hard at their own tired jokes. The latest women's fashion magazine--any magazine--is more helpful.<br />Save your money for your old age. Even compounded at five percent it will do you more good than this book.	1998-07-10
