Superheroes have an innate appeal to kids, and photographer Marc Tauss entertainingly taps into that subliminal vein with his visually stunning black-and-white photography \\"comic book,\\" Superheroes, the endearing tale of Maleek, \\"a small boy in a big city-- [who's also] a scientist and a superhero!\\"<br /><br />\\"Maleek loved comic books. It was fun to catch up on his fellow superheroes' adventures.\\" the story begins. It's a relatively simple one, featuring disappearing parks and Maleek's over-the-top solution to the mystery, reveling in the seemingly lost art of a hero being a hero simply because it's the right thing to do. And it's fun! The photography -- the combination of a great eye, superior Photoshop skills, and some imaginative constructs -- is absolutely stunning, each collage capturing both the literal and subtextual aspects of Tauss' childlike fantasy.<br /><br />More important than my enjoying it, though, was Superheroes passing the ultimate test: my almost 5-year-old son liked it, the same kid who typically only likes comics featuring characters he knows from TV, who turned his nose up at Owly, but loves Bumperboy. His enjoyment did come with a qualifier, though, as he explained to his mother: \\"It's not a comic book. It's a book!\\" And a wonderful book it is, a worthy addition to any child's bookshelf, sitting alongside any of Dr. Seuss and Maurice Sendak's best works.	2005-08-22

Pundits expecting Combat Zone: True Tales of GIs in Iraq to be a right-wing smart bomb directed at the hearts and minds of conservative-leaning comics fans can rest easy, as whatever value it may have in that regard is severely undermined by the fact that its one of the most boring comics I've ever read. A dud, literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Originally solicited last November as a five-issue mini-series, it inadvertently became Marvel's first original graphic novel in ages when it ran into multiple delays, a combination of rumored difficulties finding an artist for the \\"controversial\\" story and, presumably, low pre-orders. War comics are a tough sell in general, but coupled with the taint of right-wing propagandist, Karl Zinsmeister, editor-in-chief of The American Enterprise, it seems Combat Zone was DOA and Marvel is now simply cutting their losses with this release.<br /><br />Supposedly depicting \\"real-life accounts\\" of soldiers from the 82nd Airborne during the opening days of the war in Iraq, Zinsmeister opts to change names and combine events \\"for a more condensed read,\\" undermining the credibility of the \\"True Tales\\" aspect of the story. It's similar in intent to what the Army did with the initial story of Jessica Lynch's capture and rescue - dutifully regurgita..., I mean, reported by the embedded journalists covering the war - except he fails to deliver any of that ultimately discredited fable's emotional impact. Whereas Lynch's experience was a great story because of who she was and how she handled things, especially in helping the whole truth come out, there's not a single three-dimensional character in Zinsmeister's collection of cardboard ciphers for the reader to care about. As a result, the difficult decisions, heroic actions and tragic casualties all ring hollow, feeling too much like plot points in a low-budget, by-the-numbers Hollywood movie. \\"True Tales\\" or not, without an emotional center to ground things, he ends up with a disappointingly shallow effort that's a disservice to the men and women he's attempting to represent, seemingly much more focused on hammering home the point that America plays by the rules and the Iraqis don't, and showing off our technological superiority.<br /><br />Dan Jurgens offers Zinsmeister little help on the visual side of things, seemingly phoning it in with little effort put towards distinctive, or even consistent, character designs, making the \\"Cast of Characters\\" roll call at the beginning of the story all but useless. His page layouts are relatively static, rarely varying his camera angles, especially in the many panels of clumsy exposition, though in his defense, Zinsmeister doesn't give him a lot to work with.<br /><br />Whatever side of the ideological fence you may be on, there is some great story-telling potential in the concept, True Tales of GIs in Iraq. Unfortunately, whatever Zinsmeister's talents may be as a journalist, they do not translate into compelling sequential art. Taken at its word, the back cover's hyperbolic blurb - \\"Combat comics are taken to a whole new level!\\" - suggests Zinsmeister may be the first writer to achieve boring and unnecessary in the genre. If Marvel's intent behind this series was to show support for our troops, they'd have been better off making a donation equal to its production costs to a charitable organization like No Greater Love instead. Same goes for anyone considering dropping $19.95 for Combat Zone; put your money to better use.intingly shallow effort that's a disservice to the men and women he's attempting to represent, seemingly much more focused on hammering home the point that America plays by the rules and the Iraqis don't, and showing off our technological superiority.  <br /> <br />Dan Jurgens offers Zinsmeister little help on the visual side of things, seemingly phoning it in with little effort put towards distinctive, or even consistent, character designs, making the \\"Cast of Characters\\" roll call at the beginning of the story all but useless.

Simple character designs and minimal detail give Bumperboy the visual appeal of a newspaper comic strip, and Debbie Huey's effortless humor and casual pacing are evocative of the best Nickelodeon cartoons. Bumperboy and his dog, Bumperpup, wear some sort of full-body suit that makes them look like astronauts, and live in a world inhabited by, among other characters, a sock-wearing bear, a pair of bananas, and a malicious bird, Frederick, who'll stop at nothing to win the big marble tournament. It's Frederick who causes Bumperboy to lose his marbles in a \\"borp hole\\" hours before the tournament begins. Borp holes are teleportals that randomly send Bumperboy to places throughout Bubtopia as he tries to find his marbles, particularly his shooter, a legend in his family, given to him by his grandmother who won several tournaments with it.<br /><br />I've never played marbles in my life, never had the slightest bit of interest, and yet Huey makes the 56th Annual Marble Tournament as compelling as last year's Yankees/Red Sox playoff series, including a bit of a similarly unexpected twist in the results at one point. That she doesn't take the most obvious route to get to the ending is both appealing and her least notable achievement here.<br /><br />I repeat: SHE MAKES A MARBLE TOURNAMENT COMPELLING! IN A COMIC BOOK!<br /><br />Bumperboy Loses His Marbles has jumped into my Top 10 list for 2005 and I recommend it to everyone without qualification. Buy it, read it, love it.

Scott Beatty's The Batman Handbook: The Ultimate Training Manual, opens with the following disclaimer:<br /><br />\\"Attempting to exact vigilante-style justice is illegal, no matter what the situation. Even Batman himself, if he really existed, would be subject to prosecution, despite his close relationship with Commissioner Gordon... We urge you to obey all laws and respect all rights, including the property rights of others -- even the criminally insane.\\"<br /><br />DC's lawyers not only know their audience, they also have a sense of humor, something that's fully on display in Beatty's entertaining How To guide. Broken down into five chapters - The Basics, Bat Skills, Fighting Skills, Detective Skills and Escape Skills - Beatty offers up a realistic look at the caped crusader's methods and gadgets, along with a heaping helping of pure fanboy snark. Important information like how to make a Batsuit, how to drive the Batmobile on two wheels, and how to take out a roomful of goons is all presented in relatively straight-forward fashion, with real-world examples and common sense explanations, and frequently cut with wry observations such as: \\"Camouflage can save your life. Only a virtually invulnerable hero who operates in the daytime would wear bright blue, red and yellow.\\"<br /><br />Formatted like an actual training manual, it's very similar in tone to the Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook series, an oft-hilarious guide to surviving such potential disasters as escaping from quicksand or performing a tracheotomy. Besides explaining which martial arts are best to master and how to withstand poison kisses, The Batman Handbook is also rich in references to Batman history, making it a double treat for the fanboys and girls. In Chapter 5's \\"How to Win a Coin Toss,\\" for example, Beatty briefly recounts Two Face's origin before suggesting, perhaps to future writers of the Dark Knight: \\"If your life is at stake or, more importantly, an innocent's fate is to be determined by the flip of a coin, you might be better off using the time it takes to toss a coin to launch an attack or slip from your bonds... Then decide the outcome yourself -- with your fists.\\"<br /><br />Batman's appeal has always been his universal relatability due to his lack of super powers. He's just a man - albeit an extraordinary man - the self-made hero that any of us could be if we had his willpower and drive, and of course, his bazillion dollar family fortune!

Technically a Batman-family title, it is the one that is simultaneously the least and most reliant on the Dark Knight's presence, one that looms heavily over every story arc even if he himself rarely appears in them.<br /><br />\\"RENEE MONTOYA HAS A SECRET.\\" says the back cover blurb rather coyly. Specifically, she's a lesbian, a truth she's kept from her parents, her fellow officers, and her current partner, Crispus Allen. When she's outed and the man seemingly responsible turns up murdered, her backup gun found at the crime scene and incriminating evidence at her home, she finds herself under arrest and fighting not just for her job and her reputation, but for her life when help comes from a most unexpected source. Unexpected in the original run, at least. In this trade collection, DC generously includes two reprinted stories - all for only $14.99! - that serve as preludes (one from Batman Chronicles #16, the other from Detective Comics #747, both written by Greg Rucka but not illustrated by Michael Lark), shedding light on and setting up what originally seemed like an out of left field situation for those not well-versed in Gotham continuity.<br /><br />The strength of this collection lies not in its overarching plot - solid though it is, despite some elements that suggest a fondness for Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels - but in its three-dimensional characterizations and smart dialogue, a trait that marks much of Rucka's work, both in comics and his novels, particularly when it comes to strong women. From the conflicted Montoya and her deeply predjudiced parents; to her arrogant but stand-up partner, Allen; to the bigoted taunts of her fellow officers, including the female ones, Rucka manages a realistic, nuanced take on a potentially exploitative subject, without any of the heavy handed objectifying, glamorizing or proselytyzing that one might expect in a relatively mainstream comic book. (Or, say, from Mark Millar.) Montoya works as the emotional center of the story, more about her than her sexual preference, because Rucka has given her multiple layers and not simply settled for a cipher on which to hang his story, an important factor that makes the ending work as well as it does, even when Batman and one of his classic rogues gets involved.<br /><br />Gotham Central in general, and the \\"Half A Life\\" collection specifically, are stellar representatives of the best the form currently has to offer.of her fellow officers, including the female ones, Rucka manages a realistic, nuanced take on a potentially exploitative subject, without any of the heavy handed objectifying, glamorizing or proselytyzing that one might expect in a relatively mainstream comic book.

Confident and steady, with an eye for the occasional detail that never slips into drawn-out minutiae. Tales from Fish Camp is a well-written series of short, energetic anecdotes, the kind you can picture Henderson telling friends over drinks at the pub. Unfortunately, there's not enough content to justify an actual book. Generously listed at 120 pages, more than half of them are blank chapter separators. In a few cases, 1-2 page chapters are separated by as many as 5 blank pages! Considering their reputation for publishing graphic novels, you'd think AiT/Planet Lar would have at least commissioned an artist to flesh out Henderson's Tales, but no, there's not a single image in the book. Save your money and get a taste of Henderson's writing on her blog, instead. If she ever publishes a novel or a weightier collection of short stories or anecdotes, though, I'll be first in line to pick it up.	2005-04-01

Without warning, Venture returns, crash landing at the Space Center with only its catatonic Captain onboard, bringing with it the mystery of its whereabouts for the past 10 years. Where has it been? Where is the rest of its crew? Why is it still intact? And why the hell is it covered in skin?<br /><br />A story like this obviously hinges on a willing suspension of disbelief, something that itself hinges on the sincerity and believability of the characters, and it is there where Ellis shines, with Colleen Doran's emotive artwork and Dave Stewart's muted coloring bringing his exuberant story to vivid life. The primary characters - the Astronaut Corps veteran, the whiz-kid scientist, the depressed psychiatrist, and the traumatized Captain - are all one step removed from Armageddon clich&eacute;s, but it's a significant step, the difference being the obvious fondness Ellis has for the subject matter, a palpable sincerity that graces every single panel and accentuates the emotional crescendo of its uplifting conclusion.ious fondness Ellis has for the subject matter, a palpable sincerity that graces every single panel and accentuates the emotional crescendo of its uplifting conclusion.	2005-03-21

An entertaining salsa of genres, Dave Wilkins and Kevin Munroe have created an engaging superhero whose wearing of tights makes sense for once as El Zombo Fantasma was \\"the most famous and notorious Mexican wrestler on the planet.\\" A villain, actually, the kind the crowd loves to hate, and he feeds off the attention, basking in the spotlight. He's murdered after taking liberties with a title match he's paid to throw, losing by disqualification instead of taking a fall, delivering a brutal move on the champion, Captain Courageous. When his murderer approaches, he at first mistakes him for a hypocritical fan, \\"asking for my autograph after spitting on me at the show.\\"<br /><br />Fast forward a year, key moments of his life flashing before him as he falls into some sort of purgatory, and El Zombo is presented with a deal: \\"Let me make this just as monosyllabically wrestler-friendly for you. If you no help girl and be good, you come back here and you go to hell for rest of... um... oh, yes... time.\\"<br /><br />The girl in question is Belisa Alejandra Marguerite Consuela Chi-Chi Montoya, a 10-year old spitfire and one of the most wonderful characters to pop up in comics in ages. While El Zombo's name is on the marquee, this is as much Belisa's story as his, and like Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense went toe-to-toe with Bruce Willis, she more than holds her ground here as her own destiny is intertwined with her unorthodox, revenge-seeking guardian zombie.<br /><br />Munroe spins a fun tale, compact but not light, with more character development in a 3-issue story than many comics deliver over several years' time. These are characters you care about and, when the story ends, want to see more of. Wilkins' character designs are distinctive and his layouts are as energetic as the Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat vs. \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage's bout at Wrestlemania III.<br /><br />Hopefully there's a chance we'll see new adventures of El Zombo, and his precocious ward, Belisa, sometime in the near future.Belisa, sometime in the near future.	2005-03-03

Collecting The Sentry's five-issue mini-series, along with the five subsequent one-shots, Sentry: Fantastic Four, Sentry: X-Men, Sentry: Spider-Man, Sentry: Hulk and Sentry vs. The Void, this has to be one of the most overwrought, anti-climactic, and ultimately pointless marketing stunts ever. [Marvel claimed The Sentry was a long-lost Silver Age creation of Stan Lee's that pre-dated the Fantastic Four.] To reinforce that fact, it includes a series of \\"interviews\\" between Stan Lee and Marvel EIC, Joe Quesada, that plays along with the hoax; reprints of various Wizard articles that ran in support of it; and a note from Wizard Staff Writer, Chris Lawrence, vainly attempting to rationalize the whole thing: \\"The goal wasn't to mislead anyone or betray anyone, but to get fans to further suspend their disbelief, to lead them to better appreciate the intricacies of Paul Jenkins' plot, to help them have fun.\\"<br /><br />Gee, I remember when it was the quality of the work in question that got fans to \\"suspend their disbelief\\" and \\"have fun.\\" Silly me!<br /><br />The mini-series introduces Bob Reynolds, a potbellied, alcoholic schlub who wakes up one stormy night remembering he was once the greatest superhero the world had ever known, and the realization that his greatest enemy had returned. What follows is a mildly intriguing piece of Rashômon-style meta-fiction that tells the story of a superhero no one remembers and the reasons why.<br /><br />The whole thing is one big fanboy circle-jerk as writer Paul Jenkins has a good time with this ridiculous - though, at times, clever and entertaining - retcon of the entire Marvel Universe that makes Straczynski's recent \\"Sins Past\\" sullying of the sainted Gwen Stacy look timid in comparison. The mini-series and the final one-shot, Sentry vs. The Void tell the meat of the story, from Reynolds' efforts to figure out why no one remembers The Sentry - including the various heroes he fought alongside, many of whom even attended his wedding, not to mention Peter Parker whose photograph of The Sentry won him a Pulizter Prize! - to the final confrontation with his arch-nemesis, The Void. The other one-shots flesh out various characters' memories of The Sentry through some achingly navel-gazing exposition that mostly serves to reinforce just how great a hero The Sentry was.<br /><br />One could argue that the story's conclusion, with the Sentry once again forgotten, is a dig at Superman himself, taking the stance that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, and as such, a being as powerful as Superman (or the Sentry) would necessitate an equally powerful evil that would ultimately doom the world. It's an interesting concept that Jenkins pulls off more in the subtext than on the surface.

Comic book writers are a special lot, even among creative types, fitting somewhere between performance artists and mimes in mainstream perception. Whereas Mark Salisbury's excellent first edition, published in 1999, featured many of the Modern Age's future Hall of Famers - including Warren Ellis, Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller and Grant Morrison - Tom Root and Andrew Kardon tap the current crop of writers dominating the industry, including Brian Michael Bendis, Andy Diggle, Mark Millar and Brian K. Vaughan. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, it sees fit to only include one female and not a single writer of color in the bunch.<br /><br />Interspersed with script samples and highlights of specific titles they're best known for, the real meat of the book is the interviews themselves where the writers discuss craft, inspiration and the business of comics, while offering - not always purposefully, I think - glimpses into their personalities and motivations. At times these glimpses can be turnoffs, and other times they can uncover a previously unknown and interesting layer.<br /><br />While many of the writers have achieved mainstream success at various levels, there's a few purely independent creators like Dave Sim and Jill Thompson represented, too. Several of them are also successful beyond the world of comic books, having written novels and screenplays - and, in Kevin Smith's case, directing well-known movies - making this a great resource for aspiring writers of all types.<br /><br />The honesty of the writers is often refreshing, like Ed Brubaker admitting that \\"sometimes it gets tiring writing a company-owned character when you have ideas for them and the company tells you no.\\" Or Greg Rucka admitting his Elektra series \\"feels like a failed experiment.\\"<br /><br />Overall, its continued lack of diversity aside, Writers on Comics Scriptwriting 2 is another strong volume from Titan Books and I only hope there's not another five year wait for the next edition.

There is something simultaneously appealing and frustrating about Ernesto Quinonez's second novel, a marked improvement over his highly-flawed debut, Bodega Dreams, but in the end, still something of a disappointment. This time, the problem lies in his biting off more than he can chew with too many subplots rolling around what is essentially one man's coming-of-age story at its heart.<br /><br />He's inexplicably combined the systematic burning of Spanish Harlem, insurance fraud, organized crime, gentrification, Santeria, pseudo-socialism, illegal citizenship papers, a shady government agent and a few other random nuggets into a muddle-headed plot that rests precariously, and unsuccessfully, on a straight-out-of-Hollywood interracial romance...and frankly, he's just not up to the task. When the cliches aren't jumping off the page at the reader, the heavy-handed didacticism is smacking them in the face.<br /><br />His protagonist, Julio Santana, is a philosophizing arsonist yearning for the old days while trying to turn his life around after the proverbial \\"last job.\\" Almost every other character is either an archetype or a stereotype, none ever fully coming to life beyond the \\"issue\\" Quinonez has chosen them to represent. After some hit-or-miss character and plot 'development' in the first two-thirds of the book, the hasty climax gets sloppy and, just like in Bodega Dreams, includes an out-of-left-field occurrence to wrap things up. The too-convenient epilogue only makes matters worse.<br /><br />That said, Quinonez is no hack and with a less ambitious plot that focused more on the characters he obviously had a connection to, especially the engaging babalawo Papelito, he could have had something really special here. Personally, I could see a viable sequel springing from this effort, focusing only on Julio's journey to his Asiento, his strained relationship with his parents and a fleshed-out romance with Helen and the issues that arise from it. The first two things represent the strongest aspects of Chango's Fire, while the latter's potential got buried in melodrama.ings represent the strongest aspects of Chango's Fire, while the latter's potential got buried in melodrama.	2004-12-10

And in the first six issues of this reloaded series, they got three more artists to work with, not to mention five of the most trite, uninspired covers on the stands any given month. (Issue #3's cover was decent.)<br /><br />This opening story arc, Choosing Sides, begins by explaining everything that's changed at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, with Cyclops and the apparently reformed Emma Frost serving as the new headmasters of the school; a cursory reintroduction of the New Mutants that reduces each of them to standard team book stereotypes; and, presents their first adventure as a team in the Danger Room. Standard stuff for a first issue, but even accepting that as a necessary evil, there's something missing from the overall package.<br /><br />That spark of sincerity that made DeFilippis and Weir's short-lived New Mutants run work so well is clearly dulled, as if the corporate-mandated reload as a \\"team book\\" sucked the joy from it for them and they're now going through the motions. In issue #2, you get a sense that they're determined to work in some of the more interesting themes that were hinted at before the reload, but in the structured confines of an official \\"team book,\\" they come off feeling forced and insincere. ie: The prerequisite hothead, and hottie, Noriko, is given an Afghanistanian roommate, Sooraya, complete with burqua and traditional beliefs, and they clash for a couple of panels of simplistic rhetoric. You get the impression that there was something left on the cutting room floor; that pre-reload, this two-page encounter would have been a primary sub-plot that would weave it's way through the series as they explored the ever-present subtext of mutants as minorities.

Joshua Middleton's beautiful cover art featuring some of the women from the original lineup drew me in, and Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir's patient, nuanced introduction of the first mutant of the new generation, and their reintroduction and use of a tortured Danielle Moonstar as the story's anchor, kept me glued through to the last page.<br /><br />The closing dialogue sealed the deal for me:<br /><br />  Sofia: What's Xavier's like?<br /><br />  Danielle: Like no place else in the world. You'll see.<br /><br />While I didn't love Keron Grant's interior art, nor his uneven trio of inkers, there was something in its intent that worked for the tone of the story. Over the next 5 issues, DeFilippis and Weir made good on Danielle's promise, consistently delivering the goods by capturing that tricky combination of teenage angst and super-heroism that Marvel Comics seemingly trademarked ever since Stan Lee came up with the idea of a nerdy science buff bitten by a radioactive spider, but that so few mainstream comics are able to pull off today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this series was derailed by the X-Men Reloaded marketing stunt and relaunched as the vastly inferior New X-Men: Academy X.	2004-12-05

Vaughan has crafted a parallel New York City that feels absolutely real and populated it with 3-dimensional human beings that go far beyond comic book stereotypes - a legitimate spiritual descendant of Alan Moore's Watchmen. Summarizing the plot would be selling it short, because there are multiple layers at work here - superheroing, politics, the human condition - and Vaughan's barely scratched the surface so far. If there was ever a comic book that could seamlessly transition to traditional fiction, this is it. Unfortunately, that would mean missing out on Tony Harris' eye-popping artwork.<br /><br />For anyone that thinks comics are about men in tights and cartoonish \\"BIFF! POW!\\" visuals, Ex Machina will set them straight. As a native-New Yorker, I'm jealous that there's no Mitchell Hundred for me to vote for mayor. As a comic book fan, I'm glad to see a book like Ex Machina being published regularly, and to much-deserved critical acclaim.	2004-12-01

The A-Team with a Three Kings edge, Andy Diggle writes intelligent action entertainment better than anyone, and his cynical take on world affairs gives this series a realistic, sharp edge that's missing from most other stories in this genre. The characters may be a bit generic, but like a B-movie with A-list actors, Diggle's scripting lifts each of them above their stereoypical cores. And Jock? His jagged, bombastic artwork evokes the hyperactivity of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The Losers is my high-octane, not-feeling-the-least-bit-guilty pleasure every month and this collection of issues 7-12 is the perfect way to get a healthy dose of one of the best ongoing series in comics today.	2004-12-01

To be honest, most of the differences people have pointed out don't even ring a bell for me; they just feel right, suggesting a natural evolution of the game. It's definitely much more complex now, with an intense attention to detail that can be intimidating, but it's all designed in a way that lets you customize the game to your own liking.<br /><br />And, most importantly, it's still fun to play. Unlike video games, most of which are designed around an individual experience, a D&D game is a collaborative effort that encourages creativity and social interaction from every player. The only boundaries are those of your collective imagination.<br /><br />This gift set is the perfect way to get back into the game, too, combining the three core books that include all the information you need to create characters, design adventures and populate them with an array of monsters to slay. There's even information on incorporating miniatures into the game, offering a visual aid for those who can't fully make the leap from video games.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of thinking D&D is either too complex for kids (my 9-year old niece plays), or too simple for adults (I'm 35). It's a highly-flexible system that can be easily tweaked for the enjoyment of all ages.<br /><br />The occasional typo aside, the books themselves are well-designed hardcovers and the authors present the material in an engaging way that goes beyond simply explaining the rules of the game. All three books actually represent entertaining reads in and of themselves, something that's not always the case with role-playing publications. These are the cream of the crop.	2004-11-30

Where most D&D supplements are basically window dressing for the core game, Libris Mortis opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for your campaign. Whether it's the basic approach of simply bolstering your current setting with some interesting new undead monsters and Prestige Classes; or opening things up by allowing your PCs to play as Vampire Sorcerors or Mhorg Barbarians; or creating an entire campaign set in a world where the undead rule entire kingdoms and the living cower in fear - Libris Mortis is a comprehensive toolkit for making it happen.<br /><br />Besides the requisite supplement fodder of new feats, spells and prestige classes, Libris Mortis includes great background material and full information on Undead Monster Classes (as opposed to high-powered templates from the Monster Manual) for creating undead characters with full level-by-level progressions. There's also a short but interesting chapter of new equipment (including undead armor and grafts), a slew of new monsters, and some great ideas for incorporating it all into your campaign.<br /><br />Libris Mortis is arguably Wizards' best core supplement yet!	2004-11-24

Tinsman has put together a respectable, if somewhat lightweight, overview of the industry with brief glimpses at the backstories of some of the more successful games and their inventors that's most appropriate for the gaming aficionado.<br /><br />NOTE: If you're interested in video game design, look elsewhere.	2004-11-15

Greg Rucka's primary strengths are his characterization and pacing and in SMOKER it all falls perfectly into place. His protagonist Atticus Kodiak returns, still aggravatingly introspective but immensely compelling, as does Rucka's social commentary and intricate plotting. With a tobacco industry whistleblower as the principal, Rucka gets a little heavy-handed at times with soapbox monologues but because his characters are so well-defined and the plot makes sense - something that hobbled FINDER at times - it works without feeling forced.<br /><br />Kodiak's supporting cast is particularly strong this time around, with \\"John Doe\\" and Jeremiah Pugh stealing the show whenever they're on stage. If Rucka ever scores a movie deal, this is the book I want to see on screen.<br /><br />KEEPER was a strong debut. FINDER was a solid, if over-the-top follow-up.

Combining a fully-developed metropolis, a massive dungeon and a number of side quests in and around both, with more than a dozen key NPCs, Kenower and Webb have delivered a product equal to some of the best WotC sourcebooks. It's both comprehensive enough to build an entire campaign around, and flexible enough to pick and choose elements to add to existing campaigns. Granted, some of the plotlines are rather generic, but that's forgiveable. What's not is its editing, or lack thereof, as the number of typos and spelling and grammatical errors is terrible! Despite that, it's worth the price of admission.	2004-09-18

(3.5 stars) Some things are presumably too horrible for words and one would think Burroughs' childhood, as presented here, would be one of those things. If this were a fiction novel, I'm not sure it would have worked as anything other than pointless farce. As a memoir, though, it is extremely disturbing and only Burroughs' humourous, matter-of-fact recollections allowed me to get through it. Several times I laughed out loud while reading it, immediately followed by a grimace of extreme discomfort. It is the proverbial train wreck come to life, and as much as you want to turn away, Burroughs maintains a steady grip throughout. Part of me still wants to believe he's exaggerated some things for dramatic effect but there's a melancholy sincerity to the tone of the book that suggests otherwise.	2004-09-13

Kodiak has issues and I still think he's implausibly young for what he does but this time that actually plays into the story somewhat as his relative inexperience - not to mention his immaturity in dealing with relationships - is highlighted when he comes up against the SAS, in what is basically an extremely over-the-top custody battle.<br /><br />Like Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series, Rucka earns a suspension of disbelief because he's so good at developing his characters. If there's one flaw, it's the same problem KEEPER had, with New York City feeling a little too sterile. The names and places are all correct but there's a certain something missing, that something that Block does so well in making the City a living, breathing character as opposed to simply a backdrop.<br /><br />All in all, another strong, if flawed, outing and I look forward to reading the next installment in the series.	2004-07-14

Rucka seems to be known for his research and he's apparently done his homework here as the overall scenario rings true.<br /><br />The story's backdrop, New York City at the height of the mid-90s anti-abortion protests and clinic bombings makes for a enthralling plot as Kodiak is charged with the protection of a pro-choice doctor. Rucka unself-consciously tackles the sticky politics of the situation, offering welcome shades of gray in what is often a black and white topic, while delivering a taut thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat through the end.  An excellent first novel and I'm looking forward to reading the next one in the series.	2004-07-12

(Another 3.5 rating) Halfway in, I was thinking 3 stars at the most as it's so blatantly a marketing piece for some of WoTC's newest game supplements - specifically, the Expanded Psionics Handbook and Serpent Kingdoms - but it actually got better as it moved along as Smedman proves to be a pretty decent writer. Relatively speaking. This is solid hackwork, following the D&amp;D formula to the letter. As a fan, that's not necessarily a bad thing as she works the formula well. The main character, Arvin, is a bit annoying at times, though, and his primary motivation - rescuing/avenging a friend - isn't really made believable until nearly the end of the book. Worthwhile read for fans of the Forgotten Realms, but anyone looking for innovative fantasy is better served by Jessica Rydill's work.	2004-07-03

After his first two books - quirky and sharply written, deftly straddling the imaginary fence between fantasy and literary - Ruff made an interesting decision in choosing his subject matter for his third novel. Instead of taking the &quot;easy&quot; route and returning to a fantasy setting, he steps into the real world, choosing a difficult premise, and delivers his best story yet.<br />While his first two books showed off his ability to handle large casts of distinctive characters and their overlapping stories, he flips the script here by focusing on two characters, both of whom house large and distinctive casts IN THEIR HEADS.<br />Describing the plot doesn't do the book justice as, like any worthwhile journey, half the pleasure is in getting there, and this book is a rare pleasure, indeed. In the end, Andy Gage and Penny Driver will be two people whose lives stick with you long after you reluctantly put the book down.<br />Matt Ruff has done it again!	2004-05-27

(3.5 stars) This is the first Salvatore novel I've read, coming to it cautiously thanks to his reputation, and I have to admit to it being better than I expected.  Considering it's the first book of a new trilogy from an ongoing series, it was a fun read with a reasonable amount of character development and just enough action to get me looking forward to the next one without feeling like I'd read an extended prologue.<br />I loved the dwarves, especially Pikel the \\"Doo-dad,\\" and Salvatore writes them quite well, giving each of them a distinct personality.<br />On the other hand, the biggest disappointment was the infamous lead, Drizzt, whose intermittent letters and incessant navel-gazing made him a rather annoying presence in the story.  The parallels to racism and interracial relationships are rather heavy-handed and do nothing to really define the character beyond its archetype.  Salvatore seems to be leaning on past stories a bit too much to carry that particular storyline.<br />Overall, though, this book was a lot of fun and I am intrigued enough to check out some of his other books while awaiting the sequel.	2004-01-05

Part of that is definitely the hype effect as I'd heard so much about Neil Gaiman being this amazing writer that it was next to impossible for him to blow me away. The stakes were too high for that.<br />The book does suffer from a bit of self-indulgence as Gaiman throws everything he can into the 588-page...epic? Road trip? Love story? That's another part of the problem. The book is ostensibly one man's story being told against the backdrop of some rather grandiose events, but at times it feels like it's actually a patchwork of random short stories that couldn't quite stand on their own. And the ending falls somewhere between cheap bait-and-switch and outright letdown.<br />Getting there is fun, though, not unlike a two-week relationship full of (...), drunken philosophizing and a clean, no-strings-attached parting of ways, self-respect still intact. I'd hesistantly recommend it for those looking for something - different? - but with a hearty caveat emptor.	2003-10-22

This guide flips that tired, off-putting approach and instead, starts with the students' own work, introducing and clarifying poetic devices they already use, slowly slipping in the work of others.  The exercises are many and varied, their recognition of and focus on performance is impressive and the inclusion of several poems and anecdotes by students of the program is crucial.<br />If you teach poetry, or even if you just write it yourself, this book should be on your bookshelf.	2002-01-16

I wrote an earlier note on this under a different account but just wanted to add to that under this new account. I first came across Willie and his work live at SOB's back in 1996, right before this book was published. I'd been to a couple of poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and enjoyed them but hearing Willie was the first time poetry ever really connected for me. I FELT what Willie was saying - related to it like he was one of my boys - but at the same time realized that THIS WAS POETRY! It was a revelation for me as a fledgling writer looking for my own voice and, as a more established writer these days, I can honestly say that that is the most you can hope for from your writing - to touch someone deeply. Buy this book now!	2001-07-16

I first read this book shortly after it was published and was in the process of realizing how much I wanted to be a writer.  Not only did it strengthen my resolve on that front, it has long stayed with me as an excellent example of well-crafted plotting and ensemble storytelling.  Ruff gives each and every one of his characters a distinct personality, making the humans, the animals and the fairies all feel three-dimensional.  I've reread it five times, recommended it to everyone who will listen and look forward to there never being a movie version!	2001-07-16

But too many cliches and an anticipating-the-movie-deal ending betray this vibrant debut from Quinonez.  At times, the prose flows smoothly and realistically and you can feel the grit and intensity of life in Spanish Harlem.  Other times, the cliches are simply too overwhelming.  A farout plot twist at the end ruins the whole thing.  I look forward to his next book.	2000-12-18

The Gillan's have compiled and arranged an eclectic selection of work from a great combination of poets both well-known and should-be-better-known.  Broken into five thematic &quot;chapters,&quot; it is laid out like a narrative, with different poets effortlessly flowing into one another and can be read from cover to cover like your favorite historical novel.	2000-12-18

This anthology is a solid collection representing a wide range of voices STILL involved in the National Poetry Slam scene. Unfortunately, many voices are left out precisely because they are no longer involved in the scene which weakens the collection's importance as an historical document. Nevertheless, the poetry selected, along with the mixed bag of essays, makes this an invaluable supplement to ALOUD, still the king of &quot;poetry slam&quot; anthologies.	2000-12-11
