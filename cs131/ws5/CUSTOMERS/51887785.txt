Girl is now the extremely popular manager of the famous and more &quot;Vegas-like&quot; Kit Kat Klub.  This time, Girl is using her supernatual powers to establish a safer and better world for the average &quot;working&quot; girl.<br />Similar to my compliants about Girl: Rule of Darkness, this book is shorter than the original.  This book is part one of a four book series.<br />Again, similar to Rules of Darkness, the scenes are not quite as explicit as the original. Some of the more outrageous scenes (like demonic coupling) are done in silhouette.<br />The illustration is rough and not particularly sophisticated. However, it's crude format matches the content fairly well. The subject matter is extremely explicit and Taylor uses the power of illustration to show scenes that could never happen in real life.  If you are looking for sophisticated illustration, try Eric von Gotha instead.	2002-05-24

If you are into erotic graphic novels, Erich van Gotha is bound to be one of your favorites. His illustrations are beautifully realistic and the action is harsh and hardcore.<br />The Education of Sophia tells the tale of an impressionable young woman that is lured into a life of sexual excess.  Handed a mysterious book on the arts of love from a fleeing stranger, Sophia is titillated into exploring the \\"seedier\\" side of town.  Starting from self pleasuring, she sinks into activities starting at glory holes and ending in BDSM group scenes.<br />Safe sex advocates will be disappointed at the lack of concern for AIDS and disease prevention but that won't slow down most fans.  The PC police will not like the implied lack of consent in some of the scenes.<br />The Education of Sophie contains the best elements of his previous works, the BDSM from the Troubles of Janice and Special Prison, with the great group action and corruption of innocence in Twenty.	2002-05-24

In the book, he asserts that changing attitudes about sex and the family (triggered by the pill) are ripping away the moral fiber of the country.  Easy access to birth control, frequent divorce and acceptance of homosexuality all signal the decline of western civilization.<br />With an upswing in birth control and abortion access, he traces an attendant decline in the birth rate of European-Americans.  Coupled with increased immigration from nonwhite countries, Buchanan predicts soon future citizens \\"will spend their golden years in a Third World America.\\"<br />In order to save America from the \\"coarseness of her manners, the decadence of her culture, or the sickness in her soul,\\", Pat Buchanan believes America must reevaluate itself and reclaim its European (read here \\"white\\") Christian values.<br />Well written, the book quotes a fair number of official sources to bolster it's arguements.  The statistics are accurate and well researched.  Most readers will not find themselves disagreeing with the facts that Mr. Buchanan has assembled.  Most, however, will disagree with the questionable conclusions that he draws from them.  In addition, the facts that directly support his major assertion that America should be \\"re christianized\\" are lacking.<br />I think that Mr. Buchanan has missed the mark in saying that a nation that was founded on freedom and religious tolerance should be closing it's borders and governing itself via an official state religon.  This wasn't right when the Taliban ruled Afganistan and it isn't right for America.	2002-02-14

The book is somewhat short and does not cover a very wide spectrum of play, however, it does provide a good overview of the basics.  If you are looking for a &quot;how to&quot; book of techniques, you are better off with a book like SM 101 or Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns.<br />However, Ms. Califia does an excellent job at examining the psychology and spirituality of BDSM play.  She intersperses her words of wisdom with a few well chosen fantasies that help new players to get a feel for how BDSM scenes might work.<br />In the first chapter of the book, Ms. Califia provides four short stories to lubricate the imagination.  The second chapter covers a very important part of play - communication and negotiation.  The third chapter covers the techniques and psychology of bondage.  The fourth chapter describes different types of sensations to experiment with.  The fifth chapter covers whipping and flogging.  The sixth chapter deals with sex in a BDSM scene.<br />The end of the book contains several appendicies which cover topics such as cautions on contracts, a glossary of terms, a reading list and a resource list.<br />Overall, this book is an excellent, non threatening introduction for people wishing to experiment with BDSM play.	2001-07-13

They have distilled the results of these experiments into a series of easy to follow, sure fire recipes that rarely fail to delight.  Even if you using a different cookbook, the description of the techniques (what worked versus what failed) will help you modify your recipe for even greater success.  The descriptions of the testing process and the science behind the results are fascinating reading that will make you a better cook.   If you have ever wondered if there is any truth behind some of those &quot;kitchen secrets&quot; that people swear make a difference, then this book is for you.   <br />The book covers all types of food preparation (soup, salads, vegetables but not vegetarian, pasta, meats), grilling, baking (pizza, breads, cakes) and desserts.  It is also liberally sprinkled with the results of taste testings and equipment reviews which I have found to be pretty accurate.<br />Like many people, I usually only try 2 or 3 recipes out of the cookbooks that I buy.  I have tried 2-3 recipes out of each of the twenty chapters in this book.  This is a &quot;must have&quot; cookbook.	2001-07-06

Written by unabashed fans of meat, it is an extremely well done specialty cookbook.<br />The book begins with a description of the history of meat production in North American and how it impacts the way we need to cook meat.  It then moves on to described detailed cooking methods and to which cuts of meat these methods apply.  I found the advise in this section to be very valuable.<br />Then for each of type of meat (beef, pork, lamb, veal) the book describes the type of cuts available, how to buy the best of each type of cut and how to use each cut.  The come the recipes.<br />Each recipe is broken down into the flavouring step (usually a rub or marinade) and then detailed cooking instructions.  The recipes do not follow the cooking school approach of providing a master or basic recipe followed by variations.  Most of the recipes stand alone, although the authors do make suggestions on where to use which rubs/marinades with which cuts of meat.  In addition, the book details preparation time, appropriateness for entertaing or budget concious recipes.<br />The recipes themselves are absolutely delicious and use readily available ingredients.  I know that I often only make 2 or 3 recipes from a given cookbook.  However, I have made almost every recipe from this one.<br />Overall, this is an excellent specialty cookbook.	2001-07-06

Our hero infiltrates this world with the intention of exposing it's horrors but finds himself seduced by the thrill of absolute power.<br />This book is rough and raw.  It has many scenes of non consensual sex and bondage.  If you are looking for a sensitive treatment of how a woman would feel as she is subjected to the will of an unrelenting master - you are not going to find it in this book.  This book is written completely from the viewpoint of a neophyte male discovering the joy of total domination over helpless young women.<br />I believe that some readers will object heavily to male oriented, mysognist viewpoint of the book.  Others (most likely men) will find it to be exciting.  The book is fast paced, there is enough of a plot to keep the reader engaged between sex scenes and it is well enough written (although no literary masterpiece) to make for an enjoyable read.<br />Just remember, this is a fantasy book and it's depiction of women is not accurate.	2001-07-06
US	51887785	RZ018XM8FJZJR	0786705507	668235280	Seduced	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Strange combination	There are two completely disparate novels contained in this publication.  They are so different in both style and content that it is tough to believe that they were both written by the same person.<br />The first novel is the story of a viriginal young woman that is forced to hire a detective to track down her errant younger sister.  With only the missing girl's diary as a clue, the hardened detective leads the innocent young woman into an underground world of hedonists, ready to devour the naive girl.  This book is passably written, the scenes are interesting but the characters are stock and hard to believe.  The heroine sucumbs too quickly and begins performing unbelievably hard core feats with little encouragement or time to adjust.  The book would have been more interesting if the author had spent more time on her &quot;fall from grace&quot;.<br />The second book is the tale of Roman's senators wife and the debauchery that takes place when you through soliders, gladiators, vestal virgins and little conflict together.  There are fewer sex scenes and very little description given in this book.  Some of the sex scenes feel like they were gratuitously thrown in and almost disrupt the flow of the novel.  I had trouble finishing the second half of the book.<br />Overall, the first book was worth reading but the second is somewhat boring.	2001-07-06

Black Adder aired as four individual series of six episodes each: The Black Adder, Black Adder II, Black Adder the Third and Black Adder Goes Forth.  It does not contain the Xmas special.<br />The screenplays were written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean, Not the nine o'clock news) and Ben Elton - possibly one of the funniest modern writers.<br />In the first series, Black Adder is a weak chinned, effeminate heir to Richard, Duke of York. Set in medieval England, we are introduced to two of the most often recurring characters in Black Adders live(s) - Percy and Baldrick. Lord Percy is an eager to please, high strung dolt. Baldrick, an filthy peasant that is under qualified to be the village idiot, acts as Black Adder's golfer. Although funny, the first series may miss an American audience with some of it's historical references.<br />In the second series, Black Adder's next descendant is no longer heir to the throne but remains one of Queen's dearest friends. Set in Elizabethan England, we get to follow Black Adder as he plots to carouse, fornicate and steal his way to pleasure. Even funnier than the first series, Black Adder gets far more clever. We are also introduced to two additional, recurring characters - Melchett and Flash. Melchett is a pompous, over bearing palace sycophant and Flash is fast moving ladies man with more than just a sword hanging between his legs.<br />Black Adder's fortunes have considerably fallen by the Third Series, where he is now serving a butler to the Price Regent of England, the stupidest man in the land. Again, the clever Black Adder schemes to raise himself at the expense of everyone around him. Other great English comedic actors Hue Laurie, Robbie Coltrane and Tim McInnery all make appearances.<br />In the fourth and final series, Black Adder finds himself caught on the front lines of World War I. Trying to eke out a comfortable existence without being sent out on a suicidal charge against the Kaiser, Black Adder's fourth series is somewhat reminiscent of Mash. Without all the nice doctor's off course. This series has the &quot;crudest&quot; humour of all.<br />Black Adder is undoubtedly one of the funniest English comedy series ever made and the screenplays are worth owning.	2001-06-21

Tart is an adult graphic novel about a young girl whose insatiable desire for sex infects everyone who comes in contact with her.  Strangely, every scene of intense sexuality ends with some form of violence, with a frustrated onlooker or participant resorting to fists or guns when they can no longer satisfy their sexual needs.<br />The technical skills of the artist are average.  Better than many other Eros comix but paltry in comparison to van Gotha, Duvet or Noe.  The majority of the illustration is in simple B&amp;W ink drawing, however, several pages are in full colour.<br />The problem with Tart is wierd anatomy of the main character.  Tart is anorexic, with mishapen breast and a deformed clitorous.  She is visually unappealing.	2001-06-20

This work affords an opportunity to peer into the life of one of the few people whom have had the courage and strength to devote themselves to true 24x7 servitude.<br />However, you should be prepared for the fact that a slave's journal is not intended to be literary masterpiece and you will often find yourself wishing for more detail about events or the thoughts of others.<br />It is rare to get a real, unhyped view into the hardcore S&amp;M scene, which makes this book potentially interesting.

Had I read the book first, I would have never bothered seeing the movie, which is much better.  Given the time constraints of the movie, the screenwriters had license to eliminate some of the more annoying elements which ruined the book.<br />I believe that Simon and Schuster elected not publish the book, not because it was too controversial, but because it is boring and in desperate need of editorial polish.  Ellis has followed in the traditions of Marquis de Sade in taking activities that are repellant and titillating and then repeating them monotonously to make an obscure point.<br />Much has been made of Ellis's satirical look at the 80's in this book.  His primary device for doing this is paragraph after paragraph of mundane details about music, television or fashion.  Once that you determine that this tirade of arcana is unrelated to the subsequent text, you will find yourself skipping over these pages.<br />Ellis also devotes considerable page space to listing the designer names that the main character is wearing that day.  However, rather than providing any form of description, the reader is worn down with list after list of designer names.  Used once, this device may have provided some insight to the shallow, image conscious nature of the main character.  However, it's repeated use is clumsy and inelegant.<br />I suspect that the majority of readers are drawn to the graphic depictions of sex and violence in the book.  The sex scenes are short, brutish and utterly within character for the protagonist.  They are not sensual or erotic, but either one of these two traits would been out of synch with the rest of the book.<br />On the other hand, the descriptions of the murders in the book are best described by the term &quot;pornographic&quot;.  Each killing takes several pages to work through, in which the horrors inflicted on the victim are lovingly described in blunt, graphic terms.  Just as is donein cheap porn, each atrocity is worked over and over using the same basic terms.   Done once, this may have been another interesting literary device, but it is so overused in this book it become desensitizing and dull.<br />Overall, if you enjoyed this book then admit that you liked the sex and violence.   But please don't claim that it is a literary masterpiece or anything other than violent smut.	2001-06-15

This makes the book unsuitable for the 13-17 year old age range.  For those 18+, the book will titillate but not deliver.

Body Heat contains stories about Girl, a lusty lass that is more than happy to satify the boys, two or three at a time, at her high school.  We also meet Blue, a boy with a third leg and a bevy of beauties following him around.  And Jill, a pretty girl working her way through college, puts in a cameo appearance.<br />The distinct Taylor illustration style remains constant through out the book . Some people will not like the thick lines and the physically impossible anatomies - if you are looking for realistic illustrations then von Gotha or Duvet are better bets. However, the crude, exaggerated illustrations match the super hard core story line.<br />If you enjoy stories about beautiful girls that can't get enough satification and have inhuman sexual stamina, then Taylor delivers. If you are looking for cutting edge art or sophisticated plot then you are better off with a different book.	2001-04-26

Her sex crazed crew members let a couple of harmless nymphos loose for a little fun.  But when the nymphos let the real psychos go free, the crew is hacked apart.<br />Armed with only her stun gun and the inmates psyche profiles, the captain is forced to become their fantasies in order to lull them into a sense of security until she can stun them into submission.<br />This comic book is painted rather than drawn and better quality than many other books of this nature. The story line is basically a vehicle to move from depraved scene to depraved scene and is obviously translated.<br />The content is even more obscene than Kevin Taylor's Girl. There are scenes of torture, rape and violence throughout the book. This book is not for the faint hearted. However, if you are turned on by extreme pornography, I have not found another artist who delivers more hard core images.	2001-04-25

When looking for one of these books you are presented with a bewildering array of \\"experts\\" and \\"specialists\\", each with their pet theories about where men and women come from or what \\"rules\\" you should apply to your relationship.<br />It is rare to find a book written by an author with solid academic credentials and years of clinical practice.  This book is one such find.<br />The book is organized into three parts.  In part I, Dr. Hendrix describes the type of relationships most of us have - \\"Unconscious Marriage\\".  In this section, he details how our childhood experiences, self image and ideals of romantic love combine to create an unstated power struggle between spouses.  Often many books stop at this point, assuming that the reader can now go forth and solve their problems.  Fortunately Dr. Hendrix continues.<br />In the second part, he describes what a more fulfilling relationship might look like, the \\"Conscious Marriage\\".  He describes how to begin with commitment, stop destructive exit patterns, creating a zone of safety, understanding yourself and your partner, how to begin real self growth and containing rage.  He closes by providing two examples of marriages that have been transformed by applying these techniques.  The exercises and approaches described by Dr. Hendrix are hard.  His most meaningful techniques are not quick tricks but require a lot of introspection and self awareness.  As he mentions in his book, many couples may require external assistance (we did).  However, his techniques provides lasting changes in the way that you interact with your partner.<br />The final part of the book is a series of exercises that help drive how the major points in each chapter of the preceding two sections.  Relevant and helpful, their main point appears to be to draw the reader into applying the theories presented in the book to their own situation.  In this respect, they are helpful.<br />We have tried a number of different books/techniques to help our relationship and we found this one to be the most helpful by orders of magnitude.  I hope it works well for others	2001-04-10

The heir to the Noble House trading company, established in Tai-pan, travels to Japan to expand the fortunes of his great company.  However, the new heir is not a strong as the great Dirk Struan and the rivals of the Noble House conspire to destroy it.  All this treachery is set against a backdrop of terrorism and diplomatic intrigue as the warlords of Japan conspire to take advantage of the presences of the \\"gai jin\\".<br />This book has the murders, battles, rapes, natural disasters and convoluted politics that are the hallmarks of Clavell's writing.  However, just like the Noble House heir, the book starts off wounded and never really recovers.  Unlike many of Clavell's other books, there is no strong lead character to really carry the story, and as a result, it does not move as smoothly or as interesting as his previous books, Shogun and Tai-pan.<br />Unfortunately James Clavell has set the bar a little too high with his previous novels and this one isn't quite as good.  Still, if you are a fan, it is worth reading.  If you have never read a Clavell novel, pick up one of the others first and you will appreciate his writing more.	2001-04-10

Set in exotic, imperial China, this book is full of action, intrigue and adventure as we follow the exciting quest of Dirk Struan, a larger life English trader, as he drives forward to establish the British in Hong Kong and himself as the chief ruler - Tai pan.<br />A tale of intrigue, conspiracy and murder, with a touch of sex thrown in - the plot is fast paced and engaging.  The characters are bold and colorful and, most importantly, have considerable time to develop and flesh out during course of this lengthy tale.<br />I am not an expert in Chinese or English history so I can not vouch for the authenticity of Clavell's details but the book is full of historical tidbits about customs and attitudes of both the colonial English and the Imperial Chinese.  The rich and detailed narrative really helps the book &quot;come alive&quot; and further involve the reader.<br />Overall, this book is an engrossing read.	2001-04-10

Girl is now the manager of the Kit Kat Klub and having a little trouble &quot;finding relief&quot;.  Unfortunately for Girl, some friends of her demonic possessor from the first book have come back with vengenance in mind.<br />This book is shorter than the original Girl and the scenes are not quite as explicit as the original.  Some of the more outrageous scenes (like demonic coupling) are done in silhouette.<br />The illustration is rough and not particularly sophisticated. However, it crude format matches the content fairly well.  The subject matter is extremely explicit and Taylor uses the power of illustration to show scenes that could never happen in real life. Some people will not care for the scenes with the semi bestial demons, others will be interested in it's &quot;over the top&quot; nature.<br />If you are looking for novel about a sexually uninhibited woman, who is open to anything and always ready for more, you are going to love Girl. If you are looking for sophistication illustration, try Eric von Gotha instead. If you are looking for complex characters and plot, try Laura Rees.	2001-03-27

If you have no programming or computer science background at all, then this book would be considered an intermediate text and you may wish to try one of the SAMS learning series books instead.  However, if you have any background in programming, this book will help you acquire the nuances of using Visual Basic with Access. <br />The book takes a very practical approach of walking the reader through the various elements of how a VBA application is structured and developed.  The chapters are:  Designing Applications, Events, Creating Code, Flow Control, Objects, Recordsets, External Data, Reports, Advanced Techniques, Error Handling, Class Modules, Optimization, Libraries, OLE, Internet interfaces and miscellaneous notes.  Using a consistent sample application, the reader is walked through each step in the construction of a VBA application.<br />I find that the use of single demo, which builds upon itself, to be much more effective that snippets of code and incomplete/unrelated examples.  With little effort, many of the techniques in the sample code may be modified to fit your own needs.<br />Overall, the book is a good text as well as reference for sample code.  It is not organized as a reference text (use the online help instead).

I found it to be a brutally honest, although somewhat apologetic, view of the world of professional wrestling.<br />This book chronicles Mick Foley's rise through the ranks to become one of the longer lasting stars of the wrestling world.  I believe that fan and non fan alike will enjoy Mick's candid observations about what goes on behind the scenes at wrestling matches, the impact's of a wrestler's stage persona on his children/marriage and the kind of dedication it takes to make it to ranks of big entertainment.  For non wrestling fans, such as myself, the sections in the novel that detail major matches and wrestling story lines will drag a little.  However, these sections do not detract significantly from the overall interest of the book.<br />Mick Foley is a natural storyteller and obviously passionately devoted to his chosen, for lack of a better word, art form.  This makes for an interesting read.	2001-03-19

The final chapter in the book provides a very generic project template for how to select and implement your first convergence project.<br />The technology descriptions are very brief, and while they provide a decent overview, there is absolutely no depth.  The basic buzzwords are covered but very little in terms of real world implementation experience or industry issues are covered.<br />The practical implementation details are left until the final chapter.  However, it only provides a basic Systems Development LifeCycle methodology approach that could be used for any development effort.

I find most books are written from an academic perspective that rarely addresses what &quot;should be done&quot; rather than what &quot;could be done&quot;.  As a systems integration professional, I found this book to be one of the few useful books that address the difference between a single person coding effort and a large scale development project.<br />The book is organized in three major parts.  &quot;Part I - The Basics&quot; covers language details, common design patterns, style conventions used in the book and the fundamental design practices to be used in every C++ project.  The next two sections cover the real &quot;meat&quot; of the information.  &quot;Part II - Physical Design Concepts&quot; covers components, physical heirarchy, levelization, insulation and packages.  The techniques in this section are designed to improved testability, reduce compile time and improve version control/configuration management.  &quot;Part III - Logical Design Issues&quot; addresses the marriage of solid physical design with key design/architectural issues.<br />The book is well written and easy to follow.

Set in a universe where independent planets face conquest and suppression by a theocratic government and punitive slavery is enforced by biomechanical devices, Ms. Matthews relies on interesting moral conflicts and well written characters rather than complex scientific gadgetry to tell her story.<br />Given the strong psychological suspense and not so subtle sexual undertones, this book seems more like a BDSM novel than straight science fiction.  Either way, this book makes an engrossing read and I would recommend it quite strongly.	2001-03-19

Initially I was uncertain that I would like this book due to the fact that it was a series of short stories rather than a complete novel.  However, the individual short stories are held together by a plot line dominated by a political battle within the Marketplace that defines it's very essence.  This subplot helps maintain coherence and moves the novel along very well.  <br />The only other fault that you may notice is that some of the references are dated (such as describing the coming return of Hong Kong to China).  But nothing serious enough to ruin the enjoyment of well written prose.<br />For those readers that fell in love with the BDSM classic, the Story of O, there has finally come a series that treats BDSM as more than just a cheap trick to sell poorly written porn. This book is well written, has identifiable characters and an interesting premise. Lara Antinou is a frequent guest at many BDSM conferences. I believe that her premise taps into the desire of many of BDSM scene (whether they go the events or just dream at home) that there is a group of people out there that take the leather scene a little more seriously than your average S&amp;M aficionado. It is just a little exciting to think that if you can shine as a truly powerful Master or well behaved slave, that you may be allowed into a special clique of true devotees.<br />In addition to her well conceived premise, the characters in the book are well developed and interesting to read about. And while you may or may not identify with the disciplined Chris Parker or the self indulgent Michael, they sure would be a lot of fun to meet in the proper setting.<br />Just one note of caution, if you are not comfortable with male bisexuality then you may not enjoy this book. Otherwise I think that you find it is a welcome break from aggressive, badly written fare that passes for BDSM novels.	2001-02-22

Each project has instructions, a materials list, cost estimate, time estimate and a picture.<br />The pictures are useful to see the end product, the instructions are easy to follow, the materials lists are good to get your started and the cost/time estimates are fairly accurate.  I am not a big believer that cheap S&amp;M toys are a good idea as a I believe that they somewhat ruin the \\"ambiance\\" of a scene - many of these toys could not be mistaken for anything but a cheap substitute.  However, if you can't afford the exorbitant fees charged for many S&amp;M toys, this book contains may reasonable and safe alternatives.<br />Despite my reservation about cheap toys, the book was worth more than it's cost simply for the dungeon furniture layouts.

The most extensive section has a series a lessons which are organized around specific types of service:  sex, maids/valets, house servants and escorts.  The final section, advanced lessons, deals with the practical realities of the tricky issues associated with full time (i.e. live-in) relationships. <br />Because it covers a wide range of service, it does not dwell at any length upon a particular specialty.

It contains short features, poetry and a few individual sketches.  Some of the longer pieces include:<br />Red Time - a short story about a young man, Gehenna, who is possessed by hallucinations caused by a seemingly harmless metal box Stunner - a tales of lesbian domination Circes House - the feminization of a young man Brahma - a woman can't stay away from a genetically modified dog left in her care Vague Terrain - a sexual encounter where everyone has a different orientation<br />This book is executed in Manning's heavy, black line illustration that is very reminiscent of Japanese wood cuts.  His story lines are either very simple (straight sex) or very convoluted (SF mixed with SM). I prefer his longer works (Spider Garden or Hydrophybian), which allow the plot to develop more meaningfully.<br />Overall, both the illustration and writing style are uniquely Manning.  If you are not offended by the pan sexual or bestiality themes, these books are extremely interesting	2001-02-19

Warning, I am going to give away the secret of the supposed one hour orgasm - foreplay.  I bought this book, skeptical that there was some hidden technique that would lead to some new level of physical arousal.  And my skepticism was deserved as the book contained absolutely nothing new or informative....<br />Basically, the book is written to help people with a rigid upbringing become more comfortable and relaxed with their body and by extension, their partner's body.  If the book was marketed as a basic guide to developing a healthy, sex positive attitude, I may have rated it higher.  However, it is not sold this way.  It holds out the promise that there is some sexual \\"magic\\" that can occur to rocket your sex life into overdrive.  This book is years of date for most people and is basically same type of exploitive nonsense as advertisements that start with SEX SEX SEX.  The authors should be ashamed of such a cheap ploy to sell this book.	2000-12-31

Our beautiful heroine is attacked late one night by a mystery assailant, so she sets off into the industrial wastelands, chauffered by her pony girls, to search for answers.  Along the way, she meets a very lucky stable boy name Hyu and her treacherous sister Tranceptor, Ravanna.<br />A little short on plot, it has all the Manning signature elements of high quality illustration and incredibly inventive settings.  The scenes and the characters are original and beautifully rendered.  This book has something to appeal (or offend) almost everyone - elaborate costumes, ponies, bestiality, female bisexuality and good old hardcore sex.  Interesting and inventive - I can't wait to see the next book in the series.	2000-12-31

He has sections on avian dominatix's, a tranditional female domme, canine submissives, strap one service, maids/sissy maids, ponies and finally a variety of bestial beings engaging in sex.<br />Michael Manning is famous for high quality, imaginative erotic illustrations with BDSM and pansexual themes.  This particular book is a catalog of various themes that repeat themselves in his other novellas.  Interesting if you already like Manning. Otherwise, start with Tranceptor (mainly hetero stuff) or Spider Garden (more pan sexual - i.e. if you are homophobic it might bother you).	2000-12-31

To begin, it walks through the terminology, the basic mental and emotional elements in SM play, an overview of \\"scene\\" and how S&amp;M relationships can be negotiated.  Once the book has prepared you with the basic elements of how to enjoy S&amp;M play, it moves into actual techniques:  a safety overview, waxing, bondage, flogging, spanking and humiliation.  It finishes with a discussion of how to build, transport and hide your dungeon \\"toys\\".<br />Even if you are an experienced scene player, it is unlikely that you are conversant with every possible type of play, so this book serves as a helpful reminder of the basic techniques.  While it does not cover the more extreme types of play - water sports, blood sports or mummification, it is comprehensive in it's coverage of the most standard types of play.<br />Although this book is written by a hetero male dominant and a female submissive, the words of wisdom contained are applicable to everyone.  I personally found that having both partner's perspective was very helpful when trying to construct my own session.<br />If you are looking to get into S&amp;M, this book is a great start to begin play at home.  Miss's Abernathy's Concise Guide to Slave Training is an excellent next step.  And once you are feeling confident in your private relationship, SM 101 by Jay Wiseman will give you enough credibility to feel comfortable in visiting \\"public\\" scene events.	2000-12-31

Once you have read and practiced the techniques in books such as SM 101 and Screw the Roses, this book is a fantastic collection of ideas for you to set up and negotiate your own S&amp;M relationship.  Written in two parts, first the book deals with the various techniques of training your slave - interviews, journals, forms of address, postures, commands, types of services and ornamentation.  The book then deals with D/S relationships - what to look for in slaves/Masters, the ethical treatment of slaves and the different types of slave arrangements.<br />Written in elegant, gracious style which is reminiscent of Emily Post, the tone is very consistent the content of the book, making it even more effective and fun to read.  This book is an excellent &quot;mood setter&quot; for two people to read together.  Overall, this book is a engaging read and excellent addition to your BDSM library.	2000-12-31

This is fantastic if you are sitting down for a good erotic \\"read\\", however, it is more problematic if you are contemplating trying to act out your SM fantasies.  Fortunately, readers now have access to a non-titillating , realistic guide to SM play.  Jay Wiseman is an experienced SM player and a popular lecturer/speaker at many BDSM events and his book, SM 101, has condensed down his years of scene experience into a very readable guide to SM play.<br />It is somewhat of a `technical manual' that explains SM terminology, the mechanics of `erotic pain' as well as how to use clamps, bondage, flagellation, erotic torture and humiliation.  The second part of the manual introduces the reader to SM organizations, SM relationships and how to construct specialized types of scenes.  This book is a definite must have for anyone contemplating exploring the public BDSM scene.  The terminology and basic safety rules are \\"musts\\" at any responsible event.<br />Because this is book is written by a scene player, it does move a little quickly over the initial exploratory stages that many couples go through to get into SM -  Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns has a somewhat more elaborate introduction into the SM mindset.  However, if you have decided that you are going to play and want to know how, there isn't any better book out there to get started with.	2000-12-31

The third installment in the Marketplace series again picks up with Chris Parker, the outwardly disciplined and inwardly tortured trainer.  This time, he enters the services of a female Mistress in order to help train a would be dominant, Brian.  However, the immature and hasty Brian quickly conflicts with the older, more experienced Chris Parker and is forced to learn about mastering himself before being able to truly master others.<br />Like other books in this series, the book is well written and interesting.  It provides an interesting glimpse into the techniques of training and is one of the few decent BDSM books written from the tops perspective.  (For an interesting alternative, see Susan Matthew's Prisoner of Conscience)  Still, the Brian character is so intensely irritating and childish, it is difficult to identify the characters in this book, which I believe is absolutely critical in really enjoying this type of fiction.  A great series but I liked the first two books better.	2000-12-01

Each submissive has excelled in the mainstream BDSM scene and have been selected for their potential to join the ranks of those that do not play at D&amp;S but rather live it.  Put in the services of the enigmatic trainer, Chris Parker, the four slaves are pushed to their limits and molded into the epitome of true servitude.<br />For those readers that fell in love with the BDSM classic, the Story of O, there has finally come a series that treats BDSM as more than just a cheap trick to sell poorly written porn.  This book is well written, has identifiable characters and an interesting premise.  Lara Antinou is a frequent guest at many BDSM conferences.  I believe that her premise taps into the desire of many of BDSM scene (whether they go the events or just dream at home) that there is a group of people out there that take the leather scene a little more seriously than your average S&amp;M aficionado.  It is just a little exciting to think that if you can shine as a truly powerful Master or well behaved slave, that you may be allowed into a special clique of true devotees.<br />In addition to her well conceived premise, the characters in the book are well developed and interesting to read about.  And while you may or may not identify with the disciplined Chris Parker or the powerful Grendel, they sure would be a lot of fun to meet in the proper setting.<br />Just one note of caution, if you are not comfortable with bisexuality then you may not enjoy this book.  Otherwise I think that you find it is a welcome break from aggressive, badly written fare that passes for BDSM novels.	2000-11-30

He challenges a number of traditional assumptions regarding the dating and sequencing of monuments and artifacts in such cultures as the early Egyptian, Peruvian and Mexican periods.  And for daring to call into question some of the basic assumptions of archeology, he has been praised by some but widely vilified by many established members of the scientific community.  It is interesting to note the strong reactions just in the reviews in Amazon.<br />While I may not be qualified to establish whether Hancock's theories are a revolutionary rediscovery of our past or just an interesting alternative interpretation, I can tell you that this book makes very interesting reading.  It is not presented as a grand conspiracy theory, nor do I feel that Hancock is trying to justify a particular ideology.  Instead, Hancock takes the reader on an exploration of a number of historical oddities - interesting phrases from ancient Incan writings about fires in the sky, ancient maps that precisely detail hidden parts of Antarctica and other possible explanations for the Atlantis mythos.  He does not present any outrageous claims that earth was invaded by aliens or that Egyptians were an industrial civilization, however, he does present a fair amount of material for consideration by his readers to form their own opinions.  In many cases, he admits not have the answers just questions that can not be answered by established &quot;scientific facts&quot;.  As a serious scientist, Hancock does research his questions sufficiently to justify raising issues with established doctrine<br />Overall, this is a though provoking book that is highly entertaining to read whether you believe it to be true or just an interesting theory.	2000-11-30

Re/search has delivered a fantastic compendium of stories and photos of people that take the art of body modification to the extreme - piercing (everywhere and with anything), tattoo, scarification, extreme corsetry and surgical alterations (including genitalia splitting).  The interviews that accompany this fantastic array of photos are interesting, genuine attempts to understand why people would go to such extreme lengths to alter their bodies.<br />This is the kind of coffee table book that your guests will not be able to put down.	2000-11-29

It is the story of young noble woman who visits a strict Catholic nunnery where wanton women are punished harshly for indulging in sins of the flesh.  As she tours the dungeons, pits and workcrews where these unfortunately drudges are toiling away, she is regaled with the explicit tales of the women's indulgences and the horrifying punishments inflicted upon them in order to make them reform.<br />This novella has been around for sometime and remains popular.  I, however, can not explain why.  The illustrations are not particularly well done and the characters are somewhat unattractive.  The bondage and torture devices are fairly extreme but not particularly original or imaginative.  I guess one of the redeeming qualities of the book is the more extensive than usual dialog and story line for this type of book.  In terms of bondage illustrations and stories, I find Michael Manning more interesting, but if you want to see voluptuous (i.e. fat) women being humiliated and tortured then this book will interested you.	2000-11-29

I believe this very important for the readers of this book to know since there are many myths, preconceptions and outright non truths floating around about how non monogamous relationships work.  There are large numbers of people trying to make a quick buck by writing titillating stories about the adventuresome world of swinging.  &quot;Lady Green&quot; has been in a long term open relationship for years and can honestly let you know how to do it successfully.<br />One of the reviews stated that this book is geared to a lesbian audience; this is not correct.  At once point, one of the authors discusses her unsuccessful marriage to an overly conservative male, but she is railing against inhibited people more than bashing men in general.<br />If you are looking for a Penthouse letters version about the joys of multiple partners then this book is not for you.  However, if you and your partner are looking for a practical handbook to help you explore alternative lifestyles, then this book is the best one we have found.	2000-11-29

If you are into erotic graphic novels, Erich van Gotha is bound to be one of your favorites.  His illustrations are beautifully realistic and the action is harsh and hardcore.  Twenty is set in the near future, in a time when AIDS and disease has been conquered by medicine and the world is experiencing a new sexual revolution.  An impressionable young woman is sent, upon instructions from her guardians, to a special school where she is trained in the arts of giving and receiving pleasure.  Through diligent school work and many extra circular activities, Twenty learns to let go of her shame and inhibitions in order to live the life of a healthy, well adjusted libertine.<br />Unlike von Gotha's other works (Dreams of Cecilia, Troubles of Janice, Special Prison), there is less of a BDSM story line in Twenty.  Von Gotha delivers scene after scene of beautiful, young girls acting out wild fantasies with a host of attractive and willing playmates.	2000-11-29

It is a poorly written, uninteresting book that is blatantly trying to cash in some money by appearing as an erotic novel.  The story is about a bunch of female naval recruits that have been sent to an all male naval vessel against the captain's wishes.  In response, the captain allows his crew to take liberties with their new crewmates in order to &quot;teach them a woman's place&quot;.  And surprise of suprises, it turns out that the females really love this uninspiring humiliation.<br />A weak storyline, which is further crippled by poor writing, makes this book worthless.  The book is too short to develop any interesting characters, the situations that the characters are placed in are unimaginative and the descriptions of the actual sex is unexciting.<br />If you are looking for good D&amp;S writing, try Laura Rees or Laura Antinou instead.	2000-11-28

She flits from one sexual encounter to the next, ravishing the souls of her partners in the process.  Fortunately, her demonic possessor has some powerful enemies ready to help Girl out.  All in all, not the most original plot in the world but enough to keep the story going.<br />The illustration is rough and not particularly sophisticated.  However, it crude format matches the content fairly well.  The subject matter is extremely explicit and Taylor uses the power of illustration to show scenes that could never happen in real life.  Some people will not care for the scenes with the semi bestial demons, others will be interested in it's &quot;over the top&quot; nature.<br />If you are looking for novel about a sexually uninhibited woman, who is open to anything and always ready for more, you are going to love Girl.

Satan quickly conquers the convent - abusing, violating and killing a number of well endowed women in the process. Fortunately, one of his victims escapes to tell her tale and the Vatican sends a rescue mission of Knights Templar to drive out the devil.<br />The comic book is painted rather than drawn and better quality than many other books of this nature. The story line is basically a vehicle to move from depraved scene to depraved scene and is obviously translated from some other language.<br />The content is even more obscene than Kevin Taylor's Girl.

Basically, the book follows Jill from sexual encounter to sexual encounter.<br />The distinct Taylor illustration style has not changed in his new book other than the addition of colour - which is integrated successfully.  Some people will not like the thick lines and the physically impossible anatomies - if you are looking for realistic illustrations then von Gotha or Duvet are better bets.  However, the crude, exaggerated illustrations match the super hard core story line.<br />If you enjoy stories about beautiful girls that can't get enough satification and have inhuman sexual stamina, the Jill is your dream date.
