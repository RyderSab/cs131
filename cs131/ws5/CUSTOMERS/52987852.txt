It is amazing and creative and suspenseful and sooo exciting that I finished it in one day. D.J. Machale better get the seventh one out soon or I'll die, because he ended it in a cliffhanger like all the rest of the books. Please buy the whole series!	2005-06-20

No Time Like Show Time was just as suspenseful and cool as the other books and I hope the next book comes out soon! In case you're wondering what it's about, it is set in the world of mice, rats, and other like creatures with the main character a mouse watchmaker named Hermux Tantamoq, who has an otherwise quiet life until he meets Linka Perflinger in the first book, who becomes his new love interest and somehow gets him involved in all sorts of thrilling adventures throughout the first and second books. Besides a new mysterious plot with each book, there is also a little romance for the teen readers, but it is tastefully done and there is nothing, in my opinion, overly romantic. Anyway, it's a great book and series and I would really recommend that you consider buying it!	2005-05-22
US	52987852	R17EM5TA3RZGJN	0689861753	762887058	Bound	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Kept Me Spell-BOUND	This book is a great Chinese version of the Cinderella story, which you can tell Ms. Napoli did a lot of research for by the rich detail and description of Chinese life in that period. Also, it was not your typical Cinderella story in that Xing Xing (pronounced Shing Shing) got along pretty well with her half sister Wei Ping until the end, but I won't give away what happened then! Not to mention, this book was very engrossing and I found that it was extremely difficult to put down; I would even take it into restaurants with me! I had no trouble becoming attached to Xing Xing, the main character, and it was one of those rare books that brings tears to your eyes. Furthermore, the things that happened to Xing Xing because she was a girl were all realistic.(Excluding the whole fairy-tale thing.) The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because fantasy is more my type of thing and I wish it hadn't ended so abruptly! All in all if you need a break from really long books and want to read something suspenseful, interesting, and fairly short, then read this book! It's definitely worth it!	2005-03-10

I really had to force myself to read through it. What a letdown to a really great series. Absolutely NOTHING moved forward in this story. No movement in Flinx's mental powers, no movement in his relationship with Clarity (in fact she wasnt even in the book), no movement towards finding or using the weapon platform. You can skip this book and MISS NOTHING in this series. What a piece of CR*P.	2004-11-15
US	52987852	R3MSE9I3B51NYP	0439456959	163376703	Dragon Rider	Books	5	21	23	N	N	Really Cute	When I bought this book, I had already read Inheart and The Thief Lord and was hoping Ms. Funke wouldn't let me down. Well, she didn't! This book is very likeable and a fun fantasy read. Though, as previously mentioned by another reviewer, it isn't as serious as her other works, but more light-hearted. I really enjoyed it, and thought that the author did a good job of putting a clever spin on over-familiarized mystical beasts. Not to mention I was sad when it ended, and that's always a good sign! It's a little slow getting started, but is hardly a drawback at all. Recommended!	2004-09-12

This book is about Tianna, the newest Daughter of the Moon, who finally learns her true heritage and goes through a lot of pains to find out.	2004-09-12

I have never liked science-fiction, I'm typically a fantasy fan, but this book changed my mind. It's extremely well-written, original, and engrossing. This author is also good at making you feel what the characters feel. When Ender cried, I cried. When Valentine (his sister) felt guilty, I felt guilty. I wanted to strangle anyone who hurt Ender (the main character) because he quickly won my respect with his intelligence. If you ever read any book, read Ender's Game! PLEASE!	2004-09-12

That he was a brave soldier and therefore somehow more fit to be President. Actually he spent only 4 months in Vietnam, and having recieved several self inflicted \\"wounds\\" returned home early. This book points out the real story. It's a must read.
