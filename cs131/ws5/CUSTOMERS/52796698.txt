I really having nothing more to add to the more intelligent review here, except to say: Quit classifying this book as cyberpunk!! It is a historical treasure hunt, and it's nothing like Snow Crash or The Diamond Age. Many people have complained about the ending of Cryptonomicon. I didn't think it was that bad. The past and present storylines converged and the adventure was completed, albeit with some loose ends. You want a bad ending, read The Diamond Age...a brilliant work, hamstrung by the last chapter.<br />Now, while I really liked Cryptonomicon it is by no means perfect. It doesn't appeal to a mass audience (is this bad?) and only geeks, engineers, and frequent readers of slashdot.org who are WW II buffs will truly appreciate it. I could have been trimmed by a couple hundred pages and been just as effective. I have no plans (at this point) to read the Baroque Cycle (prequel).<br />Time for a bowl of Cap'N Crunch...	2004-06-09

Typically novelizations are exact replicas of the movies.  The &quot;author&quot; (ie. scribe) is tossed some version of the script and told to churn out a book in time to get to the printers before release of the movie.  The Day After Tomorrow is no different.  And didn't this guy write Communion and claim to have been abducted by aliens in the '70s or something?  (shrug)<br />Again...just go to the movie.

I just have to say...get a grip!  Ender's Game is a decent adolescent, soft sci-fi book that has somehow garnered legendary status within our public school system (my wife is a teacher).  Yes it's an (extremely) easy read, yes it's entertaining, but it is not a masterpiece that can be uttered in the same breath with such fictional works as Dune, The Lord of the Rings, Hamlet, etc.<br />A little perspective is required when reviewing something you really like.  Step back and evaluate it with an honest eye before elevating it into the pantheon of pulp fiction legend.	2004-01-12

To put it bluntly, this series need to be buried...with a final titanium nail being hammered into the coffin lid as a symbolic gesture to the rest of fantasy fans (and authors) that dreck like this should not be allowed to drone on, tolerated, or purchased.  This is book is a book for publishing's sake...not to tell a story.  This book is a shell of it's predecessors.  This series is a shell of it's former self.  And Terry Goodkind (the Kevin J. Anderson of fantasy...this is not a compliment!!) has become a slightly less relevant shell than the one he used to be.  I am utterly sick and tired of fantasy (and sci-fi) authors churning out endless series of books so they can continue to receive royalty checks.   Guess what?  I'm not buying your crap anymore.  I don't begrudge the fact that you need to make a living, but pull yourselves out of the intellectual gutter and write something new...quite milking the stale cash cow!!  I challenge fantasy and sci-fi authors to write a standalone book that is 300 pages long.<br />This book and this author is a symptomatic indicator of what the fantasy &amp; sci-fi literature scene has become...and I don't like it.	2004-01-05

We have a problem here my friends...a problem perpetuated by us, the fans.  We are continually fed endless series by nearly every popular author for the sake of the allmighty dollar.  The only person getting fulfilled by reading these bloated works are the author and the publisher.  We, the fans, are forced to wade through up to 10,000 pages for a story that could (conceivably) be accomplished in a tight 600 page novel.  Ask yourself:  When was the last time you read a standalone fantasy novel?<br />Yes I own the books, but Robert Jordan (and Tor) is one of the leading offenders in this area.  Make a stand and stop buying fantasy &amp; sci-fi series that end up turning into mindless drivel after a few books.  These people (and companies) are publishing books merely for the sake of publishing and making money...not to tell us a story.	2004-01-05

The books is a fascinating character play that's a little short on action.  Reynolds creates a character in Tanner Mirabel who is often lauded as a heavy handed, mercenary badass, but he rarely acts like one.  And there's a reason for that.  My real issue with the book is the pacing.  The first 600 pages are written in excruciating narrative detail, and the final 100 pages feels rushed.  I think there's a lot of spurious and weighty narrative that could have been cut early.  For example all the elements concerning Dream Fuel seemed a bit pointless.  Even the discovery of the grub, which was one of the more interesting concepts, seemed a bit wasted.  I thought these were going to go somewhere but they really didn't.  Despite all the asides Chasm City basically boils down to a revenge story.<br /><br />I had hoped that Chasm City presented more detail about how the Melding Plague came about, or how it got to Yellowstone...but none of that information is there.  Instead we simply see the aftermath.<br /><br />Chasm City is still a very good book full of complex character and intertwining plot lines.  I recommend it.	2003-12-31

Having won the Nebula award I was wary of it since most award winners never live up to the hype that is piled on to them.  But this book is one of those that wears the award in quiet satisfaction...never getting all the attention that others get (ie. the overly hyped Neuromancer that is far inferior to the much better, non-award winning, Snow Crash).  This is my first foray into Sawyer's works, and The Terminal Experiment comes across as an early techno-thriller penned by Michael Crichton when he still wrote interesting works.  It also reminds me of the movie Brainstorm in which thoughts can be recorded and they accidentally capture the image (thoughts) of someone entering the afterlife.  Sawyer presents some interesting arguments about immortality, life after death, and the human soul...all in relation to artificial life (intelligence).  The book moves along at a great pace, and the stuggles (professional and personal) of the main character are believable.  One thing I learned from the book is to never make a copy of your brain pattern when you're [upset].  ;-)	2002-10-03

This is yet another sci-fi book written in the 60s with a really interesting premise that gets too bogged down in the preachy social issues of the time.  Simak's prose isn't the most eloquent, but it suffices.  The story does meander a bit, and suffers from descriptive prose that really would have been better suited to fleshing out the main character (Enoch) who is ~135 years old, and fleshing out the story more.  More interaction with traveling aliens would have been better too help give the feeling that the galaxy is a vast and strange place.  I enjoyed the book for the most part, but felt it could have been much more...and more interesting.	2002-10-03

He returns to Earth finding himself an outcast by 15 centuries of time.  William and many of his fellow soldier end up settling on a frigid planet 80 (?) light years from Earth where they can live out their lives with people from the same century.<br />_Forever Free_ is the story that takes place several years after _The Forever War_.  William and his wife decide they don't like the manipulative Earthers and Taurans dabbling in their affairs.  They decide to hijack the orbiting stasis ship, head out for a 10 year, near light speed trip, to return to their planet 40,000 years later.  But something goes wrong and they're forced to return early to a galaxy not quite the same.<br />The book had about 2/3 of the way through.  I really liked _The Forever War_ and several of the same characters are back in this one.  But the remaining 1/3-1/4 of the books is like one big &quot;Huh?&quot;  I can't really speak to it without giving it away, but it seems like Haldeman had set up an intriguing story up to a point and then suddenly realize &quot;Holy cow!  Draft due at the publisher...tomorrow!!??  Time to stick a bent fork in this baby, and fast!&quot;  For the most part I still enjoyed the book, it was a quick read.  But if you aren't a fan of _The Forever War_ just skip this one.<br />BTW, _Forever Peace_ (often called a prequel to _The Forever War_) really has nothing to do with this series.	2002-09-06

After recently reading numerous classic sci-fi books penned in the 1960s I've come to the realization that many of the works of that era suffered from too much agenda and too little story.  _Camp Concentration_ had the correct formula to be a greatly entertaining book, but instead the story gets mired down in blatant social finger pointing and preaching.  I appreciate authors who can hide their agenda WITHIN the story without having their main character(s) railing out loud (unendingly) against the establishment.  I found it fairly entertaining, and the ending took me a bit by surprise...but other than that it's Disch's self indulgent pose, through the main character Sacchetti, that may turn off the average reader.  This really isn't even sci-fi...but who's keeping track?  ;-)	2002-09-03

This is Niven's and Pournelle's first collaberation, and it shows.  While the story itself is pretty interesting, the characterization is poor and flow of the book is rather rough.  I've read other works by Niven/Pournelle and they are MUCH better than this.  I couldn't really accept or care about any of the characters.  Niven uses his knowledge of science and Pournelle his creativity for alien cultures to combine a story that didn't seem to mesh for me.  The Motie culture is certainly very interesting, but it gets lost somewhere.  When I finished this one and discovered there was a sequel (_The Gripping Hand_) I couldn't bring myself to read it and moved on to other works.  Perhaps I'll revisit it someday, but _Mote_ was not enough to pique my interest in reading a sequel.	2002-08-23

Too many books, so little time...I finally picked up this collection of Bradbury classics and loved nearly every story.  These stories cover the gamut from time travel, to monsters, to the wonder of a child getting a new pair of sneakers for the summer.  I found that many of the stories had children of child like themes.  _The Sound of Summer Running_ definately hit home for me.  _The Long Rain_ reminded me of H.P. Lovecraft's story about man being stranded on Venus.  And _A Sound of Thunder_ is a classic story of the consequences of theoretical time travel...at the expense of a single butterfly.  This is NOT a novel, it is a collection of short stories.  Many of them fantastical...few based in science, since at the time little was known about Mars, or Venus, or space travel.  Definately Golden Age sci-fi here.	2002-08-23
US	52796698	R2MPROEG73XW4Z	0441005667	204362253	Forever Peace	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Starts fast, loses steam.	Another title down on my trek through all the Hugo & Nebula winners.  Some of the winners have puzzled me, like this one.  \\"Forever Peace,\\" while borrowing a partial title from Haldeman's classic \\"Forever War,\\" really has nothing to do with the previous work.  In this novel Haldeman blends a mix of hard sci-fi and morality into a mixture that seems to separate like oil and water and cannot remain homogeneous.  The first part of the book starts out fairly fast and has a hard sci-fi edge to it, while the second part stumbles and digresses into a lecture about the human psyche and anti-war themes.  The problem with this book is that these topics should be mixed throughout.  Instead it feels like Haldeman wrote the first part of the book, took a year off, then came back to it.<br />It's a generally enjoyable book about a world on the edge of destroying itself while at the same time on the edge of discovering its collective psyche through \\"jacking\\" between humans, and thus eliminating its tendency to destroy itself.  A decent read?  Yes.  Award winning?  No.  It would certainly work better if Haldeman had taken a blender to his mixture of ideas (or his editor) prior to publishing.	2002-02-04

I have the cassette version of this BBC masterpiece featuring Ian Holm as Frodo.  I've listened to it and uncountable number of times while working, driving, and doing stuff on my computer...and I have to say that this is the best piece of radio drama I've ever listened too.  Weighing in at 12 hours it covers nearly all the detail of the trilogy with great detail.  The acting, effects, and music are excellent, and everytime I listen to it I feel that I'm transported to Middle-earth.  With the first movie now out, I suspect that this work may now be ignored in favor of a more visual (and also excellent) presentation.  Don't make the mistake!!

I've never been much of a fan of cyberpunk after reading William Gibson's thoroughly prose and character challenged Neuromancer.  But Snow Crash gives me hope for the genre.  Hiro Protagonist (nice play on words) is an out of luck pizza delivery dude in a world of city states, 20th century cliches run amok, and a lawless space betweend city states ruled by the Mafia and other groups.  On the side he is a gatherer of information...information rules the world, and can be sold for a nice penny.  Hiro (and his motley crew of sidekicks he meets along the way) discover that a Texas billionaire is bent on causing infocalypse via a religious cult he has set up based on ancient Sumerian mythology.<br />I like nearly everything about this book.  The gadgets, the characters, the setting.  I loved the concept of the Metaverse and how avatars interacted within it.  I did not care for all the Sumerian background.  It was obvious that Stephenson knows a lot about it, and felt the need to stretch his wings and take us down that road.  But, speaking for myself, I had no interest in Sumerian legend.<br />I also noted that Stephenson changed voice halfway through the book.  The dialoge and prose in the first half is fresh, witty, belligerent, daring, on the edge stuff.  I mean, I read the first few pages of the book and was like:  Wow, I've never read SF prose quite like this!  The second half is hum-drum prose that thousands of other writers churn out.  This has to stem from the fact that he wrote it over a 4 year period, thus losing some of the consistency of the prose.<br />Overall I really liked Snow Crash, but couldn't really get into the Sumerian mythology aspects of it.	2001-09-06

Clarke's best known works (not counting 2001).  In it he paints a portrait of an Earth under the protective wing of the Overlords, but man has no explaination...nor do they really need one.  Only a handful of humans question the motives of the Overloads who have abolished everything from disease to poverty to war.  The book is broken into three sections:  arrival, the golden age, and the last generation.  Each part is populated with believable and vulnerable characters.  The only constant throughout the book is Karellen the Overlord who is the Supervisor of Earth.  It is his task to prepare mankind for the destiny that awaits them.<br />Clarke does a great job making us feel like we are insignificant in this universe, and that there are stranger and more fantastical things possibly awaiting us.  The concept of the ending (whick I won't give away), or the hook, of this book is quite interesting.  While not a 5 starrer in my book, this is a great read, and one of the classis that has truly earned it's label.  READ MORE CLASSICS!	2001-09-04

We can listen to Tim Burton go on and on about how his new version of the movie was a &quot;re-imagineering&quot; of the original, but the fact is that it still carries the title of this book...to which it will always be compared. If Burton didn't want comparisons to this book, he should have given his movie a different title, or given a disclaimer like &quot;Loosely based on Pierre Boulle's novel.&quot; But enough about Burton's brainless movie. The only comparisons that can be made is with the orginal move, to which it compares fairly well.<br />Boulle's PotA is a much more civil place. The main characters (who are parelleled in the movie minus some of the French names) get there by time travel, but not the &quot;time anomaly in space&quot; type argument, but by simple Einstienian time dialation due to travel near the speed of light. It takes them 350 years Earth time to get there (700 years round trip)...which equates to 2 years ship time. The planet is, of course, polulated by Apes, but they are not the savages portrayed in the movie. Instead they treat humans as we would treat deer, or cattle, or any other animal. Many of the scenes/situations from the original movie were taken from the book...but there are also exceptions. When they learn that the main character is intelligent, they are very gracious and open with him...setting him free, giving him a place to live, letting him study with them, etc. But for reasons I won't give away, they eventually want him off their planet.  The ending, while sort of a mixture of the Heston and Burton films, is still a surprise...but easily predicted.<br />Sometimes I thought the main character was extremely arrogant and that Boulle preached and lectured a little with his prose, but I still enjoyed reading the original. If you're a fan of either movie, give it a read.	2001-08-30

A movie tie-in book is created when someone throws the script at an author and says &quot;Turn that into a book so we can make some more cash.&quot; Absolutely nothing new is added, no background, nothing...and it is true here. If you want background on how the story came about, go read the original book on which this movie and the original movie is based: Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle which can be found right here on Amazon. It was written in the 50s (or 60s), and is COMPLETELY different than Tim Burton's movie or this tie-in novel.

Does this mean it's a bad book?  Nope...still enjoyable.  I've been a fan of Lawrence's works since his first Ethshar book and The Cyborg and the Sorcerer. Lawrence is a master of character driven (as opposed to plot driven) fantasy. Dragon Weather reads just like his Ethshar books: it is light, fast moving, and you want to turn the page to find out what happens next. Some may cringe at me calling it \\"light fantasy,\\" but that's what it is. There is nothing deep here except the development of the main character Arlian and all the situations he finds himself in (and gets out of). I have yet to find a book of his that has not entertained me. I look forward to the two concluding volumes (Dragon Society & Dragon Venom), as well has his new Ethshar books.	2001-08-27

In this 1940 A.E. van Vogt work, he paints a portrait of Earth approximately 1500 years in the future with great effectiveness.  Instead of delving into the technobable that weights down today's books, he jumps into character developement, descripions of prejudice, and heightened paranoia.  Why?  Because Earth is populate by normal humans...and slans.  Slans are humans that have telepathic ability, and no mind (except another slan's) is quiet to them.  Normal humans have been methodically hunting down and killing slans out of fear and paranoia.  The story revolves around Jommy Cross and his fight to survive childhood and fight against human oppression.<br />I thought the narrative was gripping and the explaination of the way a telepath thinks, quite ahead of its time.  The science is lacking, but let's face it...the story is 60 years old!  But the fundamental storytelling is there.  One complaint:  van Vogt seemed to lose his way at the end.  The further into the book...the more the ends started to become unraveled.  I got the feeling that the book just sort of ended, and I wanted more.<br />But, this is a solid SF Golden Age book that stands up well with time.  If you're into the classics, this is a must read.	2001-02-10

In this short novel Heinlein tells the story (in first person) of Lorenzo Smythe, a man of the stage, as he stumbles upon the role of a lifetime in a bar over drinks with a pilot.  Lorenzo quickly finds himself embroiled in caper too far to turn back from and eventually becomes involved in a political coverup that is way over his head.<br />For the most part I enjoyed Double Star.  It started out light and comical, but eventually lost those two elements the more we learn about the political situation...and the more Lorenzo sinks into his role playing a double.  Now that I look back there is very little science fiction involved in this book other than trips to Mars and the Moon.  Beyond that it is a novel that focuses on politics, acting, and the theatre.  There are many references to Shakespeare; elements of which are the main plot of this book (deception and disguise).  Not being a fan of politics in general, I thought the heavy political aspects eventually pulled the book down.  But that's just my view.  There are many people who enjoy this type of narrative.  I wish Heinlein would have maintained the light and fun tone throughout.  Regardless, it was an enjoyable read on my trek through the Hugo &amp; Nebula winners.	2001-01-15

In his book Man Plus, Frederick Pohl mixes the worlds of medicine, cybernetics, and political intrigue into a well thought out tale of a man's journey to Mars.  Roger Tarroway, who is a backup in the Man Plus project, suddenly finds himself next in line to be turned into something both wonderful and horrific:  a human that can live on the surface of Mars without the need of a suit.  But the changes he must go through transform him into something hideous and powerful.  Can Roger's mind withstand the changes that he has to go through on an accelerated course?  Can he trust his best friend?  Will it work?  Pohl sets this admist and Earth in peril of destroying itself, and many think that the Man Plus project and the colonization of Mars is the only way to save it from the brink of disaster...and there are other interested parties involved...watching.<br />Some may find it a little slow or dry in places because there is little action throughout.  Pohl's use of the first person &quot;we&quot; at times was a little strange to me in a book written entirely in the third person, but there is a reason for it.  While not as tight or emotionally gripping as Pohl's masterpiece Gateway, Man Plus is a well written and executed award winner and deserves to be on the shelf of most sci-fi readers.	2001-01-11

Delany, considered by many to be the most complex and original sci-fi author out there, shines in this book.  Nova is probably Delany's most mainstream work, meaning that he cranked the intellect and dialect dial down just a tad so us mortals can just enjoy a fun book for once.  And Nova delivers.  The story centers around a the haunted captain of the Roc (a ship) that is on a quest for the equivalent of his Holy Grail.  Along the way he recruits arguably the most interesting ensemble cast of supporting characters I've ever encountered.  The search takes the crew to many strange places and situations.  I'm amazed at how much Delany can pack into such a short novel, quite amazing and something that modern sci-fi authors seem unable to do unless they have 700+ pages to work with.<br />Delany offers many innovative ideas in Nova, probably the most important being the pre-cursor to the cyberpunk movement.  Man-machine interfaces abound in Delany's books, a decade or more before William Gibson ever wrote or thought of Neuromancer.  It's a shame this book is out of print, but you can easily find it at any used book store.  Do yourself a favor and pick up some of the classics of bygone days...this being one of them in my opinion.	2001-01-11

Gateway by Frederik Pohl is a simple story about a complex man that takes place in a setting that lends itself to a myriad of adventures both enriching and terrifying...usually the latter.  In the case of down and out Robinette Broadhead it leads him to roll the dice on living the life of a \\"prospector\\" in space, and leads him to a mission that results in a life of opulent wealth, as well as soul wrenching guilt.<br /><br />The book begins with Robinette (Bob) undergoing psychoanalysis under the care of an artificial intelligence that he not so fondly refers to as \\"Sigfrid von Shrink.\\" Bob is wealthy, and happy...or so he keeps telling himself, but Sigfrid doesn't believe him.  Deep down in his soul Bob doesn't believe himself.<br />Bob begins reliving his story and the circumstances that led to sitting on a mat in a skyscraper talking to an AI about his problems.  As a young man Bob worked as a shale miner in Wyoming, the same occupation his mother and father held.  It's a dismal existence, but the only one they know.  He lives much of his life underground in dirty, miserable conditions with little hope of a different future.  His father died in a mine accident when he was very young.  He then developed a psychological problem and was put away for a year.  During this time his mother also died.  He returned to work in the shale mines, with an even more bleak future staring back at him in the hot, deadly tunnels.<br /><br />Then Bob won a lottery.  $250,000.  Not a lot, but enough to live well for a short time, or enough to buy a one way ticket to Gateway to become what he'd always dreamed of being...a \\"prospector.\\"<br /><br />Gateway is an enigma to humanity.  It's a hallowed out asteroid that holds approximately 1000 small ships left behind by a race called the Heechee.  No one knows why they left, where they went, or why they left behind all the ships.  (Note:  The Heechee are explained in a later sequel, but there's no requirement to read later novels to fully enjoy this one!)  The Gateway Corporation was established, and it was soon discovered that all of the ships were pre-programmed to destinations somewhere in the galaxy...but one didn't know the destination until one locked themselves in a ship and hit the launch button.  The ships used an autopilot system to navigate, would debark to a destination and (sometimes) return to Gateway. Trips took weeks or months...sometimes years (resulting in starvation obviously) depending on the ship taken.  Whatever was discovered on the other end entitled the pilot(s) to a cut from the Gateway Corporation. The people who rolled the dice on Gateway are called \\"prospectors.\\"  Prospectors either died or never returned or became wealthy from their exploration of the galaxy.  Death was the predominant result.  Future uncertain indeed.<br /><br />Would any of us make the choice to strap ourselves in to an alien ship not knowing where it would take us, or how long we would be gone?  How do you physically prepare for that other than stockpiling as many supplies in to the small ship as could possibly fit?  How do you mentally prepare for such a journey other than to assume you are going to die?  This was usually the mindset Bob had, and the theme that a person can become lost and desperate enough to even contemplate making that decision runs throughout the book.  But when the ship arrives at its destination and crews realize that they have enough food/oxygen to return home...the exuberance and welling of life coming from the characters is almost palpable.<br /><br />This is the path Bob Broadhead chose, because he felt it was better than the one he left.  Gateway is also a place where Bob seemingly beat the odds to survive and become incredibly wealthy.  We know the endgame on the the first page of the book.  But we don't know the journey to that endgame until we read the last page.<br /><br />Gateway alternates chapters between Bob being psychoanalyzed and flashbacks to Gateway.  The plot threads meet up at the and and we learn what  happened to Bob and why he's paying for a shrink.  The novel is sprinkled throughout with multi-genre elements such as lines of code from Sigfrid, classified ads on Gateway, mission reports, contract summaries, and the like.  These add an exceptional flavor and background to the story without unnecessary and bloated narrative.<br />The tale that Pohl weaves is mysterious, adventurous, and tragic.  The very ending itself (if one has rudimentary understanding of astrophysics) is chilling and depressing.  Towards the end of Gateway the reader can begin to understand why Bob is undergoing psychoanalysis and is so angry.<br />I've always believed that Gateway would make an amazing movie given the right script treatment.  But as far as I know it has not been optioned by any studio.  This is a shame.  It possesses all the elements that would make for a mind blowing science fiction drama.  But alas, Hollywood is too busy recycling and rebooting to see potential.<br /><br />Gateway is Frederik Pohl's greatest work, and stands as one of the best science fiction novels I've read over the years.  The book isn't the length of modern science fiction novels (my version weighs in at 313 pages), and it seems to be forgotten by many, and unknown by even more.  Gateway won numerous awards when it was published:  Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and John W. Campbell awards for best science fiction novel.  To my knowledge no other book has won all four of these awards...it's also one of a few that actually deserves them.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-01-08

The only other Lieber works I've read have been the very likable Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser series...a fantasy staple.  The Big Time is definately an original piece of time travel fiction, yet there is actually no time travel involved in the book.  The prose is light on narrative and very heavy on dialogue.  I had little to work with in visualizing the surroundings (basically a large room) in which the characters interacted the entire time.  Despite this, I did enjoy it for the most part; although once again I am left a little baffled by the ending (a la Babel-17 by Delany).  As someone else pointed out (who I agree with) this book reads like a stage play, and could easily be turned into a strange, yet tense, psuedo-time travel suspense.  It's a quick read.  If you want to hit all the &quot;classics&quot; and can find a copy, go for it.  If you're a casual sci-fi reader, I recommend you skip it.	2001-01-05
US	52796698	RX2R4S1S2LCJ7	1857988051	621237166	Babel-17	Books	3	8	14	N	N	Original but minimalistic	Who better to write a sci-fi novel about alien linguistics but Samuel R. Delany.  Everytime I read one of his books I am both irritated and awed at the same time.  Irritated in that his prose is so minimalistic that it robs you of the story; in awe because he does manage to describe a lot with very few words.  Babel-17 has many new and original idea (cyberpunk modifying of your bodie, discorporate souls for ship navigation, etc), but it a lot of it gets lost in the eloquent prose.  I wish he would have taken a little more time and wrote a little more to flesh out the small world he created in Babel-17.  This is definately not Delany's best work.  If you want a great space romp that's very similar in style and setting as Babel-17, read Nova.	2001-01-03

There are sooo many other better written young adult novels out there that it's not even funny!  J.K.  Rowling should be writing some royalty checks to the media, because they  are selling her books for her.  I think it's great that it's getting kids  reading, but try reading something else.  This is getting as bad as  Pokemon, and that is NOT a good thing.  Mediocre writing, mediocre stories.	2000-07-25

From the elf to the &quot;grendel&quot;.  I found myself not caring one bit for any of the characters.  The dialogue is contrived and the concept just sets you up for a boring read.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book and, God forbid, the 12 book series.  An elf in the NYC subways?  Yawn.	1998-02-25
