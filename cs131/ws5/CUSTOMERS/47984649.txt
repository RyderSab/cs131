Big Bang theory is, in fact, a non-sequitur.     If 1) in the beginning there \\"was\\" nothing, and if 2) \\"it\\" exploded, then, 3) nothing exploded!    If we would take this seriously we would have to conclude that nothing exists! Such a nonsense! The idea that the universe was created by a random explosion tells us more about the kind of society we live in, than about the Universe itself. Explosions create chaos and noise, not order and information.     This interesting book comes to show that far from having the qualities and characteristics that one would obviously expect from a casual, accidental and random process, the universe seems to have been fine-tuned for life, and not only for life but also for intelligent and inquiring life.    Although the holes in the Big Bang theory have been increasing in the recent decades, undermining its status as a ruling paradigm, it is interesting to see that the results we get from macro-observations mimics the results we get from micro-observations. Also life has the highly specified complexity we normally and instinctively associate with information and intelligence.        That's why many astrophysicists and biologists, even atheists, speak of the \\"antropic principle\\", of \\"antropic coincidences\\", \\"designoids\\"  \\"appearance of design\\", etc. They use words like \\"code\\", \\"words\\", \\"translation\\", \\"transcription\\", etc., because the vocabulary of randomness and accident is manifestly insufficient to describe what they see in nature.     In spite of all this, many try hard to show that that although appearance of design and fine-tuning is overwhelming, it is all the result of a big explosion of primordial nothingness. The problem with this understanding, is that it simply doesn't fit the observable evidence. Empirical data doesn't speak about randomness. Pretending it does is like running against the wind.     If science is about what can be observed, than it is about information and design, because both can be empirically detected andmeasured. That's why creationism (in its various shapes and sizes) is here to stay. It simply is more scientific than a pure naturalistic and materialistic definition of \\"science\\".     Of course all this has religious and philosophical implications, but so does any approach to science. All science necessarily relies on assumptions about the totality of what is. There are many conceptions of science, all with their own overt or covert assumptions.     The authors try to find a third way between naturalism and biblical creationism, although I think that we have no choice but to embrace biblical creationism if we can get a consistent interpretation of all empirical, theological, moral and social data available.     Naturalism and biblical creationism, both very different from the position adopted by the authors of this book, rely on different conceptions of science.     Naturalism will never have absolute certainty of the truth, in spite of all the accumulated data, because data never ceases to accumulate. Naturalism is based on human observation and extrapolation, but observations are limited and many different models can be built on the same observations. We will never be able to know for sure that we have embraced the true model. Besides, naturalism will always have problems with evidence of design in nature and lack of transitional evidence of evolution.     Biblical creationism, on the other hand, will always have confidence in absolute Truth, in spite of occasional difficulties with data. It is ultimately based in Revelation given by the One who IS and observes all there is to observe. Biblical Creationism is based on the Words of the One who is the Alpha and Omega. It confidently asserts and predicts that all empirical evidence will ultimately fit the pre-given account of reality, given in the Bible, like the pieces of a big puzzle that will fit to a pre-given picture. This will ultimately be testable. Biblical creationism will be perfectly comfortable with evidence of design and with lack of transitional evidence of evolution.     Naturalism and creationism rely on different assumptions and epistemologies, but their accuracy can be measured against the real world. One thing we can say for sure: as far as we know, there is no such thing as a religiously neutral concept of science.	2005-10-03
US	47984649	R164Z07EU9703F	0674016874	55275137	The Evolution-Creation Struggle	Books	3	21	90	N	N	Origins science is not religiously neutral	Michael Ruse is one of those naive darwinists who attempt to promote a worldview in which Christianity can be reconciled with science, if and only if science has the last word. Actually he has a naturalistic stake in this evolution-creation struggle.  <br /> <br />He wants to keep science pure from any \\"religious miracles\\" but doesn't bother to maintain the ultimate \\"naturalistic miracle\\": the universe, with its astonishing macro and micro complexity, has no ultimate cause!!! Galaxies, stars, \\"quasars\\", \\"blasars\\", planets, the solar system, aminoacids, proteins, molecular machines, DNA-RNA, cells, thousands of different perfectly functional organisms, all evolved out of nothing, by purely random processes, against all mathematical and probabilitistic odds!! That's remarkable, for someone who says he doesn't believe in miracles. For Michael Ruse - who has been around and seen enough - this naturalistic miracle can stay, even against all evidence, because it doesn't bring God in to the picture. Apparently, he doesn't dare to question evidence of design in nature, but it is clear he doesn't want to face off with the Designer.  <br /> <br />According to this view, Christian faith can only hold on as long as it stands the test of modern science. For Michael Ruse, evolutionism is an unquestioned paradigm, that should be used to evaluate all religious doctrines. For Michael Ruse, science and religion remain separated, and evolutionists, such as Richard Dawkins, should not cross the border line that keeps them separated. Religion and biblical creationism are, a priori, considered as epistemologically inferior, according to the rules of the game establioshed by naturalists, because they are not based on the observations and rational theorizations of men.  <br /> <br />As plausible as this may seem to those who have been mercilessly indoctrinated by modern rationalism, this view is in reality totally flawed.  <br /> <br />The point is that Biblical Creationism is perfectly scientific, because is based in the observations and rational activities of a perfectly moral and rational God, the Creator. The fact that we consider ourselves rational and expect rationality from this world comes from this foundational understanding. We cannot base our expectations of order, intelligibility, mathematical beauty of relativity equations, and golden proportions on random and purely accidental processes and assumptions.  <br /> <br />It is true that, from the point of view of modern human science, it seems totally absurd to start a scientific inquiry by relying on a Sacred Book. I know what naturalism is all about and do understand these feelings. After all, the argument goes, science should rely only on observation, hipothesis building, experimental testing, conclusion formulating, theory building and paradigm constructing. So why rely a priori on a Sacred text?  <br /> <br />My answer to this would be:  <br /> <br />A) Every observation is based on a priori assumptions. These may be either a belief in a Creator or a belief that nature is all there is. Evolutionists cannot do without a priori assumptions.  <br /> <br />B) The origin of the Universe is not observable. No one was there to watch. If there is a God, then He is the only reliable witness to the process of Creation. You can only start with some form of Revelation or with your own speculations and extrapolations. In this light, the Bible is a good starting point, because of its inherent plausibility from a scientific, historical, anthropological moral and spiritual perspectives, all of which have been tested in many different contexts and times.  <br /> <br />C) Observations are incomplete. Many astronomers are now saying that we may never understand the origins, since the speed of light and microwave background radiation may have been influenced by many astronomical events that we may never be able to observe and understand. Others, think they can put forward a theory of everything by sayingthat out Universe is one in millions of previous or parallel universes, as if it wasn't hard enough just to explain our Universe.  <br /> <br />D) The same observations are able to generate hundreds of different theories. So we may ask: how will we ever now if we have come up with the right explanation? If we don't know the truth in advance, if our observations are conditioned by a priori assumptions, limited and able to generate multiple theories and models, how will we be able to recognize the true explanation when we see it?  <br /> <br />For these reasons, it seems to me that it makes complete sense to start with the Bible, with its model of special creation a few thousand years ago, fall and curse, global flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation. I know this may be a humbling experience to modern proud rationalism and naturalism. But then, so what? True wisdom and knowledge about the origins of a created world starts inevitably with the revelation of the Creator. It is absolutely reserved for the Creator to establish the epistemological rules of the origins game. If we don't accept these rules, we lose.  <br /> <br />Although this epistemological humbling experience may prima facie sound utterly unscientific and repugnant to the modern mind, it makes perfect sense because it tells what we should look for and expect to find, as any other scientific model would. In this sense, the Bible is scientific because it helps us to make many predictions. Remember that even Stephen Jay Gould had to admit that biblical creationism does indeed make predictions.  <br /> <br />For instance, the Bible predicts states of affairs such as:  <br /> <br />1) all species of the flora and fauna belong to separate genera, so we should not expect to find intermediate links in the fossil record, in molecular biology and in the living world.  <br /> <br />2) since all species were created by the same Creator, they are expected to show relevant genetic, structural and functional similarities and be dependent on each other.  <br /> <br />3) since Man was created in the image of God, we should expect the fine-tuning of the Universe for life, with many \\"antropic coincidences\\".  <br /> <br />4) since all creatures were created by an Omnipotent and Omniscient God, we should expect overwhelming signs of complex specified information and intelligent design in the macro and in the micro universe.  <br /> <br />5) since all species were created by a Omniscient and Omnipotent God, we should expect systems and mechanisms of adaptation to the environment and minor variations within species.  <br /> <br />6) since God is the creator of life, the probability of a single cell emerging by chance should be virtually zero, and we should not expect life to be generated by non-life by random processes.  <br /> <br />7)since God made the species (a term that does not correspond to the biological concept of species) with special designs, we should dismiss the existence of vestigial organs and junk-DNA.  <br /> <br />8) since God has cursed His creation because of Man's sin, we should expect that along with evidence of design the universe reveals evidence of that curse (v.g. death; carnivory; harmful mutations; accumulation of genetic diseases; death of the unfit; attack and defence systems; poisons; pathogenics).  <br /> <br />9) since there was a global flood several thousand years ago, we should expect to find lots of liquid water in the Planet along with many signs of fossilization and cathastrophism in geology. We should also expect to find many more living fossils than intermediate fossils.  <br /> <br />10) since there was a global flood, we should expect some of its most probable results, including the petrified forests, canions, sediments, fossils, the Ice Age and the continental drift. We also should expect earthquakes, storms, and tsunamis.  <br /> <br />11) since the Earth is young, we should expect that its magnetic field is also still young.  <br /> <br/>12) since the Sun is young we should expect its nucleus to be young.  <br /> <br />13) since the Universe is young we should expect to find mature galaxies even where scientists say they should not exist.  <br /> <br />14) since Man didn't evolve, men will always be men (v.g. Neandertals) and apes will always be apes (v.g. Australopithecus).  <br /> <br />15)since Dinosaurs were living until several millenia ago, we should expect to find many accounts of the interaction between men and \\"dragons\\", and should expect to find soft tissue, ligaments, cells and hemoglobin inside some of their petrified bones.  <br /> <br />16) If a God of Love and Justice has created Man in His image, and if Man has sinned and ruined His creation, than we should be able to look into History and find a special revelation or a dramatic event in which God provides some kind solution to man's problem. Maybe Christmas and Easter can provide some indication.  <br /> <br />The scandal for evolutionists, is that all these and other biblical predictions, although not scientific according to modern scientific standards, have been shown to be true.  <br /> <br />The result is that the scientific community finds itself many times in a state of shock and awe, or of surprise and wonder, when its own predictions are denied time and time again and when creationists predictions are found to be in full accord with observable evidence. The problem, then, lies in the modern scientific paradigm, as well as in the modern dichotomy of science and religion.  <br /> <br />I know that this may be hard to admit for many evolutionists, such as Michael Ruse, that have been indoctrinated by modern rationalists and simply cannot do better than that. Their naturalistic, uniformitarian and evolutionary \\"memes\\", with all their appearance of intellectual sophistication, simply don't allow them to move beyond that.  <br /> <br />The current scientific paradigm may be very appropriate when dealing with observable facts (and there is no conflict between creationists and evolutionists when it comes to observed facts), but it fails miserably when it comes to engaging in origins science. Here we simply cannot do without the Creator and His revelation. Since He is the Alpha and Omega, only He can give meaning to our present existence and provide a reliable account of what happened in the past and of what will happen in the future.  <br /> <br />That's why I find Michael Ruse's position incredibly puerile and naive. If he wants to keep the modern scientific method at the expense of truth, then let him have it. It is his problem. I would prefer to be called a child of God, than a child of modernity. By the way, God is not pre-modern or post-modern either.  <br /> <br />If evolutionists stick to their failed paradigm, against all empirical reasons, they will find themselves, time and again, in a state of shock and awe, surprise and wonder, because evolution simply didn't happen and will never fit the observable data. Evolutionists try to assure us that everything is random and purposeless, and than ask us to take seriously their own thoughts.  <br /> <br />Michael Ruse should study American Constitutional Law and realize that the original meaning of separation of Church and State, in First Amendment to the federal Constitution of 1787, has nothing to do with preventing a scientific recognition of the Creator, based on sound facts and arguments.  <br /> <br />In the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, even fundamental rights are the product of intelligent design, since their fundamental character rests on their being endowed by the Creator. Michael Ruse's \\"constitutional Law\\" arguments could have worked in Jacobin France or communist Soviet Union or Albania, but they should not be allowed to work in America, nor in any decent country.  <br /> <br />Separation of Church and State wants to prevent authoritarian enforcement of religion, \\"science\\" or ideology, but not to prevent the free and open discussion thereof. Michael Ruse naturalistic stakes in this debate distort his vision of religion, science, philosophy and even constitutional law.  <br />	2005-08-31

He is the \\"ultimate scientoid\\", since he mistakes design for \\"designoids\\"  <br /> <br />Challenging even the main tenets of postmodern epistemology, of men such has Nietzsche, Derrida, Foucault or Lyotard (who say that the thinking self is a metaphysical construct and even natural sciences are nothing more than power/knowledge functions mediated through texts, inter-texts and interpretations of texts) Dawkins pretends to be the bermensch of evolutionary imagination, with privileged access to ultimate or noumenal reality.  <br /> <br />After trying to explain (away) the complex problems relating the proof of abiogenesis, the finding of a common ancestor, the missing intermediate forms in the fossil record, irreducible complex molecular machines, Richard Dawkins admits that research must go on, and that he himself is (still) expecting exciting results.  <br /> <br />My advice to Richard Dawkins is: don't hold your breath while you wait for those results.  <br /> <br />In fact, recent results concerning radioisotopes and the age of the earth, the study of molecular machines, information theory, design theory, probabilities, population statistics and the age of the common ancestor, mitocondrial DNA, Y chromossome, vestigial organs, junk DNA, mutations, the speed of light, the structure of galaxies, redshifts, the chemmical composition of planets like Uranus and Neptunus, catastrophism in geology, all point to the plausibility of biblical creationism and its creation, curse, flood, dispersion and rapid speciation model.  <br /> <br />By the way, Richard Dawkins never misses an oportunity to trash creationists in this book. In fact, that's the whole point of this and other Richard Dawkins' books. But before insisting in making fun of creationists for believing that man and dinosaurs lived together, as he does in this book, he should consider the recent find of dinosaur soft tissue in a T-Rex bone, as well as the recent evolutionary fiascos of the Homo Floriensis and of the mon(k)ey making dating games of Rainer Protsch von Zieten.  <br /> <br />This just goes to show that creationists should have more chances to get their perspective across, for protecting the methodological and moral integrity of science. If creationists are challenged in the academia, they should be able to respond in the academia, and challenge naturalistic \\"science\\" on its assumptions. Other wise, naturalistic \\"science\\" becomes dogma.  <br /> <br />In fact, one of the reasons why creationists are criticized by Richard Dawkins, and most of his evolutionist acolites, has to do with the fact that they are challenging, with empirical basis, the interpretations on which evolutionists rely to understand some facts, as well as disputing some factual claims altogether.  <br /> <br />But there is more to it. After all, why would Richard Dawkins, a militant atheist, bother to criticize creationists, whom he despises, if not because creationists are messing with his own agenda?  <br /> <br />If Richard Dawkins was really consistent with his own beliefs, he would not care that much about creationists, since he would concede that his own theories (as well as those of creationists) might be an ilusion imposed on us all by our \\"selfish genes\\" exclusively for reproductive purposes.  <br /> <br />The fact is that the basic questions of evolutioniary theory remain unanswered. Evolutionists of the world, unite!! Research must go on!! Richard Dawkins is still expecting exciting results (and life is short)!!  <br />	2005-08-31
US	47984649	R10NVZ8ZX2X2ZI	0890511586	643985305	The Lie: Evolution	Books	5	14	36	N	Y	That's what it is	I really enjoyed this book. The purpose of the book was not so much to provide empirical data about the weakness of evolutionary hypothesis (which is done in other creationist books), but to work more on the domain of assumptions and presupositions. And this is a crucial task.     This has important implications not only in science, but also in theology and morality. The book has a message to everyone, but it specially addresses those christian leaders that for one reason or another have decided to compromise with evolution, mostly for not undestanding that it is simply a lie.     The punch line of this book is: if you start with wrong assumptions you will end up with a flawed model to research and interpret the world, and you will end up with wrong conclusions.    The botton line is: you have to start reasoning from God's Word, relying on its full authority in all spheres of life.     All knowledge (scientific, theological and moral) has to start from the Bible.     I admit this may be hard to swollow, not only for secular scientists, but also for confessional theologians, and even many prominent Church Leaders, be it Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and Evangelical. Even the Pope, in Rome, will have to face the truth of God's Authority and the authority of God's Truth. If not, he will be preaching another Gospel (which, unfortunately, is what many have been doing).     It may be hard to swallow for all of us, but that's what it is. It is not Ken Ham's choice, or AiG's choice. It is God's choice.  His Word endures forever, and so must our faith in it.	2005-07-29

It presents a consistent and comprehensive account of the real differences between \\"different races\\" in a way that takes the Genesis account of creation, fall, global flood, Babel and dispersion seriously.     Modern genetics is also taken seriously. Its teachings reinforce the Biblical model, which may come of a surprise only to those who have not been paying attention to the latest genetics and biblical creationist writings.     This account makes much more sense of  the linguistic, cultural and \\"melanine\\" differences between different peoples. As the authors say, the Bible never speaks of races. On the contrary, it presents all humans as the descendents of the common ancestors Adam and Eve, and of Noah and his three sons.     The punch line of the book is plain: we are all relatives, and the Gospel of Christ, the Creator, is for all of us, as descendents of the first Adam. The Bible accounts for the origin of the \\"human family\\" the Universal Declaration of Human Rights speaks of.     The stories of Hitler and the Jews, of the hunted aborigines and of Ota Benga, the Congo pigmy taken to a New York zoo to share a cage with monkeys, speak eloquently of the dangers of forgetting these important Biblical truths. But even the Christian Churches have many times incurred in serious wrong doing because of their own distorted interpretations (\\"eixegesis\\") of the Biblical text, starting with Genesis 1-11.     The problem of humans is not that they are animals, but they are sinners living in a fallen creation. This is a problem that only the Creator himself can fix. And he has done that.     The present book attempts to deconstruct some of the classical misinterpretations that have been used to justify \\"Christian racism\\". The solution for this problem not to  abandon the clear and present meaning of the text, followed by an attempt to compromise it to modern or post-modern human \\"wisdom, but a return to a careful literal interpretation of the Bible, as Jesus has taught us to do.	2005-07-17
US	47984649	R3GA2C8A2DAB0H	0313321221	190430452	Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction	Books	3	14	175	N	N	Avoiding the real problem and its implications	Although Eugenie Scott should be praised for a fair and balanced view of the current debate between evolution and creationism of one cannot overlook the fact that she has been a staunch defender of evolution as opposed to creation.     Of course, like many other evolutionists, she has never been able put forward a convincing argument in favor of evolution, since there is no such thing. But she has gone as far as repeating that evolution and God can coexist. Very impressive, indeed.     This is truly a very odd argument, comming from Eugenie Scott, since it only goes to show that the real problem in the debate between creation and evolution is not necessarily a religious one, since one may believe in God and evolution at the same time. In fact, the real problem is a purely scientific one: the fact is that there is not really any evidence of evolution.     No one has seen the prebiotic soup or life emerging by chance through organic evolution. No one has really seen a dinossaur evolving to become a bird 100 million years ago. No one has really seen inequivocal evidence of evolution in the fossil record, in molecular biology of in present fauna and flora. No one has really seen a mutation or any other evolutionary process increasing the genetic information in the genome.     Similarities and homologies cannot be presented as evidence of common descent and evolution, because they can be explained as well, and even better, by common Creator arguments. There is not any direct evidence for evolution. No genetic mutation known to scientists is able to create new genetic information. That's why creationists acknowledge the existence of random mutations, natural selection, speciation, variation and development of resistance to antibiotics, but insist that these processes have nothing to do with evolution, since none of them creates anything really new.      As can be seen, the main problem between creation and evolution is not a religious one, since they both are compatible with belief in God. Both the former and the present Pope believe in God and in evolution. The real problem we have to face is really the total lack of any convicing evidence of evolution, so evolution should not really be taught in schools.     So the book is not so much about the the conflict between evolution and creationism, but between creation and evolutionism. Eugenie Scott misses the whole point.     Evolutionism rests upon naturalist, evolutionary and uniformitarian interpretations of evidence, and not upon the facts themselves. These fit much beter and naturally, without any secondary assumptions, within the model and set of predictions of biblical creationism.     Of course, belief in creation has tremendous implications for theology, since it would shed a new light in the origin of specified complexity, the fine-tuning of the universe, the origin of the sexes, the origin of languagem, the recent origin of civilization, the historical and geological evidence of a global flood, the character of God, the origin of evil, the promise of salvation, restoration and recreation, and so on.     When we read Eugenie Scott we get the feeling that she is really trying to avoid the real problem, because she does not want to come to terms with its unavoidable implications.	2005-04-27
US	47984649	R37BESZ6NZKO6Z	0802841066	508560981	In the Beginning…': A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall (Ressourcement: Retrieval and Renewal in Catholic Thought (RRRCT))	Books	2	33	227	N	N	A theology with feet of clay	This book only goes to show that Joseph Ratzinger's theology, in spite of its alleged dogmatism and conservatism, has really feet of clay. Ratzinger builds his view of Genesis in modern epistemological dualism that separates the spheres of religion and science. For Ratzinger, as well as for strange bed fellows such as men like Hans Kung, Richard Dawkins, and Sephen Jay Gould, science puts forward the objective account about origins, and religion simply helps to put things in to a moral and theological perspective.<br /><br />For Razinger, science tells us what has happened in the begining, and theology states why it has happened. This naive view of things, although apparently obvious and modern, is totally flawed, and puts Ratzinger in the side of wrong theology and wrong science. If the Bible didn't want to say how God created the Universe and Men, it would simply say: In the begining God created the heavens and Earth\\", and leave the rest to science. This view, promoted with the unwise support of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, constituted by people that never really studied the Bible and have assimilated modern metaphysical and methodological naturalism, is totally nonsense, from a theological and scientific perspective.<br /><br />Theologically, Ratzinger is not able to explain why an all powerful, wise and loving God would take billions of years, through a trial and error process, to generate a world full of death, disease, genetic mistakes, catastrophic natural disasters, suffering and predatory cruelty. If God is able to create a perfect world, why didn't he do it immediately? Is He supposed to learn with His mistakes? If God created all that we see during millions of years and proclaimed that that is good, then, what is evil? Why should we trust Him when He says that Heaven will be good? What will that really mean? What is sin after all? Why does the Bible say that the wages of sin is death? Why does the Apostle Paul call death the \\"last enemy\\"? Why did Jesus have do die and rise from the death in order to physically conquer death, if death is not the penalty for our sins? Raztinger here goes not just against the Bible, but also against traditional catholic thinking.<br /><br />Scientifically, Ratzinger misses the point that there is not a single proof of evolution, once you go beyond naturalistic, evolutionary, and uniformitarian speculations and strapolation: 1) the origin of life is still a mystery; 2) the intermediate forms in evolution are still missing in the fossil record, in molecular biology and in current fauna and flora; 3) the common ancestor (\\"comcestor\\", as Dawkins would say) is still to be identified; 4) the origin of sexes is still a mystery; 5) evidence of intelligent design is overwhelming; 6) evidence of a young Earth and recent civilizations is overwhelming; 7)evidence of a catastrophic global flood, with enormous deposition of sediments and rapid fossil formation around the globe is overwhelming; 8) the origin of the Universe, galaxies, stars, planets, solar system, sun, moon, earth, is still to be explained.<br /><br />That's why men like Ratzinger (now Benedict XVI) and Kung, along with atheists Dawkins and (late) Jay Gould, in spite of all their differences, have something in common:  their worldviews can get pretty stubborn and dogmatic, but they all start from the downgrading of the Authority of God's Word. They all build on the authority of men, be it theological or scientific.<br /><br />Joseph Ratzinger is the champion of tradition, hierarchy and patriarchal imperialism. Kung is the champion of a thin, inclusivist, relativist, post-modern perspective of Christianity, in which there is no place for the sacrificial attonement of Jesus that is the basis of Christianity. For Kung, Jesus died mostly for his convictions, and not so much for our sins. Dawkins and Gould are the champions of naturalistic evolutionism, both gradualist and saltationist, (with thousands of \\"worshippers\\" around the world) in spite of the fact that they were never able to cite a single example of a mutation or any other evolutionary process able to increase the genetic information of the genome.<br /><br />The Bible tells us that God created a perfect creation, but that sin brought death, destruction and suffering to the world. God cursed his creation, delivered a global flood, and promised to restore heavens and earth, without death and suffering. That's why Jesus Christ died for our sins, so that by punishing his inocent Son, God didn't have to punish those of us who accept Him as saviour and could give us eternal life with Him.<br /><br />In the Bible, theology is always based in objective reality, and not in ingenious fables of myths, as the Apostle Peter would put it.<br /><br />Joseph Raztinger's flawed point is: the Bible should not be taken seriously when it speaks about science and history, but it should be taken seriously whenever the Church puts it own authority behind the Bible, even in those cases where catholic doctrine does not really find any support in the Bible (v.g. compulsory celibacy of Priests; worship of Mary and the Saints; purgatory).<br /><br />Raztinger (along with many other theologians that read lots of philosophy and theology but don't really take the Bible seriously) does a terrible harm to the Church and to those outside the Church that have never heard and understood the Gospel of Christ as proclaimed by the Apostles and forever registered in the Bible. Ratzinger's theology ultimately does not make any sense and generates of view of the Gospel that Apostles Paul and Peter would find repugnant and \\"anathema\\".y were never able to cite a single example of a mutation or any other evolutionary process able to increase the genetic information of the genome.               The Bible tells us that God created a perfect creation, but that sin brought death, destruction and suffering to the world. God cursed his creation, delivered a global flood, and promised to restore heavens and earth, without death and suffering. That's why Jesus Christ died for our sins, so that by punishing his inocent Son, God didn't have to punish those of us who accept Him as saviour and could give us eternal life with Him.     In the Bible, theology is always based in objective reality, and not in ingenious fables of myths, as the Apostle Peter would put it.      Joseph Raztinger's flawed point is: the Bible should not be taken seriously when it speaks about science and history, but it should be taken seriously whenever the Church puts it own authority behind the Bible, even in those cases where catholic doctrine does not really find any support in the Bible (v.g. compulsory celibacy of Priests; worship of Mary and the Saints; purgatory).      Raztinger (along with many other theologians that read lots of philosophy and theology but don't really take the Bible seriously) does a terrible harm to the Church and to those outside the Church that have never heard and understood the Gospel of Christ as proclaimed by the Apostles and forever registered in the Bible. Ratzinger's theology ultimately does not make any sense and generates of view of the Gospel that Apostles Paul and Peter would find repugnant and \\"anathema\\".	2005-04-24

In case you don't know, it was God who created the Universe, and not the other way around.     He is the Alpha and Omega points. He is not a creation of nature. He is the Creator of nature. Nature is the Beta point. Are you intelligent and wise enough to get that?     Once you understand this simple truth, everything will start to fit in and feel right, and it will help a lot to clear up your helplessly confused and senseless thoughts and speculations. Right now you have it upside down. You have to change your assumptions and renew your mind, as the Apostle Paul has put it.      You see, once your starting assumptions are wrong, the brighter you are the worse is the trouble your reasoning gets you in.     By the way, the thousands of anthropic coincidences that can be found in the macro and micro spheres of the Universe are exactly what biblical creationism would predict.	2005-04-12

He reduces life, God and eternal life to the limited observations we can make and to the virtually unlimited speculations he is able to put forward. The critical reader should be able to distinguish present observations (none of which contradicts the Bible) from extrapolations about the unobserved past and future. After that first operation, the critical reader will be able to notice that Frank Tipler is a master of the art of extrapolation, imagination and speculation. He is also a victim of a confusion of categories. For him God is a naturalistic Omega Point, where all mater, time, space, energy and iunformation converge and colapse. My advice to Tipler is: don't bet your life on your fallible (as well as unsubstantiated and in many instances simply wrong) speculations. Jesus Christ is the Alpha, Omega without whom the origins, purpose and end of this Universe lose their possibility. The biblical creationist model of creation, fall, Flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation, although it is as amazing as anything can be, is much more sound and coherent from a theological, philosophical, scientific and historical point of view. We should not try to find a place for God in our reason. Instead, we should try to find a place in God for our reason. He his THE REASON (LOGOS).	2005-03-09

It clearly points out the numerous reasons for us to believe in a young Earth. The theory of an old earth is a social and ideological construct, based on materialism, uniformitarianism and naturalism, without any true empirical factual basis.     Take index fossils, for instance. They are used to date sedimentary rocks, but it takes evolutionary assumptions to date them in the first place. So, this means that the ages of sedimentary rocks and their fossils, are not based in any empirical reliable dating method, but on evolutionary assumptions. Evolutionists may call that science, but I call it a logical falacy, petitio principium.    Take radiometric dating as another example. This method, in its varius modalities (v.g. uranium, helium, lead; rubidium strontium; potassium,argon), is used to measure the age of igneous rocks, and generally points to an age of millions of years. There are a few problems with this method, though: 1) all measurements are made in the present, by scientists in the present; 2) there is no way of going back in time and empirically confirm the dates; 3) the age is based not on the historical observation of the past, but on indemonstrable assumptions about the past, concerning the rate of decay, the closure of the system, and the quantity of parent and daughter elements; 4) the different methods of radiometric dating give many different results to the same rocks, and have in many instances to be corrected on the basis of index fossils, and these, remember, are dated on the basis of evolutionary assumptions; 5) the method sub judice provides old dates for newly formed rocks, as has been observed in many instance, a fact which undermines its credibility to data rocks with unknown ages; 6) it has been found that there is too much helium in zircons of apparently very old rocks, so this means that probably there were ocurrences of accelerated nuclear decay.     This means that radiometric dating methods havea legion of problems, and they are not really a very sound basis to solve the problem of the age of the earth. They really don't tell us how old rocks are, but only how old they might be if uniformitarian principles would hold. But they don't hold, and evolutionists don't give us any convincing reasons for us to accept uniformitarian principles in the first place. This acceptance is strictly a matter of faith and ideological persuasion.     The book then goes on to a subject such as carbon dating, with is really a friend of creationism, since it has dated many biological remnants as recent, when in fact they were found in very very old rocks. The book presents many other problems concerning evolutionary and uniformitarian assumptions about a old earth, such as the lack of erosion between sediments, polystratic fossils, etc., etc.. It also deals with many evidences of a young earth that take the whole earth as the basis for measurement, such as the decay of the earth's magnetic field, the salt in the oceans, the erosion of the continents, and so on. It has good ilustrations and some pages in the end for readers to take notes. This is due to the fact that it is intended to provide material for christian students. It is a valuable book that many secular geologists will have trouble dismissing, so it is possible that they will take the easy way of turning their heads and pretend that they just didn't see the book. Evolutionists have learned that the best, safest and easiest way to deal with creationists is to ignore their arguments, rather than to attempt to refute them.     When Goliah was making fun of God, God's Word and God's people, the israely army was is afraid to face him. But David simply could not stand it. He boldly went to face Goliah and dealt hem a letal blow. When Goliah was just begining to understand what was going on and what was happening to him, it was too late. As far as evolutionism is concerned, Christians should do the same. Evolutionary theory is a kind of Goliah that is mocking God and His Word. Christians should not compromise with it, not should they be afraid to go out and fight. Many evolutionists have not yet realized what is happening to their theory, but the fact is that a bunch of \\"insane, stupid and wicked\\" creationists, from outside the mainstream Universities, is shattering the evolutionary myths apart. Evolutionists, fo course, will always remain with us, as will astrologists, witches and Sun worshippers.       As was the case of Goliah, evolutionism is much weaker than it looks like from a distance. Creationists should direct their blows to evolutionism in areas such as 1) the cause of the Big Bang; 2) the origin of the Universe; 3) the origin of stars and galaxies; 5) the origin of the Solar system; 6) the origin of the Earth; 7) the origin of the Moon; 8) the origin of the oceans; 9) the origin of the mountains; 10) the origin of life;11) the common ancestor; 12) the lack of transitional species in current fauna and flora, the fossil record, and molecular biology; 13) the origin of DNA information; 14) \\"junk-DNA\\"; 15) vestigial organs; 16) ape-man speculation; 17) Archaeopterix; Archaeoraptor; Galapagos finches; Peppered moths and other icons of evolution, 18) the origins of sexes; 19) the origins of language and consceousness), 20) the age of ancient civilizations, etc. etc.,       This book another example of how creationism is being an effective David against Goliah. That is why the evolutionary establishment is as nervous as it ever has been, not only in the United States but in other countries as well (v.g. England, Australia, Brazil, etc.).	2005-02-22

Exactly the opposite of what Richard Dawkins, without any evidence whatsoever, has been saying to gullible evolutionists.      Since evidence of design is overwhelming (v.g. biology; ecology; anatomy; astrophysics), since no one has seen evolution happening nor has anyone found an information generating mutation, and since natural selection selects from pre-existing materials, eliminating information, we can only conclude that evolution is nothing more than a \\"social construction of reality\\" (as Peter Berger would put it), based entirely on materialistic assumptions without any empirical and foundational basis.     As the post-modern thinkers of our age would say, evolution is pure interpretation and narrative. Simply put, evolution is \\"science as fiction\\".      In my view, the problem of the intelligent design movement is that it does not go far enough. It reminds me the time of the Protestant Reformation, when the magisterial reformers (from their university positions) were not able to go all the way in reforming the Church because they compromised with the Catholics in matters such as the sacraments, infant baptism, national churches, etc.     It took the radical evangelical reformation (mostly from outside the mainstream ecclesiastical and educational institutions), to really make the necessary reforms. It was these reforms that oppened the way to political reform in the realms of republicanism, democracy, rule of law, human rights, freedom of conscience, constitutionalism, etc. We need creationist levellers, diggers and a Oliver Cromwell. Using english puritan jargon, we may say that intelligent design is still too \\"royalist\\".      Once again, it is necessary a radical evangelical approach to the evolutionary paradigm. Now, as in the time of the Reformation, a purely magisterial approach, such as the intelligent design movement, just won't to the job.  This is because it doesn't go to the root of the naturalistic problem. Besides, many of these intelectuals show some signs of intellectual and conceptual restlessness and confusion.      The radical approach is really one that starts with the Creator, and takes His Word seriously when it comes to understand His Creation. A willingness to compromise with the naturalistic and proud scientific establishment may seem very obvious and intellectually mandatory at first, but in reality it is part of the problem, because it doesn't approach this proud establishment from God's perspective. The intelligent design movement still gives the final word, the \\"competence of the competence\\", to the scientific community. Their \\"law\\" is still the \\"higher law\\": SCIENTIA LOCUTA, CAUSA FINITA!    As with radical reformation, radical creationism should have only one single prior commitment: The Word. In a fallen Universe dominated by relativity and entropy, the Word is the ony Absolut. Heavens and Earth will pass away, but The Word endures forever.     Radical biblical creationism must challenge the evolutionary establishment and its random, purposeless, fideistic, naturalistic assumptions head on: NO COMPROMISE!	2005-02-02

This is a most valuable collection of essays. They show the obvious: there is no evidence, whatsoever, of abiogenesis, common ancestor, intermediate forms in the fossil record and in  molecular biology, information generating mutations, and so on. What keeps evolution alive is naturalistic assumptions, plus circunstantial evidence (regardless of the fact that this evidence can be better predicted and accounted for through a creationist model) and naturalism-of-the-gaps-kind-of-faith. I only whish some of these authors would have developped their arguments a bit more, since the overall result, although quite interesting and stimulating, is a bit umbalanced.Maybe next time these and other creationist can put up a \\"Summa Teologico-Creationistica\\" or some kind of Creationist Encyclopledia or Treatise that could speak directly to the scientific community.<br /><br />My personal experience tells me that many scientists, while publicly afraid to show any interest in creationism, are already in the level of privately entertaining the thought that creationism may be right after all. The reason for that is that both arguments for creation and against evolution are increasing quantitatively and qualitatively in an exponentional way in all disciplines. This book has the advantage of allowing us a glimpse og the big picture, by exploring arguments in the fields of biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, geophysics, astronomy, physics, astrophysics, information theory, probabilities.

In this book he pretty much reminds me of those teenagers who turn out to make terrible mistakes in life just because they want to be accepted by their peers.     The truth is that Darwin's \\"god\\" - the author of death and death with abundance - is not the Bible's God - the Author of life and life with abundance. Kenneth Miller's book shows that he may have found Darwin's \\"god\\", but he really missed the God of the Bible.      Kenneth Miller decides to put his faith in Darwin and his disciples, instead of puting it in Jesus and His disciples. He judges the Bible based on the naturalistic speculations of athetist scientists, instead of using the Bible as the only and final parameter. In terms that Americans understand, we could say that Miller's  position is as silly as the Supreme Court engaging in the judicial review of the federal constitution to assess its validity on the basis of state law.       In a time like ours, where all recent evidence points towards information and irreducible complexity in biology, catastrophism in geology and post-compernicianism in astrophyisics, the best Kenneth Miller can do is to recycle some old XIX century totally unsubstantiated claims about random mutations and natural selection, add to it some clear scientific blunders (v.g. bad design arguments; information loosing mutations) and engage in foolish \\"darwinian theology\\".     He submits God's Word, which he finds hard to believe, to the criticism levelled against it by atheist naturalists, who, in spite of being proved wrong time after time (v.g.Pildown Man; Nebaska Man; Orce Man; Archaeoraptor; Archaeopterix; Galapagos Finches; Peppered Moths; Haeckel's embryos; vestigial organs; junk-DNA) Kenneth Miller still has no problem believing in a literal fashion. Something is terribly wrong with Kenneth Miller's \\"theology\\" and \\"science\\".     In the end, if Kenneth Miller really wants Darwin's \\"god\\", he will get it.    One's view of science determines one's view of God.     One's view of God, determines one's view of science.          Science should be based on God.     God shouldn't be based on science.          Darwin's god is based on science.     Therefore, it is a theological and scientific miscarriage.          God is the foundation of science.     Correct theology and science depend on His Word.          The Bible is not a scientific book,     But it provides the axiomatic foundations for science.          The problem is not science v. Bible    It is Biblical science v. unbiblical science.          If one starts from unbiblical science,     God is a gene-based delusion.          If one starts from the Bible,     naturalism is a sin-based delusion.	2004-12-13

A comparative and contextual apreciation of the actions of the Jews throws a much more favorable light in to them.  <br /> <br />What's more, I believe that God chose Israel (a small people) to show that he works in history in misterious ways, even when large empires are at stake. How exactely? I don't know. As everyone else, I cannot understand.  <br /> <br />The Jews have been persecuted and discriminated against by pagans, christians, muslims, secular humanists, for several milenia. The reason is not political, economical or cultural, but is essentially spiritual. We all are sinners (including jews), the sinful nature in all of us creates the potential for  hate towards God, and everything that may have some connection with Him (even in those of us who sincerely trie to know Him and understand something of Him).  <br /> <br />Since we naturally are inclined to hate God, we feel compelled (some times for reasons we ourselves don't understand) to hate the Word of God, the People of God, and the Son of God. Our western culture is filled with expressions such as \\"God is dead\\", the \\"Anti-Christ\\", \\"Death to the Jews\\", \\"Death to the Christians\\", etc.  <br /> <br />However, Providence is the ultimate force presiding over History, and the plain fact is that the Jews are getting closer to their land, agains all odds. Many of those who have persecuted Jews are now in the garbage can of history, the same place where those who now persecute jews will end.  <br /> <br />It has brought Israel back to its land, after almost two thousand years of exile. In the end, Israel will overcome, against all odds, not because of its own merits, but because God is true to His Word and His Covenant.  <br /> <br />I know this may seem odd to international politicians and legal scholars. This is certainly not something one learns in an International Law Treatise. But the Truth is that if the United Nations doesn't care about God, one should not be naive as to expect that God will care about the United Nations.   <br /> <br />I believe that even modern secular states will have to make a fundamental religious choice about Israel. I believe God will judge the Nations, based on how they treat Israel. This of course doesn't mean that we all should support Israel's every action, but we all should do well to support its right to exist in a State with a unified capital in Jerusalem.  <br /> <br />If God's own Word is any indication, this will happen, with or without the support of the nations. (More precisely, we know it will happen without the nations' support).  <br /> <br />God juges the Nations based on the way they treat His Word, His People and His Son. Faced with this reality, I believe, speaking as a Christian, that the only thing we all (Christians, Jews, Islamists and others) can do is to implore God's mercy.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-02

Their religion is called naturalist fundamentalism, a blind faith that goes against all evidence.  <br /> <br />This naturalist religion insists in advancing the idea that everything evolved out of nothing (as if nothing was something from which anything and everything could evolve!), that all univwerse evolved out of an infinitesimal particle, that life evolved out of non-life, and man evolved out of particles.  <br /> <br />Although it claims to be scientific, naturalist fundamentalism has not been able to put forward any objective convincing scientific proof whatsoever. No one of these types of evolution can be scientifically demonstrated.  <br /> <br />If you have any doubts, just consider the fact that naturalist scientists are yet to explain the cause of the Big Bang, the origin of the stars, galaxies, the solar system, the sun, the planets, the earth and the moon.  <br /> <br />More down to earth, naturalist fundamentalists have not yet demonstrated the existence of a pre-biotic soup, the accidental origin of life, nor have they identified the alleged common acestor, nor found the billions of missing links in the fossil record that we should be able to find if evolution really took place, nor have they been able to find information generating mutations that would allow particles to people evolution.  <br /> <br />All the other naturalist fundaemtnalists are yet too build a convincing case that gradual evolution is compatible with molecular biology, genetics and the fossil record.  <br /> <br />In spite of failing to answer all the fundamental questions, naturalist \\"scientists\\" keep blindly boasting their\\"scientific\\" claims, falling to see that as far as true scientific knowledge is concerned these claims have not yet left ground zero. In vain do we look for definitve answers to the basic questions in currentevolutionary theory.  <br /> <br />My question is: instead of wasting your precious time with the naturalist fundamentalism and with teachings that lead you nowhere, why won't one listen to the Word of the Creator imself when it cames to answer the basic questions about the origin, meaning and destiny of one's life? After all, the Creator is the only living witness to the Creation.  <br /> <br />It makes a lot more sense to me. If you one has the Creator's final Word right now, why wait for more tentative speculations and just-so-stories?  <br /> <br />If the Universe was Created by God (a possibility that science cannot exclude a priori), than the true understanding of the Universe is only possible with a New Kind of Science, one that allows for God to direct and guide it and that operates for the glory of God and the service of mankind.    <br /> <br />If all knowledge depends on indemonstrable assumptions, true knowlege about the Universe, Life and Man is only possible through faith in the Word of the Creator.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-11

In my view, this is a timely and urgent warning.     As many in the american intellectual elite replace replace the \\"dead white males\\" Roger Williams, John Milton, John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, George Whashington (et alia) by another set of white male (some already dead) such as Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Ernst Haeckel, Ernst Mayr, George Gaylord Simpson, Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, Michell Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Richard Rorty, Ricardo Unger, Daniel Dennett,(et alia) many in the academia are forgetting the the rights americans enjoy are result of a set of judeo-christian principles based on the notion that there a broader higher, deeper and stronger reality beyond time, space, matter and energy.     References to the Creator, the law of nature and of nature's God, along with the highest respect towards all human beings are embedded in american political and legal heritage and americans should not forget that for one single second.     It was this set of principles that made (and still make) America attractive, regardless of all the inconsistencies and contradictions of american society.     As Samuel Huntington puts it, America would be completly diffent if it were founded by Spanish, French or Portuguese catholics (not to mention fascists, nazis, comunists or political islamics).     Some politically correct intellectuals in America are afraid that a more public aknowledgement of the anglo-american protestant tradition will lead to discrimination.     But this has not necessarily to be the case.  Countries shaped by protestantism have generally a good record in human rights, democracy, the rule of law, transparence, economic prosperity and religious pluralism.     The same can only be said about some other traditions that have incorporated some of the same protestant principles. Remember that even the French Declaration of the Rights of  Man and of Citizens (1789) was largely inspired (if not written) by Thomas Jefferson, then american Embassador in Paris. Remember that Rousseau had a strong calvinist influence, whereas Voltaire and Montesquieu were admirers of John Locke and Mirabeau was strongly influenced by John Milton.     Remember also that the Universal Declaration of Human Righs (1948) would be unthinkable without the anglo-american protestant tradition that was victorious in the both world wars.     In our globalized times, when countries are closer to one another than ever, the world at large should also appreciate what America still has to offer, and urge Americans not to deny or be ashamed of the values and principles that have made them such a great country.	2004-09-09

However, when the assumptions are wrong from the begining neither integrity nor intelligence will save one from reaching the wrong conclusions. That's the main problem with Hugh Ross. <br />What's wrong with the assumptions of Hugh Ross? Basically, I see two problems: <br />1) equating science and the Bible as autonomous sources of revelation, which is problematic in the light of the words of Jesus according to which the heavens and earth will pass away but God's word endures forever; what's more, the universe has been cursed and men are fallible; <br />2)equating atheistic and naturalistic uniformitiarian interpretations of the facts with the facts themselves. <br />It is mainly due to these faulty assumptions, and not so much to lack of knowledge, integrity or intelligence, that Hugh Ross reaches conclusions (v.g. death and suffering before sin; the garden of Eden as a big graveyard)that are totally inconsistent with the plain teaching of the Bible. <br />What's more, Hugh Ross misses the point that the plain meaning of the Bible is totally consistent with the plain meaning of our truly scientific empirical observations (v.g. appereance of design; irreducible complexity of molecular machines; fine tuning of the Universe; lack of transitional forms in the fossil record; evidence of catastrophism in geology). <br />When one desperately tries to fit the interpretations naturalistic atheistic science with a supernaturalistic theistic Bible, one ot the other will have to cede at some point. For Hugh Ross, it is the Bible that will need to be reinterpreted so as to fit science. Too bad for him.	2004-06-02

It is interesting to notice that while Charles Darwin remains the main reference in evolutionary theory, it is becoming more and more difficult to show respect for the ideas of a man that, besides being mentally sick, didn't really know what he was talking about. Since Darwin thought that the cell was just a little bit of indiferenciated protoplasm, it was fairly easy for him to come up with some just so stories about its hipothetical evolution out of nothing. Random mutations and natural selection have proved to be incapable of explaining evolution. Today, what we know about DNA and molecular machines is enough for us to conclude that there is no such thing as simple life and that we can hardly imagine how the complex specified information in the cell could be generated without the work of God, the Super Inteligent Designer. Besides, all the mutations that are generally presented as evidence of evolution has proved to be totally incapable to generate new DNA information. What is remarkable is how easily the intelectual community accepted Darwin's just so stories. But then again, if one thinks about how easily many intelectuals accepted Karl Marx's &quot;scientific socialism&quot; one just has to conclude that most intellectuals will readily accept all kinds of nonsense, as long as it keeps God out of the equation. They call this science, but for me it is just a (not that clever) form of self deceit.	2004-06-01

It assumes that science is about statements of fact, and religion is about value judgements. <br />In its apparent plausibility, this notion couldn't be more naíve. Perhaps naive is not really the best word, since Stephen Jay Gould chose is words carefully so as to promote his naturalistic agenda. <br />The fact of the matter is: <BR>1) Evolution is itself interpretative, speculative and fideistic. In evolutionary theory, conjectures are much more important than the empirical data as such, because all the empirical data available (v.g. absence of intermediate forms in the fossil record and molecular biology, DNA information; catastrophism in geology; molecular machines; fine-tuning of the universe; mathematical improbability of evolution) points towards criation, not evolution. Evolutionary theory has not yet proved the casual origin of life, the existence of the prebiotic soup, the existence of the needed intermediate life forms, nor has it identified the evolutionary mechanism. On the other hand, the Big Bang theory has not yet explained the Big Bang itself, the inflation of the Universe, the origin of galaxies, stars, the solar system, the sun and the moon. So when Stephen Jay Gould says that evolution is based on objective empirical data, I really don't understand what he is talking about. <br />On the other hand, <br />2) The Bible clearly speaks of instantaneous creation ex nihilo, of the fall, the curse, and the flood. It also speaks about the comming of the Messiah. Lets talk about this last aspect for a while. Is there any historical evidence of the comming of the  Messiah? Well, there is plenty. Jesus Christ was simply the most important single person that the World has haver known. So the Bible is about historical facts, not value statements. In the case of Jesus Christ, there is abundant circunstantial evidence that God rose him from the dead, thus creating life from inorganic matter and inteligently designing a new and glorious body in a few seconds, not billions of years. This historical fact is more than enough for us to believe in the factual and objective ability of the Creator to create the world in six days. I understand that this may seem incredible, but the fact is that it is not blind faith. There is good empirical evidence for that, such as the fine-tuning of the Universe for life, the incredible ammounts of DNA information, the extremly complex proteins, molecular machines, cells and biological systems. In facto, the needed simultaneous presence of millions of nucleotides precisely sequenced to specify extremly complex biological structures and functions speaks more about instantaneous creation than about evolutionary gradualism or saltationism. The fotosynthesis mechanism is an example of an extremely complex structure that must be put in place at once or else it wont' work, and I don't see how gradualism or saltationism can solve that, nor does any scientist, not even all of them together. <br />Much more could be said about the objective nature of christian religion, as in the case of the curse, the flood, Babel, etc. <br />Some religions, along with many scientific theories of origins, are no doubt subjective and speculative and even counterfactual. But Biblical faith is as solid, objective and factual as anything else can be. <br />The whole notion of NOMA makes no sense. The Bible is magisterial and science can only be ministerial. NOMA is a naturalistic trap in which, alas, many christians of good faith and bad arguments have fallen. It is not so much about Bible v. Science. It is abou the possibility of acquiring real knowledge about the origins, the meaning and the destiny of our lives.  Contrary to commom held beliefs, faith in the Bible leads to Homo Sapiens. Faith in evolution produces Homo Ignorans.	2004-04-29

Hugh Ross may be well intentioned and in good faith, but he has really bad scientific and theological arguments.  <br />Darwinists will of course try to debunk this book, not by responding to it but by simply ignoring it. Darwinists don't know the difference between ignoring an argument a priori or responding to it a posteriori. <br />By doing this, they show that by claiming to be Homo Sapiens they really have become nothing but Homo Ignorans, defending the casual and accidental origin of all things (ultimately without any known physical cause) in spite the massive  evidence to the contrary. <br />Jonathan Sarfati has shown that the level of YE creationists arguments is far more complex and articulate than darwinists would like us all to believe. I recommend this book to every Pastor and christian teacher. The Church has been largely ineffective because the authority of the Bible has not been taken seriously in such a foundational subject as Creation.	2004-04-27

It puts forward the case that a ministerial use of reason and science should be preffered to a magisterial one, at least by christians who want to take the Bible seriously. Science has a real promise v. performance problem. The Bible, on the contrary, is as actual and relevant today as it has always been. The point is that a rational explanation for the Universe and life is not necessarily a naturalistic explanation. On the contrary. A rational explanation for the Universe is only possible if we assume that the Universe is rational because it was created by a rational God, who created us as rational beings with the ability of understanding it rationally. <br />Many still think that it is intellectually mandatory to believe in the Big Bang and in the Theory of Evolution in the name of reason and knowledge. <br />Now, considering that the Big Bang Cosmology: <BR>1) Cannot explain the cause of the Big Bang<BR>2) Cannot explain the inflation of the Universe<BR>3) Cannot explain the origin of galaxies<BR>4) Cannot explain the spacial distribution of galaxies<BR>5) Cannot explain the origin of stars<BR>6) Cannot explain the origin of the solar system<BR>7) Cannot explain the origin of the sun<BR>8) Cannot explain the origin of the moon<BR>9) Cannot explain the fine-tuning of the Universe for life,  <br />And considering that Darwinism: <BR>1) Cannot prove the casual and accidental origin of life<BR>2) Cannot prove the existence of the pre-biotic soup<BR>3) Cannot identify the common ancestor<BR>4) Cannot identify the missing links in the fossil record<BR>5) Cannot identify the intermediate forms in molecular biology<BR>6) Cannot establish once and for all the evolutionary mechanism<BR>7) Cannot explain the origin of complex specified information<BR>8) Cannot explain the origin of new DNA information<BR>9) Cannot duplicate the complexity of a &quot;simple&quot; cell<br/>One has to conclude that it doesn't take any sort of &quot;sacrificium intelectum&quot; to believe in special creation by the God of the Bible. It makes much more sense of the actual data, of the real world, of actual human history, of the origins, meaning and destiny of our lives. I fully recommend this book to all christians that want to connect revelation and reason as well as to all those non believers that are getting tired to wait for a &quot;scientific&quot; answer to their ultimate questions.	2004-04-21

Instead of comming to the obvious conclusion that the convergence of biological principles and mechanisms is the result of the inteligent design of a Common Creator, the author concludes by the inevitability of evolution. This is not fact. This is the author's convenient interpretation. Frankly I don't see any evidence that supports that conclusion. All the evidence supports instantaneous creation ex nihilo.The convergence of millions of nucleotides to precisely build and sequence aminoacids, proteins, molecular machines and cells and to assemble all that in highly complex and diverse biological organisms and systems cannot be axplained both by gradualism or by saltationism.

However, arguments about mtDNA are not convincing, since recent findings have been documenting a much faster mutation rate, than that most scientists have come to believe, including Steve Jones. <br />One is intriged by the confidence of Steve Jones in evolution: <br />1) has the casual origin of life been explained? <BR>2) has the existence of the prebiotic soup been proved?<BR>3) has the generation of new genetic information by random mutations and natural selection been observed? <BR>4) have the intermediate links of evolution been found in the fossil record and in molecular biology? <BR>5) has the mechanism of evolution been clearly established?  <br />Steve Jones is the kind of guy that starts his lectures with several anti-criationist jokes. This is not an accident, but is deliberately designed to take every opportunity to engage in creationist trashing. It usually works, though, due to the fact that most people in the \\"intellectually sofisticated\\" audiences of Steve Jones can't tell the difference between chance and design, anti-creationism jokes and anti-creationism arguments. <br />When it comes to arguments, Steve Jones can be a total disaster. Recently he said to a live audience in Portugal that ever since Charles Darwin has explained the evolution of the human eye without recourse to design, it became possible for science to explain everything without design.  <br />How about that for an anti-creationism argument? Or is it an anti-creationist joke? <br />One has to wonder what kind of explanation that was, given the fact that Charles Darwin was convinced that the cell was nothing but indifferenciated protoplasm. For instance, Charles Darwin din't have a clue as to the fact that the human eye as 400 000 photo-sensors per square milimeter in the retina! <br />This only goes to show why many evolutionists have decided to specialize in anti-creationism jokes, given their inability to come forward with convincing arguments for evolution.<br />One of the favorite anti-creationist jokes of Steve Jones is to start his lectures with a widely circulated set of pictures of quasi-obvious homologies of George W. Bush and a chimp and then use this to point to the \\"overwhelming evidence of evolution\\". Maybe this is the last argument in favor of evolution left to evolutionists! <br />This tactic has a (maybe not so) subliminar message: the attempt to link creationism to the american religious right. This has been a recent trend in evolutionist circles. Because they have lost in science, they have turned to politics.  <br />But then again, even this anti-creationist joke is misguided, both because it proves too little and it proves too much: <br />1) It proves to little because the Bush-chimp \\"homologies\\" can be as well used to prove a common designer (maybe one with some sense of humour).<br />2) It proves too much because by using the Bush-Chimp similarities as a \\"proof\\" of evolution, evolutionists are admiting that George W. Bush is a higher animal, at least superior in intelligence to a chimp. I don't know if it this fits their own political agenda in an election year.  <br />3) After all, if Bush is simply a product of \\"survival of the fittest\\" evolution, how can evolutionists criticize him? Even his invasion of Iraq can always be framed as a legitimate part of the darwinian \\"triumph of the most favored races in the struggle for life\\". What can evolutionists say against that? Wasn't this the subtitle of Charles Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\"? Don't evolutionists say that war is, by the nature of things, always biologically fair because it is inherently a \\"survival of the fittest\\" enterprise?	2004-03-24

The mathematical impossibility of evolution has been successfully demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt, by many scientists, religious an non religious alike. Remember Fred Hoyle's \\"Tornado in a Junkyard building a Boeing 747\\"? <br />One just has to think that, as has recently been determined, the chance that any kind of 200 hundred component integrated functioning organism (if there is one!) could arise by random mutations and natural selection, in all the world and in the assumed geological time, is less than one in a billion trillion. (Can we really understand these odds!?)<br />And this just for one simple putative organism, let alone for all the fauna and flora that has ever existed (with huge amounts of DNA and irreducibly complex molecular machines) and for human beings with their amazing brain, that many scientists say is more complex than the rest of the universe combined. <br />There is abundant literature on this mathematics and probabilities topic in Amazon.com. <br />Darwinists, like Dawkins, Mayr, Lewontin, Gould, etc, usually state that the fact that we are here proves that, even against all odds, we have evolved! As if that was the only possible explanation! Quod esd demonstrandum! <br />Compared with the probability computations that have been made, their arguments seem naive to the point of total insane. The much more probable conclusion is that we are not here by chance, but that God created us for a purpose and He alone can give meaning to our lives. <br />Dawkins'just so stories about climbing mount improbable only prove his ability to believe things that are incredibly improbable, without any clear and convincing evidence in the fossil record or in molecular biology. <br />Is there a rational basis for this belief? Of course not! Only a spiritual basis.<br />Given the total irrationality of the \\"evolutionry process\\" and of the \\"evolutionary theory\\",  it is easy to understand why it has become fashinable to hammer down evolutionists: due to the wild probabilities involved in evolution and to the lack of scientific evidence thereof, it doesn't take much intellectual effort do direct severe blows against the evolutionary paradigm. It gets very easy to point out the hidden assumptions, logical flaws and argumentative falacies of even the best evolutionists. Everyone can do it! So, just do it!	2003-11-08

It is strange to see Richard Dawkins going around bashing and trashing biblical creationists as pre-scientific flat earthers. The point is that biblical creationists are not a bunch of people living in a phantasy world. If we were, Dawkins would not be as worried and nervous as he is these days. The point is that we do challenge Richard Dawkins assumptions and conclusions head on, with direct statments whose validity can be checked scientifically by everybody. Here are some examples one some creatinists statemens that Dawkins and others have been having a hard time with:<br />1) Since life has been designed, we can find appearence and evidence of design in molecular biology and fine-tuning of the universe for supporting life. Just check the facts!<br />2) Since life has been designed, its origin cannot be explained by just so stories of prebiotic soup or random mutations and natural selection. Just check the facts!<br />3) Since life is the product of special creation, evidence of gradualistic evolution will not be found in the fossil record nor in molecular biology. Saltationism won't be able to explain it either. Just check the facts!<br />4) Since life is the product of special creation, small variations within kinds won't be able explain the generation of completely new kinds. Just check the facts!<br />5) Since there was a global flood followed by dispersion, many cases of rapid speciation are to be expected. But rapid speciation has nothing to do with evolution. Speciation removes information. Evolution is supposed to create it out of nothing.<br />Just check the facts!<br />6) Since there was a global flood, one should expect abundant fossil deposits, many cases of polystratic fossils and a significant amount of living fossils. Just check the facts!<br />7) Since there was a global flood, one has reasons to expect abundant evidence of catastrophism, plate tectonics, continental drift and the ice age. Just check the facts!<br />8) Since there was a global flood, one should expect the existence of many flood traditions around the world.

As he points out, when he discusses the subject of \\"ape-to-man evolution\\", the evidence for evolution gets so vague and fuzzy, that some evolutionists are now suggesting that we have \\"man-to-ape evolution\\" instead. Such is the quality of the evidence!!<br />Many people think that Biblical creationism, because it is based on a religious text, is more a matter of faith than of science. <br />I blame them, because they are terribly wrong and should know better. <br />Creationists start with assumptions, alright. So do darwinists. Creationists put their supernaturalistic assumptions forward. Darwinists tend to hide their naturalistic assumptions as long as they can (at least most of them). <br />Creationists come up with some predictions clearly falsifiable on popperian grounds. Here are some of them:<br />1) Nature has many signs of complex specified information; <br />2) Information is a non-materialist entity with elements of statistics, syntatics, semantics, pragmatics and apobetics. <br />4) The accidental origin of life is so highly improbable as to be virtually impossible;  <br />5) Since there is design, there is abundant evidence of appearence of design; <br />6) Methods used to detect design and information in other areas of human activity will detect design and information in the universe.   <br />7) In the fossil record, in molecular biology and in today's fauna there are no transitional forms between kinds (vertebrates; investebrates; fish, amphibians; reptiles, mammals, birds, etc; <br />8) Mutations will be rare, mostly harmful and unable to code for new structures and functions;  <br />9) Geology will show many signs of catasthrophism;<br />10) One can expect many living fossils and many polystratic fossils.   <br />11) The few alleged links will prove not to be such on a closer inspecion (v.g. Archaeopterix is a bird; Neandertals are Man)<br />12) There are no vestigial organs nor junk DNA. One should look for design functions; <br />13) There is no such thing as embrio reccapitulation; <br />14) Astronomical evidence will insist in debunking the big bang and the cosmological principle; <br />15) The universe should be fine-tuned for life;<br />16) Dating methods that assume uniformitarianism will give conflicting ages among themselves; <br />17) The Ice Age and Continental Drift can only be explained by a a global catastrophe.    <br />As you can see, when one is dealing with biblical creationism, one is doing much more than engaging in biblical exegesis. <br />Biblical creationism has all to do with making precise and verifiable statments about the real world. <br />Most of these statmens collide head on with evolutionary statements. That's the way, and creationists like it!  <br />If you deny or have doubts about the scientific character of biblical creationism, just check the evidence on those topics. Dare to do it!  <br />The proof that creationism is scientific is that it refutes evolutionary claims and evolutionary claims attempt to refute (so far without success) creationism.	2003-10-16

Haeckel was about to deceive people.  <br />11) the links are still missing and many &quot;extinct&quot; fossils have been found to be living after all; <br />12) creationist white-hole cosmology seems more plausible than ever, if the Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences is any indication.  <br />I have to conclude that, as far as the facts are concerned, my creationist &quot;faith&quot; is doing much better than Dawkins's evolutionary &quot;science&quot;. Better still, my &quot;faith&quot; is real science. Dawkins' &quot;science&quot; is real faith. <br />Because of his naturalistic a priori's, Richard Dawkins will never accept the lack of scientific evidence of evolution as scientific evidence for special creation.  He will always prefer to believe in evolution in spite the lack of evidence, than to believe in special creation in spite of the evidence. <br />That is the same as a judge being so biased against a defendant that he will convict him even if no factual evidence is available.  <br />Here we see the extent of Richard Dawkins' lack of &quot;intellectual due process&quot;.	2003-10-10

American Law in particular, owes much to Christianity, since the Bible played a very important role in the foundation.Marci Hamilton's article on \\"The Calvinist Paradoz of Distrust, Hope at the Constitutional Convention\\" is particularly clear on this point. The Declaration of Independence speaks about nature and nature's God as the foundations of liberal constitucional government.I wonder how America would be like, it its Constitution had been based on the \\"self-evident truth\\" that \\"all man are the result of a meaningless, purposeless and pointless evolutionary process of random mutations and natural selection, and so they have no self and no rights\\". <br />One of the points that needs to be made by Christian legal scholars, time and again, is the special dignity of human beings, against its materialistic, naturalistic, neo-darwinistic detractors. Alschuler points out the excessive influence of the \\"nasty\\" Oliver Wendel Holmes in American Law. In fact, influenced by the dominant naturalistic paradigms of poswitivistic scientism, O.W. Holmes once said (as quoted by Alschuler): \\"I see no reason for attributing to man a significance different in kind from that which belongs to a baboon or a grain of sand.\\" Well, as a christian I see at least one substantial reason not to do so:  Man (male and female) was created in the Image of God, as a rational and moral being, with free will and responsability. From this perspective, Man has nothing to do with baboons or grains of sand. Not even with chimps, as they are trying to make us belief with that \\"scientific myth\\" of 98,5% DNA homology. <br />Because of Man's sin, God himself assumed the image of Man, through Jesus Christ, and became the advocate that payed, through His life and physical ressurection, the penalty due for our sin. Thus created and redeemed, Man is incapable of being understood by means of naturalistic reduction. <br />Another point worth making is that of \\"Law as moral design\\", not just a random aggregate of adaptive strategies of \\"our\\" \\"selfish genes\\" (Richard Dawkins)or a kind of purposeless \\"self-organization of complex systems\\" (Stuart Kauffmann). As the dicta of Oliver Wendell Holmes about Man, baboons and grains of sand goes to show, Philip Johnson may have a point after all, with his seminal book \\"Darwin on Trial\\", when he warns against the ideological agenda behind the \\"scientific myth\\" of \\"particles-to-people evolution\\". <br />In fact, it is this ideological agenda, and not so much Holmes' nastyness, that has taken over a significant part of american legal scholarship, christian scholars notwithstanding. Christian legal scholarship, it seems to me, has no choice but to debunk naturalistic and darwinian accounts of the law, and to start from creationist and intelligent design assumptions. Science shouldn't be a christian's final authority, since \\"science\\" per se doesn't exist apart from basic assumptions (v.g. teism, deism, naturalism, uniformitarianism, catastrophism). However, thanks to the works of William Dembski, Michael Behe, Phillip Johnson, Werner Gitt, Jonathan Wells, Michael Denton, etc., it is becomming much easier to dismiss evolutionary arguments on purely scientific terms. Besides, darwinists have never proven their case with preponderance of evidence, much less beyond reasonable doubt. <br />As you suggest in your article, christian assumptions are far from giving us imediate answers to legal the questions and hard cases we have to deal with, such as abortion, homosexual marriage, freedom of expression, progressive taxation, redistribution, public policies, etc. I couldn't agree more. I spend a large part of my time trying to convince my fellow christian believers that that is in fact the case. <br />These assumptions may not even direct us christians to the adoption of a specific natural law theory, like those of man such as Augustin, Aquinas, Blackstone or John Finnis. Christian scholarship is compatible with adhering to different lines of legal theory. Only intolerant christianity would suggest otherwise. <br />Personally,  I must say that I am very confortable with a liberal contractarian tradition building on names such as John Locke, John Rawls, Thomas Scanlon Jr. and Brian Barry (although, like Michael McConnell, I tend to favour a greater inclusion of religious discourse qua tale in the public sphere. This is the true liberal tradition that has its roots in the Protestant Reformation. Like McConnel, I find comprehensive liberalism disturbing. <br />But I also enjoy reading and learning from legal theory schools such as CLS, Critical Race Theory, Feminist Jurisprudence, Civil Republicanism, Communitarianism, Law and Literature, Law and Economics, Law and Music, and so on. As the Apostle Paul suggested, I try to examine all schools of thought and retain that which is good. I think this collection of articles does just that. <br />Christian assumptions are still important though. In international law, for instance, it has become particularly clear to me that anti-mataphysical, naturalistic, darwinistic assumptions have reinforced positivism, statism, realism and pragmatism in the XIX and XX centuries. <br />Legal theory is not value neutral, and assumptions (either overt or covert) do in fact play an important role. All strands of legal theory struggle with sinful elements. But some are more openly anti-God and more prone to do evil than others, since they degrade human beings. As William Stuntz says, in his review of this book for Harvard Law Review,  \\"[i]t is worth getting the law right, and getting the law right may require getting the antecedent theory right\\".	2003-10-09

This is a very interesting book for those who care about the creation /evolution debate.<br />There are some very special features in this book:<br />1) It is written in a very logical and precise way. A typical example of &quot;Deutsche technologie&quot;.<br />2) It displays huge amounts of biblical, theological and scientific knowledge.<br />3) It engages in debate with mostly german scientists, philosophers and theologians, thus enlarging the horizon of the creation /evolution debate;<br />4)It makes explicit the hidden assumptions that seem to make evolution so plausible, in spite of the lack evidence thereof.<br />5) It applies Werner Gitt's information theory and its five elements of statistics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and apobetics.<br />7) It demonstrates that information is a non-material entity, as old Norbert Wiener used to say.<br />8) It demonstrates that the biblical doctrine of creation is incompatible with evolution;<br />9) It exposes the absolute non-sense of all those attempts to reconcile creation and evolution, on both theological and scientific grounds.<br />10) It exposes the complete lack of factual evidence of evolution and neo-darwinism.<br />11)It provides an useful glossary with useful explanations of the relevant terms.	2003-10-02

Gitt opens precisely with the well known dicta from Augustin. The really new element of this book is GITT's proposal of aplication of his five information-theoretic elements of statistics, sintax, semantics, pragmatics and apobetics to time. This strategy, along with the invocation of some of most relevant verses of the Bible on the subject of time, makes this book very precious for those who want to appreciate more this relevant resource that the Creator has made available to us.	2003-10-02

Richard Dawkins proceeds in his neo-darwinistic naturalistic crusade, after works such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improblable, among others. <br />He is a bright man, no doubt about it, but he will never make it, because he is running in the wrong direction. <br />Let me just point out some real structural deficits of his work, not necessarily confined to this book. If you think Dawkins has come close to solving the problems he deals with, think again: <br />1) The origin of the universe out of nothing remains a mistery. The two laws of thermodynamics postulate that the universe had a beginning. So does big bang cosmology.But how did nothing \\"evolve\\" to become something? Through random mutations and natural selection? Mutations of what? Selection of what? What was the cause? What was the mechanism? Has anyone seen it? Does anyone know? Notice that when I mean nothing, I don't mean any sort quantum oscilation or fluctuation, dark matter or anti-matter (that is already something!), but the total absence of matter, energy, space and time. That's the nothing I am talking about. Try to think of it. Good luck! <br />2) How did life come about? Can Dawkins give us more than a just so story here? He, or any one else, for that matter? Even Miller and Urey have come to realize that synthesizing two bases of nucleotides and two aminoacids is not to create life. Life is way too much complex. They have confessed that the origin of life problem is really much more difficult than they have imagined. How can Dawkins go around bragging about random naturalistic evolution if he cannot pass the first obstacle of that process? (the spontaneous origin of life) <br />3) Dawkins goes around saying that he has proven that gradual evolution based on random mutations and natural selection can explain the all the complexity existing around. Give me a break! Information theory has shown that there is no such thing as random generation of complex specified information (Dembski; Gitt). Molecular biology has shown many instances of irreducible complexity with no imaginable gradualistic intermediates (Denton; Behe). It has also been demonstrated that there is not one single mutation able to generate new DNA sequences of information that codes for totally new structures and functions (Spetner). The METHINKSITISAWEASEL argument is simply one of the childiest constructs I have come accross in my life time. Can anyone tell me how this argument can account for the generation of new complex specified information out of nothing?   <br />4) Dawkins keeps saying that intelligent design also has to account for the information generation and that it refuses to explain exactly when and how this information was generated. That may be a pertinent question to direct at the intelligent design movement, but scientific creationism (starting from the Bible) has a very good answer for it. <br />5) Dawkins keeps putting forward the \\"God's utility function\\" argument. As a creationism I have to agree with his point. Evolution is the most cruel, inefficient and irrational method God could have used to create man. The point is, He didn't use this method! \\"The so-called Bad design\\", when it really exists, is simply a deterioration of the created world, caused by sin and the following curse. <br />6) Dawkins insists on the notion of gradualistic evolution. The problem, though, is that we don't see any signs of if in molecular biology (Denton; Behe) nor in the fossil record, as Steven Jay Gould has many times pointed out. The fossil record points to abruptness, diversity and stasis, exactly the opposite of what we should expect by evolutionary predictions. On the other hand, the number of \\"living fossils\\" and \\"polystratic\\" just keeps growing, not to speak of findings of non-fossilized bones of dinausors! But the main point is that the links are still missing after all these years. In fact, there is less \\"evidence\\" today than in Darwin's lifetime. There are a few debatable \\"links\\", I know, but we shoud expect trillions by evolutionary predicions. A whole bunch have been proven to be fake (v.g. Piltdown Man, Nebraka Man, Archeoraptor; Haeckel's \\"recapitulative\\" embrios) There is not one single \\"link\\" that is consensual among evolutionists themselves. On the contrary, evidence of design and fine-tuning is simply overwhelming, by the trillions, altough naturalistic biased scientists like Richard Dawkins simply exmplain it away mockingly using terms such as \\"designoids\\" \\"appearence of design\\", etc. So much for scientific integrity and intellectual honesty!     <br />7) I have to agree with Dawkins, though, one he says that saltationism, punctuated equilibrium and hopeful monsters are scientific nonsense from a biological point of view. Steven Jay Gold was simply being \\"a nasty boy\\".   <br />8) There are more problems with evolution. The vestigial organs are not vestigial organs after all. They have turned out to have a design function after all. The same is true with much of the so called \\"junk-DNA\\". What's more, speciation has nothing to to with particles-to-people-evolution, since speciation reshuffles, sorts, exchanges or eliminates pre-existing information but it never generates new information. Evolution requires the generation of new information. Speciation has simply nothing to do with it. As to homology arguments, they don't prove evolution, since they also are arguments creationists like to use to talk about a common designer. <br />9) Natural selection, by definition selects some information and removes other information, but it never generates new information. That being the case, natural selection has nothing to do with evolution. Creationists don't deny natural selection. That, they can see. Creationists just don't see the point in talking about natural selection when discussing evolution. <br />10) Richard Dawkins has an open agenda. He wants to be a self-fulfilled atheist. If that's what he wants, so be it. Everybody wants to be a self-fulfilled something. That's OK. It is his choice (or perhaps he is being a victim of an illusion imposed on him by his selfish genes, as evolutinist phylosopher Michael Ruse would put it). There is one danger, however: becomming a self-fulfilled autist, by constantly avoiding and evading the (bio-;paleo-;geo-;theo-)logical implications overwhelming evidence of design and fine-tuning. If Richard Dawkins can say that the evidence shows a world without design is everybody expected to accept that statement without criticism and cross-examination? Is Dawkins the New Devil's Pope? Are we supposed to live by the Dogma \\"Dawkins locuta, causa finita\\"? Has science reached so low a point that all arguments in favor of chance are accepted as scientific and all arguments against chance are sumarily dismissed as non-scientific? To me this sounds as absurd as a judge accepting as \\"legal\\" only those arguments that point to the guilt of the defendent, and dismissing as \\"non legal\\" all those arguments who support his inocence. <br />11) Dawkins keeps reciting the mantra that people want to believe in God because they need confort in this tough and sad world. What do we make about this often heard argument? Well...nothing! Don't let Dawkins get you asleep on this one. This argument has nothing to do with particles-to-people-evolution, it proves nothing, it beggs the question and it is totally reversible. I might equally say that in a God's created moral universe, some people like Dawkins don't want to believe in God because, being sinful (we all are), they need the confort of avoiding the existential, moral and spiritual questions that keep comming to their minds. So Richard Dawkins sould avoid using this and similar arguments. They are \\"non sequitur\\".<br />12) Dawkins should remember that although he is a very intelligent man, he is just a man (by the way, I believe Richard Dawkins is more than a just a higher primate or a mere random collection of selfish genes, 95% DNA homology with chimps notwithstanding).	2003-09-19
US	47984649	RTJ07VBPFMD04	0890512914	871191711	The Long War Against God	Books	5	110	136	N	Y	Taking God's Word Seriously	I find it a sign of spiritual and intellectual imaturity when a young christian goes to the University, reads some books and then comes to Church and tries to debunk the Word of God based solely on human speculation. Well...\\"been there, done that\\". However, the more I read human stuff (and I read a lot of it for professional reasons), the more I realise that nothing compares to God's Word. Henry Morris is one of my favorite authors because he takes the Bible seriously. He starts from the Bible and debunks human \\"wisdom\\" (lack of it). That's the way to go. If you read what the Bible says about human wisdom, you have not choice but to do what Henry Morris does. <br />Here are some points about the book that I would like to emphasise: <br />1) Evolution could not be God's method of creation. It is too cruel, inefficient and irrational. Jesus' nature (the incarnate WORD), life and character are a vivid refutation of evolution. <br />2) (remember that in 3 days Jesus rose again with a new body. He didn't need 3 billions of years of struggle, suffering and death to evolve one). <br />3) Evolution is part of different pagan traditions that developed (specially after Babel) in the darkness of sin. These traditions have always been with us. Platonism and Aristotelism are just to examples of how these traditions influenced christian theology (Augustine and Aquinas), because christian theologians thought that the Bible might be missing something. Henry Morris, followint the teachings of Jesus and His apostles (v.g. Peter, Paul) simply states that the Bible is not missing something. If one reads the Bible, one has to conclude that that's exactely what the Bible teaches about itself. <br />4) The Sermon of the Mount is the proof that God has nothing to do with survival of the fittest. Every time christians engage in deception, violence, murder and genocide (which unfortunately they have done), they are violating the laws of the Creator and showing that \\"all have sinned: all fallshort of God's glorious ideal\\" Rom 3-23).  <br />5) Contrary to popular belief, science hasn't proved evolution, nor could it, because evolution simply didin't happen. If you think science has proved evolution, think again:  <br />a) the origin of the universe and the origin of life remain a mistery. Even Miller and Urey have confessed that life may be much more complicated than they have thought. How can one affirm evolution as a fact when the first step (the origin of life) of it remains a profound mistery? The prebiotic soup and abiogenesis are nothing but a just-so story.  <br />b)It is still to be found a single mutation that is able to create new DNA information that codes for new functions and structures. Mutations reshuffle, duplicate sort, exchange, remove or maintain pre-existing information. They just don't create new information. Natural selection removes information. Speciation is not evolution. Creationist only deny the latter. They perfectly accept (and predict) natural selection and speciation. <br />c) There are no transitional forms in the fossil record and in molecular biologicy. Based on evolution's predictions, we should expect trillions. The few that have been put forward are highly controversial, even among evolutionists. Not a single one is consensual among evolutionists themselves. <br />d) Vestigial organs are not vestigial organs after all. The same is true about \\"junk-DNA\\". Both turn out to have a design function. So much for another \\"proof\\" of evolution.<br />e) Evidence of design is overwhelming and growing. Examples of irreducible complexity and complex specified information abound. Fine-tuning is everywhere. Billions of examples. <br />f) Some so called bad design is simply not bad design, or it may be the result of deterioration. The Panda's thumb is actually excellent design, after all. Steven Jay Gould was just a \\"nasty little boy\\".    <br />g) Gradualism didn't happen. Creationists will have to agree with Steven Jay Gould on thisone. <br />h) Saltationism and punctuaded equilibrium are \\"scientific\\" nonsense. Creationists will have to agree with Richard Dawkins on this one. <br />i) Many geologists speak in terms of (Lyell's) uniformitarianism. But the rocks and the fossils themselves are shouting: \\"Flood!\\". The Flood remains the best explanation for the existence of numerous flood traditions, the fossil record, the continental drift, the ice age, oil and coal deposits, the catastrophic evidence of rock formation and displacement, etc.      <br />j) \\"Ontogenesis recapitulate phylogenesis\\". Just one more example of a failed attempt to prove evolution. Nice try. It has been refuted and Haeckel's embrios denounced as fake. The problem is that for many decades this was used to persuade people that evolution was a scientific fact. Many imature young christians used it to \\"debunk\\" God's Word. <br />k) Creationists are not against science. God's created universe is there to be known and studied. However, the Universe is not just matter, energy, space and time. It is also information. Information is the bridge between God's mind, the universe and human's mind. The more we appreciate it, the more we can see God's glory. Human brains and the Earth itself have been designed by God for scientific discovery. <br />Creationists just distinguish between operational science and origins naturalistic speculation. But the universe is also about God's moral law. Sin is a kind of virus that also affects the workings of the Universe. That's way God cursed the universe when sin entered the world. <br />The Universe has large amounts of information, but not all the information we need. There are somethings about God, creation, sin, curse, Flood, Babel, redemption, new creation, etc. that the uníverse is unable to inform us about. That's way we need the Bible.	2003-09-16

This is a very interesting book. Another one I recommend is Henry Morris' God and the Nations. Both books deal with a reality that modern man will have to face, like it or not: God is the Lord of History. The Bible says that in the end, one way or the other, all of us shall know that He is God. Modern rationalism, naturalism and materialism has come to believe that everything, from the origins of the universe and man to the end of both can be explained without taking in to account any Supernatural being. Well, this is simply wrong. As irreducible complexity in nature cannot be explained without the intelligent design of a creator, so history and the destiny of man cannot be fully grasped without considering the existence of purpose and moral design. Jesus Christ is the Alpha and Omega, the begining and the end. This means that everything can  only be fully understood by taking Him and His word seriously. Those who do that will be on the right side of history. Those who don't, will be on the wrong side of history. Marx, Freud, Darwin, Staline, Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Sadam Hussein, etc., were caught on the wrong side of history. Faith is Jesus and the God of the Bible is not blind faith. It can be argued and talked about with very rational arguments and plausible connections to the real world. If we want to make sure as to how relevant the Bible is today, we just have to turn on to CNN.	2003-07-08

I very much appreciate Kent Greenawalt's scholarship. It deals with the question as to if religious arguments can be used as a means to justifying public policy or legislation in a secular and religiously pluralistic state. So far as I can remember, Kent Greenawalt attempts to defend a secular public square where religious arguments should have no place and individuals and groups must give rational and publicly accesible reasons when they debate matters of public interest. While I am in total agreement with Kent Greenawalt in his defense of an open public sphere of discourse in a State of free and equal citizens, I tend to think that religious arguments can indeed be put forward (v.g. racism is a sin; abortion is a sin; gay marriage is not forbbiden in the Bible) and even be used as a reason to democratically aprove legislation. In an open sphere of public discourse people should be free to use the arguments they consider as being fundamental to the debate in question. But this, if and only if the public sphere of discourse remains open as to allow the religious reasons put forward to be challenged and mocked as any other kind of political speech. Religious arguments can be persuasively as is the case of any other kind of argument in a democracy. Religious arguments, like all other kinds of arguments, have emotional and rational components that appeal to some people and not to others. Religious arguments can persuade people like any arguments. The ceaseless critical engagement that constitutes a true democracy can clearly make use of religious arguments. To exclude religious arguments from the public debate would be as mistaken and discriminatory, from a democratic perspective, as to exclude metaphysical naturalistic arguments, nationalistic arguments or ideological arguments.	2003-06-27

Books	5	10	47	N	N	Darwin and Design: creative tension in science	Michael Ruse book is a valid contribution to the understanding of the debate that currently surrounds evolution and intelligent design. If Richard Dawkins can say that scientific evidence shows a universe without design, it is only fair that those scientists who disagree with this claim can refute it on equal terms. If Richard Dawkins can say that evolution allows him to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, it is only fair that other scientists may say that intelligent design or biblical creationism allows them to be intellectually fulfilled theists or deists. If Richard Dawkins can use &quot;bad design&quot; as evidence of evolution, it is only fair that other scientists may use good design and extremely good design as evidence of creation. I think that instead of making this debate a very nasty one, on the basis of outdated naturalistic and materialistic assumptions, all scientists should explore the creative tension and competition it generates, and make the most out of it. After all, the BBC News recently reported that in England the best scientific papers came from a school where evolutionism and creationism were taught on an equal basis, and because of this fact more schools will be teaching both perspectives in England (in spite of Dawkins oposition, who else?).	2003-06-25

One cannot really make sense of any other of the central doctrines of the Bible, such as sin, death as a result of sin, the need for salvation, the physical encarnation of Jesus, His physical ressurection, the promise of a new heaven and earth without curse and death, apart from the doctrine of creation and the fall. <br />As I read this book I took the opportunity to read and mark all the quoted texts in my Bible and even found more interesting texts. I had never studied the biblical doctrine of creation before, and I must say that the simple reading of the relevant biblical texts is quite conclusive: theistic evolutionism and progressive creationism just cannot be made compatible with the Bible. <br />If Jesus, the creator Word, can get himself a new ressurected and special body in a matter of seconds,  he can create the whole universe in six days. The opposite also makes total sense. <br />What's more, when Jesus multiplied the fishes and the loaves of bread and ressurected Lazarus, he didn't need trial and error nor randomness. He just did it right there. After all, the Bible makes it clear that he his the creator and sustainer of the universe, just by his Word. I just don't see why I should have more confidence in human scientists then in their creator.    <br />It takes a lot of argumentative acrobatics to even try to harmonize the hipothesis of evolution with the Bible, but in the end it just won't work. The Bible presents a creator that knows exactly what to do and how to do it. Random mutations is just not his way of creating things. Nor mutations nor natural selection are able to generate all the complex specified information present in living organisms. <br />The reading of this book made it clear to me that there are good and irrefutable theological reasons to support the biblical model. It also made it clear to me that we are dealing with an whole powerful God that is not very impressed with the science of the guys at Harvard, MIT or Oxford. The Bible says, in the book of Eclesiastes, that there are things that God has done that will never be understood by human beings, no matter how hard they study them. <br />But what about scientific reasons? In my opinion, you have to start by accepting the biblical account by faith, puting aside all materialistic and antimetaphysical assumptions. No doubt about it. But it is not a blind faith. There are good a priori reasons to this faith. I don't advocate just any kind of blind faith. <br />But once you accept the biblical notions of special creation, fall, curse, flood, Babel, dispersion and speciation, you will find that it makes sense of the origins of matter and life, the fine tuning of the universe, the fossil record, living fossils, good and bad design, DNA, homology, mutations and natural selection, speciation, irreducible complexity, complex specified information, apes and men, cave men, the emergence of languages and races, the ice age, continental drift, plate tectonics, radiometric dating, etc.<br />Most of all, it makes sense of the rational, moral and spiritual nature of man and of his longing for God and for eternity.	2003-06-25

The insights of Cass Sunstein helped to build a more persuasive case for religions freedom and equality in Portugal. Cass Sunstein addresses the constitutional question of determining the right baselines in those cases in which a Constitution confronts historically consolidated situations of inequality. In this cases, one must remember that the historical process is not necessarily a legitimate one. For instance (and this is where Sunstein'work  was important to me), in Portugal the Catholic Church became the dominant religion, not by means of gentle persuasion in a free marketplace of ideas, but through coercion, persecution and discrimination. This means that the search for the right baseline for treating equally the different religious groups in contemporary Portugal cannot start with the acritical acceptance of the current situation of fact. If a Constitution accepts reality as it is, without any concern for how this reality came to be, this constitution will turn out to be a partial constitution. Much more could be said about it, but my point is that Sunstein's argument, developed trough many topics that have nothing to do with church and state problems,  in fact helped to shape the current debate on church and state relations in Portugal, by focusing on the ilegitimate ways in which the dominant religion became so dominant and, by that, by allocating more theoretic and normative resources to the protection of religious minorities. After reading this book I've always tried to read everything I can from Sunstein. He is a great professor even when ocasionally I don't agree with him.	2003-06-19

His builds on the liberal tradition of social contract theories and on the rational quest for universal imperatives that could provide a solid structure for a free and democratic society in a world divided by different world views and conception of the good. In my view, this places Rawls in the lockean and kantian tradition. It is a typical \\"right prior to good theory\\", that is premissed on the equal dignity and on rational and moral competence of individuals. It is with these traits that individuals are idealized and placed in an original position behind a veil of ignorance. In this situation, where they don't know what their real position in society will be, they chose the principles that will form a just society.  These principles, concerning equal rights, access to positions in government and a concern for the improvement of those worst off even when inequality increases, are the principles of justice. Much has been said about the ideal character of the original position, the ideal character of its subjects, of the assumptions of equal concern and respect that lie behind this model and about the difference principle. The thing is that Rawl's theory of justice retains its appeal, because it is ultimately premissed in the equal dignity and freedom of individuals. It is interesting that this modern liberal understanding has a strong christian element that predates Locke himself. For instance, I remenber that one of the english levellers (Walwyn of Lilburne, I'm not sure now) a contemporary of Oliver Cromwell, has a writting in which he deffends that since there are so many different opinions in matters of religion, the power in the commonwealth should rest not so much in one given interpretation of christian ortodoxy, but on a sense of justice that derives from the consideration of all individuals as equal before God, worthy of equal concern and respect even when they disagree in matters of religion. In my opinion, only a theory of justice premissed in the equal dignity and freedom of every individual can provide a strong foundation for a free, open, fair and democratic society, based on the rule of law and on human rights.	2003-06-19

The Design Inference, No Free Lunch), Jonathan Wells (Icons of Evolution), Werner Gitt (In the Begining was Information) and Lee Spetner (Not by Chance), Michael Denton (Evolution, a Theory in Crisis) and Richard Milton (Shattering the Myths of Darwinism). To this we might add authors such as the Hugh Ross, three Morris, Gish, Ham, Sarfati, etc.<br />Michael Behe studies molecular machines (cilium and flagellum) and concludes for the existence of irreducible complexity that is a sign of intelligent design. He goes on to show that this evidence is generally denied on the basis of naturalistic assumptions, both metaphysical and methodological, and not on the basis of the weight of empirical evidence in itself.<br />Will Darwinian rethoric save darwinism from its present crises? No it won't, because, as even Richard Dawkins would admit, \\"designoids\\" are everywhere and they surpass in complexity everything that the human inteligence (including that of all the Nobel Prize winning scientists together) can produce. Appearence of design is overwhelming in nature and evolutionist's just-so stories, algorithms, and computational simulations just can't account for them.  Evidence of design just won't go away.<br />Complex specified information and irreducible complexity, generally recognized as signs of intelligence, are an integral part of nature. You cannot really understand all the features of nature without postulating an intelligence. As you cannot understand the existence, character and functioning of a Ferrari without considering the work and influence of Enzo Ferrari.<br />As a purely materalistic account of Shakespear, based on monkeys and typewriters, could not account for the literary meaning and purpose of Hamlet, so a purely materialistic account of nature cannot understand some of its most important features, functions and purposes, much less account for the personal, moral and ethical conscience of human beings, as well as for their intelligence, creativity and desire to know and understand the world.<br />Will intelligent design theorists offer a satisfactory alternative to darwinism? I doubt, because there are many other things that need explaining for which intelligent design simply has no answer, or is not bold enough to suggest one.<br />The only plausible alternative view to darwinism that really works both scientifically, historically, anthopologically, morally and theologically is biblical creationism, based on a model of special creation, fall, curse, global flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation, etc. Just like the Bible says. Will this view ever be acceptded? I doubt (even considering its powerful arguments).  That is because this view contains an element that is totally scandalous to the rational humanistic mind: the need for an unconditional trust in God's Word, as being the begining of all true wisdom and knowledge.<br />By definition, a sinful mind will alawys engage in God-avoidance and God-evasion. In dealing with operational science, it doesn't really matter much whether you accept God's word or not, because you are dealing with observation. But in origins science, when one is dealing to a great extent with facts that only God could have observed, (no man has ever seen particles to people evolution!) believing or not believing in Gods word makes all the difference.<br />Apart from Biblical creationism, what we will get is an endless debate between evolutionism and intelligent design on topics such as bad and good design, the generation of information, the fossil record, the origins of man, ultimately inconclusive.mately inconclusive.	2003-06-18

I also read many religious and secular books. Knowing Morris writings for several years, I've decided to order this from Amazon.com.<br />Yes, I am a product of brand of late post-modernism that tries to value at once both the reason of modernity and religion of pre-modernity, by connecting directly to the source of true knowledge and wisdom, Jesus Christ, simply through Bible reading and prayer. He is the LOGOS, the creator of space, matter/energy, time, life, mind and reason.<br />What does this have to do with the book \\"God and the Nations\\"? A lot, in my view. By reading the Bible, I became convinced that History has a begining and an end. What's more, there is a pattern in History, a sign of rational and moral design. So far, there is nothing new with this insight. Hegel and Marx would say the same thing. Francis Fukuyama would probably agree.<br />Historians have long realized that to understand History we cannot rely simply on political history, but we have also to take in to account social, economic and cultural history. I agree, although even this enlarged perspective seems to be insuficient. To understand History, we have to take in to account the presence of a divine providence in History (As someone put it, History is His Story). Other wise, we won't understand it. Even Samuel Huntington's \\"clash of civililations\\" is not able to account for what is going on in the world today.<br />With his characteristic lucidity and above average intelligence, Henry Morris leads us to the identification of the spiritual patterns in the emergence, decline and death of nations. My reading of the Bible has led me to pretty much the same conclusions, although I think that God cares also a lot about questions of justice and the environment that Morris somehow seems to overlook.<br />Anyway, it seems pretty clear from the Bible that God indeed judges the nations according to the way they deal with His Word, His mandates, His People of Israel and His Son. I agree.<br />As a Portuguese, I cannot help to notice that the emergence of our nation was closely linked to the defense of christianity in Iberian Peninsula, and that our times of historical glory coincided with the spread of the christian message. Of course we did lots of shameful and sinful acts in between, and we face God's discipline, as does any nation. It is interesting that a few decades after we expelled the Jews (around 1494), we lost our independence to Spain, and we lost our naval fleet, along with the Spanish, when the Spanish Armada was defeated in 1588.<br />Morris could have mentioned this, although he doesn't go this far. England and Holland, that were far more hospitable to the Jews and to the protestant reformation became the leading naval powers. All historians recognize that the defeat of the Spanish armada was instrumental to the progress of the christian reformation.<br />Another decisive point in human history, was the defeat of the Habsburg Catholic pretensions in 1648, after the Thirty Years War, and the Peace of Westphalia, whose art. 28º for the first time mentioned the right to \\"free exercise of religion\\" and paved the way to the liberal revolutions and to american constitucionalism.<br />The I World War was also very important to assure a western mandate over Palestine, and the II World War marked the begining of end of the jewish gentile dominium, which will only come to an end when Israel assumes control of the Temple Mount.<br />CNN tels the rest of the story, with the latest developments in Iraq and the war against terrorism, both instances where hatred to God, His People and His Son provide the relevant background.<br />I must admit that I have dificulties whith eschatology in general and the book of Revelation in particular. I've followed Morris on this topic with special caution. I didnt' clearly understand the future role of America, although I got some bad feelings about it. Morris position on the death penalty also raises some doubts. A criminal defendant has a right to a fair trial and to a proportional punishment. The death penalty is, undoubtly, proportional to a crime of homicide. No one can claim more rights to hemself than the rights he is willing to respect in others. However, it should be aplied only if the criminal system can assure a truly fair trial...<br />Morris' diagnostic and proposed remedies, as simple and naive as they may seem to be to much of the \\"sofisticated\\" audience of CNN or to the readers of Time Magazine or Foreign Affairs, are right on target.me bad feelings about it.

Revised & Expanded Edition	Books	5	17	26	N	Y	Important questions, crucial answers	The Answers Book is a very important statement of the creationist perspective. It is the kind of book I have difficulty to stop reading. It provides many informed answers to frequently asked questions, and remains faithful to the biblical creation / curse / flood / Babel model, and this is its main virtue, at least for several reasons. <br />Theologically, this is the only model that is able to make full sense of God's good creation, man's sin and sense of guilt, natural disasters,death as a result of sin, the various traditions of animal sacrifice, the promise of redemption, the life, death and physical ressurection of Jesus Christ, the promise of a new heaven and earth, with no suffering and death. All variants of evolutionary theism fail miserabily because they are not able to fit their scientific theories within a satisfatory theological framework. <br />Scientifically, the above mentioned model fits well with observable facts, such as the lack of the predictable transitional forms in comtemporary fauna and flora, in the fossil record and in molecular biology, as as been pointed out by evolutionary theorists as Steven Jay Gould and Michael Denton, among many others. It also fits well with the observed inability of mutations and natural selection to increase information, as pointed out by authors such as Werner Gitt or Lee Spetner. It also fits well with the presence of irreducible complexity in nature and complex specified information, as pointed out by Michael Behe and William Dembski, and the resulting wild improbability of chance explanations. It also fits well with continental drift and ice age problems, that are still to be solved by uniformitarian models. <br />Historically, the biblical model seems particularly relevant when it comes to deal with what more and more secular historians and archaeologists consider to be the black hole (Graham Hancock) of prehistoric historiography, dealing with the emergence of modern civilitations, of languages and races, the many reports of sightings of \\"dragons\\" throughout the history, the existence of hundreds of global flood traditions and existence of many cultural and architectural afinities (v.g. pyramid building) in many peoples scattered around the word. <br />Evolutionists will probably hate this book, because they will realize that scientific creationism is not just about religion. in fact, some of the most compelling arguments are clearly scientific, although they remain free from naturalistic assumptions. I understand that to many people, particularly to those who have a naturalistic \\"forma mentis\\", acknowledging the truth of the Bible may be unthinkable. But it makes perfect sense to me, not just spiritually and morally, but also rationally and intelectually. Above all, it confronts us with our creator, with our sin and with our need of repentence and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.	2003-05-19

Something radical had to be done about that. <br />According to this rationalist ideology (that had its own strange bed fellows), the Bible is dead (Welhausen), God is dead (Nietzche), and the People of both God and the Bible must die (Hitler). Again, Finkelstein deserves credit for daring to sustain his position. <br />For instance, the Bible states that King David ruled for 7 years in Hebrom and for 33 years in Jerusalem. Salomon was called to build the temple in Jerusalem. Both these facts have a profound historical, spiritual and eschatological meaning. Based in the lack of evidence (for which many reasonable explanations exist), Finkelstein simply denies the existence of an United Kingom of David and Salomon. By doing this, Finkelstein directs an atack against the central spiritual tenets of judeo-christian faith and hope. <br />This doesn't mean that Finkelstein is a bad guy. On the contrary, to be fair we sense an inherent willingness to be intellectually honest. However, due to his own assumptions and the limited character of his investigation, he overplays his explanation based on the political and ideological motives behind the Bible. <br />According to Finkelstein, the jewish way of dealing with political and military problems in 600 bC was: \\"If everything else fails, try metanarrative\\". Religion fictions apart, Jews should be seen, above all, as experts in the art of forging documents and inventing metaphysical and moral entities. (Even Finkelstein must admit they were pretty successful at that). This view, that raises more questions than the answers it pretends to put forward, is simply not plausible. <br />The historically sober, spiritually powerful and ethnologically sound narratives of the Bible, as well as the inherent rationality of most of its characters (recently restated by Steven Brams in the book Biblical Games, MIT), are not easily understood from the point of view of Finkelstein's framework of political and ideological convenience. <br />I think Fikelstein's perspective is too materialistic, as far as the origin of the Bible is concerned, in the sense that he expects too much from the political, economic and social realities, and downplays the spiritual a moral forces at work. <br />If one takes the Bible seriously, from Genesis to Revelation, it doesn't take long to realize that we are dealing with something that far transcends conjuntural power games and politics. Finkelstein is far off the mark. <br />It happens that the Bible, as an old collection of Books, is more than used to this kind of \\"letal atacks\\" and provisional \\"refutations\\", that in the end prove themselves to be wrong. The Bible, as a surviving book, is a good example of the survival of the fittest. Actually, the creation v. evolution debate is just another example of biblical survival, as we can see when we consider the recent contributions of authors as diverse as Gish, Morris, Ham, Safarti, Humphreys, Gitt, Dembski, Behe, Johnson, Denton, Spetner, just to name a few. <br />As a matter of fact, recent archeological findings actually support the case for the flood, the exodus, the conquest, the united kindom of David and Salomon. There are many powerful lines of criticism directed to Finkelstein's work. <br />If it was allabout politics, why waste so much time and effort on the spiritual and moral experiences and shortcomings of David and Salomon? Of course, men like Finkelstein and Herzog, among others, will probably try to ignore the evidence that contradicts their assumptions for as long as they can, as many others before them have tried to do... ultimately without success.	2003-05-12

It surely isn't meant to discuss flat earth theories. Intelligent design should be seen most of all as a legitimate conclusion derived from the application to nature of generally accepted means to detect design everywhere else. ~<br />One should notice the deliberate attempt to link the intelligent design movement with creationism. This attempt is misguided at least for three reasons: <br />1) it ignores that for many theistic evolutionists, evolutionism is also a form of creationism, since they believe that God created matter and life and then put the evolutionary process in motion. So why not speak also of evolutionistic creationism? Evolutionists have not yet provided a convincing case of spontaneus generation of matter and life, from nothing and non-life respectively; <br />2) it ignores the fact that the intelligent design movement is very different from biblical creationism, since it doesn't start from the biblical model of creation / fall / curse / flood / Babel / etc., but merely attempts to detect design when it sees irreducible complexity or complex specified information, by means of generally accepted ways (v.g explanatory filters) of detecting and measuring design in multiple fields of life. If matter shows indeed signs of design, it is unscientific not to account for those signs. There is no truly scientific a priori requirement to keep turning our heads pretending we just don't see design in nature. <br />3) it assumes that biblical creationism is all about religion and not about science. One has only to read Gish, Morris, Humpreys, Ham, Safarti, among many others, to realize that this assumption is false. The biblical model starts with clear religious assumptions, states them openly (many evolutionists have for decades tried to hide their anti-religious naturalistic agenda, without success, builds a model that interpretes the facts consistently, makes predictions and draws on the various internal contradictions of evolutionary theory (v.g. molecules v. fossils; arboreal v. cursorial; regional v. out of Africa). In fact, it must be said that after books from non creationist authors such as Werner Gitt, William Dembski, Michael Denton, Michael Behe and Lee Spetner, just to quote a few, biblical creationism has been much reinforced. <br />Pennocks' book shows articles by authors such as Philip Johnson, Michael Behe and William Dembski. Richard Dawkins insists on his bluff of an \\"intelectually fulfilling atheism\\" (autism?), without resolving his dead end debate with Steven Jay Gould. At the same time, some articles discuss the alleged shortcommings of biblical creationism, by focusing on the \\"manipulative\\" debating technics of Duane Gish and the ICR, a convenient charge when one is not able to respond to Gish. To the authors of this criticism I just say: please just try to answer convincingly the various creationists' true arguments, and not some \\"straw man\\" versions of them. Scientific debate would much benefit from that attempt.<br />The alleged difficulties of the Flood (v.g. dispersion; rapid speciation), pointed out in the book, have been answered persuasively by creationists, much earlier then this book, even using arguments of Ernst Mayr and some experiences made by Darwin himself on snails and seeds. Before discounting the Flood, modern science should humbly remember that if we were only to trust its explanatory models and predictions the Pyramids would be an historical impossibility. But there they are, for all to see, still driving evolutionary scientists crazy after all these years. So are the evidences of creation, curse and flood. They just won't go away. That's why creationism will always remain with us. In fact, I'm glad it will, in the name of science, because most ot the most daring challgenges to evolutionary theories have come from creationists, and so far, science has only proved them right.	2003-04-28

This book is yet another attempt to refute creationism, both old and new. However, it suffers from some of the same basic flaws present in Pennocks' edition on New Creationism from MIT, a collection of articles put together in a controversial way. Im refering to those articles that also attempt to refute creation. <br />First of all, any refutation of creationism will only have a claim to viability if it comes up with a convincing account of how matter \\"evolved\\" from non-matter,  and how life evolved from non-life. All attempts so far have proven useless. It is always a motive of great fun and enjoyment for a creationist to observe evolutionists \\"in action\\" in those fields. If one wants a good laugh thats the place to go. It is even better then watching Eurosport's WATTS ZAP, with all those pictures of funny sports moments. <br />It is true that Pennock attempts to give \\"evidence\\" of evolution, specially in chapters 2 and 3, and tries to criticize creationists arguments. He has a problem, however. Before he refutes intelligent design, something he calls new creationism, it would be good if he could refute old creationism. Old creationism has been \\"refuted\\" many times, but it has never been refuted once and for all. <br />It is regretable that Pennock never gives one single example of an \\"information generating mutation\\", nor is he able to explain how natural selection, which inherently removes unnecessary traits, is able to generate more information rich DNA. Well, maybe we should not expect him to boldly go where no man has gone before. <br />We still don't know where are the all the transitional forms we should expect in today's fauna, in the fossil record and in molecular biology. Besides, Pennocks criticism of new and biblical creationism is incredibly poor and naive, since most of his arguments show an amazing lack of knowledge of creationists positions such as those of Kem Ham or Jonathan Safarti. In this respect, this book is clearly like the MIT collective opus, where much of the criticism that is directed against biblical creationists rests on \\"straw man\\" versions of it and ignores convincing answers that have been available for some time now in many earlier books by creationits such as John and Henry Morris, Duane Gish, Ken Ham, Jonathan Safarti and many others. <br />It is time that darwinists take some time to read the authentic creationists' arguments, instead of criticizing versions of creationism that are not found in the most prominent creationist authors and that are probably the creation of darwinists themselves.	2003-04-11

So what do we get out of Darwin's dangerous idea these days? Very little indeed. Dennett's attempt to save evolution by linking it to the concept of freedom may seem clever at first, but is not enough to rescue this scientific unsubstantiated conjecture. Please remember that theorizing about freedom from the point of view of evolution adds nothing to the \\"particles to people\\" general theory of evolution. It only distracts the public from the fact that we are still to see one example of an \\"information generating mutation\\", and that 150 years after darwin we still have only a handful of fragmentary and dubious transitional forms, when we should expect tens of thounsands in today's fauna, in the fossil record and in molecular biology. What's more, many of the traditional arguments for evolution (vg. natural selection;radiometric dating; geological uniformitarianism; embryonic reccapitulation; dino-to-bird evolution; vestigial organs; junk-DNA) have proven to be false and been discarded. I guess that in an even more desperate attempt to save evolution, Daniel Dennett will probably link it with even more popular concepts. His next book will probably be titled \\"Microsoft evolves\\", \\"Ferrari evolves\\" or \\"MTV evolves\\". Those wouldn't save evolution either. <br />We just have to read books from authors as different as Richard Dawkins, Steven Jay Gould, Michael Denton, Richard Milton, Michael Behe, William Dembski, Phillip Johnson, Douane Gish, John and Henry Morris, Ken Ham and Jonathan Safarti, to realize that current algebric situation of evolution is this: <br />\\"arguments for evolution\\" - \\"naturalistic assumptions\\" - \\"arguments for evolution refuted by biblical creationists and intelligent design theorists\\" - \\"arguments for evolution refuted by evolutioniststhemselves\\" = very little indeed. <br />The molecules v. fossils debate is a clear example of the patetic situation of darwinism: on the one hand, punctuated equilibrium is biologically impossible, while on the other hand gradualism is paleontologically unsubstantiated. Richard Dawkins and Steven Jay Gould cancel each other's rancourous arguments, while happily joining hands as evolutionist zealots to fight creationism and intelligent design. <br />Daniel Dennett is a \\"genetic arminian\\", defending free will, attempting to debate \\"genetic calvinism\\" and its forms of \\"genetic predestination\\". The problem is that for one to speak about free will one needs to have a self in the first place. However, many neo-darwinists these days say that to believe in the self is the same as believing in fairy tales or Santa. There is no such thing as a \\"ghost in the machine\\". There are only a bunch of \\"selfish genes\\" and \\"meme machines\\" purposelessly and meaninglessly doing what follows naturally from \\"brain states\\", as a means to adapt and to survive. Of course, these neo-darwinists put themselves in a dead end, since by denying the self, they also deny rationality, rational knowledge and their own pretensions of knowledge of the world. If there is no self, there is no \\"who\\". So we shoud ask: \\"What\\" is knowing what? \\"What\\" is free to do what? If there is no self, no meaning and no purpose, what is the point of surviving at all? Dead matter \\"survives\\" as such, just by staying dead matter. What is the point of random mutations and natural selection? Meaningless life is no better than meaningless death. The proof that nature \\"understands\\" these questions is the fact that no one has ever seen life emerging spontaneously by chance. What would be the point of that? The mistery that still surrounds the appearence of self replicating life is enough to undermine the entire evolutionary project.   <br />Freedom may evolve, so does MTV, while evolutionary nonsense surely does run free.	2003-04-07

This particular book puts forward a sample of hard questions that evolutionists simply can't answer convincingly. For those who like to read about this subject, this book has only one disadvantage: it only takes a couple of hours to read it.<br />This book by Jonathan Safarti exposes the naturalistic assumptions that are used to define science in a priori materialistic terms, and transform the scientific community in a closed circle of naturalistic friends and some acolites of a purely subjective religious persuasion. Count me out. I simply do not accept those naturalistic rules of the game. They are not required by a true science, one the is ready to go so far as the evidence leads, one that is ready to boldly go where no naturalist philosopher or scientist has gone before. Naturalists have to have faith that somehow nothing evolve to become something, that non-life generated life, that invertebrades became vertebrades, and apes evolved to become man. For them, also, faith is the certainty that something happened that they could not and cannot see.<br />One cannot separate science and christian religion. Both envolve facts and assumptions. If God created the world, including our minds (and science cannot rule that out), then he must have a say in the formation and nature of the real world and of our minds, as well as in the connection between the too. God, the Absolute Reason, the intelligent designer of the universe, allows for the connection between objective reality and subjective knowledge of this reality.<br />Since science cannot prove the inexistence of a Creator, so it cannot define itself as excluding the possibility of there existing one. Richard Dawkins says we are overwhelmed by appearence of design and surrounded by \\"designoids\\". But we now know that \\"specified complexity\\" (Dembski) and \\"irreducible complexity\\" (Behe) are scientific notions that allow us to infer design with reasonable certainty. A refutation of design would rest on improbabilities of the wildest order. Design in nature is not just apparent. What's more, design is not just a purely subjective theological interpretation of the facts. It can now be detected and measured with formal rigour and precision, through the concept of complex specified information, in the same way we infer design in all other fields of human activity. So, if specified complexity can detect intelligence, design and information everywhere else, why not in nature? Why reject objectively detected and measured design in nature just because we have an a priori subjective naturalistc dispostion to do so? Steven Jay Gould's NOMA concept doesn't make any sense. But if evolutionists really want to stick to that concept, at least they should understand that naturalistic philosophy and true empirical science should also be treated by their own standards as two non-overlapping magisteria.reasonable certainty. A refutation of design would rest on improbabilities of the wildest order. Design in nature is not just apparent. What's more, design is not just a purely subjective theological interpretation of the facts. It can now be detected and measured with formal rigour and precision, through the concept of complex specified information, in the same way we infer design in all other fields of human activity. So, if specified complexity can detect intelligence, design and information everywhere else, why not in nature? Why reject objectively detected and measured design in nature just because we have an a priori subjective naturalistc dispostion to do so? Steven Jay Gould's NOMA concept doesn't make any sense. But if evolutionists really want to stick to that concept, at least they should understand that naturalistic philosophy and true empirical science should also be treated by their own standards as two non-overlapping magisteria.	2003-04-02

The end result would be a purely rationalist, materialist and naturalist account of the christian message. Or better still, its total destruction. <br />Rationalism and darwinism played an important part in this programme. Armed with their own naturalistic prejudices, theologians like Graaf, Welhausen, Bultmann, have spent their lives attempting to demythologizing the Bible. Darwinism was seen by many, including christians, as a fatal blow in the authority of the Bible. Well, after two centuries we are lucky enough to know for sure that they have failed. We can now clearly see that their strategy has been flawed since the begining. <br />I specially enjoyed that one about the creationist founder of Scientific American. Creationists do care about science after all. <br />Jonathan's Safarti's work demonstrates that the time has come for the Bible to strike back and demythologize science. The first victim, as Safarti notes, should be the silly Gould's NOMA concept, that relates science to the real world and confines religion to your head. This idea couldn't be more nonsensical, once you believe that God created the real world, including your mind. In fact, it is God that makes any objective scientific knowledge of the real world by your subjective mind both possible, reliable and meaningful. <br />Many evolutionists's arguments are so silly that they seem to be deliberately designed to prove, beyond any doubt, that there is no essencial difference between men and apes in the way they think. But the simple fact that evolutionists like Dawkins or Gould are able to articulate and express thoughts, as silly as they may be, through language is enough to differentiate them from primates in an essential way. The best way for evolutionists to prove their point about the lack of any significant difference between man and apes would be for them to stop with all their scientific writing and with all other specifically human activities.  <br />We can now state that evolutionism in itself is a myth based on an inconsistent set of myths. Just think of the \\"big bang\\", \\"prebiotic soup\\", \\"cambrian explosion\\", \\"fossil record\\", \\"gradualism\\", \\"punctuated equilibrium\\", \\"vestigial organs\\", \\"junk-DNA\\", \\"macroevolution\\", \\"transitive forms\\", \\"dino-to-bird\\", \\"embrionic recapitulation\\", etc., etc. <br />Darwinists like Gould, Mayr, Lewontin, and Dawkins are some of the most creative mythmakers these days. They have never generated one single compelling fact that could prove evolution beyond reasonable doubt. The overwhelming majority of scientists that believe in these myths do so because mostly because they have never really confronted the evidence to the contrary, as I myself had the opportunity to realize several times, when I confronted some geology and biology's PhD's in my University. They were surprised at the strenght of my \\"fundamentalist\\" arguments, but just couldn't answer them. They simply conceded that I had done my homework. That experience made me realize creationists were really on the right track. <br />Jonathan Safarti's book demonstrates that Richard Dawkins' \\"right reasons\\" to believe in evolution are not quite right after all, as even Steven Jay Gould would agree, and that Steven Jay Gould's huge leaps of evolutionary faith are not in fact scientifically grounded, as even Richard Dawkins would agree. We know for sure that both Gould and Dawkins represent the most fervent and devout evolutionists. But we also know for sure that their arguments, in spite of their inherent flaws, cancel each other. As Safarti points out, we don't have to misquote them to figure that out. We only need to quote them. <br />Evolutionists of the world... give me a break!	2003-03-03

God Exists!: Rethinking the Case for God and Christianity	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Taking the Bible seriously	Some people may say that Gary Harbemas's book is just about quoting scripture. That is not true, for that matter. <br />But I want to leave a word of caution to those who dismiss the Bible too fast. Can they understand modern republican, democratic and human rights standards without reference to the New Testament? Can they understand world history and contemporary reality without quiting the Bible? <br />The truth is that the world is not coming from where men like Darwin, Dennett, Dawkins or Gould say it is coming from, nor is it going where men like Hegel, Marx, Engels, Lenin or Hitler (or Fukuyama, or Huntington) have thought is is going. Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. <br />Darwinism has failed to give a convincing account, by any \\"preponderance of evidence standard\\" (much less by any \\"beyond reasonable doubt standard\\"), of the origins of energy, matter, space and time. It has failed to give a convincing account of the origins of life, the information in DNA, macroevolution, complex specified information in the universe and in biological systems, the mathematical and computational structure of nature, human consciousness and moral awareness. The cambrian explosion, the cataclismic structure of the fossil record, the gaps in the fossil record, the movement of continents, the ice age, the extinction of dinossaurs, the flaws in radiometric mechanisms, are just a fez of the many questions the darwinism has still to answer convincingly. I am convinced that the Bible knows more about all these topics than many people believe. Actually, the Bible knows more about everything than most people would believe. <br />Take the example of Adolph Hitler. He wanted history to go his way. He wanted to have the final word in the destiny of the Jewish people. In this he was much inspired by Darwin, Spencer and Haeckel, when it came to \\"the survival of the most favored races in the struggle for life\\" (Darwin, sub title to the Origins of the Species). The \\"Cristal Night\\" happened in October 1938. The terrible Holocaust would soon follow. Ten years later, though, Hitler was dead and the State of Israel was being internationally recognized, to the surprise of many Jews. <br />The begining, the course and the end of history are not for men to decide. It is up to God to decide that. We are free and responsible beings, but God never loses control of the events in history. In human history (His-Story) we are given the possibility to chose freely and responsibly to reconcile ourselves with God and follow Him, through Jesus Christ (God made flesh). If we reject that and try to to do things our way, we will end up somewhere in the garbage can of history (like the Pharao in Genesis,Judas in the New Testament, like Darwin, Marx, Hitler, Staline, Bin Laden), and will be seen as examples of what shouldn't be done. As Mark Twain said, history may not repeat itself but it very often ryhmes. The moral design and divine purpose of history make it rhyme very often, leading it always to where God wants.	2002-07-25

As we read books such as the Selfish Gene, we notice that behind the appearence of scientific discourse there is always a just-so story and a naturalistic question begging assumption. <br />In the end, if you remove just-so stories and naturalistic assumptions from evolutionary theory you get very little indeed. More than 140 year after Charles Darwin we notice that evolutionary theory suffers from a serious promise v. performance problem. It has simply failed to deliver. <br />It has failed to account convincingly for the origins of matter and the universe, prebiotic soup and abiogenesis, the cambrian explosion, the polystrata fossils, the origins, sequencing and replication of DNA and cellular life, macroevolution, the origins of complex specified information, for the function of \\"vestigial organs\\" and \\"junk-DNA\\", for the flaws and evolutionary assumptions that underly the various uraniun-helium, potassium-argon and radiocarbon dating methods. <br />We can get no satisfaction when we read all the circular and tautological responses that darwinists have to all these questions. Not to mention the faked \\"Icons of Evolution\\",as demonsttrated by Jonathan Wells, and the surrealistic debates between men like Richard Dawkins and the late Steven Jay Gould. The more I read Richard Dawkins \\"vestigial positivism\\" the more I am interested in creationism of the Douhane Gish, John and Henry Morris and Russell Humphreys kind. <br />At least it is able to give a more complete account of human physical, emotional, moral and spiritual existence of Man, as well as of the fine-tuning of the universe. <br />Many non-creationists are having this same feeling that something is terribly wrong with the dominant evolutionary paradigms. The emergence of self-organization and complexity theories (v.g. Stuart Kaufman), of cellular automata theories (v.g. Stephen Wolfram) and of intelligent design theories (v.g. Michael Behe, William Dembski and Phillip Johnson) are more than enough to demonstrate that many more people can get no satisfaction with darwinism either. <br />Even english journalist and writer Graham Hancock, author of (among other best sellers) the recent book Underworld, has a strong case against the dominant paradigms in history, geology, archeology, anthropology and evolutionary theory. <br />John Stuart Mill he wrote, as a part of his arguments in is essay On Liberty, that \\"If even Newtonian philosophy were not permitted to be questioned mankind could not feel as complete assurance of its truth as they do now\\". Many things seem to have changed since John Stuart Mill. Newtonian philosophy has been displaced long ago by general relativity and quantum mechanics. <br />But what is troubling is that Darwinism wants to secure the \\"assurance of its truth\\" not by being questioned, but by avoiding question and dissent. This is not scientific nor liberal in the true sense of word. As Mark Twain would say, that is not english, that is not american... that's french!	2002-07-12
US	47984649	R2E95BRT4NHDH6	1579550088	20378952	A New Kind of Science	Books	5	16	73	N	Y	A new kind of scientifc debate	Stephen Wolfram's book is very interesting. I am still reading it and waiting for the specialized reviews of its most difficult parts. I am a layman, not a scientist, but here are my preliminary tentative thoughts. I just want to make clear that ad hominen atacks directed at Wolfram's inflated ego or business mentality should not distract us from the merit of his ideas. <br />Stephen Wolfram wants to call our attention to the computational structure of the universe. This is an interesting idea, one that may have the merit in engaging darwinists, intelligent design theorists and even creationists in the discussion. In my view there should be a place for an open, transparent and cordial interchange between all these lines of thought, instead of the academia power games that we see taking place. All these theories and models have scientific merit and scientific weaknessess. Creationism may have its flaws, but so has darwinism. <br />In fact, Wolfram is very hard on darwinism, since it denies that natural selection can account for the complexity we see in the universe. This cepticism he shares with creationists and intelligent design theorists. <br />This only goes to show that many of the criticisms that have been directing against evolution by creationists and intelligent design theorists have a clear scientific basis, and cannot be dismissed as just a mere by product of ideological bias. I know many darwinians wish that could be the case, but it simply isn't. <br />But then Stephen Wolfram rescues evolution and denies creationism and intelligent design by stating that evolution results from simple program rules that generated the complexity we see in the universe, in the course of some billion years. <br />This move allows evolution to survive the criticismm directed at it by creationists on the basis of the gaps in the fossil record and the insufficiencies of random mutations and natural selection. Gradualism and stasis, already much depleted by decades of academicerosion, suffer a strong blow if Wolfram's notions prove right. Howhever, according to Stephen Wolfram, darwinism may be dead, but evolutionary theory is alive and well. <br />There are doubts, however, as to if simple rules can really account for more than \\"complex but not specified information\\" and if this kind of information can account for biological mechanisms such as the human brain or the \\"flagellum bacterianum\\". <br />In fact, intelligent design doesn't deny that simple rules can generate complexity. It just claims that complex specified information and irreducible complexity cannot be purchased without intelligence. There are no free lunches here (William Dembski). <br />Creationism will always try to capitalize on the intelligent design criticism of both darwinism and Wolfram's simple rules for a complex world and computational equivalence. It will reinforce its criticism of darwinism, now stronger than ever, and explore other fields such as flood geology, electromagnetic decay, white hole cosmology, flawed assumptions in radiometric dating, etc., in order to advance its theoretical model. <br />In spite of including the notion of a God creator, something that should not be dismiss a priori, creationism should be considered as scientific as quantum mechanics, possible universes theories, inflated cosmologies, big bang theories, black hole universes, etc., All this theories, includind creationism, try to make sense of empirical data and make predictions about the universe, although none of them can claim any direct evidence on its favour.   <br />In my view there should be ample room for a fruitful discussion of all these issues in the academia, with careful \\"disclosure requirements\\" concerning hidden assumptions. Creationism, for instance, has never hidden its own assumptions. However it is now clear that darwinism has been capitalizing on hidden naturalistic assumptions that are metaphysical in nature, not scientific, not to say that they are question begging.  <br />We need not just a new kind of science, but also a new kind of scientific debate.	2002-07-02

It only takes intelligence to sink darwinism. Why is that so? It pretty simple. If you survey darwinist literature you will find a simple truth: no one has ever seen evolution taking place! <br />1) No one knows how a unicelular organism could lead to the tree of common descent. No one can tell the full story or reconstruct the whole process. <br />2) What's more, evolutionary algorithms are simply incapable of accounting for the complexity of life. The probabilities involved in the origin and evolution of life are beyond our wildest dreams.<br />3) Most \\"proofs\\" of evolution are based on unlikely and untestable extrapolations. <br />4) Many arguments demonstrating evolution assume it took place in the first place. They are (no so clever) tautologies. In fact, it is hard to find an argument in favor of evolution that is not question begging. <br />5) The whole project of evolutionary theory starts from naturalist and materialist assumptions that are themselves question begging. <br />6) This leads to a \\"naturalistic circle\\" in which naturalistic arguments and naturalistic methodology lead necessarily to naturalistic conclusions.   <br />7) The problem with the \\"naturalistic circle\\" is that it assumes a materialistic conception of nature. This, in itself, is also question begging and may mean that the many gaps in evolutionary knowledge may be a structural and objective problem, and not merely a conjunctural and subjective one. <br />8) Information may be a part of nature. This possibility must be investigated before being discarded with tipical \\"darwinian question begging certainty\\". <br />8) William Dembski suggests that scientists should have a method of detecting and measuring design before jumping into the conclusion,as does Richard Dawkins, that \\"evidence demonstrates the existence of a universe without design\\". <br />9) Scientists can only say that there is no design in nature after havingdevised a reliable method to detect and measuring information design and after having tested it in nature with negative results. <br />10)If they don't do this, they will be question begging as they usually do. They may even discard William Dembski's explanatory filter (though I doutbt they will entirely succed)but they cannot discard William Dembski's main argument.	2002-06-24

Darwinian weapons of random mutations and natural selection or even stasis and punctuated equilibrium have led us not to a meaningless, pointless and purposeless universe, as darwinians enjoy saying (as if they had discovered the wheel) but to a meaningless, pointless and purposeless scientifc paradigm, unable to deal with the \\"complex specified information\\" in nature (William Dembski), the \\"irreducible complexity\\" of biological systems (Michael Behe) and the \\"computational structure\\" of the universe (Stephen Wolfram). What's more, darwinism never really got to refute biblical creationism (contrary to what the vast majority of uniformed people think) as it has been proposed and defended by Douhane Gish and John and Henry Morris or R. Humphreys. You may be surprised if I am saying this. But is is just plain fact. Darwinism never refuted creationism. It just assumed that creation never took place, which is something very different than a true and convincing refutation. All the darwinian arguments about evolution assume it existed, rather than demonstrate it existed. They are circular arguments that only convince the already convinced. This means that, as Donald Rumsfeld is reforming the Pentagon and getting it ready to fight new wars, so there should be a profound reform in the realm of scientific paradigms. I am convinced that the future \\"scientific wars\\" will be about information, intelligence and even creation. Intelligent design theorists and even biblical creationists seem to me more prepared in the long run to fight the new scientific wars ahead of us than darwinism. This outdated paradigm looks more and more like a kind of \\"cold war relic\\".	2002-06-17

Morris, H. Morris, among many others, have been stating that darwinist's reliance on random mutations and natural selection to explain the irreducible complexity and complex specified information of biological life, as well as the fine tuning of the universe, was both naive and ill founded. <br />They have been called flat-earthers, laughed at, trashed around... but never refuted. It is much easier to laugh at something than to engage in serious discussion. Although some times justified, laughter is often abused by those who lack  arguments.  <br />Recently, intelligent design theorists like William Dembski, Charles Taxton, Guillermo Gonzalez, Michael Behe, along with the  powerful tribune Phillip Johnson, have launched a potent assault on darwinist bastions, making them retreat to a more defensive, if somewhat surprised, position. Things have never been the dame. Laughter turned a bit shallow and yellow here. <br />The devastating blow came this month with the publication of Sephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science. May 14, the date of the publication of the book, will certainly be the scientific equivalent of September 11 for many scientific theories. Darwinism is a case in point. <br />Wolfram is quite clear in pointing out that  the universe is much more than matter, random mutations and natural selection. It is all &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;software&quot;, information&quot;. Antecipating the the counter arguments of darwinists, Wolfram directs deadly theoretical blows at men like Seven Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins and presents real natural-world evidence of his point. Ernst Mayr is also a victim of collateral damage. Suddenly, darwinists laughter stopped. <br />Creationists and intelligent design theorists had a case, after all, whenever they pointed out that information and intelligent design is a structural component of nature, not a supernatural &quot;free rider&quot; imposed on nature by religionists. Now their case is helped not by a &quot;fundamentalist bible literalist&quot;, but by one true mathematical and computational genious of the calibre of Newton or Einstein. <br />In all this, darwinits &quot;towers of speculation based on speculation&quot; reminds me of the &quot;URSS communist empire&quot; and of Saddan Hussein's army in the Golf War. Both turned out to be much less powerful than expected. Darwinism is simply a big big mistake. <br />Why do you think that creationists are more confident than ever 160 years after Darwin? The earth is not flat, they know that. But evolution is flatly wrong. They also know that. Contrary to darwinists modes of thought and inference, a round earth doesn't lead necessarily to the truth of darwinism. That is clear by know.<br />All things considered, it seems that we will be hearing from creationists very often in the future.	2002-05-20

Stasis is defending evolution when there is really no evidence of evolution. Since gradualism cannot be defended both from genetics and the fossil record, stasis is the alternative theory. <br />The problem is that stasis means that there was really no evolution. Punctuated equilibrium, in the absence of any genetic relevant evidence thereof, is really to be understood as nothing more than another example of argumetative acrobatics evolutionary theorists have become experts in. The problem is that this rethorical devices can only convice the already convinced, because they are powerless apart evolutionary assumptions one must adhere in the first place. I<br /> think intelligent design and even biblican creationism will soon have to displace the darwinian mumbo-jumbo, since not even a book with 1500 pages is able to offer any decisive evidence of evolution that can prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The problem is that, evolution, if it occured at all, cannot be proven by means of eny direct evidence. One can only gather circunstantial evidence and make some extrapolations. <br />The fact is that biblical creationism, far from being deaqd or asleep since the Kansas Monkey trials, has been doing its homework and building a strong case against darwinism. Lately it even got some support from the new influent intelligent design movement. Actually, many of the recent scientific discoveries seem to make biblical creationism more plausible. <br />Darwinism, on the contrary, developed into the darwinian wars between people like Gould and Dawkins, being unable to come up with compelling evidence. It only has a fossil record that is worse than a swiss cheese, along with some evidence of micro evolution inside species and some evidence of similarities in structure between phyla, both of which, far from being strong evidence of common descent, can be better interpreted and explained as evidence of common intelligent design. Darwinism is today in a worst shape than it was in the time of Darwin. <br />Will the emergent intelligent design paradigm stiffle scientific inquiry through the &quot;God of the gaps&quot; syndrome? No way. Only if one is dealing with incompetent scientists. On the contrary, competent scientists will look for function and purpose in nature, something that far from delaying scientific discoveries will even enhance them when one is dealing with so-called vestigial organs or junk DNA. <br />For competent scientists, science will be a kind of &quot;reverse engineering&quot;, &quot;thinking God´s thoughts after God himself&quot; (Newton, Kepler). Incompetent scientists whould be satisfied even with a &quot;chance of the gaps&quot; answer anyway. <br />Intelligent design can be make science possible, plausible and meaningful, because it is premised on the ability of objective nature to be subjectively grasped by intelligent human beings, through the gathering and processing of the information it contains, something that cannot be reduced to matter. <br />Nature is not just about matter, random mutations and natural selection, but about matter and information. Information is the way the intelligent designer (whoever it is) creates irreducible complexity, mathematical structure and fine-tuning in nature's systems. Far from threatning scientific research, intelligent design opens totally new avenues that can keep the scientific community busy for many millenia to come.<br />Intelligent design can also further some progress in other fields of inquiry, such as theology, antropology, philosophy, las, political science, archeology, geology, and so on. Who is afraid of intelligent design. All those whi have high social, ethical, ppolitical and cultural stakes in the prevailing  &quot;meaningless, pointless and purposeless&quot; view of the universe and of Man.	2002-05-06

Here, dissent was possible in the boundaries of catholic dogma alone. Protestant and evangelical dissenters were heretics thast should be silenced and burned. <br />Now, dissent is possible in the boundaries of darwinian dogma alone. Darwin is the secular equivalent of the catholic pope. Creationists and proponents of intelligent designers are \\"stupid, wicked and pervert\\" (Dawkins), and should be excluded from the academia. <br />The fact is that, as marxism passed away, after Marx, as freudianism passed away, after Freud, so darwinism will pass away after Darwin. When science is built only upon thinking men's thoughts after men themselves, it will lead to a meaningless, pointless and purposeless universe. <br />Science will keep being a progressive and meaningful field only if it is willing to \\"think God's thoughts after God Himself\\". (Kepler, Newton). <br />Dawkins and Gould, refute each other, cancel each other's arguments. Both of them are \\"non sequitur\\". It is the classical fossils v. molecules debate. Gould says (used to say) that gradualism is incompatible with the fossil record. At the same time, Dawkins says that saltationism is impossible, from the perspective of molecular biology. <BR>Neither of them can prove evolution without assuming it existed in the first place. Both of them are captive of their own circular reasoning. Actually, both of them are right: gradualism and saltationism are impossible.  <br />Neither of them can have a convincing response to the gaps of the fossil record, the lack of evidence of transpecific macroevolution, the cambrian explosion, the hundreds of highly fine tuned biological, ecological, astrophysical antropic coincidences, irreducible complexity in molecular life, the orignis of life and the formation of DNA, the compatibility of evolution with the second law of thermodinamics(valid also in biological and open systems), the morality and religiosity of Mankind, etc., etc. <br />Dawkins and Gould believe the evidence to prove evolution because they interprete the evidence in the light of evolutionary assumptions. An example: <br />1. Evolutionary assumptions explain the fossil record. <br />2. The fossil record, interpreted in the light of evolutionary assumptions, demonstrates the existence of the geological ages. <br />3. The existence of the geological ages, interpreted in the light of the fossil record as interpreted in the ligh of evolutionary assumptions, proves the validity of evolutionary assumptions.<br />This kind of reasoning, that convinces only the previously convinced or the unintelligent, is everpresent in \\"scientific\\" evolutionism. Actually, it is its raw material. <br />The truth is that in all the above mentioned subjects, evolutionary theory has proved incapable of any scientific discourse that sustains itself apart from previously hidden naturalistic and evolutionary assumptions that need to be proved in the first place. I know not of one argument that is really cogent. <br />If you remove evolutionary assumptions from evolutionary theory and stick to the evidence itself, you will find yourself with nothing in your hands. <br />You will get only the meaningless, pointless and purposeless debate between men like Gould and Dawkins. They are clever, but they are only men. How can they pretend to prove the universal negative that God doesn't exist without rendering themselves as ridiculous and even stupid? <br />It is time that intelligent design and biblical creationism step in to this \\"dead end debate\\" and give it some intelligence, purpose and meaning.	2002-04-22

I agree with Kung when he says that the essence of christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. <br />I find Jesus Christ liberating, and I take his death and bodily ressuraction seriously. I take seriously His message of eternal love and redemption from sin. I take seriously His revelation. I look at Jesus for salvation. I see Jesus as the only Lawyer I, as a sinner, can count on, when I will be before the throne of the absolutely Holy and Just God. He has payed the price of my sins, through his death and ressurrection. Both historical and material facts. <br />Unfortunately, here I have to notice that Hans Kung hardly speaks about the Jesus Christ of the Gospel. For Kung, Jesus is more like a special man, who dared to live and die for his own convictions, not for us. He is the authentic and non alienated man of the german existentialists. For Kung Jesus seems to be, most of all, an example of faith and life, and not really the Way, the Truth and the Life. Kung seems at times to be too much influenced by theologians like Graaf, Welhausen and Bultmann, who used science to demythologize the Bible, instead of using the Bible to demythologize science. Man's fallible word is given more weight than God's infallible Word. This has severely damaged Hans Kung's christianity. <br />The fact is that in Jesus we have the strength to challenge the Popes and the Emperors of this world, along with dominant materialist, naturalistic and evolutionary ideologies and \\"scientific\\" paradigms. Because he rests more in german philosophy and theology than in the Bible, Hans Kung obliterates some of the essential parts of the christian message. <br />We also find in Jesus Christ the strenght to fight against the churches of this world. As John Locke, I believe that a church should be a free and voluntary society constituted by free and equal believers. An authoritarian church is not a christian church. <br />The church should be composed only by baptized believers. The christian faith should be one in which confession of Jesus as saviour should be followed by obedience to Jesus as Lord. This should apllly in the political,legal, economic, social, cultural, and academic spheres of life. A pure institutional, sacramental or national church is at odds with the ecclesiae from the New Testament. <br />Free and equal believers in the church make good free and equal citizens (John Rawls) in the political community. They will know to promote their views in society not through coercion but by means of legitimate persuasion, always respecting the equal rights of non christian and non-religious. <br />Each christian has different gifts, talents and functions, but is endowed with the same privileges and responsabilities. I think this is the only church compatible with the essence of christianity. <br />In my view, while very critical, Hans Kung still expects to much from hierarquical and authoritarian christianity. I think the only true hope for the future is in a decentralized, non-hierarquical, all transparent, truly democratic and free church system. <br />A structure and culture of cover-up and secrecy, even when serious crimes are being commited, is not christian. <br />A democratic and transparent church can help building a democratic and transparent society. <br />I doubt Hans Kung will be able to come up with something really new here. For a reformer, he remains too catholic.	2002-04-15

When I read the pages when Steven Jay Gould elaborates on the influence of Adam Smith on Charles Darwin, I knew one could either laugh or cry at this piece of dramedy (drama and comedy). This analitical move may be suggesting the emergence of a completly new research program of evolutionary economics, or a new naturalistic faith where Darwin is the Pope and Adam Smith is the Emperor, each with his one analitical sword. With the inspiration of names like Cose, Galbraith, Posner, Buchanan, Friedman, Calabrasy, Sen, etc. we will have evolutionary theories about the economic gene, natural selection in a zero transaction costs environment, the the rationality of non market behavior in nature, the economics of evolution, overcoming biology, random mutations and rational expectations of the selfish genes, free to evolve, evolution as freedom, the afluent Galapagos, etc. With this kind of theorizing I have no doubt that the only way evolution, like Enron, has fared so well is because it has been able to deceive its own customers and investors, as Jonathan Wells has demonstrated in his Icons of Evolution, hiding its own losses (v.g. fossil record) behind a chance of the gaps theory and engaging in some shredding of evidence. In fact, if Darwin read Adam Semith, Steven Jay Gould works for Arthur Anderson. Darwin may have indeed misread Smith. That's a whole different story. Adam Smith didn't write only about economics but also about morality, where he tried to develop the project of inquiring about individual moral liberty and responsability started on the basis of dutch protestant arminian theologian and international legal scholar Hugo Grotius and english rationalist moral philosopher David Hume. The framework where economics should work was highly moral, even if realistically taking in to account human moral failures. Market economy was devised by Adam Smith not as a strategy to protect the more powerful, but as a way to liberate common people from the the opressive sedimentary layers or feudal and mercantilist economy, where the powerful clergy, nobility and monarch carried the day. Adam Smith Inquiry on the Nature and Causes on the Wealth of Nations is a powerful statement on individual liberty and responsability and the human ability to intelligently design social institutions and devise fair terms of cooperation. Adam Smith could be highly suspicious about the predatory mentality of the rich and powerful and was an advocate of anti-trust legislation. Maybe darwinians should indeed read Adam Smith and stop claiming de jure state protection for the monopoly position that their own research paradigm enjoys. Adam Smith would certainly favour free and fair competition between  darwinism, creationism and intelligent design. Actually, the present situation sometimes reminds me of the medieval thomistic university understanding of \\"limited dissent\\", where dissent was only permited in the boundaries of absolute truth as proclaimed by the Pope. The darwinian version of the notion of \\"limited dissent\\" is: as long as you accept the infalible character of the basic tenets of Darwin, you can dissent. Only darwinian wars are permited. If you deny darwinian tenets you have no right to exist. Darwinians should also read John Milton's Areopagitica.	2002-04-09

One of them is pragmatist Richard Rorty. Rorty takes seriously the idea that we live in a pointless and meaningless world, where there is no good and evil. In his Truth and Progress, Rorty always building on the authority of Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett keeps saying that the only criteria to test a given proposition is its usefulness, not its truth. We never exactly understand the standards by which he measures usefulness, or from whose point of view. Just imagine Adolf Hitler reasoning: \\"is the proposition that we need to respect the human dignity of the Jews useful?\\". Rorty himself endeavors to test the \\"truth\\" of his own pragmatist propositions by dealing with the Holocaust. His \\"insightful\\" conclusion: since there is no good and evil in a meaningless universe, we cannot say that the Holocaust is inherently evil, we just can say that the triumphant liberal ideas made it look evil. If Hitler had won the war, Rorty would certainly be saying that human rights are evil. This is certainly the \\"universal acid\\" Daniel Dennett keeps talking about. It is \\"Darwin's dangerous idea\\" in action. It is also very stupid an nonsense. Do we need a better example of blind leading blind?	2002-03-06

What is interesting to notice is that evolutionists don't really have hard evidence on that alleged fact. So what do they really have? Like their creationist counterparts, they have a pre-given \\"big picture\\" of what may have happened, and then they have several pieces of a puzzle that they try to put together in a way that somehow fits in that big picture. More than scientifically, we should understand this big picture as a metaphysical construction, with a strong philosophical and ideological component. It was largely the byproduct of a cultural reaction against irrational, arrogant and authoritarian religion, largely supported by State power and supportive of State power, something that characterised the intellectual life of XIX century Europe and, to a small degree, the United States.  As far as that goes, I totally understand their point. <BR>I just don't understand their allegiance to a naturalistic, \\"designless\\", purposeless, pointless, \\"moraless\\" universe, when it is, even now, much to soon to conclude that it is in fact the case. One has to realize that Charles Darwin never really saw macroevolution. Nor has Richard Dawkins for that matter, except in a very limited form. He never really saw conclusive fossil evidence of common descent, nor of the climbing of mout improbable. Motivated by his anti-religious bias, Darwin just picked some evidence of microevolution and constructed a theory supportive of his own emotionally and culturally conditioned worldview. The materialistic mood of the 19th century, largely derived from other frustrated anti-christian and anti-religious men like Feuerbach, Comte, Marx, Engels, and so on, was particularly favorable to his theory.  That's how the ball started rolling in the first place. To keep it rolling the reasoning is entirely circular. First, evolutionary theory  picks up some pieces of a puzzle and infers a naturalistic materialistic big  picture from it. Then it uses the naturalistic picture this infered to try to deduce ways to arrange the other pieces of the puzzle.	2002-03-06

But all the evidence of common descent can also be used, even more successfully, to demonstrate a common designer. It is far from true the statement made by the American NCSE, that \\"similarities and differences among living things on Earth over time and space display a pattern that is best explained by evolutionary theory\\". But even if the NCSE statement was true today, that isn't reason enough to prevent the development of new research programs that in the future may prove superior to evolutionary theory. Intelligent design is one of such paradigms. To say the contrary is to favour the retarding of scientific progress in the name of  \\"unscientific protectionism\\" of prevailing academic vested interests and dogmas. For instance, the fact that broadcasters and most of the audience are content at some point with analogue terrestrial television should not prevent the development of cable or digital TV, although we know that even here \\"the powers that are\\" often try to prevent the emergence of new competitors thus retarding structural and technological innovation. We must notice that, as Jonathan Wells puts it, \\"the claim that evolution is a fact, like the claim that humans evolved from ape-like ancestors, owes more to materialistic philosophy than to empirical science\\". According to this Berkeley Professor, \\"Homology (defined by modern Darwinists as similarity due to common ancestry) is not evidence of common ancestry\\". Well remarks that \\"At the level of the animal phyla, common ancestry is not inferred from \\"sources of information\\" such as fossils, molecules or embryos; instead, it is assumed on theoretical grounds.\\" In this light, homology can be plausibly interpreted as an evidence of a common designer, of different aplications of the same basic \\"life-operating-system\\" produced by an intelligent agent. As far as Windows, Word, WordPerfct, Excel, Power Point, Netscape, etc, are concerned, homology is not a sign of common descent but of a common designer. Although some \\"bugs\\" actually appear here and there, they cannot be used to deny intelligent design.  They must be explained without denying intelligent design. I don't see why it can't be any different in biology. Nothing, apart from naturalistic bias, determines that the common designer hypothesis should be ruled out in advance. On one hand, common descent is far from proven beyond reasonable doubt. In fact, it is even doubtful that one can come up with a \\"preponderance of evidence\\" case for common descent without a little help from a piori naturalistic assumptions. Microevolution is not macroevolution, and macroevolution in a limited scale is not the same thing as macroevolution at a large scale. On the other hand, mathmatics, information, design and complexity theories all point to the empirical possibility of detecting and measuring intelligent design in nature.	2002-03-06

In his own words, \\"the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.\\" On the contrary, Charles Taxton observes that \\"Molecular biology has now uncovered an analogy between DNA and written human languages. It is more than an analogy, in fact: in terms of structure, the two are \\"mathematically identical.\\" Werner Gitt, Michael Behe, William Dembski and Lee Spetner, just to quot a few, have demonstrated that information is a structural part of nature, without which we cannot take in to account all its properties and possibilities. Mutation and natural selection are just not enough. According to William Dembski \\"... chance and necessity have proven insufficient to account for all scientific phenomena. Without invoking the rightly discarded teleologies, entelechies, and vitalisms of the past, one can still see that a third mode of explanation is required, namely, intelligent design. Chance, necessity, and design-these three modes of explanation-are needed to explain the full range of scientific phenomena.\\" Information is a sign of intelligence that can be detected and measured. So the existence of an intelligent design can be postulated and discussed scientifically, not just theologically or philosophycally. So there is nothing unscientific about denying design its scientific status. On the contrary, it is simply arbitrary and plain wrong not to do it, considering all that is at stake. Richard Dawkins likes to take pride on his \\"intellectually fulfilling atheism\\". But I would caution him against what really has become a form of \\"intellectually fulfilling autism\\"	2002-03-06

The problem is that Dawkins keeps wearing those outdated naturalistic positivistic and antimetaphysical XIX century glasses that distort his vision, if not make him totally blind. Dawkins is the blind mythmaker. It makes a big difference the kind of glasses you are wearing, as the soldiers with \\"night vision glasses\\" know all too well. When one arbitrarily reduces the empirical observation and testing field of analisis by sticking to naturalistic assumptions, one necessarily comes to naturalistic conclusions. The problem is that evolutionary theory transforms itself in secular religion, or, we could say, as a kind of \\"darwinistic civil religion\\". This was recognized by Michael Ruse, when he said that \\"in the past, and I think also in the present, for many evolutionists, evolution has functioned as something with elements which are, let us say, akin to being a secular religion ... And it seems to me very clear that at some very basic level, evolution as a scientific theory makes a commitment to a kind of naturalism, namely, that at some level one is going to exclude miracles and these sorts of things come what may.\\" And as a religion, evolutionary theory can get pretty intolerant. In a tipical inquisitorial tone, Richard Dawkins says that to deny the central thesis of Darwinism, namely common descent through selection and modification, one has to be either stupid or wicked or insane. That's Dawkins equivalent of \\"heretic, scismatic or apostate\\". As William Dembski notices, \\"This metaphysic is so pervasive and powerful that it not only rules alternative views out of court, but it cannot even permit itself to be criticized. The fallibilism and tentativeness that are supposed to be part and parcel of science find no place in the naturalistic metaphysic that undergirds Darwinism.\\"	2002-03-06

If Dawkins' statement is scientific it should be falsifiable. If that is in fact the case, then it is scientific to try to falsify it, and one has to conclude that the intelligent design movement is scientific, because it tries to refute a scientific claim. If it insn't, then what authority has Dawkins to criticise the intelligent design movement, when he himself is putting forward uncientific claims disguised as science? If Dawkins can do that, why can't the intelligent design movement or even creation science? I think the best account of origins and life should be one that provides a compreensive, coherent and consistent explanation not just of the data we derive from biology, paleontology, archeology, micro and macro physics or cosmology but also from history, phsycology, philosophy, theology, mathematics, design, complexity and information theory, as well as from our moral, spiritual and emotional experiences, intuitions and feelings. The purpose of a scientific theory is really to make sense and provide meaning to all there is, a paradox that must be somehow faced and solved by those for whom there is no sense and no meaning. <BR>There is another interesting paradox. Evolutionary theory affirms design while trying to deny it, since it hasn't been able to do away with tipical designer language. This point has recently been made by Don Cruse. Evolutionary theory books are full of words and expressions like \\"design\\", \\"designless design\\", \\"designoid\\", \\"watchmaker\\", \\"selection\\", \\"advantage\\", \\"system\\", \\"repair system\\", \\"program\\", \\"reprogram\\", \\"adaptation\\", \\"structure\\", \\"organization\\", \\"pattern\\", \\"mechanism\\", \\"complexity\\", \\"process\\", \\"critical component\\", \\"law\\", \\"code\\", \\"translation\\", \\"transcription\\", \\"sequencing\\", \\"function\\", \\"quorum sensing\\", etc., etc., etc. These words and expressions, even when allegedly used metaphorically (although most of the times they apply literally), are more than enough, given their abundant use in evolutionary theory, to betray the point that even while stubornly denying all evidence of information and intelligent design in nature, the best way to describe it is still by means of using inherently rational and functional \\"engineering\\" language. What's more, we see ourselves as rational, reasonable and morally free and responsible agents, not as just a bunch of selfish genes doing what comes naturally.  Intelligence stares us in the eye. We see it everywhere, we even \\"speak it\\" all the time, but we are truly unable to know it or comprehend it, beyond our words and expressions. This structural inability of evolutionary theory to generate a consistent vocabulary apart from the words of reason, intelligence and design, may be a sign both of nature's objective resistance to be known apart from the language of intelligence and design, and of our own built-in subjective resistance to an  understanding of our world and our lives that does violence to our, conscious or unconscious, self-understanding as intelligent beings created by and in the image of an intelligent being.  The fact that intelligence and information are a structural part of nature, our nature, and nature's God, may be rendering scientific progress impossible apart from the language of intelligence and design, even when intelligent design is flatly denied. The basic problem seems to lie, not in the inability of nature to  give us signs of intelligence, but in our own inability to make sense of those signs beyond our basic perception of them. This may say something not just about our scientific competence, but about our spiritual condition.	2002-02-25

They say this when it comes to stress the importance of values like truth, honesty and integrity. We could also say the same about \\"loving your neighbor as yourself\\", the core of equality and reciprocity. This book is an example of how you can do much by sticking to simple assumptions. I must say that I appreciate Sunstein and Holmes a lot, and try to read all that thy write. <br />Steven Holmes and Cass Sunstein have made a strong case, in this and their other writings,  that while we can appreciate and defend free enterprise, private property, private media, free exercise of religion, and so on, we still need a strong State to impose liberal constraints on private power. <br />In fact, that's what classical social contract theory is all about. The State is created by a social contract to protect individuals from one another, since the state of nature is a state of war between men, in which man is a wolf to other man. <BR>Historically, the liberal revolutions were fought against not only absolute monarchs, but also against authoritarian churches, catholic and protestant, that used State power as a secular arm (\\"braccio seculare\\") to impose their own dogmas to believers and non believers, thus excercising an undue \\"power over the hearts of man\\" (Baruch Spinoza). <br />While we should advocate a strong marketplace of ideas (including religious ones), and while we should appreciate religion contribution to civic virtues, we still have to protect our liberal institutions from ilegitimate attempts to get these institutions under the control of iliberal and anti-liberal religious dogmas that want to fight equal religious liberty for all citizens and groups alike, believers and non-believers, men and women, adults and children, black and white, gay and straight. That's what separation of religious communities and State is all about.    <br />When we think of Enron, forinstance, we realize that corporations can be a Leviathan to many defenseless citizens, by totally destroying their life savings and prospects, with profound psicological consequences. That's plain evil. More, we realize that some already rich man will evade their duties of citizenship and civility (v.g. the duty of paying taxes) to get even more rich. <br />I am in favor of a strong market economy. It allows for human creativity, it creates wealth, it creates habits of work, trust and tolerance, it decentralizes authority, and by doing this it can further human rights.   <br />But I think that only a robust liberal State, with strong legislative, administrative and judicial branches, can counter the threat to liberty, security and well being that some corporations here and there may represent. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as Lord Acton said. Only a strong liberal State can make, market economy both possible and credible. <br />Originally liberals are defenders of the State, an institution tipical of a civilized society. John Locke is the main example here. The liberal State is a mark of rationalization  and civilization, as german philosopher G.F. Hegel would put it. That's why Oliver Wendell Holmes used to say that taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society. I totally agree with that. Liberal thought fears both authoritarian states, weak states or anarchy. In all these situations the strongest will prevail at the expense of the weak. <br />Of course much needs to be done to better the State, to make it more just, transparent and efficient. A lot can be done, if there is the political will to do this. One of the reasons why state reform is so difficult has to do with the way private interests, lobbies, and naked preferences take the dominance and try to use the monopoly of legitimate coercion to further their own ends. That's why a civic republican liberalism is so important when it comes to reform the State. <br />I think there is plenty of room for a strong and commited \\"intelligent design movement\\" in politics and institution building that is able to come up with liberating public institutions that support a liberating private sphere. <br />But one thing is certain: evading the cost of rights will, in the end, be evading their benefits too. Sunstein and Holmes... we got it.	2002-02-05

Basically, I try to read everything he writes. Although here and there I would have a slightly different opinion (v.g. in free speech matters I tend to have a broader view of this fundamental right) Sunstein's books are always insightful, refreshing and profound. He has deeply influenced my view on constitutional issues.  <br />Cass Sunstein (in the line of Stephen Holmes, another author whom I also appreciate, combines progressive liberalism with classical liberalism, showing that liberal institutions, in a proper sense, have to be strong institutions, or else they will cease to be liberal. <br />Another lesson we learn from Sunstein is about the value of democratic deliberation, based on reason and principle, and not in a social darwinism or \\"dawkinism\\" made of ideas such as \\"survival of the fittest\\", \\"natural selection\\", \\"naked preferences\\", \\"private power\\" or, less theoretically, \\"the law of the jungle\\". Sunstein's work is about escaping the \\"state of nature\\". It is basically against any kind of naturalistic reduction. <br />This emphasis allows us to build democratic institutions that prevail over the markets and control all abuses of market power (including civil and social rights violations), while still apreciating the value of private property, free enterprise and the market, as ways of strenghning autonomy, producing wealth and decentralizing power. <br />Sunstein also provides us critical tools to evaluate the way past injustices and patterns of subordination distort de baselines on which we build our judgements on liberty and equality, in a way that can provide a foundation of social and <BR>legal reform while keeping important liberal principles. He is able to integrate the insights of the critical schools of legal thought, while preserving a strong liberal commitment. In this way he keeps company with authors like Rawls, Dworkin, Habermas, Scanlon, Barry, Rosenfeld, etc., <br />Consciously or not, Sunstein's books, including this one, are  premissed in a sense of human dignity as a intelligent, rational and moral being, that largely transcends its consideration as an purely accidental configuration of selfish genes, resulting from matter, random mutations and natural selection. <br />Human beings are seen as capable of intelligently designing democratic institutions based on discourse, dialogue, deliberation, reason and principle, much in the same line of the \\"intelligent design movement\\" (William Dembski, Michael Behe, Guilermo Gonzalez). Sunstein's is a \\"Republic of Reasons\\", not a \\"republic of selfish genes\\". However, Sunstein's work is not about bringuing teleology, or the good, but about the priority of right, and the belief of the creating,  liberating and open ended ability of human beings to transcend past \\"teleologies\\" and give themselves more free and just institutions for the future.	2002-01-31

Richard Rorty's agenda is about deconstructing the judeo-christian civilization. This desire he shares with men like Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Jacques Derrida and... Ussama Ben Laden! Of course there are some differences between them.  The last one resorts to more explosive and deadly arguments. <br />Still all of them have a low understanding of human nature and human dignity and need to be &quot;smoked out and brought to justice&quot;, even if in a purely figurative sense (except for Ben Laden). <br />I understand some of the political concerns of Rorty. He cares about establishing an open liberal society with liberty and justice for all, and I care about that too. But Rorty doesn't want it to be under God. No way. For him, there is no God, there is no God's eye perspective, there is no absolute truth, there is no fact of the matter. I guess Richard Rorty knows it because he has been there and done that! <br />I want to build such a society, too, but I think it has more to do with the Enlightment Project (in a true sense) than with Rorty sofistic mistifications. I think human reason still plays an important role in this project, if we consider its absolute foundations. <br />Questions that deal with the meaning and purpose of our lives are too important to be arbitrarily subjected to a naturalistic reduction (just because men like Rorty, Dawkins, or Dennett say so), or to be solved with pragmatic considerations, without any regard for the truth of the matter.  <br />Of course Rorty gives the example in the project of building a true society. If some mad driver calls him &quot;animal!&quot;, he returns the compliment in a very nice, polite and tolerant way, because that's the way he actually sees himself: an animal, totally an animal and nothing more than an animal. I guess that is the pragmatic equivalent of the sermon of the mount. This may sound harsh, but it corresponds entirely to the fact of the matter as Rorty sees it. In my view Rorty thinks too lowof himself. <br />I believe that a free, fair, tolerant and democratic society can and should be based on a broad and inclusive sense of human dignity and a principle of equal concern and respect (Dworkin)(in the line of Rawls' &quot;overlapping consensus&quot;, Sunstein's &quot;incompletely theorized agreements&quot; or Rosenfeld's &quot;compreensive pluralism&quot;), which is perfectly compatible with faith in God and the observance of the Golden Rule (principle, not rule), without requiring any sort of &quot;evolutionary regression&quot; to the level of the &quot;beasts in the field&quot;. <br />If we consider that the more politically stable, economically prosperous, scientifically advanced and rights-based societies are those that were more influenced by the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightment, we have some food for thought about society building. On the other end, atheist societies have the poorest marks on all these items. <br />Rorty's self-representation he borrows from Darwin, whom he takes seriously. Darwin and his acolite Richard Dawkins have a strong (although not scientifically warranted) belief that Man (in an improper sense) is the mere byproduct of matter, random mutations and natural selection. Man is just a bunch of selfish genes doing what comes naturally. <br />There is no reason, no self and no reality beyond thought. Rorty's problem is that according to this view, there is no thought either. Thoughts are just a casual byproduct of subatomic particles in motion, whom we have no reason watsoever to trust. In the end, all philosophical  inquiries have to deal with subatomic particles. <br />Rorty tries to take his atheistic assumptions to the last consequences, but he doesn't take his naturalistic reduction to the end. He stops short of admitting the futility of his own project. Rorty talks about himself, even as a special animal, as if there is such a thing called Rorty. He still seems to believe in the existence of a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;. <br />But if we take neodarwinism seriously (which we shouldn't), Rorty doesn't exist, and his thoughts are nothing but particles in random motion. Since everything is matter, nothing matters at all. <br />Of course we now know better than that. Biology, microphysics,  and astrophysics all talk about the irreducible complexity of life, matter, and the cosmos. Just search Amazon.com for authors like William Dembski, Michael Behe, Phillip Johnson, Charles Taxton, Guillermo Gonzalez. <br />Intelligence and information are a structural part of reality, along with matter, mutations and selection. Information is now empirically detectable and measurable, thanks to information, complexity, design and probabilities theories. <br />It is true that microevolution exists, along with some macroevolution. But we are coming to realize that megaevolution is only possible through complex-specified information, a product of external informed intervention in the universe. <br />There is no place for neodarwinian free lunches and just-so stories of the kind Rorty appreciates. Random mutations and natural selection cannot generate the huge amounts of complex-specified information needed to get abiogenesis, DNA and RNA, the irreducible complexity of molecular machines, the fine-tunning of the Universe, etc. <br />That being the fact of the matter, maybe there is some Absolute Reason after all. Maybe there is an intellectual bridge between objective reality and subjective perception, since both of them display signs of intelligent design. <br />In this case, the pursuit of truth still makes sense after all this years, and Richard Rorty's project is nothing more than a nice try by a nice guy. For now, the preponderance of scientific evidence (not theological or philosophical speculation) points to the existence of intelligent design in the Universe &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. <br />Richard Rorty is desperately in need of a kuhnian paradigm shift, or else he risks being himself the object of some form of 21 st century antipositivist carnapian scorn.	2001-12-18

One can say that he is the academic equivalent of Harry Potter. His books too are mostly spiritual, fictional and entertaining, if you love the genre. By itself this would justify the five stars. But there is another good reason why his books should be appreciated. They give us a paradigmatic case study of metaphysical naturalism, that starts with naturalistic assumptions, so as to reach metaphysical conclusions, messing up the real scientific and empirical problems that arise in between. This grand ideological design that lies behind Dawkins work, blinds him in the face of the &quot;watchmaker&quot;. Dawkins is unable to know intelligence when he sees it. The end result is not totally flattering to Dawkins. He has built his academic carreer on both the stupidity principle and to the mediocrity  principle, both of which turn out to show up in most of his work, afecting his modes of thought and inference.

The Stupidity principle leads him  to conclude, when looking at very complex life forms,  that &quot;appearence of design&quot; plus &quot;ultra low probability of random formation&quot; leads undisputably to a &quot;denial of a design inference&quot;.I guess neodarwinism is the only place in the academia where this kind of reasoning makes sense. With this kind of logic, Dawkins would hardly make it as a detective, a forensic expert, an intellectual property lawyer or a SETI researcher. Today we know that life, even at a molecular level, is irreducibly complex (Michael Behe) and dependent on huge amounts of complex-specified information (William Dembski), something that is as natural as matter, and that remains unexplainable by the neodarwinian mechanism of random mutations and natural selection, however specified in advance. Information, something that only intelligent design can generate, is now clearly detectable and measurable both in biological systems (v.g. DNA and the RNA mechanism)and in cosmological antropic coincidences (v.g. the Big Bang, Galaxy Habitable Zones). The Mediocrity principle holds Dawkins captive of a Compernican world view, when many astrophysicians are becoming post-copernican. According to this last post-compernican view, the Earth, far from being a mediocre planet in the middle of countless ones of the same kind, has hiper fine-tuned characteristics and is highly dependent of the hiper fine-tuning of the the sun, the solar system as a whole, our galaxy, and even the universe, a something that, contrary to the copernican view, really makes it unique. The origin of life is not a probable event in any mediocre planet. We know this, not because we are pre-compernican, but because we have overcome the coperican view, also known as the mediocrity principle. All evidence points to the ultra high improbability of life in any place of the universe. Life is dependent on the hihlu improbable combination on microcosmical and macrocosmological variables. So the Earth turns out to be a very special place after all (G.Gonzalez). It seems that the Universe knew we were coming, because all the variables are in the right place. So what should we make of Dawkins? Well, we can consider him a tipical XIX (yes, 19)century late relic, with a positivistic, naturalistic and anti-metaphisical obsessive frame of mind. We sould also notice the odd similarities between Dawkins' agenda (of denial of the existence of God, of the transcendent dignity of mankind, of the metaphysical distinction between good and evil) and the agenda of the Serpent of the Garden of Eden. Both want to strip human existence out of its transcendent meaning. Evolution, for Dawkins, really turns out to mean regression. Everything is matter. So nothing really matters! There is nothing like a spiritual, intellectual, emotional or moral dimension in the human being. There is no intelligent design that connects matter and mindm objective reality and subjective reason. Man is just the casual byproduct of a stupid and mediocre &quot;evolutionary&quot; process of matter, mutations, and selection. Man is made in the image of nature (conveniently  distorted), not in the image if the Creator of nature. Man is just a bunch of selfish genes, and so are his thoughts, his feelings and his quest for meaning and purpose. The problem for Dawkins is that he can explain how and why our &quot;bunch-of-particles-reason&quot; can be trusted as the foundation and measure of all objective knowledge. Dawkins view, while trying to give us a naturalistic way out of Eden, against all evidence to the contrary, ends up confronting us with the same spiritual and moral  questions of Genesis chapters 1 to 3. This shows that the story of Adam and Eve remains spiritually and morally relevant today, as Dawkins proves to us. With Dawkins we are in fact back in to Eden. Dawkins problem is not scientific. It is spiritual.	2001-12-03

If you think you will make significant progress in your knowledge after you have read this book,analize this. The book assumes a XIX century positivist &quot;forma mentis&quot;, that starts from naturalistic assumptions of the worst kind. The main idea underlying the book is that matter, random mutations and natural selection are able to explain all there is. However, this premisse is flawed from the begining, compromizing all of Dawkins effort. What you get in the end is a logical mess that compares to: &quot;All monkeys speak english; Darwin spoke english; so, Darwin was a monkey&quot;. It may sound logical, but it's all dead wrong!. So is the case with The Selfish Gene. As far as fundamental questions are concerned, this book in particular and Richard Dawkins's work generally never really took off. How did nothing &quot;mutate&quot; to become something? What &quot;selected&quot; beeing from non-beeing? How did  matter evolve from non-matter? What was the mechanism? Here, Dawkins is still in ground zero. So, there is nothing but ignorance to support all that follows. That is why Richard Dawkins keeps resorting to &quot;leaps of faith&quot; that would cause Soren Keerkegard to blush. The only plausible stratagy seems to be to extrapolate from micro to macroevolution, and from here to a cosmological evolutionary mechanism, even if all that is done without any conection whatsoever to empirical evidence. Here just-so stories command and control. I think that is all he can get from the mithological &quot;pre-biotic soup&quot;. Besides, the kind of &quot;metaphysical naturalism&quot; that constitutes the &quot;ideological design&quot; behind Richard Dawkins' work, is an outdated form of positivism that has long been proven useless to deal with &quot;origins and nature of life&quot; questions,where all clues, indications, facts and ideas are worthy of investigation because these questions are too important to be subjected to a naturalistic reduction, just because Dawkinssays so (out of his own prejudices). What's  more, Dawkins version of metaphysucal and methodological naturalism begs the question, because it assumes that intelligent design is not a structutural part of nature, along with matter, mutations and natural selection (and this, only at a microlevel, as all evidence seems to suggest). But that remains yet to be seen. It happens that this assumption is getting harder and harder to sustain, in the presence of what we now know about DNA and RNA mechanism, the Cambrian explosion, the irreducible complexity of molecular life (Michael Behe), the fine-tuning of the universe, the conditions for life in our galaxy, etc. From the point of view of design theory, probabilities theory, information theory and complexity theory we have to conclude that information is as natural as matter. To deny this is as nonsensical, from a truly scientific perspective (not just a philosophical one) as to deny that an automobile is much more that its material components. In fact, the intelligent design movement has demonstrated that once we leave behind arbitrarly imposed naturalistic ontological and epistemological constrains, we can detect and measure intelligent design in nature through the category of &quot;complex-specified information&quot; (William Dembski), much beyond reasonable doubt. It also happens that it is a mistake (unworthy of a true homo sapiens) to sustain that our minds are just casual a bunch-of-particles, and then to try to use them as the sole foundation for grand generalizations about the universe, and even this without any strong empirical basis!! This is and can only be hilarious! The fact is that Richard Dawkins has been leaking out here his true &quot;not so scientific&quot; and &quot;not so hidden&quot; agenda: attacking the existence of God, of morality, of the difference between good and evil and of the transcendent nature, meaning and dignity of human life. Notice that he considers the account of the book of Genesisas a fairy tale. While I think that this book is not to be taken litterally as source of a scientific description of events, I can't help noticing the similarities that occur between Dawkins's agenda and the one of the Serpent of the  Garden of Eden. One may say that this is just another sterile coincidence. But it seems to me that we can say here also that there is nothing new under the sun. Be careful, then, even if you don't believe in Adam and Eve, because Dawkins can get you well into their place.	2001-11-19

I read it and enjoyed its several essays. Although I am in no position to review its conclusions on the several domains (critique of naturalism, authority of scripture, virgin birth, the incarnation, design in science, etc), I tend to agree with the main conclusions. I also favour the return of apologetics to theology courses, as long as it is done with intellectual rigour. The entire point of the book seems to be that the premisse you start with really makes a difference on the way you deal with the main tenets of the christian faith. The main alternatives are: <BR> <BR>1. Nobody created Nature. Nature developed intelligent beeings by pure chance (random mutation and natural selection). Our lives have no meaning. Some may try to find meaning for life, some may not. Some my even try to destroy life. Why not? Since there is no meaning, there is also no absolute moral and ethical norms. Madre Teresa and Osama Bin Laden are just a bunch of selfish genes trying to survive. Genocide may be considered a normal and legitimate strategy of gene survival, as Charles Darwin and many evolutionists acknowleged. Who can blame them for that?  Even if it is the result of pure chance, our intelligence is suficiently powerful and reliable to be the measure of all knowledge. You can trust your selfish genes for that. You can also enjoy a free lunch and relax while you listen to a just-so story. <BR> <BR>2. God may have created Nature, and let it develop into intelligent beeings by pure chance. God did not create Man in his image. He simply may have accepted the results of the evolutionary process with fair play. In fact we don't know that. There is no evidence of God whatsoever. If he exists, that's the philosophers and theologians problem. Let them speculate. In the real world (if there is one), objective science sees no place for God and no fingerprints of its presence. Faith is purely subjective and precarious. Knowledge is totally objective and reliable. They never meet in the real world. Here again you can trust your selfish genes for that. Here too, you can enjoy a free lunch while you listen to a just-so story.<br />3. God created man in his image. Subjective reason and objective matter have their own foundation in the Absolute Logos. Both are the product of intelligent design. Probabilities theory, design theory, complexity theory and information theory allow us to make a design inference scientifically beyond reasonable doubt. There is no free lunch here. There are no just-so stories. The complex specified information that structures matter also makes it intelligible and renders both possible and meaningful objective knowledge by our subjective reasons. You can trust the Word that became flesh and lived among us, for that. He is the source of all intelligence, all information, all matter, all life, all love, all freedom. He became flesh so that flesh can know the Word. He did it in a way that respects our freedom to accept or reject. If we accept him and his revelation as the foundation of all truth, instead of trusting our own \\"naturalistic-bunch-of-particles-reason\\", things start making sense. It even promotes the progress of mankind. Remember that all data shows that those countries mostly influenced by the genuinely christian revelation (the Inquisition, or the Index Librorum Prohibitorum have no place in  that), tend enjoy stable democracies, economic progress, human rights protection and the rule of law.  <br />This approach helped the authors of the essays that make this book make sense of problems that are complicated only for naturalism. I advise its reading.	2001-11-07
US	47984649	REHV1RZV6CI0E	019286212X	150521951	The Meme Machine (Popular Science)	Books	5	5	17	N	N	THE LOGOS MACHINE	Richard Dawkins, in spite of is tallent, is a man lost between matter and mind. According to his metaphysical naturalism (typical of XIX century), all thought, all feelings and all emotions are ultimately the product of matter, mutations and selection. There is no self. Those who believe there is, are the modern equivalent of thosdes that used to believe in fairy tales. There is no \\"ghost in the machine\\". But if one takes Dawkins' materialist reductionism to its ultimate logical consequences, there is nothing beyond matter that would warrant the truth of our perceptions. Reason and intelligence have no place inside Dawkins' autopoietic naturalist system. What we designate as mind is just a bunch of particles and genes in a random movement. No one knows exactly where they came from, where they are going, and what they are up to. Where, when and how did nothing \\"mutate\\" to become something? What mechanism \\"selected\\" beeing from non-beeing? Here Richard Dawkins is still in Ground Zero. Matter by itself gets darwinian theories nowhere, because ultimately it undermines our ability to believe there is such thing as a  mind or a reason able to formulate and sustain plausible theories. But what if post-modern idealism is right? What if Dawkins is nothing but a prisoner of his own thought, epistem, paradigm, &quot;set of memes&quot;, unable to connect with \\"reality\\".  <br />What it there is no \\"reality\\" as there is no \\"self\\"? What if the darwinian worldview, with its concepts like \\"matter\\", \\"mutations\\", \\"selection\\", \\"facts\\", \\"evidence\\", etc., is just one more human construct, a product of the &quot;meme machine&quot;, designed to fight an ideological, political, moral and spiritual battle against the once dominant judeo-christian &quot;memes&quot; and paradigms, whith no true connection with what is out there? Again, this line of thought gets evolutionary theories nowhere, because it denies the possibility of connecting to something \\"real\\" beyond mind, thought and words. Both naturalism and idealism lead to a dead end. <BR>In my view, it makes perfect sense to overcome modernist radical naturalism, and post-modernist radical idealism, combining science and religion, without falling in pre-modern superstition. This approach (more XXI century) seems to me more promissing, in a time when some astronomers are beginning to say that only a miracle could have produced the Big Bang, and when all biologists (including Dawkins), keep refering to the DNA code as a literary masterpiece. What's more, the language of intelligence and design is always present in every TV documentary about Nature. This combination could be attained by exploring the possibilities opened by the philosophical and religious concept of The Absolute Logos,  (word; reason; &quot;Logos Machine&quot;), that is beyond nature, and combining it with scientific evidence if intelligence, complex-specified information (William Dembski), irreducible-complexity (Michael Behe), that we now can get from design theory, probabilities theory and complexity theory. This would certainly make more sense than to keep insisting, in a desperate \\"just so\\" mode, and against all appearance and all probabilities, that the DNA code, with its trillions of complex specified instructions, along with the fine-tuning of the universe for life, could have been the result of blind chance. This type of inference, would be unthinkable anywhere else outside neodarwinism. This openess to the Absolute Logos, would make it possible for us understand and sustain scientific inquiry and progress, and to try to know more about our own reason, our intelligence, our sense of morality, our freedom, our failures, our sense of guilt and our responsibilities, that is, to know more ourselves and our place in this world. It would also invite us to try to know more about The Logos that became flesh and lived among us.	2001-10-15

In spite of the fact that all appearance and all probabilities point to the contrary, there is really no sign of intelligence and purpose in the universe. There is no transcendent realm of meaning. If it is true that many darwinists still care about morality, in the end why should they?<BR> <BR>Scientific arguments, from cosmology and biology, that point to a design inference, in the words of William Dembski, even when they have the strongest pedigree from the standpoint of complexity theory, design theory and probabilities theory, are easily dismissed and explained away as prima facie incompatible with the metaphysical naturalistic assumptions that lurk behind neo-Darwinism and evolutionary theory in general. This is so, even if the design inference, besides being scientifically testable, seems to be the only way to make sense of life, death, morality, law, politics, human rights, and so on.<BR> <BR>For evolutionary theory in general, conscience, awareness, mind, feeling, love, hate, good, evil, are all subject to naturalist reduction, even when that is accomplished through conceptual \\"terrorist\\" strategies like \\"just so stories\\", \\"fact-free science\\", \\"naturalism of the gaps\\", \\"wishful thinking\\" and a conveniently distorted understanding of Occam's razor, that comes down to: \\"while we can keep speculating about natural and blind causes for all that is, we will keep ignoring all the evidence of intelligent design, no matter how strongand compelling\\". <BR> <BR>Some of these strategies have been denounced by evolutionary scientists themselves. I am only documenting  them. Information and intelligent design, even if clearly detectable and measurable scientifically, are completely ignored, for the sake of blindness and chance. All the difficult problems, like the big bang, the origin of the prebiotic soup, of life, of the DNA code, of irreducible complexity of molecular machines, the transition from micro to macroevolution, are solved with a single \\"terrorist\\" \\"just son\\" formula, that comes down to:  \\"matter does its best and time does the rest\\". This way, \\"metaphysical naturalism\\" is as scientific as marxist \\"scientific\\" socialism. <br />In my vew, emotions, beliefs, intuitions and pre-understandings can be a part of the scientific process, as long as they are stated clearly and publicly. For instance, although I am not into &quot;scientific creationism&quot; (Gish; Morris, etc), I think it makes more sense and is much more transparent to state clearly that one is trying to prove the truth of the biblical Genesis, than to engage in &quot;scientific naturalism&quot; while at the same time trying to hide the fact that one is trying to prove the truth of pre-given naturalistic assumptions.<br />Douane Gish and Henry Morris, among others, state their case clearly, controversial as their case maybe. On the contrary, Dawkins, Lewontin, Dennett, among others, just leak it out here and there, although Dawkins has recently become more vocal about his deliberate &quot;atheist agenda-setting and reality-framing objectives&quot;. That's why he has recently been severely criticised by evolutionary scholar Michael Ruse, among others, on the grounds that he has been passing out the &quot;trade secret&quot; of evolutionary theory (that is, metaphysical naturalism), thus giving more weight to the arguments of creationists and intelligent design scholars, when they complain that most of current evolutionary theory is nothing more than metaphysical naturalism in disguise, taught in public schools with public moneys, on the basis of state granted epistemological and material privileges.  <BR> <BR>I think that here also a \\"call to war\\" is appropriate. Not a war of violence, intolerance, prejudice and dogmatism, of course, but an intellectual war that preserves the integrity of the scientific method, willing to boldly go where the evidence leads, and that remains epistemically open to other areas of human thought and experience, like theology, philosophy, law and ethics. In this war, intelligence and information (complex specified) play a crucial role. Built-in bias and assumptions may play an important part, and may even be illuminating, as long as they are publicly and fairly assumed and debated.<BR> <BR>In my opinion, the Intelligent Design Movement is the best response to the \\"scientific terrorism\\" of metaphysical naturalism that, in spite of its scientific weaknesses, has held the modern man captive. Isn't it \\"scientific terrorism\\" to teach a naturalistic evolution as if it was  the absolute truth, while using school books with fake and fraudulent drawings, as Jonathan Wells has demonstrated in his \\"Icons of Evolution\\"? Isn't it \\"scientific terrorism\\" not to open the scientific journals to Intelligent Design Movement scholars, and then argue that their work is not peer reviewed? Isn't it \\"scientific terrorism\\" to treat neo-darwinian ortodoxy as a kind of \\"you-can't touch me ideology\\" and then stigmatize all dissidents as \\"creationists\\", the darwinian equivalent of heretic, apostate, cismatic, infidel, etc. ?<BR> <BR>We have to fight metaphysical naturalism and \\"smoke it out\\" of its academic holes and caves and \\"bring it to justice\\" (or take justice to it) as Dr. Phillip Johnson started doing with his brilliant \\"Darwin on Trial\\". The true Enlightment Project is certainly more about connecting with the intelligent design, the Logos, the Word, the Light that shines in the dark,which gives order, intelligibility, meaning and purpose to the universe and our lives, than with connecting with the spiritual forces of blindness, selfishness, chaos and irrationality.	2001-10-11

To do this, I will be provocative, without losing the sense of balance and fairness. Can there be any similarity between Osama Bin Laden and Richard Dawkins? This question may have the appearance of bad taste, but I mean to use it to make my point. Fortunately, there are not many similaritiesin method. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist of the worst kind, that, along with his networks, we have to fight and \\"smoke out\\". His cause is the one of blind irrationality, selfishness, and taking terror to the most improbable hights. Richard Dawkins is a bright intelectual, of the highest ranking, that fights is war not through violence and terror but through the strengh of is excellent writings, as fair play forces us to recognize. I prefer to deal with Richard Dawkins. No doubt about it. However, there are some strange similarities between the two. Please correct me if I am wrong. Both of them fight hard to promote their metaphysical world view that, in spite of their profound differences, ultimately render the concepts of human autonomy and human rights meaningless. Both of them seem to have a profound hatred towards the foundations of the judeo-christian civilization, specially those that point to human transcendent dignity, moral freedom and responsibility, which is something they want so badly to destroy.  These values have been at the origin both of modern science, and modern liberal constitucionalism. How else can we understand the life and work of men like John Locke, Immanuel Kant or Thomas Jefferson? Both Bin Laden and Dawkins fight their war with zealous and fundamentalist determination. Both of them share a strong commitment with the forces of blindness and irrationality. Both of them consider their enemies as stupid, and wicked. For Richard Dawkins, human beings are just a bunch of selfish genes, the contigent byproduct of matter, blind chance, and natural selection, without any claim to transcendent dignity. For Dawkins, in spite of the fact that all appearance and all probabilities point to the contrary, there is really no sign of intelligence and purpose in the universe. There is no transcendent realm of meaning. Scientific arguments, from cosmology and biology that lead to a design inference, in the words of William Dembski, even when they have the strongest pedigree from the standpoint of complexity theory, design theory and probabilities theory, are easily dismissed and explained away as prima facie incompatible with the metaphysical naturalistic premisses that lurk behind neo-darwinism and evolutionary theory in general. This is so, even if the design inference, besides beeing scientifically testable, seems to be the only way to make sense of morality, law, politics, human rights, and so on. These points suggest that Osama Bin Laden and Richard Dawkins are a part of a larger spiritual problem. The WTC attack seems to point to the spiritual and moral dimensions of our fallen existence, something that pos-modernism, deconstructionism and naturalism have completely forgotten. For a neo-darwinist like Richard Dawkins, conscience, awareness, mind, feeling, love, hate, good, evil, are all subject to naturalist reduction, even when that is accomplished through conceptual terrorist strategies like \\"fact-free science\\", \\"naturalism of the gaps\\", \\"wishful thinking\\" and a conveniently distorted  understanding og Occam's razor. Information and intelligent design, even if clearly detectable and measurable scientifically, are completely ignored, for the sake of blindness and chance. Yes, it is true. Richard Dawkins has emerged as a kind of Osama Bin Laden of \\"scientific naturalism\\". Men like Daniel Dennett, Michael Ruse and even Stephen Jay Gould, among others, are the Taliban of metaphysical naturalism, engaging in irrational acts of scientific terrorism, verysofisticated and well orchestrated. I think that here also a call to war is apropriate. Not a war of violence, intolerance, prejudice and dogmatism, but a war that preserves the integrity of the scientific method, willing to follow the evidence, and that remains epistemically open to other areas of human thought and experience, like theology, philosophy, law and ethics. In this war, intelligence and information play a crucial role. In my opinion, the Intelligent Design Movement is the best response to the \\"cientific terrorism\\" of metaphysical naturalism that, in spite of its scientific weaknessess, has held the modern man captive. We have to fight metaphysical naturalists them and smoke them out of their academic holes and bring them to justice, as Dr. Phillip Johnson started doing with is brilliant \\"Darwin on Trial\\". The true Enlightment Project is certainly more about connecting with the intelligent desigen that gives order, intelligibility, meaning and purpose to the universe and our lives, and not about the connecting with the spiritual forces of blindness, selfishness, chaos and irrationality, somethin that, each in their own way, Osama Bin Laden and Richard Dawkins seem to prefer.	2001-09-24

Evolution is indeed a dangerous idea, but not because it has become a tool for the deconstruction of judeo-christian civilization, as Dennett tries to defend. At least, Dennett makes clear that there is really an &quot;ideological design&quot; behind the denial of &quot;intelligent design&quot;. Evolution is a dangerous idea because, pretending to be scientific, it usually counts on narrative strategies that are all but scientific: &quot;fact-free science&quot;, &quot;naturalism of the gaps&quot;,&quot;just-so stories&quot;, &quot;wishful thinking&quot; and an account of Occam's razor that comes down to: &quot;while we can keep speculating about natural causes for all there is, we can keep ignoring all evidence of intelligent design, even when it stares one in the face&quot;. This unwilligness to know intelligent design when they see it leads naturalist &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;philosophers&quot; to render stupidity the status of the ultimate epistemological principle. According to this principle, there is, a priori, no need to differentiate between, design, on the one hand, and chance and necessity, on the other. Micro and macro-evolution are one and the same thing. The hundreds of antropic coincidences, the fine-tuning of the universe, the irreducible complexity of molecular machines, the complexspecified information of DNA and the astonishing communication ability of bactariae (including that of &quot;quorum sensing&quot;)are all sterile coincidences, the mere product of a blind and stupid evolutionary process combining matter, mutations and selection. There is also no need to differentiate, in kind, between a complex but unspecified string of letters, and a complex and specified one. Given enough time, even a monkey could write Hamlet and a tornado could create a Boing 747. For the folowers of this ultimate principle, defending evolution is above all a matter of principle, not a matter of evidence. This is in fact a dangerous idea. Comunism and national socialism were as stupid and dangerous. The stupidity principle is the necessary corolary of the denial of the absolute Logos, that gives purpose, order and intelligibility to the universe, that which makes science both possible and meaningful. Even Darwin somehow recognized that natural selection implies the existence of a mechanism, intelligently specified in advance, able to pick good from bad mutations. The fact is that information, intelligence, and design, are crearly present, detectable and measurable in nature. Nature combines intelligence, matter, mutations, and selection. Intelligence is a structural part of nature. Thus, evolution, more than a scientific theory is a spiritual problem. Its only true miracle lies in the fact that naturalist &quot;scientists&quot; have the ability to instantly develop &quot;scientific wings&quot; that allow them fly over the gaps of the fossil record, the origins of pre-biotic soup, the cambrian explosion, etc, thus adapting to situations of complete or lack of evidence. Just look at the &quot;scientific wings&quot; of men like Daniel Dennet, Richard Dawkins, and Steven Jay Gould. Aren't they a wonderful example of the evolutionary process? Beeing unable to anwer the fundamental questions (why, when and how did evolution start? how did nothing &quot;mutate&quot; to become something?; what &quot;selected&quot; being from non-being?), naturalism evolved to become an ideology of spiritual, moral and even scientific denial. The true &quot;enlightment project&quot; should be based not in Darwin's dangerous idea (the stupidity principle), but in the recognition of the absolute Logos, the Word, the light that shines upon darkness.	2001-08-28

Instead of &quot;the selfish gene&quot; you could use the formula &quot;the blind and stupid gene&quot;. So every time the book speaks about selfish genes, you would speak about blind and stupid genes. This would be the only alteration. Everything else would stay the same. I am sure that Richard Dawkins wouldn't notice, since time after time is has shown himself to be unable to distinguish intentional causes from blind chance. The fact that your book was almost totally identical, except for the blind and stupid genes, would be seen by Richard Dawkins as just another sterile coincidence, as something highly improbable but possible. The fact that it happened just proves that it is possible. I am sure Richard Dawkins would even use Occam's razor to get you out of trouble. But in case he comes up with an intellectual property legal action (running against his traditional modes of thought and inference) you can always count on Richard Dawkins' selfish gene theory to excuse yourself. You can say that you are just the casual product matter, mutations and selection that cumulatively resulted in a bunch of selfish genes trying hard to survive, and that copying Richard Dawkins'book was the most selfish strategy that they came up with. Besides, there is no such thing as a free and responsible self, just bunch of particles. What court in the world would condem a bunch of parcicles? I think this argument, blind and stupid as it may be, would put off Richard Dawkins. I'm sure he would not dare to censure morally and legally a bunch of selfish genes doing what comes naturally. It would certainly run against his darwinian world view. It had to.	2001-07-06

In this book we come accross a man of strong faith and intellectual ability. A man who is capable of the most incredible leaps of faith: from the prebiotic soup (which lies beyond the reach of empirical verification) to microevolution, and then to macroevolution, and then from here to a naturalist world view and even after that to imperialistic aspirations into all the fields of life, including the arts and religious sentiment. Richard Dawkins has develloped (by some strange form or meme replication) what it looks to me as a &quot;Kangaroo sientific method&quot;. The essence of this method is: &quot;just keep jumping!&quot;. Forget about the problem of the generation of huge amounts of information in the biological systems, forget about irreducible complexity of the mollecular systems, forget about the complex specified patterns of DNA, forget about the fossil record, forget about the dozens of &quot;antropic coincidences&quot;, forget about the difficult questions surrounding the big bang and anti-gravity. Just keep jumping! In this book we learn a bit more about our selfish genes.  Besides being selfish, they also have a sofisticated appetite for wonder, something they surely cultivate in their spare time, when they are not busy trying to survive. As the caring Pastor of our selfish genes, Richard Dawkins wants each and every &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; to be at peace when he starts feeling strange sentiments of wonder and awe before the magnificent cosmos that seem to point to its transcendent meaning. Far from being some kind of expression of the image of God in us, or some evidence of the meaninfulness of our inner selves, these sentiments are just another natural characteristic of our selfish genes, nothing that should disturb our naturalistic worldview. Richard Dawkins' care and counseling helps each &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; to assure himself that he and his deepest feelings are nothing more than the result of the blind, casual  and ultimately meaningless interaction between matter (no matter how it got here), chance (broadly define so to include all evidence of design) and natural selection. One has to wonder where Dawkins'appetite for storytelling comes from. Well, just keep jumping, man of strong faith. Or shall I call it &quot;naturalistic superstition&quot;? As a paradigm of the kangaroo scientific method, this book is worth a whole cosmos (including an infinite number of fictional ones), although Amazon.com only allows me five stars.	2001-06-12

Evading the intelligent designer is the &quot;ideological design&quot; behind scientific naturalism, that leads Darwinists not to know information and intelligence when they see it, at least in the realm of biology. In a way, they are right to be afraid.  That is why men like Richard Dawkins keep holding on to their own &quot;clever&quot; version of Occam's razor: &quot;as long as we can speculate freely about naturalistic explanations to nature and life, we shall keep ignoring all the evidence that points to intelligent design, no matter how strong this evidence is, and even if takes engaging in scientific acrobatics&quot;.  Darwinists have good reasons to be afraid, and to try their best to make up strong defense arguments, because it never got so bad to them. But even the strongest arguments appear more and more fragile. Thus, to protect the &quot;ideological design&quot; behind his scientific naturalism, Richard Dawkins keeps defending the thesis that &quot;appearence of design&quot; plus &quot;extremely high probability of design&quot; has necessarily to lead to the &quot;rejection of a design inference&quot;. To keep reaching to this pre-determined conclusion, against all odds and against paleontoligical, cosmological and biological evidence (just to cite some), Darwinists keep putting on a complex set of &quot;biased-memes&quot; called metaphysical naturalism, and insist on making sure that their dogmas can avoid competition in the academia, so as to escape the logic of the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; and the &quot;free and open encounter between truth and error&quot; (John Milton).  Richard Dawkins knows that the survival of his theory rests on the proof that, somehow,highly improbable events (v.g. the emergence life)that follow extremely complex and specified patterns (the patterns of DNA code)can reasonably be expected to result of chance, even if poorly qualified by cumulative selection. William Dembski has made this proof more and more difficult, if not totally impossible in the real world (that is, outside the heads of Darwinists, the only place where weird modes of thought and inference seem to make sense). Richard Dawkins also knows that the burden of proof is on his side: he and his peers have to come up with the evidence that irreducibly complex molecular machines can be &quot;designed&quot; by a &quot;blind&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; process. This is even more difficult to prove than the case that a monkey could design a Boeing 747. The situation of the Darwinists is getting more and more difficult. They know that they have been able to get, in the distant past, all the time of the world (and in all the other worlds that seem only to exist in their strange heads) to speculate about the probability of evolution of life as we know it, but they also know that, in the near future, they must produce evidence of &quot;blind specified complexity&quot;, because no one is willing now to give them some more billions of years (the kind of time frame they seem to like most)for them to make their case. William Dembski (along with others like Phillip Johnson, Jonathan Wells and Michael Behe) is little by little pushing Darwinists into a small corner. I apreciate the subtle way he does that. Small step by small step, like a competent chess player. Darwinists, prepare yourselves. The game will soon be over.	2001-06-07

In my mind, there is no doubt that Darwinism still exists because it has been able to protect itself from competition and cross-examination. Darwinism is afraid to expose itself to the same logic it defends: that of &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot;. Darwinism knows it is not fit to survive in the free and open encounter with alternative explanations. Men like Richard Dawkins and Steven Jay Gould are more and more aware that Darwinism depends to its survival on the proof that a succession highly improbable events, which corresponds to a highly complex patterns,  can reasonably be described as the result of mere chance. Richard Dawkins and Steven Jay Gould are more and more aware that they risk to be the laughing stock of the academia,&quot;the last ones to know&quot;. Beeing unable to distinguish between casuality and causality, chance and design, they would never be successful detectives, forensic experts, SETI scientist, anti-trust and intellectual property lawyers.The only place where there modes of thought and inference seem to be acceptable is in the field of naturalist science, and even here, as &quot;desperate resistants&quot;. By clarifying concepts such as design, information, intelligence, and pattern, through the concept of complex specified information,William Dembsky puts Richard Dawkins in a position that I doubt he can hold for a long time. William Dembsky allows one to understand the &quot;clever&quot; way Richard Dawkins uses the Occam's razor: &quot;as long as I can speculate about naturalist explanations for reality, I will keep ignoring all the evidence of intelligent design, no matter how strong and convincig it may be&quot;. For Richard Dawkins, it is clear that &quot;appearence of design&quot; (Dawkins) plus &quot;high improbability of design&quot; (Fred Hoyle) can only be seen as a refutation of a &quot;design inference&quot; (Wlliam Dembsky). As a law professor, I find this (ideo)logic totally unacceptable. I'm glad to see, by reading Dembsky, that I'm not the only one.It is more and more clear that Darwinism, a complex set of naturalistic &quot;memes&quot;, fears to become a standard example of &quot;extinction by competition&quot;. But the game will soon be over.	2001-06-06
US	47984649	R37O412AVCH4G4	0830822674	966060934	The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism	Books	5	60	70	N	N	The survival of the fittest: Darwinism won't survive	As a law professor in Portugal, I have been deeply inspired by Phillip Johnson's life and work. He has made it clear to me that lawyers should take part in this debate and give their own contributions. Phillip Johnson's contribution has been outstanding, as even his adversaries concede. In this particular work, Phillip Johnson shows clearly that Darwinism (in a broad sense) cannot aspire to become a &quot;total theory&quot; or a &quot;metanarrative&quot; of reality. It's flaws on the methodological and scientific levels are more than enough to render it's metaphysical extrapolations as nothing less than a philosophical fraud. Richard Dawkins obsession with chance explanations for natural events, for instance, reminds me of someone who tries desperately to cause the &quot;appearence of an accident&quot; (planting, faking and explaining away the relevant evidence), just to collect the money from the insurance company. Men like Phillip Johnson, William Dembski and Michael Behe, among others, just won't let him get away with it. The Wedge of Truth allows us to see the &quot;ideological design&quot; (not a very intelligent one, by the way) that lies behind the whole naturalist project. Needless to say that this project has devastating effects on the realms of politics, law, human dignity, human rights, freedom and responsability,and so on. Everything would be about the purposeless life of amoral and selfish genes. This form of materialistic rationality, certainly a kind of absolutism or fundamentalism, would mean the end of reason as we know it. Fortunately this is too stupid to be true. The fact is that Darwinism tends to run away form competing ideias, maybe because it fears becoming a standard case of extinction as a result of competition. Phillip Johnson and Wedge show clearly that human reason is ultimately founded on some form of absolute Reason. The nature of this Reason seems to be far beyond the scope of scientific inquiry, but it's presence is palpable and overwhelming in nature's huge amounts of information, something both as immaterial and as real as &quot;intellectual property&quot; (original work of authorship in a tangible form). Information is detectable and measurable by falsefiable and scientifically sound criteria.  Nature and life are not just about matter, mutations and selection. They are also about intelligence and information. Thus, the design argument has nothing (and I mean nothing!) to do with &quot;miracles&quot; of the &quot;God of the Gaps&quot;, but with the intrinsic form and substance of nature (much like the original work of authorship in tangible form), something that we, as intelligent beeings have a natural capacity to recognize (v.g. intellectual property is not a monkey business)and to study. This explains the misterious continuity between the objective structure of reality and the working of our subjective reason (Darwinists just take it for granted, that which makes science both possible and meaningful. Please read The Wedge of Truth. As Immanuel Kant would put it: &quot;Sapere aude!&quot; (sorry for my &quot;depleted&quot; english)	2001-05-09
