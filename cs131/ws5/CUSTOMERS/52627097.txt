Don Piper tells his story in this unforgettable book--with the help of author Cec Murphy, the reader experiences Don's accident and death along with him. He is with Don all the way as he finds himself before the pearly gates, then regrettably drawn back into his earthly body.  <br /> <br />The frustrations and pain Don endured were beyond my own understanding--yet I knew God had a plan for this man. I read it through in one sitting, then mailed the book to a friend who is undergoing chemo treatments. <br /> <br />I'm that sure it will uplift her spirits! <br /> <br />	2004-10-19

Was 9/11 foretold by the Bible?<br />This event and many others throughout history were predicted in the book of Revelation. &quot;Bind Up the Testimony, Seal the Law,&quot; arranged and paraphrased by Bonita M. Quesinberry, R.C., guides the reader through the seven church ages: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and the final, Laodicea. This last age is the time we live in now, counting down the last days of the world as we know it. Paraphrasing God's word, the author clearly shows why we are living in end times and how to find the related proof in the verses of the Bible. The 'Study Hints and Helpful Data' section is well worth the price of the book on its own, providing the reader with information on alleged Bible codes and other false teachings.<br /> Just as follows any earthly battle, plans follow for reconstruction. The book concludes with prophecy on 'Regeneration of Earth and of the Heavens.' What's to come isn't pretty, especially for non-believers, and the author states 'this book isn't for everyone. It is not for the faint of heart or fearful. It is for those whom God has called then chosen to<BR> follow His son Jesus.' This reviewer recommends it to anyone seeking the truth about the future, straight from the Bible.	2003-03-28

Have you ever wished that you could meet Jesus face-to-face and hear his story directly from Him? Well, this book is probably as close as you will get to that in this world. Ms. Quesinberry, using the first person narrative voice, speaks to the reader as Jesus might. Starting with the creation of the world, Jesus paraphrases the books of the Bible in a contemporary, easy to follow manner. He details his birth, life and death, and how it all ties together with God's plan for Earth from beginning to end. From Genesis through Revelation within 135 pages with all scripture references provided.<br />Ms. Quesinberry urges readers to forget everything taught them from corporate Christendom's global pulpits: rather, she encourages them to study their Bibles for themselves, including instructions on how and why: all with scripture. This book is very well-written and encouraging, and would make a great companion for Bible study. I highly recommend it.	2003-02-24

We're now well past the start of the millenium, whether you believe that event happened in 2000 or 2001, but that didn't dim my enjoyment of these stories in the slightest. The group as a whole is so strong, they can be read at any time and still be as charming and delightful as if you'd read them on New Year's Eve.----  <br />     Karen McCullogh, Scribesworld Reviews	2001-03-29

Sam and Rachel have drifted apart, neither understanding at the beginning of the story just how far. When she overhears him on the phone making plans to leave her right after Christmas, she is devestated,and realizes she has only twelve days to change his mind. In Sam and Rachel's tradition, the twelve days before Christmas (not following) are very special, and the magic of caring for unexpected foster children may help revive their love. But they've loved and lost children before, and the three who show up on their doorstep desparately needing a warm Christmas, have the power to tear the couple apart, or put them back together. This is an emotional story and I recommend a box of tissues and a big chunk of time to read uninterrupted.	2000-11-01

Former lovers Kim and Brandon reunite after ten years, when Kim's company transfers her in an effort to cover up an embarrassing office &quot;problem.&quot; Although Brandon is now widowed, Kim is unable to  forget that their relationship ended when she caught him with the woman who  later became his wife. Brandon is anxious to win a second chance with Kim,  but although the attraction still simmers between them, she seems  determined to play it cool. The couple might happily go their separate ways  except for one hitch. You guessed it, the secret baby. How does she plan to  break the news to him? That's the catch, and the delightful twist to the  story: SHE doesn't know that the child HE'S been raising is actually THEIR  baby! Confused? Good, because the mystery will keep you turning pages until  you fall in love with Brandon and Kim and start cheering them on as they  rediscover each other. The story is well written and well paced, with an  intriguing, original plot. The hero is warm, endearing and just clumsy  enough to keep him from being too perfect. The heroine is admirable, and  faces the difficult choices in her life with grace and courage.  I highly  recommend this book. To those who think they've seen and heard it all,  think again, because Robin Bayne is going to surprise and entertain you  with this imaginative tale of love rediscovered.	2000-05-03

Touchstone is one of those romances that grabs you by the emotions and won't let go. I read all 400 pages in one day--it was that good. The hero, Houstin, was strong and caring. The heroine, though confused, wasn't  &quot;too stupid to live.&quot; The reader understood her problems. The  only part I disliked was the amount of time spent in the villain's point of  view, because he was extremely deranged. Great story!	1999-12-27

Alejandro Sosa is in the US for a noble, plausible reason, and my heart went out to him. The author has taken a hero who could have been portrayed  as a stereotype and made him a hot, lovable character. The heroine's  brother supplied another source of conflict I'd not seen done before--sad,  but very realistic.The slow-building sexual tension kept me turning the  pages! Great story!	1999-10-28

Lindsey Michaels is your average American woman, meaning she's a bit larger than she'd like to be. She is easy for most readers to identify  with, and so quick-witted that she's the star of this story.
