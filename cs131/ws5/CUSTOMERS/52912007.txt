But much of its power for me and for many readers lay in how compellingly it steered us toward belief in yet another \\"vast conspiracy.\\" We live, after all, in an era defined for many by a dangerous blurring between imagined great conspiracies and equally colossal but bona fide deception and cover-ups by the institutions of power. Because of its immense success, Brown's book has spawned a parasitical industry of silly, imitative pseudo-history and shallowly reactive analysis. Bart Ehrman's \\"Truth and Fiction...\\" is neither of these.    When you read first-rate Science Fiction you probably find yourself thinking, \\"could it be?\\" - the distant future becomes tangible. If you read first-class Historical Fiction you've probably felt more of an, \\"I knew it!\\" - the dim past becomes peopled and coherent. I experienced a powerful combination of both reactions when I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Maybe you did too.  It was not just a ripping, good yarn; it tied together millennia-old histories that were as unknown to me as the 30th or 40th centuries are unknowable.     Ah. But the future really is fiction! It doesn't exist and is therefore subject to speculation, while the past was once someone's reality and is subject to the scrutiny of its actual artifacts. We tend to associate becoming too engrossed in futures with the tinfoil-helmet crowd, but we acknowledge the study of the past to be a legitimate field of professional study. Or do we?    Bart Ehrman is clearly one of those professionals - an historian of the Biblical and Early Christian eras. Dan Brown is a yarn-spinner. In this book Ehrman reminds us to remember that there is a difference.    Could it be? Is \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is mostly imagined, made-up, invented. I knew it... so did you.    In this thorough but very readable and not overly pedantic book, Bart Ehrman methodically takes apart the invented histories of DVC and assembles the more likely realities forus. He does not do so in a hostile or antagonistic way; in fact he repeatedly mentions how much he enjoyed reading DVC. But he is systematic in dismantling the fundamental pseudo-history at the core of Brown's book. By dissecting out the fabrications, Ehrman helps us to see what's left: believable personalities and credible institutional motives for sure. But any good Sci-Fi writer will do the same. Brown has merely avoided the tinfoil-hat association by claiming something presumed more real for his base - the past.    Ehrman's book is also an excellent commentary upon how history is actually done. He reminds us how honest historians, especially those of the barely-documented, distant past, can only approach the \\"more likely\\" at best. But approach it they do. He does a fine job of showing how such history is accomplished when done well; of how he and his colleagues have spent lifetimes building careful layer upon careful layer of the likely. But he demonstrates why \\"likely\\" has to be enough, and how it must be contrasted with the merely \\"imagined.\\" Ehrman makes it clear that one starts with the knowledge that history, even so presumably certain a past as our own \\"remembered\\" history, is always viewed through filters and passed forward to the present through distorting lenses of personality and culture. He gives a good sense of how working through this sort of fog is challenging enough not to be further burdened with reacting to fiction.    Now fiction is fiction, after all. But good Historical Fiction generally fleshes-out real events with a cultural matrix and people and personalities that are plausible. We think: \\"so that's why that happened.\\" Good Science Fiction populates a future with equally-believable peoples and motives and a credible path from our \\"now\\" to their \\"then.\\" We think \\"so that's how it's going to be.\\" In Sci-Fi, the more distant the future, the wilder the fiction can be - but we read it as imagination and smile and enjoy. It seems that Dan Brownhas created a new, more hysterical genre, call it Hy-Fi, which leaps an equal distance in the other direction to a past in which he can erect fabrications that only a clucking small crowd of historians will object to. But Ehrman is no chicken! This is clearly a David & Goliath mismatch, but Bart Ehrman has not backed down from the challenge. Good for him.	2005-01-15

With 17 countries on a 102-day itinerary and a careful eye on our budget, my son and I needed a book like this for our recently completed trip. Although we stuck with it until the end, I gotta say, Lonely Planet's \\"Europe on a Shoestring\\" has lots of flaws and you should think carefully before buying it. <br /> <br />THE GOOD NEWS: This is a great alternative to buying a dozen country-specific books. You'll save on pack weight and on dollars (or Euros). Furthermore, since its from Lonely Planet, this book does a lot better job than most of the \\"mainstream tourist\\" books of recognizing that a $300-a-night hotel room and a $50 meal are NOT in your plans. <br /> <br />THE BAD NEWS: (a) The prices and lots of info are out of date and getting more so. (b) The maps will taunt you with enough information to get you going but not enough to keep from getting lost, and (c) Overall the book offers a weird combination of too-much and too-little information. <br /> <br />You should consider this book only if you are planning to visit at least 10 different countries in Europe - otherwise you are better off buying individual country guides while in Europe (or sneaking a peek at the freebies stashed at many Hostel reception desks.)  <br /> <br />My rating is three stars because you have to realize that there is probably no book out there that does an adequate  job of `covering' all of Europe - but there are still lots of travelers, like us, who hope to do just that! <br /> <br />* * * details follow <br /> <br />(A) Check the COPYRIGHT date of the book very carefully before you buy! The one currently for sale is copyright early 2003. This sounded pretty current to us but it apparently means LP wrapped up whatever research they did into updating prices and other information sometime in 2001 or '02; for a trip in 2004 this was WAY OUT OF DATE. For one in 2005 it will be worse. It just gets to be a drag `translating' the prices: every 15 Euro Hostel is really going to be \\"18 to 20\\". Every 7 Euro admission fee: \\"9 or 10\\". Even expecting this problem,  it leaves you feeling like your \\"shoestring\\" is getting shredded even more than it already is! <br /> <br />And, of course, prices aren't the only thing that can change in 2 or 3 years! We ran into museums and sights that had been closed for months and even the very strange situation of the LP book saying a museum was going to be closed \\"until 2004\\" and then not offering any info about it... as we walked by its open doors! We also bumped up against some hostels and places to stay that were either listed but long-gone or unlisted but two-years-\\"new.\\" <br /> <br />Consider waiting for a new edition. <br /> <br />(B) The MAPS are a very strange problem. LP has made a clear effort to give you map info for the major cities in most countries and that shows that they realize you will probably be spending most of your time \\"pounding the pavement.\\"  But you won't really need their maps for getting around and touring a city - most major cities have much better maps available for free or cheap and you can usually rustle them up at the train station or hostel.  <br /> <br />The REAL REASON you will need the sort of  map this book provides is for the tricky first hour in a new city. You've just gotten off yet another train in yet another city and face another new language that's burbling all around you and your first goal is to get to your hostel or hotel and drop your pack.  <br /> <br />But the LP city maps are the worst possible compromise of providing not enough info to serve as touring maps but also not enough to get you from that first important point-A to point-B! They trim back on space and printing by only naming SOME of the streets. You'd be surprised how many different ways there are to walk out of a typical European train station! We were unhappily surprised how many times we did that and found ourselves on a street whose name did not grace the LP map. <br /> <br />OF COURSE ASKING strangers is a great part of the travel experience and most of the time it was fun to figure out the best sequence of gestures and pidgin English and pseudo-Eurish to ask someone where the heck we were! But you'll do plenty of that anyways and besides,  if, like Blanche DuBois, you've \\"always relied upon the kindness of strangers\\", why bring a guidebook at all? <br /> <br />(C) Its hard to whack LP for trying TOO hard; but when you are ending a 20 mile hike knowing that the 4-pound guidebook in your pack has at least 2-pounds of info about countries you aren't ever going to visit, it tends to ring in your mind with every step! This book was TOO extensive for us and I can't imagine anyone with an itinerary that would include even 75% of the countries listed. Do you want to lug around all that info on Lithuania and Latvia and Slovakia and Slovenia ? Our answer was to take a good sharp knife to the pages and hack out about 600 pages of excess. If you're a bibliophile and that prospect makes you shudder, at least think carefully about their \\"Western Europe\\" or \\"Eastern...\\" books instead. <br /> <br />At the same time, we often felt that the book offered too little information. For most of the larger countries, the book feels incomplete once you venture out of THE MAJOR CITY. I realize that this is the \\"we can't include everything\\" problem again, but its no help to understand their editorial challenges when you are lost in Lubeck or trying to find out about a place that's listed in your hostels book but not LP. <br /> <br />(D) Minor but annoying complaints include (1) less focus on hostels than I expected, (2) limited info on money-saving  \\"self-catering\\" (e.g. where to buy food to COOK) and (3) too much silly self-promotion (it became a joke with us to read the section for each country where they `recommend' other books about the country and somehow only ever recommend other LP guides! <br /> <br />(E) Minor but gratifying kudos for their (1) thoughtful and informative country histories, (2) limited but necessary language guides (you can go far indeed if you just memorize the words for \\"thank you\\" in most places) <br /> <br />I guess the fact is that traveling as we did, lots of countries, lots of cities and lots of short stays, isn't a reasonable way to see Europe. OF COURSE its better to spend two weeks in Berlin - and get a \\"Berlin Book\\" - or a month zigzagging through France - and buy a \\"France book.\\" But unless you've got unlimited time (and unlimited money) you'll probably face the same dilemma that drove us to our wacky itinerary and this ultimately unsatisfactory book: how can you sit there and plan to just \\"skip Italy\\" or \\"pass up Vienna\\"? Like us, like this book, you will probably end up trying too hard to do everything. <br /> <br />Enjoy your trip.  <br />	2005-01-04

The first was only quelled by Marshall Petain's promise to his army to sit-tight until the Americans came, and the second by the gargantuan financial and munitions assistance provided by those same Americans. In the spring of the new year the Germans gathered divisions freed from the war now ended in the East and proceeded to almost win the war in the west with their Kaiserschlacht in the spring of 1918. Its quite a history, and I picked-up this book in hopes of finding more of it fleshed-out.<br />Instead I found history rewritten and the American contributions not just downplayed but actively mocked.<br />I eventually stopped reading this absurdly biased book when I got to the part (early on) where the author scorns the AEF, the U.S. forces, for losing 9000 men in their first day of fighting in the Argonne - a rate of loss he claims to be higher than anything else in the war. Have the 60,000 lost by the British on the first day of The Somme been relegated to the memory hole? Can the four years of bungled leadership and slaughter of the French and British armies be ignored: a British army whose courage is certain, but whose history of losses is bitterly encapsulated by a phrase describing their decimation in the first months of the war as \\"The First 100,000.\\" For almost any day of actual battle that the British generals sent their men forward nine-thousand lost was trumpeted as a smashing victory!<br />This pathetic attempt to highlight Pershing's flaws leading the AEF over the genocide committed upon British soldiery by Haig and upon the French by Joffre and Foch and Nivelle was enough for me to realize that Mr. Dallas is of that breed of monomaniacally Anglophile WWI historians who occupy a special roost amongst the vultures picking at the corpses of the prior century. Factor in Dallas's apparent amnesia with respect to one of history's most infamous slaughters and one must wonder at what, exactly he might be fleshing out except the long-dead corpse of British martial and imperial glory.<br />Rather than trust your own background on the war to allow reading this fat book with balance, consider some others instead:<br />(a) Dallas holds the Germans 110% responsible for the war. Read Niall Ferguson's \\"The Pity of War\\" instead for a view that strongly supports the idea the Brits need not have entered the war at all and did so through the sly manipulation of fact and public opinion. Read McCullough's \\"How the First World War Began\\" for a detailed look at the manipulations of British and French militarists in the 20 years prior to 1914. For that matter read David Fromkin's \\"Europe's Last Summer\\" for a more studied view, albeit one leading to the same conclusion as Dallas. <br />(b) Dallas considers the Americans to be bumpkins and military incompetents. For alternative views read Mosier's \\"The Myth of the Great War\\" (or almost any contemporaneous German military report of their reaction to the arrival of one million fresh American troops on the front). Even Fleming's \\"The Illusion of Victory\\" presents a more considered view within its critique of the Wilson government's trampling of liberties at home to feed the hungry maw of the Franco-British war machine. <br />(c) Dallas considers the leadership of the British war effort to have been an astute bunch. For alternative views consider Laffin's \\"British Butchers and Bunglers of WWI\\" or Denis Winter's \\"Haig's Command.\\"  For anglophilia that at least honors not the butchers but those who actually fought and died read any of Lyn MacDonald's books.<br />I admit I never got to the parts of this book where it, presumably, treats with the armistice and the creation of the peace. It seems certain that you'd do better to read Fromkin's \\"A Peace to End all Peace\\", or the aforementionedFleming book, or Macmillan's \\"Paris, 1919: Six Months that Changed the World.\\"<br />Two stars for a good example of how malleable history can be at the hands of apologists for fools.	2004-05-20
US	52912007	R3MZKY8BMMHLZL	0786707976	281362106	To the Last Man: Spring 1918	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Dead Men Tell no Tales - The Eloquence of Survival	Lyn MacDonald's growing collection of books about World War I are unique in many respects and all are well worth a read - for both the student of the war and for readers only casually interested in the period.<br />From the point of view of a military historian, the war in 1918 was itself unique with its return to mobile warfare that had otherwise only existed at the outset of the war, with the arrival of U.S. forces on the fronts, and with the incorporation of new weapons technologies and tactical approaches on the battlefield. It was also unique as the year in which many felt the war might be won by the Germans but in which, ultimately, the conflict ended with German defeat.<br />MacDonald's view is not that of a  military historian, her book captures few of these elements. But it nevertheless casts a powerfully refracted light on the nature of the war in 1918 by the approach she takes. Hers is a \\"ground-level\\" view, seen through the many eyes of the soldiers who fought through that chaotic springtime of war.<br />As in many of her previous titles, MacDonald builds her history upon the actual words of combatants. These are the voices of the soldiers who fought. The book is more than an anthology of narratives, though. MacDonald does an excellent job of weaving the individual views into a well-told story. Although big-picture views are rare, she does a nice job of depicting individual experiences and local battles from many different points of view. It is rare to find the military history \\"microscope\\" focused at this particular scale.<br />Unlike prior books of hers that I have read, \\"...1918\\" is not limited to the perspectives of the British combatants. MacDonald has made a clear effort to incorporate the archived words of German soldiers by way of a small collection of such documents which were provided to her in translation. Nevertheless, her anglophile leanings are still quite evident and detract from the sense that the book is a balanced view. U.S., French andGerman soldiers are only a small part of this story.<br />Interestingly I found that this book offers much more of one element that you might expect the military historians to excel at - maps! There are more maps-per-page in this book than the best of John Keegan. Local details, right down to the farmhouses and roadways, abound, and add to your appreciation of the battle situations described by the combatants.<br />In addition to the small critique above that the book is Brit-focused, I have to note one other element of bias that might seem almost tautological in a book like this: most of the stories are those of survivors.<br />Just as history written by the victors is often skewed history, war as viewed by the survivors seems inevitably tempered by the reality of having \\"gotten through it.\\" MacDonald does sprinkle her story with contemporaneous writings of soldiers who did survive (and some who did not), but many of the accounts are from a retrospective viewpoint that is clearly colored by time. Just as rich men often only recall their own hard work, and pontificate about generic success deriving from hard work alone, survivors of warfare can, in the process of healing physical and emotional scars, of going on with life, gloss over their own or their buddies' weaker moments.<br />There is also an inevitable \\"selection\\" factor that an approach like MacDonald's can't overcome. Those who came back from the war unwilling or unable to talk about what they experienced cannot contribute their silence to a book like this. In his book \\"Back to the Front\\",  Stephen O'Shea can only indirectly discover the experience of his own stubbornly silent grandfathers, and his developing sense of the horror of that experience contrasts sharply with the overall tone of MacDonald's work.<br />If one can adapt to these limitations of approach, \\"To The Last Man: Spring 1918\\" is a fine book, excellently written and illustrated, which brings to life the desperate final months of the war that gave birth to the modern era and so many of the geopolitical ills of this new millennium.	2004-04-28
US	52912007	R1UHQFW9VVGR6C	0880015276	512893153	The Mooring Of Starting Out	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Ashbery's Pompatus of Love	Reviewing John Ashbery is a somewhat daunting prospect - but, then again, at one time I found just reading his poetry an equally intimidating proposal. Since you might be facing the latter situation, let me describe why I think this book, \\"The Mooring of Starting Out\\", is a particularly worthwhile place to enjoy Mr. Ashbery's work. Along the way I'll mention a useful book of essays about his poetry and try to briefly address the question of `meaning' in his poems.<br />You're probably here because you've read some of Ashbery's poetry - if so, you can't help but have noticed that his approach to language is very different from many poets. (If you have never read any of his work I suggest you go to the poets.org website to take a look at the samples posted.) If you remain undaunted, and are now considering buying this compilation of the contents of his first five books of poetry, good! Here's why.<br />Ashbery's first five books bounced around in style and approach much more so than his recent work. This is not to imply that he has settled into one or another form - he remains one of the most inventive poets around; just be encouraged to experience the wild ride that his early creative career seems to have comprised. You will get a multifaceted view of his paths to the powerful creativity of his more recent work: the magnificent epic of \\"Flow Chart\\" and the sweep of \\"Self-Portrait in Convex Mirror.\\"<br />Each of the five offers its own unique appeal. The poems from \\"Some Trees\\" show a range of experimentation unusual in a first book - a lot of people back in 1956 must have been wondering where Ashbery was headed. Then \\"The Tennis Court Oath\\" appeared and, I'm told, outraged the poetry establishment; its jarring `meaning-less-ness' apparently leaving some feeling they were being hoodwinked. In 1967 \\"Rivers and Mountains\\" demonstrated Ashbery's facility for the long poem with \\"The Skaters\\", and between that book and the following \\"Double Dream of Spring\\" can be found many of the works considered exemplary of his first 16 years. Finally, in 1972, came book number five, my favorite, \\"Three Poems.\\" Diving deep into a Proustian, paragraphless prose form, these three reflections on the nature of things seem as heartbreakingly timely now as they must have been then.<br />The really nice thing about \\"Mooring...\\" is that you have all five books in hand at once.  Notwithstanding their arrangement in chronological order, you can skip around. I'd encourage you to do so. Otherwise you risk a `big gulp' effect - a disorder of digestion that will come from trying to `get through' sixteen years of his writing in a few days. After all, readers of  \\"Some Trees\\" back in 1956 had six years to await the `outrages' of \\"Tennis Court\\"; six years to read and reread. Why should you clearcut the sixty-odd pages of \\"Trees\\" in an evening or two? Besides, the book comes with a stylish yellow bookmark-ribbon (at least the hardcover does), that you can use to keep track of a less-than-linear stroll through the poems in the book.<br />I must admit that I found myself frequently flummoxed by John Ashbery's poetry over the past few years since I first discovered his \\"Flow Chart.\\" I was, nevertheless, drawn like a moth to SOMETHING in there. Now you may be a more clever reader than I, but it took a few prostheses for me to figure out what was going on - to start to get an idea why I was drawn to the poetry and what I was getting out of it.<br />If that sort of push-pull relationship has brought you this far to take a peek at his early work, let me loan you my crutch. I discovered a copy of \\"Beyond Amazement\\", a book of essays about Ashbery's poetry, published in 1980 and edited by David Lehman.  I found this book invaluable. Sort of like those hook-ish things rock climbers use. You might still find yourself swinging out in space, but one or another of the essays in \\"Amazement\\" will have offered a view of the nature of Ashbery's poetic quest that can serve as an anchor of sorts.<br />You may, like me, skip the few essays in \\"Amazement\\" which overdo the lit-crit crowing, but mostly they are helpful: quite frank in acknowledging the `problem' of meaning in Ashbery's poetry and quite insightful in providing conceptual anchors for his readers. And since these essays were published before Ashbery's big `hits' they tilt more toward the works collected in \\"Mooring.\\"<br />With the help of \\"Beyond Amazement\\", I have come to a wider appreciation of the forms of meaning in Ashbery's poetry and to a more satisfying reading of \\"The Mooring of Starting Out.\\" Explicit meaning can be seen as only a piece of what most of us seek in poetry or any art. Given the wordless form of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, would we deny its powerful effect on a listener as holding no `meaning.' For that matter, just think about all those pieces of popular music over the years which you hummed over and over but whose lyrics you never even understood - what was the \\"pompatus of love\\" that Steve Miller sang of? We seem to feel meaning tugging at us from unverbal or simply incomprehensible realms, whether in poetry or any other work of art.<br />John Ashbery has spent almost fifty years mulling the ability of words, word-sounds, and even word-absences to line up on a page and nevertheless chart the less-than-linear bridge to meaning. \\"The Mooring of Starting Out\\" offers a fine glimpse into his early efforts.hor of sorts.<br />You may, like me, skip the few essays in \\"Amazement\\" which overdo the lit-crit crowing, but mostly they are helpful: quite frank in acknowledging the `problem' of meaning in Ashbery's poetry and quite insightful in providing conceptual anchors for his readers.

Scanning through the lists, I see that I'm clearly the contrarian when it comes to reviews of this book on Amazon - but I know I wouldn't have wasted an evening reading the first 50 pages of it if I had seen a few negative reviews such as this. Maybe I can save one or two of you some time as well.<br />If you are looking for a perspective on World War I which enacts its \\"artistic\\" license by comparing the German invasion of Belgium to a swarm of ants, that demonizes the Kaiser and glorifies the stalwart French and British generals - this is the book for you!  I have to wonder, though -- if you think those are central elements of a description of what took place in August of 1914, why bother? You already know the history and are just looking for someone to arrange it in elegantly crafted lines. But if you believe that such lively metaphor and monochrome white-hat/black-hat perspectives could hardly explain the historical world any better than they do our own era, stay clear.<br />I'm no expert by any means - but I've developed an interest in the war and the era, and a year of reading WWI-related books, has led me to two conclusions: (1) it was a darn complicated chunk of history - the leading-up-to, the four-years-slaughter, and the reverberating after-effects and (2) attempts to \\"spin\\" the story have been entwined with the factual record to such a degree that they are themselves an intriguing piece of the history. Tuchman's tale neither explores the complications nor acknowledges the spin. She tells a simple tale in wonderfully dramatic language thats as good as anything Tom Clancy can produce, but its designed more for the heart than the head.<br />There are many, many books about WWI from the inter-war period and some of them can still stand a look. But there has also been an intriguing resurgence of interest in and publishing on the war during the last decade which, itself, is a phenomenon that hints at something fascinating about who writes history and when (and how)they write it.<br />If you are looking for books with a perspective that goes beyond the swarm of ants approach Id recommend Mosiers The Myth of the Great War and Fergusons The Pity of War. The former is startlingly pro-German (and pro-American - quite a combination, that) and the latter, although leaking some of the usual pro-Brit tone, constructs a quite-detailed pathway to thinking about the big what-if  if Germany had won the war. Keegans section about the Somme in The Face of Battle goes beyond the usual military history (but avoid his two Histories of the war itself) and the recent 14-18, Understanding the Great War by Audoin-Rouzeau is flawed but demonstrates how even a Francophile perspective can at least explore different realms.	2003-05-07

This book was the one that introduced me to his work and it is absolutely the best place for you to do the same; all the more so since he just has released the dreadfully lightweight \\"Porcupine Kisses.\\" Once I decided to write a one-star review of that book, I felt it only proper to post this 5-star counterpoint first. This book is a great place to experience the range and power of his work.<br />Poetry is so darn hard to review. At its best it lodges in and lights up neuronal nooks and crannies that were invisibly personal but become, somehow, unexpectedly universal. Very mysterious. <br />Dobyns manages to capture that 'universality' in his poetry in a manner that repeatedly surprises. Lots of poetry achieves this by rooting itself in the well-known. Dobyns takes a contrary tack. The poetry in this book often seems to concern people or places that you'd hardly expect to have the slightest interest in - certainly not at the level of seemingly narrow focus that he brings to his view of the world. Would you seek out depictions of street scenes in Santiago? on the work of the artist Balthus? the last breaths of a bull in the ring? The very different-ness of these points of view and odd scenarios accentuates the twang of recognition in your heartstring when it is plucked.<br />This poetry has a distinctive feel to it - gritty and detailed, but languorous in pace. It is an unusual sort of languor, though. It isn't landscaped pastoral; on the contrary the poetry is vigorously 'peopled.'  It isn't sleepy, either, a sense of time and movement pervades; but the sense of motion is often an orbital one. Time seems to win, either through timelessness or a seemingly inevitable cycling - recidivists, returning to serve their life sentences.<br /> I'd encourage you to read the \\"look inside\\" pages posted here on Amazon to get a flavor of this (although none of the fourpoems included are among my favorites). The one is not a poem about a street scene in Santiago - it's 'about' the six garbagemen, the chocolate cake, the two matrons and the black dog- and somehow it's about how we all stagger through our days; how pleasures leak into them through unexpected fissures.<br />Others have commented that Dobyns poetry has a \\"masculine\\" feel to it and I will, guardedly, agree - although I can't quite put my finger on the \\"how\\" of that bit. It is visceral poetry, for sure, (sometimes literally so as when the body's organs are given voice in selections from \\"Body Traffic\\") and it celebrates lusts as much as loss - even the losses that are sown by the lust. Although dark and broody at times, it also relishes the small triumphs against the relentless press of our inadequacies. If its \\"men's poetry\\", its certainly not a youth's voice. But it grazes up against the \\"why\\" of facing another day, even the why of being a jerk, a fool, a recidivist, with an oddly under-emotional shrug that might seem essentially masculine.<br />As a collection of poems from seven or eight prior books, \\"Velocities\\" swings through a variety of poetic forms and tones. It is a comprehensive representation of the best work of a major American poet.	2003-03-11

Dobyns is one of my favorite poets but this \\"collection\\" is a big disappointment. Read his \\"Velocities\\" instead.<br />\\"Porcupine Kisses\\" is composed of three forms of writing plus the illustrations by Michels. None of these four elements is either entertaining enough or meaningful enough to justify buying or reading the book.<br />Dobyns' extensive poetic work to date suggests a skeptical view of  the world and its mores - but having bought this book I feel like I'm the one he's snickering at. It is a physically unsatisfying volume as much as it is an overpriced one. I'm not sure what's up with his publisher situation, but Dobyns' recent (poetic) works have all been slender paperback-only editions printed on a sort of cheesy-cheap newsprint and priced like parchment. In this book the woodcut-style illustrations seem to have been added either to create the illusion of \\"high art\\" (ahh... the slender chapbook on linen paper, hand-colored by the artist) or in an attempt to pull together the three disparate textual elements (umm... adding enough stuff to this pot will allow us to call it bouillabaisse). From a poet whom I have always counted on to cork the phony burble of sentimentality, either rationale for the illustrations is cloyingly discordant.<br />The first half of the book alternates brief, half-page prose pieces with  half-page clumps of aphorisms. The prose is interesting enough, I suppose, but it really is just prose. It contrasts sharply with the wide range of poetic forms Dobyns has employed over the years. Many of these have veered close to the prose-poem form, but never have they lost the element of finely-chiseled facet that form imposes on mere prose. The aphorisms, to put it bluntly, hardly rise above the level of fortune cookie pithiness.<br />The last half of the book is comprised of what another reviewer has generously termed \\"daffynitions\\" - odd little definitions of words that are supposed, I guess, to cast a refracted light on their meanings. I found few of them either humorous or meaningful and certainly wasn't willing to plough through pages and pages of an alphabetized listing to uncover the odd gem. I wonder if Dobyns fancies himself the John Ciardi of the new millennium.<br />In my opinion, Dobyns is a master of language and modern poetic form who has always mixed a wry but clear-eyed incisiveness with somewhat more languorous poetic story-telling. (He must be a good, native story-teller if one can judge from his immense body of fictional work.) But his poetry has also always carried a certain worldly-weariness that seems to have settled too heavily on the shoulders of the writer of this book, and squeezed out these two parts in these equally unsatisfying ways: the one meanderingly prosaic and the other evaporated to dry dust.<br />The essence of my favorite poem by Dobyns,  \\"Querencia\\" (collected in his \\"Velocities\\" from an earlier book), might well be distilled down to one or two lines when I try to describe it to friends; but in doing so, I know I will fail before I start. In this book Dobyns seems to have exhaustedly decided that all the in-betweens can be skipped and merely the fragmented end result delivered. I can't say I agree. In \\"Querencia\\" the bull inevitably, exhaustedly drags itself back to its seemingly arbitrary safe spot - perhaps blankly aware that the safety is only illusory.

But the academics want you to believe that they capital-U-understand what has happened, and they will flock to elevate one of their own to that end. I doubt if half of the positive reviews steering this book to best-seller lists actually finished the book. I did, and do not recommend it. (Note, even, how the paperback release has a subtly different subtitle - someone is working hard to \\"position\\" this book based on appearance rather than substance).<br /> * * *<br />With so many westerners looking for answers as they look to the Middle East and Islam, its no surprise that this book has been well received by many reviewers. Like you, and me, they have been jolted to step back and actually look at a region of the world long consigned to the backwaters of interest by Western intellectual elites.<br />It really is a puzzle, isn't it? How could the empires that we credit with much of our intellectual heritage - empires that were pre-eminent on the globe (excepting perhaps China) for 500 years - how could they have disappeared so completely from the main stage of history? Now, in our time, it has become a truly dangerous puzzle as we view the violent efforts of some to restore the primacy of fundamentalist Islam.<br />What went wrong, indeed; a fascinating and important question upon which Mr. Lewis, the New York Times' \\"doyen of Middle Eastern studies\\", ought to have cast some valuable insight. Instead, this book can be added to the shamefully growing stack of publishing industry attempts to cash in on the post-9/11 fears of the West. That the publisher is the esteemed Oxford University Press only demonstrates the more so how difficult the western elites are finding this challenge to be. They have few answers but will smother us with their attempts.<br />\\"What Went Wrong\\" is a poorly stitched-together amalgam of ideas large and small - more often the later. Broad themes such as the relative status of women in Christendom and Islam receive merely a wave or two, roughly equivalent in this \\"analysis\\" to the differing role of the theater in the two cultures. One comes away thinking that the lack of timepieces in Islamic societies and the lack of perspective in their art might be as important as the role of slavery or the non-Muslim in their worldview. The book provides very little analysis and no perspective.<br />Perhaps Lewis has honestly answered the precise question, \\"what\\" went wrong by creating this meandering laundry list of \\"things that are different between\\" the two cultures or \\"ways in which the Middle East did not adopt western modes\\". Perhaps I was expecting too much in assuming the implicit \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" in that title.<br />The book ends with an interesting enough chapter entitled \\"conclusion\\" - except that it is actually more appropriately an introduction! No pieces of argument are called together to summation. On the contrary, the intriguing questions that might launch our inquiry into the divergence of the two cultures are coherently, if vaguely, stated. Notwithstanding a brief apologia at the beginning noting the book being in \\"page proof\\" when the twin towers were felled, it seems obvious that this conclusion was tacked-on after the events of September 11.<br />Only at the last page do you discover a hint of how such an odd book might have come together. An \\"Afterword\\" notes that, \\"the core of this book was a series of three public lectures given at...\\"<br />Aha! That's what went wrong! Someone seeking post-9/11 \\"material\\" realized that three interesting, albeit narrowly academic lectures about the Middle East combining with three hundred million people asking \\"why?\\" could hit the charts. Toss in academics and reviewers and so-called intellectual elites anxious to show that they can bring their heretofore invisible abilities to solve \\"the problem of Islam\\" and you've got the mixings for a shameful mess. One star for lots of interesting little bits and a few big questions - which someone, hopefully, will take a stab at actually answering someday.lve \\"the problem of Islam\\" and you've got the mixings for a shameful mess.

A practicing military historian, with a good grasp of the geography of Europe in 1914, might thoroughly enjoy this book. Apparently many have. It is immensely detailed in its treatments of the battles of the war and doubtless such detail informs a keen grasp of any battle. But that detail is almost completely unsupported by maps, keys or legends allowing the less-expert reader to maintain his bearings.<br />If you don't know the difference between a corps and a brigade, if you haven't memorized the twists and turns of the rivers of Europe along with the lay of the forests and of the ridges, you will be simply lost. Can you locate Luxembourg in your mental map of Europe? picture the fit of Belgium into Germany? sketch the course of the Meuse? Consider this passage:<br />\\"Lanzerac, in a conference held at Chimay on the afternoon of 21 August, told the Chiefs of Staff of his subordinate corps that the plan was for Fifth Army to hold the high ground on the south bank of the Sambre. He feared that if he committed his soldiers to hold the dense belt of little industrial buildings and cottages - le Boringe - that line the bank between Charleroi and Namur, they would become involved in small-scale street fighting and be lost''<br />After 95 pages of this I quit. Just looking at the number of times my spell-checker choked on the preceding paragraph reminds me of how densely geographic the first quarter of the book was. I honestly considered reading it with an atlas at hand - but that's hardly a relaxing read.<br />Excepting European and world maps printed on the front and back pastedowns, the book provides only 15 maps over the entire 450 pages and 4 years of war. All but one, I might add, appear after my own defeat on page 95! Few of these support the level of on-the-ground detail of Keegan's text. When they do so, as in the case of his map of the famous Gallipoli battle, which provides both detail and an inset reminding one where the Gallipoli peninsula is, it reminds oneof what was glaringly absent in the dozens of prior battle descriptions. <br />The book has two discrete segments of photographs which seem to be a somewhat random assortment of images, albeit suitable gritty ones. For more illustration a later, putatively separate book provides 'An Illustrated History of the First World War' which I have reviewed separately (hint' still no maps !).<br />As a final critique, this book would more aptly be titled 'A Military History of the First World War'. Although it devotes a decent handful of pages up front to noting the diplomatic stutterings that failed to prevent the war, it hardly seems to address the world outside the battlefield after 1914. <br />Two stars for the immense amount of military detail.	2003-02-18

I have written a lengthier, critical review of Keegan's minimally-illustrated &quot;The First World War&quot;, which needs summarizing here in part because the text of that earlier book is essentially reproduced here. There is little point in owning both.<br />My complaints about the earlier book remain unappeased, but this illustrated edition at least provides a comprehensive visual sense of the Great War. Its inherited failings, in my opinion, are a duo:<br />(1) Very limited use of maps, either geographic or battlefield, coupled with extensive, extremely detailed descriptions of the geography and movements of battles. This will leave all but the student of the war skimming names and places that float disconnectedly in a vague, abstracted geographic space; somewhat similar to the way one reads an old Russian novel in which the blur of Raskalnikovovitches is cured only by a geneology. This book, illustrated or not, includes only the same, sparse count of 15 maps as the earlier text.<br />(2) Essentially no attention to the world beyond the battlefield. Keegan introduces his text with a decent description of the diplomatic flounderings that preceded the war, and also makes a sound case that military prerogatives propelled the early months' movement toward stalemate. But one does not get the sense that actual governments or peoples were anything other than bystanders to this war. Perhaps this is, indeed, the case, but I imagine a social or political historian would differ. This book remains a \\"Military\\" history, illustrated or not.<br />These flaws earned the earlier book only two stars. The additional one I propose for this volume is earned by the extensive illustration. In a Technicolor world of laser-guided, night-sighting weaponry, it is easy to bury \\"the old world\\" in black and white portraits of kings and tsars. This book suffers from having a few too many of those, but its solid selection of looking-you-in-the-eye soldiers, mud-at-your-ankles trench-shots andeven the apparently scarce photos of battle-in-progress brings the gritty reality of this war to reality; black-and-white or not.<br />The illustrations are often only loosely associated with the chronology of the text - rarely could the text actually ask you, for instance, to \\"see figure 1\\" - which illustration shared the page and enhanced the text.  This, of course, reflects the fact that the book is a bit of a \\"paste-up\\" - the illustrations were pretty much inserted into the pre-existing text. Furthermore, the body of illustrations seems needlessly padded with old shots of generals and leaders. Keegan (presuming he actually selected the photos and other illustrations), seems to have only casually pulled from the vast archive of period photos. The actual text would have been much enhanced by a more careful (albeit time-consuming) process of photo-selection that does not seem to have taken place. (It's actually more than likely that Keegan did not select the illustrations at all. He seems to have become a bit of \\"an industry\\" in the military history publishing business. Search on his name and you will find dozens of listings where he has been called upon to edit this or that or to write an introduction to someone else's work.) One imagines a very busy junior editor at work with these photos. Perhaps I'm too cynical - in which case credit Keegan with an only mediocre sense of the uses of illustration.<br />The book is enhanced, but also interrupted, in a sense, by short thematic groupings of photos and associated text such as \\"Communications\\" and \\"Military Medicine.\\" These are interesting in their own right, but also highlight the fundamental problem of this book - it cannot be read in any fluid sense. The illustrations persistently call one away from a careful reading of the text but the illustrations alone do not come close to telling a coherent story. I found myself flipping ahead looking at photos and reading their supporting text and then backing up and readingonly the text.<br />I remain unsatisfied by either Keegan book and will aim my search toward the few \\"atlases\\" of the War available for mapped military history and for less battle-focused texts to tell the whole story. Maybe recognizing that two or even three good books are needed here is at the core of my critique of this one, which tries to be more than it is. It remains for you to decide what you wish to own.	2003-02-18

Would a horse, no matter how trained, charge directly into a mass of armed men? Would they flinch? Would the horse turn? Could they really be routed in ways so colorfully portrayed in paintings of war when it seems simply impossible to fit so many horses or men into so small a space, to leap through the mass of other flesh? What did it really mean to be struck a sword's blow or a by musket's ball? What became of a man wounded in no man's land, or captive, or a slaughterer of captives. Keegan's questions range from the deepest questions of humans facing death to the pragmatic problems of daily needs and mud and dirt and flesh. This book is apparently unique among military histories in raising and contemplating them.<br />Keegan offers an oddly heightened awareness of these questions by noting right at the beginning that he has not, in fact, ever been a soldier. He has been called upon to teach and to mentor them as one of the most esteemed military historians of our era but he has not stood in those boots. But much more so than any foot soldier or general he has studied \\"battle\\" enough to understand that the confusion that underlies these encounters can only be distilled from a distant perspective. Although he honors and acknowledges the first-hand accounts of participants, by simply noting the level of confusion, the restrictions and overload on sensory input, and the inevitable role of the survivor's ego, he reminds us that much more is happening than personal viewpoint or formalist analysis could describe.<br />Keegan chooses to look at three battles from history: Agincourt, Waterloo and The Somme. All three are what historians apparently term \\"set battles\\" but each called upon its participants to face death, or glory, or simply the esteem of their neighbor, in different ways. While he maintains his focus on the individual soldier, Keegan does a fine job of making each of these three historically momentous battles come to life in full scale.<br />Written in a style that is relaxed but incisive, \\"The Face of Battle\\" is a fascinating work.	2003-02-18

If you are, like me, an &quot;amateur&quot; when it comes to the study of the mind, you have probably sought to balance your reading of  philosophers like Dennett with something more solid from the science of mind. &quot;Enchanted Looms&quot; is a fine place to do that.<br />This is not a book to sweep through in a few days. You will want to pause and digest. Although Cotterill is clearly aiming at an educated layperson as a reader, he bows, stylistically, to an academic audience. This interfered with my reading of the book. Dozens of times per chapter, he cites sources parenthetically or within the text. Too many sentences begin in the form &quot;The work of _x_ and _y_ has shown...&quot; For the longest time I kept thinking that noting and remembering those names would help me in following a line of argument. This was rarely the case. But then, at times, a backward reference to &quot;_x_&quot; would stump me. Once I learned to glide over these I found it much easier to read the book.<br />The tie-in with &quot;neural networks&quot; was an interesting process since I had little sense of their importance in cognitive science. Cotterill does a nice job, initially, of showing how such structures might work in both the abstract and at the level of neural anatomy. But, interestingly, he moves on to make a convincing case that such structures cannot adequately model all the functionality of the human brain. I came away from this book with the sense that neural nets are the \\"Ptolemaic epicycles&quot; of brain science - a paradigm that with growing complexity and constant tweaking can just barely model what we know about a physical phenomenon, but which are not up to the ultimate task.<br />Cotterill does a nice job of making the macro-anatomy of the brain a part of a meaningful whole. Too many neuro-anatomy-focused books seem to just carve out the various regions and leave a sense of oddly unconnected \\"vision centers\\" and \\"speech centers.\\" \\"Enchanted Looms\\" presents much more of the sense of the interconnectedness of those zones that we have chosen to isolate as anatomical pieces. He goes into some depth about how these connections might themselves function as a layer in the processing that we call thinking or sensation, ... or consciousness.<br />Which brings me, in the end, to the grail in my own \\"brain-book\\" search - \\"consciousness.\\" Sure its fascinating to realize how interesting the study of, for instance, vision, might be, but its that \\"me\\" in there, in HERE, that wants some explaining.  Although this is not the focus of Cotterill's book, he does propose a very different model for consciousness from any that I have seen - seemingly centered around neuro-motor systems; an odd twist on the notion of a \\"muscle-head\\" !  I say \\"seemingly\\" because it was really only upon reading this concluding section of the book that I realized I might not have understood enough of the prior 500 pages.  Cotterill's argument for this unusual underpinning of consciousness seemed somewhat unconvincing, to me, only to the degree that it built upon elements of his model for brain that I had only partially grasped.<br />So I will reread this book... a very unusual thing for me, for this topic. It bespeaks the power of the ideas it presents that I know \\"Enchanted Looms\\" will be worth that second effort.more of the sense of the interconnectedness of those zones that we have chosen to isolate as anatomical pieces.

I have a long shelf of project-books, activity-books and all the rest that I bought to add some spice to the day in math class. This is my \\"go to\\" book. I use it every year, repeatedly. I use it in my \\"accelerated\\" classes and I use it in my \\"math lab\\" classes. <br />The math selections are outstanding in both interest and challenge levels - they also scale up to allow very bright students to be engaged. And if, like me, you've slogged through too many lame \\"cooperative learning\\" books and activities to count, you will be pleased with the design of that element of the program.<br />The book organizes more than 100 problems into 24 categories within 4 groups, \\"Patterns\\", \\"Spatial\\", \\"Proportion\\" and \\"Open\\". Each problem provides 4 printed clues which provide pieces necessary to solve an overall problem. Here is an example from the \\"Product Chain\\" category of \\"Proportion\\", a rather unusual zoo:<br /> * Rodelians feed every night. Each rodelian eats five snoppets.<br /> * Snoppits feed every night. Each snoppit eats three quigs.<br /> * Pipworts feed every night. Each Pipwort eats four dorblatts.<br /> * Quigs feed every night. Each quig eats twelve pipworts.<br />The problem, in this case, is itself stated in pieces spread over the 4 clues. The group is ultimately asked to propose a method or rule for finding out how many dorblatts will be needed to keep a given number of rodelians alive.<br />This is an intriguing enough problem, mathematically, for 4 average 6th graders, but the challenge is multiplied by the \\"cooperative learning\\" design. Each student receives one clue but they are not allowed to show their clue to the others in their group. They can draw and illustrate their clue to show to others and they can even read it aloud - just not show it. At first this seemed an oddly crafted constraint but, after using the \\"UWS\\" problems for 5 years now I see that it is just the right touch. When denied only the visual access to theirpartners' clues,  the kids tend to switch out into first reading them aloud - feeling, sometimes, like they are 'beating the system'. But, inevitably, just hearing it is not enough for their group-mates and they have to hunker down and reread, understand and restate or illustrate their clue in order to get anywhere.<br />other notes:<br />The clues are not numbered. For a problem like the one noted above, the group themselves have to discover and organize the sequence of relationships and solution steps. <br />For most problems two \\"hint\\" clues are provided as what we now call \\"lifelines\\". These usually provide not extra data but prompts for looking at the overall problem from a different view (e.g., for the above \\"Hint: One way to test your scheme is to see if it works if there is only one rodelian, or two.\\"<br />NO ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED to the teacher! I hated this, then I loved it! As a practical necessity I eventually wrote up an answer 'bank' I could refer to - but with my accelerated classes I found it even more worthwhile. They so often rush to an answer then rush to me for 'validation' - something I'm always trying to shake them of. It introduced a real element of meta-learner challenge when I would reply to their \\"is this right?\\" by saying \\"I don't know. Its up to you and your group to decide if you are confident enough of your answer to move on to a harder problem.\\"<br />The problems are organized one-per-page in the spiral book and are intended to be photocopied and then cut out. I store the 6 clue papers, each about 4\\" x 3.5\\", in envelopes and try to keep 7 or 8 copies of each so that 28 or 32 kids can be working on the same problem if necessary.<br />As mentioned before, the problems within each of the 24 categories are mathematically similar but get harder to solve in the order that they appear in the book. I usually set out a \\"suite\\" which allows an open-ended element to keep the brighter kids engaged.<br />Groups of three are easily accommodated by simply allowing one member to `work' two clues.<br />I have used the book with 6th and 7th graders. It is labeled as being for grades 5-10. At either end of that range, my impression is that still roughly half of the problems are appropriate. It is a great match for grades 7 and 8.<br />Some of the especially interesting categories of problems include \\"Nim Games\\", some nice \\"3D point of view\\" ones, Calculator based, \\"Mystery Ops\\", and my favorite, \\"Alien Number Systems\\".  There are even two neat problems that demonstrate `fractal automata' solved using paper grids and colored pencils. Nice, nice, nice !<br />Once you've seen a few of these problems you might think you could make up your own and, in fact, the book encourages you to do so. That being the case, I have to say I've never done so. The sheer number of problems in this one book is more than adequate unless one wanted to actually build a curriculum around their use. If you ever feel you have \\"used up\\"  \\"United We Solve\\" you can check out their second volume, \\"Get it Together - math Problems for Groups\\", which is pegged to grades 4-12.	2003-01-17

This book will surprise you more than once, and in doing so surprise again since, from the outset, it sure looks like the sort of book you wouldn't expect to offer any surprises at all - its just history, right?! <br />This fascinating volume will provide its surprises to readers with a desire for more substance in their understanding of the Scots, but also to those exploring the broad notion that there's more than dry old dust to be raised from looking back to \\"the Enlightenment\\" for meanings important in assessing a difficult and dangerous future for \\"the West.\\"<br />Some reviewers have suggested that \\"How the Scots Invented the Modern World\\" is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek treatment - hinting that it appearance following on the heels of Cahill's \\"How the Irish Saved Civilization\\" is merely a consequence of some sort of publishing industry templating. I could find nary a tongue nor a cheek. This is a quite serious history written by a quite serious historian who states a compelling case for considering the substantial, possibly preeminent contributions of the Scots to the European enlightenment. That he does so in a way that is convincing is a credit to his skill as a writer as much as to unique power of the underlying theme.<br />I am not a reader, hardly even an appreciator, of History. I am, however, Scottish by descent and brought up, as were so many American Scots in the 50's and 60's, with a regular exposure to the trappings of the culture set up as a colorful surround to a vague sense of the history of a people somehow grand but sad. This has drawn me to more than a few 'histories' of the Scots over the years but I don't think I've finished a one of them. All those battles - with hardly a victory to be found... all those kings and queens - with hardly a Scot among them!<br />If, like me, you have been drawn by the feeling that there must be more beneath the mere skirl of pipes (or was it kilts that skirled?), but found that somewhere around Culloden or the Clearances it was just too indigestible a haggis of depressing detail, then this is a book for you. It will cleanly but convincingly detach you from some of the more romantic simplifications lodged in the popularized image of the Scottish people. But it will balance the amputation with the attachment of a quite interesting prosthetic, a history that is one of ideas - and big ideas at that!<br />This book will gently but firmly disperse your romantic notions of the culture of the Highlands. While giving gracious due to the Highlanders ancestral values of clan as family and honor through battle, Herman makes it clear that by the time the clans had entered the era where modern historical consciousness pegs them, they were mostly just conveniences through which a primitive, feudal social and economic structure was maintained by wealthy and distant \\"chiefs.\\"<br />Herman does not set out, explicitly, to remove the kilted and piped 'noble Scot' from the picture, but by effectively doing so he opens the story to his more intriguing theme. That is the story of how cultural and religious change, often energized and honed by the conflicts with England, led to the creation of a vastly literate populace with a deep sense of the rightful role of the individual in structuring the institutions of society. It is the story of how that populace elevated ideas and individual to a conjoint prominence that became manifest in the major institutions of learning and commerce which, together, supported a mutual defining of what Herman asks us to agree is truly \\"the modern.\\"<BR> <BR>As an example of the subtle but deeply convincing surprises the book parses out of this history, consider the role of fundamentalist religion. Who would have imagined that the Scots embracing of a rigid and quite rabidly fundamentalist religion would lead, within barely two generations, to an explosion of ideas about individual and intellectual liberty that gained root in the founding documents of our country?<br />Why should we care? Does this book merely provide an alternate lens through which to view the distant history of a rather obscure people? If that were the case, we might just as well stick with the kilts and pipes. <br />I would argue, instead, that this book brings important ideas to very contemporary debates. I've often found sweeping critiques of capitilism, colonialism and imperialism to be compelling - critiques of \\"the west\\" which seem to root its failings in the very era which Herman celebrates and attributes to our worthy Scots. But the attacks of September 2001 have done much to crystallize these often merely academic debates. If the \\"critique of the west\\" finds its final roost in mass murder, one cannot so glibly embrace that censure. <br />Reading Herman's book I surprised myself by coming, for instance, to view Adam Smith's ideas in a substantially positive light. I gained a balance - a positive appreciation of what was added to the human species' ways of comprehending and organizing our habitation of the earth, of why it was honestly labeled an \\"enlightenment\\" in its day and how it might still inform our thinking about contesting the darkness of ours.<br />Does this view ignore past and present? colonialism? the depredations of GATT and NAFTA? Nah. But we sure do need more of a stance to stand up against these forces than identity politics; and we need more of an alternative than the return to pre-capitalist forms that is implicit in condemnation of the commercial revolution of the 18th century. Not for this Scot, anyways; no return to pipes or kilts - but also no return to mud huts and bloody servitude. We can gain much by acknowledging that the Enlightenment was a positive historical movement. Herman's thoughtful analysis of that movement, albeit through a plaid lens, re-invigorates history by reminding us how much we have to learn from its (re)-reading.	2003-01-16

You are going to read it.   And, if you are paddling the Amazon, here, you are going to buy and OWN it. The question really becomes which edition you should own.<br />This is the one.<br />Its a fine translation -  surprising in its avoidance of archaic language. It has a nice structure - the inevitable notes are available but not obtrusive.<br />It is also, this one, the Modern Library hardback edition, a nice book to own. It isn't one of those pretty faux-leather \\"shelf-candy\\" copies that'll break your wallet first. This is a hardworking book - the essence of the Modern Library idea. But it is a wonderful packaging of the whole 1000+ pages that is both readable and shelvable.  No thousand-page paperback will survive an actual reading as anything you would want excepting as backup next to the latrine.<br />Did I mention that it is a great book, great story? Well, others over the years have managed that :-). But I will loudly agree. I'm rereading it only now after a 35 year hiatus (yes, indeed, classics can be lost on the young - thats why you want books that last. In 35 more years, when you turn your lance back toward targets you thought you left behind, a copy will cost you [a lot of money]). It is just plain startling in its innovations and story. I always thought Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepard were the first to break down that \\"third wall\\" and talk to the audience - yet here is Cervantes doing so five centuries back ! Wow.<br />Even if you've been made to buy it and to read it, buy a nice copy. Read the \\"Cliff notes\\" if you must, but someday you'll be a crazy old coot like Don Q. (or me) and want to toss something more meaningful thanPalahniuk (or even Rushdie) at the cobwebs that cling.	2003-01-16

After that... overdone	I suppose that readers who finished Miles' prior book, \\"God: A Biography\\" will be equally captivated by this new title - a sequel of sorts. But if this is your first exposure to Miles' \\"literary God\\" you might find, as I did,  that your interest waxes, but quickly wanes. <br />The unusual approach he takes to his rather unique protagonist is really fascinating at first, but after a while it just wears out its welcome - a 30,000-word, tightly-edited piece in \\"The New Yorker\\" would have served the central idea better. While there is certainly a different artistic sensibility at work here, reading this book was something akin to watching \\"Rocky\\", then \\"Rocky II\\" and \\"III\\"  all in a row. A relatively powerful theme and a stylistically new framework beats you up through repetition in too many guises. Imagine \\"Brother, Where Art Thou II\\"<br />Its hard to figure out who would enjoy this book end-to-end, as obviously quite a few have. A deeply and more traditionally Christian readership will be simply appalled by the diminishment of the central elements of their faith to historico-literary plot requirements. An agnostic, humanist or simply atheist readership will be put off by Miles' clear deep faith in the underlying reality of the story. I suppose \\"lit crit\\" types could enjoy it, but by eschewing the academic dryness of their genre, this book also steps outside their focus and stands as an implicit criticism of the emptiness of that approach.<br />The idea is intriguing enough at first take - to treat the biblical \\"God\\" as a literary character. Trace his (no Goddess here!) ups and downs from the perspective of how his collective authorship struggled to recreate a protagonist consistent with their culture's own diminishment and the failure of earlier `chapters' to come true - eventually turning to the plot \\"twists\\" of the New Testament and the new character in the story, Christ.<br />But that collectivity or authorship was a source of one of my itching complaints that eventually had to be scratched. Why not just attribute the twists and turns of the main characters of this God story to the unusual fact that it was written over hundreds of years, and by authors in the thrall of faith and a belief that earlier \\"drafts\\" were holy writ ? That is, why not follow the more traditional analyses that consider either the theological or the historical growth and change of the idea of God ? Admittedly these have often been dryer than Sinai dust, but that only suggests that the real accomplishment of Miles is to tell the story a lot more engagingly - the David McCullough of a different era.<br />After all - how many literary characters have been created thus, by dozens of authors over centuries ?  It seems hardly the same thing as traditional character-based literary analysis - tracing the development in David Copperfield's or Silas Marner's personae over several hundred pages. Furthermore, Miles' tracings are rather sweeping. By the time I got to the chapter exploring the plumbing of Christ's sexuality I was at about the same point I would be if a similar book were exploring Huck Finn's unstated masturbatory life! Unless lit crit is your field, such tracings can hardly hold your interest as much as the stories themselves. Eventually the distinctiveness of the approach loses its freshness and starts to seem silly. A frankly good-old-fashioned fiction such as Mailer's or Saramago's is ultimately more satisfying.	2002-03-10

How can I start a review of the book that captured me into poetry? that led me to actually read and enjoy Dante and Milton? that even led me to reading odd epic poems and novels in verse that rarely make it into the top million rank here on Amazon? <br />How about \\"Great book - a life-changer in wholly unexpected ways.\\"<br />I got my copy gratis back when I was doing occasional book reviews of the more traditional sort and not the slightest bit interested in the slender wisps of poetry that crossed my desk. There was something different about this one, though.  This was five pounds of poetry ! Five-hundred and sixty pages ? One poem? How could that be? WHAT could that be? <br />But you've got to decide whether to spend a few bucks here, your situation is different. So the real question is what brought YOU to this page in Amazon. Needless to say, my five-star rating means that I will try to convince all comers to read \\"Sandover\\",  but you must realize that you are a rather lonely explorer to have come this far. Your path reveals the nature of your search.<br />Maybe you've read some of Merrill's other work from the recent, rather successful \\"Collected Poems\\". Wonderful! While the critics can tell you about commonalties in all those poems, you probably noticed more of the vast range in that collection: from the tiny, surgically incisive \\"Little Fallacy\\", to the weirdly evocative \\"Lost in Translation\\" (bet you read that one more than once), to the extended, languorous narrative of \\"The Summer People\\", to the challenging and often enigmatic mythos in \\"From the Cupola.\\" <br />This wholly different last pair, my favorites, were unexpectedly conjoined as the only two poems in the UK-published early book entitled \\"Two Poems.\\" Together, they hint best at what \\"Sandover\\" will deliver: carefully crafted narrative and delight in poetic form along with intellectually challenging and sometimes cryptic layering. Expect some strangeness wrapped in a reassuring pale, cream cape, until the cape is tossed back to reveal a startlingly, spookily omni-dimensional vision. Sounds like fun ? Jump in... <br />I guess it's possible that you came here after reading Alison Lurie's recent lurid little \\"literary memoir.\\" If so, congratulations for stepping over that indelicate little pile to consider the man's most epic work, instead of a shrewish listing of his peccadilloes.  Of course personality and autobiography inevitably fuel poetry, and Merrill's \\"Sandover\\" is no exception. You might even, legitimately wonder, as I did, how the poetry of a rich gay man, who sounds suspiciously like an aesthete of the flightiest sort in Lurie (and apparently had a weird, mystic streak) can do anything more than entertain you. And how is that possible for 560 pages ?<br />You won't find the glib and thoughtless dilettante of Lurie's portrayal lurking beneath \\"Sandover.\\" Merrill was not an overtly autobiographical poet, but he collected the pieces and wrote the tale of Sandover through 20-odd years of his life, In doing so he revealed the reality of privilege without arrogance, mysticism within a wry skepticism, and appreciation of love and beauty in all their forms. \\"Sandover\\" is actually a fine place for one who is neither gay, nor rich, nor mystical and, perhaps, like me, aesthetically-challenged, to get drawn-in to a world that twines these elements together in an endlessly interesting and attractive way. If you've read Lurie, I think you will find \\"Sandover\\" an especial pleasure - a much more graciously framed journey toward much more extraordinary horizons.<br />I suppose you might be here because you have developed a taste for the long poem: the epic or the novel in verse (maybe from my own `listmania' list of such works right here on Amazon). If so, you face a more interesting challenge. \\"Sandover\\" will offer many things that are familiar but probably some quite different. If the story in Vikram Seth's \\"Golden Gate\\" captivated you, you will find a quite compelling story here - but not one quite so down-to-earth. If the different cultures circumscribed by Walcott's \\"Omeros\\" or even Budbill's \\"Judevine\\" intrigued you, you will find other worlds here - otherworldly locales, indeed.. If  Merwin's \\"Folding Cliffs\\" satisfied while it challenged you as a reader, you will find \\"Sandover\\" to be a surprising combination of the eminently readable and the multi-layered and re-readable. If Dante's, Milton's or even Frederick Turner's epic reach inspired you, you can count on \\"Sandover\\" to take you to the inner and outer reaches of the universe.<br />Finally, of course, you might be here just because you've heard that James Merrill was one of the finest poets of the 20th century. He was. In \\"Sandover\\" he combined many, many talents - as a formalist and as an experimenter in form and as one of the last poets to show a pure delight in words and their infective enlodgement in the human brain. The atomics of the poem satisfy and surprise no matter what magnification your readerly microscope is set on. Over and over you will find yourself startled at a just plain perfect piece of short verse - as tersely powerful as William's \\"red wheelbarrow.\\" Then you will find yourself so captured by the narrative of the story, that only part-way through will you realize that you are in the midst of two pages of elegant \\"terza rima.\\" Even the largest structural elements partition,  loop-back and break off in ways that build a magnificent whole that is as captivating in its large-scale structure as in its single word choices.<br />Sandover is an endlessly captivating work - I've read it, all 560 pages, four times in ten years, and still pick it up and read a section or two every few months.	2002-03-01

This book does list values of 25,000 books as it claims, but it is incomplete in some very frustrating ways that have to do with how it was put together. The authors apparently contacted a number of book dealers and collected their 'inventories' into a database. These were then consolidated into the listing(s) of this book.<br />But what that means is that you find an extremely unsystematic selection of titles. You may find a $500 title that someone has been trying to sell for years right above a run-of-the-mill used-bookstore title selling for $15. You could find an author's second book listed, but not the first or third. As a lookup/reference tool is is hardly useful.<br />I once thought this book would be a nice supplement to the other collecting books that focus on more high-end titles... something to take along to yard sales and the like to see if the $0.25 book was 'worth' $50 or $0.50. Well, even with 25,000 titles you can imagine that many more books are not listed here. Far too often I would not find a listing but COULD NOT KNOW if the book was valuable or not... its non-existence in this book just means one of the selected sellers did not have it in stock. I also kept finding entries in the $25/$30 range - right at the point where it might be a collectable underlisted by that one store or just their overpriced junk. With only a single such listing to consider, I just couldn't know.<br />The overlarge physical size of the book also seemed unwieldy to me. Combined with the sense of slap-together technique and a look at the number of other \\"Huxfords\\" listings, I frankly feel that it is just an attempt to grab a piece of the growing 'collectibles' market.	2002-02-13

Having finished it, though, I was left with a lasting impression of a unique character, an unusual narrator and a powerful story. Perhaps it was the lack of a stern prod this time around, but I didn't get past the first quarter of \\"Ahab's Wife\\" and never developed the slightest interest in the characters or their fates.<br />It's certainly true, as other reviews have said, that the authorial \\"agenda\\" leaks through to stain the pages - a somewhat feminist or woman-centered story built on what I guess is called a 'post-modernist' worldview. But thats a worldview that I'm not altogether uncomfortable with - I don't think it was that which turned me off. And the writing is talented enough, I suppose - in a somewhat overblown way (that I thought was intended to mimic Melville.)<br />I'd have to say that the characterizations, within the given historical context, were just plain unbelievable in the end. If this had been written as a piece of future fiction such as Atwood's \\"Handmaid's Tale\\" it might have come off better in that department. There is something peculiar about attributing some elements of 'modernism' or 'post-modernism' to peoples of the last centuries... peculiar and not especially believable. This question - of how much of modern sentiment to inject into pre-modern characters - is probably the hardest part to balance with historical fiction. I think most good historical fiction seeks to tell a story about the times. This book seemed more intent, instead on making a point within the trappings of a story.	2002-02-13

But with about 4 months of intensive collecting and study under my belt, I found it not to have too much new or really useful information. Is is, however, very well written and engaging enough that I read the entire book. If you are starting at a slower pace than I did or if you are just thinking about becoming a book collector this is a fine place to start. It has chapter-length overviews of all the important realms and activities of book-collecting. The only weak-spot, but an important one, is in the area of internet books. In being about 2-3 years behind, it is not an adequate introduction to the range of online resources available to the new collector.<br />Most useful was a list of &quot;1001 more-or-less collectible books&quot; listed by author at the back. (Lacking years of experience, such lists are critical for my reference). This is a useful thing to have around at book sales and the like (along with a good guide to first editions) although not especially wieldy as provided. I found that I finally photocopied the entire section in half-size and ended up with a more useful 5-6 page foldup that I could carry in my pocket. Note that this last section is NOT a price-guide and is not especially discriminatory... for many authors their rarest first book is listed along with much less collectible later works (and since the listings are alphabetical by title, rather than chronological by publication date, you will not be able to use it for parsing-out &quot;first books&quot;.<br />Overall a useful starting resource but one that you will rarely use once your collecting becomes a more serious affair.	2002-02-13

Collectors will find the never-to-be-obtained rarities listed (entertaining to look up) but also the more attainable first editions in the $50-$500 range. This is a big book to lug along to a sale but, believe it or not, an enjoyable browse and a fine way for the aspiring collector to see which authors are more collectible.<br />This book is NOT three things - reminders that the serious collector must, inevitably, accept the need for a number of references which will have some overlap.<br />It is not a guide to identifying first editions - often a challenge for the large number of pubishers who do not clearly indicate 1st ed status. For this I'd highly recommend McBride's pocket guide.  It also isn't really a guide to \\"modern\\" first editions, at least those that are in the $30-$100 value range. You may find Uris or Ludlum's first two books here but not their 3rd or 5th. It MAY make a difference to you whether such a title is really worth the $30 a dealer is charging. For these books I recommend Lee's \\"20th Century First Edition Fiction.\\" It is not merely a listing of authors' first books, although it includes those... for that, and a wider range of midprice authors, their \\"Book Collecting 2000\\" is great. .....<br />Once you know what the book is not, you can determine if it is for you. The five-star rating applies to those buyers with a serious interest in collecting (or thinking about collecting) the roughly 20,000 most valued books. It includes all the good stuff. Where necessary it lists details of  first-edition \\"points\\", the subtle details of identification that, for some books, distinguish earlier from later states. Alternate editions such as American and UK or limited or special editions are also priced separately.  It is a useful, even entertaining, reference for the serious collector. Someday the online databases and searchengines may supplant references like this (I do use them more often) but if you're a bibliophile your prime reference on books just has to be a book.	2002-02-13
US	52912007	R3JMDYEUG86F96	0813913578	209035651	Beauty: The Value of Values	Books	4	17	23	N	N	Beauty's beast	I imagine readers will be wandering toward this intriguing book by way of some very different roots. Some, although not I, may be drawn to the implicit neo-political message in its subtitle, &quot;The Value of Values.&quot; Perhaps having read your William Bennett you seek a more austere, academically flavored approach to moral absolutism. I don't think you'll find it here, but I wouldn't be surprised if the complexity (or is it ambiguity) of Turner's message didn't allow ideologues of the moralist right to snatch up this book to wave in the other free hand.<br />I came to this book after having discovered a very unusual book-length work of epic poetry. A rare enough form in itself these days, but this epic takes the further genre-bending leap of representing its story in the future, as &quot;sci-fi.&quot; The epic poem is &quot;The New World&quot; and, as you might have surmised, the author is Frederick Turner. I guess it figures. Consider the readership problem. An epic poem may capture about 10% of the already small poetry-reading cohort, then one has to slice away another 90% of that often rather snooty crew as disdaining the sci-fi genre. A writer would have to have some sort of &quot;big idea&quot; fuel to drive such a thankless and relatively readerless endeavor. Turner has (many) such ideas!<br />Turner believes there are cross-cultural, cross-temporal universals, one of which is that which he shamelessly calls &quot;beauty.&quot; You might note your own reaction to that title (or the thought of reading the book openly on a bus ? better a Danielle Steele). In choosing the more vernacular term, Turner purposely steps around the academic doo-doo that has become &quot;aesthetics&quot; while pursuing a rather academic task - defining beauty and bolstering the claim for absolutes in the process.<br />I'm not sure if he succeeds. <br />One intriguing link he makes, drawn rather extensively, is that between beauty and shame - notice another word one rarely sees indiscussions outside the psych department. Beauty, he suggests, lies at a boundary between the dark and the light - shame energizes that interface for humans, fueling a historically tumultuous dynamic. <br />Casting a sidereal light on recent events he suggests:<br />&quot;We can tell ideological pity from true pity by the killing.<BR>Once the killing starts, another feedback mechanism springs into being; our shame at our crimes is denied, and transformed into further hatred, which must be slaked by further crime... This is the essential mechanism of the phenomenon of Terror.&quot;<br />Wow... &quot;where's did beauty go?&quot;, you might ask. Well I can only say that the power of Turner's argument probably stems from his walking the sharp edge between dark and light and that one chosen quote represents the style and the energy of his approach if not its breadth. <br />Turner's discussion, I must add, are not a-political. He is certainly aware of the political content that lies within a head-on challenge to &quot;modernism&quot; and relativism. He also goes ahead and steps into the busy and dangerous highway of intellectual discourse by claiming that the development of the notion of left-right political dichotomy itself is at the core of the shames which have driven our culture away from the beautiful. Once again, the Bennett-ites will leap in to place a heavy hand around Turner's shoulders, but I think he would shrug it off. (Not being a student of cultural history I wonder that this 1991 book must already have had its reaction within intellectual circles and for all I know Turner is co-authoring books about what your 2nd grader needs to know... don't think so, though). <br />He is careful to develop the notion that his idea of beauty-lost is not necessarily a toga-party; not just a revival of a Greco-Roman canonical corpse. His references, such as they are, are smattered with non-western elements which build a broader base for that-which-is-lost than Bennett and the gang.<br />But its in the references department that I found the book wanting. As a lengthy essay it is very thought-provoking. But Turner suggests throughout that his notion of the &quot;absolute&quot; part of the argument is built upon recent discoveries about human brains and consciousness. Perhaps it is - but he drops nary a single footnote or reference (or even a slender bibliography) for the inquiring mind; and thus leaves, in the end, a certain doubt about the grounding of his ideas. If, like me, you have rooted some of your own thinking and reading about human existence around writers like Daniel Dennett (or even Morris Berman), you will feel cheated knowing that such scientific grounding doubtless exists and could have been bundled into this bouquet.<br />Ah well, you can't have everything (or five stars).

This book came highly recommended to me via Tom Disch's book, \\"The Castle of Indolence\\", a wonderful compilation of commentaries on poetry. I was, and am, especially interested in the long poem as a unique form, and this \\"Novel in Verse\\" seemed worth a look.     \\"History: The Home Movie\\" intends to take an under-the-covers, yellowing underbelly view of a history which includes the intersection of the author's family and that of Boris Pasternak through the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries.  Rather than the grand sweep of events and armies we are offered a look through the refracted lens of personal peccadillo and hidden, twisted lives. An interesting prospect which did not carry this reader past the halfway mark.    The difficulty that I found was twofold.  The reader needs to be well-versed in the details of lifestyles and events during that era in history. Raine's cryptic and rather chopped poetic language is evocative but peppered with period references that simply eluded me - in large part because of what was presumably left out to satisfy the muse. Furthermore, you need a chart to keep track of the characters and their various Russian nicknames and given names and cousins and friends. I'm not kidding ! There really is a chart; a pair of family-trees adorn the frontspiece. Perhaps they warn that the author realized at some point that the language and story themselves would not manage to support the superstructure of the characters as individuals or to define their interrelationships.    SO... you will find yourself reading a segment which takes the point of view of one whom you eventually realize is some sort of doctor who you eventually realize (if your bag of historic detail is loaded up) is doing the mummification of Lenin that left him preserved for generations of Soviets to view under glass. That time I \\"got it\\", but I plowed through many other sections thinking I would understand what was going on if only I had paid more attention to my Doestotevsky.The end result, perhaps intended, but not satisfying, is more of an Ashbery'ish walk through shards of history which sometimes, briefly, clump into nodes of meaning or reference, but otherwise only provide a broad music. Verse, perhaps but not a novel.	2001-12-17

It leaves the catsup'y-trite bluster of the typical Hollywood slasher pic in the dust. And it is Hughes who accomplishes this through his translation. Perhaps saying \\"story by Aeschulus\\" is not offering the old-timer his due... doubtless, when read in the Greek, the original had the flash and spurt of Hughes' version. But lacking the ancient tongue you'll find some pretty tame translations scattered around the cannon. I know, I checked. (I was so stunned at one of the more brutal story elements that I went to a library copy. Sure enough, Agamemnon's father really did stew his brothers' children and serve them up to his brother - brewing up the similarly brutal chain of revenge and recriminations that the story revolves around. But in the library's vanilla version this segment read more like a particularly dry autopsy report).<br />Now I can be drawn into a gory tale by a good talespinner like a Stephen King just as much as any other guy... but there is more than spinning of yarn and sloshing of blood here. There is a way in which Hughes' inevitably modern take on the translation subtly exposes the deep cultural differences between those fine ancient peoples and our equally-fine selves. We haven't become more or less vicious or more or less clever - but we have changed in fundamental ways. This tale, in this telling, does suggest, over and over, how a culture's sense of self, of free- or enchained-will, of god(s), and of the inevitable whirl of the cosmic wheel can produce truly different constituents. Different versions of the \\"God-meme\\" or even the \\"self-meme\\" can deeply infect and transform a culture-centered species like ours.<br />We've heard for so long how our \\"Western\\" tradition sprouts from Athens, but in this telling, those folks have a sense of their place in the universe which is deeply, subtly alien. It made me think of a long ago reading of Julian Jaynes' breathtakingly-titled: \\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bi-Cameral Mind.\\", which posits that ancient minds were explicitly pre-conscious... gods as literally heard voices in the head. This is certainly an odd idea, but one that opens up the notion that radically different kinds of minds could well exist in a homo sapiens transport system.<br />Hughes delivers this sense of the fundamental other-ness of the Greek world-view through the powerful mix of pre-modern sense of self and of justice delivered in modern speech forms. This contrast builds, appropriately, from the underlying story of Aeschulus, to the confrontation with the deeply primal Furies near the end. It sent chills down my spine to hear their rendering of the cold heartless core of their universe... and to contrast it with the countering argument of Athena for a more reasoned and rational justice. How can Orestes be driven to matricide by the command of one god (buttressed by hair-raising threats) and then be condemned to an even more bitter doom by another group of immortals for accomplishing his mission? The degree to which my own sense of fairness was bruised by the events leading up to this denouement exposed the power of the schism between primal and modern that seems to lie at the heart of the tale.<br />I won't tell you how it ends, but that's saying something! A thousands-of-years-old story in free verse dramatic form that turns out to be a 'page-turner'! Its a wonderful discovery that will lead me next to Hughes' other translations from his last few years, and might grab you as well.own of the Bi-Cameral Mind.\\", which posits that ancient minds were explicitly pre-conscious... gods as literally heard voices in the head.

US	52912007	RPCRY868CG767	0571139671	376586458	The Golden Gate	Books	5	31	36	N	Y	Anne Tyler walzing with Pushkin... a surprise, a delight	This book is one of a nearly extinct breed: a novel in verse. In that form lie its unique pleasures as well as its uncertain reception at some hands. <br />The poet James Merrill, in his epic trilogy &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; has claimed that &quot;forms what affirms&quot;. Does this mean that the satisfaction of the novel can only come if the line-breaks are reliably marginal? Linguists Whorf and Sapir have suggested that language constrains our thought - not so much in the realm of vocabulary as, again, in that of form. The radically different forms of, for instance, Hopi or Inuit constrain &quot;what is relatively easy to say&quot; and hence, what is said. Perhaps so. You'd expect that rhyming sonnets would constrain the voice of a novelist, but Vikram Seth has certainly shown here that is not necessarily the case. Chalk it up to a mastery of both form and story, though, not to versification. His technical skills extend to both realms.<br />Moving, then, beyond form, we wonder about content of such a novel. Will the book wander (or waltz) into the deeply allegorical, the disconnected, the imagistic? After all, aren't those the consequences of poetic license? Have you read your Ashbery? Oddly, this poem is quite prosaic in that regard, it tells a tight, comprehensible story in a manner that is fluid but not embroidered. (By way of contrast, consider that you can easily find yourself spinning away in a vortex of magical metaphor in the latest Rushdie.) Novels, it would seem, are pretty much what we make of them. As one who has never really appreciated the modernist redesign of the novel, I found &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; to be a much more satisfying story - notwithstanding its several-hundred sonnets.<br />The book is a well-textured story about a number of folks living their lives and relationships - apparently in the 80's. (Some reviewers have made much of the story's use of timestamped phraseology such as the use of &quot;yuppie&quot; and thelike. Perhaps. But I'd imagine that the term &quot;Okie&quot; was equally a well-understood, sometimes overloaded, term of the 30's which we, nevertheless, can comfortably accept from Steinbeck.) The lives, loves and trials of these folks are presented with the careful painting and pacing of Anne Tyler and J. R. Lennon. <br />Seth's verse in this book has been called &quot;masterful&quot;. It is, indeed. Consider that the odd rhyme is hardly ever at hand for most of us, much less available when called upon, as he was, thousands of times. But Seth is more than a rhymer - something I noticed by contrast. I'm pretty sure the sonnet scheme he uses is the so-called &quot;Pushkin rhyme.&quot; I only know this since I just struggled through a marginal translation of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; and noticed the similarity. But the sing-songy'ness of the Pushkin was gladly lacking in the Seth. He uses true poetic craft, line breaks and punctuation and word choice, to allow the reader to flow between a fluid, songlike verse and a more prosaic tale-telling. In other words, he uses the strengths of both forms when they serve, best, the needs of the work and the reader. <br />So. Don't be afraid of the form. But also don't expect it to seem natural unless you have seen it before. I came to this book via a recommendation of Tom Disch in his essays in &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot; (a 5-star plug there), and from a background in having sought out and read quite a number of long poems, epic poems and verse novels. <br />If you taste this book more out of curiosity than experience, good for you! But grant yourself the time to bounce through the first dozen sonnets in the singy-songy phrasing that so many of us learned to be necessarily poetic many years ago. Then, as the story captures you, you will notice that the verse, with the help of Seth's subtle crafting, both lifts and disappears beneath the story. I'll read it again, and again.	2001-12-06

When I realize I want to read a book again even as I am finishing the first pass, I know I'm on to something meaty. When I find myself passing on a good poetry book to read something &quot;heavy&quot;, I've got to wonder what's up. When that 'something' is centered on concepts I thought I already understood, I know I have a uniquely valuable read on my hands. Those all describe my experience of reading &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea&quot; by Daniel Dennett and could well describe your experience of this magnificent book.<br />I came to this book from an eye-opening read of Dennett's earlier &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;. So I knew I was dealing with a thinker who could grapple with the loftiest ideas in an engaging but challenging manner. I have not been disappointed here.<br />If, like me, you have read Dawkins, read E.O. Wilson, read Pinker -- even read Darwin, you will be doubly hooked by this book. How can such established ideas be reframed in such startling new formulations ?<br />Dennett manages with a style that is relaxed but endlessly intricate and deeply integrated with some of the most central ideas of philosophy and human thought. This book is not a review of Darwinian theory or a rehash of it. It is, instead a powerful characterization of the truly dangerous recognition that Darwin's central ideas can be seen to spread exploratory tendrils into virtually every area of human thought and of life on this planet.<br />In the same way that a silhouette depicts a person by contrasting subject to field, Dennett uncaps the unexpected dangerousness of Darwin's idea by exploring the many ways in which even its apparent staunch supporters have recoiled from the final implications of a theory of natural selection. We shrink from acknowledging the ultimate truth that meaning can arise from meaninglessness, that order can be a consequence of mere mindless algorithm, that even our precious 'selves' exist simply as links in a chain slowly coiling through time andspace.<br />Newton wasn't about apples. Freud wasn't about sex. Darwin isn't about apes. The former pair reshaped our descriptions of our inner and outer spaces. Darwin's idea is shown here to be doubly revolutionary because it extends to both realms. Given replicators - whether they be genes or cultural constructs termed 'memes' - and given limited resources and a competition for them - whether for sunlight or human brainspace - an inevitable, &quot;mindless&quot; algorithm will create those things that we wish to call order and meaning (and selves).<br />As critters who have always tended to imagine that we have somehow stepped outside the foul-lines of the Darwinian ball park, that our uniqueness exists in other lofty realms, some of us are repelled by the us-lessness at the center of such a perspective. But we can also find a strange comfort in the deep reaches of such a simple, sweeping idea as well. If you've ever stood cursing at the onslaughts of stormy weather and suddenly just stopped - to chuckle or gasp or just stare - you've felt the power of stepping outside that meaning game. In a world where so many seek the gut-ease of the viral 'memes' of fundamentalist meaning, one realizes that a universe that just &quot;is&quot; has a lot to say for it.	2001-12-03

I did so cautiously, since one negative review here specifically claimed the same buying &quot;path&quot;. Not so for me. &quot;Book Collecting 2000&quot; is excellent for my needs and might be for you as well.<br />I was nudged into active book collecting when I found an author's first edition of her first novel hidden in a book sale stack. For $3 I came to own a $300 book. But it wasn't simple. Although I had heard of the author, I did not recognize the book as her &quot;first.&quot; Only a quick jaunt home to check some online listings confirmed its value. I anxiously returned to the sale hoping the book was still there... couldn't find it at first ! Someone had picked it up and then returned out of alphabetical order!<br />As a relatively new collector I just don't have the experience to always ID a &quot;first book&quot;. <br />&quot;Book Collecting 2000&quot; supplies an ENORMOUS LISTING of first books (350+ pages out of 520) - with roughly 5000 entries. You can study it or bring it to a sale with you. The listings show estimated values from the 1986, 1995 and 2000 editions of the book and provide some cues about what sorts of books are gaining value at especially surprising rates.<br />In addition, the listings often supply additional information and &quot;points&quot; about the &quot;firsts.&quot; This is, for example, the first general-use reference in which I've seen the dustjacket cover of John LeCarre's (1962)US first, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot;, accurately described (&quot;white dustwrapper&quot;). Before buying &quot;Book Collecting 2000&quot; I had already invested $2 at another sale in a nice blue and tan version that turned out to be a stealth book club edition... disappointing but really a rather inexpensive way to learn what a &quot;blindstamp&quot; actually looks like!<br />Yes - this book is mostly lists, as the other negative review claimed. But I found all of them to be useful, especially so when combined into one source. These lists include Pulitzer, Hugo and PEN winners and the like, but also a very handy listing of author pseudonyms, nicely sorted alphabetically by both actual and pen name. An appendix contains a brief listing of publishers' formats for indicating first editions - it seems adequate but I have to admit that I still prefer my pocket-sized McBride for that. The &quot;front material&quot; (roughly 100 pages) is a decent overview of the wide range of information that a new collector needs to absorb. I think the Ellis book does a better job of this piece. But that just means I recommend buying both.<br />I now take this book with me to every sale!	2001-08-04

I only recently discovered James Ellroy with his &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and I loved it - see my 5-star review here on Amazon. But this follow-up work seems fundamentally flawed.<br />Ellroy has taken a narrow slice from the wide range of techniques he employed in &quot;Tabloid&quot; - the staccato burst from a clip of short sentences - and used it almost exclusively here. In &quot;Tabloid&quot; it served to offset a certain tone or frame of mind for a character. Here it never stops, wearing away at your willingness to persevere as a reader the same way a machine-gun shreds a paper target. Overkill.<br />I was also struck by the artificiality of the means used to create storyline continuity for the characters hatched and molded in &quot;Tabloid.&quot; The staccato approach can hardly fill-in such gaps. Instead we are treated to an overuse of another styling from &quot;Tabloid&quot;: the pseudo-memo. These &quot;Directors Eyes Only&quot; notes and the like, to or from the FBI's Hoover or the protagonists, are stretched overlong to catch the reader up to speed on character's history and motives generated in the earlier work. The quirky tone established for Hoover and some other characters in &quot;Tabloid&quot; is blurred by this approach.<br />Finally, I have to say that the character epiphanies that concluded &quot;Tabloid&quot; seemed a little lame back then. But after such a sustained 200 mph run through the dark side of the American soul a few neat wraps did not distract. Here, in &quot;Cold Six Thousand&quot;, I find the 'remodeled' characters from &quot;Tabloid&quot; strangely two-dimensional in contrast to their earlier forms. Some of them, (e.g. Howard Hughes) are just too weird for too long - what was fascinating is just odd by the second book. Some of them seem wholly transformed between the ending of &quot;Tabloid&quot; on the afternoon of 11/22/63 and the beginning of this book just a few hours later.<br />If you've read &quot;American Tabloid&quot;I think this book will disappoint you as it did me. If you haven't read the former, much of &quot;Cold Six Thousand&quot; will seem just peculiar and flat... don't judge Ellroy by this flatness - set this one aside and read &quot;Tabloid&quot; instead.	2001-07-23

What great news to hear that Howard Zinn and the New Press are creating a &quot;People's History&quot; series! <br />Even better news is the outstanding job Ray Raphael has done of this first effort in that series. He has taken on the overall approach of the 'original', Zinn's &quot;People's History of the United States&quot; and applied it to the &quot;creation myths&quot; of our country in a way that creates real history which is captivating even as it strips the gloss from the schoolboy history handed on for generations.<br />The really nice thing is that Raphael has accomplished this with a voice that is unique to himself and to this book. No mere expansion of a chapter from the earlier Zinn book, this. Even having read Zinn's book, I found that this one retained the same ability to amaze me with fundamental reexamination of core beliefs.<br />At its center this book is, more than anything else, a study of how revolution happens. As such it is important reading for anyone who considers how fundamental change might happen in this country, if ever, again. The real myth of our history is not so much the focus on individual heroics or great battles as the implicit claim that our revolution fell into place so neatly, so quickly. Somewhere between chapters 3 and 5 in our history books the Brits passed some taxes, the Colonists rose up in righteous indignation, the battle was at hand - then won.<br />Raphael demonstrates at length, through original sources created by regular folks, that the whole business was much longer work than that. People don't just rise up overnight, casting off habits of mind and cultural expectations of what can and cannot be done. People don't just sit down and pen some pamphlets or high-sounding declarations and raise armies. <br />This book shows how, over decades, a broad sweep of reaction against oppressive institutions by everyday people built a solid groundwork which meant that the final &quot;revolution&quot; was neither unexpected norun-practiced. He describes how many earlier uprisings, revolts, and proto-revolutions radicalized the populace and eroded assumptions about rights of elites. He describes how the vast majority of disenfranchised poor played a fundamental role in shifting those assumptions.<br />Throughout he reminds us of what a complicated business it was. From the broad in scope - the impossibility of raising a standing army from reluctant and other-committed farmers and family men, (and the consequential injection of a military draft and a messy cash-buyout business) to the narrow - why the \\"tea party\\" energized so many common folk to whom tea was the ultimate class icon.<br />Thoughtful people have learned to be skeptical of delivered history. But it really helps to have something real to counterbalance mere skepticism. This history is real, this is eye-opening stuff, this is the rest of the story.	2001-07-23

I was well past starting to think that the best parts of Pickover's books were the always-intriguing titles. I had started a number of these in the past, but usually ended up skimming or setting them aside. None that I have read would have earned more than 3 stars. Until now!<br />&quot;Wonders of Numbers&quot; is, somehow, different. It still has some of his quirky lists (&quot;The Unabomber's 10 Most Mathematical Technical Papers&quot;, &quot;A Ranking of the 5 Strangest Mathematicians Who Ever Lived&quot;). It still has the intriguing titles - each of 125 &quot;chapters&quot; carries one, ranging from &quot;The Pipes of Papua&quot; to &quot;Anchovy Marriage Test&quot;. The pieces still seem to jump all over the place. Most of these things didn't grab me in past Pickover titles. Here, they all fit together and work nicely.<br />Oddly enough, I think the appeal of this volume might be its eclecticism. Pickover is not trying to create a whole story as he has in some earlier books (&quot;Time: A Traveler's Guide&quot;, &quot;Surfing through Hyperspace&quot;). The unifying center of this book is, simply, mathematics and the myriad ways it exposes its wonders to us. I'm guessing that the reason I haven't put this one down is my own fascination with mathematics itself. The broader the scope the better - and none takes a wider view than Clifford Pickover. The book has something for everyone - but it will also draw you in to other pieces you thought you weren't interested in. Martin Gardner meets Conway &amp; Guy ! A nice combo.	2001-07-23

Different translations will suit different tastes.<br />This classic translation of Dante's trilogy remains one of the best. It nicely preserves the musicality of the original by retaining the \\"terza rima\\" rhyme scheme throughout. This may seem like a narrow point but it makes this a satisfying read for one who enjoys rhyme. Terza rima is an ABA, BCB, CDC... arrangement of triplets where the first and third lines rhyme and the middle line's rhyme becomes the first of the next triplet - simple but not sing-song. Over a poem of this length it helps to weave an amazing fabric of rhyme and story.<br />In the original Italian, a language with only a handful of primary word endings, such an approach was not the central challenge of a poetic work - Dante gets credit for the vision and scope. The challenge for translators is whether to preserve the content or the rhyme more closely; the English language is not comfortably suited for such relentless rhyming. Ciardi has, nevertheless, done a wonderful job of this. As to the other element, I've been told that the \\"story\\" is a tad \\"creative\\" at times. Perhaps Dante would object a few times if he reread this translation, but I found Ciardi's telling well crafted.<br />This edition combines all three parts of the \\"Comedy\\" in a nice, clothbound package. You might end up owning other translations of Dante (I have three), but you should certainly own this one.	2001-07-18
US	52912007	RWZF9KC0D3RDP	0062732765	149070062	Flatland/Sphereland (Everyday Handbook)	Books	5	118	123	N	Y	An excellent edition of a classic - extended	If you are not familiar with Edwin Abbott's &quot;Flatland&quot;, this is the edition to buy. If you are familiar with it (but presumably do not yet own it), this is still the edition to buy.<br />You've heard the classic criticism of a story is that it is &quot;two dimensional&quot;. Well, Edwin Abbott's tale of an imaginary two-dimensional land adds a whole new twist to that phrase. Flatland, as he describes it, is about as rich as a two-dimensional story can be. And it is marvelously extended by its narrator's encounters with the unknown - the world of 3 dimensions. The challenges that narrator faces as he encounters the incomprehensible, quite closely mirror mine whenever I attempt to think about a 4th (or 5th or 7th) dimension. If you've faced the same struggle, you will be delighted by this book.<br />If you've ever wondered what a 4th dimension would look like, Flatland provides a lens through which you can imagine that extension of our 3D world. From here you can go on to read Rudy Rucker or Pickover or Hawkins - but this is the place to start your exploration of dimensions beyond experience. Abbot accomplishes this by describing the eye-opening extension of his narrator's 2D world when visited by a 3D apparition, a &quot;sphere&quot;. His framing of the foundational issues through the experiences of what you'd expect to be the least interesting character in fiction are really quite engaging. The storyline, however sparse, is as interesting as the mathematics - albeit quite nineteenth-century'ish in tone.<br />Don't misconstrue Abbott's seemingly misogynist portrayal of women and of his class-stratified society. This element was intended to provide a third layer of sharp, Swiftian satire and critical commentary on the rigid social mores of his era. Abbot succeeds in this (but I, nevertheless, decided not to read it aloud to my 6th grade classes - worrying that they might not be attuned to this subtlety of tone.) Be forewarned. <br />The neat twist of this edition, the inclusion of Dionys Burger's 1983 &quot;Sphereland&quot;, as an upside-down &quot;second book&quot;, is quite a nice touch. Although I did not find Burger's stylings quite as engaging as those of Abbott, his extension of the mathematical ideas into non-Euclidian spaces is a nice introduction to that idea for non-mathematicians. Since it was intended as a standalone book, \\"Sphereland\\" commences with a detailed review of the \\"Flatland\\" story. This can be skipped without loss but is not a substitute for reading the original \\"Flatland\\", here, first.<br />Flatland is a timeless classic; a great book for the mathematician and non-mathematician alike.	2001-07-18

They are kind of like the &quot;dark matter&quot; that physicists say binds the universe together and either explains its eventual collapse or infinite expansion. The scientists can't find it, but their equations say it must be there.<br />If you've ever studied the \\"equations\\" that describe the circumstances and involved parties leading up to the first Kennedy assassination, you've probably felt like those physicists. Was it a Mafia hit? Was it rogue CIA elements? Castro? This book is Oliver Stone on PCP. It has all the characters (The Mob, CIA, Cuban exiles, Hoover, Hoffa, Castro, JFK &amp; RFK), and all the darkest themes that have been suggested to link them together and to the events leading up to 11/22/63. <br />\\"American Tabloid\\" is a tightly wound fiction that says, in the end, that it was all of them, and somehow none of them. It was an inevitable intersection of individuals and institutions deranged by their own willingness to do anything to attain and hold power.<br />Don't read the book if you idolize JFK. Don't expect Agatha Christie dialogue.  It wraps a staccato style around a collection of truly depraved individuals. It's a credit to the weird energy of that style, and to Ellroy, that he somehow draws us toward its twisted central characters. The same unwholesome urge that moves your foot to the brake when you pass a bad accident will have you staying up too late reading.

They seemed to be highly acclaimed, and I bought this title based on that reputation and some strong reviews here at Amazon.<br />I have to say I disagree. There are just no \\"AHA!\\" moments in the book - an element that I enjoy myself in recreational mathematics and seek to bring to my math classroom. I wholly expected the Holmes metaphor to create some captivating mathematical mysteries  with more than a few twists. Instead I found leaden storylines and transparent mathematics.<br />I can't guarantee this complaint because, uncharacteristically, I haven't finished the book (and probably won't); I have so far only read two of the \\"stories.\\"  I found the first one,  which ought to be the \\"hook\\", to be absolutely flat... nada. Holmes explained a not-especially-intriguing concept of logic or probability to Watson and then stated it again and again and again as they move through some inconsequential action in an uninteresting narrative. Right to the end I kept waiting for the clever twist - in vain. I sighed and set the book aside, then, and did not plan to read any more. Of course there's nothing like having already paid for a book to bring one back to it. The second piece, exploring some rather counter-intuitive elements of probability that many gamblers fall prey to was a tad more engaging - but not close to gripping.<br />Bruce seems to have the Holmes'ian character and language down pretty well. So what? That establishes a baseline tonality for the book that Holmes fans might enjoy, but it does not supply the oomph that the real Holmes mysteries provide; and Conan Doyle managed that even though we all knew that Holmes would, in the end, get the bad guy and do it in a characteristic way.<br />There are no mathematical or more traditional mysteries solved here. I guess the \\"bad guy\\" in these stories is supposed to be generic ignorance and some sort of innumerate tendency in the reading population (expressed via the straw-man \\"Watson\\"). Math literate readers will, perhaps, enjoy the poke at the widespread probabilistic ignorance of Watson's \\"everyman\\", but where's the fun (or the discovery) in that?  In the two pieces I read, Bruce repeated the pattern of giving away the point in the first bit and then just pounding it in to poor Watson's head and the helpless reader. This seemed a clumsy attempt to copy the original in which Holmes would drop some sly suggestion of his focal point and elegantly uncover it for Watson and the reader.<br />For more engaging mathematics I'd suggest Ivars Peterson's \\"The Jungles of Randomness\\"... for critiques of mathematical blindspots and cultural ignorance, John Paulos' s work.straw-man \\"Watson\\").

It's not an easy job. It's also hard to be an expert in any one piece of the job. But now, many are hearing that we're losing the &quot;math race&quot; to other countries. The drums of &quot;teacher competency&quot; are booming... and any wise teacher knows where the drum sticks will be landing next!<br />Liping Ma's book comes at an opportune time for those teachers and should be read by all. It dives into a central problem that elementary teachers face when we consider improving our math programs: How could going off and learning more math help, for instance, in a 4th grade fractions unit?  Furthermore, having, typically, been taught mathematics, ourselves, as a process of memorizing and applying procedures, we often teach it that way as well, thinking \\"how much more can I study the `flip and multiply' rule for fraction division?\\"<br />This book answers those and many other questions, while opening many new ones. There's more to math, even \\"kids math\\" than meets the eye. <br />Ma demonstrates that American teachers do not necessarily suffer from a lack of breadth or extensiveness of mathematical training. Adding more `higher math' to our training really would not help us teach arithmetic. We lack deep knowledge of \\"fundamental mathematics.&quot; Ma's claim is that what we need to do is to dig deeper into the underpinnings of \\"elementary\\" math - to discover that there is much more to understand about such fundamental concepts. There really is much more to subtraction than remembering when to &quot;regroup.&quot;  Division of fractions actually represents two or three fundamentally different processes which, confused, can be at the center of students (and teachers) uncertainty.  Imagine that!<br />These are thought provoking ideas, well presented. In the face of a growing national debate about \\"competency\\", we would do well to add this element to the discussion of math teaching. Otherwise, the politicians will provide their inevitably simplistic answers.	2001-07-12

You've probably also come to realize that these vary widely in emphasis (consciousness, healing, the paranormal... now evolution), and you've probably worried that they vary in quality as well - you're right.<br />Johnjoe McFadden's \\"Quantum Evolution\\" is, thus far, the best of the lot that I have discovered. It is engaging, extremely readable, consistently scientific and broadly important in its explorations.<br />If you are mostly interested in the healing or paranormal or so-called \\"new age\\" linkages to quantum phenomena, look elsewhere. The strength of this book is that it maintains a stance on the scientific side of the matter even as the science steps into the looking glass of quantum reality.<br />Many in the sciences don't seem to know what to do with the quantum world. The physicists seem to wobble in their ability to create rich models at any level above that of the quantum phenomena themselves - perhaps because theirs can be a sparse world... the vast emptiness beyond the quark. They are often only comfortable \\"wrapping\\" the ultimately incomprehensible realities of the quantum world in merely mathematical or semantic models.<br />McFadden, on the other hand, comes to this effort as a life scientist. As a molecular biologist he has moved from internationally recognized work on Tuberculosis to explorations at the bacterial level to studies of the molecular activities of the cell. Now, he has moved to the realization that the strange, spooky realm of quantum particle-waves, of wave-function collapse and multiple-world models is a logical next step. Singularly important life processes do not function merely at the molecular level of the chemists. Their core elements are actions and movements of individual particles, of single protons and electrons, and hence only understandable through quantum models - however strange the reality they demand.<br />This book is clearly intended for the thoughtful layperson. It succeeds admirably in its task of educating the reader in a broad base of realms of scientific knowledge. Chapters are divided into smaller 1-3 page \\"chunks\\" that isolate pieces of larger concepts in such a way as to allow you to skip or skim a section if you consider yourself comfortable with the science at hand. This approach will also help you build a really solid working knowledge of, for instance, the molecular biology of life, of cellular respiration, by digesting pieces at a time. If you take your time you can learn a lot and step into the strange quantum science with a much more confident grip on the scientific substrate of the argument.<br />By taking on evolution, which most scientists consider central to understanding life, McFadden manages to build a broader, but always scientific, exploration, that takes quantum realities as its launch point. Early in the book the author demonstrates his wonder at the role of life, itself, in the universe, and states his abiding respect for the role of natural selection and evolution in the development of life. He nevertheless candidly and even-handedly explores some of the more recent scientific critiques of the central Darwinian model - of so-called \\"punctuated evolution\\" for example.<br />Once he has established a strong, scientific tone for the discussion he opens the door to one typically less-scientific alternative to evolution by natural selection. This is the notion of directed adaptation. Species might not only change, over time, through the interaction of random mutation and changing environment - the Darwinian model. Instead, individual organisms might, somehow, adapt and change as individuals and pass on those changes to succeeding generations. This \\"Lamarckian\\" paradigm had been considered discredited by steady accumulation of scientific data. But the kinks inthe data have also accumulated and range from the broadly geological (gaps and leaps in the fossil record) to the minutely molecular (multi-sequence molecular processes of life which cannot be decomposed into selectable smaller sequences).<br />Having educated you in a broad range of life science, guided you through the mirrored funhouse of quantum reality, and finally built scientific bridges to the bio-molecular from the quantum, here is where McFadden has led you: to answer the questions at the core of evolutionary theory, itself at the core of life. How he manages that final piece is fascinating, sometimes unsettling, and yours to discover. There is no way that quantum explanations of anything can be wholly grasped, no way to entirely resist the urge to simply reject them as meaningful underpinnings of reality. Nevertheless, I think McFadden accomplishes this latter synthesis extremely well, suggesting answers to a fascinating range of questions along the way.the data have also accumulated and range from the broadly geological (gaps and leaps in the fossil record) to the minutely molecular (multi-sequence molecular processes of life which cannot be decomposed into selectable smaller sequences).<br />Having educated you in a broad range of life science, guided you through the mirrored funhouse of quantum reality, and finally built scientific bridges to the bio-molecular from the quantum, here is where McFadden has led you: to answer the questions at the core of evolutionary theory, itself at the core of life.

This book might turn out to be the \\"shot heard round the (educational) world.\\" After all, right up there with Harry Potter's \\"he-who-must-not-be-named\\", is that-which-should-not-be-mentioned: HOMEWORK! This is a book for parents, for teachers and for school authorities who think its time we started talking about the darker side of homework.<br />I write this review as a father of four and as a teacher of, roughly, 125 youngsters each year. Under the former hat I've always found that my kids manage their homework load and doubtless \\"do better\\" in school because of the time they put into it. But wearing the latter hat I would have to absolutely agree that the authors, one a teacher of 12 years, have initiated an important and necessary discussion that needs to take place in America's homes, schools and legislatures.<br />Every teacher I know understands that anywhere from one-fifth to one-third of the students we spend our days with do not have both pieces of the homework compound word. The schools provide the \\"work\\", the kids are supposed to provide the \\"home.\\" <br />But, at Kralovec and Buell make clear, so often \\"home\\" is, a sad and challenging combination of \\"dad's place Monday, mom's place Tuesday\\", or \\"mindin' my niece\\",  or (in my rural district) a corner in a 60-by-12 trailer shared with five others and two televisions, or dodging bottles, or just trying to figure out what to do with so many sad or angry people in your life. We KNOW that if we took some metric like annual family income, or square-footage of home, or some measure of \\"intact\\" families and lined them up top-to-bottom next to grades or averages we'd find a pretty close correlation. A large body of research supports this fact.<br />Would I say to my class, \\"Tonight I want you all to log on to the Internet on a high-speed cable link (this site has lots of great Java applets) and complete this online project. Email me your results. This assignment will count as 10% of your grade\\"? Of course not! I know that more than half of them don't have the technology at home. Could I say \\"tonight's assignment is to interview both parents to get their opinions about Vermeer. Only one interview means half credit\\"? Of course not! I know that more than half don't have two parents to interview! Should I, on a daily basis, remind those children of what's missing in their lives?   Teachers in some schools notice that when they count homework as a substantial part of the children's grade, and some do, their \\"bell curve\\" turns into \\"camels humps\\" - almost half D's and F's on the \\"restriction list\\" and almost half A's and B's as \\"students of distinction.\\"  Should we just develop a list of \\"home risk\\" factors and save all the lies, half-truths, recriminations and heartache by giving students with two $6-an-hour working parents C's and those living with alcoholics D's ? That's too often how it works out.<br />And that's just the rough stuff. <br />The book does a fine job of extending the argument. After all, the adults in those non-homes are rarely together enough or self-confident enough to stand up to the educational establishment. Something will only change if the functional \\"homes\\" are being impacted by homework. They are. <br />Kralovec and Buell frankly and compellingly point out the more subtle, negative effects of homework on more intact households: the inevitable disruption and lessening of family time, the shouldering-aside of other activities, other \\"learning\\" available in churches, clubs, neighborhood, even the elimination of play or simple, \\"down\\" time that most quite functional adults need and grab when they \\"veg out\\" with television after an exhausting day.<br />The book is convincing in moving beyond anecdote to highlight the simple, startling duals fact that there is startlingly little educational research on the effects or efficacy of homework and that what research there is provides a very inconclusive base of results. There is no compelling proof that homework increases true student achievement, especially before high school. Imagine that.<br />Moving from the kitchen table and the research, the third chapter in the book uncovers some surprising history for those of us younger than 70 or so. The history of homework is not at all one of wide acceptance. From the turn of the prior century to about the late 1930's there was a vigorous debate in the parenting press and even medical circles proposing the negatives of homework. It helps to realize that one is not really calling for revolution - only return to an older truth.<br />It is at this point that the book steps up and shows that it is about more than just dumping some bales of tea in the harbor. This is not just a PTA-chat book. Kralovec and Buell take some time to discuss and analyze the \\"political economy\\" of schooling. They describe how so much of the homework \\"ethic\\" which, more than fact or history, drives the push for achievement and rigor through homework, derives from broader and deeper cultural and economic themes. The links to these matters and such large issues as global economies and competitiveness is not typical PTA material but, nevertheless, at the core of this discussion.<br />It is here that some teachers and parents might start to detach from the book - especially if they are looking for simpler truths. I'd hope most would not because these elements truly do underlie any discussion of work  or schools or their conjunction.<br />Stick with it, though, because the book concludes with a nicely practical suite of suggestions for changing things; starting where all big changes start - with conversations between friends and colleagues. I believe they are fundamentally correct in suggesting that those of us who start such discussions will discover many, many folks who also think something needs to be done about homework. We just thought we were alone in that belief.  Not so.	2001-07-09

After all, I didn't even become &quot;literary&quot; until I read James Merrill for the first time in 1992, late in his career and well after the world of letters had recognized and honored his life's work. His writing led me to Dante and Milton and eventually to a broad sweep of modern poets. It might lead you there as well.<br />Alison Lurie, on the other hand quickly establishes her credentials in &quot;Familiar Spirits&quot; as both early, close friend of Merrill, and established member of his literary circle going back over forty years. Who am I to question her re-casting of the poet I know only through luminous verse and conversations with the gods, as a mere mortal? She knew the man. It was she, Lurie reminds us, whom he called, even in his sixties, to weep about a quarrel with his lover. She called him Jimmy. <br />James Merrill's poetry seemed so often to be glancingly autobiographical... the people and places (and absences) in his life were a substrate upon which he grew some startling and wonderful poetry. But it was always only refracted autobiography. One wondered at the life itself. Yet, during his lifetime, Merrill rarely obliged with more than the slightest bits of extra-poetic reflection.<br />When Merrill died in 1995 many readers mourned the fact that we would be offered no more glimpses of that life, which had come to illuminate our own in surprising ways. Perhaps, had he lived, his admirers would have eventually, greedily, consumed him. Instead, into the vacuum of that terminated story, came this insider view - a delightful prospect. Reading it, delight turns to dismay as Merrill is, instead, consumed here by a friend.<br />This book is a rambling hodge-podge of disconnected anecdote and amateurish psychology. Lurie trots out sweeping theories of Merrill and Jackson's flaws while repeatedly noting that in 40-plus years of friendship, of observing the damage she documents here, she was silent. I kept wondering, &quot;why didn't you say something to them?&quot; She notices that in the single reference to her in &quot;Sandover&quot; Merrill mentions &quot;Alison's shrewd / silence.&quot; Perhaps she neglects to wonder if Merrill's famously developed pun'ishness wasn't anticipating this shrewish and narrow 'memoir.'<br />Lurie is almost embarrassing in her evident need for us to believe she was a key player in lives and works that she is simultaneously trashing. She hints that her own comment about the lack of prose writers in the pantheon of characters visited in Sandover might account for the &quot;sudden appearance of Jane Austen and Dickens&quot; in the last part of the trilogy. That coy &quot;sudden&quot; is emblematic of Lurie's style here. (Odd, too, that she was such a fine observer of the poem when she acknowledges that she did not ever read the final two-thirds of &quot;Sandover&quot; until setting out on this book). The credits do not roll the other way, though. She is deeply troubled by David Jackson's inability to get his own work published (rightly suggesting that he deserves some form of co-authorship for &quot;Sandover&quot;) and mourns his creative decay. She cites as an example of his &quot;intermittent&quot; creative energy his writing of &quot;proposals for work other people might write.&quot; One of these, &quot;a Key West ghost story that I eventually wrote&quot; - she hastens to assure us, &quot;in a different version.&quot;<br />Doubtless Merrill's relationships were as complex and reactive as life will always provide. It's sad to learn that his lifelong beloved, Jackson, is now an emphysemic and alcoholic ghost. It's instructive to consider how their 20-years-long connections to their muses at the Ouija board might represent a collaboration deserving of more examination. It's troubling to wonder at how Peter Hooten, the last love of Merrill's life, might have manipulated the ego of the poet to gain latecomer entrance to the sanctorum Lurie describes from within. But it's just plain unsettling to be led to wonder at the more complex nature of these deep and abiding relationships in Merrill's life by such a shallow and un-insightful guide.<br />Within &quot;Sandover&quot; itself, Merrill refers to the story as that of &quot;the incarnation and withdrawal of a god.&quot; For those of us whose admiration of the man's work cast a mirrored glow on the man himself, a similar withdrawal toward reality is probably a necessary salting. But for the dose of reality to be delivered in such an arch and artless way would surely have left Merrill himself wincing. Not at Lurie's accusations of his myriad blind spots when it came to love, he centered much of his writing around that mystery, but at the singularly graceless form in which they are delivered, here, decades too late.<br />The appearance of this book becomes something of a commentary on the nature of friendship, on fame, and on the conjunction of the two. Frankly, if Lurie's was as reciprocal a friendship as she would have us believe, that, alone, raises more powerful doubts in one's mind about Merrill's ability to build relationships than any of her psychobabble. But too many, commenting more briefly thus far, have claimed the opposite - have glowed in their descriptions of Merrill as friend - for one not to conclude that Lurie drew some of her conclusions through a darker glass.<br />The book ends with a luridly counterbalancing &quot;afterwards&quot;, waxing eloquent about Merrill's life and work - even to the extent of including Hooten, cast throughout as gold-digger and &quot;B&quot; movie player, in a trio of &quot;beautiful and gifted young men.&quot; It neatly reflects the schizophrenia of this book, or perhaps the post-prandial doubts of its author.<br />If you know little of James Merrill's work, read his poetry first, read &quot;Sandover&quot;, too. If, instead, you know and love his work, you are in for a strange experience if you read this book. Thesecond star in this review exists only because the complexity of Merrill's work and life reflects light into this strange, dark little book in ways its author cannot be credited with.	2001-07-08

In the hands of a superb craftsman such as Merrill, one sees new dynamism in poetic forms.<br />But, I've always wondered at the role of form in teaching poetry. This year I had the unusual opportunity to teach writing to 6th graders. I purchased Myra Cohn Livingston's book as an assist to my planning for an extensive poetry unit. I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it.<br />I have often worried that an emphasis on 'clever' forms such as &quot;name&quot; or &quot;shape&quot; poems distorts younger students' sense of what poetry is or can be. I feel that I spent quite a bit of this past year nudging this or that young poet to move beyond the poem shaped like a football to the one which captured, in its words, their delight with the game. Form became a wall blocking the view of things more important. But I must say that I wouldn't join those who would abandon form. And my students often took such delight in these previously-learned approaches that I could hardly wish to diminish their enthusiasm.<br />Subtitled &quot;Ways to begin writing poetry&quot;, I expected this book would provide exercises and the like which ignite or launch a writing process. In a sense it does this. But the ignition is apparently intended to be that of a given form. Having looked at, e.g., elements of &quot;sound&quot; in poetry, a student might launch by trying to create a poem emphasizing alliteration. Limericks, haiku, cinquains and the other specific forms receive similar treatment.<br />In another way I was somewhat confused about the book's stance - in this case regarding its own audience. If it wasn't to be a collection of entry points for teachers, I thought that it would be a book written for my students to read or browse. Instead, it is a collection of essays about voice andform which a teacher or an older student poet will benefit from reading. Its  certainly not aimed at the reading level of my younger poets and poetesses.<br />Livingston's writing is crisp and engaging and the book is a pleasure to read. I would be comfortable handing it to a 14-year-old poet as a self-teaching tool but ended up satisfied with its role in my teaching and thinking about poetry. As one who does not take too fondly to taxonomies of poetic form, technical treatises and the like, I found it to be exactly at my level in many ways.... just not what I expected.	2001-07-07

A lot of folks thought this was just because students with limited ability appropriately worried about the subject. Not so!<br />Just the other day I clipped a short piece that described a scientific study demonstrating that this &quot;math anxiety&quot; itself gets in the way of doing the math. The chicken that comes before this egg is not low ability but high anxiety. Finding ways to lessen that math anxiety can improve math achievement.<br />As a parent and as a math teacher this is important news. Many parents have worried about how they could help their children with math that is often very different from when they were kids. These studies tell us that we'd do better to try to find ways to turn a math &quot;phobic&quot; home into a &quot;Math Power&quot; place. Patricia Kenschaft's book is a wonderful blueprint for such a home 'remodeling' project.<br />The significant subtitle of this book is:<br />&quot;How to Help Your Child Love Math, Even If You Don't.&quot;<br />There, as Shakespeare said, lies the rub. After all, most parents bring those same childhood math anxieties right up into their adult lives, right to the dinner (or homework) table. What Kenschaft does is to show you a wide variety of ways, starting even in pre-school, that you and your child can explore math in wholly new forms. You don't have to memorize the rules for fraction division all over again; you just need to find new ways of looking at math.<br />This book does the best job I have seen of describing the failings of the &quot;old school&quot; approach to math. It has an entire section entitled &quot;Why so many children are damaged&quot; including chapters entitled &quot;How drill and kill cripples U.S. Math education&quot; and &quot;What every parent should know about testing and grading.&quot; (My only critique of the book is that this section is placed near the end of the book - you might read itfirst if you think that going back to the good ole days is the sort of change we need).<br />The book emphasizes the math of children up to about age 10 or 11, wrapping up with a chapter called &quot;The Fifth Grade Crisis.&quot; I had never seen this term used before. But as a 6th grade teacher I believe she has captured an important soft spot in our math education system. Although the ups and downs of kids' math in school all sum up over many years, some important cognitive shifts take place as they open the door into adolescence. Fifth and sixth grades are often the place where they &quot;decide&quot; they are &quot;no good&quot; at math... decide they &quot;can't do it&quot;. Kenschaft shows how much of that decision is just a reaction to some truly damaging practices in schools.<br />Kenschaft also encourages you to take a new view of your role in the school - beyond bakesales! She provides practical advice for you to become a school-math activist without being antagonistic. A chapter entitled \\"Getting along with your child's teachers\\" is full of good, practical advice. She concludes with a whole section about change entitled \\"Tweaking the Machine\\". Finally there are useful appendices and a great bibliography.<br />This book is especially powerful because it weaves the very personal with the broadly `political'. Its combination of practical advice with broad policy discussions is unique. If you are a parent wondering how to approach the troubling questions surrounding your child's school math program, at both levels, this book will give you lots to think about.	2001-07-07

I used it as a first-year teacher of writing, but ended up buying a second copy after sharing-out my original with a colleague with substantially more experience.<br />For starters, the book is well-written and concise. For busy teachers (is that a tautology?) this means you will really read and really use it. It has all the elements that keep such readers engaged: practical classroom ideas, samples of student work, segmentation of topics into smaller components and, wide-ranging perspective.<br />Most importantly, however, the book has PASSION! Heard launches you with an introduction entitled &quot;Poetry, Like Bread, Is for Everyone&quot;. She maintains this level of enthusiasm through to the last page, where she quotes Matthew Fox to the effect that &quot;The Celtic peoples... insisted that only poets could be teachers... knowledge that is not passed through the heart is dangerous.&quot;<br />I agree - passion HAS TO BE the core of a poetry program in elementary or middle school. Amidst the wash of demand for reading and writing more expository material that standardized testing has brought to the writing class, passion and poetry have often slipped to the background. The poetry 'program' can become a quick trot through narrow 'tricksie' forms like name-poems and shape-poems. Kids need more. You do too.<br />Heard offers a wonderful suite of approaches to poetry 'centers' in a chapter on &quot;Making a Poetry Environment.&quot; These include listening, illustration, performance and music centers as well as poetry windows, amazing language center and a handful more. The centers-based approach can be hard to manage unless properly prepared, but it is a wonderful way to build fluidity into a process that otherwise suffers from rigidity of task or schedule. This book will offer strong support for such an approach. <br />In the chapter discussing &quot;Writing Poetry&quot;, Heard takes the metaphor of the door as entryway, suggesting, among others, the &quot;observation door&quot;, the &quot;concern about the world door&quot; and the &quot;wonder door.&quot; She then moves to the details of crafting of poetry with a &quot;toolbox&quot; metaphor and a nice collection of tools. In this as in the earlier instances, her pedagogical metaphors will serve your students but also serve to structure your planning and presentation of concepts. Heard concludes with a chapter about the observational element of the poet's craft - what she terms &quot;sharpening outer and inner visions&quot;, and a number of useful appendices.<br />I'm certain this book will light-up your enthusiasm for a poetry-based classroom.	2001-07-07

What a great idea !<br />As a writing teacher I was delighted to find this book for my classroom. But as a father of two boys, I'm happy to recommend it to any parent who is looking for ways to engage their sons in poetry and reflection. Taking as its backbone a fictional journal created by ten-year-old Ned, this slender but wonderful book does a nice job of both.<br />Ned has decided to yield to his fourth grade teacher's interest in poetry by keeping a daily journal of his life, which he will write in verse. Although his motives for this aren't clear, he proceeds with creativity and enthusiasm and provides us with a year-long window into his life.<br />Of course, it's the real poets, authors Fan and Elizabeth Brown, who supply the true creativity here. Illustrator Greg Betza adds a supportive, but unobtrusive touch. Together, I think they create just the right degree of intimacy and reflection. <br />Like most fourth graders, Ned is not (yet) a deep thinker, but he is learning to develop an observational and questioning mindset. That his observations sometimes focus on things like the single black hair in his grandfather's nose seems to me to be dead-on for a ten-year-old. His range of observations spans over family and friends, trials and triumphs at school and all the generally small pieces that build a life. Relationships are at the core of his story.<br />The telling takes a variety of verse forms and sometimes delves into Ned's struggles with the form itself - as when he wrestles to create a haiku.  I was a little disappointed that the emphasis on rhyme in Ned's writing during his fictional year did not diminish and show some growth in poetic maturity - but I'm usually similarly disappointed by this over-attraction to rhyme in my young writers' verse as well. Sigh...<br />This is not really a book for older pre-adolescents. They will probably be over-sensitive to the pegging of the setting at fourth grade. Furthermore, by the age of twelve or so, they will usually have expanded their depth of inner and outer exploration to more abstract views and more challenging topics. For this you might look into the poetry books of Sara Holbrook. It is also not a book for a quick glance, or for browsing through. It proceeds at a steady pace through a full year with over 120 separate entries. Youngsters who pick it up will need an extended time to be with the book. In a classroom it should be an overnight loaner. As an attractive but solid, square hardback it will stand up to time's thumbings.<br />Notwithstanding its focused audience, this is great stuff! It is not just a book for boys (my eight-year-old daughter says it is \\"great\\") but it's an especially fine book especially for boys. Think about how rarely a book for boys in that age bracket reminds them (and us) that they have an active reflective and inner life. It's a wonderful approach, well executed here. Hopefully the authors will revisit Ned when he is 13 or 16!	2001-07-06
US	52912007	R1TMCFG2NHDQZ9	1563977370	288571731	Walking on the Boundaries of Change: Poems of Transition	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	For a classroom library or the young adult in your life.	I added this and a few others of Sara Holbrook's works to a 6th grade classroom poetry library. The youngsters gobbled up her works. I was delighted.<br />But teachers aren't the only ones looking to help young people connect feelings and writing. I'm also a parent of children in the 8-15 range and I'm alert to ways to provide other channels for my kids' explorations of inner and outer life. These books are great for that as well.<br />The 50-odd poems in this slim collection are roughly centered around the wide range of life changes that young people today face, often alone. But there's nothing like a voice describing what you feel to help you think about it while feeling it. These poems all work at that level.<br />Here are the start end the ending of her poem &quot;Run Away&quot;:<br />I saw JoLynn just once\ after she ran away.\ We hugged at each other's eyes,\ touched hands\ with little to say.\<br />...\\<br />When she was running into all those problems\ she used to snap and spit like fire.\ But, now that she's run away,\ the heat is off -\ she just looks tired.\<br />Nice stuff. Not great poetry, perhaps, but good poetry and thought-provoking. What better doorway to great poetry in later years ?<br />As a writing teacher, I enjoyed the opportunity to move these younger pre-teens to look at poetry beyond the Shel Silverstein style. Many kids that age have decided that poetry is only fun, silly, &quot;rhymin' Simon' stuff, as I called it. I think the best way to connect them to un-rhymed verse is through powerful themes. Holbrook accomplishes this. She sometimes sneaks in subtle rhyme, and even includes a sonnet or two, but mostly her emphasis is on feelings and words to express them... a place you might hope your writer(s) will explore.<br />Some of the themes are probably more appropriate for 8th-10th graders rather than 5th-7th, and some of them revolve around urban lifestyles that my primarily rural students did not connect with. Like any good collection there will be something for everyone here; and even if issues of sexuality and gangs are not a part of the kids lives, I'd rather have them explore these issues in poetry than on MTV!	2001-07-05

I wrote a longer review of Sara Holbrook's collection &quot;Walking on the Boundaries of Change&quot; which you might take a glance at. Much applies to this collection as well.<br />Holbrook writes poetry for young people in the 10-15 age range. As a teacher of 6th graders, I think they are a 'demographic group' that sometimes must feel invisilble. Not for lack of being marketed-at and sold-to, though. Invisible because they are always being asked to don the personae of either &quot;child&quot; or &quot;teenager&quot;. Usually they are neither, and often they seem to find the cultural fit and expectations of these to be ill-matched to their inner lives. It is rare to find anything, books included, that fit comfortably. Holbrook's work fits.<br />One thing kids this age are, is poetic. Bad poets - often. Illiterate poets, sometimes. Poets disguised as musicians - frequently. But, because they are thinking, changing, thinking again and jumping, always, to a new vantage point - they are poets. Holbrook, who apparently started writing poems when her own children started growing up, connects to the poet in young people by connecting to the range and jump of their lives.<br />Unlike the other collection I reviewed, &quot;Am I Naturally This Crazy&quot; seems to be more directed toward younger young folks... somewhat more connected to the needs of 10-12 year-olds than those of 12-15's. This is perhaps a too-subtle distinction, since they are all boundary-crossers, but definitely my sense of the overall collection. It is not lightweight - she speaks to issues like divorce - but somewhat less complex, less abstract. Of course, since your typical 10-12 year-old will turn up as a 12-15 year-old, it couldn't hurt to own both!<br />If you are a teacher of young people this age, scatter your room with poetry such as this for the odd, quieter moment. If you are their parent, consider the same.	2001-07-05

After reading this script I'm kicking myself for not yielding to the urge to see this show on a recent visit to NYC. What a fascinating and engaging story!<br />I'm rarely one for reading plays in published form - it's an odd and fundamentally second-tier genre, no?  Sort of like reading sheet music!   But this book was nevertheless entertaining, moving and, at times, startling. <br />Although the story is ultimately a universal one, you might especially enjoy it if you are a fan of recreational mathematics or of stories about mathematicians - I am. Some of the recent splurge of fictionalized accounts include \\"Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture\\", \\"The Wild Numbers\\", and \\"The French Mathematician\\". They are great adjuncts to this story, sharing intimate looks at love, work, and insanity in the lives of those odd creatures - mathematicians. Of course the TRUE story of such a person and such an endeavor is that of Andrew Wiles' 1995 proof of the 350-years-old Fermat's theorem, described eloquently in Simon Singh's book, \\"Fermat's Enigma.\\"<br />Notwithstanding that long reading list, &quot;The Proof&quot; stands alone as a powerful work and as, perhaps, the most human of them all. The mathematics of the play serves as an abstract but intriguing backdrop for the story itself, which is one of family, madness and self-discovery. The sparseness of the casting, with only four characters, adds to the elegance of the tale and doubtless allows a theatrical production to build elements of character and setting that are only imagined by the reader.<br />But go ahead and imagine. At 83 pages it will be, like any script, a quick read. Take the time to savor it.	2001-07-05

For me, this is it. It is not a book for everyone, though. I'll try to offer guidelines to help you decide if it is for you. In summary: (a) its not just a picture book, but extremely visual, (b) its not math-intense but asks for math-comfort and offers options and (c) its not only for computer jockeys, but offers repeated links to that approach.<br><br>This book is doubtless great for a high-school or college course in fractals. But I think it is also a worthy buy, albeit a pricey one, for a certain type of layperson with a fascination for mathematics presented in some depth. If you enjoy math but find some of the \\"popularizations\\" a bit too shallow, then the realm of fractals and chaos is a great place to explore in depth. This is a fine guidebook for that exploration.<br><br>\\"Chaos and Fractals\\" is not a book for the reader who is primarily fascinated with the visual representations of fractals. BUT it i!s chock-full of b/w illustrations (686 by the authors count) and nicely sprinkled with gorgeous color plates. The visual element is not central, but is very strongly represented and I found that almost every important concept was enhanced by the addition of a diagram or illustration.<br><br>This is definitely a book that delves into the mathematics of fractals. It does so in a well-crafted dual-track form. The core of the book should be comfortable and enjoyable mathematical reading for anyone with a sound and fairly current familiarity with high school math (Not that such \\"currency\\" suggests its only for youngsters! This old-timer preserves essentially that level of math by regular exposure to recreational math and the like). On the second track, the book provides mathematically in-depth views of selected topics. This is really nice if you like to stretch your mathematical horizons since you can use the core to steady your foundation understanding of a topic and then dive int!o the advanced mathematical topics at will; mustering strategic retreat when necessary, without loss of face, but sometimes learning how more advanced mathematics can be used.<br><br>Finally, the book makes an effort to scaffold some computer exploration of fractal concepts that succeeded for me but might not for you. For every chapter the authors provide a \\"Program of the Chapter\\" which allows exploration of one or more of the fractal forms and concepts explored therein. These are usually quite short and are written in Microsoft BASIC. This latter might be a problem for some. Nowadays, users with more advanced operating systems might not know where to find their version of BASIC (and it might not even be supplied), much less how to fire it up. <br><br>I would not belabor the BASIC program element too much except that experimenting with such code is an excellent way for anyone to better understand an algorithmic process. A program is, after all, such a process - a sequence of !discrete steps. I'd urge you to search your Windows disk for something like an \\"oldmsdos\\" folder and dig out the Qbasic files found there and fire them up. Even if you've never written a program, this kind of applied-use is a fine way to learn!<br><br>For the right sort of reader, this is unquestionably a 5-star book.	2001-07-04

As one who consumes information voraciously, primarily in the form of books, and is fascinated by the role of language in human thought, I have always been surprised by how boring I find so-called \\"information theory.\\" I keep trying. There ought to be something there? So, combining with a more recent interest in \\"consciousness studies\\", I expected great things from this book.<br />I was quite disappointed. You might not be. Since I see lots of other positive reviews here that also outline the book's content, I'll focus more on style issues, since it was those which mostly left me out of gas after 100 or so pages. Perhaps you can determine if these same concerns would affect your appreciation of the book.<br />The writing in this book never captivated me, frankly never even engaged me; and the ideas, however powerful, stayed submerged. Its not that I need a Hemingway to craft an essay on consciousness in order to be gripped by it; witness my high rating of Evan Walker's \\"Physics of Consciousness\\", with its bumpy, sometimes windy style and odd rhetorical devices. And, having worked my way through Dennett's \\"Consciousness Explained\\", I know its not that I shy away from complex ideas. <br />I just need, like a radio station, a strong carrier frequency to modulate the message. Dennett accomplishes this with a quite engaging style that Nrretranders lacks - possibly a dilution effect of translation. Walker manages the same, frankly, by having eminently (and evidently) skippable passages. While reading this book, my own skip/scan reading engine kept reacting to the mushy, swampy places by making the jump, but rarely found a solid place to land.  <br />Like many books that seek to bring the \\"lay\\" reader into a realm defined by the outposts of modern science, this book lays down a substantial prologue seeking to introduce many complex concepts. I usually try to read most of this section on the theory that I might not know quite as much as I think. But I usually can realize when I am plowing a field in which my level of knowledge is up to the level of the presentation. At that point I look to skip ahead and seek rhetorical or syntactic guideposts to indicate the next island for my leap. In \\"User Illusion\\" there was something blurry about the whole first part; never a sense of discrete elements and hence no way to untangle the well-known from the new. <br />Finally, in frustration, I went to an extensive scan-ahead; flipping and scanning the middle third of the book to try to find where it was headed, to find the big ideas. (I rarely \\"read\\" this way. It's a measure of my high expectations for the content that I resorted to such perfidy.) All I could find was an apparent circling-around of the \\"half-second delay\\" discovery of Libet mentioned in other reviews. Since I had already encountered that in Dennett (not as a central point but as a marker on the road to a more powerful argument), I called it quits.<br />Fans of the book might, correctly, argue that I missed its point. How can I argue since I never discovered that it? But it wasn't for lack of trying. If you know you're a reader who can abide exciting ideas portrayed without excitement you might be rewarded by reading this book. I remain suspicious that the central (and perhaps powerful) idea of this book could be stated in several pages than in the form provided. You might learn more from reading the reviews right here on Amazon; then plow into a few listmania! lists on cognitive science, or (is there one?) information theory!	2001-07-03

But Simon Singh faced a parallel challenge in writing this book, and must be appreciated for his achievement.<br />Popularizers of mathematics face the inherent twofold challenge of (a) taking some portion of a subject that the huge majority of readers are frankly afraid of and making it interesting and (b) representing the vast power underlying mathematical ideas while remaining intelligible. In the former case they often frankly succeed by the self-selection of their readers. This now-narrowed readership is then typically more approachable with the mathematical challenges of the latter. Hence the success of Stewart, Paulos, Devlin and the like.<br />Singh's challenge was increased because of the addition of that third element. The range of mathematics which Wiles' proof and the history of the problem traversed is, simply put, incredible. On top of that, the mathematics behind Wiles' proof was acknowledged in the mathematical community to be at a level that even 95% of mathematicians could not comprehend. How to distill that in a meaningful way?<br />The one thing Singh had going for him was the pure magic of the story. A mathematical problem simple enough to be understood by a 10-year-old is launched, in fact, on the epic story of its pursuit by a real 10-year-old over 30-odd years! He uses this and his considerable skills as a writer to tell a story that is gripping throughout.<br />But Singh does not shy away on the mathematics. He does. For instance, a fine job of presenting the notion of rigorous mathematical proof. Having poked around this topic for a few years, I would also have to say that his is the best &quot;lay&quot; presentation of some of the most challenging elements of the mathematics of the proof, so called &quot;modular forms&quot; and &quot;elliptic curves&quot;, that I have read.<br />Along the way, this book does a wonderful job of representing the sometimes turbulent, but fascinating lives of working mathematicians - especially those at the peak of their craft. I suspect that this book, together with NOVA's &quot;The Proof&quot; (and perhaps with some credit to Wiles!) has led to the recent swell in fictionalized accounts of such lives (and such proofs). I, for one, was led to read the delightful &quot;Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture&quot; and &quot;The Wild Numbers&quot; (casting light on the grayer lives of less-talented mathematicians) and noticed the arrival of the new, hit Broadway play, &quot;The Proof&quot;.

It's hard to imagine how a twenty-fifth 5-star review can do any more to convince anyone to read this book... But I will try!<br />I HATED history in school, and rarely read history as an adult. Nevertheless, I was engrossed by this book and could hardly put it down, notwithstanding 900+ pages! It has revived my interest in (accurate) history, and might do the same for you.<br />If you like your history shined-up with the polyurethane glow of hero-sweat, don't go near this book; unless, that is, you would like to actually learn something and enjoy the learning along the way.  In the end you might discover a hero or two, but mostly you will come away quite convinced that the \\"popular\\" history of our own nation is seemingly as intent as that of the old USSR on covering-up and inverting the facts. Imagine that!<br />Say \\"Alien and Sedition Act\\" to most people who have not completely blocked their recall of high school US history and you will see the whites of their eyes - rolling up into a coma!  This could be the single most boring and meaningless datum we were required to remember, no?<br />But now, on reading \\"American Aurora\\", I find that the \\"act\\" was slammed through Congress as a way of shipping as many as possible of the troublesome new Irish immigrants off-shore as possible - before the election of 1800 where they were expected to cause electoral trouble for the Federalists. Imagine that !<br />For that matter, say \\"Federalist\\" to most folks and you can clear the room... a few desperate souls mumbling about \\"Marbury and Madison\\".  But, WHEN you read this book (it cannot be an \\"if\\"), you'll realize how fundamental the rift was and how vicious the political battle was that constructed the foundations of our political structure.. So many of our history teachers wished that we would understand the \\"fundamental\\" part - but that we would somehow accept that anything so important was settled by a bunch of powdered wigs (or was it whigs?) in grand public session - thatit was all neatly sewn up, somehow, after Cornwallis's band played \\"The World Turned Upside Down.\\"  The true story reads more like Capone's Chicago and the \\"settling\\" of the issue was a messy, decade-long business.<br />In style the book frightened me. Really! It is peppered with original documents of the era - letters and the like. That sort of \\"authenticity\\" often seems to just introduce confufing fyntax and fpelling that drives me away. Well, consider a quote from a letter from Thomas Paine to Washington. &quot;You slept away your time in the field till the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have little share in the glory of the final event. It is time, sir, to speak the undisguised language of historical truth.&quot;. Sheesh!  We realize that even Paine, usually cast as a firebrand only in the `liberty or death' category, was outspoken in other ways, which have not echoed down the halls of official history. Imagine that!<br />Ultimately the mixture of original source documents and well-crafted storytelling is a knock-your-socks-off combination. This is absolutely compelling history and a great read to boot.	2001-07-02

I can't say that it turned out to be a particularly useful tool - for me.<br />New teachers might consider purchasing this book if they are both (a) somewhat nervous about the \\"technical\\" level of their own skills and (b) intent upon giving those technical elements a significant role in their writing classes.  For both of these, its variety of exemplary lists of grammatical forms and genres and the like may be useful to both teacher and, in photocopy, to students.<br />If, like me, you intend to focus more on writing, writing, and more writing, and to surround that extensive writing with process/context emphasis such as comes from peer-peer editing or writing response groups, the book will be less useful. I found that once students had created an extensive variety of written work and branched into a wide range of genres, each required a very personal approach from me when we worked together. The occasional listing of, e.g., sight-sound words was handy; but, frankly, the student's individual work usually suggested alternatives and choices to both of us in conference.<br />If you are a new writing teacher, don't just buy this book, as I realize I did, out of insecurity before your first teaching day!  After all, it can be brought to your doorstep in a jiffy once you decide, in the midst of teaching, that you would really use it.	2001-07-02

What if you were teaching children how to play basketball. &quot;Imagine that for the first year, you teach them to dribble and they practice only that. The next year, you move on to passing and catching the ball. The next year is devoted exclusively to learning how to shoot baskets. Then you concentrate on the rules of the game, assigning lots of worksheet exercises, which the children complete while seated at desks, working along, and not talking to each other.\\"<br />That would surely be a \\"hard\\" class, with lots of dropouts. But  even with its rigor, I nevertheless, still wouldn't expect it to produce a Shaq or an Iverson. For that matter I'm not sure it would actually produce basketball players at all. Neither does Marilyn Burns, in this wonderful book, as she cites this example of a \\"ridiculous\\" way to learn basketball and matches it to the way that so many of us were taught mathematics. We can chuckle at the example - but for many it is a nervous chuckle, indeed.<br />Most of us grew up to be neither basketball stars nor mathematicians -  nor even adequate users of mathematics in our lives - and to be desperately resistant to revisiting any part of our mathematical upbringing.. As a 6th grade math teacher, I know this too well. At a party I can find as little company as the proctologists once conversation has turned to professions. On \\"Parents' Night\\"  the easiest way to clear the room is to hint that we might all \\"try some examples\\" of what the students will be doing in the year.  <br />This \\"phobia\\" seems also to be the basis for the immense friction that efforts to reform mathematics have faced in the past decade. Approaches that favor students actively engaging in math, talking to each other, (talking to parents!), responding to open-ended problems and creating algorithms are just so alien that they have faced fierce resistance. Many Americans are as eager to \\"just get through\\" their children's school mathematics experience as they were to survive their own. Any attempt to elaborate or reposition the subject (especially to engage them in new approaches) is, for them, just delaying early parole from their child's sentence to \\"serve\\" 8-12 years. Like any neurosis, this phobia has enervated some and produced mathematical cripples; but it has also energized others whose sense of overcoming math as an obstacle informs their own sense of the nature of \\"success.\\"  <br />Burns knows this from more than a decade of working, through her \\"Math Solutions\\" project, training tens-of-thousands of pre-service and active teachers in new approaches to their classrooms. She is well known in math education circles for her \\"Math By All Means\\" series: which included books with refreshingly new models for teaching `core' topics such as division in grades 3 and 4 as well as unheard of topics such as probability in elementary classrooms. She has since branched into a growing collection of books aimed to directly engage and intrigue kids, as well as more books aimed at bolstering the uncertainty of many teachers who face new challenges but sense the roots of the math phobia in their own lives.<br />I believe this book is her book for parents. Burns commences with a warm chapter discussing the central national mathematics ritual of the year - the production of the perfect Thanksgiving Turkey. Who knew it to include so much math? Or, as Burns dryly wonders, to have driven the market to produce the \\"pop-up\\" turkey to let the math phobics off the hook!  From there she moves to discuss everything from the role of calculators and testing to specific `topics' (teaching fractions and percents), to a general retrospective on \\"Math then and now\\" and a prospective look at solving the phobia problem.<br />Burns seems well aware of the difficult fact that the math phobia will, itself, deter many adults from even a glance at this book. It is surely by design that it is a slender and un-intimidating volume, sprinkled with clear illustrations and quite a fewexamples of student's work. Along the way, it scatters seven less-than-traditional math problems through the chapters and ends with a chapter entitled \\"Not your everyday answer key.\\"<br />Its odd that in a culture swamped with self-help books, where folks will line up, unflinchingly, to purchase books about surviving depression or abusive relationships. I find it hard to imagine many math \\"phobics\\" marching to the cash register with this book in hand (perhaps, thus, more saleable through an online venue). Burns is not one to proffer deep analysis for such troubled folks. Instead she offers a chuckle and a hand for a short walk through a place where math is engaging enough to almost be... fun; a place where our children are exploring every day; a place where the challenges of the 21st century won't be faced with the intellectual tools of the 19th.<br />Buy this book for yourself. Buy a pass-around copy for friends who can't seem to get past grousing about the \\"new, new\\" math. Buy one for the members of your school board and the principal in your child's elementary school. Buy a sympathy copy to anyone you see worrying the pages of one of E.D. Hirsch's \\"What your nth=Grader Needs to Know\\" tomes. What they, and we, really need to know is how to think. This book is a good starting point.	2001-07-01

And anyone involved with or concerned about educational reform should read it, alert to the dictum that &quot;those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;<br />Taylor documents in excruciating detail the grim story of how a dedicated group of ideologues &quot;reformed&quot; reading teaching in California and spread their insupportable beliefs throughout the country and (now) even into mathematics teaching. That they did so by lying may be no surprise - this is always the path of ideologues. But that they lied so baldly, that so many politicians rolled over so supinely, that so many anxious parents jumped to the raised fist of these demagogues is an eye opening story.<br />When Taylor and the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) published this book in 1998 it was seen by many as a finger-in-the-dike against an incredible wash of success of the pro-phonics movement in turning reading education in this country on its head. Many had watched in surprise as a small handful of mere drafts of narrowly conceived research studies were fronted as proof that wholly new approaches to reading education were demanded. But the surprise turned to horror as, sometimes in mere months, this sheaf of papers pulled from a pumpkin was turning California and other legislatures toward a frenzy of legislation implanting phonics-as-policy.  Turning them, even to the extent of legislatures defining what would heretofore be allowed to be called \\"research\\" in support of a reading program. Twisting, even, when the circulated draft studies were shown to be built on narrow assumptions and flawed statistics. Spinning, still, when the final, published copies were similarly flawed but suspiciously lacking some of the lies that, in draft form, had convinced legislators to leap into the parade.<br />While the other reading teachers association, the International Reading Association (IRA) was nervously twiddling its thumbs in committees discussing the need for balance and accommodation of all views, the NCTE, at least saw the paint splashed on the wall and commissioned this work. Within months of California and other states enacting sweeping legislation this book exposed the incredible suite of lies and manipulations underlying the successful campaign leading to that legislation.<br />But it is a campaign that is to this day continuing. Mouth the words \\"Whole Language\\" in public in 2001 and you will notice the knee-jerk responses quickly engulf you in a fog of disdain. Yet the `Whole Language' approach to reading instruction - an approach that included but did not offer primacy to phonics - was at the heart of a research-based model for reading instruction that was embraced by large numbers of teachers, parents and administrators as recently as five years ago. Now they mostly shake their heads and talk about \\"what works\\", pointing to California (or Texas where the flawed studies took place).<br />Only three years later, we now see the juggernaut of lies, emboldened, turned with the same religious zeal, against the past decades of reforms in math teaching. The now successfully tarnished \\"whole language\\" terminology is turned to denigrate these reforms as \\"whole math.\\" Even some of the same reading \\"experts\\" turn up as newly-minted, and outspoken, authorities in mathematics!<br />This can be a tough book to stay with. It was written in the midst of a tornado that has now settled into a national storm. Some parts are polemic, some personal. But it is still critical \\"primary documentation\\" of a public policy hijacking that continues to diminish the educational opportunity of huge and growing numbers of children. If you care about and endorse progressive changes in education you should read this book and speak out. Certainly we don't want, sometime in the future, to be mouthing the phrase \\"first they came for the reading programs, and I was silent, then they came for...\\" A strong analogy, perhaps, but a generation rendered ignorant and lethargic by rote drill and meaningless schooling will certainly be one that is ripe for the plucking of the basest of ideologues.	2001-07-01

If, like me, you were fascinated to hear that Fermat's so-called &quot;last theorem&quot; had been proven in 1995, then read Simon Singh or Amir Aczel's books popularizing the proof in outline, you probably wanted something more.<br />If, like me, you are a person who took some math in college, enjoys recreational mathematics books of the Douglas Hofstadter and Ian Stewart genre, and even sometimes picks up the odd number-theory book, you might consider yourself an \\"amateur.\\"<br />If...if... this might seem like the book for you. I'd suggest that its not.<br />The mathematics in this book and its level of presentation was simply impenetrable by me. Not slow going... \\"no\\" going. That's frustrating to admit, but in a way fine, since it affirms of my admiration at a distance of the work that professional mathematicians do. I have seen many cited who state that Wiles' proof is simply beyond the ken of even 95% of working mathematicians. I believe this book must really be intended to serve some fraction of that group.  Perhaps within the fold of mathematics these would consider themselves \\"amateurs\\". My two stars are offered only for them.<br />The book is simply not for the &quot;lay&quot; amateur. And Ribenboim's titling of it suggests that he does not even know that this lower caste, containing those of us who enjoy recreational mathematics and would describe ourselves as \\"amateurs\\", even exists. We know we exist as something mathematically distinct from the general population by the simple fact of the universally raised eyebrows that confront any mention of our interest in mathematics. Nevertheless, like any other species in a niche, we will have to continue to feed on a sparse supply of intellectual sustenance and learn to avoid the over-rich and indigestible fare of the higher forms.<br />Finally, if you haven't read Singh or Aczel I'd offer the former 5 stars and the latter 3 but recommend both. A truly fascinating story.	2001-07-01
US	52912007	R14V40NQ117J6P	0060975504	351682093	When Nietzsche Wept: A Novel of Obsession	Books	5	11	11	N	Y	A Therapeutic Read	If you are, like me, a fan of Irving Yalom's non-fiction, you might wonder at what you will encounter in his fiction. Wonder no more. This book is fantastic!  <br />A highlight of his non-fictional accounts of psycho-therapeutic encounters with patients has always been the deep humanity of his characterization of people - even desperately unhappy people. He accomplishes the same in this book, while taking-on the daunting task of centering his fictionalized account around some of the most famous names in the history of philosophy and psychology.<br />If you have not read Yalom, I would encourage you to buy this book - but do so along with a purchase of one of his non-fiction works: \\"Momma and the Meaning of Life : Tales of Psychotherapy\\" or \\"Love's Executioner : And Other Tales of Psychotherapy\\", and go ahead and read the latter first. You might well have little anticipation of enjoying accounts of psychotherapy, but I think you will discover that Yalom, at least, does a captivating job of describing the human condition through his eyes and those of his patients. Along the way you will slowly unravel the nature and power of Yalom's \\"existential\\" approach to therapy.   Once you have encountered this approach to life and life-change through  the mixture of the personal and the theoretic in Yalom's non-fiction, you will doubly enjoy the undercurrents of  \\"When Nietzche Wept\\".  Most novels seek to imbed one of more philosophies of life within their character's being or actions. But so many of these turn into such a hodge-podge of pop-culture and authorial idiosyncrasy that characters can lack the coherence that binds us to them as readers. Under the hands of an accomplished novelist this coherence is the challenge met - and the connection to the reader is the connection to the seeming hodge-podge of our own lives - but such success is sadly uncommon.<br />Yalom takes a different tack and succeeds wonderfully, building his characters upon a deeply developed professional awareness of what drives and defines us. Having established over decades of thought and therapy and writing the central elements at the core of being - which he collectively captures as \\"existential\\" - he builds his characters on that base.  It is an amazing thing to see how compellingly these characters present themselves and, in my opinion, further proof of the fundamental power and veracity of the existentialist perspective.<br />Yalom is no dry Camus, though, worrying his suicide beads. He and his characters show a powerful connection to life which is manifest in their powerful connection to the world of ideas. As larger-than-life historic figures, his main characters, Nietzche and Josef Breuer (with Sigmund Freud as a minor character!) do not emerge with the gloss of historical polish. But neither do they emerge as simple folks. The mutual swell of their explorations of the nature of man meets with an explosive energy that Yalom expertly guides through a full and developed and engaging story.	2001-06-30
US	52912007	R2NZY4CL9LH0WM	0395940397	507300156	The Schools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond Traditional Classrooms and "Tougher Standards"	Books	5	7	11	N	Y	Buy a copy for every member of your school board !!	Let's face it... in the past our schools have only rarely been especially powerful centers of learning or emotional growth. But over the past 25 years this narrow educational mediocrity was given a hard look from many quarters. A wide range of ideas for different approaches to schools, kids, and learning started to move into the popular culture and even into the educational establishment. Lots of them were flops - but not all. <br />Nevertheless, as with so many of the suite of powerful ideas for change that have arisen in the last generation, the corporate culture and resurgent cultural contras of the past decade have started to overwhelm fact and reality with a mass re-writing of educational history and practice and values which has swiftly hijacked education from the energized, but messy, path toward reform back onto the clean wide superhighway servicing corporate needs.<br />It is at this intersection - that of the caring, thoughtful professionals, the naturally enthusiastic youngsters and the hopeful parents seeking something better X'ed by the needs of the global marketeers - where so many of the perceived failings of education appear.<br />Here lie the burned-out teachers who fell because they thought to reach high; and also the bland functionaries who offer little more than the next chapter in the teacher's manual. Here are the over-quiet or angry kids whose world is school and hence a universal betrayal; and also the mall-hopping young illiterates who have quickly learned their place as consumers. Here, too, are the parents opting-out for home-schooling, or joining PTAs, or fighting for charter schools or vouchers or basics or something, anything, that will change things; but also the parents who accept bad schools run by distant elites as just the way things have always been. Here the messy mixed-bag of a generation's efforts at reform meets a glossy new suite of old-fashioned lies.<br />Here is where Kohn's book takes its starting point. In a blasting andrelentless 100 page assault, he takes on the myriad of ways that the contra-reform movement in education has gotten it wrong: gotten motivation wrong, gotten teaching and learning wrong, gotten evaluation and improvement wrong, and even gotten reform itself wrong. Kohn does not pull his punches, but doesn't stand on loud opinion. With an engaging style, he often starts by quoting some back-to-basics pundit with one of those sound-bites that can appear so compelling. Then he enthusiastically strips the lies and falsehoods away layer by layer - it becomes entertaining to see him filet yet another contra-reform red herring. For those with a footnote'ish bent he also provides a large appendix containing &quot;the hard evidence.&quot;<br />Kohn does an overwhelmingly convincing job of making a case that leaves a reader realizing that nudging on the small particulars of educational change is simply no longer an option. Something much larger is afoot. Big lies demand clean slates. We might actually do well to trust our own instincts and look at ways of &quot;starting from scratch&quot; - as he entitles his lead-in chapter of the second part of the book. If the first part of the book was an enthusiastic, sometimes angry, fingering of the emperor's nakedly self-serving distortion of reality, this second half is an uplifting overview of all the ways to do education right. He speaks of broad themes such as how to encourage deep thinking and how to bring real decision-making and cooperation into the classroom. He also outlines particulars reform ideas in reading, spelling and math as well as alternatives to grading and standardized tests. As a math teacher, I know there is much more to that one piece of the discussion, but Kohn does a fine job of summarizing the core value in reform approaches. <br />Although the book is split into these two different halves, it is not two distinct pieces - more than simply a dissected pile of lies and a listing of good ideas. Throughout the first part Kohn is forward looking. Each lie of the &quot;Old School&quot;, as he terms it, is exposed in a context of reversibility. This book will open your eyes to a broad and broadening capture of our children's education by ideological pirates, but it will not discourage you on the way. On the contrary it will provide you the courage to grab some rigging and swing into the fray and put the &quot;public&quot; back in public education. Good luck.	2001-06-29

It would be a one-star for me but I've added the extra just from the lurking suspicion that maybe I just didn't &quot;get it&quot;. I'm willing to admit as much but only suggest you consider if you mightn't end up in the same boat...<br />I know Berman to be a writer who presents powerful ideas in an engagingly eclectic fashion from reading his &quot;Twilight of American Culture&quot; - see my review here at Amazon - but I found this book to be incomprehensible and unfocused.<br />In &quot;Twilight...&quot; he ties a clean structure (essentially 'tell em what you're gonna tell 'em - then tell 'em - then tell 'em what you just said) to his eclectic collection of sources and exemplary material - it works. In &quot;Coming to Our Senses...&quot; he does not do that. I'm still not sure what his central theme was (except from reading reviews here, for instance). His ecclecticism overwhelms.<br />I came to this book extremely enthusiastically after reading &quot;Twilight...&quot;. SO it was not through lack of motivation that I just put it down, finally. I will still take a look at his other books in this earlier trilogy - but with caution.	2001-06-28

I'm a 6th grade math teacher whose practice was transformed by this slender little book. Although comfortably into my 40s, I am only now concluding my 3rd year of a new, second, career in middle school math. Four years ago, in the middle of my K-6 Master's program I did a search on &quot;Middle&quot; and &quot;Math&quot; - probably right here on Amazon. There was (and still is) precious little to be found. But I found this book and it was enuff !<br />If you would like to build a math classroom centered around problem-solving - not itty-bitty &quot;word problems&quot; that every kid knows are just dressed-up arithmetic sentences, but real, meaty, challenging mathematics - this is the book to start with. Tsuruda's approach to - &quot;Problems of the Week&quot; or POWs establishes in everyone's mind, from day one of class, that something significant is afoot. The book itself is short, sweet, personal and inspirational.<br />Three years ago I looked around and realized my school system would allow me the freedom to create my own math program. Unlike many younger new teachers, I was not only professionally captured by the alternatives opened by the NCTM reforms of 1988, I found a way to put them into place. I was emotionally able to shrug-off the institutional and collegial pressures toward teaching a traditional program out of a text - to teach, as so many do, as I had been taught. &quot;Problem of the Week&quot; sounded like a great place to center a reform-based program. It is.<br />Tsuruda encourages his classes to create substantial, meaningful write-ups of their problem-solving process and describes the rubric he used to score them. Both supported the notion that the PROCESS of mathematics is at least as important as the PRODUCT. Both write-up and rubric placed only partial value on a final answer... and his 'problems' were such that a single number, so often the end-point of mathematics in kids' minds, was rarely the centerpiece of their answer.<br />Tsuruda acknowledges the hardest part of such a program to be the crushing burden of reading and assessing such a large volume of written work. Furthermore, he states his opinion that falling below some threshold number of POWs in a year significantly diminishes effectiveness of the broad-spectrum of learning goals associated with the approach. From a few years of experience, I would have to agree. This past year I had the unique pleasure of teaching two sections of writing and I'd have to say that the demands of the POW program are greater in many ways.<br />If you are considering a POW-based classroom you should definitely read this book before reading the dryer collections of problems and/or 'technical' books that preach problem-solving taxonomies (although definitely read Polya's book). Be prepared for an, ahem... complex reaction from parents. Few will have seen mathematics in this form and many will, at first, perceive such extensive problems - no matter how simple the underlying arithmetic - as being &quot;too hard&quot;. Naturally that opinion, if spread around at home, can be extremely damaging to the students confidence. This sort of thing is not typical to POW-based math programs but more general in reform mathematics. Nevertheless, you will enjoy having the inspiration of this book to launch you into a rewarding, if sometimes challenging approach to your classroom.	2001-06-28
US	52912007	R1IQRITGSX0T06	0027887251	35595799	The Complete Poems to Solve	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	My 6th graders were not really captivated	I'm not that much of a fan of Swenson's poetry, but I bought this book for my 6th grade writing classes and my rating is largely based upon their reactions to it. Before I ask the kids to write poetry, I try to allow them to read as much as possible. Since many 11-year-olds have little attraction to poetry, this book looked like an interesting addition with it's `puzzler' twist. This did not turn out to be the case. A fair number of students picked out the book, but few stuck with it. After some casual interviews of my students here's what might have been going on:<br />I think the `puzzler' element intrigued many kids but, ultimately, it just didn't have enough \\"oomph\\" for them. They were expecting \\"brain teasers\\" of a more logico-mathematical sort. Furthermore, Swenson's mature poetic language seems to have added a second level of challenge for them. Its not that these kids could never get beyond Shel Silverstein (on the contrary, many leapt toward the books with serious themes), but something about Swenson's Marianne-Moore'ish sparseness added complexity while subtracting words. The puzzles weren't puzzling enough and the poetry was a tad too poetic - for 11-year-olds. (For me too!)<br />It is pretty hard to find powerful poetry appropriate to the range of interests and capabilities of the young-adult. In poetry, as in life, they are sometimes stranded between kiddie-stuff and teen-angst stuff, neither of  which define them so much of the time. This collection does offer something with a certain power and poetic universality, so I'd still suggest it for such a classroom (or family) collection as mine... and perhaps yours.	2001-06-28

If you are a person who is captured by books, by ideas, and especially by their conjunction, you've probably noticed this same affinity for books that demonstrate the same pleasure in crediting their antecedents.  My list for Berman's \\"The Twilight of American Culture\\" was a full page long!<br />Let me say right off the bat, though - Berman is no William Bennett, muscling-in with his insistent, canonical listings or telling you precisely what your 6th grader needs to know (as a teacher I'm especially touchy about that one!). Berman does, in the end, articulate a powerful vision of the importance of  being aware of some of the classic works of western culture. But along the way he takes a peek at everything from the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" to Don DeLillo's \\"White Noise\\" and Miller's \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz.\\"<br />Berman's claim boils down to \\"same old story\\" - civilizations, including ours, move toward decline. This is, itself, something that has been said many times before, back to Spengler and beyond, but Berman's telling is engaging in all sorts of ways. And his proposal for spanning the decline is unique.<br />For one thing, Berman brings a clear-eyed directness to his extensive and eclectic description of the indicators of decline. He acknowledges the important efforts of many individuals to bring about change through personal transformation and grassroots activism, then replies \\"lets not kids ourselves: The ability of these sorts of approaches to significantly deflect the juggernaut of global corporate capitalism in a decade or two is non-existent.\\"<br />A central element of Berman's discussion is, indeed the role played by the corporatization of the planetary culture, the merging of corporate and adolescent ethics, the \\"culture of McWorld\\" as he and others have termed it. In this he differs from many on the political right who havecalled for a return to the traditional values of the \\"western canon\\" while shining the boots of corporate capitalism. Under this economic juggernaut Berman cites four factors that are present when a civilization collapses (a) accelerating social and economic inequality, (b) declining returns from investments in solutions, (c) dropping levels of literacy and general intellectual awareness and (d) spiritual death - packaging of cultural content in formulas, kitsch.<br />Berman does not propose halting or reversing the decline he outlines, but he also does not propose despair. Instead he suggests that we learn from history that decline is sometimes followed by regrowth; that the pace of such rebirth has been hastened or delayed by the involvement of institutions that bridged the dark eras by carrying pieces of  the old into the new. Berman proposes a similar \\"monastic\\" option with more than a casual nod to the uncertainty in either defining or accomplishing such an endeavor.  <br />If you've read lots of this sort of cultural history stuff you might find Berman's treatment glib - certainly not academic; and if you're hip-deep in counterculture you might already have worked out your own gloom and doom scenarios. But if, like me, you've got one foot in each world, only a glossing of classical education and an itching nihilism, this book might be the scratch you're looking for.	2001-06-27
US	52912007	R3SZDVXS81HKJ7	0738202347	418687847	The Physics Of Consciousness: The Quantum Mind And The Meaning Of Life	Books	4	126	130	N	N	A really intriguing book - some truly startling ideas	This book could change your way of thinking about two of the most important realms of your world: what's \\"out there\\" and what's \\"in here\\" - it changed mine. For a book with such an impact, you might wonder why I only offer a stingy 4-stars. My concern is that since powerful ideas, like powerful chemistry, often depend on context (or `medium'), they may only explode on me (on you) if our intellectual medium is currently primed with the right elements. Mine was. Hopefully my writing about the book will help you establish whether it will be a bang or a whimper for you.<br />Walker's book is not just another \\"Tao of Physics\\", not merely another anxious new age gathering of science about the skirts of wishful metaphysics. It combines some of the better points of both, though, to present two startling ideas. Walker's application of these two ideas is to weaving together the strange edges of  `out there' reality, as described by modern quantum physics, with the quicksilver ghost in the machine, the `in there' of your consciousness.  I've seen a few books that attempt this by basically claiming \\"it sure is spooky out there\\" and \\"its pretty strange in here\\" and using little more that wishful thinking to posit a link. Walker does more.<br />The two ideas that Walker's book startled me with can seem simple when stated - you may think you've already thought them. He builds a case for claiming that parts of the biochemistry of the brain are driven by processes, not at the level of chemistry, but at that of quantum physics. Along with this he proposes a mechanism for extending the magnitude of intra-brain communication between neurons to suggest a combinatorial explosion in the already dauntingly large number of possible connections and states in the brain. Around these two ideas he then considers what consciousness might be and hints at linkages between inner to outer.<br />This idea of looking biochemical processes at the quantum level took me by surprise.  If, like me, you'veexplored layperson's introductions to the strange reality characterized by quantum physics, you probably thought of that realm as fundamentally separate from chemistry. After all, its quarks and tachyons and oddly behaving particles and forces and fields are orders of magnitude smaller than that of even an atom, and are rarely described in aggregate - just isolated particles doing odd things. How amazing, then to rise up a level and to look at neuro-chemical processes, mediated by single electrons, and consider the impact of quantum elements on those electrons and those processes. Walker does this quite effectively after an extensive introduction to and overview of the physics and the neuro-chemistry.<br />The second powerful idea, the operational details of which I'll leave to your reading, expands the already demonstrably huge potential of the human brain by many orders of magnitude. Consider the example of 50 people at a party, clustered in twos and threes. At any given time there could be at most 25 or 30 conversations. The opportunity for individuals (and good hosts) to move between groups expands the numbers of interpersonal contacts enough that it could develop into a `good party' over the course of the evening. Now what would happen if all 50 could speak to all the rest and hear what they were saying?  The number of potential conversations explodes to a very large number. Of course the opportunity for chaos is tremendous - but if, somehow, properly coordinated, the prospect for powerful networking is all the greater. Walker proposes such a mechanism for the brain; a way in which each neuron can communicate not merely with the 5 or 20 or even 100 to which it is interconnected, but to any of the other billions.<br />The failings of the book are few, but worth mentioning. Walker appears to want to build his `story' from the outset, around a tale of a lost love (really!). This may be true, or merely a styling that seeks to tie very airy ideas to real folks. Certainly we wonder at such things more often than we do at the workings of neurons. So I kept reading those interspersed segments thinking they would satisfy some other element of the argument, but they never did. Unless you find them engaging you can skip them and stick to the main argument(s). Of course Walker may have just added these bits to give a breather from the heavier going of, especially, the physics. Roughly the first 60% of the book is a pretty serious look at this piece of the argument and it can be slow going at times. I'm a fairly brainy guy, but I have to admit that I would struggle now to recall and outline the details of this piece of the argument. Its important to move beyond mere \\"faith\\" in even a `scientific' claim that things are \\"spooky\\" in the world of quantum physics - but once you are convinced by the science you can move ahead with the revised knowledge that things are \\"demonstrably spooky.\\"<br />The elements that Walker does not belabor gain force by mere suggestion. Important among these is the ultimately-developed notion that some of the counter-factual things that quantum physics states as reality, and their demonstrated association with an important role for observers, are bound through this proposed quantum element of brain chemistry and consciousness. From here we are free, I suppose, to tie-in our own favorite unexplained phenomena - Walker doesn't push it. Although he somewhat overmentions his credentials I don't think he is, actually, a practicing physicist. His back-cover vitae notes, instead, his leadership of a `cancer institute' and we can assume he is professionally interested in mind-body issues and healing. Good for him. This book may take you there or elsewhere - it led me to lots more reading about \\"consciousness\\" - but I'm sure it will move you, someway, into valuable explorations of both inner and outer. Enjoy.	2001-06-26
US	52912007	R1MFGC12HV9B8K	1582430659	97700501	Deus Lo Volt!: Chronicle of the Crusades	Books	1	11	15	N	Y	Might have been a hit in 1300...	I bought this book for a friend whom I knew to be interested in history - and especially intrigued with nitty-gritty detail and the &quot;people's history&quot; approach. I had slogged my way through Connell's earlier &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; and knew him to supply those elements in bundles. After a month, the friend returned it to me saying he had worked hard through 70 or 80 pages but just never got captured by the book; never, in fact, figured out who or what was at the center of this &quot;novel.&quot; He thought maybe I'd enjoy giving it a try. I have done the latter but the former never occurred.<br />Connell uses two somewhat unusual approaches to his topic - I can't honestly refer to it as &quot;his story&quot; - both failed me. <br />Firstly, he chose to write the entire book in the vernacular of the 12th century, perhaps to build an authenticity of tone and character. I'm not talking just &quot;thee's&quot; and &quot;thou's&quot; here - but (apparently) the full gamut of 12th century English syntax. (I wonder if he also considered incorporating the fluid and variable spelling of that era throughout this book. The element of added visual and cognitive confusion would have been similar). It's not really incomprehensible, just rarely engaging. We've all encountered similar difficulties with, e.g., novels that grew from different eras and cultures (Dostoevsky, for instance) and often prefer the form in the original vernacular (consider Shakespeare). But the work of both of these counter-examples is propelled and energized by powerful and engaging characterization and story. <br />This moves us to the second failing of this book. It does not tell a tale in any of the ways (and there are quite a few) that pull me into a book. Once again, this approach may have been driven by some sense of historical accuracy. I've heard that before the modern era the notion of what comprised a fictional story was very different from the modern forms of novel; that writers of that era often \\"told\\" a story in bits and pieces. The \\"glue\\" that bound them together being deep and broadly-shared cultural experiences. Well, Connell tries the same here but the glue isn't to be found. The storyline seems non-existent (at least after the 50-60 pages I read). The snippets of character or events seem truly independent - too much so. I kept thinking, in the first 10-30 pages, that this was some sort of italicized prologue - a flow of consciousness setting piece that would lead-in to the \\"novel\\". Not so.<br />I've gotta say that I have enjoyed this sort of \\"snippet\\" approach to grand themes in the past: Galeano's \\"Memory of Fire\\", for instance. This trilogy captures a sweeping historical theme but starts with a mythic language and culturally-refracted syntax that's quite alien to western ears. In Galeano's case, this serves to launch the rest of the work and to heighten the clashing of cultures that is at the center of his monumental work. Connell's `story' had the potential to accomplish something similar - but falls far short.	2001-06-25
