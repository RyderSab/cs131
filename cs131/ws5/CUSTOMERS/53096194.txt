Though an excellent book in its own right, Inside Hitler's Bunker actually provides only the briefest of glimpses inside the bunker, and even less information about the backgrounds and fates of the people in and around it during the final days of the Third Reich. Instead this short book focuses on exactly what it's original German title says it does: Hitler and the end of the Third Reich. Fest, one of the worlds leading experts on Hitler, here summarizes some of the major themes of Hitler's philosophy (if it can be called that) as it reaches its end, against the back drop of the collapse of his r&eacute;gime. The bunker and its inhabitants are visited only when necessary to aid his tour through Hitler's mind.	2005-09-26

In fact, it's worse in many ways, since the concise and carefully formatted presentation of information in the manual is replaced by extended and sloppily arranged discussions of the same content, which makes it harder follow and much less helpful as a reference. Additionally the physical form of the book -- a stiff but cheaply bound paperback -- makes it less convenient to travel with and harder to keep open for reference while working the camera.<br /><br />(A further note: the book you get will not be the one depicted here. Mine was a D70 only book. No mention of the D70s at all.)	2005-05-26

The bulk of this book is taken up by the script of the film, something that I suspect few readers will have much use for. There are also several short articles and a collection of e-mails to Moore, both of which don't add much that can't be found at various websites. Perhaps the most (or only) useful feature is footnotes indicating the sources for most of the key claims in the film.<br /><br />Disappointing overall, and certainly lacking any of the compelling energy of the film, but useful if you really need to refer back to sources for the film's assertions.	2004-12-02

As the parent of three children, 16, 13 and 10 I have seen the damage homework can do to children's enthusiasm for learning and to my relationship with them. Children need free time to explore their own interests and to figure out who they are. Homework will not solve the too much TV and Video Game problem, but it will quell children's innate desire to explore their world and find out who they are.<br />\\"The End of Homework\\" takes a much needed critical look at the real effects of homework on learning and development and shows just how empty and unsubstantiated many of the claims from the \\"more homework\\" camp really are. Anyone with a stake in the current debate about how children use their time, the changes in the way they grow up, the shift in the balance of power away from families towards corporate institutions, and above all the role of homework in these trends should read this book.	2004-06-14

This is frustrating for anyone who wishes to use the book as a travel guide (though it is always possible to sort out locations by using the text and the limited maps provided) and a serious drawback for the armchair traveler who just wants to get a sense of how Middle Earth maps onto New Zealand.<br />Be sure to get the &quot;Revised Edition&quot;.	2004-04-02

It would also be nice if people could hold opinions like his (let alone write books about them) without doing incalculable damage. Sadly, neither of these dreams is possible, and Szasz's book is both wrong and dangerous. As another reviewer pointed out, this is the sort of thing one is tempted to believe when one is young and seeking simple answers to complex problems.<br />Szasz's makes some valid points about the problems with the diagnoses of mental illness and about the psychiatric profession in general, but his views on the underlying nature of mental illness (a \\"mythological explanation of human wickedness\\") are just false. If you find yourself believing them, I urge you to actually spend some time with someone who has been diagnosed with a mental illness or to read one of the many more useful critiques psychiatry (such as Sydney Walker's 'A Dose of Sanity', which also provides a good survey of dangerous and ill-informed views like Szasz's).	2004-03-17

As a result, it is easy to miss important clarifications (e.g. the extent to which the disorientation of the maintenance convoy that was attacked at An Nasiriyah was an almost inevitable consequence of the Coalition plan and the speed with which it was executed), though the implications are clearly spelled out (support units need better close-combat training).<br />Like many history books published by non-specialty presses, this one suffers from a lack of maps and diagrams. The few maps that are provided, though colorful, are not tied to the text and convey very little information. There are also no organizational charts provided, which is particularly frustrating given the difficulty of following who did what in a campaign that involved so many ad hoc formations.<br />But these are minor issues.

Thought there are a few stunning images of Jupiter and its moons, the vast majority of the images in the book are grainy, artifact-ridden, jagged and blurry images of specific various features viewed far too &quot;close up&quot;. As science book it just passes: the text is very informative and the coverage of geological features is quite extensive; but the images are almost uniformly a huge disappointment. In fact, the cover is probably the best thing about the book.<br />In addition the book is printed on the too-glossy paper of low-quality coffee table books that makes is prone to smudging and glare, so the few decent images the book contains are hard to enjoy.	2003-11-20

But this is it. Though not as lavishly produced as her excellent &quot;Endurance&quot;, Alexander's latest book brings a fresh new perspective to the Bounty story and is not only an essential addition to any Bounty library, but is perhaps also the best first book on the topic.<br />What distinguishes this book is its exploration of the social and cultural web relationships in England that were ultimately responsible for shaping how we see events that occurred far away in what was then literally the end of the world with only a few surviving witnesses -- all of whom had vital interests in how those events were interpreted. Alexander's extensive use of primary sources brings authenticity and immediacy to the story, and here careful avoidance of trying to play detective engages the reader: she lays out quite a bit of evidence and we are left to puzzle out what it means. This is refreshing, as is her through coverage of not only the events on the bounty, but the evolution of the mutineer's settlement on Pitcairn, the voyage of the Pandora, the court marshal proceedings, and the ultimate fates off the entire Bounty crew.<br />Only one minor complaint, which is really not unique to this book, but ultimately makes it much harder to read than it ought to be: because of the tremendous expanse of space and time covered by the events of the Bounty saga, and especially because of the extensive treatment of the web of players, relations, patrons, and other interested parties in the mutiny story, this book could have benefited greatly from more and better maps (there are only three and these are sparsely labeled and mostly decorative) and from some tables (the closest one comes is a simple crew manifest) and charts depicting the social networks.	2003-10-23

Books	2	3	6	N	N	Not as Good as the First Two	The third in the Little Lit series and not nearly as good as the previous two. While the earlier books had each had at least one contribution that would justify the purchase of the book for just about any audience -- from kids reading to themselves, to parents reading to kids, or to avid comic fans of just about any genre or age, this volume is _just_ silly and will probably satisfy none of these audiences. Don't be fooled by the star billing either. Lemony Snicket's contribution is good, but certainly not up to the standards of the Unfortunate Events series. Neil Gaiman's contribution is no Coraline. If you haven't purchased the other two volumes yet, start with either of those instead. If you have them, you may want to skim this one in the bookstore, and leave it there.	2003-10-22

Though the appeal may be quite narrow, this book does a surprisingly good job at what it attempts to do. For anyone who has enjoyed a ride on the Underground, or who has marveled and the (mostly) clean, efficient, and occasionally spectacular Underground stations, Mind the Gap provides a new, fun, and provocative perspective. James takes his camera to all (literally all) those stations that those of us who spend our time in &quot;Zone 1&quot; see at the fringes of the Underground map but never visit. There he captures simple, carefully composed almost documentary images that give us unique view of the history, health, and scope of the Underground system. Though the photographs are individually nothing special (I really could have taken most of them myself, and done better in many cases) the collective effect is balanced and enjoyable.<br />Certainly a worthy addition any collection of Underground books, and a nice alternative for one that already includes the other fine books of photographs of the Underground and its stations.	2003-06-26

Almost always entertaining and well written, this book never really finds its focus. For those seeking a comprehensive an insightful history of the tank, there are glimpses, but not a complete story. For those seeking to understand the tank's role in any particular sphere (from its significance in post-Soviet East Block military culture to the engineering challenges faced in modifying tanks for survival in an era of potent and inexpensive anti-tank weapons) there are hints, but never enough to really sink one's teeth into. In the end one is left a bit dizzy: much is introduced, but no theme is treated in a structured or thorough enough way to contribute much to the reader's understanding.<br />The feeling is that of having met a one of those fascinating and conversation-monopolizing guests at a party: entertaining, and possibly quite knowledgeable, but in the end JUST entertaining -- and a bit exhausting.	2003-04-11
