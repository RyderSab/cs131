I was amazed at the intensity.  I couldn't shut it off, but knew I couldn't listen to it when my daughter was in the car.  <br />Anne was so frank.  There were times when I wondered if she was just being a \\"good actress\\", but then I remember my years being raised in a fanatically religious community (at one point I lived in a commune setting).  Like her, I had also been molested by a family member that I trusted (but definitely not to the extent that she had).  With these two things in common, I could relate to the songs that she sang versus of to illustrate her message as well as techniques learned to \\"escape\\" to torment of her oppressor.  <br />Anne had to overcome a great deal to become a new person.  I have a greater respect for her as a person, as well as a better understanding of her choice in sexual partners.  I applaud her for standing up for what she believes in.	2003-08-05

This is one of the &quot;slowest&quot; reads I've had in a long time.  It felt like labor just to get through it.  I kept putting it down to read other books that were much more interesting, so it took me five weeks to finish.  I kept plugging away, because there would be a hint that it would pick up and get better, but it would slow back down again.  It finally ended leaving me confused as to what happened to one of the main characters!<br />I wanted to read this book because of the subject matter... foreign women who married American GI's after WWII and immigrated to the USA.  This story was written by the daughter of one such couple.  It revolves around three women.  But I found that the lack of dates at the beginning of chapters, or very little reference to time frames throughout the book as it jumped from character to character made the book hard to follow.  For example, when it went back and forth between chapters on Dawn, it was hard to tell if one month or a year had gone by.  Then at the end, it was almost as if the author realized the book was too long, or got tired of writing, and just decided to stop!  We never learn what really happened to Gaynor.  <br />I think this book would have been much more effective if the author had written about one character, even if it meant having a shorter book.  Or written about three separate characters in three separate mini-books combined in one novel, but following that one character all the way through.  Since these characters had very little interaction after the first chapter, that could have been the prologue and then had epilogue to wrap up any connections or to tell what happened to them later.<br />Over all - I would not recommend this if you want to read anything &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;quick&quot;.... so boring!	2002-12-04

I had bought this book to take on vacation, but had such a great time on vacation that I never got around to reading it.  I came home to see an add that this Hallmark made-for-tv movie was going to be playing in a week, so I started reading.  I loved the book!  The movie was &quot;okay&quot;, but I was disappointed how much the movie left out and how it twisted the relationship of Dianne and her ex-husband.  That's Hollywood for you!<br />The book is a wonderful story of a mother with the ultimate love for her handicapped daughter, but  still has so much love to give a neglected girl who befriends her daughter.  I enjoyed reading how the relationship between Dianne and her brother-in-law, a pediatrician, develops as he cares for his neice and is always there for Dianne after his brother desserts them.  A heart warming story.	2001-05-08

Though she reveals within the first few pages that her sister had drowned, The author skillfully uncovered little bit by little bit what happened on that fateful night.  As her neice, Ruth, grows older, her memory of that night also brings more information to light.  There are times when this book moves very slowly, that is why I gave it a lower rating.

Though I really enjoyed this book, at times I found Alice to be so extremely naive that it was almost unbelievable.  To be living in such a rough/hard time, it was amazing that she could remain with such an innocent attitude for so long.

This one will remain on my shelves....I first started this book when I received it for my birthday some nine months ago.  However, it didn't grab me at that time.  Because of this, I hesitated picking it up and starting again.  I was glad that I did.  It reminded me of how young people used to get married, sometimes to people they hardly knew.  The time is never stated in this novel, but I took it to be late 1800's.  I do wish that the writer had listed that.  This book focuses around the main character, Julie Richards, a 17 year old newly-wed.  I usually do not care for men writing from a girl's point of view, but the author made this very believable.  I did not like her husband at first, but as the character developed, I was able to see where the  writer was headed.  He showed the contrasts between the work ethics/habits of Julie and Hank, and how these had developed from their earlier lives under the instruction and control of their parents.	2001-04-17

I enjoyed this story of a young woman's journey via wagon train from Missouri to California.  It was well written and easy to read, however, I found myself wishing for a MAP and kept pulling out the modern day atlas to track their journey.  I wished Ms. Miller had included a rough map of what the territories were like in the period in which this was written.  It would have better emphasized the reading (like Nancy E. Turner did in These Is My Words : The Diary of Sarah Agnes Prine, 1881-1901 Arizona Territories.)<br />I was also a bit disappointed that the author did not write more in the style of the time period (as was so nicely done by Sandra Dallas in the Diary of Mattie Spencer).  The author was a supposed collector of vintage diaries, but her writing did not show this well.  Her wording was too modern and did not reflect how Callie really would have written.<br />I did enjoy the book, but it is a romanticized story, not as realistic as other books I have ready.  It didn't have the full grit that I was hoping to find. I've kept journals for more than 30 yrs, and this did not get personal enough.  It is written like a novel, not a TRUE journal in which people keep their secrets.<br />But if a reader likes a western romance, then this will suffice.	2001-02-27

Being a diary writer for more than 30 years, I am drawn to books written in diary format.  This book portrayed a woman reaching spinster status, who was suddenly asked to wed and travel west to the Colorado frontier by a man she never expected was &quot;interested&quot; in courting her.  The book continues through the travails of cross country travel, including an Indian attach, to settling on the plains where life is hard for anyone to survive, but particularly for her female acquaintenances.  <br />I disagree with a previous reviewer who indicated that author never developed the other characters.  In defense of the author, and from my own journalling experiences, I must state that that reviewer must never have kept a journal.  This format is definitely not for everyone.  But it is a true, one sided, narrative that is very typical of journal writing.  Everything is seen through the eyes (writing) of the main character.  Being in the first person, it is going to be prejudice at times.  But there is also a frankness that cannot be gained from other forms of writing.  I could feel what she was feeling.<br />My only regret was that Mattie took so long to find out why she was chosen a bride to Luke Spencer.  Some reviewers called her a forward thinker, ahead of her times.  But I found her to be completely naive to the the ways of a man and woman.  <br />I don't want to give too much away, but if you like diary style writing, and history of the frontier, read this book!!!!!	2001-02-05

Because I found this to be one of the most boring books I have ever read!  So much so, that I ended up skipping the last 50 pages, then reading the last chapter and didn't miss a thing.  <br />This book was completely repetitive....so we know in the opening pages that Roy Blue Sky gets killed, and shortly after that we learn it is over the gambling casinos on his Indian reservations.  His oldest son, Reese, a retired basketball player, returns to bury his father and find out what really happened.  Reese's old flame, hellen, returns to work in the casino to spot crooked dealers, and her secret is that she kept Reese's son from him all these years.  Reese's brother works for the casino and is in over his head.<br />For the next 300 pages, it goes on and on about Reese and Hellen's relationship and the gaming commission.  Nearer to the end, Reese found out he had a son, and when you think there is some excitement due to the new &quot;conflicts&quot;, it gets resolved much too easily and they become immediate &quot;father and son&quot;.  The investigations seem to get lost in the shuffle of the &quot;romance&quot;.  I personally think this book could have been cut in half and still gotten the point across.	2001-02-05

It was slow moving for me, but it kept pulling me forward.  <br />I had a hard time associated that the author was a man, but the narrator was a woman looking back on her twelth year when her mother was put on trial for the &quot;murder&quot; of one of her patients.  However, the author provided vivid details and wonderful descriptions about the weather in the Vermont countryside and what occurred on the fateful night that made a mid-wife perform a C-section.  Extremely graphic, but amazing description of the C-section made me invision everything.<br />But all the wonderful descriptions could not replace that the book was slow reading.

Once the cheese is gone, he shows again how differently we react when forced to change something we did not wish to change.  <br />After going through many organizational changes at work in recent years, I have seen how each characterization described in this book really does exist in the work environment.

This book, in my opinion, could have been cut in half. The basic plot is about two women who get mixed up after a plane crash, because they had traded seats, and the one to live was mistaken for the other simply because she was carrying the other woman's daughter.  The survivor goes through plastic surgery to repair her disfigured face, and comes out looking just like the other woman.  The rest of the story is about how the survivor then takes on the life of the other so that she can save the husband (a political candidate) from being killed.  <br />That is the basic story.  Throw in between are bits of political campaign, relationship wars in a family pulled apart, and lots of other &quot;stuff&quot; I just found myself skimming through to get to the point of the story.  <br />Brown has matured in her writing, and I've found this book, like many of her earlier ones, to not fit today's standards.  There are a lot of better books coming out there today (look up books from Oprah's Book Club), and I felt like I was wasting my time on this one.

However, I found the book to be filled with just the right amount of intrigued and suspense, filled with turmoil and tempestuous feelings and attractions, that it kept the book alive and moving.  I could feel the anquish of the woman whose husband left her for the conniving younger woman...especially as she destroys everything he treasured that he had left behind.  You can feel for the daughter who feels betrayed by her father, but torn apart by her mother, and used by her sister who relies on her to handle it all.

I kept waiting for this book to get exciting and stay that way.   It would grab me for a brief moment encourage me to read a little further then it would lose momentum.  The narrator is constantly jumping around from past to present.  After a while it became monotonous.<br />I disagree with one of the previous readers about the narrator being the murderor and her reasons for doing so.  But I did feel that the narrator was immature (even in later life) and a liar.  <br />There were so many characters and sub-plots (ie her relationship with her daughters and her mother) but nothing gets fully developed.  I think the author should have consentrated on several aspects instead of trying to pull together in the format that she did.  <br />Generally speaking it was a book I couldn't wait to finish.  But unlike some novels this couldn't be skimmed because it was too easy to get lost....never knowing whether the character is in the present or thinking to the past or dreaming about the future.  I'm glad it is finally done!  <br />It's not a book I will recommend to any of my friends or relatives.  It would bore them to tears and only frustrate them.	2001-01-11

The story traces the relationship of two women, from very different backgrounds, from the time they are pre-teen, into adulthood.  The book starts out in the '80's and recalls songs, books, and historical tid-bits with which I could identify.  The time line fit perfectly with that of my own life.  The lingo was easy for me to relate to.  It was amazing how I could relate to the attitudes and behavior of the main characters, and understand how others around them were relating to them.   The primary setting is Martha's Vineyard, an island that I am very familiar with.  So I was able to picture in my mind all the places she was talking about.  <br />However, for those easily offended, I would not recommend this book.  I raved about this book being one of my favorite to a friend, but also suggested that another relative not read the book because she would find if offensive.	2001-01-04

Usually I have an easy time following both, but I felt that I got bogged down in all that was happening.  I enjoyed the book, but I wanted it to flow faster, to get a move on.  The story line follows a young woman who has been hired to write the biography of an elderly woman.  The older woman's past twists into her present and is explained well, but sometimes I just wanted to reach other pull the story faster.  It was a book I couldn't wait to get through.	2001-01-04

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but book took a rather typical plot (husband leaves wife, wife has to learn to survive on her own with little/no skills outside the home) and turned it into an extremely interesting story.  The main character chooses to open her house to boarders to help pay the mortgage, and must learn to live with different personalities as well as learn to deal with reactions of family and friends to her new situation/decisions.  I kept expecting her to &quot;get together&quot; with King, but there are some other interesting and unexpected twists along the way that took me totally by surprise!  I enjoyed the writing of the author, especially how she puts what the main character is thinking right in line with what is actually said.  It really ads human aspects to the writing! I hope to read more books by Berg.	2001-01-03
US	52495609	RK62VT2K7VXFX	0966620208	848554729	Maggie May's Diary	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not extraordinary	I read this book because it was based in Manchester NH and Wells ME, two areas I know quite well.  It was wonderful to read discriptions of places and be able to picture in my mind exactly the setting.  The story line was not extraordinary, however.  It seems a great deal of books I've read lately are about women who move on with life after their husbands walk out on them.  This one also has a woman going in search of a lost love and how they rekindle old relationships.  The best thing going for it was that it was short, so it was very quick.  I wouldn't have wanted this book to go on much more than it did.	2001-01-03

I enjoyed the story line, and the character, and found them believable.  Sometimes it is easy to see &quot;fiction&quot; as being fantasy, but this story was one that could happen.

I've never been one for sci-fi literature or any types of novels that suggest unrealistic events, but this book made me believe that it is possible to cross back to the past!  I'd read the book to which this is a sequel, and couldn't wait for this book to come out.  I went to the store weekly to check to see if it was out.  I snatched it up and soon as it hit the book shelves.  It did not disappoint!  But don't read it until after you read the first book!	2000-11-14

I found this book AFTER I'd read the Springwater Series (four small books, each about an individual character).  I found references in those books to this, so went in search of this book.  This book set the stage for the Springwater Series.  But it is never too late to go back and gain the history!  I recommend reading this book, then the Springwater Series, then finish off with Springwater Christmas!  I have also seen that a new book, Springwater Wedding is coming out in 2001!  I am impatiently waiting for that book to arrive, and I probably won't be able to wait for the soft covered version.... Because I enjoy this author and this particular series soooo much!!!	2000-11-14

Over time, they all began to run together with similar themes and predictable plots.  I gave this book a chance, and found it to be better than most, but still quite predictable.  Towards the end, it just seemed like she wanted to get it to print, and stopped putting the effort into it.  Great detail in the first few chapters, but it loses motivation.  I wish she had included more historic facts into the novel.  Then it really could have been a learning lesson.	2000-11-08

I read the entire Lancaster Series by B. Lewis, and was amazed by the insites into the world of the Amish.  This book takes the main character away from the Plain folk and brings them to the world of her worldly, wealthy birth mother.  It shows the decisions that she must make to determine where God is leading her.  I recommended this series to my sister-in-law.
