I was not disappointed, fiding the choice of subjects ranging form the famous to the obscure, painting a picture of a Washington long ago. <br /> <br />With many of the more famous buildings in Washington having been built in the last 70 years, there aren't as many older structural pictures to hold up against a view of the current looks.  This is often refelcted by what originally stood on the site, and then the facing page shows what is built on the site now.  Obviously, there are pictures showing the White House, Capitol, and a few other notable buildings to examine for small changes, but the majority of the book features things the average visitor wouldn't normally notice. <br /> <br />To people who have spent some time in this great city, they would greatly appreciate where the modern looks and everyday scenery has come from.  To the average reader, this book would be an interesting coffee table book to entertain the curious.	2005-04-01

While offering her own viewpoint at times, the book nonetheless charts the awareness of a need for women's help in the war effort, to their formation and training, and ultimately how they served their country in uniform. <br /> <br />Filled with anecdotes and photos, there hasn't been a comparable book I could find that allowed me to learn as much about the challenges faced by women against a skeptical military bureaucracy and a population that had misperceptions and stereptyped views at odds with the really important work performed by these pioneering women in uniform. <br /> <br />For its rare subject and helpful information, this book is very helpful to appreciate the efforts of a largely undersung military organization contributing to war's end.	2005-04-01

When France couldn't hold out for longer than two weeks against Germany's invasion, this book makes clear the effort that the winegrowers and the resgions they lived in went through to preserve something central to France's national identity- wine. <br /> <br />Whether discussing the longing of French prisoners in German hands for wine, or the determined efforts of long-established houses to preseve their stocks and traditions in the face of mounting challenges posed by the German and pro-German Grench authorities intent on looting what they could for their own interests.  Some discussion of a moderate amount is paid to the efforts of the heroic French Resistance, whose exploits were truly remarkable and dangerous, and one is able to feel the tension and anxiety that the people in the book felt as times grew worse. <br /> <br />While not a wine afficionado, or a fan of France's official efforts during the Second World War, this book was hard to put down, and the shorter length of this book came far too quickly.  I learned a lot, came away with greater respect for France and its culture, and hope that the authors continue their writing efforts, as long as it's not another wine book.	2005-03-05

VF-41's time in the Tomcat was usually personified with their shootdown of two Libyan MiGs in the early '80s, but their resurgence in the later '90s earned them strong praise after their conversion to the strike fighter role.    Lots of attention is given to the turnaround that the skipper effected with his squadron after a few years of decline.  The turnaround led to the squadron's tasking in the skies over Kosovo against the Serbs in 1999.  The development of a new way to fight, and the need to train the newer, junior pilots into lethal warriors while dodging enemy fire takes up the majority of the book, and readers will come to know the members of the squadron well after Wilcox' treatment.    While not as crisply written as Angles of Attack (by a former A-6 attack pilot from Desert Storm, since he was the author), the book is an uncommon opportunity to get a feel for they way that the Navy operates its squadrons, and the challenges that come with added responsibility and rank.  Overall, the book makes a strong case for the Navy's ability to train and mold its leaders with a new generation of challenges, while making tis subjects all too human.	2005-01-02

Veterans from World Wars I and II, Korea and Vietnam contributed memoirs, sat for interviews, and sent letters that captured thier impressions of their time in uniform. <br /> <br />The book is subdivided so that similar experiences are grouped together.  For example, one chapter deals with the wait for and then the actual homecomings the contributors experienced, whether it was World War I, Korea, or another war.  Another deals with the entry into military life, and the unique challenges that were far different from what they had known in civilian life. <br /> <br />One notable item about the book is its effort to provide a good amount of material concerning women veterans, with stories that span all four conflicts.  While most of them are nursing related, each shares a personal, compelling narrative that shows the strong feelings that came with the jobs they performed, especially those that concern taking care of wounded soldiers away from home. <br /> <br />The 8 CDs that make up the book go by very quickly, and would probably be worth listening to again for the variety of emotions and experiences that are presented.  This was a very worthwhile audio book, and is highly recommended.	2004-12-16

This is no exception, but takes a different twist than most by chronicling where people were, and what they were doing throughout the European theater when World War II ended for them. <br /> <br />Whereas most people think of the war's end as the day the Germans and their allies surrendered, Gilbert correctly notes that for some, it was earlier.  For example, there are personal accounts of people who were liberated from concentration camps, whose war ended with the departure of their guards, and the arrival of their rescuers.  People who were in occupied France, the crowds milling around London, New York and elsewhere who knew that the war was ending, but didn't get the \\"official\\" announcement due to Soviet grandstanding similarly did not need to wait for the formal surrender ceremony. <br /> <br />The contributors that made this book possible came from many affected nations- among them Germany, France, Britain, the U.S., and other countries that contacted Gilbert or whose memoirs allowed him to pinpoint where they were when their war was over. <br /> <br />The analysis of the relevant events book could be a little stronger, and comes off as stiff in most cases.  But this is not a book that Gilbert wrote, per se.  This is one that is best told by the survivors, veterans, and people whose individual stories make the book work.  It is simply the only book of its kind I have found that looks at an event like the end of the war and treats it as more than just an act at a table by military representatives and government officials.  It is, therefore, a useful and insightful accounting of how different people in differnt places experienced the same thing in very different manners.	2004-12-10

In doing so, they succeeded.  Most modern classes of U.S. Naval warships are displayed, from the carriers, to the AEGIS cruisers, Arleigh Burke and Spruance destroyers, the Perry class frigates, battleships of the past, and support vessels.  The pictures range from action shots to tranquil silhouettes against the setting sun, and the selected pictures leave a reader with a strong sense of the worldwide commitment and flexibility that makes the U.S. Navy the envy of the world.<br /><br />This is not a history of the Navy, and doesn't encompass much in the way of naval aviation, training, and so forth.  This is simply the raw, brute strength of the tip of the spear, and for those with an interest in the modern Navy, required bookshelf reference material.	2004-12-10

We were told about the kite in lightning, he was at the conventions that produced the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, and romanced all the ladies of Paris while he was our ambassador there.  That's not quite the real story as Isaacson presents it. <br /> <br />Founding Fathers have been making a comeback of late, with John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and George Washington also having been documented of late.  This one admirably covers the life story of the most diverse figures in America's history, and the only one in the aforementioned list not to have served as an official of the early U.S. government. <br /> <br />The book chronicles well the humble beginnings of Frnaklin's life, beginning in Boston, and his oft-remembered running away to Philadelphia.  His subsebquent adventures and activities, from his common-law marriage, social activities, scientific interests, and professional activities stemming from printing and postal work are interestingly explained, adding life to the man we knew.  The real meat of the story comes from Frnaklin's involvement in the growing friction with England, as he set out at first to seek ways to mend the relationship.  It was his invaluable role once the die was cast for independence that sets him apart. <br /> <br />While Washington led the troops and (Sam) Adams led the propaganda, Franklin helped to draft the Declaration, and then was hustled off to France to help the American cause.  Isaacson makes the case that it was Franklin that was the strongest advocate and most successful due to his international prestige and respect for France.  Nonetheless, the book reveals the real story about Franklin's rumored activities while in France, and makes the man more human than your old textbook by noting his medical infirmaties and their effect on his life. <br /> <br />Franklin usually leaves our consiousness after Paris, and then after the Consitutional Convention in 1787.  Yet he was an active participant in political and social affairs until his death, and the extra effort to show his acitivity after these famous periods of his life add to his luster. <br /> <br />Frnaklin comes across as a thoughtful leader, with both tragic and touching family relations, all while helping to steer the fledgling nation towards a stable and prosperous future he helped to create.  All in all, an interesting book on an intriguing patriot.	2004-11-29

It focuses strongly on the period after 1990, when the team successfully finished it seasons among college's best year after year. <br /> <br />With stories that last only a few paragraphs or so in most cases, this will entertain a Seminole fan for a short while, but it won't satisfy a desire for an in-depth look into the football program that Bowden has built over his successful, long tenure at FSU.	2004-11-29

Ted Lawson's book Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo that was made into a movie.  Now, more people recall it for the historically inaccurate rendition it was given in the movie Pearl Harbor.  For the real story with more to offer than Doolittle's own biography and Lawson's earlier work, we have The First Heroes. <br /> <br />This book solidly provides the historical background of two important factors.  One, the career of air pioneer Jimmy Doolittle, who commanded the raid, and two, the war's progress to that point and the reason the raid was needed. <br /> <br />A thorough (but not dull) description of the challenges facing the unit formed for the raid is provided, as are the issues that developed as training was winding down in preapration for the raid.  The relationship that grew between Doolittle and his men is notable, and also touching is the way that the sailors on the carrier Hornet grew from disdain to admiration when the bomber crews came aboard for their mission. <br /> <br />A blow by blow account of each of the 16 planes launched is given, as are the struggles each crew faced in getting back to safety.  Information is given on how each crew fared, and the end of the book does a great job at providing an epilogue that tells the reader what happened to each Raider in the years that followed the mission. <br /> <br />No matter how you look at it, the mission was challenging and mind-boggling then, and 60-plus years later, should still inspire us with respect for the sacrifices made on our behalf so long ago.	2004-11-10

The end result from having read this book was that I came out wanting more information, since if one looked at the book on the outside, one would expect a bit more than was delivered.<br />With 304 pages offered, I had hoped for most of that to be centered upon the experiences of the Soviet submarine fleet as it grew into a force that caused the West no shortage of concern. However, the amount of material on the Soviet submarine service was understandably limited, and depended   heavily upon only a few people who had significant experience at the end of the Cold War, as opposed to the beginning and turbulent middle. What seemed like the last third comes in the form of an unusually informative analysis of Soviet naval doctrine as seen by Admiral Gorshkov, and a primer on the many individual sumarine varieties that were fielded by the Soviets during the Cold War.<br />There were a few semi-lengthy stories about specific incidents, but it repeated what can be found in many other books, including the far more revealing Blind Man's Bluff. It did not have the detail about the daily lives of the crew and challenges such as was found aboard U.S. subs in Big Red. It did have some discussion on the poor construction of the boats and the political interests outweighing sound employment of these critical naval assets, but it didn't dwell too long there.<br />The value of this book is that is one of very few references on the Soviet submarine service, but it is not authoritative enough that it can be consulted often. Still, it does add to the growing list of available sources on the \\"other side\\" of the Cold War, and thus sheds just a little more insight.	2004-04-16

Both were similar in their interests in government and politics, and were very ambitious.  Yet, the two men grew toward each other with the passage of time, and by the Second World War, were able to respect the other's personality and intelligence greatly.  Whether it was in their late-night drinking sessions as they dreamed up ideas and hatched plots, or aboard their ships off Newfoundland, or to their secret conferences in Casablanca or Teheran or elsewhere, it was the closeness of these two men that formed the glue that bound the Anglo-American alliance against the Axis.<br />This book warmly portrays both men through the author's access to letters, diaries, and people who knew them, and admirably makes both men stand out as if alive.  When confronted with the most challenging decisions and situations a leader could ever face, these were two of the greatest the world has ever known, and Meacham has done a brilliant job desribing not only the situations and potential repercussions, but also the two men, their countries and their friendship we still hold dear to this day.	2004-04-16

There is actually much more, and as a result, it can get extremely dull if you weren't planning to listen to descriptions of trade winds, and the settlement by the Dutch in the 1500s, geology expeditions in Greenland, and what the towns in  Java/Indonesia were like in the 1500s, 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s, to the point when the volcano erupted in the 1890s.<br />Of course, the author probably knows quite a bit about tectonic geology, but the slow pace and overkill applied to background information killed this book for me.  I wanted to read about the things described on the book's back cover, and when it took 2/3 of the book to get there, my patience was nearly over.  The actual description of the volcanic explosion is really anticlimatic, and if you're still listening at that point, the letdown colors what follows.  I was very disappointed, and didn't want to be.<br />I had really hoped for an interesting story, but given the long length of time it took to reach fruition, I would definitely NOT recommend this book to anyone unless their interests lay in studying rocks in their spare time, or saying in 10 CDs what oculd be done in three.  (6 CDs were trivial background of little importance, 4 were the explosion and aftermath, of which 1/4 of that material was way too dry).	2003-11-26

No Higher Honor covers from before Pearl Harbor to its sinking by the Japanese, to even including a epilogue that details the lives of some of the men who are featured int eh book to provide readers with an opportunity to learn what became of the crewmwn of the Yorktown.  The author's discussion of some of the thousands of crewmembers and their stories is natural and gives a reader enough of an appreciation for each to make the full story that much more urgent as events unfold.<br />The discussion of luck, fate, duty and honor shared between the carrier Yorktown and her crew is also especially recommended for school-age students that need resource material or some kind of understanding about what is increasingly getting littler amounts of ink in high school history courses.  I would urge that this be used in school libraries and recommended for readers seeking to learn about the difficulties that come from conflict and their human costs.  By the end of the book, readers will definitely have a much greater appreciation for the challenges that came from service, the sacrifices stemming from war, and the humanity that bound the whole thing together.	2003-11-26

The organization, originally conceived of by Ryan, does the dirty work that the FBI and CIA are legally not allowed to do.<br />Developments in our world (9/11, and the Department of Homeland Security, for example) that never were a part of the infrastructure in any other Ryan books now appear as if this book simply replaced the actual president and put the Ryan characters in place, seemingly ignoring the past events that took place in the fictional realm.  It was a little disconcerting, but given that it's fiction, you have to just accept it and move on.<br />The actions taken against the terrorists in this book certainly are something a Ryan fan would approve of, but the book seems to be a little jarringly laid out, and a less than satisfying attempt to introduce characters that will allow Clancy to keep writing books in the series for years to come.	2003-08-17

The book centers around Harry and his much-increased troubles over the summer and especially back at Hogwart's.  Chased by his enemies and people who don't believe his claims, he spends a lot of time trying to survive the changes in school faculty and the issues that seem destined to wipe him out.  His cohorts all return, each with their own new challenges that add to their time being drawn away from being able to help Harry, but somehow finding a way to prepare together for their dreaded exams that will dtermine their magical careers ahead.<br />For children, this is too dark a dark book to be introduced to Harry effectively, but no problem if they have read the previous books.  It still retains the power to enthrall a reader, though, and leaves us waiting for a resolution down the road we won't see soon enough.  On a very happy note, it will certainly entertain your youngster for a long car trip quietly, or yourslef for some good escapist reading.	2003-08-04

Centered around the friendship between for members of the 1940s Red Sox (Dom Dimaggio, Ted Williams, Johnny Pesky, and Booby Doerr) as it takes them from their minor league days to Ted's passing, this was an absolute delight.<br />At 220+ pages, this was written very well, showing a clear love of the game and the era that produced major leaguers with loyalty to their team, town, and each other.  It was filled with examples of the men's backgrounds, their ballplaying days and good and bad times off the field.  The book itself centers around the long drive down the East Coast for two of the players and a friend to Florida, where Ted is close to the end.<br />Baseball has an ability at times to rear up and remind us how much of a pleasure it is to be aorund a game that is wholesomely American, and the joy of our youth.  David Halberstam's book also does that much better then many other baseball writers I have read, and for that I give this a rare 5 stars.	2003-06-09

In this book, the older, up to 150-year old photo of the original structures on the current site, or older pictures than offered a juxtaposition of the surrounding landscape of buildings present in the past and now around selected sites.<br />While I was a little disappointed in no picture of Fenway Park, or in a map to help locate where some of these pictures were taken in the city (after all, I'm not a native of Boston), I found the book to very ably support the exhibits we saw on Boston's history, and add greatly to my understanding of the city and the growth of urbanism in general.  The architecture depicted is often unique, and the descriptions offer a bit of information on who the architects were, how the areas shown were constructed, and more.<br />Overall, I came out pretty pleased by what is found in this book.	2003-05-28

From discussions on early debates on slavery, to Washington's departure from public life, to the background of Hamilton's clash with Aaron Burr, there is much more here than is usually reported about these illuminating incidents.<br />Where the book lost me was its reliance on seeking the perfect words, phrases and more, making the book less enjoyable then reading David McCullough's John Adams or other books on these contemporaries.  While informative, this bent towards an overly academic prose style will not make the book easy to sit down and read for the avergae historical reader.<br />This book is best used in sections for its further information on incidents that shaped our early democracy.  While well-researched, it is hard to read straight through without needing to pause for some time and for occasionally more caffeine.	2003-05-28

The book does exactly as its title indicates, and tries to cram in enough details on the wars and conflicts of the U.S. military in the 20th Century to give a decent overview.<br />Strategies, commanders, and campaigns are recounted, from the World Wars to Cold War actions.  Desert Storm is given some treatment, but it is limited having been written about so closely to the publication, prior to the hindsight provided by additional passage of time.<br />Overall, the book is a useful first reference to get someone started in their understanding of the conflicts faced by the military, and how the American military system grew into its pre-eminent role it has today.	2003-05-16

Included were some of the details of the development of the modern nuclear navies, and the operations they have engaged in and the men who operated them.<br />My chief enjoyment from the book came from its simplicity, and lack of technical jargon that allowed me to cruise through each page easily.  Having read a bit about submarines, I was able to pick up on the occasional new item, but if someone wanting a lot of details about what it takes to be in the silent service, then I would look elsewhere.<br />Despite these detractions, it will occupy a spot on my bookshelf and be loaned to friends if they are seeking an interesting book on today's submarines.	2003-04-28

It's not chock full of theoretical jargon, and offers enough useful, thoughtful cases to be more easily understood than most.  Still, for a novice with an interest in how policies are made, I would strongly recommend choosing a book by someone with a great deal of experience in government writing about their experiences- without the accompanying course I took this would have been of little value.  Still, its recency is helpful, and the author writes well enough to be almost enjoyable.	2003-04-27

Obviously, as a general handy reference on WW2, this book can help you fill in the gaps of your memory with a strong attempt to explain the conduct of the war.  But for that very reason, this one volume work is not going to be able to focus on unit movements and small details as specific books will provide.<br />Beginning with the invasion of Poland to the signing of the surrender aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, the book tries valiantly to include as much as possible.  When used in conjunction with other similar books, a very strong picture of the overall war can be achieved.  On its own, it is a very helpful reference, but obviously is limited in space.<br />Of the several overview book on the war I used for class, I preferred the simplicity of the Idiot's Guide to World War II more, but this was far more scholarly and liekly to be read as a book by someone seeking to learn a great deal more.	2003-04-26

The level of involvement on the part of President Eisenhower did suprise me a little, especially the way in which the flights before the shootdown were somewhat routine, with Soviet complaints being easily dismissed.  It is the shootdown, and the results both immediate and long-term, that dominate the majority of the book.<br />The timing could nothave been worse- it was the last scheduled flight before a summit between the two superpowers, and Khruschev was at the Moscow U.S. Embassy for an Independence Day celebration as the shootdown unfolded.  The repercussions were potentially enormous, as the U.S. lost prestige, leverage, and the ability to continue to operate the program once it came to light.<br />Beschloss writes very well, and this early effort of his is certainly worth the time it will take to find it and read it.	2003-04-14

Lt. Gen. Pagonis' book does attempt to offer some insight into the challenges of supplying the Army's needs as it built up during Operation Desert Storm in 1990-91, and then through Desert Storm.  Very little is said about the withdrawal process of Desert Farewell.  <br />The problems with this book are that it is too much centered around a business school philosophy book- not to take too much away from the success that Pagonis had, but it seems less about the challenges of supply in a hostile environment than a depiction of how to solve problems.  I greatly respect the efforts and solutions that Pagonis encountered and defeated, but wish this was more a military-oriented book and less of a business school effort.<br />Regardless of these issues, Moving Mountains will give a reader some appreciation for all of the tasks and unsung duties by the rear echelon forces in combat, and how the Army has developed its ability to deal with any potential environments it may find itself in the future.	2003-04-01

Overall, it doesn't go into great detail or too much about the belowdecks supporting uints that allow flight operations to exist.  What it does offer is a retrospective of carrier operations from before World War II, a decent amount on World War II operations, and then the Cold War carriers that continue serving on until today.  There is some information on the British and French carriers, but it is very limited.<br />Overall, this book is introductory, and best serves as illustrating a challenging world in a coffee-table book format.	2003-04-01

That's part of the reason that they have been so successful, and why this book does a lot to reveal what the world of the Special Forces is like.<br />Tom Clancy crafted a very readbale book on the inception and inevitable growing pains of the U.S. Special Forces.  He does this mostly by relating the career of Army Special Forces General Carl Steiner, and illustrating the text with well-written accounts of highlights in the evolution of today's special combat forces.  From missions involving terrorism, in combat during the Cold War and its present employments worldwide, the special forces have faced enemies abroad and at home, as the book notes opposition from &quot;traditional&quot; commanders opposed to sharing resources and losing some of the best soldiers.<br />Overall, the book jumps from example to background, to example, and it does not detract from the story whatsoever.  Since Clancy has started his examination of military leadership, he has written surprisingly well, given his fictional focus before. Readers will easily come out of this book impressed with the operators he describes, and better understanding of the special challenges faced by the men and women of the Special Forces.	2003-04-01

This story of a patrol in the USS Nebraska, an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine, is unusual in its level of access that the author was granted to chart the course of a patrol through its sailors and officers.<br />The U.S. Navy is rare in that its crews, especially on the &quot;boomers,&quot; will sail for months underwater and still have few problems while at sea.  The book does a credible job at describing the feelings of the men being away froh home and everyday things, as well as noting what goes on back home with their families.<br />The inevitable drills, maintenance issues and daily life aboard these submarines are described, as are the hopes of the men aboard that their mission never comes to pass.  Big Red is a thoughtful account, but could use a little more revision in some of its facts and details.  This is not meant to slam the book, since there are very few out there describing the silent service of today so thoroughly, but is just a general criticism.<br />As an interesting and informative work about the world of many of our young people in an elite, all-volunteer undersea world at work, this book deserves a spot on the submarine fan's library shelf.	2003-04-01

He told me about hinding out the book was being written, and then he supplied it to my cousins so that he could give them some idea of what he had been up to during the Cold War.  He didn't actually tell them a lot himself, but what little told me also was EXTREMELY intriguing.<br />People really have so little idea of the amazing things that were going on in different areas during the Cold War.  Blind Mans Bluff goes back to the very early days and relates some early adventures, and moves us forward to the end of the Cold War with mind-blowing examples throughout.<br />Through interviews with American and Soviet submariners and their families, this book was hard to believe, and harder still to put down.  The History Channel used the book as a basis for a prime-time documentary, and although it didn't relate all of the examples used in the book, it still left us shaking our heads and what was actually going on while we were blissfully unaware.<br />For an exciting and unusual reading selection about the Cold War, and some people who have been very good at remaining silent about their extraordinary service, this book would do the trick.	2003-03-15

In this effort, Ambrose focuses his attention on future politician George McGovern's involvement in World War II as a B-24 pilot, along with his crew and unit.<br />The book details the crew's coming together, training, off-duty life once they reach the Italian base they'll fly from, and the missions they flew.  Obviously, the overall story will appear somewhat similar to other books that discuss the air war against Germany, like Astor's The Mighty Eighth, or other such efforts.<br />On the plus side, McGovern is a true gentleman warrior throughout, and his exploits deserve telling, as do nearly all of the stories about the grand crusade of World War II.  The action is well written, and the book itself is enjoyable.  The true downside is that after going through many of Ambrose's works, I guess I expected a bit more.	2002-12-04

Along the way, he manged to see the height of the Wehrmacht after seizing Czechoslovakia, Poland, and France; he also chronicles the downturn of fighting in Russia, and then witnessing the collapse of Germany, even as he tries to defend Berlin against the Russians, all while having to brief Hitler and his aides on the hopelessness of the battle.<br />Knappe also describes his being captured by the Russians, and his treatment during his years of captivity.  Given that he survived, and most of the German soldiers captured by Russia did not, his is a rare account of what is was like to be a POW after the war had been over for more than five years in a gulag.<br />The story is simply told, and is not the most compelling or gripping nonfiction ever written, but as it is written in a German soldier's persepctive, this book warrants attention and would be an appropriate addition to a balanced study of World War II.	2002-12-03

Upon opening the book, the familiar illustrative style and in many cases, the whimsical, lyrical poetic style found in his children's books jump out.  It is only as you examine deeper that you can really settle in and appreciate what the book compiled together.<br />In these cartoons Seuss mocks Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, and stereotypes present in the American culture of the 1940s.  He has cartoons on domestic subjects, foreign policy acts and blunders, and the Second World War in general.  Here you see Yertle the Turtle before we knew it was him, and other characters that we met in later books.<br />My history students, of course, were initially thrilled to see more of Dr. Seuss' work, having grown up appreciating all that he did.  But then, as we discussed what message and or/event was being referenced in individual cartoons, they grew appreciative and even more interested.  I really like using this book.	2002-12-03

The full gamut of the horrors of American slavery are described, whether it was being beaten, raped, or having your family split apart for different masters to take away.  The living conditions and variety in their treatment also are discussed, making this book, while simple enough to be read by middle schoolers, powerful enough to be read by anyone seeking a true account of slavery prior to the Civil War.	2002-12-03

The lives of Custer and Crazy Horse are compared throughout the book, noting their seemingly parallel lives to reach the ultimate clash that was the Little Big Horn battle.  Crazy Horse was a sharp contrast to the flamboyant Custer, and their ultimate fates were also impossible to predict in their early days.<br />Throughout the book, the issues that shaped Western growth and expansion are addressed, as are their effects on the lives of these two men.  There is a short section that follows the climactic battle, deatiling what happened after Little Big Horn for many of the people described in the book at one point or another.<br />A reader expecting another book similar to one of his World War II efforts might be disappointed, but it should be remembered that Ambrose didn't have veterans to discuss experiences with- only records and long-dated transcripts.  As such, this is a much more difficult book to write, which should be taken into consideration.  However, the book is not as well-written as the World War II books, which obviously benefitted from earlier writing experiences such as this.  Overall, the book will teach you a lot about the Western settlement and its effects, and especially about two famous Americans that inevitably will be linked for all of history.	2002-12-03

The chapter on air power alone makes Germany's defeat seem a certainty, although it played out over six years and involved a cast of millions.  Overy works very hard to provide statistics, analysis and details that blend together very well, and teh end result is that the book offers an extremely well-written series of arguments as to why the Allied Forces prevailed.  Although it may be out of print, as research is concerned, this would greatly help its reader compile the data needed to make any good case for the Allies's success in World War II.	2002-12-03

He provides details about all aspects of the Nazi rise, and implementation of their beliefs and dogmas upon the people.  The sheer size of the book, coupled with its small text, can be daunting for some readers at first, but the book's well-written and organized effort make it very compelling and authoritative so many years after its first publication.  We used this book in my International Baccalaureate class, and only in specified selections, but the book was so well-written and compelling that most of the students went back and read what they didn't have to afterwards.  This book would serve anyone well seeking information on how Nazism took hold, how it ruled its people, and what caused its inevitable problems.  Shirer's unusually lucky access to all that happened as a witness makes this a fantastic resource.	2002-11-27

After having thoroughly enjoyed the previous tapes and book in Reaching for Glory, Michael Beschloss again delivers an amzaing account of President Lyndon Johnson's years during the continuing entanglement of Vietnam and the Civil Rights years.  Also featured are the interesting relationships he had with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Kennedy, and a horde of other notables that characterized the 60s.  The tapes leave little out- to LBJ's private worries about Vietnam, the behind-the-scenes arm twisting and politicking, and the issues of elections and affairs.  Michael Beschloss' book itself is good reading, but for the true feeling of the subject material, listening to these tapes of his many secretly recorded conversations is much more revealing a look.	2002-11-27

This book is also rarer since the platform he flew, the A-6 Intruder, has been retired despite several advantages over its replacement, the F/A-18.  The book describes the working up period prior to deploying to the Arabian Gulf, shipboard life, as well as the buildup and actual fighting done during Desert Storm from his carrier.  The wrting isn't as gripping as a professional writer would do, but nonetheless is an authentic account from a unique source.  Overall, I was gald to have had the opportunity to learn more about what makes combat and naval aviation so much more different than what land-based forces go through.  As a book to throw in your bag for a weekend reading source, this will be fine.	2002-11-26

What I found as I listened was superb writing, with seamless crossovers between one story ot the next.  The text, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Morris, is fantastic.  The reader does a great job at keeping a listener entertained, with decent efforts at replicating TR's unusual voice that I have only heard a few times as a history teacher.  This book covers up to his presidency, so anyone who is looking for the background on some of the major issues that he dealt with as a president will be frustrated, only to learn that his follow-on book Theodore Rex covers that part of TR's life, with a third book to follow later.  This one deals with TR's childhood (what an amazing person, even as a young boy), his education, and career.  It's doubtless anyone could so easily accomplish all that he did in the same manner in today's society, making him a unique, emblematic representation of one of the United States' most incredible personalities in its history.  I highly recommend this book, and especially the CD if you find yourslef about to take a trip in the car for a length of time.  The CDs take 9 hours, and every one of them holds your attention and causes you to marvel at the early years of Theodore Roosevelt- just a fantastic book!	2002-11-26

Few remember that it was Tom Clancy that made the Cold War technothrillers break out in the 1980s.  Yes, Jack Ryan is back, and in a \\"prequel\\" mode, but the fact is that reading this book brings back the haunting \\"Evil Empire\\" and all of its former sinister implications. The book does take its readers back into the way life used to be for many of us, and adds an unusual twist of creating historical fiction around the attempted assassination plot against the Pope. Overall, I had been disappointed by the increasingly fantastic scenarios in Clancy's Ryan books, and this one seems to go back closer to the way it began.  Trust your instincts, and if the last few books seemed a little bizarre, then this should put the world closer to its rightful place in your mind.	2002-11-25

In this case, this is the photo we know the least about what happened during its capture, and of the people involved.  For a first effort, this book is a strong surprise by Bradley, son of one of the men pictured raising the flag.  The stories of each of the men involved, before the war, during, and after, is well-told, as is the effect of being in this famous photo.  The description of the conditions in which the battle took place that led to the photo are similarly poorly known.  Flags of our Fathers does a very good job bringing what appears to be just a photo of American Marines in World War II to vivid life, and is well worth the read.	2002-11-25

The Gilded Age homes and lifetyles are lavishly depcited, using hundreds of photos and basic, supporting text that will adequately portray the subject intended in the book.

Although most remember him for the Tokyo bombing raid if 1942 (see the movie Pearl Harbor for his latest incarnation), Doolittle was responsible for many of the safety measures now taken for granted by pilots in the world today in the early daus of test flying in the Army Air Corps.  He left the service, did some private consulting, and when World War II loomed ahead of us, he returned to duty, rising to a position of senior leadership in the war in Europe.<BR>Doolittle achieved great success in the air, but this book will also teach the reader about his scientific abilities, and his corporate roles played in life, as well as his influence on some major policy movements in the US Government and the military after his retirement.<BR>For just the story on his involvement in the Tokyo Riad, this would be well worth the read.  However, this book is much more than that, and very well told by a modest, gentleman warrior of a different era.<br />For another account of the Tokyo Raid, I would suggest Ted Lawson's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.	2001-12-12

US	52845843	R8CAILRCSMSAP	0684829495	339554706	Inside the Third Reich	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very rare autobiography from a Hitler insider	Although doubts about the honesty of some of this material are possible, it shold be noted that Speer was one of very few Hitler insiders and confidantes to survive the Nuremberg Trials and then write openly about his experiences.  The opening pages describe his growth to adulthood, and his initial exposure to the man he would call Fuhrer.<br />Speer initially caught Hitler's attention as an architect, which would appeal to Hitler, whose earlier years had also been about creation and design as an aspiring artist.  Hitler brought on Speer to help him transform Germany and especially Berlin into what Hitler thought would be a home for a 1000-year Reich.  Speer's designs were grand, imperial and bombastic, and this appealed to Hitler's sense of Germany' greatness.  <br />Hitler turned over greater responsibility to Speer as his need for syncopants grew, and especially as those who lied to him failed to live up to their promises delivered in fear of his wrath.  During World War II, his role as armaments minister did prove to be successful, as the quantities of produced war goods rose.<br />Overall, though, he represents well the growing paranioa that Hitler developed, and how it did in the Nazi system.  The subsequent loss of the war, and the trials held after that, were important to Speer's story asd he was one of very few senior administrators to escape have sentences or death in Nuremberg.<br />This is an intersting book, and is well worth the time taken to read it.	2001-11-30

This book is very engaging, and a reader will find it hard to stop reading.  It becomes so apparent that Nicholas was absolutely the wrong person at the wrong time, and Massie is very adept at showing why this misguided ruler was undone by a violent revolution.  One can easily notice that Massie is sympathetic to his subjects, and has a slight bias against the revolutionaries such as Lenin and Trotsky who ultimately had him killed.  Overall, this book does a fantastic job of keeping a reader's interest, and is lushly provided with flowing descriptions of life for all of the people of Russia and the growing revolution that would undo the reign of one of Europe's oldest monarchies.	2001-11-30

The men and women that are discussed in this book were subjected to torture, intentional infections and medical experimentation, saw their comrades used for target practice and suddenly beheaded, and worse.  It is amazing that so many of these brave souls survived the conditions described.  This book would complement the 2001 effort by Hampton Sides, Ghost Soldiers, very well.  Sides' effort, one of the best history efforts I have ever read, is about one camp in particular, while this book is about the Japanese system as a whole.  Daws was given a lot of testimony from the folks in famous (the river Kwai area, for example), and the obscure camps throughout Asia.  The memory of this book will lat with you a long time, and make you appreciate not only the veterans of the time, but also the comforts of modern society achieved at great cost.	2001-11-28

From Winston Churchill's famous broacasts to Ronald Reagan, from the landing on the moon in 1969 to Thomas Edison making the first recording of Mary Had a Little Lamb, this has a lot of interesting and useful things. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech is included; JFK's inaugural address still resonates with hope this many years later. The selections included four themes: the political arena, the changing world, the dreams/ inspirations/ accomplishments, and the best of times, and the worst of times. The last includes Neville chamberlain's hopes that war in 1939 would be avoided, followed immediately by his announcement that war has begun. Some of the selections are edited into shorter lenghts, which can be unfortunate, but overall, the collection is outstanding. If you are a history buff, or curious as to what makes a good speech, this set will prove very useful.	2001-11-28

The pictures from the tragedy do not contain any shots of people hurt or facing harm, which could be potentially upsetting, but does contain imagery of the Pentagon and World Trade Center aftermath. The most stirring pictures are those of Americans being proud of who they are, including firemen and everyday citizens who decided it was time to dust off their flags and hoist them once again. All in all, this is a very timely and poignant reminder of what happened, and who we are. It would make a very good gift to remind others as well.	2001-11-28

There are some new chapters that deal with people Ambrose has been freinds with for several years, but the overall goal of the book is to allow a reader to see the value of bonds of friendship among men in history.  Examples include Dwight and Milton eisenhower, people of Easy Comapny (Band of Brothers), Custer and Sitting Bull, and others.  This moves quickly, since it is not in-depth, and can be read in one evening if really attempted.  The writing is sharp and lyrical, well-done, but readers should not expect a thick, detailed effort more common in all of Ambrose's works.  Call this one the greatest hits, or even the &quot;flashback&quot; book, such as TV shows use to look back on their long run of shows and their favorite moments.	2001-11-28

This is another of his thinner &quot;compilation&quot; efforts, but contains more new material than does Comrades.  It is very interesting to read, but its shorter nature does not allow readers to answer all of the questions they may have.	2001-11-28

While captured, he had to endure sporadic communication with his family back home, including a marriage that broke apart, and the treatment of fellow POWs who were friends, and family, to him.<br />Accompanying illustrations help to show how dramatic the story is.  Since it is not written in a complex manner, it can fairly retell the story of what he went through before, during and after his ordeal as a POW to any audience.<br />I recommend this book to my students who want to learn about this painful chapter in American history, and am very impressed that any human being can absorb that which men like Alvarez and John McCain were forced to do.	2001-11-24

It will not discuss his presidential ambitions in 2000.  But it will provide a reader with a lot to think about, and a fantastic story.<br />Sneator McCain's experiences in Vietnam are pretty well known, but the full story is not.  Few people would know there is a destroyer named for his father, and that his grandfather was an admiral in Nimitz' fleet.  Yet the short time discussing these two important men in his life provide just a further glimpse into what made John McCain into the person we see on TV today.<br />Following such a tradition as his family started does not appear daunting from what he writes.  yet, he accepted his family's calling, and although he did not rise in rank to equal his namesakes, he did serve in just important a fashion, and in a more individually trying way than they did- as a Vietnamese POW.  <br />McCain's experiences in POW camps is gripping.  It is painful to hear some things decribed as they were, yet the painful parts are obviously necessary to tell the story.  And the story could have had a much different ending had McCain chosen to allow his captors to use him for propaganda against his father, a major military leader during the Vietnam War, by releasing him.  Yet McCain did not, and his example he showed then still resonates to day as a model for leaders to follow.<br />This is a very intersting account of Senator McCain's background, and the small sections on his grandfather and father make it much more compelling.  This book deserved your attention.	2001-11-24

Werner joined the German Navy at the outset of World War II, and was able to rise through the ranks fo this extremely dangerous calling to command his own U-Boats by the end of the war.  Werner writes his account from a chronological perpsective, from the early, easy successes to the end of the war and the bleak outlook Germany had ahead of them.  Key events like the &quot;Happy Time,&quot; the sinking of the Bismarck, the Battle of Britain and operation Sea Lion figure in, as do the attacks on Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and the waning days of the war.<BR>Iron Coffins also exudes humanity, finding fault with the Nazi high command and the naval leadership that caused too many losses, weakened morale, and doomed Germany's effort.  The title itself refers to Werner's view of the U-boats as floating deathtraps for most of their crews (perentage-wise, German U-boat crews had one of the top positions in any list of potential losses).  <br />Werner was lucky to survive, given his job, and we are luckier still to have his account of U-boat work in World War II.	2001-11-22

Most of us were never lucky enough to have had him as a professor, but this book will easily allow him to be your teacher.<br />The amazing, grand scope of the Lewis and Clark journey is usually confined to a short paragraph in our American History textbooks.  We can try to imagine what it was like, but Ambrose shows us that our imagination barely scratches the reality of what was the most amazing journey I have ever read about.  The challenges, conflicts and new experiences faced by the party of men sent by Jefferson simply must be read to be understood.  I am very glad I came across this effort, and count it among the most profound U.S. History works I have read.  Ambrose's book is easily as good as his World War II works, and far better than Nothing Like It in the World (his book about the transcontinental railroads' construction).  This was great.	2001-11-22

Readers will hear about his dislike for things Army, especially his training days, and his frequent lucky run-ins with notable media reporters of the day that helped him fine-tune his career as a journalist.  It's not bad; but the stories that show his comapssion such as those where he has been flying with bomber groups only to lose friends, or those where he is at the front and writing about people to send back home to their hometown papers are too rare.<BR>Rooney is honest in his writing, and that is welcome, but we see more of his opinions than we do the better-known war story compendiums now available.

Of all of the things I have read by Ambrose, this book, and the even-more-amazing Citizen Soldiers truly stand out as masterpieces of education- thay make a reader want to know more about some of the most climactic days in the history of the world, and dleivers that infomration at a good clip with alternatively funny, sad, poignant, and inspiring stories all rolling one after another.<BR>I only gave this book 4 stars because I was so blown away by Citizen Soldiers, which picks up where this book left off.

The First World War was obviously, the first world war.  There were a lot of new types of weapons, and new places to etch onto the glass of history, and new names to learn.  This book tries to accomplish the task of explaining the who, why, when, and where, but is overwhelming in its attempt to cover everything.  Obviously, this is not possible to cover every aspect and every unit, but what results is a very comprehensive effort to be used as an authoritative reference source.  I could never imagine assigning this book in class- it would be far too much to process in a short time.

Thanks to the types of missions flown, it will be years before the full story come sout, but until then, read this book.	2001-11-18

The reason this book is different is that it is packed with lots of color pictures that help make the secnes of World War II much more real, and not in the usual age-distorted color more commonly seen.  The accompanying text includes very useful timelines, and then the real treat- letters and documents from both sides of the conlfict, Allied and Axis, personal and official.  This would be a great book to use to have students see, think, and learn about this pivotal time from many different perspectives.	2001-11-18

Discussing the Air National Guard in the 1980s (when the book was written), the book offers a backward glimpse to the days of a larger military confronting the Soviet Union.  Nonetheless, the book does a great job at depcting how the weekend warriors of the sky do their job, and is deservingly respectful to those who defended us in the days of Cold War worries.	2001-11-18

My uncle worked for several years with the submarine fleet in the U.S. Navy, and when pressed by my cousins about what he did, he simply provided them with this book.

We can read all kinds of conversations here- from his domestic problems with civil rights, to his election, to the war in Vietnam. We also can see how tender he was towards his wife, while still having affairs with other women. Michael Beschloss does us all a favor by providing transcripts of the tapes' key moments in the first two years of LBJ's presidency, with background material to explain all of their significance. Vietnam War researchers and U.S. history buffs will need to make this book a guaranteed spot on their shelves. Please note, too, that the auditapes are also available- but not all of the material in the book is found on the tapes.	2001-11-18

The story is crisp, and moves quickly, and has all of the hallmarks that made Clancy's early works so intriguingly fun.

I knew he had been JFK's press secretary, but that was about it.  Pierre Salinger never set out to be a press secretary, serving in World War II, then becoming a journalist along the way.<BR>Salinger's interesting experiences on the Senate investigation of the Teamsters, and his later involvement with the Kennedys is very interesting, as are the anecdotes he provides about the days of the Kennedy administration.  Following those years, he expands again into other ventures, even more surprising, leaving him with a life closer to Forrest Gump than many will ever have.<BR>For information on the inner workings of the JFK campaign and White House, this book is invaluable, but is unfortunately too short.  The book itself is not long, and can be read by a persistent reader in no time.	2001-11-18

There are several color schemes shown, and details on various modifications over the years to allow more detail to come through.  I do wish there had been more on the process of modernizing these ships for the last time under President Reagan, but this does not detract much if one is seeking information on the ships themselves.  If used as a reference on WW2, it will not be entirely useful, but for its technical help, this book is great for modelers.	2001-11-17

However, despite the fact that comparisons cannot be drawn with their rivals overseas in this book does not undermine its effectiveness altogether.  It has quite a lot of photos, in varying times in the boats' careers, from construction to their disposal.  This is a book very helpful for modelers, and for battleship enthusiasts.	2001-11-17

With letters from most American military conflicts, this offers insight into quite a few people in very different areans confronted with a need to connect with those they care about.  In most cases, the fate of each writer is given, and provides further glimpses into the writers' lives.  The exmaple of a 15-year-old who enlisted in WW2, then went to boot camp, and then to combat, is powerful, and not to be missed.

From its meager, uesless beginnings to the oil boom of the 1980s, oil has been the catalyst for a lot more of history than most would think.  Here it is all laid bare.<br />The story of oil and the engine make possible the influx of new and faster wepaons of war in the two world wars, and made its availability a critical strategic goal from then on.  Yergin's account of the huge importnace oil had on the wars and Cold War geopolitics is incredibly obvious in hindsight, but the information here is presented in a clear, insightful manner.<br />I use this book each year to explain to my classes the how and why of 20th century diplomacy and goals.

It can be at times very human, others very number-crunching.  I gave this book to my A.P. US History juniors this summer, and they did not find it as informative as I would have liked.  Still, for a solid account that shows how the 8th, which did not exist prior to Pearl Harbor, was assembled into the mightiest armada of planes in history, this does the job.  Of the few books dedicated solely to the bombing of Europe by the 8th, this stands out due to its number of personal accounts and stories used by Astor to reinforce his points and research.	2001-09-02

Although assigned only about half the book, they never want to sell it used to the incoming seniors, and instead usually claim that part of their sumemr before college will be spent reading what they were not assigned.  What does that tell you?<br />Radzinsky's unprecedented access to the heretofore secret archives of the Soviet Union, Communist Party, and Stalin give him unique insight into a man who tried his best to destroy the evidence of his life, including the here well-documented purges of his friends and allies.  Not only using the archives, but also personal accounts provided by Russians who still remember Stalin, this book does the best job possible to bring this complicated dictator to life.<br />Each page is mesmerizing in its &quot;usual&quot; portrayal, only to be added to or debunked on the next as the &quot;real&quot; story comes out.  This is very well-written, and very entertaining.  It is the best book I have used to explain why Stalin became the heir to Lenin, and then how he stayed in power all those years.	2001-09-02

Known best for his work profiling American presidents, this book focuses on Ike's last years framed by the ongoing, growing military rivalry between the Cold War superpowers. Packed with detail, it is loaded with more information and behind-the-scenes nuggets than I ever kne existed regarding the famous U-2 incident. Knowing some of the people in the program, I certainly learned more about the times discussed and some of the issues involved from the book than from them. The extreme secrecy involved still persists among them today; the book is the best source I have to learn what was happening in those tense days.

Stories are presented in short pieces about individuals and what they experienced, which can be used as separate items or as a good read of a great book. The fact that Brokaw himself read the material is also helpful, since his presentation and tone are very relaxing and interesting to hear. His interest in his topic is sincere and shows, giving this book a great deal of respect for those it wishes to portray.

Witnessing America is divided into several categories detailing different facets of American life. Taken from a wide variety of sources, times, and authors, readers will be able to better understand how Americans evolved as a people in time with their history unfolding around them. I use several of the excerpts conatined in the book for my Advanced Placement level U.S. History class, and they find the choice of selections easy to use and entertaining. Overall, the breadth and depth of this work are best complimented by noting that a followup effort on the rest of the years of U.S. History would be most welcome. As a source to best hear from our ancestors about their lives and what they confronted, I have not seen much like this compliation in several years of looking.

Best of the summer reads	Every reviewer of this book has been rightly unanimous in its praise. Hampton Sides' WWII summer blockbuster of a book is simply the best history work I have read in at least five years, and I read history for a living. Ghost Soldiers combines so many amazing emotional moments, drama, humor, terror, and sadness that it is unique in its presentation. Those who took part in this story in the darkest days of World War II will no longer face the idea that their story will go untold. Sides' book is a gripping read, hard to put down, and stylistically rare in that it is history, yet seems better written than most novelists could only hope for. If you need one book to teach you about the triumph of the human spirit, this is it. If you read only one book this year, this should be it.	2001-08-26

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	5	1	1	N	N	This book started me reading everything Ambrose wrote...	To a person born during the days of Vietnam, living through the end of the Cold War, with a father in the military, I still can't help but wonder how it was that the Citizen Soldiers of World War II did so much so effortlessly. The stories presented in Citizen Soldiers defy the imagination, and can really bring to life the situations that had to be confronted and defeated by the U.S. Army following D-Day in Europe. I have met many veterans of the war, and still I return to Ambrose's offering for more detail and explanation. Every issue of the vast spectacle of war is included, such as the all-important logistical problems faced and conquered by military planners to the desperation fo a Christmas at the front line. It is easy to understand from this book why talking about the war is hard for many; the only problem is that those who saw it are fading away too quickly. Reading this book may ive you an understanding, a very good comprehension of what was faced, but readers would still benefit from finding a veteran themselves, and starting with a grateful &quot;Thank you&quot; for doing what was described here. After this book, I have since gone on to read all of Stephen Amrose's works possible, and am still drawn back to this one at least once a year. This was a great, eye-opening read for a history teacher who thought he had a pretty good idea of what had happened. I gave myself too much credit- this book has given me much more of an idea, and is well worth the time taken to read it.	2001-08-26

Even as the advisor of a high school student organization, I found the suggestions and examples very encouraging at thinking of ways to increase member satisfaction. I used a few suggestions as soon as I could, and I saw our membership increase 20% after implementing the first idea. Any organization would benefit from what is offered here or in Nelson's followup books, such as 1001 Ways to Energize Employees. I have given this book as a gift to others in leadership positions, and have been on the receiving end of some of the concepts since one of the recipients was the principal of my school.

Despite what the Amazon armchair critics would have you believe, this book is really a fantastic effort to document the experiences of what was an elite Army unit in World War II Europe. I read this book only a few weeks before meeting a veteran from Easy Company, Sgt. Amos &quot;Buck&quot; Taylor, and I came away from that meeting confident that Ambrose was, in fact right on the money, and those who argue otherwise need to talk to someone who was there for their comeuppance. Few of us can conceive of, let alone would pass, the training that went into these soldiers before they left the States for England. Described in detail, it gives you that much more appreciation for what the men really did. Taylor's memories echo strongly all I read about Tocoa and Capt. Sobel. When the unit finally deployed in support of D-Day operations, their training gave them an enormous edge. Taylor's own experiences were not unique, but it wasn't long before the whole unit accomplished their goal and waited for the next time they would be needed. A strong theme throughout the book was the bond formed among the men of Easy, which I saw much in evidence that night. Mrs. Taylor also is a part of the reunions, and still marvels at what her husband did. The unfortunate fact is that Buck has never told her a lot of things, and has blocked many out- the book and conversation Buck had with us was the first introduction she had to many of the things her husband saw in war-torn Europe. Ambrose's diligent research is accurate, well-written and truthful. Ignore what those who don't know have to say- I've heard it from one who was there- Band of Brothers is a true story, and hard to put down, much like the men of Easy so long ago.	2001-08-26

However, as in Without Remorse, this one focuses not so much on Jack Ryan, but on supporting actor John Clark. It also shows more of growing favorite Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez. The plot of terrorists being targeted by an elite international anti-terrorist unit is superb, and unfortunately, not a reality. Clark and Chavez work together establishing the organization, and taking it through its initial actions as it reaches its lethal maturity. Clancy does a fantastic job in this novel, and it appears he spent much more time allowing the characters' personalities and shadowy roles to more fully develop than when Jack Ryan is on the scene. Ryan's leading roles have become tiring of late, but the two efforts thus far on Clark and now Chavez leave me re-invigorated and looking forward to the next story. This book was very entertaining, and was not put down for three days except when I absolutlely had to. Well worth the read.	2001-08-25
US	52845843	R2HCE1UR9PSLWI	0671510991	945585365	Diplomacy (Touchstone Book)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	This standard work on 20th Century diplomacy is vital	I use this book every year with my senior-level International Baccalaureate students. They find Dr. Kissinger's analysis sharp, incisive, and at times, very obvious once it is all laid out. At times, it can be a little long, but the coverage and intuitive handling of the chosen episodes for diplomatic action in the 1900s are without equal. I have yet to find anyone else discuss how important Gustav Stresemann was to restoring Germany's pride prior to the reign of Adolf Hitler. The background on the maneuvers prior to World Wars I and II are also very well researched, and his background as a professor and diplomat is clearly obvious. If my students' experiences count for anything, note these items: 1. My students pass their exams, the toughest in the world for high schoolers in history, at nearly a 90% rate every year. 2. When several arrived at their Ivy League schools, this book was required reading (which they still had materials from reading). 3. Of all the people my students discuss, they wish they could meet Henry Kissinger the most to be able to ask him questions. If you want to know why world history developed as it did in the 20th century, this book will show you why.	2001-08-25
