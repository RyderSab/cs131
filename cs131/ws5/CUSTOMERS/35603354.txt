Patrick Gates but it won't be the last.  \\"The Prison\\" is a MUST READ for horror fans!  Not your average ghost stories, these spirits do more than just \\"go bump in the night\\"!  The author provides plenty of visual descriptions that wreak havoc on the imagination.  Several scenes had me cringing as I read them and once or twice I had to put down the book and take a mental break after a particular scene left me thinking, \\"Oh no he didn't!\\"  But he does and he does it well!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend \\"The Prison\\" to anyone looking for a sleepless night or two.  The characters are great, the plot is amazing and \\"Good Old Doc\\"....absolutely depraved!<br /><br />Definitely not for the weak stomached or faint of heart...	2005-02-27

I enjoyed the verbal sparring between Sinclair and Quincy and their blossoming relationship was quite believable.  The antics of the secondary characters made for an enjoyable read, as well.<br /><br />However, I soon tired of Jo's \\"masquerade\\" when it was evident to me only a few chapters in that almost everyone who met her acquaintance saw right through her disguise.<br /><br />A light easy read that most would enjoy.	2005-02-17

I have read every book in the Dark-Hunter series and prior to reading \\"Seize the Night\\", my favorite story was Zarek's in \\"Dance With The Devil\\".  I thought no one could be more tortured than poor Zarek.  Wrong!<br /><br />I was captivated by Valerius almost immediately!  Gone were the black leather pants and the gothic/punk attire replaced by turtlenecks, slacks and style.  Wow!  What a breath of fresh air!  Not saying I mind a hot bod clad in tight leather but...it was a nice change.  *grin<br /><br />This man was sooo sensitive.  Sensitive without being wimpy, mind you.  I just wanted to cuddle him.  And he was such a gentleman, in my opinion.  I was pissed at how he was treated by everyone around him, including his fellow Dark-Hunters.  However, I was very impressed by the fact that Artemis didn't bestow any extra powers on her Roman Dark-Hunters.  That pretty much told me that Valerius was one bad mo-fo to have fought off Daimons for centuries using only his strength and skill.  What a man!<br /><br />What infuriated me, yet managed to touch me was the fact that Valerius never stood up for himself.  He silently took all that was dished out to him without raising his voice or a hand in his own defense.  And when I read about his upbringing at the hands of his cruel father...man, I broke down and cried like a baby.  *sniffle<br /><br />Tabitha was also a very likeable heroine.  In fact, she is my favorite so far.  Very down-to-earth with quite a few eccentricites, she was my kinda gal.<br /><br />Darker than most of the other books in this series, I'd have to say hands-down, this was by far the best!	2005-02-16

This is the first book I've read by Dean Koontz and I'm kicking myself in the behind for overlooking the man for some many years! After this review, I will make it a point to get my hands on a copy of everything the man has ever written.<br /><br />I first mentioned this book to my husband after coming across it in the bookstore early December. Back cover seemed interesting enough but, not being a fan of Koontz, I decided to put it on my \\"wish list\\".  A few days later, my husband handed me the book (God Bless The Man!  *grin)and with the first words (\\"My name is Odd Thomas...\\") - I was hooked!<br /><br />There are no simple words to describe this book - it is a literary masterpiece.  There were times when I forgot that I was reading a book and felt as if I were reading a memoir of sorts (in fact, it is from this view that Odd presents his story to the reader).  You not only get to know each of the different characters Odd encounters in his life (each unique in their own ways) but you begin to care about what happens to these people.  Many times I held my breath, struggling to keep my eyes from leaping to the paragraph below to see what fate awaited a member of Odd's \\"family\\".<br /><br />I've read some pretty good books in '04 but one of my biggest complaints have been that the books start off very well but I find myself rushing through the ending.  I clung to every word in this book, sometimes stopping to savor a particular phrase delivered by the narrator.  And the ending delivered!  Man, the writing is nothing less than awesome!  So simplistic and yet so genius!<br /><br />Hats off to Mr. Dean Koontz for a magnificent job!	2005-01-21

However, I couldn't bring myself to continue reading this!  I'm sorry but the writing was so amateur to me and quite repetitious with phrases such as \\"Miles inclined his head\\", \\"her sunshine smile\\" and the story itself  - my goodness, could the princess be any more weak or pitiful?  The man verbally abuses her and she \\"reacts as though struck\\" (another overused phrase), and hides in her room and he offers a simple apology and she simply accepts it and no more than two pages later, he pisses her off again only for her to readily forgive him.  STOP THE MADNESS!!!  I plodded through the first chapters, despite my better judgement, because I thought this was perhaps a first novel for this author.  Not so!  Suffice it to say, I will hesitate before picking up another book by Patricia Grasso if this is the norm in her writing.  I do plan on finishing the book - at a later date, of course - and if I find at that time that my opinion of this book and its author has changed, I'll not hesitate to state as much.<br /><br />On a positive note:  The cover is absolutely gorgeous!	2004-12-23

However, \\"Sweetwater Seduction\\" is definitely a KEEPER!!!<br /><br />The heroine, spinster schoolteacher Eden Devlin, is smart and spunky and provided a number of laughs.<br /><br />Burke Kerrigan is a gunslinger with a heart of gold. Ruggedly handsome yet boyishly charming, I couldn't help but picture him as Jack Hughman.<br /><br />The chemistry between these two was only slightly overshadowed by the battle of sharp wits that ensued between them throughout the book.<br /><br />Laughs, likeable secondary characters, and a few tugs on the heartstrings (I cried at the end *blush) - I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone!	2004-11-28

It has the classic \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient.  Gabriel was a hero to be adored.  Unlike most \\"wounded\\" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper.  He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!	2004-11-01

The instep cover of the book, featuring the dashingly handsome \\"Dark Prince\\" and Elizabeth seductively posed against the trunk of a tree amidst a forest backdrop is only the prelude to one HOT tale.<br /><br />Elizabeth has been raised in a household of men headed by her father who thinks that women are \\"useless and stupid\\". Eager to escape her dreary existence in her father's household and resigned to the fact that no man would want her due to her freakish height, coltish limbs, and \\"witch's hair\\" - she resigns herself to a life among the sisters of St. Anne's convent.  Unfortunately, her escort of holy friars have also been charged with escorting the bastard son of the king to the convent to do penance for the murder of a nobleman's daughter.  Elizabeth finds herself disturbingly attracted to the notorious prince and finds his mannerisms to be at odds with his dangerous reputation.  Elizabeth's quick wit and sharp tongue kept me greatly amused throughout the story.<br /><br />Now on to our hero.  The \\"Dark Prince\\" can best be summed up in three words: DEE-LISH-US!!!  *three snaps and a neck twist  I simply adored this man.  I haven't read about a hero of his caliber in quite some time.  He had it all - this man was pure sensuality rolled up in one darkly handsome package.  *fanning self frantically<br /><br />The secondary characters, namely Dame Joanna and Brother Adrian, make for a great story as well.<br /><br />If you're looking for laughs, witty dialogue, snappy comebacks, steamy love scenes, lots of action and heartfelt romance - this book has it all!!!<br /><br />Anne Stuart - I salute you!	2004-09-03

I love how only half of the knight's face is shown, leaving the rest to the reader's imagination.  The castle in the background was yet another nice touch.  Now on to the story...<br /><br />I did not find the violence in this story to be one bit offensive.  In fact, it only added to the realism in this tale.  Some authors get right into the story surrounding the hero and heroine, whereas Ms. Canham treats you to much more than that.  Instead of merely stating that the hero engages in battle, you are taken onto the battlefield with him - the descriptions leaving little to the imagination - BREATHTAKINGLY REAL - the descriptions put you in a mind frame of watching a movie rather than reading a book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story of Ciaran Tamberlane, a man who had lost faith in his God and almost in himself and Amaranth de Langois, the hunted bride of an abusive husband.  I fell in love with Ciaran from the moment he was introducd - quiet, yet commanding...the physical description given of him by the author was enough to make me weak in the knees.  Black hair, green eyes, tall and muscular....YUM!!!<br /><br />Amaranth was most certainly courageous in her attempts to escape yet another abusive marriage.<br /><br />The only thing that prevented me from giving this story a five-star rating was that by the time Tamberlane and Amaranth got around to declaring their love for one another...the book was ending. It's like I was so caught up in the story of how he came to be a excommunicated knight and she a woman on the run and then there was Marak, of course...that by the time the two confessed their feelings for one another, I was like, \\"Okay, now their story begins.\\"  But it doesn't.  Don't get me wrong - the love scenes, though few, were wonderful and the attaction between the two was quite obvious from start but I just wanted more!!!  *whine  However, this doesn't disuade me from ordering every title by Marsha Canham from Amazon.com tonight.  *laugh<br /><br />All in all, this was one of THE BEST medieval stories I've read in quite awhile.

Karen Ranney has a talent for transforming a simple romance into an endearing love story.<br /><br />I've read several romances that lay claim to a \\"scarred\\" hero but the extent of the scars may be nothing more than a limp or a single scar running along the side of the hero's face.  I must admit that when I first read the full extent of Alex's scarring - I was shocked to the point of almost not reading the rest of the book.  In my shallowness, I couldn't fathom how the heroine could possibly look past his numerous disfigurements to see the man beneath the \\"monster\\".  That's when I discovered that \\"Tapestry\\" is more than a romance - it is a story about love - pure love.  By the end of the book, I had fallen in love with Alex myself.<br /><br />Why didn't I give it a 5 star rating? I tend to save this rating for books I would read again and again.  Although this was a beautiful story illustrating the power and endurance of love - there were times when it was heartwrenching in its sorrow evoking very strong feelings of grief and loss that I care not visit again any time soon.<br /><br />Romance, laughter, pain and loss - still love abounds in this masterpiece!!!	2004-08-08

On her first appearance, she makes the acquaintance of Lord St. Aubyn, who eagerly wishes to lay claim to the stunning demirep.

I am an avid reader of romances, mainly historical, and having read through such phrases as \\"his throbbing manroot\\" and \\"she opened herself up to him as a flower opens itself to the sun\\" - let's just say I normally scan over the sex scenes or skip them completely.  But not the case with this story!!!  This story holds some serious sexual tension up until the moment that the two finally find themselves in one another's arms and when they did...I wanted to stand up and cheer.  *laugh<br />This story is beautifully written.  It tells the story of Bryony, who is accused of murdering her cheating spouse and sentenced to a life of servitude in the Australian colonies.  She is purchased by Hayden who is in need of a wetnurse for his newborn infant after the child's mother passed away during childbirth.  Bryony grieves for the child that was taken from her before she was sent away...and the one she lost along the way. Hayden is bitter and struggles with feelings of guilt over the loss of his wife. The author portrays the hardships that the people faced living in such a harsh land and you're drawn into the lives of all the characters. This story is simply wonderful!!!

When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I'd finish it.  The first chapter started out interestingly enough but I was unable to get into the story after that.  But having made a promise to myself to finish every book I start, regardless of how horrible it is, I proceeded to read &quot;Keegan's Lady&quot; and Boy!  Am I glad I did!<br />&quot;Keegan's Lady&quot; quickly became an enchanting love story between Ace Keegan, a dark gunslinger bent on revenge after the wrongful death of his stepfather at the hands of Caitlin's father, and Caitlin O'Shannessey, a tortured young woman who, at the abuse she's suffered at the hands of her father, has developed a mistrust and deep fear of all men.<br />Admittedly, I first found myself becoming slightly annoyed at Caitlin's jumpiness around her husband and his brothers and then my annoyance was replaced with sympathy and understanding as pieces of her abusive past were revealed.  Admiring the way he gently dealt with his new bride, I quickly fell in love with Ace - a gunslinger with a heart of gold.  What a hero!<br />I really liked the character of Ace's younger brother, Joseph, and am hoping that there is another book featuring his story.  Being that this is the first book by Catherine Anderson that I've read - I plan on doing some searching for more books pertaining to the Keegan-OShannessey storyline.<br />There are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this book, as well as a few moments that make you hug the book to your chest and take a deep heartfelt sigh.  I really enjoyed reading &quot;Keegan's Lady&quot; and agreed with another reviewer who felt like an epilogue was much needed.  All in all, this is a highly recommended read.	2004-01-12

I've taken in to consideration that this book is supposedly one of her earlier writings.  All in all, the book was a fair read.  The plot was interesting enough but I soon tired of the interaction between Tristan and Bettina.  Granted, a lot of readers were turned off by the whole &quot;rape&quot; thing but having been made an avid reader of historical romances after reading &quot;The Flame and The Flower&quot; and &quot;The Wolf and The Dove&quot; by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, I was able to understand that this was a theme found in quite a few romance books written during this time frame. What did bother me was that, unlike the characters in the novels I mentioned before, most of the interaction between the two main characters in this book consisted mainly of rape and the author didn't seem to take the time to show how the two developed feelings towards one another as time went on.  It was more like...&quot;I'm going to rape you.&quot;  &quot;I hate you.&quot;  &quot;I'm going to rape you&quot;.  &quot;I hate you.&quot;  &quot;I'm going to rape you.&quot;  &quot;I think I may be falling in love with you.&quot;  WHAAAT???<br />The storyline has enough to keep you reading but one reading was enough for me.

Being a Black woman, who is also an avid reader of historical romances, I haven't come across too many authors who are willing to write a romance dealing with this issue. I applaud the author's effort.  The plot revolves around Sabine, a mulatto girl, who is being raised by a shopkeeper and his wife.  She is in love with a local boy who she later finds out is also her brother.  She's abducted by slave traders and ends up over in Cuba, where she is mistreated by her new &quot;owner&quot;.  She is rescued by Michael, who can't understand why the pretty mulatto with the green eyes captivates him so.  One word for the writing...WEAK!!!  I finished reading the book only because I have made a promise to myself to finish a book no matter how awful the story but I struggled to do so.  There was no depth to the characters at all. The writing was just so...corny, to be polite.  I was so disappointed because I felt like this plot had so many possibilities but the author just failed to deliver.  I normally am not so harsh a judge but I feel like I am a fair one and having read hundreds, if not thousands of romances, I feel pretty reasonable in saying this had to be one of the worse books I have ever read.	2003-11-01

I enjoyed the &quot;snippets&quot; of Eloise's letters at the beginning of each chapter and I, like many other readers, thought the &quot;rescue&quot; scene was one of the best.  I also enjoyed the way the children were used...their scenes with Eloise and their father were very natural and  realistic.  However, if anything, I would suggest you read the book for the romantic gesture Sir Phillip made towards Eloise at the ending of the book (hint: letter trail).  I actually clutched the book to my chest and sighed.  *laugh  Maybe I'm just a romantic at heart but I thought it was so sweeeet.  *smile  A fairly enjoyable read.	2003-07-20

I am not a fan of vampire novels and so when a friend recommended this series to me, it was awhile before I ordered the first book in the Anita Blake series.  All I can say now is...WOW!  I AM A FAN FOR LIFE!!!  *laugh  I just ordered books 2 - 4 in the series and will order the rest once those arrive.  This book has everything: horror, romance, laughs...it's all here!  I really enjoyed this book and can't wait for the others to arrive.  If you're not a fan of vampire reads, trust me - after this one, you will be.  And if you are a fan of vampire reads - this one will be a welcome addition to your library.	2003-07-20
US	35603354	R3FAHS108MC9QC	0786015624	787271	Scream Queen	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Can't Wait To See The Movie...	Okay, there is no mention of a movie being made from this book, but in my humble opinion - there should be!  The book itself reads as though you're watching the story unfold on a movie screen.  I enjoyed it.  True, it wasn't scary enough to make me lose a night of sleep (hence the 4 star and not 5 star rating - sick, huh?  *laugh) but I did have to peek over my shoulder from time to time.  *laugh  I have to agree with one reader that the story seemed to just - end - but then I think that was the purpose of the ending...to kind of leave the readers hanging.  Hanging for what?  A sequel?  Who knows?  All in all, this book is definitely worth getting.  A few graphic but not over the top horror scenes and an interesting plot.  Like I said, I'd be the first in line if the story were turned into a movie.  Speaking of movies, if you liked \\"House on Haunted Hill\\", \\"13 Ghosts\\", or \\"Ghost Ship\\" - grab this book because it's pretty much based on the same theme of greed and such.	2003-04-21

When I first read the \\"pre-reviews\\" of this book before it was released, I was very excited.  So excited that I pre-ordered the book.  I read this book in one day and had to force myself to finish it.  The concept behind the book was great - model goes back in time and is mistaken for a mulatto/quadroon at one of the famous Quadroon balls.  Wow!  This should make for an interesting read, right?  Wrong!  For one, the heroine bemoaned living in a society where she and other women were judged based on their outward appearance - and she spends half the book trying to get the other women around her to change their appearances in attempts to attract the men they desire.  And a Black woman bemoaning her big behind?  Give me a break!  As a Black female and avid reader of historical romances, this book was just plain silly!  I am not a stickler for historical accuracies and such and get tired of reviewers who spend so much time criticizing small inaccuracies that they miss the beauty of a well-written story but this book was just unbelieveable!  For one...the characters sounded like they were from modern days, not historical times.  Secondly, the 4-year old (E.T.  *eyes rolling) - he wasn't funny.  He needed his behind paddled and his mouth washed out with soap.  I could go on and on but why bother?  What could have been a perfectly good story is ruined by an excessive amount of silliness.	2003-04-21
US	35603354	R2D0ASWK721X3Y	0440223717	729437780	The Lover's Charm	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Finally!	Being a Black female and a huge fan of romance books, I rarely find Regency/Midevel romances dealing with Black characters.  In fact, when one reads most romance books dealing with these time periods, it's as if Blacks were non-existent.  Finally a book where there are several Black characters and they are portrayed beautifully!  At first I was leery of how Camille (Jack's mulatto mistress) would be portrayed but I was more than happy to see that the relationship between the two was not cheapened and that Jack truly cared for her.  The romance that blooms between Esme and Mr. Shropsley...well, I won't get into all of that but I will say I was happy with this book and would love to see more novels featuring a variety of ethnic characters.  The story itself was wonderful.  I loved Priscilla's character.  She was truy a wonderful, charming, very likable woman.  I disagree with another reader concerning that little escapade that Jack has with Vivienne.  Jack was under a spell and this just went to show how powerful the magic was that held him.  I think it read very well.  I highly recommend this book!	2003-04-09

I immediately ordered Volume 1 after reading the first four stories in this collection.  The stories were great and gave me the chills I look for when reading books of this nature.  A few of my favorites include:<br /><br />  - \\"Eaters\\"<br />  - \\"Vacation\\"<br />  - \\"Mr. God\\"<br />  - \\"Drive-in Date\\"<br />  - \\"Easy's Last Stand\\"<br />....Oh, who am I kidding?  I loved them all!!!  Pick this one up!!!	2003-04-03

This book was better than the last but in my opinion, it didn't live up to what I normally expect from the &quot;Hot Blood&quot; series.  The collection of short stories managed to keep my attention but failed to keep me up at night.  *laugh	2003-04-03

I bought this book after reading quite a few reviews on it and although it wasn't quite what I expected (I thought his charade as the &quot;master castle-builder&quot; would have been carried out a bit longer) - it was a pretty good story.  There were several scenes that made me laugh and one or two that brought tears to my eyes.  It made for a very believeable story and I really liked how well the secondary characters were portrayed.  I wouldn't say the story was boring in the least and it would make a good read for many a romance lover.	2003-03-26

In fact, I can't help but grin when I recall Katherine's encounter with the \\"highwayman\\".  All in all, I thought this book took a different approach than most in that you started out almost disliking the heroine from page one.  But as the story progresses you begin to understand her more and more.  Katherine won my vote by not being your typical \\"damsel in distress\\" waiting to be rescued by her Prince Charming.  And Alain...he was adorable.  I mean, he was just real to me.  Sure, he wasn't exactly \\"titled\\" and his \\"nonchalant\\" attitude towards life might have proven a bit frustrating to some but to me...it made him all the more believeable.  All in all, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance!!!	2003-03-06

For one, I was so tired of reading about how the \\"hero\\" was tortured over something that, in my opinion, he had nothing to really do with.  I wanted to pull out my hair and scream, \\"Get Over It Already!!!\\"  I had struggle to read the last few pages...in fact, I'm not sure I did read the last few pages.  The story started out okay but quickly went downhill.	2003-03-06

My favorites being University and The Mailman.  I even liked his collection of short stories ('The Collection').  This book, in my opinion, just wasn't that good or interesting to me.  Sorry.	2003-03-06
