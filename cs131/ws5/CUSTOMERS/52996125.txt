US	52996125	R1S2WWGQDA84GZ	0425204200	370413722	Trace (Scarpetta)	Books	1	5	5	N	N	Whatever happened to the real Kay Scarpetta?	This is a slow paced addition to Kay Scarpetta's adventures.  Once there was fire, personality, humanity in the amazing woman doctor/lawyer medical examiner, but now she is mundane.  Scarpetta is called to Richmond to consult on a case, a simple case that the good Dr. Fielding, her well trained associate from the early books, would never have misdiagnosed. Yet The PD called in the FBI to look into the case of a 14 year old girl  whose death had been ruled natural.<br /><br />Scarpetta takes the consultation job because Benton Wesley, her once dead, but now alive, lover won't take her on vacation to Aspen since a case came up that he has to work on.  I continued to wonder why he was involved at all, and even after finishing the book, see no purpose in the Aspen sessions.  Yes, the cases are connected, but so what -- no one wants to talk about their own case and there is a great lack of communication.<br /><br />The lack of communication is explored lightly in a training session that Rudy leads for new recruits -- who basically fail their first camp exercise due to it.  This is one of the most interesting scenes, but it is short.  Scarpetta, Lucy, Benton are all aware that keeping information secret from one another can be disasterous -- but that doesn't affect what they are doing.<br /><br />Lucy is an interesting character: volatile, deadly, always has poor judgement in her relationships which then jeopardizes her career and the lives of others.  Rudy is a strong, enigmatic, underdeveloped character who deserves some sort of a life while he is in these stories. It might be time for Patricia Cornwell to segue these two into their own series TLP (The Last Precinct) and let them grow since she is obviously bored with Scarpetta.<br /><br />Marino is not quite as fat and sloppy as in earlier books, but if you haven't followed him then you won't find interesting character transitions here.<br /><br />The plot plods with bits and pieces of scenes that have no connectivity.  Fairly early in the story you learn who the culprit is.  The reasons for his killing are revealed slowly, and not by confrontation, but by \\"telling\\" through flashbacks. Good writers know that telling rather than showing takes away the suspense and thrill.<br /><br />Ultimately the book ends. The killer is caught. Kay and Benton are reunited. And these three sentences equal the wrap-up. It is that lacking in power, surprise, energy.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book. It is the last Scarpetta novel for me.connectivity.

Townsend, and through quirks of fate, she faces the monster 12 years later in court.  The statute of limitations on her rape has passed, but she knows that he is vicious and she has the legal expertise to put him away for another crime, and he might well have done it -- the evidence certainly points to him. That is a compelling story in itself, but the book is so much deeper.<br /><br />Is he guilty of the crime for which she is prosecuting? Should she recuse herself or can she be fair? Could anyone be fair?<br /><br />The courtroom drama is brilliant and there is no getting lost in various legal issues.  It is not filled with  unnecessary details and jargon.<br /><br />Her scenes are so vivid that I feel as if I have first hand information about what a rape victim goes through in trying to both remember and forget at the same time. That information has given me insight into others.<br /><br />This is fast paced and intriguing.  It is a first class read.	2005-04-04

How did Deirdre disappear and where did she go?  I finally got my answer.<br /><br />The Cadre has taken most of the vampire holdings, but Vivienne managed to secrete a large amount of funds.  She is able to purchase tickets and we see Vampires on the airlines, and that is intriguing; all flights must begin and end in the night.  Where and how does a hungry vampire feed while on a flight?<br /><br />Favorite characters such as Deirdre, Vivienne, Sam, Mitch, Max, and Victor come into focus with the revelations of their lives and emotions.  There are some definite surprises: one of the main characters dies while old favorites come back into the game.<br /><br />Taylor's writing makes it is easy to visualize the changing scenery from the small village in France, to England, New York, New Orleans, and Maine.  Characters change dramatically, and now I wonder \\"what's next?\\"<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next Deirdre and Mitch Griffin experience.<br /><br />If you have never read a Karen Taylor vampire book, then pick up both the prequel and this delightful sequel -- you will probably find yourself \\"hungering\\" for more.

Set in the year 2022, this high tech thriller creates innovative architecture, a Traffic Management Centre (TMC), subterranean parking structures, and a whole lot of problems for Brussels, Belgium, in which the roadways have been set up like the spokes of a wagon wheel.<br /><br />Everything runs smoothly with the TMC keeping track of any minor emergency on the Metro, parking structures, or highway.  TMC can easily re-route vehicles to other less congested travel patterns.  However, there are sixteen entry points to the center of the city, and when terrorists block them, the roadway is literally a parking lot.  Very few people can get to work, but fortunately, our hero Hugh Ryan, a Transport Authority Controller, always arrives a little before 7:00 AM, so he is on the job when the problems begin.<br /><br />There are multiple villains with the access to shut down the city or blow up buildings, and they do both.  Each is revealed, but not until the end do all of the pieces fall into place.<br /><br />This is one of the most creative situations I have run across in a thriller, and all too familiar because of the traffic jams.  I know just how irritated and anxious people are when stuck in traffic, and because I know, this book brought my own emotions into the story.<br /><br />From Prologue to ending, this is an excellent read.	2005-01-04

My opinions may reveal details and events that await your own journey through this book.<br /><br />.<br /><br />The slow start of this novel picked up about mid-way through.  From there it was a page-turner filled with surprises that equal those of powerhouse writers: Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, Clive Cussler, Stephen King, et al.<br /><br />One of the aspects that I enjoyed was the build up for the war at Armageddon.  I often wondered how so many people would gather on the planes for this battle, and who they would be.  These novels provided insight for me that made a lot of sense.<br /><br />As prophesied in the Book of Revelations, many will die during the End Times, and the ones they love will mourn them.  However, in a novel, particularly a series, it is imprudent to destroy all of the protagonists before the series ends.  Imagine Lord of the Rings without Frodo Baggins, or Star Wars (4-6) without Luke Skywalker and Han Solo?  Where would the entire series be without Darth Vader?  Removing the main characters, in my opinion, is very poor writing that can bring about the loss of readers.<br /><br />Even though these are Christian novels about the end of the world, they character driven.  Through eleven books, I have grown to know and care about these characters as people not simply protagonists, etc., on pages in books, what is the hook to keep me reading now?<br /><br />Although from Book One (Left Behind) forward, we knew that the death of the Tribulation Forces could happen, I did not think the main characters would cease to exist before the series concluded. These deaths ended the chronicles for me.  I thought I would wait in avid anticipation for book twelve, but that is not the case.  This book should have been it.<br /><br />Another problem is viewing the deaths of the four through a narrator's eyes.  A basic principle of good writing is to show not tell.  I would rather experience at least one of the main characters making it through to the Glorious Appearing and be able to show his emotions at each death, and the mighty coming of God's Armies.  This would make me want to read the next book.<br /><br />Many characters dominated the latter books of this series, but the strength of their continuity required their connections to the main characters.  However, there were too many individuals to whom to build any emotional connections.  Right now, I can tell you who died, but not who lived to see the end.  I do not care.<br /><br />Book Twelve must drift more into the author's own speculations than scriptures.  John the Revelator and other Biblical prophets told us that the Armies of God descend from the clouds in heaven and save Jerusalem. Satan will be bound for 1000 years, and then given freedom for a short time among men.  This is, I assume, the ultimate plot of book twelve.<br /><br />Since I am a believer, this series does not stretch credibility for me.  Many coincidences fill the books, but many philosophers do not believe in coincidence, and I agree with them, thus I can easily accept the connections between all of these individuals and events.  Therefore, even though I found this book to be of a lesser quality than the previous books, it is still worth three stars to me.<br /><br />Victoria TarraniI would rather experience at least one of the main characters making it through to the Glorious Appearing and be able to show his emotions at each death, and the mighty coming of God's Armies.

Now everyone must take the mark of the beast, (frequently referred to as 666).  People must bow to and worship the statues that belch black sooty smoke and receive a mark on either their forehead or their hand, as prophesized in the Book of Revelations.  They must also have a computer chip injected and embedded as part of this process.  No is not an option -- it means a trip to the guillotine.  It is a personal decision, and it is forever.  Many believers are slaughtered, but those who stay true discover that God has also marked His people with a cross on their forehead, but it is visible only to other believers.<br /><br />The only way a person could stand against imminent torture and death was through the power of the Holy Spirit that God has also given to His believers when they turn to him.  Many thought they could resist, but it was only through the power of the Holy Spirit that they were able to walk to the guillotine, bend, place their neck into the slot, and hear the swish of the blade just before it ended their lives.  This was both humbling and exciting.<br /><br />This is the time when end time main characters emerge.  One story is especially poignant, and it is that of a young, brilliant Chinese Christian man who is forced by his father to take the mark.  He has been drugged so that he does not fight when this is done to him.  He also bears the cross of God, but it is seen only by other believers.  This allows him extraordinary access when he is placed under the wing of the current computer genius, also a Christian.<br /><br />Each book as you get closer to the end is more engrossing, exciting, and action driven.  It is difficult to develop depth in all of the new characters, but LeHaye and Jenkins do a credible job.  Vignettes about conversions and rescues show that Chloe, Rayford, Buck, Tsion Ben-Judah, Chaim Rosenberg, and others maintain a strong presence, and there is excellent foreshadowing for the future of the Tribulation Force.<br /><br />Of course, after reading eight of these novels, I will read the next one.  I have a feeling of trepidation because I am closer to the end of the series than the beginning.  Still captivated by the non-stop action, but weak character and vignette plot development, I will give it five stars.<br /><br />Victoria Tarranice, and there is excellent foreshadowing for the future of the Tribulation Force. <br /> <br />Of course, after reading eight of these novels, I will read the next one.

I wish I had some of the technological devices that the Tribulation Force did.  The techie in me loved the descriptions and wanted more.  These tools allowed Chloe to manage her international conglomerate of Christian traders without slowing.  Now, some of the shippers who supported the trading cause have been caught and killed.  This is a time when only those with the mark of Carpathia can buy, sell, get medical aid, or go out without expecting to be captured.<br /><br />This book is powerfully visual, but I would still like to know more about Petra, and if it does fit the Biblical place of refuge.  It probably does since LaHaye and Jenkins have obviously done extensive Biblical research to put the series together.  More descriptions, I think, would be helpful.<br /><br />Millions of Judeo-Christians are living in this arid place where there is no source of water or food.  However, just as God provided for the Israelites as they spent forty years wandering the deserts in the Old Testament, God provides manna and a continuous fountain.  If it seems that the authors have used a deus ex machine process for the miracles, remember this is a series about God protecting his own and showing His miraculous intervention.<br /><br />Carpathia sees millions of people in Petra, so he must try to destroy the city.  A target so ready that how can he resist?  But, just as he was unable to kill the two prophets in the streets of Jerusalem until their time was fulfilled, he is stopped by God's power.  Frustrated, the antichrist's forces work to lure the undecided who reside in Petra into their fold.<br /><br />More characters become primary, and I found many of them unique and fascinating.  Intrigue and action are still the driving force for this book as Christians try to save other believers and those who have not yet taken the mark, which was required in book eight of the series.  With millions of people still on earth, Carpathia's forces have not been able to compel everyone to receive the mark or die.  It is still gory, and there are a lot of believers who are captured and killed.  The antichrist's soldiers were hampered by the boils and sores, and perhaps this was God's way of giving aid to His remnant.<br /><br />Hurry I need the next book.  As I have stated previously, I am a captive audience; therefore, it is five stars for me.  That is just my opinion.<br /><br />Victoria Tarraniich was required in book eight of the series.

He has now raised himself from the dead and called forth his dead prophet to life; many false prophets have arisen and performed acts of sorcery in his name.  It is, however, when the antichrist goes into the temple and proclaims that he is God that brings forth the wrath of God.<br /><br />This proclamation causes an uprising in the Jewish community and blood baths in streets all around the world.  Many Carpathian believers, who had not yet taken the mark, begin a journey to discover who will own their souls.  However, the Carpathians are targets as the plagues begin.  God protects his own which are those who have not taken the mark of the beast and bear the believer's cross.<br /><br />This is where Chang Wong, the young Chinese man who was drugged by his father and given the mark, flirts with suicide.  He is the only one who has both marks, and it is a fascinating concept.  Since he did not choose the mark of the beast, God keeps him protected with the cross of the believers.  His passage through his crisis is powerful.<br /><br />Water turns to blood.  This was fascinating when cases of bottled water became blood, but not in the hands of those who believed.  Demonic creatures attack everyone with the mark of the antichrist that causes boil like sores.  What did Carpathia do during this time? He hid out in a completely self-contained building so that he would not be attacked.  When the moon turns to blood and 1/3 of the sun is darkened, he can do nothing for those who accepted him as God.  He can do nothing period except require that his loyal army seek and destroy any who do not have the mark.  This is rather humorous since most of them cannot move without severe pain and pustules that break open.<br /><br />Do not start with this book.  If the series interests you, then you must start with Left Behind, otherwise no one will matter and the continuity is gone.<br /><br />Each book seems richer than the last to me.

Who kills him? It is an excellent question with wonderful foreshadowing as tension builds.  John the Revelator's Prophecy states that the Antichrist will be killed by a sword, so LeHaye and Jenkins added a gun named the Sword.  Will it be the bullet or blade?<br /><br />In death, Nicolae Carpathia is displayed in a crystal coffin for the predicted three days.  Over four million people make the journey to New Babylon to cry over their beloved leader and millions more watch the non-stop television presentation.  Beside this man is a twenty-four foot bronze statue that belches black smoke and demands submission and commitment from everyone.  Replicas will be in all major cities, and if one does not bow to the graven image, it means death.<br /><br />When Carpathia comes back to life on the third day, he breaks out of the crystal coffin, there is but one thought -- he is god.  This is the Indwelling when Satan takes full control of the man.  Whereas Nicolae kept his satanic prayers in private and did not blatantly destroy those who opposed him, now the beast is ready to acquire as many souls as possible in the time left.  The stature given by his faithful is enhanced when he calls forth his own dead prophet.<br /><br />Each member of the Tribulation Force faces personal dilemmas and seeks to find others whose faith is not in Carpathia.  Safe houses are blown, new places and new characters are added and do add to the depth of the force as well as add foreshadowing.  It is pure action and seems to have a solid background in Biblical knowledge, especially in the accounts of God's judgments.<br /><br />You cannot start reading this series by starting in the middle.  Each book builds upon the previous one, and if you have read this far into the series, you will not stop. I made sure I had the next one when I read so that I felt the continued pressure and involvement.<br /><br />There are many who will not like any of the reviews of this or the other eleven books because they do not like the series or the ideas presented.

To get the gist of The Last Precinct, one must read Black Notice -- quite probably, Point of Origin is also required.<br /><br />Whereas Black Notice was a complete and satisfactory novel within itself, even though I had not read Point of Origin, this book falls short of Cornwell's immense talent.  There is sufficient dialogue that the effusive use of descriptions and time lapses are somewhat explainable, the continuous narrative quality, however, turns this into a tell story rather than a show story -- a fatal flaw in manuscripts by new authors.  Those with a reputation get away with it, but the fan club dwindles.  When I finished reading Black Notice, I wondered why I stopped reading Cornwell, now I remember.<br /><br />This does follow through regarding the Chandonne crime family based in France, but the involvement of Interpol, ATF, FBI, CIA, Virginia and New York medical examiners, law enforcement, and District Attorneys, and though I can not recall specifically, maybe the NSA, and it censures the plausibility of the story.  Is ATF Lucy's shoot out in Miami connected?  What does this have to do with crimes in New York, which occurred prior to the Virginia events?  Three men are murdered and disfigured -- why?  Why is the New York DA in charge of a Virginia case?  Who killed the young boy and why?  That does, at least, have an answer.  However, most of the questions do not.<br /><br />Characters that have been apparently way in the background of her earlier novels suddenly appear in this one -- the main one being Marino's son.  Most likely, he was discussed in earlier books, but I do not recall.  He seemed to be a pro bono addition to make the story more interesting and give Marino a bigger part.  If Cornwell had simply completed the novel rather than open it for a sequel, then I never would have missed many of the characters.<br /><br />If you have read Point of Origin and Black Notice, then you will want to read this.  This book was published in 2000, since that time there has been a Kay Scarpetta cookbook.  Kay Scarpetta, for those who do not know, has been the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Virginia since the series began, and she is an Italian Chef with an unlimited supply of time and food when the mood suits her.

For some reason, I stopped reading Cornwell novels several years ago. After &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I want to go back and catch up on the ones I have missed, and even the ones I have read before! Yes, it is that good.<br /><br /> Kay Scarpetta grows and develops as Cornwell moves forward in her series about the Doctor-Lawyer-Chief Medical Officer. Based in Richmond, VA, Scarpetta lives in a niche port -- one that is not international and rarely has its cargo opened and checked. However, the stench of death and decay in an off-loaded container drags Kay to murder most vicious.<br /><br /> Covering the corpse is the residue of downy fine human hair; it was in his clothes and clung to the body as it traveled across the Atlantic Ocean. Scratched on one of the boxes is a clue about a werewolf. The first issue is to find the identity of John Doe, and since the ship was foreign and the clue written in French, this leads to Interpol.<br /><br /> Interpol requests Scarpetta and her detective partner Pete Marino to fly to France. It is significant that their flight is on the Concord, and that they stay in one of the most expensive hotels in Paris.<br /><br /> Cornwell is masterful in her use of words. The character?s dialogues fit their education; I once had a teacher who called words not in every day usage &quot;ten dollar college words.&quot; That Kay Scarpetta is both an attorney and a doctor makes her extensive vocabulary help a reader suspend disbelief.<br /><br /> Cornwell?s writing is rich with details and descriptions, and I wish I could read this book for the first time. The story is complete, and it is not until I started &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; that I realized it needed a sequel.<br /><br /> This is an excellent suspense thriller with a great mystery.

Add another 1/2 star to the three I've given it.<br />It is difficult to visualize the various plagues in the Book of Revelations, however Lahaye and Jenkins have done an excellent job.  Why these demon locusts did not attack everyone was very clear.  Also I've wondered about the two prophets who will be left in the streets of Jerusalem for three days as John describes, but again the authors brought these two men to life for me.<br />Amanda Steele may have been a traitor to her husband and The Tribulation Force.  Since I had no emotional connection to Amanda, who was introduced merely to play a small role, I was unconcerned that she disappeared.  However, her death along with others on the jet that crashed did show Nicolae Carpathia's truer motive.<br />In my opinion, this is one of the better books in the Left Behind series, but after reading four straight through I was committed to the series.  If someone were to start reading just one book out of order, then I think the interwoven connections would be difficult to follow.<br />The scenes in Jerusalem were strong and well written.  Never having been to the city, I was able to picture it somewhat -- especially considering the photojournalists and newscasters we have today.  New characters are introduced as each book moves forward, which keeps the pressure building with their interpersonal relationships and questions of fealty.<br />True dramatic tension is missing, but the humor at the expense of the The AntiChrist and his divergent crew is refreshing, though difficult to imagine.  However, if you have read the previous four books, this will be an excellent adventure in the continuing saga.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-21

I gave up cooking in 1985, but this cookbook in combination with the grill brought me back into the kitchen.  Not really for the joy of cooking, but because the flavors are exceptional, the aroma lingers in the house, and the ideas are endless.<br />Nearly every item that you might consider grilling is included in the cooking times section.  My first venture included sweet potatoes cut into 1/2 inch slices and placed on the grill... I added different spices than the recipes in the book, but I would never have thought of grilling vegetables without the book.  They were good, very good.<br />Having succeeded with veggies, I took a package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs and coated them with cream of chicken soup.  Crisp on the outside, tender where it matters.<br />Neither of these recipes are in the book, but I find the real value of a cook book is that it stimulates your imagination.  It's great knowing exactly how many carbs, calories, and the fat content are.<br />My book came with the grill.  If it had not been included, I'd have purchased the book anyway.  This book adds zest to your meals.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-21

What if you did have the power to stop a killer before he killed everyone you knew and loved? That is the question the plagues several main characters who are each determined to be the Assassin as prophesized in The Book of Revelations.  This assassination is key to the transition for Nicolae Carpathia to fulfill the next step in his final days.  Without this event he cannot claim to be God and raise himself from the dead.<br />Rayford Steele wants to destroy the man who killed his wife Amanda.  Buck Williams wants to reveal Nicolae as the AntiChrist through his cyberspace magazine.  Tsion is determined to preach in Jerusalem, though it is more dangerous for him to do so than for any other man.  Hattie Durham, the former airline stewardess and Carpathia's mistress, wants to vanquish the man who impregnated and then abandoned her. And those who were under the mind control of the AntiChrist, but have been freed, have their own special vengeance to deliver.<br />So, the question is: The assassination begins the second half of the seven year tribulation, and it must be done, but when the motive is based in hatred, how can it be God's work?  That's the conundrum I see.<br />LaHaye and Jenkins address this question several times, but do not have an answer either.  However, they seem to be riding the crest of their own writing and it has become stronger.  Cliffhangers actually hang, surprises are just that, and the killer is unexpected.  The question of right or wrong is a personal one.<br />This is another adventure in the ride through the end-times.  It is fiction, there is a great deal of doctrine liberally doled out, and it is based on the last book of the Bible.  This one has good cliff hanging escapades throughout.<br />I'm sure one of the reasons that I like this series is that the philosophy parallels my own.  But such are all reviews - simply personal opinions.  I've read six, and I'll read six more.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-21

I assume it was to fulfill a lifelong goal for mother and daughter to write together or for a contract because that is all that was achieved.  I've never read Carol Higgins Clark, therefore I do not know if her other books were as boring.  Mary Higgins Clark, however, has kept me spellbound for hours.<br />The plot was mediocre -- Luke Reilly and Rosita Gonzazles are kidnapped for ransom. They are held in a leaky boat until the inept culprits get paid.  The stupidity of these criminals comes through in their conversation and actions.  The characters were one-dimensional and gratuitous, and it seemed their only purpose was to give names for identification while reading.<br />I was surprised by the immature style of writing.  Even though we run into people with our name, it is not a good story approach because it can be confusing - two sets of Reilly's make for difficult character identification.  Long time writers rarely make the mistake of switching the point of view (POV) multiple times within short segments or changing the verb tense from past to present while doing so.  Perhaps I see this clearly because I'm an editor, but I think the sudden switches would be unwelcome by most readers.  The book needed to be proofread, and may have been, but there were so many grammatical errors that I doubt if the authors even read it.  Some of these items are question marks or periods immediately followed by a comma, or double period marks, and some misspellings.  Every book has some proofread errors, and I, like most people, simply ignore them.  There were too many to be ignored.<br />In my opinion, this book was published because of the author's names. Period. I do not recommend it.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-20

She is the image of the nude woman either sleeping or dead, but she did not pose for the painting.  Thus begins Jordan's journey to find out if the painting is her sister Jane Lacour, her twin who is missing and presumed dead.<br />There is a luscious cast of characters, both suspects and investigators.  The plot is well developed, and all too plausible since many women do disappear from their lives.  Most do not run away from the two children and a good husband they adore.  Jane certainly didn't leave them intentionally.<br />I enjoyed Iles contemplation of the connections between identical twins.  Even with Jordan's memory about the moment she felt her sister's death, she never gave up hope that Jane would be found alive.  Perhaps the sensations she thought were Jane's death weren't.  After learning what happened to Jane, I wondered if Jane had felt similar sensations about Jordan - that is how \\"real\\" these characters were.<br />This book is outstanding; it is a page-turner in the truest sense of the words.  I came to some of the same conclusions as Jordan did, but in the end only her creativity and depth of knowledge could save her life.<br />Five stars!<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-20

Open the book and get ready for a shocking, tumultuous, futuristic trip.  2045 is bleak indeed, especially if you happen to be a Christian.<br />Wintermas, previously Christmas, was a time for celebration and gifts.  However, it was also a time when those who were Christians, forbidden as all religions were, had a more difficult time masking their identities.<br />In my opinion, the world geopolitical situation was implausible, and there was insufficient background to set the stage that took away the rights of those who chose whether they believed and worshipped or not.  Being caught with a Bible meant death.<br />Thus enters the zealot Paul Stepola, an agent in the National Peace Organization.  The NPO was created to destroy religion wherever it was found.<br />Paul is very good at his job -- he finds Christians, and they are executed in dramatic and revolting ways.  He determines that he will have more ammunition if he studies the Bible, and is provided with both books and CDs for his study.  He is changed by the scripture study, and his journey to Christianity parallels the Biblical Apostle Paul's.  I'm sure Stepola was named for him, which is only one of the contrivances used in this book.<br />This is, however, a fast paced thriller, but I was aware that it was \\"just a novel.\\"  Taking into account that I purchased this book thinking it was #12 in the Left Behind series, and I was disappointed, I raise the stars from two to three.  I'm sure this is book one of a series, and I have no plans to read others.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-20

However, this book was not plausible, as most of his works are.  After Dead Sleep, I'm sure Iles was drawn to the topic of multiplicity within one person - what if it were possible that the will to live could keep the spirit alive forever?  Living forever is an underlying thought in The Footprints of God, the book that immediately follows this one in his writing career.  I've reviewed both.<br />Eve Sumner is exotic, and she draws John Waters into an erotic journey that takes him into his own past.  John is haunted by Eve's similarity to Mallory Candler.  It shows in Eve's speech, the way she walks, her self-inflicted scars, and her intimate knowledge of John and Mallory's passionate romance during their college years.  Eve is Mallory, but Mallory is dead.<br />John goes quickly from disbelieving Eve and Mallory are one, to a man possessed by the immortal Mallory.  Mallory had tried to kill John when she was alive, now she is back - but it isn't his death she wants, he is the object of her obsession.  John's marriage is in trouble, and it was the lack of intimacy that made him vulnerable to Eve's sexy machinations.  Now he is trapped, and Mallory is a killer who will go from body to body to get what she wants.<br />In my opinion, soul transference is a delightfully thought reviving subject.  It can evoke provocative philosophical discussions.  I enjoyed reading this book, but wouldn't do so again or go to a theater to see an adaptation of it.<br />Far superior books are Dead Sleep and 24 Hours, and I hope Iles returns to plausible plots.  His characters, as always, are rich and deep, and he weaves the story well with them.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-20

Having written the stunning article \\"The Wrath of the Lamb\\" in the previous book, Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia suspects that Buck Williams is a Christian.  Buck searches for Chloe while Rayford Steel tries to locate his new bride Amanda.  Lahaye and Jenkins show the emotional chaos and worldwide destruction through excellent descriptions.<br />This book begins during the 21st month (halfway through) Nicolae Carpathia's reign.  We see the fulfillment of more prophecies as we travel to Iraq, Israel, America, and other world communities.  Life is now comprised of living in underground shelters, evangelism through direct contact and web sites, finding enough to eat, clean water to drink, and other Christians with whom to work.<br />As prophesized, Nicolae knows that his time to rule the world is half-over.  His hunger to devour the souls of those still on earth is his driving force.  The general populace still sees him as a benevolent ruler, but we see behind the scenes where murder and anger rule the man-the Antichrist.<br />Lahaye and Jenkins show more character development than in previous books and the action is fast paced and demanding.  Some familiar characters are dead, but new ones take prominence in The Tribulation Force.<br />By this point in the series, I was completely hooked.  I had a hard time putting the book down, especially since I knew I had seven more on the bookshelf.  As soon as I finished this book, I grabbed the next one.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-10

They study, and Rayford works to convince his daughter Chloe that she also must give her heart and life to Jesus Christ and ask for salvation.  These three are the center of the Tribulation Force, but romance leads Buck Williams to this group.<br />The Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia, brings both men together as his employees through Hattie Durham, who becomes Nicolae's companion.  It is a world where Christians should keep their faith secret, but Rayford continues to share his religion with those he works with.  It becomes dangerous when he becomes the Global Force One pilot for Nicolae.  Buck, in favor of Nicolae, writes his world famous column, but that commitment changes.<br />The writing is not strong, but the story continues at a good pace.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2004-06-10

The Tribulation Force now knows that Nicolae Carpathia is the Antichrist described in John's Book of Revelations, the final book in the New Testament.  It is obvious to readers from the beginning that he is, but the scenes in which he takes control of worldwide leadership are shocking.<br />The Book of Revelations reveals seven seals that are the prelude to the last seven years of the End Times.  Buck Williams, still able to maintain his lucrative position as headline writer, publishes a stunning article entitled \\"The Wrath of the Lamb\\" just before the worldwide earthquake (seal number six) flattens mountains, opens or closes streams, brooks, and lakes, and reduces the size of land mass by enveloping great sections in the churning chaos of the sea.  This is prophesized by John the Revelator.  These descriptions, I thought, were well written.<br />One of the main aspects of Nicolae's power is owning the media.  Current laws do not allow one conglomerate to own controlling interests in radio, television, newspapers, magazines, or production companies.  The Antichrist brings a large populace into his fold with promises and mind control.  However, he owns it all.  He combines all religions into one Global Religion under his appointed Supreme Pontiff, and takes on the tile of Grand Potentate of the Global Community.<br />While I was reading this book, there were recent political and communication changes in the United States that may allow a single entity to own more media control.  These current changes made me wonder if a path is in the works for a single man to govern the world.<br />Again, the characters are underdeveloped.  Rayford Steel marries a woman just introduced in this book while Chloe and Buck finally tie the knot.  The Tribulation Force is still trying to draw Hattie Durham into their fold.<br />This is a fast action paced novel.  Of course, I was committed to reading the series by this time,  so I may not be the best judge.

Some understand what happened when the night sky, for a few moments, was brighter than noon in the Sahara Desert; some do not; many people have no clue.<br />Rayford Steel, pilot, planned to have his first extramarital affair with his flight attendant Hattie Durham.  However, half the passengers and some of his flight crew disappear, leaving their clothing and belongings behind, and he knows what happened. His wife and son are gone, and he feels guilty and afraid.  Newscasts televise the plethora of accidents and crashes that occur because the drivers suddenly disappeared.  The world is in chaos.<br />One of the passengers on the plane is Buck Williams, who also plays a key role in developing a Tribulation Force to stand against the anti-Christ.  Buck is a feature writer for a magazine and has access that many do not, including to the man who rises from the ashes as the most powerful man on earth.<br />Why was it the best selling Christian fiction and New York Times' number one for so long?<br />The writing is not strong but, like others, I was engrossed in the story and possible answers.

The caught a ghoul, the Ducheski's own group of demented servants who are allowed to kill, and to do whatever it takes to protect the Ducheski clan.  Ghouls regenerate, and this leads to a climactic decision where Blake and Malcolm are concerned.<br />Did you know there are political levels in the vampire world, and woe unto the vampire that does not stay within the confines?  Or, that it is a \\"mortal\\" sin for a vampire to kill another without permission?  Oh, these factors come into play in magnificent ways.<br />In the meantime, Victoria takes Regina to France, where a strange world of the undead reveals that Emma Blake is a tool of the blood sorcerers.  Here Regina meets the mad priest Anatole, and sees that both Victoria and Anatole are more interested in making Regina belong to them than in any way freeing her mother.  Their escape from Anatole is difficult, and it is here that Regina faces Malcolm for the first time since her initiation.<br />Boulle's characters grow and evolve.  I wondered what decision Regina would make, considered options, and was concerned for them as I read the book.

The book is filled with mystical mysteries, and has been thoroughly researched so that the anachronistic details take you to Victorian England.  I could not put the book down, and could hardly wait for book two.  Now I need book three, which has not yet been published.<br />Regina Blake is the beautiful daughter of the Viscount Lord James Blake, who has served in the military in Egypt for most of his career, and nearly all of her life.  Lady Blake is ill, and must return to England to be cared for, yet when they leave Egypt, her brother refuses to join them, and father and son are estranged.<br />In their English manor, Lady Emma Blake dies -- was it murder, which it certainly appears to be, or something far darker.  Her mother's family, the Ducheski clan, descends on the estate to bury Emma according to their traditions.  In Regina's search for the burial place of her mother, she finds far more than any girl should see.<br />Regina believes she is in control of her nightly wanderings in London.  She can no longer talk with her father, who has turned his anger at his wife's death to the liquor bottle.<br />Systematically Regina is seduced into a complex relationship with Victoria Ash, who becomes her sponsor and introduces her to the true nightlife in London.  Victoria is also the only one who can save Regina's life during the Morbid Initiation.<br />I cannot begin to reveal the story in a short review -- it is fascinating, dark, delicious, frightening, enlightening, and horrific.  It is one of the best books, not just one of the best horror novels, that I have read.

Sonja Blue's &quot;inner demon&quot; is a vampire that is ruthless and demands human blood and great sacrifice.  This personality takes control, and Sonja dreams the events in nightmares that she discovers are real.<br />Yet Sonja the vampire is also a vampire hunter, and wants to rid the world of these dark hearted villains, which would ultimately mean she also must die after the last vampire does.  She dares not have close attachments to any mortal, for when the fiend inside her gets free, the man or woman Sonja has learned to care for will be attacked, and then lust, and desire addict them to the vampire's blood.  It is their blood that heals her and their only release is death, and they are so caught up in the hunger for her they do not mind.<br />Now Sonja is the target of a vampire hunter named Jack Estes, and an ancient vampire with the darkest heart.  Jack is human, he would destroy Sonja, therefore, and she must convince him of her nature -- and will have to reveal its duplicity, which keeps him in danger at all times.<br />For fans of Nancy Collins' vampire series, this is a winner.  For those of us who inadvertently pick this book as the first to read, it is difficult.  For me to know Sonja, I would have to read books one through four, so I found the shifts inconceivable and her duplicity difficult to follow.<br />A writer does not reach book five in a series without a large following.  This book is for those readers, not for first time readers of the Sonja Blue chronicles.	2003-08-19

This is the first book in which Deirdre Griffin was the foremost character that I have read, and it will certainly not be the last.  I was fascinated, as I always am, with Taylor's work.  The subculture she creates in which vampires are part of society is plausible, as is the news media which is the way The Others track them for destruction.  For a vampire is safe only as long as a vampire is a myth -- when the truth of their real existence is known, they must flee.<br />The Others are an intriguing breed created to house souls.  Of course, they know vampires are real, and the hungers, desires, needs, that lived in them before, return.  Even a human soul can be placed in an Other body.  The soul is dormant until awakened, and old enemies return, as do those who have been loved.<br />I loved the freedom of the shape shifting vampires, and found I longed to run without tiring as they did.  Taylor explores this amazing quality in ways I have not read before.  There is a reason for each character and each scene, for every word and expression.  They are the ingredients for a plot that is entwined with past, present, and future.<br />She weaves love and danger, suspicion and change, energy and despair into her characters, and they change.  The mark of a good author is to let the characters tell their own stories.  Taylor is a master.  Be prepared, the end, the cliffhanger, will probably drive you forward for the sequel to Resurrection.<br />Karen Taylor fans will not be disappointed, and those who are new to the terrors she creates are in for a treat.  I give this five stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2003-08-19

Even though I was warned to not start reading this book when I was ready to go to sleep, I figured that I could read for fifteen minutes, then call it a night.  That was about 11:00 PM.  A few minutes later I glanced at the clock -- it was after 3:30 AM.  That is a page-turner.<br />24 Hours was released in paperback in July 2001, then re-released as Trapped.  It is the basis for the movie starring Kevin Bacon, Charlize Theron, and Courtney Love.  Many elements contributed to the book's success and ultimate destiny as a film.  Paramount is the story telling that allows the reader to suspend disbelief, which is not that difficult due to due to the recent slate of child abductions and the aftermath.  We see events like this happening, and our own knowledge interpreted by imagination creates the horror Iles describes.<br />This is more than a suspenseful thriller.  It taps into the psychology of criminal and victim, woman and mother, father and hunter, prey and survivor.  The characters are deep, and deeply disturbing.  To play out a kidnapping and keep those involved from ever discussing it, is masterful.  The villain has done this every year for five years, and it has never been reported.  The plot shows the complexities of the intricate plans of a methodical and intelligent man who has turned to crime, but he when he makes a mistake and chooses the wrong target it changes all of the rules.<br />Unfortunately, some of the reviews of the movie indicate that it was not translated onto celluloid well, but it deserves five stars as a novel...	2002-10-12

Witches brew their strongest potions, and cult worshipers gather in the darkness to perform their deeds away from light.  The vampire rises and rules the night.<br />Certain qualities are associated with astrological signs.  Predictions  and karmic charts are based on the date, location, and time of birth.

How many brilliant flashes of inspiration lead to books, movies, or plays?  Not many because ideas wither away without great characters and events that drive the story forward.  Although this book is plot development, Noah Lukeman addresses the threads that are woven throughout the story in order to create the fabric from which beautiful, lasting images are created.<br />He uses many examples from film because this is the media where life is visualized for the audience, and his \\"chief concern is illustrating (sometimes abstract) points.\\"  (Lukeman)<br />An example:<br />*  A young man is unhappy and feels trapped in his rural life.<br />*  He hungers for adventure.<br />*  He is inducted into thrilling adventures by chance.<br />*  He is part of a mystical adventure, for which he is unprepared.<br />*  Circumstances force him to face his inadequacies.<br />* He gains friends and companions along the way.<br />* Ultimately he finds the confidence he needs to succeed.<br />* He saves the realm.<br />The ideas belongs to many stories from Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter to Star Wars, and more.  The magic of each story is wrapped into the characters and the lives they live; they are real.<br />Each chapter and the introduction are deeper than I can show in a review.  The book should be on every writer's desk.<br />Both chapters one (Characterization: The Outer Life) and two (Characterization: The Inner Life) are 90 percent questions.  I decided that a great addition to the book would be a CD listing of all of the questions.  However, as I read and contemplated the details a writer must know about the people who live in their stories, I realized that a CD would make it too easy.  By taking time to write the questions and answer them, they become part of a writer's arsenal.  Even more significant is the gathered information can generate ideas to carry the story forward and create new plots.<br />Chapter Three -- Applied Characterization discusses whether the character is major or minor, the frequency s/he appears, entrances and exits, and more.  \\"Plot does not magically appear with the creation of a character; Frankenstein's monster might open his eyes, but until he gets up from the table and does something, there is little basis for a plot.\\"  (NL)  Think of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde -- if the elixir he drank had killed him there would be no story, yet if it was murder mystery a or ghost story the death is instrumental to the plot.<br />Chapter Four -- The Journey takes us on an emotional or mental experience (not necessarily a trip) that brings about change.  Simple and familiar examples are Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, The Bourne Identity, Speed, Cujo, Carrie, etc.<br />Chapter Five -- Suspense, \\"more than any other element, affects the immediate, short-term experience of the work.\\"  (NL)  What is the destination, why is it significant, and what obstacles stand in the way?  In The Lord of the Rings, if the dark riders killed the young hero Frodo, then there would be no story.  The suspense is heightened because we know the ring has been awakened, it is calling to its dark master, and Frodo (and anyone near him) is in grave danger.  This is how J.R.R. Tolkien created the roller coaster.  A great writer constantly raises the stakes and provides some relief between encounters.<br />Chapter Six -- Conflict causes changes; they can be obvious (court, sports, or battle scenes, etc.) or subtle, such as Sandra Bullock's role in Miss Congeniality: Gracie Hart must become Gracie Lou Freebush, a beauty queen.  No matter what the conflict is, it must exist on multiple levels because people, therefore characters, are complex.  One single conflict is not enough to propel a plot.<br />Chapter Seven -- Context \\"influences suspense, conflict, pacing, progression, and ultimately meaning.\\"  (NL)  A writer or editor must keep the entire work in mind, and gauge the overall impression of each element in the creation of the story -- does it work?  Judging repetition of information is one of the important steps.  The keys in a murder mystery may be listed for analysis, but repeating the scenes can be disastrous and boring, yet might be necessary to solve the case.  The obscure repetition of inferred information can also be deadly.<br />Chapter Eight -- Transcendency taps \\"...into the universal, timeless truths and facets of the human condition.\\" (NL)  The examples are clear and powerful.<br />The Plot Thickens: 8 Ways to Bring Fiction to Life is profound, and as I read, I applied much of the information to my own life -- in the end, I am richer than I was before I opened the first page.  The highest compliment I can give to a book is that it made a difference to me.<br />Noah Lukeman's books should be required reading.

Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \\"he is the one.\\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-07-25

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone<br />ISBN: 0590353403<br /><br />How did Harry Potter become a household word?<br /><br />I am intrigued by the phenomena of Harry Potter, and this review is a writer / editor's perspective.  The plot and characters are well known and described in many reviews, so I will not address them.<br /><br />I purchased all four books over two years ago, but they sat on my shelf unread.  Then, I was away from home without a book, and a friend loaned me her copy of The Sorcerer's Stone.  Within two weeks, I read all four books.  Why?<br /><br />J. K. Rowlings captures the imagination with prose that draws her readers in.  Details that are not in the movie, such as Harry's hair that stayed one length no matter how often it was cut, which showed that he was a wizard, but did not know it.<br /><br />* He was different from his peer group; isolated in a world of Muggles.  Children often feel isolated and mistreated, as do adults, therefore most people can relate to this situation.<br />* He is an orphan who believes his parents died in a car crash, and he has no pictures of them.  He longs to belong, an emotion that is common in all ages.<br />* His room was a closet under the stairs, he never received gifts or a kind word, and was viewed as something to get through by his guardians.  In reality, anyone treated like this is abused.  Yet Harry kept a positive attitude, and enjoyed the privacy the room gave him.  He made the best of bad circumstances.<br />* His cousin was a pampered slob, but he was created by his parents' overindulgent behavior.  He received 36 presents for his birthday, but it was not enough.  Things do not replace guardianship.<br />* Harry, small for his age, was the object of ridicule.  Magic delivered him.  Who does not dream of a magical solution to their problems?  This is a writer's tool known as \\"deus ex machina\\" or \\"God out of a machine.\\"<br />* Commonly, in editing, this is the \\"hand of God\\" tool.  It is generally used in an unconvincing plot, character, or event, however, Rowlings success is because she foreshadowed the magic as part of Harry's character through the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.<br />* Using this plot device \\"whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object\\" is a writer's tool.<br /><br />Other aspects of the writing itself are:<br />* Rowlings does not talk down to her audience of young adults.<br />* The same story elements that appeal to a child, appeal to an adult; and the book is unique and readable.<br />* Her characters grow, change, and make decisions based on their own motives.<br />* Life is not simple; people do die.<br />* Good and evil exist, as they do in reality, in many guises.<br />* She takes time to set up the characters, plot, and scenes.  I wondered why she dedicated so many pages to Privet Drive.  This introduced Harry, and because we know how he is treated, we know why Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry immediately becomes his home.  He was wanted.<br />* It is easy to read.  The text flows naturally, even with strange words and unusual names.<br />* Her creativity and descriptions bring life to the story, and you want to know what happens next.<br /><br />Rowlings did not expect her marvelous story to capture readers from all age groups.  She was surprised to be compared to L.Frank Baum who wrote the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />Now I, like million of J. K. Rowlings fans from all over the world, anxiously await the next book.

Read, follow the checklists, and complete the exercises included with each chapter.  Check your versions in the Answers to Exercises section of the book.  Applying the techniques within this book will help you write, not just for publication, but something that is memorable.<br /><br />\\"Authors who sell well are almost always certain to go to the highest bidder, and publishers can't reasonably afford to develop an author for a competing house.\\"  (Browne, King)  The business of publishing changed, and those great editors who supported their clients and helped create stellar books are gone.  The business is about making money.  Therefore, \\"self editing is probably the only kind of editing your manuscript will ever get.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 1: Show and Tell.  The difference is 'to tell' is to describe what happened through a narrative summary, while 'to show' is to experience what happens.  With the use of cartoon sketches, the concept is clearly revealed.  Yet, pacing is important and you accomplish this by slowing the scene with narrative summary, or descriptions.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Characterization and Exposition.  \\"A lot of readers seem to feel they have to give their readers a clear understanding of a new character before they can get on with their story.\\"  This stops the story.  Each character is psychoanalyzed and physical details are listed.  It may not seem like a list, but it is.  \\"When you define your characters the minute you introduce them, you may be setting boundary lines...\\" rather than letting your characters grow.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Point of View.  Many times a switch in POV is subtle, but it changes the perspective and makes it hard for readers to relate to the characters in the scene, story, or book.  The first person POV is limiting, yet it is an excellent exercise because you can only know what \\"I\\" experience.  The omniscient POV is informative, and narrative summary is an aspect.  In using the third person POV, which is the compromise between the two, it is imperative to stay in one person's mind for the entire sequence, or no interior monologues by multiple characters.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Dialogue Mechanics.  \\"If the dialogue doesn't work, the manuscript gets bounced.\\"  Many writers hate to use said, but it is transparent and does not require the reader to interpret the author's expression, which has taken the reader into the writer's head and away from what the characters say.<br /><br />Chapter 5: See How It Sounds.  \\"The creation of character voice ... is one of the most ... challenging acts you can create as a writer.\\"  Why?  Every individual is different, each has their own voice, and so must your characters.  In addition, the dialogue has to be meaningful.  An inane conversation does not move the story forward, it is boring, and it stops the story.  Listen to your dialogue aloud.  Would you say it?<br /><br />Chapter 6: Interior Monologue.  Thoughts are constant, they interrupt our conversations by taking our attention elsewhere.  We live different lives in our own minds, so do your characters, it is emotion and perception that makes them real, and interior monologue is the technique.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Easy Beats.  This is rhythm.  A waltz is playing, what do you see?  It is the Tennessee Waltz, your images change.  Patti Page is not singing the song, a reggae band is.  Each change creates a different feeling because each type of music has its own beat or connection.  Scenes, words, dialogue, and events pace your story.  \\"Beats enable your readers to picture the action in a scene.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 8: Breaking Up is Easy To Do.  Frequent paragraphs can add tension just as a rapid-fire talk show host does.  Readers' eyes move down the page more quickly, which adds momentum.  However, maintaining this pace will wear you out, there will be no sudden surprise.  Slowing the pace lulls the reader, provides intimacy, and creates suspense.  Both are needed.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Once is UsuallyEnough.  Repeating words, phrases, descriptions, and effects are boring.  When a reader knows that a map is missing in chapter one, they still know it in chapter five, they know it until it has been found.  \\"When you try to accomplish the same effect twice, the weaker attempt is likely to undermine the power of the stronger one.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 10: Proportion.  The setup in chapter one must be resolved in the climax, but if another event becomes more important, then the impact of the problem resolution is lost.  If the object is to find the missing map, then a duel in a romantic liaison cannot take half the book; the proportion is off; that single event becomes more important than the premise itself.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Sophistication.  This contains a very good description of \\"the hack's favorite construction.\\"  Take care in using -ing words or linking events with as.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Voice.  \\"A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writes want -- and something no editor or teacher can impart.\\"  It is individual, it belongs to you, and to each character you create.

Readers and editors are over burdened with books, book deals, writers, publicity, and other aspects of their daily routine.  They are expected to read manuscripts at home, so it is no wonder that to get through a large slush pile editors use the precedent: find reasons to reject manuscripts in order to go on to the next one.<br /><br />This book does not teach 'how to write,' but how to avoid the mistakes that send your manuscript to the recycle bin.  That is the craft of writing.<br /><br />To be successful, you have to capture your audience in the first five pages.  Noah Lukeman, a prestigious editor turned agent knows the secrets of successful writing.  In reality, you must capture your reader in the first five words, sentences, or paragraphs with a strong hook and the good writing.<br /><br />Lukeman arranged the chapters in The First Five Pages to show each process in rejecting manuscripts.  Follow the steps, and if you are lucky, you might get a contract.  Do not follow the steps, and the only reason your manuscript will reach the one person who can make a difference is through a fluke.<br /><br />Each chapter concludes with write and rewrite examples and practices.  The Lukeman way is included at the back of the book.  The only way to become a better writer is to write.  The following is only a brief synopsis of a few chapters.<br /><br />Presentation: The number one reason aspiring writers get rejections is that the work is inappropriate for the market.  Simply put: do not send a bodice-ripper, swashbuckling tale to someone representing coffee table books.

Carl Sifakis is a crime reporter and freelance writer who, because he is a journalist and has connections, provides a unique perspective into the secret world of the Mafia.  Mario Puzo brought to life the families behind the secret society, and Sifakis describes the events, terminology, members, murders, techniques, locales, and pawns of the most significant criminal organization in the world.  Although most of the crime families have been publicly decapitated through imprisonment or death of the leaders, studying criminal compositions and actions provide an outline for criminal structures that can be found in terrorist groups today.  Today there are different names, different motives, but follow the money, follow the murders, and history is repetitious.<br />Each letter of the alphabet begins a new heading, making this an easy to access reference book.  A plethora of photographs, which include wanted posters, group 'shots' (sorry, just could not resist the pun), weapons, drawings, and home add to the knowledge base.  As a writer, I find it extremely useful to study the picture and then write the description.<br />\\"Don Vito Cascio Ferro (1862-1932) is often called the 'greatest' of the Maria leaders in Sicily.\\"  The scheme of the protection payoffs in the USA is one of his masterpieces.  Joseph Petrosino, New York police detective, went to Sicily (where Vito had established the key Mafia band) to gather information to bring La Familia before the law.  He was killed before he accomplished his objectives.  One of the theories is that the Mafia chieftain did the job himself.  A rumor he espoused showing his power even over the NYPD.<br />Before 1915 the 'Five Iron Men: Kansas City crime rulers' had corrupted the political structure with only a small number of contingents; few cities west of Chicago could match their control.  Paul Kelly showed that the Italian Mafia could work with other gangsters in the quest for money.  At the demise of the group, their graduates (Torrio, Capone, Luciano, Yale, etc.) went on to \\"raise the highest criminal power during the Prohibition era.\\"<br />The Volstead Act of 1919, commonly known as Prohibition, created new opportunities for criminals to make millions.  Gangsters slaughtered old allies to take over the bootlegging rackets.  Gunshots and explosions were too common in almost every American community of any size.<br />This book is rich and extraordinary.  Sifakis is a good writer, and the encyclopedia is interesting to read.  There are 354 pages of information followed by a good index.  Names are linked to families, locations, and timeframes.

This is an excellent tool for presentation development of statistical information.  Generally, business developers have one chance to grab a client's interest, because even the most astute executive's attention will wander while scanning a list of numbers.<br />Every section in Digital Diagrams is filled with symbols, charts, graphs, and diagrams; and each chapter includes pertinent information regarding the artwork within it.  The most important aspect for a technical writer, design engineer, solutions provider, etc. is to show the specific details rather than tell them.<br />Chapter 1 -- What is a diagram?  Since not all numbers are worth a diagram, it is up to the analyst to determine which datum makes sense to display, and what is the best way to show trends, discrepancies, cartography, art, and other forms of information.  Illustrative Diagrams include simple icons through in-depth  cross sections that are relevant to astronomy, geology, weather patterns, and business concepts.  Tables and graphs are used for statistical diagrams and the various forms that can be used to chart changes.  This Relational diagrams, such as ocean currents, relate to the physical world and fixed locations.  Other diagrams included in this chapter are organizational interrelationships and time charts<br />Chapter 2 -- Making diagrams work.  Information designers develop pictograms that create visual language.  In a world that grows smaller through communications, internationally understood symbols, such as a skull and cross bones, speak in every language.  Pictorial pieces can comprise such things as the step by step creation of an origami bird, the dissection of any organism, the effects of a volcanic eruption to the land or water masses around it, or K-2 and Mt. Kilimanjaro.<br />Chapter 3 -- The digital toolbox discusses page layout software.  Many office programs such as word processors and spreadsheet have good tools built into them.  However, 2-D and 3-D vectoring software provides minute control for a wide range of options.  Raster painting programs enhance these designs with textures and depth.  Many programs include a library of ready-made, royalty free clipart.  This chapter describes the most effective way to use the tools.<br />Chapter 4 -- show case your work.

This is a book for those who break rules; the Emily Post rules, that is.  What's a nice girl like me reading a handbook like this?  Well, when I ordered it, I thought it was about the etiquette of outlaws in the Old West.  I was wrong.  This is information about cultures with which I am not familiar.  I am a writer, a research-aholic, an editor, and have an insatiable curiosity.  Books are inspiration, and this one helps develop characters and their traits to make them believable; from habits to their dress code, and other hidden facets.  Cohen and Wollock (C&W) write with a sense of the absurd, and there are surprises on each page.  Photographs and ready reference charts are included<br />1) This foray begins by identifying the traditional vices: \\"The Basics,\\" which include booze, smoking tobacco in any form, gambling, and strip clubs.  Each is covered in detail.  Drinking, for instance, is divided into the Bar, the alley, and at home.  \\"That alcohol consumption is viewed as both a sin and a sacrament is indeed ironic.\\"  (C&W)<br />2) \\"Sex\\" is comprised of basic sex, porn, alternative sex, and swinging.  Covering (ahem...) the naked truth about strip clubs gives an overview of terms and types of clubs, though the focus is on \\"straight clubs featuring female dancers.\\"  Web sites and content, how to dress or not for a swinger's party, and what some of the rules are provide data and ideas.<br />3) \\"The Accessories\\" are tattoos, piercing, wheels, guns, knives, etc., and meat.  The quote from Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth \\"Out, damn spot.  Out I say!\\" is a reminder that tattoos and piercing are permanent.  What was cool at 19 might be a detriment to a professional career.  Always ask questions before shelling out your money.  Wheels cover how to get from point A to B.<br />4) \\"The Lifestyle:\\" above all, \\"being an outlaw is about attitude.\\"  This chapter is a primer for basic street etiquette, fighting, jokes, bodily functions, and music scene etiquette.  The general law-abiding public must remember that outlaws are not afraid of \\"the law.\\"  Photographs of a few sign language maneuvers and what they could mean told me that I could not tell the difference between \\"Peace\\" and \\"Blood Rolling 205.\\"<br />5) \\"The Professionals\\" are the porn star, the rock star, the gang-banger, graffiti artist, and dominatrix.  The section \\"provides an insider's peek into some very exclusive clubs and subcultures...\\" The dominatrix is there to punish you.  They (both men and women) play to the pleasure-pain sensations.<br />6) Going into rehab begins in \\"The Aftermath.\\"  The law and you, going to court, jail, homeless etiquette, and suicide are the topics.  The desire for freedom from whatever must come first for anyone to get out of the destructive cycles.  This section is based on the ABC's of AA.<br />7) Last is \\"Travel -- Shining Abroad.\\"  This segment covers where you can get what you want outside the US and obey their laws...  One tip that is valuable to any traveler is to read a map; if you don't know where you are going you just might end up where you did not want to be.<br />However, would I buy this book again?  No.  Although it is a good writer's resource and describes a life I have never lived, it is just not my style.  I can only give it four stars.

In San Francisco, a young man could not stop himself from drawing nearer the rocky shore; the ocean called to him, to his soul.  Then he was swept into the sea.  Rescue seems impossible, yet he is saved; saved by a Mayfair witch for reasons even she knows nothing about.  Just as seaweed wraps around the legs and arms of unwary divers trapping them until only the blade of a knife will set them free, love entangles these two people.  They travel to New Orleans, where a ancient mansion is alive with the secrets of the past.  Shadows and Spanish Lace that hangs from the old trees were a barrier to passersby who would peek through the gates--that and ghosts.<br />In a powerful opening sequence, Anne Rice develops an intriguing story with rich characters that drew me into the story of the Mayfair Witches.  The tale moves along well through the historical journals of past witches, who they were and how they came to power; a history that crosses the centuries and reveals a sense of their destiny and the corruption that binds this lineage.<br />Then the problem begins.  Anne Rice retells the journal story from a new witch as she learns about her ancestors.  Had this section been her reaction rather than a rehashing of the same material, then it might have added more than pages to the book, but it did not.  This is a significant detriment to the book, but it was woven into events that were occurring  in the same timeline, which made it difficult to skip.<br />Lasher, a Taltos, is ancient yet newborn.  He is seductive and demanding as the Mayfair ghost.  He is also brutal, cunning, and demonic, but this side of his character is not revealed until he gains the ultimate prize.<br />It has been several years since I read The Withching Hour, yet it stays with me as great storytelling always does.  But I still cannot figure out why such a talented writer fell into trap of duplicating information; all it did was add a hundred or so pages.  For that reason I give it 4 stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani/>Victoria Tarrani	2002-05-26

What is it in a story that takes it to the New York Times Best Seller List for three years or 156 weeks?  When I read this book, that was what I wanted to know.  I look at the book on the shelf and think, &quot;What was there that I just did not get?&quot;<br />The love story set in the 1960s is about Robert Kincaid, a renowned photographer, and a Francesca Johnson, a farm wife.  The story is based on her diaries and the personal effects he had sent to her after he died.<br />She is secluded and alone much of the time.  When Robert comes to photograph the bridges, her family is away at the state fair.  They are, like Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers who will only remain in each other's hearts and minds for all of their life, though they only shared four days.  Her diaries indicate that for about thirty years Francesca maintained the emotional contact she committed to Kincaid by seeing his photography in National Geography, news clippings, and reading the articles written about him.<br />It is easy to be in love for four days.  Anyone can.  New love is exciting, romance is thrilling, and a new lover's touch is magical.  Yes, it will last forever -- if you do not have to wake up to reality.  It was simple to see this aspect of the enchantment about their story.  Francesca wrote of the agony that she felt when choosing whether to go with Kincaid or stay with her family, her children.  This was the crux of her story; stay with her husband and children, or run off with a stranger.<br />I could never understand that, my child is first.  Today the book is on my daughter's shelf, and she knows more about the emotions that drove Kincaid and Francesca than I ever will.  I am too practical; but she tells me I have never loved as they did -- and she just might be right because I still wonder why this book sold millions.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the romantic interlude.<br />Perhaps I should have seen the movie (I am a Clint Eastwood fan). For me the book was worth three stars, but the millions of people who loved this book and movie cannot all be wrong, so it must be a five.

One day it was sent home in the knapsack of a child whose mother is a literary agent...\\"  (Robert Fulghum) Thus history was written -- serendipitous indeed.  I have read the chain message, which lists these gems, many times from various Internet friends, throughout the years.  Many of the phrases are clich&eacute;s now because of the truth within the words.<br />Finding fragments of our own lives in these pages is easy.  Fulghum consolidated his extensive Credo of life into a simpler format, such as: \\"Remember the Dick and Jane books and the first word you learned -- the biggest word of all -- is LOOK.\\"  Look both ways... look into the heart of the matter... look at yourself... look at history... look what happened... look at what you missed....<br />All of the kindergarten principles are found in the first three pages, and then Fulghum reveals how he applied these ideals throughout his life.  One example is his encounters with a neighbor who was a \\"raker and a shoveler.\\"  He picked up the leaves and shoveled away the snow, but with the attitude of you \\"can't let old Mother Nature get ahead of you,\\" and considered Fulghum to be a lazy neighbor.  The leaves pile up, become mulch, and make more earth.  The snow melts and feeds the land.  Nature has taken care of itself for a long time.  I imagined someone going into the woods and everywhere else, daily gathering leaves in a constant frustrating battle, and at season's change shoveling the snow from one place to another.  Of course, I would want the leaves raked up and the snow shoveled off the driveway and sidewalk, but my dad, who understood the cycle, put the greens in the garden.<br />Fulghum shows the fallacy of gender encoding through a simple example about cars -- the Y chromosome does not mean a man knows about jumper cables.  \\"Besides, this guy only asked me if I 'had' jumper cables, not if I knew how to 'use' them.\\"  He describes an incident where he and the stranded collaborator swaggered around, \\"being all macho and cool and talking automobile talk.\\"  They looked under the hood of the car, and there was no battery.  \\"'Hell,' I said, 'there's your problem right there.  Somebody stole your battery.'\\"<br />In these marvelous vignettes, Fulghum shows a simpler way to look at those things we confront in life.  The book was first published in 1986, and it is still being published.  Very few books survive this long -- only the good ones do.

Terry Brooks' introduction to Fantasy Reference is a writer's guide in disguise.  He learned from his editor of fifteen years that \\"It is harder to write good fantasy than any other form of fiction.\\"  Why?  \\"The temptation to free-fall through a story chock full of incredible images and wonderful beings can be irresistible -- but, when not resisted, almost invariably disastrous.\\"  The book is worth the price just for this introduction, but there is so much more.<br />Chapter 1: Traditional Fantasy Cultures.  These essays help writers get a sense of history for their fantasy tale to develop successfully.  These include Feudalism, Christianity, Knighthood, Political Entities, and more.  Each of the main topics is subdivided for ready reference.  For example: Peripheral Cultures provides a brief history of the Mongols, Moors, Magyars, Normans, Picts, Saracens, Saxons, and Vikings.<br />Chapter 2: World Cultures are a critical backdrop in any story.  \\"Nevertheless, many fantasy novels today seem to be set in an unending series of northern European countrysides...\\" (Michael J. Varbola) This chapter discusses science, art, military, economy, etc., to help writers make the places real and visual.  There are great ideas here.<br />Chapter 3: Magic.  The heart of a good fantasy is the magic that binds the world together or can rip it apart.  Reading the history of magic helps writers understand spells, and know how the culture developed within Magic's realm.<br />Chapter 4: Witchcraft and Pagan Paths describes ways to recognize a witch, what witchcraft is, traditions and religions, and herbs.  An example is \\"weik\\" is an Indo-European root word having to do with religion and magic.<br />Chapter 5: Commerce, Trade, and Law in Contemporary Fantasy begins \\"It is a misconception that the Middle Ages was broken into three factions: those who worked, those who fought, and those who prayed.\\"  (Sherrilyn Kenyon)  This chapter discusses the infrastructure that made civilization work.  It is filled with elements that any writer needs.<br />Chapter 6: Fantasy Races shows the physical similarity or differences between (e.g.,) elves and dwarves; these are the descriptions defined by myths and legends, and are, therefore, plausible.  You will find many other topics within this chapter that can help your definitions.  Years ago I read about a hero who was killed, and at the moment of his death, he called out to one of the mythical gods to save him.  Instead of dying, he fell into a different land in the body of an elf.  I laughed so much when this protagonist called himself a Vulcan.<br />Chapter 7: Creatures of Myth and Legend has an alphabetical listing of these creatures, the country of origin, the appearances, and magic.  For example, a banshee lives in Irish legend, and wails when death is approaching.  Lorelei is a water spirit of German legends.<br />Chapter 8: Dress and Costume is about the materials, designs, clothing, and more.  Many drawings accompany the descriptions to provide a rich and fertile field in which imagination can play.<br />Chapter 9: Arms, Armor, and Armies provides writers an overview of ancient and medieval battle gear.  In the dictionary, you will find, for example, that a javelin is a light spear; the pilum has a soft metal neck so that bends on impact and can easily be removed from a shield.  The Gallic term is gaesum; the Roman is pilum.  There are diagrams of a suit of armor (front and back), with the terms labeled so you know where a poleyn, cuisse, or greave is worn.<br />Chapter 10: Anatomy of a Castle is required reading for fantasy writers to create the look, feel, smell, vision, and every other aspect, of a castle.  There are diagrams of different castles such as a typical medieval one, the Great Wall of China, or Himeji Castle.  This information can help you build a castle.  If you are using castles, be sure to draw them out so that you know where the catwalk, curtain walk, bastion, and other places are.  Thatwill help keep your characters moving in the right direction.<br />There is a flaw in the book is the binding, which breaks easily if you open it too far.  To me, this is minus 1/4 of a star because I want my books to last, no matter how many times I read them.  However, books can be replaced, the knowledge they bring cannot.

Many dream dictionaries simply list words and their meanings.  The symbols are obtuse because our mind is revealing information to us, but hiding it at the same time.  Pamela Bell has methods for managing dreams, starting with KISS, or Keep It Simple, Stupid.  It is not that anyone is stupid, but we over complicate, over interpret, over analyze what symbols may mean, and we lose the simplicity of the message.<br />The book is divided into sections, and long before you come to the interpretations of dream symbols, if you read the book sequentially, you will have a background that you can apply, and learn how to guide your dreams.  The following is a short synopsis of each segment.<br />Introduction: \\"Dreams thus perform at least two functions, and interestingly these activities are relevant to the attributes of the two separate halves of the brain.\\"  (Bell)  Every day our conscious minds are bombarded with images and thoughts, noises, colors, aromas, then, at night, when the conscious mind eases control, we review and interpret, and frequently solve problems; sometimes waking up to know the answer to complicated problems, or whatever may have been perplexing.<br />The Dream Interpreters: The most famous dream interpreter, in my opinion, is Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob and firstborn of Rachel.  He was sold into slavery, yet he was the one who interpreted the Pharaoh's dreams of the feast and famine years that would come upon the land.  Bell follows the history of a few dream interpreters to show the changes from parlor games to therapy.  She includes a short list of archetypal symbols.<br />Sleeping and Dreaming: \\"Sleep is a way of turning away from the external stimuli by which we are bombarded daily to an inner landscape which permits regeneration and rejuvenation.\\" (Bell)  I am an insomniac, so I frequently miss this part of the dream.  She covers this disorder and many others, and gives tips to sleep better, including a list of herbs that may help.<br />Dream Interpretation: \\"Just as a child learns that certain words represent certain object, the dreamer begins to understand his or her own dream language.\\" (Bell) This is the reason that there are many dream dictionaries, and why we do not necessarily know what we are telling ourselves.<br />How to be a Creative Dreamer: The common term is lucid dreaming, and it is where you control your dream.  Once, when a knife wielding threat was attacking me, I woke myself up by saying, \\"This is a nightmare!\\"  To analyze your dream you must experience yourself as the things and people within.  In that dream, I was telling me what I already knew, but had not really faced.  This chapter is rich with information and suggestions, including several guided dreams.<br />Dream Dictionary: These are the nuggets that we use to try to interpret the dream.  This section is divided into elements: (1) Animals, (2) Environments in Dreams, (3) Journey, and (4) People.  Then Bell provides an alphabetical listing of various words.  Unlike many other books, she does not say, for example: Butterfly is one's own transformation, but that the butterfly represents freedom, although it can also \\"indicate a lack of ability to settle down or to take a protracted task.\\"  The interpretation is up to you, and it is therefore based on your current situation.<br />Dream Workbook: \\"The following pages are for the reader's personal use.  They suggest various methods which can be used in your own journals, and for your own private interpretations.\\"  (Bell)  Nearly every book about understanding dreams suggests a dream journal; it is the flow of life.<br />This is an excellent addition to my dream dictionary collection.  One of the things I have learned about dreams and messages is this: If I do not get it the first time, my mind will send the dream again, but simpler.

Unlike many other books, she does not say, for example: Butterfly is one's own transformation, but that the butterfly represents freedom, although it can also \\"indicate a lack of ability to settle down or to take a protracted task.\\"  The interpretation is up to you, and it is therefore based on your current situation.<br />Dream Workbook: \\"The following pages are for the reader's personal use.  They suggest various methods which can be used in your own journals, and for your own private interpretations.\\"  (Bell)  Nearly every book about understanding dreams suggests a dream journal; it is the flow of life.<br />This is an excellent addition to my dream dictionary collection.  One of the things I have learned about dreams and messages is this: If I do not get it the first time, my mind will send the dream again, but simpler.  Five stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-05-03

Describing the contents of one of the most beneficial grammar books I study is difficult, though it is easy to read, research, check, verify, and use.  Diana Hacker has written many books to help people understand and use the English language in the correct way.  This is a heritage that also protects the language for future generations, just as dictionaries do.<br />The Main Menu is divided into topics and the sections that relate to it.  Within each of these is a category breakdown, as follows:<br />Composition/Style:<br />(C) Composing and revising, (D) Document Design, (E) Effective sentences, and (W) Word Choices.<br />Correctness:<br />(G) Grammatical sentences, (T) ESL Trouble spots, (P) Punctuation, and (S) Spelling and mechanics.<br />Research/ Basic Grammar:<br />(R) Research Writing, (M) MLA documentation, (A) Alternative styles of documentation, and (B) Basic grammar.<br />The index is also helpful.  I selected a topic at random--adjective phrases:  (1) Infinite, 350, (2) participle, 349, (3) prepositional, 348-349, (4) punctuation of, 198, 205.<br />The format displays what type of information is on that page.  (1) Page 350 is B for basic grammar information, as are 348 and 349.  Pages 98 and 205 are P or punctuation.<br /><br />This book is on my desk, and is one of the most useful tools I own.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Any serious writer, editor, or student needs it.  5 stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-04-30

Those who guide come in many guises, including nature's creations.  I use the information in Totems both as a writer and personally because it is possible to transform your life; people can change their future.<br />Being in tune with your own force is the most intense sensation of peace that you can find.  I have known my spirit guide for many years, and have found that other animals come into my realm, or totem, as my needs change.  When my niece was four I began calling her Rabbit, and when she grew up, she asked me why.  My brother's family had kept pet rabbits for years; based on what he saw, he disagreed with what I said of the rabbit.  Several years later, in Totems, I discovered that my ideas were those of the Native Americans.<br />Animals are significant throughout history.  The zodiac links human traits to fish (Pisces), bulls (Taurus), crabs (Cancer), lions (Leo), scorpions (Scorpio), and goats (Capricorn).  Egyptians worshipped Bask, the Cat-Mother goddess, while South American tribes revered the leopard or panther, and animals represent all twelve years in the Chinese zodiac.<br />You do not pick your guides, but if you watch the animals that cross your path you will see the guide and can learn the messages they bring to you.  Once you train yourself to not just see a cricket or a bee, but to see the messenger, then you discover the message.  Butterflies land on me when I am going through changes, or should be.  When I see hawks, I should pay greater attention to my dreams.<br />This book includes some details on relaxation and meditation; some numerology; some information about the Medicine Wheel, but none is as in-depth as the information about totems.  This is a good primer, and I give Totems four stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-04-27

While you may find that something that is growing in your own back yard could cut down on the grocery bill, this book is also a great tool for a writer, and that is my view.<br />Wild Plants is divided by seasons, and what is edible just in case you are surviving in nature's wonderland without fast food places just three miles down the road.  On the other hand, what to eat when a flood in ... well, any place that strands your protagonists for weeks.<br />The color photographs show the shapes and colors of the leaves and berries, which makes describing a meal easier.  A map of the U. S. is coded to show you where the plants are likely to grow.  Additionally, there are many details about the plants, such as what part to eat and whether it can be a full meal or just a salad.  One of the most important details included about the plants is a list of poisonous look-alikes.  For example the Eastern camass, Camass Lily is edible during all seasons; the baked bulbs are very dark and sugary, but baking to perfection takes 1-3 days.  However, the bulbs are palatable raw, or can be boiled in 25-30 minutes.  The look-alike Death Camass has several differences, one being that the edible plant has blue flowers in the spring; so what does your hungry character eat while escaping?<br />A section about poisonous plants describes twenty that are toxic, and that grow beside the ones you can eat.  Nature provides its own clue about the plants.  By watching what and when the birds and wild life eat the odds decrease of choosing the wrong plant.  There is a great picture of the Death Camass that grows in the west and north west states, as indicated by the map.  \\"All twelve of the native Zigadenus species should be considered extremely poisonous.\\"  They contain alkaloids that can cause gastrointestinal distress that can lead to death.<br />Enjoy the recipes, or cook them up for your characters.  I give this five stars for photography, information, and an easy to use reference book.<br />Victoria Tarrani/>Victoria Tarrani	2002-04-27

Gerard Arnaud St. Laurue, an ancient vampire, wants to publish his memoirs.  If Damion Kirk writes a sequel, maybe he will reveal some of these adventures -- Reflections of a Vampire is not an interview filled with flashbacks.  This book is pure action with people (both undead and alive) whom you care about.<br />St. Laurue has not written this manuscript, but his deadline is less than one week, when he must take his millennium rest where he will sleep below the ground for 18 months.  Also, he must have minions to keep him safe, but he has not found those to whom he must trust his existence either.<br />These vampires have human qualities such as family ties -- a blood feud between St. Laurue, his sister Brigitte and their father the Marquis Antoine DeMalberet, who has ancient tricks to keep the kids in check.  There is the Daemonion Council operatives with special powers who inadvertently get involved with the police who are searching for a serial killer.<br />I do not want to reveal too many details, but there are so many characters and sub-plots that each page is filled with an adventure.  Kirk's descriptions are vivid with images that are memorable and frightening.  Some of the scenes you might not want to &quot;see,&quot; but you will.  I shuddered, checked the closets for anything amiss -- such as a vampire hiding among my clothes, and came right back to reading.  He is a master storyteller, and has written a true page-turner!<br />By the way, as I write this review, I want to be sure the vampires know that I respect them...  just in case... and hopefully that will get rid of the chill down my spine... that feeling that someone is looking over my shoulder...<br />Though I do not normally mention the publisher, I am making an exception.  The publishing company is RahuBooks.  This is a new firm, and if this first book is any indication of future books, this is a winning company.  The paper is heavier than other paperbacks with strong binding (for those of us who hate to have a book fall apart as we are reading it).<br />I give five stars to this winner.

If the disk (a small CD-ROM) really is over 1000 years old, then our technology has just reached the point to read it -- as prophesized in the text itself as they unravel the symbols.  The language is ancient Aymara.  This book is fast paced and is based on an intriguing plausibility of how the Inca civilization may have advanced so quickly.<br />The disk is processed through several decryption programs without success, but it is Diana Travest's knowledge of the ancient Peruvian language of Aymara that helps Matt Sousa find the Key of Keys (KoK).  They need more information before announcing such a find -- if it is not a true antiquity, it will destroy their reputations as archaeologists.  Translations of the small, encrypted file refer to &quot;The Source.&quot;  They must return to Peru to find it.<br />Meanwhile, the Sendero Luminoso, a revolutionary group, needs money for weapons.  The group has internal conflict, and has not paid for their last shipment.  They will, however, force their buyer (whose identity is no longer hidden from them) to front the money himself.<br />R J Fanler, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur is working on a way to process data.  The technology that he wants to develop is as different as a computer is from a typewriter; an upgrade of that magnitude could drive old established companies to &quot;catch up,&quot; or perhaps dry up.  He also is fascinated by space and unexplained mysteries, and he will finance the dig.<br />These various forces are on separate paths, but they will clash over this discovery.  Matt Sousa is a graduate student in Archaeology; he found the original disk.  His colleague, the woman he loves, is kidnapped.  Matt's secret weapons are his Special Forces training; RJ Fanler, the entrepreneur with the money; and a former SF associate.  They will try to rescue Professor Diana Travest and the antiquity called &quot;The Source.&quot;<br />Roger Pressman is well known in the world of technology.  Author of &quot;Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach,&quot; which is required reading for software engineers, and six additional technology books.  This is his first venture into fiction, and The Aymara Bridge is a strong combination of a plot and character driven novel, with the additions of international intrigue, high finances, ideologies, and guerilla tactics.  I could not put it down.<br />All of the elements that make a great movie are in place in The Aymara Bridge.

The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;<br />What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;<br />His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.<br />Some of my favorite passages are:<br />Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;<br />Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;<br />Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;<br />Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;<br />Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-04-10

These lists are placed at the beginning of each section, and the following page numbers begin at one again.  However, not in the case of the Poems and Sonnets, which are in the Historical Plays list.<br />There is an additional list for the exquisite plates, which add another dimension to the historical significance of this library.

Karma can loosely be defined as fate or destiny based on our past actions.  What if I knew my lover before?  Where is my soul mate?  &quot;This book isn't about finding an ideal partner or changing your current one,&quot;  (Petullo) it is a pathway to the unresolved issues that dictate how and whom we love, including ourselves.<br />There have been many approaches to relationships, but the strength of Steven Petullo's methodology is that this is a guide to self-discovery.  Whether &quot;people don't care about past lives anymore&quot; or not, has no part in the training he outlines for personal growth.  If we are willing to create a playground for our minds, then we can believe in the possibility.<br />The ability to suspend disbelief is one that we all practice in order to enjoy a good novel, scream at scary scenes, feel emotions as if they were ours while watching a movie, and occasionally accept press releases as truth.  With the mind free of the constraint of belief, we can view our relationship questions on any canvas that we choose.<br />We find our canvas through meditation, which is an art, and it is learned.  Petullo provides guided meditations that will not only teach a beginner how to find this peaceful state, but what questions to ask when there.  The answers we seek are within ourselves -- stored in the subconscious or unconscious mind.  Connecting to ideologies, behavior choices and patterns, actions and reactions, attraction or instant revulsion is the &quot;why.&quot;  Understanding these allows us to determine our own direction in life.  Therefore, it is time to know why you love or do not love certain people.<br />After Petullo discusses analysis and hypnosis, he provides sixteen case histories, which have different questions and answers.  These can open new windows in our understanding, sometimes simply by making us ask questions.  When I was in grade school, one boy used to hit me in my arm every time I passed by him.  I never told anyone, I just thought he was mean.  Yet, accepting that abuse was indicative of a pattern that has affected how I relate to people in this lifetime.  Did I bring some long forgotten hatred or abuse with me?  Perhaps.<br />It does not matter, because the greatest power we have over our own destinies is to forgive others.  Not forgiving creates anger, hatred, or disgust within us, and it does not affect the object of these emotions at all; but the karmic cycle means that we will repeat these relationships until we can let them go.<br />By exercising your mind in the manner described within these pages, you can forgive yourself.  If that sounds odd, it is only because we do not normally think of others who come into our lives as reflections or ourselves, yet they are.  Sometimes they are yin yang, sometimes a puzzle; sometimes we recognize this, and sometimes we do not.<br />Take the road to yourself.

Her characters are fully developed, and it is obvious that she knows them very well.<br />Never having read any of The Vampire Legacy books, this was a real feast.  Vivienne Courbet is a beautiful young woman who recognizes the power of staying young forever, and embraces her new life with zest.  Her nearly three hundred years of exploits are chronicled in this book.  Vivienne has deep emotions and that makes her very real.  Yes, Vampires do have emotions, or Taylor has convinced me that they exist as sensitive monsters.  Not all are sensitive . . . as we soon discover.<br />Max and Victor -- are they good or bad vampires?  That may seem an odd question until you meet Vivienne's lost love.  Diego is vicious, he loves the kill, and he must be destroyed.  The hatred she feels at his death poisons her thoughts, and she returns to the House of the Swan in Paris.  When the French Revolution claws and beheads their way through the aristocracy, she refuses to believe they mean \\"her.\\"  Enter Eduard DeRouchard.  Passion fills their nights from their first gaze.  He is not the perfection our lusty heroine believes him to be; we see that he is too good to be real, but love's first blush is blind.  Additionally, a jealous vampire is dangerous.<br />This book is part of the history of The Vampire Legacy.  Travel with Vivienne from Paris in 1719 to the present day New Orleans.  Definitely, a \\"must\\" for the Legacy fans.

A man who still hates him, and wants the love that Matthew has found.<br />The plot is well woven and the characters are deep and real.  None of this world exists only in the pages of the book.  This world now exists in the turning of a leaf, raindrops, teardrops, the slapping of the water against a boat, and emotions such as hope, love, and irony -- exactly as people everywhere live today.<br />Rita Gerlach is an accomplished author who presents the late 1600's as they were.

Imagine, if you could read a letter and know what the reader was feeling; this book will help you see the ways to do so because in revealing ourselves, we gain self-knowledge and confidence.<br />Five stars are not diminished by the only difficulty I had, which was the very small size of the font.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2002-03-11

This is a book that is right on target for sales professionals and the rest of us.<br />I am not a sales person, though I have been a network systems consultant to many different business organizations. When I began working with Anne Clayton as an editor my technical background was helpful and applicable to earning customer satisfaction, which brings successful selling.<br />However, I had no idea that the knowledge and responsibilities of a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative may affect my own health care.<br />Not only does this book teach the novice how to research, network, and start a career in Pharmaceutical sales, but it also reveals the complete sales process. Therefore, when I went to the doctor after having read this book, I heard a rep teaching (selling) a doctor medications for renal care (kidneys) and diabetes. I watched him interact with the office staff, and realized that he was following the \\"how to\\" steps from \\"Insight into a Career in Pharmaceutical Sales\\" to the letter.<br />I also learned that when my doctor suggests a new medication it is because he has been given up to date information about the products, tests, possible side effects, what it does and does not treat, and samples from a representative of the manufacturing company. This knowledge base may also be available in medical journals and articles from the FDA, but since these professional sales people do not focus on every medication, they will know a great deal about the ones they sell.<br />This book will outline the steps to sales success, and provide insights that are not available from other sources...	2001-12-20

Remember all of the fairy tales that wove morals into fascinating adventures for children?  Michael Mathena did, and has created this treasure in the tradition of Hans Christian Anderson.<br />I read several to my three-year-old companion as she sat across the table from me eating her oatmeal.  She was entranced and wanted to see the pictures.  Though each story is delightfully illustrated in black and white line drawings, they are at the end of a story.  I showed her the pages filled with those amazing alphabet letters that she is learning.  Letters that mean there really is something special in discovering how to read.<br />Every time she looked at the words, my adorable companion said, &quot;Oh.  More, please.&quot;<br />After I finished reading each story to her, we talked about the pictures, and how they also told the story.  The most intriguing part about this particular aspect of our adventure is that she was more fascinated by the story than the pictures.  Michael Mathena is a very gifted storyteller who has created a magical land where a child relies on her imagination.<br />There are eleven stories, each starring a different animal, and happening in a different place in the world.  Because children do care about Chipsy the caterpillar who visits a Hamster Village in Japan, the way is open to talk about foreign and exotic places where there are kids who also want bedtime stories, cookies, and juice, just like they do.<br />The supply of &quot;Bonnie Bluebird's Voyages&quot; is limited.  Michael Mathena has graciously offered to write a personal inscription in each book, and I would not give mine away -- even to my little companion.  What greater gift can a child receive than a world based on their imagination and find that it is dedicated especially for them?<br />I give this five stars and wonder when an astute Hollywood producer will see the possibilities for animation.<br />Victoria Tarranibr />Victoria Tarrani	2001-11-18

Tough questions that many writers have addressed because it is a universal theme.  In one of the best books that I have read dealing with loss, Blueprint is fresh, current, and incredibly astute.  The emotions that carry the story caused me a great deal of introspection.<br />Eddie Diamond is trying to recover from the death of his wife.  He wants to go forward and live, but he also does not.  These sentiments are typical for a depressed and grieving person when they lose someone who is an integral part of their life.  However, Rufus Juskus does not approach the process of grief in a morose way.  Instead, his writing is light, breezy, sharp witted, and quick.<br />Eddie opens his world to an unusual therapist and to the readers.  We see what it is like to be a postal worker, or to be suddenly single trying to fit in with old married friends.  When Eddie does meet someone who touches his heart, we share the guilt and betrayal he feels toward his lost love.<br />While I am not a fan of a plethora of similes in a book, I have to make an exception for Blueprint.  Descriptions dance, and shift like staccato in a fandango.  There are so many examples that I would like to share but all I really can say is that this book is one that I will read again.  I give it five golden stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-11-18

This little jewel &quot;comes on like gangbusters.&quot;  This simile is a clich&eacute;, the bane of good writing; while they are acceptable in dialogue, in prose these truisms transform good writing into mediocre text.<br />This particular clich&eacute; was coined during a 1940's radio program called &quot;Gangbusters,&quot; which opened with gunfire and police sirens showing that the good guys were once more closing in on a gang of thugs.  The term &quot;Gangbusters&quot; is a clich&eacute; in prose, but the scene is a backbone of action movies or TV scripts.<br />How does a writer or editor keep the story from becoming boring by the over usage of clich&eacute;s?  That is where this dictionary comes in.  As an example, I will string a few of the clich&eacute;s together in the following paragraph.  It may give the appearance of originality, but it is as old as the 'grim reaper' (1711).  The humor is in the excessive number of clich&eacute;s, but reading a story put together with clich&eacute;s quickly becomes boring.  I will insert the date the phrase became popular.<br />'Tom, Dick, and Harry' (1604) were 'fit as a fiddle' (1616), though Wally was 'dead as a doornail' (1350).  No one thought about Wally 'in the heat of the battle' (1588) because it was 'do or die' (1809) since they all knew they 'bit off more than they could chew' (1878).  Wally was as 'hard as nails' (1837), and had the 'bird's eye view' (18th century) perched, as he was, 'out on a limb' (1897).  They agreed that Wally should have seen 'that snake in the grass' (13th century) or 'smelled a rat' (1550) when Sam 'cast the first stone' (Bible reference) toward him.  However, Wally always expected a 'square deal' (1633) because 'a friend in need is a friend indeed' (1275), and he had known Sam since 'time immemorial' (1189).  Of course, 'money is the root of all evil' (Timothy 6:10) and Sam was 'rotten to the core' (1718), so it should not be a surprise that he was also 'a cold hearted' (1606) 'eager beaver' (18th century) who 'shot {Wally} to hell' (1706)  'in cold blood' (1608).  Tom, Dick, and Harry could 'go along for the ride' (1960) or 'explore every avenue' (1890) so they could 'divide the spoils' (Isaiah 12:25).  They were, after all, living in 'a den of thieves (Matthew 21:13), and Wally was up there 'on cloud nine' (1950).<br />The Dictionary of Clich&eacute;s is a treasure for writers and editors, and an 'honest to goodness' (1900) delight for everyone else.

Cliff Stoll was an astronomer, but he became the systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.  When he took the position, he discovered a 75-cent accounting error that indicated there was either (1) a bug within the code of the accounting program, or (2) unauthorized users on his system.<br />Science is precise, and therefore Stoll began an investigation that ended up changing the intelligence community.  His extensive testing and experiments revealed not only unauthorized access, but also the flaws of computer security.  He studied the methods, the data path, and the signals (both false and true) through an electronic maze that eventually led him to &quot;Hunter.&quot;<br />Early in his exploration, he discovered a six-second-time delay between transmission and receipt.  It took three seconds for the data link from New York to reach Berkeley.  What happened to the extra three seconds?  Stoll reevaluated his findings, and eventually found the three missing seconds.  It was the transmission time from Europe to New York.<br />The Cuckoo's Egg is Stoll's incredible story that eventually led to Hunter, a group of computer hackers and spies who were connected with the KGB and operating out of Germany.  They had used our own services to piggyback onto valid signals.  They jumped from system to system randomly to meet their goal.  They obtained entrance to highly classified government sites.<br />This is the suspenseful, true story of one scientist's ingenious methods that brought down a spy ring.  I read this book when it was first released and treasure my copy.  Clifford Stoll had included his e-mail address, and graciously responded to my questions.<br />This book is not out-of-date.  It opened the door to the world of computer investigations.  The story is fascinating, and the writing is excellent.  Five stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-10-30

Although I found twelve-year-old Robert's analyses and comprehension to be much older than his years, his insight is highly developed because he is an artistic prodigy.  A Song of Healing is an altruistic and hopeful approach to life, and it shows that a family commitment can break the abuse cycles.<br />Educators can discover many shortcomings in the teaching methods of Robert's teachers and principle, whose actions encourage his classmates to taunt him and drive him even deeper into his own world.  They do not know that he is the chief caretaker for his baby sister.  His mother has had a breakdown and his father is a typical bully.  What is rewarding in this book is that once a family begins to pull together they do overcome the distances that simple survival has created.<br />During a summer in Flagstaff, Arizona with his grandmother, Robert finally releases all of his anger through his drawings.  Then, he begins to see the world with a new perspective.  His portfolio grows with his confidence and knowledge of his own self-worth.  When summer ends and his family reunites, each has found a lost part of themselves.  Everyone except his father, who is as lost as ever.  He bashes into the house, breaks things and Robert, and ends up in jail.<br />The next school year brings Robert to Mr. Spencer.  If there were more teachers like this kind man in today's world, we would find that our children are not simply taught the facts, but the joy of love.  Accepting others without judgments helps each person accept who they are.  This aspect of the book brings hope, and makes it worthwhile to see beyond the rough spots of the first novel from a gifted writer.  Four stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-10-22

I do not base my daily activities on the horoscopes, but it is interesting to read at the end of the day.  Of course, we can make our experiences fit the messages, but some days would have been easier if I'd just read the calendar and thought about the Scorpio Moon that might cause me to be &quot;reactive.&quot;<br />Many times the messages are filled with good advice, such as:<br />Take your creativity outside.<br />Enjoy nature's beauty.<br />Restore peace in your heart.<br />Do not rest on your laurels.<br />Take advantage -- it is a good time for new business.<br />Another feature that I really enjoy is &quot;The birthdate of . . .&quot; notations.

Kathy Hepinstall's second novel is a powerful statement about the disintegration of a family when Alice, our precocious storyteller, was eleven.  She looks back at that time when innocence was destroyed.  The opening sentence is a great hook, and the book lives up to it.  &quot;All these years later, there remains a scar on my face.&quot;<br />Alice and her brother Boone endured their parent's divorce.  They, like all children, hoped their parents would reconcile.  Instead, fate dealt an evil card in the guise of Simon Jester.  Their mother Meg felt discarded by her ex-husband, and her emotional stability rested in the hands of the man who saved her from drowning.<br />Alice and Boone sense Simon's malice, and though they tell Meg that he wants to kill them, she shuns reality.  Then, one night, she goes into her children's room to tuck them in.  Instead, she says, &quot;Run.&quot;  The story that led up to that night is revealed through events that are both terrible and shocking.<br />I took the emotional journey that Alice, Boone, Meg, and a girl named Persley Snow did.  Persley's story is one that catches and holds your attention just as Boone and Alice's involvement with her do.<br />Each chapter ends with an event or emotion that takes you into the next chapter, even if it is 2 AM and you have to up at 5 AM.  I found myself holding my breath as I hurried to read what happened next.<br />This book earns its 5 stars.  I hope that an enterprising producer or director will take it to the theaters or a special mini series.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-09-19

In her debut novel, Bonnie Toews writes the story of WWII as if she lived through it.  From April 6, 1937 through June 1946 characters change according to their experiences in an ever escalating war and the aftermath of its destruction.<br />The book is an entrancing page-turner.  With fresh metaphors, you will feel as if you are in the midst of the story.  I found myself slowing the reading experience in order to savor the words as she reveals both beauty and horror.<br />Kristallnacht (November 9, 1938) was the night the Nazis coordinated an attack on Jewish people and their property in Germany and German-controlled lands.  In a startling scene, Bonnie Toews shows the true terror and shock of that event through imagery that lingers in your memory long after you finish reading the book.  It is a night of unspeakable horrors, but it is also a key to the friendship between Marla Franklin and Lady Catherine.  This friendship carries us through an incredible tale of war, the cost of war, patriotism, betrayal, espionage, love, and success.<br />Details are revealed through dialogue and visual impact.  Your suspicions grow just as they do in the cast of characters.  Toews descriptions are sharp.  The faces and places provide a surrealistic vision as if you are looking through a window or at a collection of photographs.<br />This is a book to be read and read again.  It shows the reality of treason and fills your heart with triumph.  This book would make an excellent movie.  It is five stars.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-09-19

This is a fun book filled with vignettes about the discovery of something that we take for granted today.  Serendipity is a gift for finding something good by accident, luck, or good fortune.  Velcro®, penicillin, X-rays, dynamite, streaking, yes streaking, all have their roots in serendipity.<br />Archimedes was the first streaker.  He calculated a way to measure the actual amount of gold used in a crown that the king had commissioned.  King Hiero had provided the gold, but did not trust the goldsmith.  Archimedes had already written mathematical formulas for finding the volume of a sphere and cylinder, but this was an irregular solid object.  He was in the public baths in Syracuse when it dawned on him that the volume of an object would displace an equal volume of water.  He ran from the bathhouse yelling, &quot;Eureka, I've got it!&quot;  He simply forgot to put his clothes back on.  The king was right to be suspicious, by the way.<br />Had it not been for his intelligence, sound judgement, and wisdom he would not be credited with the discovery.  This is the theme throughout the book.  &quot;Accidents become discoveries because of the sagacity of the person who encountered the accident.&quot;<br />For students or trivia champions knowing the background, especially the accidental and humorous beginnings of something, makes remembering who discovered what and why easier.  The bonus is that you get a few good chuckles too.  Five stars for the discoverers.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-09-03

The philosophy, however, is ancient and respected Chinese Art.  Although it takes years to master Feng Shui, this little red book is filled with tips that are easy for any beginner, such as I am, to create a more peaceful and energetic environment.<br />Not all of the tips answer the question &quot;why,&quot; but some do.  I think this is part of the philosophy, for how can anyone explain art or trust? There are many topics covered in this book, including sustenance, light and reflection, water, color and scent, nature, and more.<br />These are some of the tips.  (1) Goldfish represent wealth and fertility and should never be placed in the kitchen or bedroom.  (2) Get rid of the clutter because &quot;hoarding creates stale energy.&quot;  (3) Sharp corners and angles in your furniture create a disruptive flow, while rounded objects create harmony.  (4) Cool colors create passive energy while warm tones are energetic and passionate.

If I could give the exciting word adventure that I found in this book, I would give it to everyone I know; not everyone would appreciate it, but the thought counts.<br />There are only 1000 words, but those words can be the canvas for your word pictures.  I find myself thinking about the stories that Scheherazade told every night for 1000 nights; the stories that saved her life.  Perhaps that is where the use of 1000 was derived.<br />The book has sufficient white space and is in a font that does not disappear unless you have a magnifying glass to make it easy to read.  The main index is in English, and under each word is the corresponding entry in each of the twenty-six languages; these lists are the only definitions.  The languages are: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, Finnish, Turkish, Indonesian, Swahili, and Esperanto plus the six which are transliterated from Russian, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Yiddish and Japanese into Roman spelling; these include the original script as well.<br />Many programs and on-line searches will give you other languages for whatever word or phrase you want.  However, how many will strike a creative urge?  Words such as svila (Serbo-Croation), seiyem (Hungarian), kinu (Japanese), silk (English) can take your imagination into new worlds.<br />To me, nothing is quite as good as a hardback with a worn cover, the smell of dust, and yellowed pages accumulated from years of usage.

The premise for the book is chilling and realistic, particularly with the amazing developments in the science of DNA mapping, cloning, and stem cell creations.  The cover art is masterful.  The name of the island (which actually is in the Chesapeake Bay) seems to be a complex synopsis of the premise (as in worthy blood).  Bloodsworth Island is owned by the federal government, which suits the intrigue and plausible terrorism in the scenario.<br />Dr. Marcus Gallagher could easily pass for the charismatic Jim Jones or the youthful Adolf Hitler.  He has established a bio-research facility with the goal of eradicating those that he has judged to be genetically inferior humans.  He exerts cult-like control and indoctrination over all of his employees, but the devotion of highly educated scientists is not realistic.<br />The hero is Gene Nolan, a research physician who lost his residency and could never get another job until this golden apple was offered to him.  I immediately thought that Dr. Gallagher had arranged this before the story begins.  Being jobless and unemployable is what Dr. Gallagher holds over him, but it is not a strong enough reason to support the loss of individuality that is required.  There are no ex-employees, except in graves.<br />The writing is disjointed and hard to follow, almost as if too much information was edited out in trying to create a more mysterious environment.  &quot;...The clandestine practice of medicine...&quot; is a clue to the intrigue with the overtones of &quot;black arts&quot; or witchcraft and wizards, which does fit the story.<br />These are good ideas that need further development.

However, it is real, and salvation has found him one more time.  It is with joy and a sense of newly found wealth that he, his wife Wendy, and their small son Danny become the caretakers of the spectacular Overlook Hotel in the magnificent Rocky Mountains near Telluride, Colorado.<br />Their love is renewed as they gaze upon their castle, which shimmers with unnatural splendor in the snowy crystals.  Wendy goes about making the hotel a home, and Danny discovers secrets and learns how to write backwards.  There is a garden maze in true Victorian style that enchants the guests with the animal topiary jungle that lives within the changing labyrinth.  There is a surprise around every corner as the animals shift shapes before your eyes.  Dare to enter, and let your imaginations run free; just remember the way out.<br />The first snowfall brings a crystal enchantment, and the departure of the final guests.  The family will live the winter months together, but not in a one-room dingy city apartment.  Jack writes immortal words of a soon to be American classic.  &quot;Here's Johnny,&quot; gains new meaning as he makes his point with pen, typewriter, and axe.<br />Adventures stimulate your senses while preying on your mind.

She addressed the main issue of work force and salary in this highly praised dissertation about successful businesses and creating employees.<br />The work ethics Shelley defined are still in vogue.  She established the law that career comes before impact analysis, scientific experimentation, and love.  Most technicians still follow the advice published in 1818 by working day and night to put together the right solution for their clients regardless of the work environment.<br />Shelley points out that product based solutions fail while standards and protocols create the framework for a universal solution.  Scientists embraced the philosophy to create simply because they could.  Penicillin and the atomic bomb were born from the advancement of science.  With the creation of stem cells, we see that Shelley's work has been implemented and that Doctor Frankenstein does indeed live.<br />However, Shelley does not just address the issue of increasing the work force, but how to manage relationships as the jobs get more stressful.  Donn Gash, editor of Deviant Minds, in his excellent analysis of the true impact Shelley sees regarding the ultimate options for love states: &quot;... what red-blooded heterosexual man would ignore his beautiful fianc&eacute;e in favor of creating another man?&quot;<br />There you have it.  Work comes first.  Before you start your next dot.com business -- read this book.  Find out how you too can increase your team and create a winning strategy.

Be prepared to laugh and ride the humorous wave with Sterling Johnson.<br />In the 1970's, George Carlin cited seven words that would never appear on TV, but time and theatrical productions have changed their acceptability.  Unfortunately, I cannot list them in this review because they would not be suitable, but they are listed on page 8 of this book.<br />Cable TV followed the lead when they began showing these R+ rated movies.  Language that was not conventional when Carlin clarified what the &quot;bad&quot; words were is now common in conversations.<br />His and Hers, Hands on experience, Tips and Traps are just a few of the sections that provide alternate words for different body parts and actions.  Throughout the book, Johnson gives examples through dialogue.  The goal is to help the newcomer with a way to understand what f*ck and other derivatives mean, and which ones are fighting words.<br />Writers will find this book is a clear definition of how to write true to life dialogue for today's market.<br />I was expecting a different outlook than definitions of &quot;bad&quot; words, so I was somewhat disappointed.  However, this is a valuable resource that is well written and funny.<br />Victoria Tarrani	2001-07-13

I was expecting a thesaurus of  Old West words and phrases.  It was a treat to discover that this book is far more.  It came into being because Scott Thybony worked through writer's blocks by collecting words.<br />What a surprise to discover in the Introduction that Gustave Flaubert (of Madame Bovary fame) would sit for long periods of time, head braced in his hands, as he mentally searched for the perfect word to begin his stories.  \\"It can happen to the most careful writers -- especially the careful ones.\\"  Knowing that writer's blocks happens to all writers does not make it any easier when facing a blank paper wall.<br />Wrapping up the Introduction Thybony writes, \\"...but remember Flaubert.  He demanded a perfect fit for something inherently loose-jointed.\\"<br />Then you get to the meat of the word feast.<br />  Thybony is a very accomplished, easy to read author.  He overcame blocks as he \\"...paid attention to the color and texture of language.\\"  Whenever he interviewed someone, he listened for the words that grounded the location to the scene or \\"threw sparks\\" that brought the American West to life.  The words are section headers with the shades of meanings listed below making it easy to find what you are looking for.  However, this book is not a compendium of disconnected words.  There are beautiful etchings within each of the sections: Land, Sky, Water, Fire, Life, Seasons, and People that give you the feeling of history and poetry.<br />I am including a few quotations from Scott Thybony's book to show the poetic prose and sound advice: \\"...the blank page in front of me wasn't due to a lack of vocabulary but a loss of motion.\\"  Always expand the horizon and possibility of your words because \\"language needs room to breathe, and it has plenty of it here.\\"  My favorite: \\"Also, the nature of writing tends to encourage cannibalism.  Writers consume the words of their own kind and sometimes swallow them without chewing.\\"<br />This is a wonderful book.  Start anywhere and read for a few minutes; it is funny, charming, educational, and inspirational.  It is a 92 page treasure and worth every single star.nywhere and read for a few minutes; it is funny, charming, educational, and inspirational.

Research is one of the most important elements of great writing.  Verifiable details not only carry the story forward, but also teach and allow the readers to trust the writer, so they are able to suspend disbelief.  Unfortunately, the reviews of this book are dry and do not show the potential of completely describing the anatomical structure of the human body.<br />Is there a doctor or nurse in your story?<br />The renderings of cadavers show the entire system of nerves, muscles, tendons, veins, arteries, etc.  Therefore, if your character is hiking, falls, and breaks a bone you can be very specific about the break and how it affects the surrounding tissue.  Was the bone an ulna or a fibula?  The first is a broken arm, and it is possible that both major bones (second is radius) are broken.  If repelling down a cliff wall in order to get away from a pack of wolves is part of the story, how will s/he do it?  What muscles and tendons are affected by the break?  The second is a leg bone between the knee and ankle; if this and the femur are broken, do the bones protrude through the skin?  Can s/he stand, walk, or crawl?<br />What I specifically like about this book is the ability to describe the details surrounding any body part because I can see it.  The diagrams are clearly labeled in each of the sections, which are the Trunk --Body Wall and Spine, Thorax, Abdomen, Pelvis and Perineum, Lower Limb, Upper Limb, Head and Neck, and Cranial and Autonomic Nerves.<br />Remember, if the digastric is inflamed, the culprit could be a rusty nail that caused lockjaw because there is no vaccine available.

My guess is there has been excessive experience with these personas.  If you can ignore the sarcasm, then this is an excellent resource.  Although this self-help book was written for women, the characteristics that create a nightmare relationship are found in both genders.<br />The book shows the quirks and traits of difficult individuals, and describes the &quot;red flags&quot; of people to avoid.  Addressing &quot;why&quot; Mr./Ms Wrong was chosen and how to help overcome the relationship are part of the formulas within &quot;Avoiding Mr. Wrong.&quot;  Many of these traits co-exist in the same person.  Additionally, there are suggestions for Mr./Ms Wrong to change.<br />For the writers, this information helps in creating believable characters that take over the story and create the plots.<br />1. Detached (D): The detached spouse finds intimacy a difficult chore.  To avoid emotional involvement this person may be a workaholic who leaves home before sunrise and comes home long after it has set.  Or while home stays in the &quot;other room,&quot; and is engrossed in a PC, books, movies, sports, music, etc., anything to add distance.<br />2. The control freak (CF): Prince Charming or a Dominatrix is the one who manages people and events.  At first, the strong support may be alluring, but to keep control this personality must rule with an iron fist.  Oddly enough, this pattern's root cause is fear, and the result is to create fear in the partner.<br />3. Mr. or Ms Wonderful (W): When someone is too good to be true, pay attention; this person goes to extremes.  No rules apply to W; Wonderful is a treat, knows it, and expects to be in the spotlight constantly.  No one else has any success worth talking about for longer than it takes to return the conversation to W.<br />4. The cowardly lion (CL): With a great deal of honesty and courage, Stephen Arterburn states that he relates to this persona.  (1) CL gives in to peer pressure,  (2) takes the easy way out (although the price is steeper as time goes by), (3) stays in failing relationships rather than leave, and more.  Everyone experiences cowardice, but CL lives with the terrible knowledge of being cowardly.<br />5. The angry man (AM): This person will become violent.  Having recently met an AM, I am amazed that the eighteen red flags are so accurate.  Some of the traits are (1) jealous, (2) insecure, (3) possessive of the trophy mate and (4) reattaches quickly if there is a break-up, (5) blames others, (6) views sex as the answer to any issue, (7) threatens to harm you or your loved ones, and more.  The book is worth the price for this bit of information alone.<br />6. The mama's boy (MB): Still living at home, MB appears to be perfect because of his or her devotion and caring for Mother or Father. There is only one person that can have priority in MB's life -- his mama or her papa.<br />  7. The deceiver (TD): Hoping for truth, yet living the lie this relationship has little chance of success.  When truth is relative, or what s/he does not know will not hurt, then truth changes from day to day or hour to hour.  Loyalty, fidelity, and commitment become concepts that do not exist.<br />8. The addict (A): The life of the party is fun to be around, but can end up costing peace of mind and every asset that has been accrued.<br />9. The eternal kid (EK): Peter Pan, the eccentric genius, or Gilligan all have charm that beguiles while the personality begs to be taken care of.  Someone has to be the adult -- so why not you?  Wendy grows up; Peter takes no responsibility.<br />10. The ungodly man (UM): With no concept of spirituality, desperation rules UM.  While claiming to have no faith in God's existence, UM blames God for the &quot;bad things&quot; that happen in the world.  In addition, it is imperative to UM that he is right and believers are wrong.<br />This is a book packed with information about, and tips on how to avoid, getting involved with a person who can ultimately ruin your life.  (5 stars)  However, the heavy dose of sarcasm and anger take away the &quot;page turner&quot; aspect.

From the moment, I read the first two paragraphs of Shadows Fall I was hooked.  What I had anticipated from a genre of a romantic mystery was a gentle heroine who discovered the object of her affection had a mysterious background.  To find Beth Gray, the heroine, standing over a dead body with a loaded gun in her hand was shocking.<br />Fifteen years later Beth and her own daughter Abby are back.  The thriller begins after Beth, who was convicted for murder and then released early, returns to her family estate &quot;The Wilder Mountain Lodge&quot; which is located on the west slope of Shadow Lake in California.  The property value could be a clue to the identity of the real murderer.<br />Fourteen-year-old Ollie was involved with Beth's sister Vicky.  At thirteen Vicky was enchanted by the handsome boy, and refused to forgive her sister.  Her brother Matt, though he loved Beth dearly, testified against his sister at the trial.  The traumatic events created an emotional dilemma for the young man.<br />Her romantic interest is introduced so casually in Chapter One that readers may not notice the connection between the two.  It is ethereal, but perfect because we have all experienced that &quot;there is something about her/him that I can't explain&quot; feeling.<br />I will not provide a list of suspects and motives.  Rest assured that there are a plethora of clues (and some red herrings) that will keep you turning pages.  In many ways, this book reminded me of Agatha Christie's &quot;Ten Little Indians.&quot;  There are only a limited number of people who could have killed Ollie.  In self-protection, the killer will strike again.  Beth, Abby, and everyone she knows is in danger or dangerous.<br />Although there are a few clich&eacute; descriptions in Shadows Fall they do not detract from the plot, characters, surprises, and puzzle.  This is a crime solver's delight; a romance that touches our hearts.  This, most likely, will become a movie in which Winona Rider would be the perfect Beth.<br />If you start reading at dawn, suddenly it will be time to turn on some lights.  The excuse will be that it is getting too dark to read.  Too dark to be in the house with a killer -- the characters are so real that you know they are there with you.<br />Do not just wait for the movie -- let your heart race with this 5 star book that should become a New York Times Best Seller.<br />Victoria Tarranid be the perfect Beth.  <br />If you start reading at dawn, suddenly it will be time to turn on some lights.

The US Marine force acknowledges that without the members of this tribe the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima and other crucial locations.<br />The Navajo-English Dictionary was designed to aid Navajos learning English, those desiring to learn Navajo, and to help preserve this rich language.  Without &quot;The Sound System of Navajo&quot; section in which Wall and Morgan teach about the pronunciation of the words this dictionary would serve as a research tool, but would not provide a way to correctly speak any of the over 9,000 entries.<br />The dictionary is formatted strictly with the Navajo words then the English definitions.  If you wanted to find the perfect English word, then translate it into Navajo, you will have to search through the book.  There are two columns of definitions per page.  The Navajo is in bold, and I did not find it difficult to link the words together.<br />Writers:<br />The book will help create veracity whether your story is set in the old west, any world war, or current conflicts.

I read it, but found it difficult because it is filled with hand written pages in wildly colored text and includes line drawings that seemingly have no connection to the text.  Yet there is magic in this book and style, and in reading it again, I see why the format is important.  Sark reveals herself, without fear or shame, much as a child simply tells the truth or writes letters and numbers with a crayon.<br />There are many topics in this self-help book, so I will only tell a little about a few of them.  What I have discovered is that I have implemented more than I realized in the years since I first read this book.<br />Go out Wildly and Alone.  Sark wrote, &quot;My mother taught me not to wait for a man to buy me flowers.  She always said, 'Buy your own flowers, too.' ... and I do.&quot;  This bit of advice also covers buying something for ourselves simply because we like it.  I splurged on some new knit shirts to wear with my jeans -- because I wanted them and I loved the colors.<br />Old, Alone, and Succulent in Sark's words:  &quot;We are studying now to be the old women we will be.&quot;  Getting older is a trick of fate, but being succulent is putting up pink towels because you want them; dancing in the rain (sans clothing) - well that's my idea of succulence; not fearing to throw your head back and laugh.  Tonight I walked down to the park so I could swing.<br />Faces of Intimacy:  &quot;Nobody tells us as little girls that we may fall in love and have moments of hating our beloved...&quot; We build many walls in our goals of self-protection, but ultimately the walls create isolation.  Break the walls down.  Start simple -- for years I have walked up to strangers to tell them that I like their earrings or shirt or tie.  It is not true intimacy, but it is a small opening.<br />Erotic Robot is a woman in search of herself.  This woman has sexual encounters because (1) it is easier than saying no, (2) she is fulfilling someone's fantasies at the expense of her own, (3) to be polite, (4) get it over with so the man would just leave, (5) to make money fast... and many more reasons.

What is war?  Is it waged on battlefields with strafing air strikes, or is it personal and economical achievements?<br />On the opening page Gary Gagliardi reveals a provocative view of war:  &quot;Whether you are a new graduate looking for a job or a business owner building a company, *The Art of War* will give you greater insight into achieving success in a competitive world.  For over 2500 years, winners have profited from the ideas of Sun Tsu on how to avoid defeat and embrace victory.&quot;  Gagliardi used these principles to build his own software organization that became a Fortune 500 private company and a very successful business that he sold.  He knows what he is talking about.<br />Sun Tsu's Chinese symbols have been translated many times over the centuries.  Each document is slightly different and may actually disagree with other version.  I own two translations and have discovered the bane of all scholars -- the more you learn the more you realize you do not know.<br />The power of this adaptation is due to the meticulous work of Gagliardi's research.  The translation for each character is printed on the left page, the English construction of the sentences are on the right.  The delicate Chinese symbols are works of art that show nuances of each character are altered even by the slight difference in the angle of a line.<br />I will show the comparison of Chinese to English words and phrases from the section on Planning.  I am not able to show the Chinese characters, but the punctuation between the thoughts is due to the grouping of the characters.  Gagliardi provides a guide to increased understanding of the Chinese phraseology.<br />Chinese:<br />Make experience by five skills,<br />Learn it by planning,  And yet demand this situation,<br />*  Say philosophy,<br />*  Say heaven,<br />*  Say ground,<br />*  Say general,<br />*  Say methods.<br />English:<br />Your skill comes from the five factors.

This version contains over 10,500 Apache / English word and over 4,400 dialect versions.<br />For me the Western Apache-English Dictionary is much more.  I was born on the White Mountain Apache Reservation when the Apaches allowed peoples other than the Mountain Tribe to live there.  My inability to live in the small town where I was born is reasonable -- it is due to combating simple attrition that has caused many native cultures to merge into others and disappear.<br />However, my heart and soul are linked to the blood of the land.  When I discovered this book, which was compiled by Editor Dorothy Bray in collaboration with the White Mountain Apache Tribe, I felt as if I had found the manna in the desert.<br />Not only does this book contain the cross-reference between English and Apache words, it has the grammar, verb construction, changes in writing conventions, the Apache alphabet, and how to pronounce the words using the unique Apache marks.<br />The book format has sufficient white space to make it easy to associate the words, and to study the grammar rules.  After these rules are meticulously detailed the next section is the Apache word translated to the English equivalent; the second is reversed.  All of this care makes it easier to research or enhance linguistic skills.<br />For the Writer:<br />Most writers love dictionaries, reference books, and the etymology of words.  Why would a writer want one more dictionary?<br />One answer is that we writers can &quot;only cure&quot; our addictions to books, words, and diverse languages by getting every book in the universe -- it is a long, constant quest.  However, we do this to increase the veracity of researched details within the plot that allows readers to suspend disbelief making the story more than entertaining.<br />My word processor will not place the correct markings in the Apache words, but I will provide a few of the Apache words and English associations.  If you intend to write a story set in Fort Apache or the surrounding area then you should purchase this book for reference.  These genres include: S/F time travel, histories of the old West, historical romances, fantasies such as &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Author's Court&quot; except the hero finds he is facing Geronimo.<br />  This section includes some of the words; please note the slashes between meanings because they indicate different dialects:<br />Five examples of case changes:<br />*  iich'igo'aahi -- a teacher or he is teaching<br />*  iich'igon'aa -- he taught<br />*  iich'igon'aah -- you teach or you have taught  *  iich'igot'aah -- he will be taught<br />*  iicg'igot'aahgo na'godi'i -- parable / story that teaches<br />Similar in meaning:<br />*  kude -- here<br />*  ku'de -- right here<br />*  kud&eacute;' -- from here<br />*  ku'dahyu' -- up here<br />*  kude'yogo -- if it were here<br />English to Apache:<br />*  evil --  ch'lin biyi' golinthi<br />*  do evil or witchcraft -- da'ohni'  or  da'oi'di'<br />This five star book is rich and rewarding.<br />Victoria Tarranit is a long, constant quest.

Throughout the history of the world, we see the powerful subjugating the weak.  To combat this, the Koga Ninja, who were the poor farmers and could be put to death for owning any kind of weaponry, became the black clad secretive, silent Ninja.  These warriors learned to create weapons from whatever material was available -- wherever they were; often hiding them in many different stashes around the farms.<br />Their weapons had to be inexpensive, easy to make, and disposable if the need arose.  This is one of the most important factors in the weapon designs from the Koga Ninja.  Why?  &quot;Concern for losing a weapon might cause one to hesitate, and at that moment of hesitation might cost the Ninja his or her life.&quot;  (Toshitora Yamashiro, Forward to &quot;Secret Guide to Making Ninja Weapons.&quot;)<br />All weapons are extremely dangerous.  The black and white photographs of Ninjas holding the weapons, and of these lethal tools, show how to carry, defend, or attack with them.  These weapons have the ability to maim or kill the Ninja warrior who is practicing if they are used incorrectly.<br />It is imperative for a Ninjutsu to study under a master.  Do not take the patterns and create weapons that you do not have the skills or knowledge to use.  The Master teaches how to use each weapon, and the concentration, dedication, and spiritual growth required for a true Ninja.<br />I cannot stress the need for training enough.<br />....  The photographs of Ninja, information about the various weapons, the metallurgy, searching junkyards for components, and the patterns and directions to make them are the details that add veracity to fiction, fantasy, and history books; they allow the reader to suspend disbelief and trust the writer.<br />Why would a warrior choose a To or Tanto instead of a Yari?<br />The To, approximately thirty-six inches long, is a sword.  It is the weapon that no Koga Ninja would be without; this means if a Ninja had to abandon the To in the process of completing a mission and escape, it would be the first weapon that was created when he or she had found safety.<br />The Tanto is the assassin's dagger.  This sharp blade was designed to penetrate armor and is often painted for camouflage, as are many of the other weapons.  Directions include how to make a scabbard for the To and Tanto.  The Yari is a spear that is used as a thrusting weapon.  The spearhaft is generally five feet long, but can be as long as twenty feet, which would require both strength and skill to manipulate.  In movies we see martial arts experts grabbing poles for defensive/aggressive maneuvers -- this is a lot more deadly.<br />The next weapons are of the Kusari class.  Though they all begin with a length of chain, the Kusari Fundo (Manrikgusari) is the simplest weapon to make.  The Kusari Gama requires a sickle while the Shoge adds a spiked blade.  The Nunchaku adds two metal rods and uses a shorter chain.<br />Blow guns, Tetsu-Bishi (flat four pointed star) and Shuriken (several star weapons the fit together like a puzzle to form a deadly ball) are described in detail.  These are often shown in movies.  The perfect Ninja throws the Tetsu-Bishi with the ease that most of us think about when skipping stones across a lake -- though I've only achieved that feat a few times.<br />I will never make a weapon.  I do not practice Ninjutsu, but the heroes and heroines in my stories, particularly the S/F trilogy I am writing, do.  Writing with detailed information is imperative.

The many photographs and drawings add to the scenes, but it is his articulate writing style that reveals an excellent writer sharing the world he knows.  Robinson is a pseudonym for a man who served with the British Army and in overseas forces.<br />For the writers:<br />If battles are part of your story whether modern, fantasy, science fiction, history, war, romance, every genre, then seeing real heroes in action adds to your knowledge base and will make your warriors and their fights believable.<br />Suppose a highly trained SAS agent who is caught by time finds himself in the midst of the &quot;French and Indian War&quot; or &quot;The War of the Roses.&quot;  Imagine the great advantage for the &quot;Redcoats&quot; if a team of specialists happened to cross the Bermuda Triangle and find themselves in the midst of American war for Independence.  There is no limitation for imagination.<br />As I read this book, I felt as if I were a miner plucking nuggets with every shifting of the sand.  I hit the golden mother lode.  Though I had purchased this book as a reference for my own creativity I found myself absorbed and involved -- Mike Robinson has crafted a masterpiece.<br />The book:<br />The SAS was formed in Africa over 50 years ago.  The Regiment still wins most of their confrontations.  Why?  To become a member a man must overcome a wide range of training that includes physical, mental, weapon, equipment, paratrooping, medical, analysis, and more.  The consistent training means that every member knows what to expect from others, and they build on a bond of absolute trust within each four-man Sabre Squadron.<br />Robinson's dedication in the Preface is a profound statement of his respect for these heroes: &quot;For the cornerstone of their success has always been, and will always be, the individual SAS soldiers themselves.  It is they who win, because they dare, often against impossible odds and at the cost of their lives.  To these men this book is dedicated.&quot;<br />Overviews of the chapters:<br />* Joining the SAS -- volunteers must pass challenges that include navigation by compass and distance in areas that do not provide visible landmarks; jungles, deserts, mountains, or any place where weather has limited the visibility.  Additionally, to become a member of the SAS each man must endure exhaustion and pain in their effort to reach the next rendezvous.<br />* Weapons Skills -- beginning with a day in 1972 when 250 guerrillas attacked nine SAS soldiers who, with a few local gendarmes and tribesmen, defeated the attackers this book documents weapons, skills, and uses including: snipers, battles, armament, intrusion defensive positions, and more.<br />* Explosives and Sabotage -- with knowledge and training SAS four-man patrol can cause damage that brings aggressive enemies to a stop.<br />* Counter-Terrorist Tactics -- terrorists are analyzed and a group of no more than 50 full-time soldiers are on call to defend and defeat terrorism tactics.  This section includes descriptions of a warfare kit, dress, weapons, and exercises in the &quot;Killing House.&quot;<br />* Fighting as a Four-man Team -- each regiment consists of four four-men troop specialists: medic, communications, linguist, and demolitions expert; also each man has at least one specific patrol skill. As their experiences with the SAS increases, so does the variety of these skills.<br />* Silent Killing Skills -- to survive when behind enemy lines each member is trained to kill without being seen.  Various tools and methods are described.<br />* Medical Expertise -- trained to use what is available in the locale and in a med pack, these men help their comrades and friendly causalities.<br />* Civil Disorder Control -- in the midst of civil unrest extremists often usethe turmoil to further their own ends.  The Regiment have skills to &quot;surgically remove&quot; the subversives.<br />* Observing the Enemy -- camouflage and concealment skills allow a patrol to move into &quot;hot spots&quot; and strategize for victory.<br />* Signals and Radio Skills -- all soldiers are trained in the art of using communication equipment, hand and body signals, and Morse code.<br />* Behind Enemy Lines -- this includes destroying enemy communications, rescue missions, and survival.<br />* Staying Hidden -- trained to remain hidden even in the most boring or difficult conditions is the difference between success and failure.  The SAS has embraces Risk.<br />* Operating in Hostile Regions -- SAS troops work and battle in the freezing arctic, hot humid jungles, barren desert sands, islands or on the ocean.<br />* Specialist Insertion Methods -- heavy transport aircraft, parachuting from high or low altitudes, helicopters where troops rappel down from the fuselage, canoes and other water flotation devices and stealth are only part of the skills used to reach the mission location.<br />* Booby Traps -- these devices are designed to maim rather than kill, and defeat the enemy's morale.

What is a fish-burner since it has nothing to do with fish?<br />This book is perfect for writers who want a to reveal the old west as accurately as possible including anachronistic terminology that help set the scene.  Among the authors of Western Fiction, based in truth, are Zane Gray, Larry McMurtry, and Louis L'Amour. Their books are popular because they are realistic and do not throw in a modern term that would destroy the time setting.<br />Time travel novels for the SF/F genre, historical romance, history, mystery, and discovery writers benefit from this great dictionary as well.<br />Today a zephyr is most commonly thought of as a gentle breeze, but in the 1860's the Washoe zephyr was a strong west wind blowing through the Truckee River Valley during the Spring and the Fall.  Not only is the time frame provided, but also the specific location.  Washoe was an Indian tribe that inhabited the area that has now become known as Reno, Nevada..  The famous Comstock Lode at nearby Virginia City during the 1850's created many terms that are now obsolete.  The Washoe canary was the nickname for a burro.<br />Camisa is a beautiful word, a great name for a heroine.  However, it is a Spanish based word used in 1830 to describe a loose blousy shirt or chemise.<br />What is a hydrophobia skunk?  The psychological etymology would be a skunk has an abnormal fear of water.  In the Southwest of 1910 it was the term that was used to describe a skunk whose bite caused madness; rabies were common to many pests and rodents in the region.<br />The water dog is not canine.  It is the Western name for any variety of salamander that was most commonly used as fish bait for Bass.  The time frame was about 1850.<br />A fish-burner (also spelled fish burner) is an Alaskan term for a sled dog, especially one that is used in competitive sled rides.  A hayburner, on the other hand, is a jocular term for a horse.<br />  The design of the book places the words in a left column, the meaning are in the right.  It has sufficient white space to make it easy to match the word with the meaning.  Photographs are connected to the some of words for descriptive purposes.  One of the most effective aspect of the book is to provide dates, areas, language base (e.g., Spanish, Alaskan, Latin, Chinook, etc.), and some history for each word.<br />Anyone interested in the old west will find the book fascinating; writers will find a wonderful tool that help create the stories of the American West.<br />Without a doubt this is a 5 star delight.meaning are in the right.

Information is manna for a writer.  It stimulates creativity that becomes part of stories, books, essays, articles, photojournalism, journalism, etc.  For any writer of action stories, knowing the secrets of good battle training is imperative whether the book is a futuristic science fiction novel or one set in the dark ages.<br />Andy McNab is one of the soldiers in &quot;The Regiment,&quot; Britian's covert SAS (Special Air Service) team.  This is his autobiography.  He was an undisciplined teenager with no goals who became a member of this elite group.  He holds nothing back as he chronicles nine years of covert operations on five continents.  McNab's language in this book is rough, but refreshing; you feel as if you are in The Regiment, but grateful that you did not have to go through the training.  It is not easy to become a member of this group; many give up and never try again -- but Andy did.  In my opinion, taking the second chance speaks highly of courage.<br />This book has given me a higher respect for Navy SEALS, NATO SAS, The Regiment, and everyone who protects the law and the innocent.  It is part of their training to learn judgement -- and that is imperative when you are holding a weapon.  I have a friend who is in SAS; after reading, this book I am simply in awe of his challenges.<br />Photographs are included in Immediate Action.  The black and white snapshots state much about the author and his journey through his assignments.<br />What tips help writers in this book:<br />HALO or High Altitude Low Opening is a method of intrusion into a zone.  Any person that jumps from a plane that is flying over 10,000 feet from the ground must have oxygen until they reach the relative safety of this altitude in the drop.  By riding a parachute from that height the plane is not generally considered a threat by the target -- but the troops are vulnerable when the reach firing range.  What happens when a member lands in the ocean?  How about a tree (accidents do happen and can cause death)?  What if the oxygen tank fails?  How does a squadron stay nourished and keep from boredom in the midst of a stakeout?<br />What is a &quot;can?&quot;  It is a slang term for a tank.  Using slang words in dialogue create a realistic and plausible scene.<br />Do you know what a &quot;G3 with collapsible stock is?&quot;  I certainly had no idea that it is an automatic similar to an AK47.  How about a kukri -- one wicked machete.<br />These questions become part of scene just as having the correct terminology shows that you know what you are writing -- it is safe to suspend disbelief.  Adding details enhances the reading experience, and adds veracity to your plot, characters, action, and story.<br />This book opens amazing doors.  The truth (as far as I know) is not diluted.

I have read other reviews of this book and discovered that advanced survivalists do not think as highly of this book as beginners.  This review is based on using the book as a tool -- a writer's tool.<br />Researching means that I read a variety of books.  Though I may never be able to apply the information in my real life, it is necessary for writing.  However, that is not the case in this book; the tips and tricks are valuable and informative.<br />Quenching thirst: The high bush cranberry is different from the vine variety.  The fruit of both is tart and can be bitter, but the high bush cranberry has a provocative flavor that remains.  It takes time to adjust to the flavor, but the juice of a handful of berries quenches thirst &quot;like no other wild berry I know.&quot;<br />Rabbit starvation: Eating lean meat can be a significant problem -- whether you are in the wild or existing on low fat meals at home.  A diet that lacks fat is dangerous and can cause severe digestive problems.  The out of balance system will crave food, but the food (if eating lean meat only) will escalate the digestive system problems.  I applied this to my own diet and realized that I needed to eat more pizza to compensate for the quantity of low fat foods.<br />What wild creature is the most dangerous?  Many animals have become accustomed to humans and will move toward rather than away from the curious two legged beings invading their space.  Wolves and bears and wild cats -- oh my.  No, insects are the real danger.  Mosquitoes, bees, and black flies in large swarms can kill a healthy man who does not know how to protect himself.  Good information -- better information is that there are ways to find shelter and be safe from the swarms. . . right here in this book.<br />In writing a story the tips within this book enhance creative imagination.

Like a box full of chocolates with a surprise in every wrapper, this book is filled with delights.<br />The Reverse Dictionary is one of my favorite books, the place where I can always find the right word.  Not only are words defined as they are in a standard dictionary, but this dictionary provides alternatives with their meanings as it relates to the selected word:<br />This is an example from the book:<br />deceive -- See also cheat<br />- deceive, pretending to be something or someone that is not -- masquerade, dissemble<br />- deceive or flatter with smooth charming talk-- blarney<br />- easily deceived, fooled, or duped -- credulous, gullible<br />The next entries in the Reverse Dictionary are for deception, then deceptive which give you additional routs to finding perfection.<br />In addition to the thesaurus quality of the book, there are charts, maps, and pictures.  By using the quick table for German terms I discover that the meaning of Junker is &quot;a former Prussian aristocrat.&quot;  Also if you have wondered what the mathematical symbols or therapy (rolfing) terms mean the answer is in this book.  One of the most interesting charts is a tree diagram of the Indo-European Languages.<br />Providing multiple variations of the same word and additional thesaurus options makes this book an excellent choice.  When coupled with the many graphics and tables it is easy to see that this tool is for students, writers, teachers, lecturers, and everyone else.<br />This is such an interesting book that it is difficult to classify it as a reference tool..

Rock, Paper, Scissors is one of those rare books by a first time author that takes the reader on a thrill ride.  The book is not filled with similes and metaphors, one of my personal pet peeves; instead the writing is clean, distinct, and clear.  Authors to whom I compare the writing are David Balducci (Absolute Power), Tom Clancy (The Hunt for Red October), and John Grisham (A Time to Kill).<br />It is a cold winter's afternoon...and I was hooked in the prologue.<br />A three-year-old child sees her father murdered while he is pushing her in a swing.  Having been strapped into the swing for safety, she is left to dangle long past midnight.  Why did the ruthless assassin not kill the only witness to his crime?  She was not part of the contract.  However, children become adults and traumatic scenes such as this are part of their character.  Steve Samuel's character development is perfect; Sarah Peterson is smart, talented, observant, and uses her skills as if they were a sixth sense.  She is able to see the danger in various situations, which catapults her to the top in the FBI, and ultimately face to face with her father's killer.<br />Along the trek, Samuel shows a detailed knowledge of the political inner workings of the FBI, white house staff, and CIA.  His knowledge of world politics is as prescient as Tom Clancy's in the mid-1980's book &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (the Soviet Union was dissolved).<br />Sarah Peterson discovers that corruption and murder are hidden behind both corporate and political doors.  When she learns the secrets behind the kidnapping of a billionaire's daughter the answers bring about the assassinations of some of her FBI associates.  Reluctantly she joins forces with Sam Baldwin (the billionaire) to unravel the plot and find the missing daughter before chaos destabilizes the middle east.  This is the reason behind the crime, and it is frightening and plausible as the logic is revealed in impeccable writing.<br />Enjoy this one -- it is a five star keeper.is a five star keeper.	2001-03-04

Books, music, plays, and movies become classics because they are foundations that inform, entertain, and break new ground (in my opinion). I cannot remember when this book was not recommended for those who needed or wanted to know the elements, the basics of English grammar, including sentence structure and frequently misspelled or misused words.<br />One of the most incorrectly used punctuation marks is the comma.  This small, 85 page book, is an excellent reference for novice or grammarian. Teachers can take the simple exercises and teach their students -- and students can look-up the rules.  Without form and structure, language degenerates. Dictionaries, quickly become out of date, as the next generation adds their own words. That is a reason to keep your dictionary current, by the way.  However the basic structure of English grammar doesn't change simply because it is misunderstood.<br />Please note: there are more commas than necessary in the above paragraph... a reason to read the book is to correct all of the errors I put into that paragraph.<br />This book is now on special order only.  I have a copy somewhere in my garage, but gave up looking for it and bought a new copy. I do not regret one single penny.<br />If you write, or read (or talk) then this book is a must.	2001-02-04

She is not a spelunker, but her injured friend requested that she be on the team to bring them out of the caverns. The rescuers will descend over 800 feet in a short time.<br />This story is rich in details that take Anna across underground cliff faces like Razor Blade Run, through rivers and into the depths of airless passages, where all she wants to see is the sky. The descent must be done in such a way to protect the natural wonders of non-public caverns. On arrival Anna's friend tells her, &quot;It was not an accident.&quot;<br />One of the strong, highly trained companions had murder in the heart. Anna must discover who and why before the killer can strike and succeed. Motives abound among well defined suspects.<br />Nevada Barr convincingly shows why rangers are called to locations other than their assigned park. Her descriptions are so rich that she must have been in the caves.  She is a park ranger herself, and her view of the political structure is as eye-opening as the mystery itself.<br />Ms. Barr is a great storyteller. This is one of her very best novels. She has included enough clues to help the &quot;who done its?&quot; solve the mystery with Anna.	2000-11-13

John Blumenthal turns this story of illness into a very human and funny look at life.  Dorfman is the son of a physician, and he knows all about illnesses. He spends thousands of dollars on tests, owns a personal medical library, but won't to talk to his father about his health.<br />Through flashbacks we learn the family history.  Blumenthal masterfully maintains the shifting timelines throughout his story and easily avoids the confusion of when, where and who is speaking.  During the lively, distinct conversations I never wondered &quot;Who is talking?&quot;  He avoided the overuse of &quot;he said/ she said&quot; by clearly defining people by their words -- I felt as if I were listening to conversations rather than reading them in a book.<br />The story is also about the difficulties in Dorfman's screen writing career, and what it takes to turn a script into a movie.  In the end, Dorfman's writing career is back on-track and he has found an answer for his health.<br />I recommend this book with five stars or 10/10 points; it brought me laughter even through my own difficult personal trials.	2000-11-11

After reading the book I have purchased several more copies as gifts and  had them sent direct from Amazon.  For anyone interested in Native American  culture, shamanism, connecting with and understanding the creatures that  share the Earth with us, this is a &quot;must have&quot; book.  Animals  speak about the events and emotions in our lives.  For a writer the book  brings a wealth of background character information.<br />Have you ever  dreamt about an animal, a panther, a snake, a bear or a hawk?  Did you  wonder why the dream seemed important.  Have you ever glanced out the door  or window to see a spider casually weaving an intricate web or a raccoon or  dog glancing back at you?  What does a totem mean and do the inhabitants of  this modern civilization have personal totems?  Do you have pictures of a  particular animal scattered throughout your house? I have many pictures of  panthers and jaguars in the rooms in which I spend my time because I feel  connected to the jaguar of South American history, especially the Mayans.  Why?<br />My answers were in this book, but even without questions I have  found Animal Speak is loaded with wonderful information about so many  different creatures. Plus, it is a delight to discover what the underlying  emotions may be when someone tells you that they like (or hate) dolphins,  woodpeckers, ants, bees or perhaps a coyote which is actually linked to the  dog.<br />For the mystic the answer is yes we have totems.  The animals  (perhaps pets) in a totem can change as they bring messages that are to  warn, protect, comfort, guide, remind or whatever is needed.	2000-07-07

This book is not just for writers, but for researches or anyone who wants to know the history and meaning behind a name; their own name or that of a child soon to be born.<br />Beginning with The Importance of a Name you  discover ways to make people care about the person simply by choosing a  name.  Next is the importance of Characternyms, or what does the name  impart? One of the examples is Magnum from the Hawaii based TV series  starring Tom Selleck. Magnum is not only a wine bottle that holds twice as  much as a normal liter, but it is also a very powerful bullet. We are  presented with a hero that is &quot;bigger than life&quot; but who also is  effervescent, strong, and brings the ring of sex appeal that champagne,  laughter and a stunning force carry with them. It was a masterful name  selection.<br />There are names by genre, gender, country (including illusive  Native American, Latin, Greek, Russian and more) as well as notes in how to  use the names to create the right impression: for example &quot;...the Norman  invasion in 1066...English were referred to by occupation...Aiken the Miller or  Aisley of York.&quot;<br />Character Naming Source Book is filled with gems  and is far more than a general account about names.  For example Victoria  (my name) is Latin and means triumphant. Feminine derivatives are also  Viktoria (Hungarian-victorious, Swedish-victory) Vittoria (Spanish-victor),  Victrix, Vincentia, Victrixa; in Scottish Vika is &quot;from the  creek&quot; and Torra is &quot;from the castle.&quot; It would appear that  I am a triumphant female from the castle by the creek.  This is only a  small sample of the wealth within these pages.<br />Without doubt this is one  of most complete histories of names that I have ever read, and I have about  five books just on naming.  I recommend this book unequivocally.	2000-07-07

Michael Newton collected interviews with some of his patients about their experiences between lives. Intriguing? You bet!<br />I am a mystic and have had memories of past lives, as have many people. My daughter recommended  Journey of Souls, and in a conversation with her before I had received mine  (her gift), I told her about my immediate past death and what happened  afterwards. She was amazed as she said, &quot;That's right.&quot;  Why? The  first thing I said was that I had died so many times that I knew what had  happened to me. This was a familiar thread in this book because the trauma  of death is exactly that--trauma; however, these interviews show hope and  continuance.<br />My journey through this book was a confirmation of what I  already believed happens right after death and of what the between-world,  the place of souls, is about. So, although there was not a lot of new  information for me in the first third to half of the book, it made me feel  very happy just reading it because the descriptions from others paralleled  my own. There is nothing so rejuvenating as corroboration from a myriad of  strangers.<br />For anyone who wonders if there is life after death, this  answers that question as well as providing insight into soul development  and progression. One of the most interesting aspects were the  &quot;keys&quot; that we memorize so that we will know certain people as  they enter our lives; that feeling of &quot;Gee, I know you,&quot; indeed  is reality.	2000-06-25

Anna Pigeon, Park Ranger, has been called to Northern California's Lassen Volcanic Park to fight a blaze of suspicious origin.  Danger exists in the air she breathes and the exhaustion that takes a toll on all firefighters  that have been brought in to save the park.<br />Nevada Barr convincingly  shows why rangers are called from many locations and the need to work as  one in the midst of a Firestorm. The problem in working as one is that  there is a murderer who has no compunction about covering up the first  death with more.  The most intense scene is when the Firestorm is blasting  down the trail and the only way to survive is as dangerous as the fire  itself.<br />Ms. Barr is a great storyteller who writes what she knows. I  have no doubt that she has experienced survival in various parks and on a  myriad of projects. She brings with her the full power that a writer can  when she has lived the events--perhaps not the murder itself, but survival  in it rawest form.	2000-06-24

Anna Pigeon, is now at home in Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park, but murder also invades the Anasazi ruins.  Why do some of the tourists die while viewing the caves? This becomes a significant question when a child  dies; the previous deaths were attributed to natural circumstance.  The  value of medical training for a park ranger is detailed in giving aid to  these unfortunate visitors.<br />Death continues to visit this land where the  question of &quot;what happened to the Anasazi&quot; is as ingrained to  archaeologists in the real world as it is in the world of Anna Pigeon. It  is clear that Nevada Barr has studied the ancient Native American history  and searched for answers to this question.  Is not a journey into history,  but an adventure into murder and money.<br />Nevada Barr excels in creating  believable characters, situations and solutions.	2000-06-24

Throughout her stories it is evident that she knows the political structure of her business as well as the &quot;landscape&quot; as a ranger.<br />Anna also  finds murderers and solves many types of crimes--this is no  exception.<br />Endangered Species is set in the Cumberland Island National  Seashore park off the Georgia Coast. Lights are not allowed on the coast  when the loggerhead turtles are hatching because the hatchlings will go  toward the light which must take them to the ocean. Protecting the species  is the responsibility of the rangers, and Ms. Barr provides great detail in  the settings as well as scientific reasoning.<br />This is filled with a  variety of adventures and intriguing characters--and they are believable.

As she learns about this cold world, so do we.<br />As Anna  solves the mystery, we feel the fear building because we know that she is  in danger and that she didn't get into that danger by ignoring her common  sense, but by following her basic intelligence to logical conclusions.  Logic can sometimes take too long, which always adds to great suspense.	2000-06-24

There are many  visions threaded throughout several characters, but the problem is that the  story is told by the writer rather than shown by the people who are  experiencing the events. This type of story telling leaves many unanswered  questions and loses the emotional impact of the reader becoming involved  with or caring about the characters or the story.  I had a very difficult  time finishing the book.	2000-06-03

This book is laced with humor and wisdom. Kilian is experienced in  fantasy, hard science fiction, education and children's literature.  He  explores the mythological basis of fantasy novels, explaining the  importance of Greek, Roman, Celtic, Norse, Egyptian--world mythology, as  well as acquiring a strong knowledge of history and philosophies of the  world.  Equally important to success is a fascination with the genre in  which you write.  Gaining the information may seem to be an intimidating  task; it is necessary.<br />Kilian includes exercises to help generate  writing.  I followed these exercises, and wrote with the excitement I had  greatly missed. He also explains each step of the creative process from the  ideas to the finished product with a brief grammar refresher that is easy  to read.  The examples are humorous.  The importance of proper grammar  cannot be overstated if you want your book published.<br />Kilian expresses  a sense of anger, but when tempered by the humor throughout the book, this  becomes righteous indignation directed toward those who try to write in the  genre without the seriousness to make it believable.
