This time, Detective Bosch investigates the one crime that drove him to join the police force: the unsolved murder, in 1961, of his own mother.<br /><br />As the book opens, Bosch has been suspended for attacking his supervisor, Lieutenant Harvey Pounds (who has made appearances in previous Bosch novels) and is required to attend counseling sessions with police psychologist Carmen Hinojos.  Although initially reluctant to bare his feelings, Bosch starts probing the childhood wounds he suffered as the fatherless son of a prostitute, who was forced to spend the bulk of his childhood in McLaren Hall. Despite his ongoing therapy, Bosch engages in a series of self-destructive actions which nearly torpedo his career. As Bosch grapples with painful memories, he methodically solves the case -- and other, related murders, including that of his mother's pimp, Johnny Fox.  In the process, Bosch uncovers early-1960s corruption and comes face to face with detectives, prosecutors and criminals of that era.<br /><br />Once again, Connelly does not disappoint.  The story is well-crafted, with a surprise ending that is unexpected, but makes sense.  As always, the description of Los Angeles -- now and then -- is spot on.  Another fine page-turner!	2005-10-08

In this novel, we return to an incident referenced obliquely in the first two books: Harry Bosch's killing of Norman Church, a murderer known as \\"The Dollmaker.\\"  Bosch had violated police procedure by going to the Dollmaker's apartment alone, and had shot the Dollmaker after incorrectly concluding that he'd been reaching for a gun.  Nonetheless, the LAPD concluded that the Dollmaker had indeed committed eleven brutal murders.  Although makeup from nine of the victims was found in the Dollmaker's possession, Bosch now finds himself a defendant in a federal court civil trial brought by the Dollmaker's wife, where he is accused of having violated the Dollmaker's civil rights.<br /><br />The description of this trial, which weaves throughout the novel, is riveting.  Mrs. Church is represented by a high-profile attorney known for her legal skills and air of righteous indignation.  Bosch is represented by a Deputy City Attorney.  (This novel takes plenty of potshots at the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, with quotes like this: \\"These guys like Bulk, they couldn't make it on the outside .  .  .  If he had to win in order to eat, your lawyer would be a thin man.  He needs that steady paycheck from the city coming in, win or lose.\\")  Nonetheless, Bosch is hopeful that given the ample evidence against the Dollmaker, the jury will enter a defense verdict.<br /><br />But wait -- as the trial begins, another body turns up, murdered the very same way as the other victims.  Known as \\"The Concrete Blonde,\\" she was murdered after Bosch had killed the Dollmaker.  Could Bosch possibly have killed the wrong man?  Or is there a copycat killer about?  If so, can the police find him in time?  Will any of this affect the ongoing trial?  And what will the jury verdict be?<br /><br />This is truly a can't-put-it-down novel that has everything you want: an exciting detective story; a fascinating trial; well-drawn, multi-dimensional characters who defy stereotypes; and Michael Connelly's on-the-money description of the City of Los Angeles and the people who live here. It has just enough plot twists (but not too many) to make the ending completely unpredictable, but believable.  (This is an area where Connelly's previous novels suffered a bit.)<br /><br />While I enjoyed \\"The Black Echo\\" and felt that \\"The Black Ice\\" was an excellent read, \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is by far the best of the lot.

Connelly owns this turf as no mystery writer has since Raymond Chandler: the Hollywood Hills, hugged by houses perched precariously on stilts; the once-respectable, now seedy motels; the dirty streets; the hierarchy of bars, from bleak to bleaker to bleakest; and the empty, soul-less creatures who need one more shot to get through another day.  This is the Los Angeles where Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch tries to piece together a puzzling series of murders, which start as separate crimes but are soon seen to be interrelated.<br /><br />No \\"Joe Friday\\" LAPD booster, Bosch works his cases alone, often contending with the infighting within the LAPD and the rivalry between the LAPD and other agencies.  The bureaucracy itself can be mindboggling.  Bosch is initially assigned to one of these  cases simply to improve his division's \\"cleared\\" statistics.  As Bosch walks through Parker Center (LAPD headquarters), he is acutely aware of the jealously-guarded fiefdoms invisibly dividing each floor.  And his initial meeting with a DEA agent, where each man is holding back information, sadly rings true.<br /><br />The cases themselves, starting with the suicide of a fellow officer and spreading to the deaths of drug dealers and more, take Bosch from Los Angeles to the sister cities of Calexico and Mexicali.  Connelly has clearly done his research, and the descriptions of those cities and the bull-fighting spectacles south of the border are first rate.  Despite being both helped and hampered by the Mexican police, Bosch painstakingly solves the cases.  The last plot twist was a complete surprise to me.<br /><br />This is the second Harry Bosch mystery I've read (I'm reading them in order) and I believe it is even better than Michael Connelly's first, Edgar-winning effort, \\"The Black Echo.\\"  I look forward to reading more works by this engaging author.	2005-09-12

Although the main character is sufficiently developed  and the story will be of interest to those familiar with Philadelphia, the plot itself  -- the cornerstone of any mystery novel -- is fair at best.  The various clues seem contrived.  There are fewer of the clever observations which permeated \\"Mary\\".  Worst of all, the novel lacks the suspense which mystery readers crave: \\"whodunit\\" is reasonably predictable, and for obvious reasons.<br /><br />I am surprised that this novel won an Edgar.  It held my interest, but is nowhere near the novels of, say, Michael Connelly.  It is a nice, quick beach read, but you can find many better novels in this genre.	2005-09-05

This is probably the only series of novels about a female detective in Botswana, or, for that matter, any detective in Botswana.  But Alexander McCall Smith draws on the richness of that beautiful, special country whose air, sky and culture permeate every chapter.  This is a uniquely African story.<br /><br />Yet, Precious Ramotswe also is a darn good detective, drawing on her unique ability to understand human nature to solve a variety of cases.  Although you will not find the depth or convoluted plot of a typical detective novel here, Mma Ramotswe cleverly solves several cases.  Perhaps best of all, however, is that Smith draws Mma Ramotswe in detail, so that we know her life, her family, and a bit about her country.  Despite pain in her past, Mma Ramotswe leads a fulfilling life -- in size 22 dresses (and thank you for that, Mr. Smith)!  I look forward to reading additional books in this series.	2005-08-26

Hidden within is a secret dossier that initially seems of little worth.  As the story unfolds, however, Szara is drawn into rings of spies, factions and counter-factions, Gestapo and anti-Gestapo, Old Bolsheviks and new Stalinists. Szara does not know who is working for whom, who will be killed next, or whether he can trust any of them.<br /><br />As the story takes place from the end of 1937 through 1940, the backdrop to all of this is an increasingly bellicose and anti-Semitic Nazi Germany, echoed by the Stalinist purges of intellectuals in the NKVD and throughout Soviet society. And no one knows this period -- right down to the details -- better than Alan Furst.  From doors that open \\"the width of an eye\\" to wireless transmitters humming through the night, from Gestapo  boarding trains to pre-war diplomats in formal suits, Furst owns this turf. Thanks to his skill, you can feel throughout the drumbeat of impending war.<br /><br />Five stars does not begin to do justice to the works of Alan Furst.  The history, both the broad events and small details, is impeccable.  (In this novel, Furst presents a fascinating, and to my knowledge, original, explanation for the Hitler-Stalin pact.)  And he really knows how to write.  I found myself rereading sentences because they expressed thoughts or feelings to perfection.<br /><br />This novel is rich in history, lyrically written with a master's eye.  If you like it, you will also enjoy Night Soldiers, Furst's novel of a Bulgarian NKVD agent during the Spanish Civil War.	2005-08-18

The first two-thirds of the book, however, are devoted not to actual spycraft, but to how Moran joined the CIA (in 1998) and, especially, her training at \\"The Farm.\\"  This is not uninteresting.  Among other things, the trainees learn about weapons, explosives, dead drops, and how to avoid tails and deal with border guards. In numerous simulations, they \\"rescue\\" \\"POWs\\" and meet with their targets in fictional countries.  By the time Moran was having rendezvous with her fictional agent in Philadelphia, however, the book got a little tiresome.<br /><br />The reason that so much space is devoted to training is that Moran actually had very little experience as a CIA case officer -- one overseas assignment, lasting about two years -- before she left the agency.  That assignment, in Macedonia, is interesting but the story is marred somewhat by Moran's clear bias toward Bulgarians and Albanians.  Moran quit the agency in early 2003, in part because the intrusive monitoring of case officers chafed and in part for political reasons.<br /><br />For Lindsay Moran, the CIA was just one brief stop in a sequence of experiences.  Thus, the book gives a good description of the training given CIA officers, but it is not a story of the adventures one would have in a long career as a spy. There are  many other books that fill that role, such as \\"The Champagne Spy,\\" by Wolfgang Lodz, or \\"Man Without a Face,\\" by Markus Wolf.  This book, however, provides a fairly interesting description of CIA training and of how a very self-impressed young woman coped with the strictures and isolation associated with being a case officer.	2005-08-06

Recently-widowed Mary DiNunzio, who now shares her apartment with only an indifferent cat, starts receiving strange messages and telephone calls.  When she is followed by an unknown person in a non-descript dark car, and her apartment is entered, things start becoming alarming.  Since Mary is up for partnership at Stalling & Webb, she suspects that the culprit may be a competitor, or someone else who is attempting to thwart her ambitions.<br /><br />The novel's best feature is its on-the-nose description of law firm life.  Any female litigator who has spent some time in court will wince  with recognition at the opening chapter.  One need not have been actually forced to sing to recognize the hubris of certain judges as it is played out in motion practice.  And how's this analysis of how a firm runs:<br /><br />\\"I walk back to my office.  I've done my job, which is to make Martin look good.  That's why he goes alone to Berkowitz's office, to take credit for the writ.  Likewise, since Martin's raison d'etre is to make Berkowitz look good, he'll let Berkowitz take the credit when he telephones Harbison's General Counsel.  Because Berkowitz has made the GC look good to his CEO, the GC will send him more cases.  ASAP.  And partners who bring in the most business make the most money.\\"<br /><br />Game, set and match.<br /><br />My only slight disappointment with this book is that while you will keep guessing \\"who done it,\\" the ending is somewhat contrived -- it does not make too much sense that the guilty party would be who she or he is. As in all good mysteries, however, the ends are neatly tied up.  This book is a great first novel by one who would soon thereafter win an Edgar.	2005-07-30

This year's summer sleeper does not disappoint.  \\"Prep\\" is a beautifully written account of the life of a middle-class scholarship student from South Bend, Indiana at \\"Ault,\\" a New England prep school remarkably similar to Groton.  Lee Fiora, in perhaps her last act of ambition, applied to various boarding schools and convinced her mattress-salesman father and bookkeeper mother to allow her to head East.  Lee goes from being an outstanding student at South Bend public schools to a mediocre student at Ault.  Embarrassed by her background (and by her family itself, particularly in a memorable section on \\"Parents Weekend\\"), Lee's insecurity hampers her from truly being a part of Ault.  Lee secretly pines for one of the class stars, but doubts that she is the sort whom he would ever want to marry.<br /><br />Sittenfeld asks us to question whether schools like Ault, while clearly providing an excellent education, are really the best place for teenagers. The insularity of these schools, coupled with the wealth of most of the students, leads to a narrowness of outlook.  I came away believing that Lee Fiora would probably have been better served by the fictitious \\"Marvin Thompson High School,\\" where she would have been a star student and involved in school activities -- and would have undoubtedly wound up at the very same university she ultimately attended.<br /><br />Before picking up \\"Prep,\\" I wondered if it would resonate with one who attended (30 years ago) an overcrowded New York City public high school.  The truth is that you need not have been a prep school student to understand or relate to this book.  Every high school is its own miniature web of intrigue, with tangled relationships, ins and outs, the cool and the nerds, and a hierarchy of status which vanishes after the graduates go their separate ways. Boarding school no doubt exaggerates the hothouse atmosphere, but even prep school graduates are likely to agree with Lee Fiora that \\"as more and more years passed .  .  .  the time I had known any of my classmates, would feel decreasingly significant; eventually, it would be only a backdrop to our real lives.\\"<br /><br />Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel is engaging and well worth your time.p school graduates are likely to agree with Lee Fiora that \\"as more and more years passed .  .  .  the time I had known any of my classmates, would feel decreasingly significant; eventually, it would be only a backdrop to our real lives.\\" <br /> <br />Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel is engaging and well worth your time.	2005-07-21

Through ground-breaking new research and the reliance on original source materials, the Radoshes have compiled a thorough re-examination of the enchantment by some in the film industry with the Communist Party, and their betrayal by that very same party.<br /><br />The Radoshes describe the infatuation of \\"the Hollywood Party\\" from its roots in the 1930s, when several visited the Soviet Union.  They demonstrate that, far from being innocent, the \\"Hollywood Ten\\" were committed Communists, who used and abused free-speech supporters (like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) for their own ends. The Communist Party, in turn, cynically used the \\"Ten\\" for its own ends -- trotting them out to speak at unrelated left-wing events for years, which prevented the Ten from individually rehabilitating their images and obtaining work.  The authors also describe the way the CP line was inserted in several films, most notoriously, \\"Mission to Moscow.\\" This film, designed to turn the views of a skeptical American public toward the USSR during World War II, whitewashes Stalin's purge trials of the 1930s, where many truly innocent were tortured into confessing and executed.  Perhaps most interesting is the difficult path faced by those who broke with the Party and either \\"named names\\" or walked a fine line to avoid naming names.  For many, being seen as an informer was worse than preventing and exposing genuine Communist infiltration.<br /><br />If I have any criticisms of the book, it is that the Radoshes did not take their exploration of the film colony's long romance with the left through the Vietnam War years and today. While the blacklist years were seminal, many in Hollywood contine to lean left even after the fall of the USSR, and take almost reflexively anti-Bush positions today. We are left to wonder what the leftist fathers passed on to their sons. Perhaps the authors will address this issue in a subsequent book.

It was cool.  It was cutting edge. It was, according to this book, a massive fraud.<br /><br />The authors take you, step by step, through the creation of Enron from Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, through the early gas pipeline crises, to the point where the business became, at best, schizophrenic.  Enron -- despite all its McKinsey talent (or because of it?) -- lost any sense of what it was and what its business should be.  On the one hand, it spread (famously or infamously) into power trading.  The trades always looked good, thanks to the use of \\"mark to market\\" accounting.  At the same time, Enron expanded its international deal-making in hard assets.  Its deals always looked profitable, because those who put them together were rewarded for the formation of the deal (with future profits again \\"marked to market\\"), rather than for making any specific project actually work.<br /><br />As losses inevitably mounted, Enron attempted to bail itself out with creative accounting.  And thus followed a convoluted series of sham corporations and off-balance-sheet debt schemes that ultimately spiraled out of control.  Although Enron's CFO, Andy Fastow, is often blamed for the problems, the authors rightly note: \\"Those who want to blame all of Enron's woes on the greedy former CFO claim that Enron was a good business brought down by Andy Fastow.  But that was never true.  Ultimately, Enron was a bad business that was, for a time, propped up by Andy Fastow.\\"<br /><br />They're all here -- sanctimonious Kenneth Lay, hard-nosed Rich  Kinder, magnetic blonde Rebecca Mark (former girlfriend of John Wing, who took over his business), Andy Fastow, backstabbing traders, lawyers, accountants, more lawyers, more accountants, and the infamous Jeff Skilling.  It would be a soap opera if it weren't real.  The authors manage to hold your interest through deal after disastrous deal, scheme after convoluted scheme, and more accounting transactions than you'd ever thought possible.  (Although I am an attorney for an electric utility, and I have some training in accounting and finance, it took a great deal of effort for me to follow some of these convoluted schemes, even in the simplified form presented in the book.) The fact that the book never lags is a testament to the authors.  They have presented a difficult subject clearly.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book raises the important questions:  Even if we assume that Skilling, et al, were \\"smoking their own dope,\\" why were so many outsiders willing to be hoodwinked for so long?  Why did Arthur Andersen, once a respected accounting firm, go along with Enron's shenanigans?  Why did investment banks continue to fund Enron -- well after there were warning signs of trouble?  Why did independent Wall Street analysts continue to rate Enron a \\"buy\\"? Why did credit rating agencies believe the hype, and not downgrade Enron sooner?  And where on earth was the Securities and Exchange Commission?<br /><br />Although the smartest guys in the room are now the smartest guys in the penitentiary, there is still a lot for us to learn from this story.

Much of the housing panic Talbott describes in charts can be known intuitively: spend some time at open houses, where potential buyers crowd into tiny bedrooms; be one of a dozen to bid (tens of thousands over asking price) on a home; watch homes go for $100,000 over listing price. At the higher end, Talbott's early predictions are also correct:  homes priced 1.5 million and more stay on the market for a long time.  As many have stated, the housing bubble bursts from the top down, and this may be a sign of the burst.<br /><br />Although I tend to agree with Talbott's arguments, I cannot give this book a higher rating.  The problem is that much of the evidence and charts Talbot marshals to support his thesis are flawed or misleading.  For example, Talbott emphasizes the fact that in most markets the price per square foot of personal homes exceeds the price per square foot of apartment buildings.  To Talbott, this indicates that the homes are overpriced.  To me, this is comparing apples and oranges.  An apartment building is essentially a small business. In many cities the rents a landlord can obtain are subject to rent control, thus capping the profits from the business.  In those circumstances, a building will sell for less.  Additionally, in those cities where rent control is in effect, fewer apartment buildings are constructed.  Thus, the housing stock of apartment buildings is older, on average, than the stock of personal homes and worth less.  Finally, Talbott does not account for the fact that in tight housing markets, condos are leased out and add to the rental supply.  These condos, when sold, figure in the price  statistics of \\"single family homes,\\" but they are really rental units.<br /><br />Likewise, Talbott's claim that the increase of women in the work force means that more home purchases rely on two incomes may be true, but the chart he produces doesn't prove it.  Sure, more women work.  But there are also more single women, buying houses and condos with only one income, than there were in 1960.  And the chart Talbott prints on page 30, which shows the percentage of MEN in the workforce declining from 90% in 1960 to 78% in 1999 does not support his analysis.  Presumably, at least some of those men are in one-income families, where the mortgage is paid by the wife.<br /><br />Talbott is correct in pointing out that many Americans are over-leveraged and even a small decline in housing prices could cause many (particularly sub-prime borrowers) to seek bankruptcy protection.  Where Talbott's work shines is in its discussion of the real problems confronting Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the private mortgage insurers.  These issues are of serious concern and could cause significant problems should housing prices tank.<br /><br />Overall, I think Talbott has made his case. A work of this nature, however, should be more rigorous in its analysis and presentation.e work force means that more home purchases rely on two incomes may be true, but the chart he produces doesn't prove it.

Nor is it, really, about Maura Conlon-McIvor's father in his role as an FBI agent.  It is, instead, a memoir of the childhold of an Irish-American girl attempting to understand her non-communicative, somewhat dysfunctional father, and loving and caring for her Down's Syndrome brother.  This brother, Joey, and Maura's exceptionally warm mother, are the glue that holds this family together.<br /><br />It is a testament to Maura's parents that when their severely-retarded son Joey was born, they did not put him into an institution, which would have been common in the mid-1960s.  Maura herself is fiercely protective of Joey, and believes that anyone without a Down's syndrome child in the family is missing something.  This is an attitude shared by her father, who believes that the developmentally disabled are really the smart ones and the so-called \\"normal\\" people are ignorant.  When you read about some of the reactions of the Conlon's neighbors (which range from shock, to avoidance, to guilty stares, to embarrassment and, occasionally, caring and compassion), you don't doubt that this is true.<br /><br />Maura has a bigger problem, however, communicating with her father who, in her eyes, speaks in some sort of code.  Joe Conlon obviously loves his five children, and his love is demonstrated by doing things, rather than talking (whenever Conlon does not want to answer a question, he changes the subject entirely.)  Maura believes, incorrectly, that Joe Conlon's job as an FBI special agent precludes him from talking about anything substantive.  In fact, as Maura discovers, Conlon's behavior was nothing learned at Quantico or ordered by J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />The story warmly evokes 1960s Los Angeles.  Maura Conlon lived with with her parents, sister and three brothers in an unidentified suburb of Los Angeles (20 minutes from Disneyland and 40 minutes from Hollywood.)  The name of the suburb doesn't matter -- whether it's Downey or Fullerton or Los Alamitos or West Covina or Azusa, or any one of the other suburbs that run into one another in this part of the world, the story would be the same. It is hilarious, however, to read about young Maura playing Nancy Drew, writing down license plate numbers and desperately looking for high intrigue in this bland world of tract homes.<br /><br />What is also relevant is Maura's religious Catholic upbringing, which provides Maura with a strong faith, a strict way to live, and more than a few interesting stories.  A less salutory aspect is that Maura grows up strictly differentiating between \\"Catholics\\" and \\"publics,\\" believing, among other things, that public school kids put drugs in the mustard and ketchup bottles.  This belief is proven false when Maura herself goes to public school, with the backing of her former teacher, a nun.<br /><br />Above all, this is the story of a painfully shy, highly imaginative girl who finally finds her own voice.  Maura Conlon-McIvor has a compelling story to tell, which is well worth reading.  As a contemporary of the author, I enjoyed the 1960s references, which took me back to my youth.  Yet Maura Conlon-McIvor's story is unique.  I think it gives a greater understanding of living with and loving the disabled than anything I've read thus far.

This German-Jewish history begins much earlier, in 1743, and ends before the Third Reich has obliterated the German Jewish community. It is a sobering tale.<br /><br />The story of Jews in Germany is essentially one of a long unrequited love affair.  From decade to decade, and century to century, the Jews featured in this book wanted nothing more than to be Germans. They did everything in their power to demonstrate their \\"Germanness,\\" from eagerly volunteering to fight for Germany in the Franco-Prussian and First World Wars, to making important scientific discoveries (10 German Jews won Nobel prizes in science), to financing various principalities, to writing great German poetry.  A good many Jews were even willing to convert to Christianity in order to blend in, or to be able to practice their professions.  The rulers of various German states (there was no united \\"Germany\\" until 1871)  cynically used Jews as a source of funds, allowed them minimal rights, and expelled or denied them advancement at whim.<br /><br />Still, the people who refused to call themselves \\"German Jews\\" (\\"We are German citizens of the Jewish faith!\\") kept abasing themselves to join this society.  One wonders why.  One reason is that Germany did have a lot to offer -- it was a leader in philosophy, science, music and art.  A historian visiting Berlin in the 1970s said that the 20th Century could have been the German century.  Another reason is that as bad as Germany was, it treated its Jews better than many other places in Europe, particularly Russia. And in the Weimar Era, German Jews were represented at all levels of government: the Foreign Minister was a Jew, as was the head of a short-lived socialist government in Bavaria.  Jews were leaders in science, architecture, music and theatre.  German Jews even believed that they were better off than their co-religionists in the United States,where Jews were excluded from many neighborhoods and jobs, and Ivy League schools had quotas. (Of course, there is nothing in American Jewish history remotely similar to the German religious exclusions, or, worse still, \\"Hep, Hep!\\" riots.)<br /><br />The major flaw in this book is that while it discusses the impact of German Jews on Germany, it gives short shrift to the impact of German Jews on Jewish life, and neglects the more religious Jews altogether. The omission of Samson Raphael Hirsch, one of the greatest Orthodox leaders of all time, is inexplicable. The philosophy of \\"Torah im Derech Eretz,\\" i.e., that Jews should simultaneously study Torah and  be conversant with modern culture and thought, is the foundation of the Modern Orthodox movement -- and it started in Germany.<br /><br />It is sometimes difficult to wade through long non-fiction books, especially history, but not this one. The book grabs you in the beginning and never lags. (Not only is Elon a great writer, but he has made the not-inconsiderable effort to translate German poetry into rhymed English!)  The story is painful, and often heartbreaking, but well worth the effort.in the United States,where Jews were excluded from many neighborhoods and jobs, and Ivy League schools had quotas.

I have been an employer and an employee, both boss and bossed, and believe that we all can use a good (emphasize \\"good\\") self-help book now and then. This book enables the reader to pinpoint self-defeating behaviors and correct them, or at least control them.<br /><br />In my experience, there are three categories of criticism.  The first one is task-related, and your boss will almost always give it to you: \\"This presentation should be reorganized.\\" \\"We need a better argument for ....\\" \\"Next time include slides on the overhead projector.\\" The second category is personal, but easily fixable, and your boss will give it to you (perhaps with some trepidation): \\"A tube top is just not 'business casual.'\\" \\"You need to start being on time for the 7:00 am meetings.\\"  The third category is what your boss will not tell you until it's too late: \\"you turn people off,\\" \\"you are too aggressive\\" or \\"you are too indecisive.\\"  The reason she won't is that these criticisms are of difficult-to-describe personality traits and the message is always uncomfortable to deliver.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the problems that your boss will not discuss with you (until after you have lost that promotion or job) are the very problems that are the most serious and can have the biggest ramifications for your career.  That's where this book comes in.  It contains a step-by-step process for identifying your trouble spots and addressing them.  If you're not brave enough to actually engage people in discussions about your flaws (as the book suggests), it contains several chapters on common personality problems and suggested substitute behaviors. It also contains a chapter on repairing your image, if it comes to that.<br /><br />The book takes a non-judgmental approach, pointing out that many personality characteristics may be hereditary. Yet, that makes it no less important to address them.  (For example, if you knew that you had a gene which predisposed you to getting  lung cancer, wouldn't you be even more careful not to smoke?) I learned a great deal from this book.  Since none of us is perfect, I would highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to catch and fix bad behaviors early on, before they can ruin your career.many personality characteristics may be hereditary.

Her childhood was filled with Young Pioneer meetings, clubs, school, recycling, swearing allegiance to world socialism and summer camp. But there was a dark side to all this.  As Hensel writes, \\" .  .  . to avoid being denounced to the secret police, you also had to watch what you said to whom.  You had to really trust your friends.\\"  Hensel's parents protected her from the government man who came around offering sports scholarships to girls who wound up with \\"man sized shoulders and physiques.\\" There was a constant hunt for stylish clothes, Western food, and appropriate Christmas gifts.<br /><br />In 1990, a year after the fall of the Wall, the GDR came to an end. Hensel would spend her high school years in the same place, but in a different country.  Her generation was able to adjust by learning West German slang, figuring out which clothes to wear, and understanding that the television shows and other artifacts of her childhood were gone. Hensel's parents' generation, however, did not adjust as well.  They weren't just losing comic books, they were losing their jobs: the new owners of former-GDR factories shut them down and many teachers and other civil servants were forced out.  These middle-aged people who had spent their lives under socialism could not easily adjust to the change to a market economy.<br /><br />Hensel's experience is similar to those of immigrants to a different country, where the children adapt to the new culture more easily and wind up interpreting it for their parents.  And, like some immigrants, Hensel's generation of GDR children wound up both more confident than their parents (\\"We felt like monarchs, founding a new kingdom on the ruins of the old\\") and protective of them.  The rub is that these \\"immigrant\\" parents are German, speak German fluently, and haven't moved an inch.<br /><br />This is the third personal memoir of life inside the GDR that I've read, and the only one to describe a childhood in East Germany from 1976 until the fall of the Wall.  Hensel has no axe to grind, and no need to justify the GDR or its policies.  She was not a communist.  She did not voluntarily emmigrate to the GDR -- she was born there.  The book is thus neither \\"Ostalgie\\" (nostalgia for the East) nor specifically anti-GDR. It is just an accurate and interesting description of life before and after the wall.<br /><br />I have not been able to find a memoir of life in the GDR written by someone in Hensel's parents' generation (probably born in the late 1940s or early 1950s.) It would be interesting to read the story told from the perspective of one who was born in the GDR and lived in it through middle age.  However, I can recommend  other memoirs of life in East Germany: \\"Twelve Years\\" by Joel Agee, who lived as a child in East Germany from 1948 to 1960; and \\"Crossing the River,\\" by Victor Grossman, an American Communist who, as a soldier stationed in West Germany, fled to the GDR in 1952 and still lives in eastern Berlin.e read, and the only one to describe a childhood in East Germany from 1976 until the fall of the Wall.

There was a lot less traffic in the other direction.  This is the story of one man who fled the West and wound up \\"behind the Iron Curtain\\" in East Germany.  American-born Victor Grossman (n&eacute; Stephen Wechsler) was literally a card-carrying Communist until he was drafted into the US Army -- a fact he did not disclose on a form asking whether he had ever belonged to any subversive organizations.  In 1952, as an American soldier stationed in West Germany, Grossman received a letter requiring him to answer charges that he had lied under oath.  Instead, Grossman went to then-occupied Austria and swam across the Danube into the Soviet zone. After being detained by Soviet intelligence, Grossman was given a new life and identity in the \\"German Democratic Republic.\\"<br /><br />Grossman was, is and remains a true believer in Communism. Grossman tells us that he got a thrill when he saw his first Soviet soldier, with the red star on his hat.  Grossman justifies the building of the Berlin Wall and minimizes the wrongs of the Stasi, who except for dissidents were \\"unpleasant but less frightening than now portrayed.\\" The book is written from a Communist perspective, which again and again minimizes the wrongs of the GDR and magnifies the wrongs of the United States.  Yet, Grossman's argument that German communism did not necessarily preclude democracy collapses upon closer examination.  A big problem for the GDR is that it had to live cheek by jowl with a free-market economy.  If, as Grossman claims, the Berlin Wall was necessary to prevent GDR-educated professionals from fleeing and GDR-subsidized goods from being sold in West Germany at higher prices, then the GDR would have to remain a closed state to function.  And that meant that GDR residents would not have the ultimate freedom to \\"vote with their feet\\" and leave.  Grossman voluntarily chose to live under communism -- other East Germans did not have that choice.  Their \\"revolution,\\" such as it was, was imposed by the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Nonetheless, even someone like me, whose political views are 180 degrees opposite from Grossman's, found the book engaging.  One reason is that Grossman's story is so unusual. Very few American servicemen fled to East Germany and fewer probably met or interacted with as wide a range of people, including foreign celebrities like Jane Fonda.  Additionally, there are very few memoirs written by Communists who came of age in the 1940s: most are written by those from the \\"popular front\\" era of the 1930s or the New Left of the 1960s. This book takes the reader to factory life in Buffalo, concerts by Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger, and all over the GDR.  And the book is well-written: Grossman makes the most persuasive case possible for the benefits of his adopted country.<br /><br />My personal opinion is this: As an American, I'm frankly glad that Victor Grossman left the country.  Anyone who dislikes the American system as much as he does, and goes AWOL from the US Army to East Germany at the height of the Cold War, should live elsewhere.  As a reader, however, I'm glad to have been able to read his book.  While the author's views are (in my opinion) wrongheaded, the book never fails to be fascinating.y chose to live under communism -- other East Germans did not have that choice.

Eight-year-old Joel Agee was brought by his mother and stepfather to the Soviet zone of Germany (what would become East Germany) in 1948 and lived there for the next 12 years.  As Agee's stepfather, Bodo Uhse, was a prominent Communist, Agee had the best that East Germany could offer: a villa with servants, summers at the Baltic Sea, and numerous opportunities to recover from his dismal performance at school.  Agee does provide an insight as to how the Communist intelligentsia in that country thought -- their explanations for the closed border, their view of the Stalinist (and Soviet-bloc) purges in the early 50s, and their conflicting views of Khruschev's revelations.  This memoir is also a coming-of-age story, filled with teenage angst and sexual frustration. What distinguishes this from many other memoirs is that it is exceptionally well-written.  Although Agee was never able to get his bearings in the East German school system (or was, as we would say today, a \\"slacker\\") his descriptions are almost poetic. Well worth reading.	2005-02-21

This book answers the question many of us have: \\"What was it like to live as a closely-watched individual in one of the most repressive societies on Earth?\\"  While the wall itself has been almost entirely torn down, Funder still found the \\"inner wall\\" -- the differences in attitude and beliefs of those who had lived in the freedom of West Germany and those who had grown up in the East.<br /><br />After touring the former Stasi headquarters in Leipzig, Funder meets Miriam Weber, who attempted to escape from East Berlin.  Her story is riveting, like a John LeCarre novel, except real.  Funder tells us of Sigrid Paul. The Stasi dangled before Frau Paul the opportunity to visit her terribly ill son in the West -- at the price of becoming a Stasi informant.  And Julia, loyal to the regime, who accidentally gets cross-wise with the State and whose prospects are then destroyed.  Funder tells of ex-Stasi men, some who were coerced into joining, others who willingly grabbed the chance at adventure.<br /><br />There are many funny moments in the book as well.  In describing the regime's unpopular propagandist and his even-less-popular television show, Funder explains that scheduling the show immediately after beloved movies caused a weekly electricity crisis.  Power plant workers had to be on alert: \\"First, everyone tuned in at once to the movie, so they went into overdrive.  Then, when 'The Black Channel' came on, the workers had to struggle to stop the power supply from collapsing under a backsurge as everyone, simultaneously, switched off their sets.\\" In well-written explanatory passages, Funder also demonstrates that she understands what made the leaders of the GDR tick: \\"Mielke and Honecker grew up fighting the real evil of Nazism.  And they kept on fighting the west, which they saw as Nazism's successor, for forty-five years after the war ended.  .  .  They never wanted to stop.\\"<br /><br />Funder is a great writer, and there are many beautifully written passages in the book.  Her description of the sights and smells of the GDR can make you think you are there. This is not a comprehensive history of the Stasi (John Koehler has written the best one), but it is the best-written account of average (and courageous) people in \\"Stasiland.\\"the war ended.  .  .

He has done the world a service.  Koehler has brought to light the plight of the victims of one of the world's most chillingly efficient spy agencies, whose stories deserve to be told.  Read about Horst Erdmann, a medical student who was arrested for passing out leaflets calling for free elections.  Erdmann was sentenced to eleven years of hard labor under abominable conditions.  Read about R&uuml;diger Knechtel, imprisoned for throwing a bottle over the Berlin Wall, which contained a message explaining his plight.  Read about the torture suffered by Josef Kneifel.  Read and learn what the East German prisons were like.  How many were killed, imprisoned, and tortured, simply for wanting to leave the German \\"Democratic Republic\\"?<br /><br />But the story starts much earlier, before World War II, with the man who ultimately was to become the head of the Stasi for nearly 40 years, Erich Mielke.  Koehler gives you Mielke's background, which included killing two (Weimar Republic-era) policemen and his subsequent escape to Russia, where he learned espionage.  Mielke's own biography provides insight into the Stasi.  Mielke always viewed the Stasi as akin to Felix Dzerzhinski's \\"Chekists,\\" who ruthlessly defended the communist revolution in the USSR by persecuting its dissenters.  Under Mielke's view, communist revolutions would always be opposed by \\"counterrevolutionary\\" forces - which sadly included anyone who wanted to speak his mind, vote, or even simply leave - and every communist country required a secret police force to battle those elements.  As such, the Stasi (whose officers and informants were something like 1 out of every 66 GDR citizens) was necessary and integral to the functioning of the GDR.<br /><br />Koehler reports on all aspects of the Stasi, from the agency's formation to its demise.  Koehler describes the Stasi's strong ties to the KGB, and its thorough spying on East German citizens.  We read about the Stasi's foreign operations, too.  While West Germany was the Stasi's main area of operations, it spied on NATO and the United States as well.  It forged ties with Third World countries and used them as bases of operations.  Koehler explains at length the Stasi's connection to international terrorists and the West German Red Army Faction (aka the \\"Bader Meinhof gang\\"), activities which disgusted many of the Stasi's own agents.  Koehler explains that the money spent on the Stasi and its activities almost certainly accelerated the bankruptcy of the GDR.<br /><br />This is a dense, thoroughly researched book.  As one reviewer noted, it does contain typos.  However, I cannot in good conscience deduct any stars for the typographical errors, because this is truly a fine, meticulously documented book.  One gets the sense that the author was driven to tell the whole story of this organization in all its aspects.  He has succeeded.

It is not easy to do justice to cuisine in a country as large and varied as the United States.  This book is up to the task: it takes you through the US region by region and explores the food unique to each.  The photographs are gorgeous and give you the feel not just of the food common to that area, but the land and culture itself.  The text is fascinating, with separate articles on different facets of cooking. The book provides a good sampling of recipes for each region as well.<br /><br />Because of the size and scope of the country, however, the book simply cannot provide a complete set of recipes of American cooking (it is already of phenomenal size and scope -- there is a good reason why Amazon charges extra to ship it.)  Thus, while it has recipes for each region, it is really more a culinary guide than a cookbook.  The book may inspire you to learn more about different American regional cuisines.  If after reading it, you wish to focus in on a specific region, may I suggest you try, for New England, \\"The New England Cookbook,\\" by Brooke Dojny.  Marcia Adams has written several excellent cookbooks of Midwestern cooking; my personal favorite is \\"Heartland,\\" which you may be able to get second-hand.<br /><br />Overall, a phenomenal gastronomic tour of the United States.

Books	2	19	23	N	N	There Are No Shortcuts	There are nuggets of wisdom in \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\"  The central point of the book, that \\"the poor work for money, the rich make money work for them,\\" led to an important paradigm shift for me. Instead of investing in assets that use money (a car, a boat), Kiyosaki urges us to invest in assets that make money (stocks, bonds, real estate.) Kiyosaki has important things to say about home ownership -- it is not right for everyone, particularly if you are sinking all of your potential investment money into one home.  He also correctly warns against getting on the treadmill of earning more, then spending more, then needing to earn more, etc.<br /><br />Having said that, the book has too many flaws to really recommend it.  Kiyosaki is no fan of formal education, but unless you are born rich, the only way you can create a stake is by getting a good enough job to enable you to save.  Kiyosaki urges people to form corporations (which pay expenses before they pay taxes), but fails to note the expenses involved, not the least of which is the requirement to pay corporate taxes before distributions are made to shareholders (leading to \\"double taxation.\\")  Kiyosaki discusses the benefits of investing in real estate, but fails to note that being a landlord is not easy and real estate investments are often risky.  And finally, Kiyosaki's allusions to investments open only to insiders is troubling.  I hope he does not mean trading on inside information, which is a violation of the law.<br /><br />I don't know if Kiyosaki really had a rich Dad -- the conversations that \\"Rich Dad\\" supposedly had with nine-year-old Kiyosaki do not ring true.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  Use the book for its kernels of wisdom, but don't tell your boss to \\"take this job and shove it.\\"	2005-01-18

Ash, a Briton, was a graduate student at Humboldt University in the late 1970s-early 1980s. As a foreigner in East Germany, he was monitored by the ever-thorough Stasi, which managed to keep records on millions of East German citizens as well.  Reading his Stasi file (made available after German unification) forces Ash to remember incidents from his past and reveals to him the identities of numerous Stasi informants -- some of whom were his friends.  Ash then visits these informants and confronts them with evidence of their collaboration.  In perhaps the most interesting part of the book, Ash visits the Stasi officers in charge of his case.<br /><br />While Ash's writings caused him to be banned from East Germany, he was never imprisoned, nor was he subject to the depradations faced by average citizens of the GDR. Ash acknowledges that as a foreigner, he was always free to leave, and this makes his file less interesting than those of true dissidents.  Ash describes, however, the story of an East German dissident who discovered that her own husband was informing the Stasi of her activities and discusses his friendships with brave East Germans who bucked the regime, and paid the price for it.<br /><br />This is not the definitive work on the Stasi.  It provides some background of the agency, but if you are looking for a more thorough treatment, look to \\"Stasi: The Untold Story of East Germany's Secret Police,\\" by John Koehler.  This book is worth reading, however, to understand, through the file of one man, why men joined the Stasi and how the Stasi turned so many ordinary East Germans into informants.  Ash also raises important moral questions about spying and intelligence agencies, which are relevant to free societies as well.	2005-01-11

Truss is in a conspiracy with her readers to stamp out bad grammar, from the missing exclamation point in \\"Stop Children Crossing\\" to the unnecessary apostrophe in \\"Banana's For Sale.\\" The author helpfully and humorously clarifies the rules of punctuation.<br /><br />I am always on the lookout for books that will improve my grammar.  I certainly enjoyed reading this one.  Truss has a witty, breezy style that makes the book engaging and humorous.  I learned a few things, too.  Having said that, the book is not without its flaws.  First, sometimes Truss's humor comes across as condescension toward those who are not as grammar-obsessed as she (or those who have not had the opportunity to learn the subject.)  Second, the American version of the book really should have been revised to reflect American usage (although Truss does attempt to explain the differences.) Finally, someone who writes a book about punctation should ensure that her book is error-free. This book is not.  In addition to the haphazard use of the semicolon and the comma, Truss makes mistakes in parallelism; the book just contains too many errors.<br /><br />For those who really need to learn grammar, I recommend \\"Usage and Abusage,\\" by Eric Partridge. In the meantime, \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" is a good, but flawed, introduction to punctuation.	2005-01-11

The author, \\"The Man Without A Face\\" (so called because no Western intelligence agency had his picture) ran the Hauptverwaltung Aufkl&auml;rung (HVA), the foreign intelligence section of the feared East German \\"Ministerium f&uuml;r Staatssicherheit\\" or Stasi.  The HVA was one of the most effective foreign intelligence services during the Cold War.<br /><br />The book is a fascinating, insider's view of the HVA.  The Stasi's main target was West Germany, and the frighteningly efficient HVA managed to place agents in many key positions in or near the seats of power of West Germany and NATO.  We learn how the author used \\"Romeo\\" traps, taking advantage of the post-war gender imbalance in Germany to send male spies to woo lonely West German secretaries in key positions. It was extremely disconcerting for me, as an American, to learn that every single one of the CIA's agents who attempted to infiltrate East Germany was either an East German plant or a double agent.<br /><br />Having said that, it is also important to say that Markus Wolf is and remains an unreconstructed Communist.  He is the German version of a \\"red diaper baby\\"; his parents were Communists and his faith in communism was forged when his partially-Jewish family was given refuge by Stalin from the Nazi holocaust. He is a still true believer -- convinced that communism failed only because of the way it was implemented, not due to any flaws in the ideology itself. This view permeates the book.<br /><br />Wolf also failed personally to speak up about the regime's behavior.  There are far too many times we hear in the book that \\"that wasn't my department\\" -- the spying on East German citizens, the long sentences for those who attempted to escape.  Indeed, Wolf tells us that he never visited an East German prison.  He does own up, in part, to the GDR's support of terrorist groups, which led to calamities from which we are still reeling.<br /><br />The book not only gives an inside view of how spying is done, but it raises a number of issues.  For one thing, after two separate countries unify, what should be the status of individuals from one country who in the past spied on the other?  The unified German government attempted to try Wolf for treason, but was stymied, as he only became a citizen of the \\"Federal Republic of Germany\\" after unification.  Overall, a fascinating, well-written, worthwhile read -- but go elsewhere to find a description of the Stasi in its entirety or an unbiased view of East German policy.n.

This wonderful cookbook is perfect for the single vegan.  For each week, the book contains a shopping list of all ingredients needed for that week's recipes.  No running to the supermarket to pick up additional food and no waste!  I really like no longer having to divide the ingredients in recipes by four or six -- these recipes are made for one person.  The shopping list is a great idea -- I appreciate not being left at the end of the week with 1/2 can of beans, for example.<br />I have cooked every single recipe in the book, with the exception of some of the desserts. The recipes are varied, both in type of food and in ingredients used.  I have rarely come across a cookbook with as high a proportion of the recipes ones I would definitely cook again.  As with any cookbook, there are a few nits:<br />(1) For a very few weeks, ingredients are missing on the shopping list.  (Usually, it's only a carrot or an extra onion.)<br />(2) Only one recipe did not seem to work at all -- the dumpling recipe.  This may be due more to my technique than the recipe.<br />(3) There are very few ingredients that can't be found in a typical supermarket -- I have been able to find everything at  my local natural foods grocer.<br />This book has become the backbone of my food plan.  I look forward to coming home to varied, easy-to-prepare meals -- often with enough left over for breakfast!	2004-01-22

After joining the Rand Daily Mail in 1958, author Benjamin Pogrund broadened the newspaper's  coverage of &quot;African affairs,&quot; reporting on facets of black South African life given short shrift by most &quot;mainstream&quot; newspapers.<br />It was no easy task to report the news while constrained by numerous, ever-expanding, secrecy laws.  While the South Africa portrayed in this book was no Soviet Union - English-language newspapers, the Rand Daily Mail in particular, were able to criticize apartheid in the strongest terms - the expanding web of press restrictions prevented journalists from fully informing the public of what it needed to know.  Perhaps the most interesting section of the book is the description of the Mail's attempt to report on horrifying conditions in South Africa's prisons, reportage which caused Pogrund to face criminal charges for violation of the Prisons Act.  This type of reporting (and editing, by Laurence Gandar) took guts.<br />Although the book does not emphasize the personal life of the author, one nugget seemed to encapsulate what it must have been like to live in the South Africa of that time: Pogrund refers to having had to overcome  &quot;the nervous habit of glancing over our shoulders - the hallmark of South Africans .  .  .&quot;  Other books have also alluded to the strange atmosphere of a society where no one knows who is working for which security agency - and the Mail was apparently infiltrated with various spies.  On that note, one of the most fascinating characters to make an appearance here is Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for State Security (BOSS), which apparently had microphones in the Mail's offices.  (van den Bergh also appears in &quot;Rivonia's Children,&quot; the outstanding book about the sabotage trial in which Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, and is the star of &quot;Inside BOSS, South Africa's Secret Service.&quot;  Both are also worth reading and will give different perspectives on the  same era.)<br />I have only two minor criticism of this book.  First, Pogrund's evident shock at the &quot;Muldergate&quot; information scandal jars.  Was it really such a surprise that a government which controlled the radio network would also seek surreptitiously to own a newspaper?  To this American reader, Muldergate comes across as  minor league.  To be fair, however, the scandal was significant enough at the time to take down the Vorster government.<br />Second, Pogrund sometimes tells us more than we needed to know about feuds between Saan (South African Associated Newspapers) management and the Mail editorial staff.  Yet, because this is a history of the Mail as much as the memoirs of Pogrund, some of that &quot;inside baseball&quot; was necessary - and the background did help to explain the machinations behind Saan's decision to close the Mail in 1985.  The closure of the Mail, possibly as the result of a television channel deal by Saan with then-President P.W. Botha, left Pogrund &quot;drained of energy and spirit.&quot;<br />This book is an unfailingly honest story of a brave journalist.  Despite the criticisms above, I believe the book has earned 5 stars as a comprehensive, readable account of journalism under and against apartheid.  I highly recommend it.&quot;Inside BOSS, South Africa's Secret Service.&quot;  Both are also worth reading and will give different perspectives on the  same era.)  <br />I have only two minor criticism of this book.

US	52576692	R1P6AGUZJ1NJY1	1587217546	272979538	Deadly Truth: A Novel Based Upon Actual Events in South Africa Under Apartheid	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Thrilling, Suspenseful Novel	I probably would never have found this book had Amazon.com not recommended it - and I would have missed a hidden treasure.  \\"Deadly Truth\\" is a gripping, \\"can't put it down,\\" novel based in apartheid-era South Africa.  David Bellon, the main character, is a liberal CEO of a food conglomerate in the Cape Province who tries, in his own way, to ameliorate the inequities of his society.  Through a series of events which I won't describe here (I don't want to spoil the plot!), Bellon is forced to do more, and thus runs afoul of Police Captain Eichstadt, whose unique interrogation methods are described in gruesome detail.<br />What makes this book so compelling is its honesty -- it is clearly based on a true story.  \\"Ceresdal,\\" the fictitious town in which events take place, sounds like the real town of Stellenbosch, and one of the authors was the CEO of an agribusiness in South Africa.  What goes on in the Ceresdal police station is in accord with non-fiction reports about the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS).  Thus, there is more than a ring of truth here - you get the feeling that these events actually occurred, and only the names have been changed to protect the innocent (and guilty.)<br />I have strong interests in South African history and in Jewish history, and hence was drawn to a story featuring Jews in South Africa.  Those who share these interests, or those who just want a picture of apartheid-era South Africa, will enjoy this book.  But you needn't care one way or the other about South Africa to enjoy \\"Deadly Truth.\\"  The book stands on its own as a compelling, fast-paced novel of danger and escape.	2001-05-12
