The book has very few pictures, which is so odd in guide of this kind, all you get is short discriptions of each building and I guess from this you are suppose to glean the image of the building, uh o.k.  This really is the worst city architecture guide I have come across, I usually love these guides, I have reviewed several and have given them high marks, I love L.A., I think that is why I am so disappointed in this particular book.   I had expected so much more, L.A. has so many interesting buildings, it's a shame that it does not have an architectural guide to match.  Hopefully someday someone will write a guide deserving of the title of this book; the city of angels desevers better, heck Buffalo deserves better than this.	2005-09-21

The black and white photos are beautiful, they are crisp and vivid.  The book is quite thorough, and I found the text to be scholarly and highly informative.  I was pleased that exterior as well as interior photos where used, the reader really gets a feel for the buildings and you get an excellent cross section of the top apartment buildings.  Chicago is second only to New York in luxurious apartment buildings and this book does an amazing job of cataloging the best examples, I loved this book.  The book even includes a silk book mark.  If you are the least bit interested in this subject, buy this book, you will not be disappointed, it is first rate. A book for those who love books.	2005-09-21

American is blessed with amazing houses, built mostly during the Gilded Age by business barons.  This book does a great job illustrating the different styles and discussing the houses that best embody these styles.  The color photos are vivid and crisp and the houses chosen are spectacular.  The text is highly informative and very interesting.  It is so refreshing that so many of these mansions have survived for so long and thankfully these examples have been well cared for.  It must have been difficult for the author to choose just one house to illustrate a style, but it's hard to argue with the ones she ultimatly chose.  Nice read.	2005-09-21

Baton Rouge is a very interesting city and from above you see things that you really cannot get a perspective of at ground level, like the Knox House in City Park, it is a gorgeous house from the road, but from the air it is spectacular.  The photos of the capital building are amazing and Gleason gives you a perspective from all angles.  I would have bought this book just for the pictures of the LSU campus, it is amazing from the ground, but breathtaking from the air.  If you have any interest in Baton Rouge or just wonderful airial photography then you will not be disappointed in this book.  Gleason does Baton Rouge proud.	2005-09-21

The book is quite thorough and does an commendable job of disecting various sections of the park.  The color photos are vivid and well thought out and the text is highly informative.  The author has a real love for the park and it comes out in her writing.  If you have never visited Central Park or have visited and fell in love with it like so many others, you will love this book.  This oasis really is the heart of New York City and to understand New York you have to understand the parks history  and its vast importantance to the city.  Central Parks importance to New York and New Yorkers cannot be overstated, I can't imagine the city without it.	2005-09-21

The photographs by Gleason are wonderful and the text gives you just the right amount of backstory.  It is amazing that this place has survived almost totally intact from the time of the Civil War.  Visiting Natchez really does feel like walking through history and this book is the next best thing to being there.  If you have any interest in the Old South or beautiful Civil War era mansions, or just fine photography, then you will enjoy this book.	2005-09-14

I knew about New Orleans of course and the great plantations, but I did not realize that the rest of the state had so many wonderful buildings, it was a real eye opener.  I thoroughly enjoyed the photographs and they cooresponded well with the text.  Louisiana is one of our most beautiful and unique states and I am so pleased that such a quality book has been written about its historic buildings, it's well deserved.	2005-09-07

The photographs are well conceived and the text, though not indepth, is informative.  If you are someone interested in the most famous mansions of Newport and appreciate quality photography then I believe you will be pleased with this book, if you are however, looking for an indepth guide to the all of the mansions, then you may want to wait on that book, which unfortunitly, as far as I can tell, has not been written.	2005-09-07

The author does not just focus on the big cities she covers smaller cities as well and in depth.  The book covers well known historic neighborhoods in the Western states, with highly informative text.  I found the book hard to put down. Being from the Houston area I was impressed with how well the author had researched Houston's best neighborhoods and I also appreciated the photographs of homes from each neighborhood, it gave the reader a visual and a feel for the houses in the neighborhood, I really cannot say enough good things about this book, it even maps the neighborhoods and shows the reader where they can find the museum homes.  It truly is a field guide in the best sence and I highly recommend it, I have been waiting for the Eastern states for several years now, I hope that it gets done, because if it is half as good as this book I will be the first to buy it.	2005-09-07

How on earth could anyone sign off on destroying this colossel beauty, it's something I just can't get my mind around.  I am so grateful that this was documented, as hard as it is too look at, people need witness these pictures to make sure it does not happen again.  Many people credit the outrage over the razing of this McKim, Mead, and White masterpiece with helping save Carnige Hall and Grand Central, which though appreciated, does not lessen the sadness over the loss of this New York City treasure, it really is such a tragic loss.  I highly recommend this book for its text, great visuals, and the power is thought it provoks: great book.	2005-09-07

I must take some exception to the review of Mr. Jendrysic, in all due respect he misses the point totally of perservation when he says the building was a white elephant that was in the wrong place and in the red, that may have all been true, but in those cases you find other uses for the building, like Paris did with the Orsay train station and the colossel Louvre as well as Versailles, I mean would you call for the pulling down of Versailles??? and the Orsey Museum is spectacular.  This was not just any building, this was a masterpiece a true treasure, that could have been coverted to other uses, buildings of this quality should be persevered, period, not torn down like some 50's tract house.  I highly recommend this book in everyway, if you have any interest in great buildings or just wonderful books quite frankly, then you will not be disappointed in this book, you are right about one think Mr. Jendrysic this book is first rate.	2005-09-07

It is amazing to see the breathe of Mckim, Mead, and Whites work, they really where THE Gilded Age architects.  Lord knows there where other great architects of the time, like Horace Trumbaur and Carrere and Hastings to name a few, but no firm had a better P.R. machine than this firm, namely Stanford White, it can be debated whether they where the best of the architects of the time, but nobody can debate their preeminence during the Gilded Age. Nice book, I recomended it.	2005-09-03

I enjoyed the text and felt quite knowledged after reading it.  I thought the pictures where bold and well selected, though not to the level of some books of this sort.  I especially enjoyed the section on Penn Station, wow, what a building, it is so disheartening that it was leveled for a very mediocre building that may find itself meeting the same fate as Penn Station soon: poetic justice I suppose.  I think instead of converting McKim, Mead, and White's Post Office Building into the new Penn Station, they should take the blue prints of the original and build it, this was the firms best work, it's a disgrace that is was so underappreciated by the city govenment a the time.  At anyrate, if you have any interest in great Gilded Age architecture, you will certainly enjoy this book, just to get a peek inside some of the most exclusive clubs in America  is worth the price of the book.	2005-09-03

Stotesbury (PA) (Images of America)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Gilded Age Splendor	This is a very interesting book on one of the grandest estates ever to grace the American landscape.  The period photos alone are worth the price of the book, but the story of the house and its disgusting demise are facinating.  This truly was one of the greatest of the Gilded Age estates, ranking with San Simeon, Biltmore and Lynnewood Hall, the latter we hope does not meet the same fate as Whitemarsh.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with any interest in great residental architecture or just quite frankly a sence of history.  If you have an interest in Whitemarsh itself I would suggest also purchasing American Splendor, this book focuses on Horace Traumbaur, the architect of this great house and many others, including Lynnewood Hall.	2005-08-30

I really didn't know that much about these buildings nor the architects so this book gave me a real education, I came away more knowledged and very impressed. The attention to detail the architects employed in these buildings is amazing and the fact that so many are still extant is a tribute to the artistry and talent that went into designing and building them and obviously contempory wealthy apartment seekers appreciate these attributes or else we all know these buildings would have been pulled down long ago, just like so many of the Gilded Age mansions they replaced.  This publishing house puts out such finely crafted books and this one does not disappoint, I highly recommend it.	2005-08-30

If you are interested in architecture at all, I recommend you pick up this book, Chicago is so steaped in architecture history and this is a good guide to the best examples.	2005-08-24

Many people don't realize all the wonderful buildings Cleveland has in her environs.  This guide hits on all the famous buildings, I enjoyed this guide, but I wish it were more thorough, I felt areas like Shaker Heights and Cleveland Heights got short shrift and they both have some wonderful residental architecture, especially Shaker Heights, descriptions are not enough, the guide needed pictures of these homes and schools.  I hope in the revised edition that the authors give more time to Clevelands affluent suburbs, they are a treasure trove of residental architecture.  Having said that I still highly recommend the guide to anyone interested in architecture, you will be surprised at what Cleveland has to offer, I know I was.	2005-08-24

I don't want to give up too much of the story, otherwise why read it, I'll just say that Harry finds love and an important character dies, by whose hand will surprise you and not surprise you, though I have a suspecion that the character may not really be dead, I think Ms. Rowling may be engaging in a bit of smoke and mirrors, we shall see, I look forward to finding out in the seventh and final book.  I always tell people, that you really have to look at the series as really one book in seven vol., some are better than others and everyone has their favorite, but they are all fun reads.  If you have enjoyed the series thus far, I can't imagine you not enjoying this book on some level, it may not be The Goblet of Fire, but it is action packed and it does move the story along, I highly recommend it, but don't make it your first Harry Potter book, read them in order, you will enjoy this book more, I assure you.  I also highly recommend the audio book, in c.d. or cassette, Jim Vale, the narrator, does an amazing job, he really makes the book come alive.	2005-08-10

The history of the home is very interesting and the text highly informative.  The Rockefeller's are synonomous with money, so you expect their estate to me magnificent, Kykuit does not disappoint, the images of the estate inside and out are very well turned out.  The estate is amazing in that it is huge, but somehow warm, it's not bombastic like the Vanderbilt palaces, it is somehow more human.  There is an understated elegance about the mansion, I mean understated by the lofty heights of the great American rich of course.  This is a nice testement to an amazing home and an equally amazing family.  In the true philanthropic tradition of John D. Rockefeller II, the house is in a trust for all to enjoy.

The characters are so well written, especially Brick and the undercurrent of the story is always swirling.  Secrets are bubbling up and everyone is fighting over something real or perceived.  It is a wonderful character study and you really can't put it down.  Even though the 50's movie with Taylor and Newman was wonderful, the play is so much better.

The mother Amanda, is classic, she imbodies the faded Southern Belle who can't quite come to grips with where life has left her.  I find Tom very easy to relate to, his wanted to get out, just to go anywhere, but the guilt of leaving his mother and sister is overwhelming.  It is said that Tennessee Williams based this play loosely on his life and it shows in the writing, you really feel like the dialog is stream of conscience. This play will touch every reader on some level and if it does not it probably means the reader has either lived a very charmed life or is too young to relate.  I highly recommend it.	2005-06-08

This book really captures L.A. and this is a city that begs to be photographed from the air because of all the wonderful buildings hidden behind huge fences and lush landscape.  This is without question one of his best books, it really is a joy to look through.  I have the older edition, but have seen the newer book and it only adds a few new pictures of buildings built since the book was first published in the early 90's; such as the Getty.  I was expecting more new pictures, since the publisher makes big deal about it being revised, I even thought I might buy it if it was that different, but there are like five new pictures out of about 160 original and like I said before they where not even taken by Cameron.  These pictures are well done, but are not by Cameron himself, he is alas over 90 and retired.  Either printing is a five star book I assure you.  I  highly recommend all of his books they are all wonderful in their own way, but this truly is one of his best works.	2005-05-18

Vegas is not the most beautiful place Cameron has photographed, I mean in all fairness who can compete with Carmel, Yosemite, and San Francisco, but he makes Vegas sparkle with his fantastic eye.  Vegas is a city that photographs well, the desert colors really respond to the camera, one can't help but be amazed at all the construction and I'm from Houston!  As a man from the west, it was fiting that Vegas should be Cameron's last hurrah, I mean if this city does not symbolize todays Sunbelt I don't know what does.  I may have not chosen this city to be his last, but that does not dampen my appreciation of his talent and the beauty of his photography.  I highly recommend this book as I do all of his wonderful photo essays.	2005-05-18

I think the photos in this book are just amazing and they are so vivid and captivating.  Chicago is such a beautiful city and from the air you understand what great civic planning can do for a city.  Cameron hits all the most important areas and does not miss anything; from Oak Park to Lake Forest, for Aurora to the Miracle Mile, it's all here.  This is one of his best books and he does Chicago proud.  I recommend this book as I do all of his wonderful books, if you love great photography you will have to have them all, but this is a great place to start.	2005-05-16

Robert Cameron is such a talent, I own all of his books, they are all amazing in their own way.

This book is amazing, San Francisco never looked better and that is really saying something.  Mr. Carmeron is from the Bay Area so he saves some of his best work for this book, which has been gloriously updated.  The views and angles he gets are nothing short of spectacular.  San Francisco is one of the worlds most beautiful cities and it's really saying something when a book can guild the lilly like this one.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a love for this great city or just a love of great photography.	2005-05-16

Robert Carerons work is the benchmark of this genre, he is the master and this book really demonstrates this in full.  Let's face it it's not hard to make Hawaii look good in photographs, but what makes Cameron so great is that he can make something that has been photographed so many times look like something totally new, that is the mark a great photographer.  I am a huge fan of his work and this book is an exemplary example; he does Hawaii a great service.  I highly recommend this to anyone with an appreication of photography, this man was special.	2005-05-16

Granted it's hard to make Washington look bad, it's is so wonderfully laid out, but in this book she never looked better.  Though the pictures are from the early 80's, most of the momuments are present and the city is timeless anyway.  Mr. Carmeron is such a talent and the angles he gets are just amazing.  If you love Washington, or just like great photography quite frankly, you will love this book.	2005-05-16

I recommend this book to anyone with an interst in this beautiful city or just an interest in great photography in general, you won't be disappointed.	2005-05-16

Although it is limited to the time period 1936-86, it is very interested non the less.  The period photos are very well put together and the text scholarly.  I have always loved Dallas and this book really captures the city.  Because of its explosive growth Dallas has many important buildings in every conceivable style, covering all the important asthetic changes in architecture in the 50 years this book covers.  It's really quite facinating to read how these buildings got built and why.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in civic power and vision, all of which Dallas architecture exeplifies.	2005-05-13

The houses are so beautiful and the photographs so vivid.  Louisiana is perhaps the most blessed with homes from the old south and this book does them such a great service.  It's nothing short of amazing that so many of them have survived, it's a testement to the quality of the builders, mostly slaves, the cypress wood used so often and benign neglect.  Thank God these wonderful homes where not burned during the Civil War or torn down by short sighted developers.  It's really lucky for us that this part of Louisiana has been virtually asleep for 150 years, but in the last 30 years it has awaken like a Pheonix and these houses have been restored and cared for, I am so grateful to Mr. Gleason for having created this book and for the preservationists that saved the homes themselves.  I have visited many of these grand plantations and you can't help but be in awe of the beauty and saddened at the same time about the cruel institution that created them.  I most appreciate the homes that have maintained their slave quarters, everyone should have to see the way these people lived, it was not all zippidy do da zippidy aye, I assure you...one must always view the historic south through this prism to understand the struggle to overcome.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with a love for all things beautiful.	2005-05-13

Having said that I still highly recommend this book, even an average Cameron is better than the best of anyone else, he is that good.  Though the book is a bit dated it still is worth having in your collection I assure you, it still has photos of things I have never seen photoed elsewhere.	2005-05-13

Maybe I expected too much from this book, I don't know, but though I liked it very much indeed, it did not blow me away.  Something was missing, I think it was Versailles and Fountainbleau and maybe Sceaux.  I just thought most of the greatest chateaux where absent, although I loved the section on Vaux le Vicomte, now that is a spectacular chateaux by anyones definition; maybe the most beautiful in France...Louis XIV thought so.  The photographs where first rate and I did enjoy the book, I just wanted more.  Having said that I do recommend it to anyone who in interested in this subject; for those it really is a book worth owning.	2005-05-13

It's amazing how much history this small island has to tell.  I grew up going to Galveston and have always loved the city, but I had no idea it had this much history.  You really won't be able to put this book down, every section is more intersting than the previous.  Mr. Carwright has always known how to weave a tale.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in facinating history, written in a compelling way.  Be aware that after you read this book you will have the most incredible desire to visit this wonderful island.  Galveston is truly a treasure and I always tell anyone visiting the Houston area to make it their top priority.	2005-05-13

Though the book was first published in the 80's the pictures still resonate.  New Orleans went through a building boom during this time so most of it's best modern buildings are represented along with all the historic ones.  I loved the views of the Quarter, you just never see it this way, even from the top of the Marriott.  I really appreciated the fact that Mr. Gleason also included pictures of significant buildings around New Orleans, like Oak Alley and the Mississippi Delta.  New Orleans is one of those cities that just cries to be photographed, like San Francisco and New York City and this book does a wonderful job of giving her her do.  I recommend this book to anyone with an appreciation of great photography and one of a kind places.	2005-05-13

This book does the city such a service, it is spectacular and photographs just amazing.  Mr. Cameron is such a singular talent and he does it hanging out of a helicopter.  This book really captures the city and lets the viewer see the hidden New York, that very few see.  I love the photos of Central Park, you have no idea what an oasis it is until you see it from high above.  Some photos are in summer some are in winter and you get to see the city in all its various incarnations.  Mr. Cameron also includes some vintage photos to let the viewer see how much the city has changed.  I only wish that Mr. Careron had been able to photograph my city of Houston, she would have welcomed him with opened arms.  I highly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed.	2005-05-13

I love Paris and this book lets you see the hidden gardens and the wonderful lay out of this singular city.  Paris has NEVER looked so good, and eventhough this book was first published in the late 80's the photographs still capture the present city, after all Paris, thank heaven, does not change that much, that is a big part of her charm.  Though she ages she never really shows her age, she is truly eternal.  I highly recommend this book, it is just quite frankly unparalleled.	2005-05-13

Hays Town, took the native French Louisiana architecture and made it his own.  His homes are so inviting and are so rich to the eye.  I have been in several of his homes and each is special in their own way.  The photographs in this book are just supurb and the text is very informative.  Mr. Town really knows how to create a setting and his homes look like they have been there forever, like this is what nature intended.

I am a huge fan of his work and even though, I would not say this is his best work, it is still better than the best work of Cornwell or Connelly.  David Lindsey is a master of the thriller, I know of no writer today who can pace a thriller better than Lindsey, I can assure you that if you read this book you will want to read all his other books, he is consistantly good, which is notable for a writer of thrillers.  I have read all of his books and periodically go back and reread them.  I enjoy most of Patrica Cornwell's Scarpetta books and I like Grisham and Connelly, but Lindsey is in another league altogether.  If you love the thriller and relish great writing then you will not be disappointed in this book.  Though I recommend all of Mr. Lindsey's books, my favorites are A Cold Mind, Mercy, Requiem for a Glass Heart, In the Lake of the Moon, and Face of the Assassin.	2005-05-02

The book mostly focuses on the building of the skyscraper in the 30's and my only qualm with the book is the lack of current photos of the building, but that is a minor critisism and should not reflect on the overall excellent quality of the book.  The Chrysler Building is a pinnacle of Art Deco style and I love it.  The history of the building is so interesting and story of the spire is such a quenticential New York moment.  I recomend this book to anyone who loves the romance of the skyscraper and this one is magical.	2005-05-02

It deals with detective Stuart Heydon, one of Lindseys best protagonists.  The story is facinating and the villian is vintage Lindsey.  The story is chilling and the material graphic to say the least.  Lindsey always captures Houston so well in his books and this one is no exception, you can almost feel the humidity sticking to your skin.  I think this is one on his strongest books, it is well paced and well researched, like all of Lindsey's books.  It is a taunt thriller and you will not be able to put it down, I just read it again recently and it was just as bone chilling.	2005-04-28

I always loved Philip Johnson, the man and the work.  He was such a brutally honest person and his work really defined the skylines of Houston and Dallas.  I love the Transco, now Williams Tower, and his Republic Bank Building in Houston, they are soaring and harken back to the great Art Deco Buildings of the 20's and 30's.  This book does of fine job of research and gets the right mix of photos and text, though you can never have too many photos for my taste.  Houston definitely got the better buildings in Texas, Johnson always admitted that, but his buildings in Dallas are pure Johnson and are wonderful in their own way.  This book is a nice tribute to Johnson and though he was blessed with a long, highly adverturous life, he will be missed.	2005-04-28

I have known people who just have not gotten this book at all and some like me who it has effected for a lifetime, but even the people who didn't get it didn't feel like reading it was a waste of their time.

I know people who didn't like this book at all and I have known people that loved it, but I really don't know of anyone who didn't get something out of the book, it really is a male coming of age story and as such it hit me on some level.  I always recommend it to people because the ones that get it really get something out of it and the ones that don't didn't waste much time anyway..it's a short book.  I highly recommend it, if you get it it will stay with you forever.	2005-04-28

I am always trying to turn on people to his writing.  Let me say I thought this was one of his best books, it has the classic Lindsey prose and the great locations maticulously researched.  I found Paul Bern a facinating protagonist and the villian was vintage Lindsey.  I always love when he sets his books in Mexico City, he really has a feel for the city, you can almost smell the decay.  The story has a fast pace and I read it over a weekend, I just could not wait to see what happened to Paul Bern.  The only qualm I have is that I wish Lindsey would set his books back in Houston, instead of Austin, I mean I love Austin, but Houston has a real soul that Austin will never have.  If you enjoy reading fast paced, well written thillers, then you will love this book.	2005-04-27

Mr. Lindsey perfectly captures Houston and his writing style is fluid and engrossing.  Palma is one of his best protagonists and the story is riviting.  I must say that I am a huge fan of Mr. Lindsey's work and have read all of his books, they are all well written and researched, but this is unquestionably one of his best.  I hesitated writing a review because 32 is plenty, but the most current review is so shocking, ONE star, and that someone found it helpful was revolting to me.  If you love thrillers and appreciate well written and fast paced books then you will LOVE this book, I have read Da Vinci code and all of Patricia Cornwell books as well as David Baldacci, but Lindsey is the best, once you read one of his books you will have to read the rest..he is that good.  I also recommend In the Lake of the Moon, Requiem for a Glass Heart, and A Cold Mind, but frankly all of his books are consistantly good.  I am so thankful that someone turned him me on to him while at U.T., it's a shame that he does not get a wider audience, but I'm always trying to correct that descepency.	2005-04-25

The pictures though well executed are not as vivid as I expected, I don't know if it's because of the paper used or the exposer, they just don't pop vividly off the page like you often see in books of this price but they are well done and are clear.  Having said that the villas covered are great and the picture ARE well executed, all the major areas of Italy are covered and the villas chosen are the best.  I really did like this book, it's just that I have owned such fine books, I expect alot, but I do highly recomment the book to anyone interested the subject, it is a fine book and I thoroughly enjoyed it.	2005-04-22

The images are amazing, the colors so vivid and vibrant.  I didn't know what to expect so I was blown away at the craftsmanship of this book, the binding is fine and the cloth cover is refined.  Everything you ever wanted to know about Bernini is covered here, there is no need to have another book on the subject, this is the holy grail of books on Bernini.  If you love fine Baroque architecture and fine craftsmanship in your books as well as amazing pictures and informative text then you will love this book.  As you can tell I was impressed, and for me that's saying alot.	2005-04-22

The pictures are vivid and the book quality is of the highest caliber.  The other reviewer was correct in noting that the reader has to been careful with this book, the pages are so heavy that it will pull from the binding if you are not careful when positioning the book.  I have always had a facination with Versailles and this book really captures the chateaux, it makes you feel like you are stolling the gardens and taking in the sumptuous wonders of the palace. Unlike other books on Versailles this one is complete, it covers everything and in striking detail.  I urge anyone with any interest in Versailles to buy this book, even used at 200 U.S., it is a bargain.  I assure you you will not be disappointed in this book.	2005-04-15

It does a wonderful job of giving scholarly text and extensive photographs of the structures.  The book leaves no doubt that Mr. Barnstone was a great admiror of this singular architect.  The book gives floor plans as well has historical archival text on homes.  He gives most weight and time to Mr. Staubs most famous building, most notable Bayou Bend.  The reader marvels at Mr. Staubs command of different mediums and styles.  His buildings, no matter how stylistically diffent, all have his touch of understated elegance.  This book is a must have for anyone who admires great residental architecture.  Mr. Staub was one of the great residental architects and Houston was lucky to call him her own.	2005-04-13

It provides a quick overview of some the the most famous Renaissance buildings such as, St. Peter's and Fontainbleau.  It is not an indepth book, but the text is informitive, if not exactly scholarly, I mean that in no disrespect to the author, I realize this is meant to be a quick overview and so many buildings are coverd it would be virtually impossible to give each of them comprehensive coverage.  The photographs are first rate and the pictures are vivid.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a book that is quality and that covers all the famous buildings of the Renaissance.  If you are looking for deep text maybe this is not right for you, but for most this will all they need and be a wonderful addition to there book collection.	2005-04-09

I was blown away by the quality of the photography, the reader actually feels like they are in the jungle amid the ruins of Angkor.  I have never visited Angkor Wat and probably never will, but after experiencing this book, I feel somehow that I have been there.  The quality of the book is superior and the book even comes in a wonderful case.  The publisher should be congradulated, it's a luxurious book.  Some books are extremely expensive and you wonder why, I can assure you, you will not ask that about this one.  If you have any interest in this subject or just like to own beautiful things I urge you to purchase this book, it will be a jewel in your book collection	2005-04-09

It is nothing short of amazing that Mr. Williams had the career he had.  He is a master of the California Regency, the style just exudes grandeur.  This book does a fine job of hitting on his most well know buildings and gives a nice cross reference of his work. The text is very interesting because it comes from Ms. Hudson, his grand daughter and the pictures are quite vivid.  I'm sure Mr. Williams would be proud that she has honored him in this way.  Taking nothing away from Ms. Hudson, I would love to see UCLA do a series on his work with an architecture scholar, but for now this is a very nice tribute to a singular architect.	2005-04-08

It gives you a good idea of what the pieces of this style are going for at the time and what is selling and what is not..again at the time of the auction.  The book does a nice job, better than most Millers guides, of giving many examples of different pieces of furniture in each style.  The biggest problem with these guides are that they are a bit expensive and obviously go out of date quickly.  Once they are more than a few years old they are really not of much use, other than to admire the beautiful furniture in the pictures.  Having said that the book is well put together and the pictures are quite nice, though I wish more where in color.	2005-04-08

Mr. Sack is one of the most knowledgable experts on this subject.  This book shows you the subtle differences in what makes a piece good and what makes a piece great.  Having his experise on this subject is invaluable if you have any interest in searching for early American antique furniture.  He learned from his father, who had an amazing eye, and Mr. Sack shows you what he has learned.  He is reknowned as an expert in the field of Early American Furniture.  It is a shame that this book is out of print and that one must spend a great deal for a used copy, but this book is worth every penny.

The text is highly informative and every major building is shown inside and out.  Many of the buildings are just breathtaking and I was blown away at all the styles represented, though I must confess I will always be partial to the hotel de Rothschild in France, to think my country owns such a treasure. Again, I just can't say enough about the photographs, they are obviously done with a trained eye and a real talent.  I have been looking for a book on this subject for some time and just was not impressed with what I had found, that is until I came across this wonderful book.

His structures are so clean and modern, I love the use of glass and light.  Honestly, if I where fabulously wealthy he would be the first person I called to build my house, and I would pay him anything.  Nobody designs a house like Mr. Meier and this book does a grand job of illustrating that point.. the photographs are first rate and the colors are sharp.  The latter is so important when doing a book on his work because the play of light on white is what his buidings are all about.  All of his best houses before 97 are covered and they are all given the royal treatment.  If you love clean crisp modern design then buy this wonderful book on this master architects work, you won't be disappointed.	2005-04-07

I liked the fact that the book had a blend of photographs of the exterior as well as the interior, too often only the interior gets photographed.  The book itself is of the highest quality and it has a luxurious feel, it's quite heavy and well bound.  I did expect to see Westminister Abbey and St. Peter's, but I suppose they didn't fit the authors strict definition of Cathedral, still I would have liked to have seen them included, but that's a small disappointment in an otherwise fine book.	2005-04-05

This book is 700 pages so you can imagine how thorough it is, it just goes on and on, page after page, one building more amazing than than the other.  I have always loved Paris and the city photographs so well, much like Rome.  This book is a steal at this price and that is saying something, I am surprised they can print it at this price and make money, the paper used is of the highest quality and that's what makes the pictures pop.  The book goes inside buildings that are rarely photographed, that's why it is such a joy to find that the photographer is excellent and that the quality of the book is fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Paris and appreciates books of this quality.	2005-04-05

I always admired his buildings, I liked his take on Mediteranian Architecture and his buildings had wonderful function.  Mark Lemmon was the foremost architect of the grand Texas church, when a wealthy congregation needed a new signature church they called Mark Lemmon, he is famous across the state for these amazing buildings.  His buildings where functional above all, but elegant.  I have walked through the SMU campus many times and always stop to admire his wonderful take on Georgian architecture.  This book does a wonderful job of capturing his buildings and the man.  The photos are vivid and crisp and the text scholarly, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Mark Lemmon deserves to be in the realm of great Texas architects along side John Staub and O'Neil Ford.  Thank you Mr. Brettell for a wonderful book on a most deserving subject	2005-03-23

The story behind this book is as facinating as the book itself.  It is just amazing to get two of the greatest photographers of the 20th century to collaborate of any book, much less one of such an obsure subject.  This book is a treasure and I urge anyone who loves photography to buy it whether you care about Galveston or not.  I do care about Galveston and I love the fact that this book galvanized the city to save its unique history.  As you look at the pictures in this book remember this is the Galveston that WAS, not that IS.  Many of these dacaying building have been saved and restored.  Galveston is a testament to what perservation and generous philanthropy can do for a city.  The city is experiencing a renaissance and this book had a great deal to do with it, it makes me so proud for this American treasure.	2005-03-22

The pictures are very good, though I do agree with the reviewer that stated the book needed more exterior photos, allthough I still would not have rated it a five star book, but definitely four and a half. In order to have gotten five stars the author would have need to have focused more on the great palaces and much more time on Potsdam and Bavaria.  This is a subject that needed and got a fine assessment.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in European architecture at it's best.	2005-03-15

The history of the building is as facinating as the structure itself.  It's the story of one man's, Huey Long, cult of personality and of a state coming into the 20th century 30 years late.  The building illustrates the history of Louisiana and the perserverance of this great state during the Depression.  It's a symbol of power and hope.  I have toured this building and I love it, it is Art Deco at its zenith.  The historical photos in this book are very interesting and the author does a commendable job of using the photos to perfectly augement the text.  I do wish, however, that he had included more photos of the full structure in all its majesty, but that is a small qualm and overall I highly recommend the book.  This book is a tribute to Louisiana and the structure itself a tribute to a people who even at their lowest point could create amazing things.  These great Art Deco structures, like the Louisiana Capitol, the Empire State Building, and the Hoover Dam show the American spirit at it's most vibrant and it lifts me up just to think about it.	2005-03-04

The effort by the British Raj to build Imperial New Delhi from scratch in two decades is a tribute to British imperial power at its zenith.  Whether you think it was wrong or right of the Raj to brand its imperial power on India forever, in the form of Western classical meets Indian mogul, you can't help but be blown away by the scope and beauty of Imperial Delhi. Anyone who has any, I mean any, interest in this subject should buy this book, they will not be disappointed, it is a facinating story of the ultimate colonial power and its effect on this amazing country called India.

This book is exhaustive in it's research on the buildings built by the British Raj.  The pictures of georgian and victorian buildings in the middle  of India is a weird juxtaposition.  It's a shame many have been left to decay, I can understand the Indian peoples confliction over the British Raj, but there is no doubt that good and bad the British left a rich history in India and it should be saved.  Some of these buildings are absolutely amazing.  I was disappointed that the book did not show the great buildings of New Deli, like the Viceroy's House and the Secretariat buildings, I was surprised at their omission.  At any rate, this is a fine book on a fascinating subject.	2005-02-02

I must stipulate that the photos used are quite good.  Note to publisher the cover photo, with Adler's name vertically imbosed cheapened the look of the book, although the back photo was excellent.  If you are fan of Adler I recommend this book, but with slight reservations, look at my other reviews to find truely great books on American Master Architects.  I'm a tenacious reviewer, but if I say a book is great, I'll bet you will agree.

Anyone who thinks Delano and Aldrich, or dare I say McKim, Mead, and White designed the most lavish Guilded age mansions need, no must, buy this book.  Horace Traumbaur would give Richard Morris Hunt a run for his money, as a Beaux Art master.  I had no idea he designed so many beautiful mansions, I knew he was a great architect and I knew about his masterpiece Whitemarsh and it's disgusting demise, but I didn't grasp the depth of his range nor the breath of his work.  I thank the authors for honoring him with this great book and as an admirer of his work I am thrilled to get the chance to own such a great book.  The quality of this book is superb and the photos are outstanding.  I can only hope that this book saves the rest of his buildings in particular the Widener mansion, let's not allow it to meet the same fate as Whitemarsh, who needs another bland housing tract, what we need are reminders of special talent and amazing buildings, mansions like this will never be built again.  The Guilded Age is long over and the talented masons and the great architects who honored the past are all gone, replaced by the likes of Frank Gehry and Rem Koolhaus.	2005-01-14

I would have liked to have seen more pictures and better quality in the photos.  The research is top notch and I enjoyed reading the text, but I expected more and for some reason that I can't quite put my finger on I was a bit disappointed.  I usually go back to my books over and over again to paruse the pictures and scan the text, but I have not found myself doing that with this book and I don't know exactly why, because I normally love these kinds of books.  Anyway, it is a fine book and maybe it's just me.	2005-01-14

I am an avid reader of Cornwell, or I guess I should say was.  I only recently started reading her again.  I was just bored with Cornwell's Scarpetta series after Black Notice, I mean a Werewolf!!!!, but this book is better, actually quite good.  Of her last three novels this is the strongest and Trace the weakest, which is most regrettable sence it is her most recent.  I do get tired of the seven degrees of Scarpetta, I mean is everyone she ever meets interconnected somehow, some of it is believeable, but much is just plain ridiculous.  Having said that I still consider the Scarpetta series to be one of the best and encourage anyone who loves thrillers to read it from start to finish or at least to Point of Origin.  If you are bored with Cornwell, try David Lindsey, now he IS the best.	2005-01-13

I am sorry to say that it's somewhat of a disappointment, I expected a better researched book and also one that including some current color pictures of the surviving estates.  The authors of the book on architects Delano and Aldrich did a wonderful job of combining great archival B&W photos with rich currect color pictures.  The archival photos in this book are wonderful, but you finish the book wondering what the surviving estates look like today and in color, I really do hope the authors take this criticism to heart and make vol. II a five star book, they are not that far from it with this book and quite frankly the subject deserves it.	2005-01-10

Mr. Sterns preface at the beginning of the book is astute.  This book is a perfect combination of archival and current photos and the history of the buildings are well researched and thorough.  The color photos are vivid and well executed and the archival photos are well chosen.  So many of these books just give you archival photos and are not researched as well as one would hope.  This book is a blueprint for how these type of books should be presented.  This beautiful book is well worth the money and at these prices that's high praise indeed.	2005-01-10

The pictures chosen are perfect and the authors do a commendable job with the research.  The book gives an exhaustive cross section of Mr. Popes work and one gets a real appreciation of his talent.  The book publisher deserves credit for creating such a finely made book, one never doubts they are perusing an expensive book.  The only qualm I have with the book is that they didn't do like the authors of the book on Delano and Aldrich and include some fine current color pictures to compliment the wonderful vintage B&W photos, that would have made it perfect, but this is close enough.  Congradulations to the authors for this fine piece of work.	2005-01-10

I have that edition, but I also enjoyed this edition, I really appreciated the updates and the additional homes.  Ms. Randall cares about these homes and the history of the Gold Coast.  This book is well researched and the photos are quite interesting.  I realize that the criticism by the other amazon critics are not a criticism of this book, just the editor for the quality, but one star really gives people the wrong immpression of this classic book.  Honestly the quality of this book is not that bad and the book itself is a classic of its genre.  Give it a try or at least buy a pre owned older copy, you won't be disappointed.	2005-01-10

Some of these reviews give up the entire book; some are as long as the book itself.  Anyway, this is an average Scarpetta book, it's taunt and I liked the Louisiana locations.  This is a better book than Cornwell's current book Trace.  If you have not read Cornwell's Scarpetta books before, I urge you to start at the beginning, they are the better books, plus the series builds on itself.	2005-01-07

I am familiar with St. Charles and this book captures the avenue well; I can almost hear the streetcar.  The author did a very good job of selecting the houses represented in this book.  I only wish that more pictures where taken of the exterior of the homes.  The photography is well done, though the photography in the book Classic New Orleans is superior.  I suggest if you are interested in this subject you buy this book and Classic New Orleans, they fit perfect together; like crawfish and new potatoes.	2004-12-28

She really has not written a good book since Point of Origin.  It seems Ms. Cornwell  has gotten tired of Scarpetta and as a reader I am exhausted as well.  I won't bore you with a synopsis of the book, but take my word for it, this is not her best work.  As an avid reader of her Scarpetta books, I can honestly say I don't care about these characters anymore, especially Lucy; please Patrica kill her off.  This character is so obtuse, who can believe she is a genius; and a hot one at that.  What's next Lucy as President-Super Model-Bill Gates; GIVE ME A BREAK, and  am I the only one that shivers at the thought that Marino could be a composite of policeman Cornwell knew?  How revolting.  Maybe it's time for Cornwell to give up Scarpetta, she obviously doesn't like her anymore and I'm not sure she likes her readers much either... the feeling is mutual.	2004-12-28

The photos are so vivid.  My only qualm is that there are not more pictures of the exterior of the houses, that would have made it a five star book.  If you enjoy books beautifully presenting gilded age grandure then you should consider adding this to your collection.	2004-12-18

I expecially appreicated that the house was most always pictured with the description. The historical B&W photos are great.  The book also lets you know if the house is still in extant, that is KEY in a book of this kind.  I was amazed at how many survived and saddened at those that didn't.  Your heart will pound as you look down to read if the beautiful house you are looking at survived.  I think it is sad that so many know about the great houses of Newport and the Hudson River Valley, but forget about the greatest collection of all: The Gold Coast of Long Island.  I hope if this book does nothing else,it makes developers think for a second before tearing down history.  We will never see houses in America like this again.  Job well done, indeed.	2004-12-17

This book is not prefect, the font is poor and it is overpriced at 90.00 U.S.  I think it is well worth 50.00 U.S., but for 90.00 I expect more pages and better quality.  I was expecting the Holy Grail when I ordered this book, the reviews where hailing this as the burning bush; what I got was a good book, a very good book on tea caddies and box's, but not the end all be all.  If you love tea caddies and such you will immediately enjoy this book, but the sticker shock may take a bit longer to get over.	2004-11-19

It's fast paced and is taunt.  I have read very few writers who can describe places like Lindsey, you can almost smell the dank Mexico City air.  If you love thrillers and enjoy great writing then you will love Lindsey and this book.  Other books from David Lindsey I recommend:  A Cold Mind, In the Lake of the Moon, Body of  Truth, and Requiem for a Glass Heart.	2004-09-15
