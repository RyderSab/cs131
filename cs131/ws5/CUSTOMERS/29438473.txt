This book has widely been cited as one readers' favorite Joseph Murphy books.  The point cannot be over emphasized that persistence is the key with Dr. Murphy's techniques. If these laws are scientific and utterly impersonal (like the laws of gravity or electricity for instance), if they worked for others, they MUST work for you.<br /><br />I found the example on pg.117 helpful and you may wish to read and re-read it.<br /><br />Dr. Murphy also dispels myths that many of us who have at some point been affected by traditional religious beliefs, have been asked to accept: that there is a bartering system between you and the Almighty. You give X amount of days in church, go without a nice cold, light beer (not excess mind you) for long enough, etc., etc. and you get your prayers answered. As Dr. Murphy asserts, it is ALWAYS done unto us as we believe--only as you believe, that is the ONLY condition for answered prayers, that and NOTHING else.<br /><br />Finally, a most inspiring story for those who truly believe that the universe is without limits is as follows:<br /><br />(Pg. 197)<br /><br />Many people are very decisive and categorical in their statements that<br /><br />a man cannot grow a leg or finger, if missing. Let me quote from \\"He<br /><br />Heals Today\\" by Elsie H.Salmon*:<br /><br />Mildred was three years old when brought to me.<br /><br />She was born without a left hand.  The arm<br /><br />ended in a point no bigger than the size<br /><br />of an index finger well above the wrist.<br /><br />Elsie Salmon said to the parents of this child in response to their<br /><br />question: \\"If we believe that all things are possible to God, then God<br /><br />can grow this hand.\\"<br /><br />Within a month the point at the end of the<br /><br />deformed arm had doubled in size and was quite<br /><br />plump, whereupon the father now seeing the<br /><br />remarkable development, said, \\"Anything can happen\\".<br /><br />The following month there was a formation which<br /><br />looked like a thumb and which, at the time,<br /><br />we thought was a thumb.  About three months<br /><br />following we found that this was not a thumb<br /><br />at all but that the growth was the whole hand<br /><br />at the end of the arm and this was unfolding<br /><br />like a flower before our eyes.<br /><br />She concludes by saying that those who were skeptical are now<br /><br />accepting it as an established fact.  Perhaps we should take a lesson<br /><br />from the rhinoceros.  When you take off his horns and cut out the<br /><br />roots, it grows new horns. Cut the legs off a crab, and it grows new<br /><br />legs.  If a man believed that he could grow a finder, leg, or any<br /><br />organ, he could experience his belief.<br /><br />\\"With God all things are possible.\\" (Matthew 19:26)<br /><br />*Author James Limited, The Drift, Evesham, Worcs., England; sixth<br /><br />edition, 1959.<br /><br />I hope you are encouraged to purchase this book for your library and find this review useful.

Do you enjoy visiting museums but when you are not with your curator pal, you are utterly clueless as to how to optimize your visit? Fortunately, this book can help!<br /><br />Art for Dummies is written in a very easily digestible style by the former director of the Met in New York and former editor of Connoisseur magazine. It essentially lays out the different art periods, highlights those works of art that are considered most famous and of the greatest importance (note: rather subjective as always...) and even goes so far as to display these works in color pictures. If you are a burgeoning art philomath, you may find this book a good tool for moving up the learning curve.<br /><br />There are also good tips on how to get the most out of a museum visit and a helpful bibliography with online material. After reading this book one will easily be able to answer the following queries without a dumbfounded look on one's face:<br /><br />-What are your three favorite works of art and by whom?<br />-What are the 10 best museums in the world?<br />-Where is Rousseau's Sleeping Gypsy housed?<br />-Where was the Venus of Willendorf found?<br />-What work of art did the first woman pharaoh build?<br /><br />A special nonlocal thanks to the friend that purchased this book for me!	2005-07-12

Here is a fellow that quantifiably and qualifiedly demonstrates that authenticity and a service ethos are what count: Ferrazzi purportedly has 10,000 contacts, was named the youngest partner ever at Deloitte Consulting and also a Global Leader of Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum. He appears to be an extremely ethical, socially-conscious individual.<br /><br />I am aware of his intriguing work exploring the intersection between spirituality and successful business and hope to see a forthcoming book on this topic. Actually, Keith, if you happen to be reading this now, allow me to have you as my guest here in Stockholm, I would be happy to receive a missive from you. Professionals in Europe very much need the benefit of your expertise, particularly those from more reserved social cultures.<br /><br />I could be helpful with any work related to the Nordic Region, Africa, urban entertainment & media and various philanthropic/social-interest causes, particularly technological development in developing countries, access to education and corporate accountability.<br /><br />If any reader knows Keith, feel free to pass this message along.<br /><br />In conclusion, I applaud the theme that one should focus on making the pie bigger (so to speak) so that everyone gets a larger slice instead of trying to grab a bigger slice of the pie through individualistic opportunism.  In other words, let us help each other create MORE opportunities rather than simply compete for the small batch of opportunities that are only saliently available.<br /><br />Here is to everyone's success!<br /><br />Best to all,<br />Shola Abidoye<br />sabidoyeATalumDOTswarthmoreDOTedu<br /><br />______________________________________<br />Where the needs of the world and your talents meet, there lies your true profession.<br />-Aristotle	2005-04-08

If one is familiar with Chopra's former works, one is likely to have come across some discussion of the ideas discussed in the book.<br /><br />Essentially, this piece speaks of the importance of clearly focusing the mind on an intention/desire (NB: writing down one's intention, goal, etc. is crucial), releasing the desire to the natural laws of the cosmos, then awaiting the arrival of coincidences as an indication of the unfolding of one's desires.<br /><br />Chapters 1, 4,5, 9 and 11 are particularly intriguing and interesting.  I rate the book 4 stars (instead of 5) because I found some chapters (the aforementioned ones) more useful than others. The other books I have read by the author have been extremely useful from cover to cover. Having said that however, it may well be the case that after applying some of the knowledge from the chapters I found the most relevant, I may well realize that other portions of the book are of equal usefulness--such is what can occur through growth and development.

The former, is wondrously defined by the warm, cultured and ennobled-through-character kin that surround him during his formative years in the American south. The unconditional love and support of his tightly-woven family foster his ability to achieve grand accomplishments.  The latter world, the outer world of ultra high fashion, where the bon vivant and gadabout crowd reign supreme, is one where his artistic talents and creative aptitude are encouraged and appreciated; this oft-pretentious, sometimes imperious world of glamour, glitz and visual luster, is one where he thrives while still holding true to his spirituality, family and humanity.<br /><br />Mssr. Talley's life is indelibly and immeasurably shaped by the presence of his generous, compassionate, selfless and benevolent grandmother, Madam Bennie Francis Davis. Though a woman of modest material means, her inbred sense of style and priceless integrity, virtue and honor are courtly and regal in every sense.  Madam Davis' parentage, along with that of Mssr. Talley's father and support from extended family, enable A.L.T. to leave the warm bosom of the south and further his education at Brown University where he earns a graduate degree in French studies.<br /><br />Eventually moving to New York, Mssr. Talley meets and apprentices with Mrs. Diana Vreeland, the ne plus ultra of his burgeoning career at the time.  With professional and moral support and encouragement from this unique and impressive woman, it is not long before he lands a job with the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of fashion publications, Vogue magazine.  His bi-continental career ensues, he meets and befriends intriguing, impressive, multitudinously-diverse individuals and, in sum, moves from fashion glory to glory.<br /><br />The crux of this memoir and most enriching insights, boldly reveal to the reader the importance of authenticity, of staying loyal to one's heritage, and of never sacrificing one's core values in the midst of the fashion world's artifice. In this case (and very fittingly), the person Mssr. Talley is revealed to be on the inside is superbly reflected on the outside--the best and the brightest of high society and high fashion are drawn to him and he counts many till today as loyal, genuine friends, admirers and compatriots in work and in life.  How best to describe Talley? Cultured. Authentic. Passionate about his work. Unabashedly spiritual. Unquestionably creative and talented. Generous. Worthy of the success and respect he has earned. For someone whose interest in fashion is at most an afterthought, I learned a great deal from this piece.

On pg. 45 the author presents factors that each of his respondees have rated as being of relative importance to meeting one's personal career goals.<br /><br />I particularly like his idea that one's likelihood of achieving above average net worth will exponentially increase if one focuses on services vs. products.  The fact is that just as only 10% of Americans hold graduate degrees, only 1% will reach millionaire status.  In other words, it is an elite status that is gained through careful planning and execution not \\"luck\\".  The author stresses that one's relationships with others not just schooling, job, etc. play a critical role as well.  For instance, some researchers purport that one's yearly income will be the average of his/her 10 closest friends.<br /><br />In sum, this book is an interesting guide to substantiate what many of us have been told time and time again about what it takes to acquire, maintain or increase one's financial liquidity.  Further, I am a huge fan of the author's relentless attempts to distinguish between being wealthy vs. being rich.  Wealth truly is having total control of the most valuable, finite and irreplaceable asset of all: time.  Through owning assets that generate passive income however, you truly are wealthy in that you have the resources + the TIME to do whatever you desire.  On the other hand the income-rich, exchange their time for money. With only 24 hours a day, you are destined to be behind in this game. Sadly, many highly-educated people of whom I am lucky to be one of (or unlucky--depending on the little known negative correlation between amount of education one has and likelihood of becoming a billionaire), fall into the trap of chasing prestige jobs/careers as opposed to wealth building lines of work that are sometimes less prestigious.<br /><br />Finally, I suggest a careful reading of chapter 6.  Here, the author completes an insightful analysis of the issue of partner selection and its impact on one's financial life. According to the author, it literally does \\"pay\\" to marry an \\"unselfsh, caring, forgiving, patient, understanding, disciplined and virtuous\\" individual (pg. 246).<br /><br />I hope you find this commentary useful.Finally, I suggest a careful reading of chapter 6.

I have to agree with several other readers.  Sir Branson articulates himself to be a born entrepreneur, risk-taker (sometimes calculated, other times not), iconoclastic and, perhaps subtlely, family-centered.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his vivid descriptions of his variegated love life and only tangential discussion of his personal life philosophy and philanthropic work, leaves one saying  \\"He's an  exciting, flamboyant character; but not someone who will be remembered in the manner of a Carnegie or Rockefeller\\".<br /><br />Whenever I read and review biographies, I try to encapsulate key takeaways--relevant teaching points--for  future benefit. I present them below in the hope that they might be beneficial to someone:<br /><br />-A tight knit social circle of family and friends is critical; the wealthier and more successful one becomes, the tighter and more important this circle should be<br /><br />-JVs (Joint Ventures) can be a valuable way of expeditiously creating new business lines in an unfamiliar industry or environment<br /><br />-European banks are far more conservative/less risk-taking than American ones (rather well known)<br /><br />-Sub-units managed as individual corporate entities are an effective way of hedging risk and building employee buy-in<br /><br />-Put employees first (vs. shareholders) and profits to owners/shareholders will dutifully follow<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased that I read this book because I enjoy Virgin's services (particularly Virgin Airways).  Branson's adeptness at branding is unquestionable.  However, I came away with the feeling one often has after completing a meal at a much hyped restaurant yet not having had one's appetite pleasurably satisfied.	2004-09-17

This book is a story that demonstrates the complexity of the human experience.  It provides an insightful and attention-grabbing look into the innerworkings of the American urban experience, highlighting the impact of poverty, unemployment, hopelessness, failure and also perseverence, vision, triumph and success.<br />I decided to read this book because I saw an interview with DMX that revealed an interesting person who was a loyal and devoted husband and father, a man with depth and a unique message to tell.<br />While I think the substance of this book is definitely of 5 star calibre, the overall delivery (particularly the language), does not reflect the highly articulate personality that I saw when DMX was interviewed.  On the one hand I can understand that the &quot;keep it real&quot; language was used in order to engage readers that may not normally read on a regular basis, I feel like this strategy has some shortcomings.  DMX's story deserves to be heard by many and I feel that some readers may be turned off by the language in the book.  In the middle of the book, I was tempted to discontinue reading, having reached the point of saturation with regard to the same old four letter words, hyphenated expletives, etc.  However, I continued through and was rewarded by the poetic, powerful and thought-provoking ending of the book.<br />So, that said, I say read this book and digest the fruits of this satisfying life story (and the accompanying lyrics).  I hope that more such stories get told and if you are left feeling angry about some of the things that are done to DMX (and that he does as well) and frustrated by the shortfalls of the American experience/dream for many young Americans, suggest the book to a friend.<br />I hope you find this commentary useful ;).....	2004-07-19

Why is that? Well, based on my experience, there are but a few fundamental principles, laws, truths, etc. that lead to success in whatever arena of life one focuses on. That said, every teacher (or in this case, author) has a unique view point on these ideals or provides a different way of looking at these principles/laws/truths that speaks to readers in a more enlightening way.<br />In my opinion, I believe that this book does a solid job of providing a tangible and actionable framework for designing on paper (not just mentally) a strategy for creating success in all the critical areas of life - health, wealth, love/relationships and true exprssion. Since the average person's most challenginig issue surrounds money (understandably so when 3 out of the 6 billion other people on our planet live on $2 or less a day), most advice books tend to focus on money. Similarly, we are fed ideas which lead the average person to believe that if they were just in a position to buy anything they desired materially, happiness would be automatic.<br />There's a larger picture here: we can never really feel 100% fulfilled unless all areas of our lives are in their ideal state. John Assaraf's book therefore 1)does a convincing job of articulating the importance of &quot;total success&quot; (described above) as a more apt life goal 2)provides an easily understood framework for analysis of these issues and 3)provides a tangible action plan for achieve total success.<br />I sincerely believe that any individual who reads this book (along with those listed below) and that has passionate desire and a dedicated heart--coupled with the willingness to apply the principles outlined not just read about them--WILL achieve their goals. Less than two years ago, I moved from the USA to pursue my goals abroad (after more than 6 years of thinking, wondering, etc.).

If you come from the kind of background where spirituality, an appreciation for the nonphysical side of life, etc. was not encouraged,  I think this is a great introduction to a practical development of intuition skills.<br />One of the reasons why this book is good is because it demonstrates that intuition is a skill we all have equal access to--both men AND women--though it may be more highly developed in some rather than others. However, like any skill it has to be fine-tuned in order to make more advantageous use of it in our daily lives and regular undertakings.<br />If following your intuition is already a major practice in your life and you are looking for a more advanced work on the subject as opposed to an introduction, there may be books that are more helpful to you than this one.  That said, I bought this book because the author's other book Creative Visualization was  so well regarded and I therefore figured this book would be valuable as  well. The author has a very accessible writing style and by and large, this is an easy, useful read.	2004-07-12

The author explains the fundamental teachings of metaphysics:<br />That we all have the power to create whatsoever we desire when we &quot;believe that we receive&quot; when we pray.<br />Understanding how to use the laws of the mind, through creative visualization and through the power of faith--believing an idea with absolute 100% convinction--is unerring solution to all of  life's obstacles and challenges.<br />After completing this book, I read a book from the author's bibliography that is well known on this subject and is highly recommended--The Magic of Believing by Claude M. Bristol. Therefore, the book was helpful in more than one way.<br />I would recommending reading the above mentioned book by Mr. Bristol as well as Power of Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy for a more exhaustive understanding of the subject.  Sometimes it takes reading different authors' discussion of a subject to really believe that these ideas are not only true, but are accepted and used by many.<br />One thing that I did not necessarily find too helpful was the sligthly eccentric instructions in several chapters of the book.  However the insights found in chapters 1-6, 18 and 25-26 warrant my purchase in the end.<br />Read this book, apply the principle then share the knowledge to help others.	2004-07-12

I think each reader can take out several different interesting tidbits for rumination from this book.<br /><br />I personally found interesting the good detail outlining the historical links and relationships between European and American Universities.<br /><br />Yes it is common knowlege that John Harvard went to Cambridge and that the residence halls at the Ivies are modeled after the traditions of Oxbridge (Oxford + Cambridge).  However,  other less well known facts were quite interestingly presented.<br /><br />My little brother in law school saw an interview with the author on the Today Show, picked up the book afterwards, read it and then recommended it to me.<br /><br />I am sure there are probably other books out there that discuss the topic of secret societies at elite American academic institutions. That said, the writing was easy to digest and the black and white pictures included in the book added color (so to speak) to the entire piece.	2004-07-12

Ironically, a six figure education is not likely to have given you the real knowledge of self outlined in this and similar books.<br /><br /> I recommend reading and applying the principles in this book with the short book &quot;It Works&quot; by RJH and &quot;Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot; by Joseph Murphy. If you are interested in interacting with others who have applied these principles, do a search on yahoo groups using the title of the books and read some success stories.<br /><br /> Try it and see!	2004-07-12

I bought this book at a church bookstore, ironic huh? Having been fortunate enough to attend elite academic institutions in America and Europe, I can say without a doubt that the principles espoused by  Mr. Hill's writing are by far more valuable than much of what I learned in a formal academic environment--this is real education....SELF education, i.e. knowledge of Self.<br /><br />Jim Carrey reputedly read this book while  working a low wage job before becoming famous, applied the fundamentals and the rest, as we say is history.<br /><br />I always like to point out interesting teaching points from books and here are a few:<br /><br />**\\"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve\\"<br /><br />**\\"There are no limitations to the mind EXCEPT those we acknowledge\\"<br /><br />**\\"Both poverty and riches are the offspring of thought\\"<br /><br />One of my greatest ambitions is to actualize the level of success I envision for myself and in doing so, be in a position where I can mentor others about the principles of success such as those. Mssr. Hill  teaches.  One of the first things I shall do is give this book away in order to complete the cycle of giving and receiving.<br /><br />I also recommend reading this book along side Joseph Murphy's book \\"Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" and Claude M. Bristol's \\"The Magic of Believing\\" along with \\"It Works\\" by RJH.  These books along with Think & Grow Rich can truly  enable you to achieve  whatever you desire not only financially but in health, relationships, peace of mind and true expression--true wealth.<br /><br />I have personally achieved some wonderful results through the application of these principles and look forward to applying  them even further for higher and higher levels of achievement.

Does this sound counter to what you learned in \\"Sunday School\\", mosque or the synagogue? Or, does this sound possibly arrogant and blasphemous? Well it is not!<br /><br />Mr. Murphy's books are far from being sacrilegious (as some conservative critics suggest); they are are beautifully doxological and deeply empowering.<br /><br />There are so many wonderful teaching points in this book I will try to outline a few of the most thought-provoking ones:<br /><br />1) We answer our own prayers through turning to the spiritual power within  us all; when you understand that whatever you consciously believe is true is brought to pass through the power of the subconscious mind, you can take all of the guess work out of prayer<br /><br />2) God is not some old guy in the sky that will punish you if you are bad or with whom you can bargain or that requires you to sacrifice the wholesome things in life you desire. As JM teaches, the only thing any of us \\"owe\\" God is , \\"recognition, praise and thanksgiving\\".<br /><br />3) The meaning of the word \\"Christ\\" is actually a title meaning the anointed one. In fact, when we are able to fully comprehend and  apply the truth that thoughts are things and whatever we feel to be true is expressed in our life (pg. 237) we gain access to the priceless wisdom of Jesus' (and other great prophets') teachings.<br /><br />This is a book for a person who firmly believes in a spiritual, nonphysical higher power but whose good common sense has led  him/her to question  literal interpretations of the Bible and has heretofore been left disillusioned with traditional religious teachings.<br /><br />A good test of the efficacy of any theory is the impact it has on one's life. I am a firm believer that anyone who applies the spiritual truths that are simple yet power and described in this work (as well as several other works of the author) shall see for themselves.<br /><br />I also recommend reading this book along side the author's most popular work, \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\".  I am writing this view because as JM teaches, whatever you think and feel you create. I feel fortunate to have been led to his teachings and I am writing this review to encourage  others interested in the fundamental truths of life to  read and profit from his works as well.  This is not altruism therefore, but a way to create more experiences in my life that lead to me feeling more grateful and fortunate (smiles).<br /><br />The only thing more I might add is that when you see the tangible results of applying the principles in this book, you share the knowledge with others.cause as JM teaches, whatever you think and feel you create.

I have read extensively on the principles that successful,  powerful people both past and present have used to access power.  The greatest people of all time have realized that unlike what Mr. Greene suggests, real, sustainable power comes from within--it cannot be had through the manipulation of external conditions, i.e. effects not causes.  The most powerful people (some who used their power for good, others for not so good), accessed the power we all have WITHIN us.<br /><br />My analysis has demonstrated to me that the only people who are able to become very powerful in business, politics and socially and yet still have excellent health, great relationships and above all PEACE OF MIND, accessed the power within.<br /><br />I believe that all those who want to rise to positions of power and authority (and enjoy the associated benefits of such) yet still maintain good friendships, good marriages, have good health and peace of mind, should spend more time accessing the power within because this is the only power than enables one to \\"have it all\\".<br /><br />This book was good because it enables those who live by certain ethical principles to identify and protect themselves against those ideas that are discussed (and  very likely used) by many readers of this book.<br /><br />I would recommend reading Joseph Murphy's book Power of The Subconscious Mind for a better understanding of the true source of power. For those who are truly ready, read the book that Napoleon Hill and other Silicon Valley billionaires have put to work--The Master Key System by Charles Haanel.

This book is a great read no matter what religion (if any) you  belong to.  Honestly, the fundamental laws that lead to success in the game of life along all lines--health, wealth, peace of mind, love/relationships and true expression--are very simple but few of us are lucky to happen upon them.  Then, for those who do, applying these laws consistently is something that even fewer of us do.<br /><br />My favorite nugget of wisdom from this book is the following:<br />\\"That which doesn't multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor receiving.\\" (pg. 30)<br /><br />I try to keep this insightful idea in mind when I consider not only finanacial and material concerns but my relationships and interactions with people as well.<br /><br />I have read 3 of the author's books and this one is thus far my favorite.	2004-07-12

Books	5	6	8	N	N	Buy for Content not Award winning writing....	To put it effectively yet succinctly, I recommend this book more for the core content as opposed to the Nobel, Pulitzer, etc. manner of prose.<br />The worth of this book can be found in its ability to condense the major success strategies of a number  of well known individuals all in one book.  Not only does it give useful, practical and actionable information, it also gives interesting biographical details as well. I have come to believe that understanding the mental workings of successful people and their history--not just what others say about them--is a critical factor in duplicating success. As one sage aptly stated, &quot;Experience  is the most expensive teacher&quot;.  In my analysis of successful people the world over, one thing is certain: they study the success of others and duplicate the strategies that work, augmenting them when necessary.<br />Bill Gates reputedly reads approx. 120 books a year on various subjects (as an example).<br />One of the most thought-provoking powerful ideas I got from this book is something that a mentor of Jim Rohn told him early in his career &quot;become a millionaire (or billionaire) for what it makes of you to achieve it&quot;.<br />There is a very strong moral/spiritual theme running through this book as well. Essentially it demonstrates that it is possible to acquire wealth in a manner than doesn't make one suffer in other areas of one's life such as health, peace of mind, love/relationships or true expression (doing what you really love to do).  This is perhaps the biggest plus of the books.<br />I bought and read a copy of this book for myself and purchased another for a friend as well in order to complete the circle of giving and receiving (which according to those profiled in the book is a, if not THE, major factor in overall success).<br />Lastly, I noticed that this book was self-published by the authors which says alot about their own business acumen.  They cut out the middle man (a big publishing house) and the fact that they were able to promote this book and have it do so well is  more evidence that this book is worth owning.e fact that they were able to promote this book and have it do so well is  more evidence that this book is worth owning.	2004-07-12

The traditional interpretations of Jesus the Christ's teachings have turned thinking individuals into opponents of the Bible.  Well, Mr. Fox's work (I read the original version published in the 1930's) provides some acceptable insights.<br />While Mr. Fox's works are slightly skewed in his references  to how the &quot;European race&quot; has civilized the rest of the world, brought order  where there is chaos, etc., etc., there is a solid message here.<br />His analysis the Sermon on the  Mount (Mathew 5, 6 and 7  in the Bible), demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that the mind is the builder of all that is in the life of man and woman.<br />If you are a Christian fundamentalist who has decided not to question literal, traditional interpretations of the Bible in any way, this book is not for you.  However, if you find that traditional, mainstream Christianity doesn't fit into your views of life and yet you still believe in the fundamental usefulness of the core teachings of Christianity, I offer that you do the following:<br />1) Read this book with an open mind<br />2) Test some the principles in your own life, applying the principles to the resolution of problems that have heretofore not been solved using other methods<br />3) See what happens.<br />Every New Thought book I review I also mention the works of Dr. Joseph Murphy's (&quot;The Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot; is  his most famous) because they have had such an impact on my life as well the lives of countless others.

I really liked the wholesome story line and as a 20-something woman who still manages to find admirable a woman with principles and good character, the heroine, Faith, was easy to like.<br /><br />I also appreciate that the author is willing to take on a heavy  subject which actually makes the story more realistic and gives it more depth.  The male character was also easy to like as well.<br /><br />That said, it was slightly disappointing to have a seemingly well-traveled, talented story-teller (Mme. Steel), lazily employ such 18th century-esque descriptions of Africa.  I had to check the front of the book for the copyright; it read 2002 not 1722.  I mean come on Ms. Steel, \\"the natives\\" this, the \\"natives\\" that, at one point I felt some trepidation she might describe the Zambians as having tails, grunting and shouting \\"Ooga Booga\\".<br /><br />Ms. Steel writes, I am assuming, for an international audience so it was disappointeing to read this portion of her book.  I am not sure if such stereotyping is the result of unrecognized subconscious beliefs or what.<br /><br />If she can describe the lovely rooms of Claridge's in London with a fair degree of accuracy, it shouldn't be that much of an intellectual leap to do her research on the other geographic locales of her book.<br /><br />All and all however, being the relatively open-minded person that I try to be, I will say that this was a good read.  In light of all of the \\"morals in the trash\\" entertainment we have these days like the Bachelor, The Bachelorette, For Love or Money, etc., etc., grabbing a cup of herbal tea and turning the pages of this book certain makes for more pleasing entertainment.	2004-06-30

If you do not often read books concerning personal development (aka self-help), this book is a good place to start.  In brief, I think it is helpful  to list some of the most intriguing/valuable portions of this book:<br />1) Most people spend more time planning their vacations each year than they do their lives (says the author).  In other words, everything that is worth anything happens because of good planning.  A billion dollar business doesn't just happen by luck or happenstance does it? Well neither does the life of your dreams. It takes dedicated, practical planning in the major areas of one's life to get to the ideal state--in health, wealth, peace of mind, love/relationships and true expression (i.e. doing exactly what you want to do).<br />2) The way you use your mind determines whether or not you succeed-know the functions of the conscious and subconscious mind and how to use them effectively.  One's mind is the most precious resource one has. It's like a computer; when you learn how to work it more efficiently, you extract more value from it.<br />3) Learn the laws of life.  Life can be strain-free, happy and very orderly if you know the rules--some call these rules natural law (as the author does), some call them universal law.  Once you know the rules and how to apply them, the sky (or higher) is the limit.<br />4) Take advantage of both your physical and nonphysical (i.e. spiritual and mental) resources and you will assuredly  &quot;have it all&quot;.  In fact, it appears that every study of those who have achieved successful living in all areas of one's life points to the fact that the physical/nonphysical combined elements is the only way to achieve maximum success.  <br />It seems clear that all those who have been able to achieve all they desire in all the major areas of their life realized that the nonphysical component is the key.<br />I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because I feel that the author's work could have been more impactful had he spent more time on the most critical element in his equation for success--the mind, particularly one's subconscious, and how to use it.  Perhaps in later works he shall do so.  I would probably buy his next work if it included real stories of people who used is particular method for success achievement and were able to &quot;have it all&quot;.<br />I like the fact that he also demonstrates that money and happiness/good character, etc. are not an either/or trade-off.  We can all have great relationships, wonderful friends, careers love and good character, WITH all the money we can ever use and then some.<br />I am also impressed that he gives of his money and time to nonprofits and charities.<br />I wish the author continued success and am happy that he does indeed appear to &quot;Have It All&quot;.<br />I would recommend reading this book along with Joseph Murphy's book &quot;The Power of Your Subconscious Mind&quot; for maximum impact.	2004-06-30
