I mean, look at the title. I know it's very creative, but does it sound like the type of book I'd like to read? No. Well, I'm glad I did read the book and the rest of the series. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants books are 3 of the best books I've ever read. I even made my mother read them, and she loved them as much - if not more - as I did.  <br /> <br />Anne Brashares really delves deeply into each girl. They are not simply characters to make the book happen, but characters with feelings, emotions and problems that we can all relate to. They each have real relationships with their mothers, they are loyal and devoted to each other, and they have problems which they deal with honestly. Things like that in a book can't help but make it a good read, don't you think? <br /> <br />I certainly hope that Anne Bashares writes more for the series because I will be first on line to by them! <br /> <br />Happy reading!	2005-09-04

The entire time I was reading it I had a huge headache, but I just couldn't put it down! I don't know what people are talking about in other reviews about not being able to relate to the characters. They are so relatable! It is such a disturbing feeling to have your past dictate your future telling you who to love and who to hate and what to do with your life. The conflicts that Kaitlyn goes through... how to tell and when to tell Bram who she really is, and seeing both sides of the story and the reactions about what happened that fateful night is what makes it so relatable. How many of us have done something that caused a big misunderstanding and resulted in us living with regret for the rest of our lives? But in this book, not only will you read a heartwarming story about two people who's lives are dictated by their past, but you will learn how to follow your dreams and leave regret and whatever else is preventing you from following them behind. <br /> <br />If you cry during this book, don't worry. It just shows that you did actually relate to the characters and connect with them... which is probably going to happen. Enjoy! <br />	2005-04-27

I read it 4 times.  <br /> <br />'The Princess and the Pauper' is a modern day twist on the story 'The Prince and the Pauper'. Carina is the 16 year old princess of a country called Vineland. On a tour in California, she meets her American look-alike, Julia. For $10,000, Julia agrees to switch places with Carina for one day in order for Carina to go to a rock concert and meet her online boyfriend Ribbit. Everything went perfectly, until Carina finds herself on a bus halfway to Arizona, and Julia finds herself being jetted off to Vineland.  <br /> <br />Once you read this book you'll understand why I read it 4 times. It's extremely well written and you won't be able to pull your eyes away from it until you finish. So go to your local library or bookstore and get the book... you won't regret it!	2004-11-07

It was just a waste of time. I'll tell you why I read it.. I saw the movie \\"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\\", and was curious to know what happened next. Now, the movie was also a waste of time and money. The only thing good about it was the fact that Lindsay Lohan played in it, but that's besides the point. My Perfect Life has barely any plot and so un-realistic. Basicly the whole plot is Ella is nominated against her will by Lola (her best friend) to run for school presidency against the popular Carla. <br />The person I hated the most in this book, and who cause the book to be so bad was Carla. Carla's character is completely fake. No one, and I repeat, no one, is ever that mean and selfish. She is totally immune to anyone's feelings and just does what she wants and what's good for her. She even goes far enough to get Ella's mother to cater her rally. <br />Lola is out of the ordinary. She dresses like she's from a religious group in Aisa and acts like a, well, drama queen. Lola was the one who got Ella nominated to run for the presidency and she was also the one who organized the whole campain. <br />Even thought the book was written in first person with Ella as the narrator, she was barely in the book. Only in the end, but I'm not going to reveal what happens, :). Ella had a perfect life, with a perfect mother, father and house. But things happen and the story doesn't stay so true to the title.<br />This book is for tweens and even younger kids who enjoy reading about school and people like Carla. Don't bother giving this book as a gift because the thank you note won't be really be meant as a thank you.	2004-05-28

I've never read the first book in this series, but that really didn't matter. This book is so well written that I caught on in the first chapter. THE REAL DEAL: UNSCRIPTED is about a girl named Claire Marangello who is on a reality TV show, meaning she is being filmed 24/7. Not only that, she's also the star in a Broadway musical called Twentynothings. Her way hot co-star Jeb, who just so happens to be a very famous celebrity, takes an interest in her. The book is basicly about how she mantained (sp?) her relationship with Jeb and her half-sister Tina, who she didn't know existed until a few weeks earlier. <br />This book totally deserved the 5 star rating I gave it, which says a lot. Read this book and enjoy it, you'll be ever thankful you bought it or borrowed it. Happy reading!	2004-05-28

Of course, being that young I didn't really like or appreciate it and never really wanted to read the book. A few years later my sister bought the book which she read and really liked, but I still didn't want to read it. Just a few years ago I saw a play that my high school put on, A Little Princess, and I loved it! Right when I got home I started to read the book, and finished it by the next day. It's one of the best books I have ever read!<br />The book is about a little girl named Sara Crewe, who's father was a Captain in India. She is sent to Miss Minchin's bording school in England where she is surrounded in weath, friends and her big imagination. On her 11th birthday she learns something really sad... her father, the dearest person in the world to her, died due to brain fever & being cheated of all his money. Miss Minchin then makes Sara into a maid because she has no money left, and she has to sleep in the attic with all the mice and roaches...<br />There is so much more to the story than that so don't worry if I said to much. Don't do as I did, and read the book as soon as you finish reading this review, you won't be sorry! Oh, and by the way, once you finished reading this book, try some of the other books by Frances Hodgson Burnett, she rights tons of other really great books too!	2003-09-26

It's really funny, and also very well written. The book is about Samantha, (Sam for short), who is one of the most boring girls on the planet. Her older sister Lucy is the most popular girl in school and is really into fashion and boys. Her younger sister Rebecca is a certified genius and at 11 and 1/2 she's taking collage courses. Sam is just the boring girl in between, who is a lefty and thinks she has a twin who was never born. She also dyed her whole wardrobe black and doesn't have a boyfriend, (she happens to be in love with Lucy's). Then her life changes. She saves the President of the United States from and asassination attempt, becomes a national hero and is the teem ambassador of the UN.<br />The book is full of lists that Samantha writes such as Top Ten Reasons Samantha Madison Is In Deep Trouble, and at the end of the list she writes the number one reason she is in deep trouble, etc.<br />As I said before this book is one of my favorite books, and it's really funny and well written. I reccomend this book to all girls from age 12 and up.<br />Enjoy!!!	2003-06-19

The book is really long, 330 pages and 84 chapters, but it's totally worth it to spend the time reading it! The book is about The Eel Grass Girls, (who else), in their pursue to find out what is haunting the old haunted house of Captian Snow. They come across a wicked coven of witches, a strange coyote, cold winds in the house, and many more stange and mysteryious things.

And then that body disappears before anyone besides them could come and investigate. They decide to team up together and try to find out about this body and prove it was really there to other people, and they do much more than only that..<br />I will say it again: I LOVED this book.

When JK Rowling was given a chance to write two of Harry Potter's books, she jumped to the chance. The books are very short, but tons of information is crammed into them. The first book, Quiddich Through the Ages is talking about the history of the magical sport, Quiddich.. (how it started, what it formed from, etc). It's actually very interesting. The second book, Magical Beasts And Where To Find Them is a list from A-Z of all the magical beasts in the world, (there are a lot of them). After a while the book gets a little boring, so JK Rowling,who probably realized this, added in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's little notes commenting on the words, ideas, names, etc.<br />If you love Harry Potter, then this is a gr8 book for you.. Enjoy!!	2003-05-23

I have read a lot of Gail Carson Levine's books, and after Ella Enchanted, I like this one best. The book is about two princesses of the kingdom Bamarre. They are very different -- Princess Addie is fearful and shy; Princess Meryl is bold and brave. Meryl always wants to go on adventures, but Addie doesn't like it when she does. Addie makes Meyrl promise that she won't go on adventures until Addie gets married. Dispite their differences they mean the world to each other. Then Meryl is stricken with the worst sickness ever know --  The Grey Death. Addie, terrified and unprepared, goes on a quest to find the cure. She must battle many different monsters who are in her path. Plus, she has to get back in time to save Meyrl, who's life is dropping by the day...<br />I have to say that Gail Carson Levine really makes a fairy tale good! This book has scary, amusing, and even romantic parts. I reccomend this book to everyone who would like to read a really good fairy tale.	2003-05-14

I know a lot of people may think that the book Twins in the Tavern may not be such a good book, but I think it was. The book is about a boy named Taddy who was kidnapped by two men who robbed his house after his aunt and uncle died. He was forced to work in an inn called The Dog's Tail, where he mets Beatle, another kidnapped boy. Then Taddy (now called Toady), was hired to work in the a very rich house, where he sees a boy who looks exactly like him! Could this be the twin his uncle told him about?

When my teacher told us that we had to choose a book from her book list for our book reports, I had no idea what book to choose. After a while I finally chose this book, Eight Cousins. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down!!<br />The book is about the time when Rose Campbell's father died, and Rose went to live with her Aunt Peace and her Aunt Plenty , who lived in a big house on Aunt Hill, until her uncle, her legal guardian, came for her. When Rose arrived she was a very sickly & scared girl. Her aunts didn't know what to do with her, and she was surrounded by 7 loud and wild boy cousins. When her savior/guardian, Uncle Alec arrives, she puts her full trust into him, and he helps overcome her fears, & turns her into a very pretty and healthy child. It wasn't long before Rose was as happy, healthy and lively as any of her cousins.<br />Don't worry, I didn't give away the ending, (the back of the book tells even more than this)! As I said before, this is one of the best books I have ever read, (I even cried a little at the end!!!).<br />ENJOY!!!!!!	2003-04-09

A long time ago, the Furkins looked very different, they didn't have all the hair that covered their whole bodies except their faces, they wern't scared, rather they were very brave, and most of all, they lost their ability to vanish. Now they looked almost exactly like one of their greatest enemies: Mice. But they smelled like warm apricot jam. By telling this to the cat, the cat finnaly let them go. Then they came across a beautiul house. In the basement they found a barrel. It looked just like a Furkin's house should look. Inside they found an old Furkin. His house is filled with funiture made from wood, and eats only Furkin food. The big questions that Pudding and Muttle are wondering are: How does the old Furkin keep himself from being noticed by the human who lives in the house?

There are a lot of things we can learn from the book. Except an occasional swear word ( this is the reason I only gave the book 4 stars), It is a very good book.<br />The book is about a family who was very poor. Some of the very important characters are: Mama- who is a very smart person, who counts every penny papa (her husband) brings home from work. Katrien- one of Mama's daughters whose dream is to become a writer when she grows up. Lars, Christine, &amp; Dagmar- Mama's other children. Jenny, Sigrid, &amp; Trina- Mama's sisters.

It's the type of book that I can't put down. \\"Rusty\\" an English girl who was evacuated to America during World War II, comes back to England after 5 years to find everything in England has changed. Her mother doesn't even seem like her mother. Then she is sent to boarding school, and even has difficulties there. I reccomend this book to teenagers.	2002-04-09

I find that Cheaper by the Dozen is funny at some parts, like at the begining, and sad in other parts, like at the end. I liked how Dad orginized the house, and tried to save time. One time he made the kids solve large multiblication tables faster than a cauculator!!! It must be alot of fun living in a house with 6 sisters, and 6 brothers, a fat, time saving father, and a pretty, gentle mother. <br /> IT WAS A GREAT BOOK!!!	2002-03-03

The book is about a baby named Sophie who is left on the Larson's driveway. While living in the Larson's home, Sophie learns to talk, walk, dance, etc. The Larsons learn to love Sophie even if they know that Sophies mother will come and take her back home. The theme of the book is words, everything was just... words.<BR>It was incredible!	2002-03-03

At first I didn't want to read the book because most of my friends kept on talking about the scary parts in the book. But then I desided just to read the first chapter, and I was hooked!!!! (I normally am a big reader). My favorite book is the first. I really don't know how JK Rowling can write such good books, but she does!!!	2002-02-20
