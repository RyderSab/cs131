I came across this book while browsing in a bricks-and-mortar bookstore, and couldn't put it down.  I found the chapter on Muhammad and the founding of Islam quite enlightening, for example, and I thoroughly enjoyed the  brilliantly illustrated discussion of arabesques in Islamic art and  architecture. <br />However, I firmly believe the chapter on Islamic  mathematics (the work of mathematicians who lived under Islamic rule and  wrote in Arabic) is the one jewel that makes the book unique.   I would  love to find a book that expands that discussion further.   I was most  intrigued when I read that Arab mathematicians discovered key advances that  are usually credited to Viete and Descartes, centuries before these western  Europeans lived.  <br />Overall, an excellent--and unusually deep--coffee  table book, on a much neglected subject.	2000-05-21

As an earlier reviewer of this book pointed out, allowing the assumption of supernatural intervention into the scientific method would provide a haven for lazy scientists, and would only slow the progress of scientific  research.  Effective scientists can--and often do--believe in God.  They  just need to do that on their own time, so to speak, and not while they are  researching possible mechanisms for observed natural phenomena.  The  nineteenth-century physicist Michael Faraday is a very good example of  this.  The views that Phillip E. Johnson puts forth in this book are not.	2000-04-15

I agree with the reader from UK (5 April 2000) that Michael Behe has written a valuable book, in which he puts forward some thought-provoking ideas.  I also agree that modern biological science does not have a  complete explanation for the origins of life on this planet, and that we  may never reach that Holy Grail.  The development of life as we know it in  all its present rich diversity appears to have taken hundreds--perhaps  thousands--of millions of years, and both the physical record and our  ability to interpret it have large gaps in them.  Because of this, I agree  with both Michael Behe and the reader from the United Kingdom (UK) that  there certainly is--and probably will always be--room for considering the  hypothesis of intelligent design.  And I congratulate the reader from the  UK for writing an unusually clear favorable review of this book.  This page  could use more such reviews, if only to counterbalance the many  poorly-written reviews here that convey the false impression that  &quot;only ignorant rednecks seriously question the theory of  evolution&quot;.<br />However, I cannot agree that either Michael Behe's  arguments or the biochemical evidence are sufficient to rule out evolution  by natural selection as a viable scientific theory.  While it is certainly  nowhere near being a complete explanation (what theory is?), it has  inspired far too much fruitful research for it to be abandoned on the basis  of Behe's arguments.  <br />I also disagree firmly with those other reviewers  of this book who advocate teaching a literal reading of Genesis alongside  evolution by natural selection in high-school biology classes.  I  particularly oppose doing so in schools that receive any funds from local,  state or federal taxes in the US.  This will always be a separate issue  from the question of intelligent design that Behe's book addresses.   Evolution by natural selection is a well-established, productive biological  theory and a vital part of an American's secular education, but the study  of the sacred scriptures from the Judeo-Christian tradition is not.  Given  its history, any interpretation of the book of Genesis (literal, literary,  historical or hysterical) in this country is a religious exercise, to be  conducted individually or in a religious setting.  To clarify:  I do  consider the study of the Bible to be a key component in a Christian's  education, but I do not consider it to be an appropriate component in an  American high-school student's secular education.  <br />The religious and  political histories of most nations and empires show all too clearly the  dangers of mixing government funding and enforcement with religious beliefs  and practices.  This is nowhere more evident than in the horrors of  Europe's gruesome Thirty Years' War and the tragic English Civil War, both  of which took place in the 1600s.  Common folk from all over Europe  emigrated to England's colonies in North America to escape those conflicts  and their aftermath.  In writing and amending the US Constitution, those  colonists' descendants sought to prevent the ascendance of any one  religious group to power by insisting on a firm separation of church and  state in this country.  None of the recent books on Intelligent Design  Theory, including this one, have done anything to remove the need for this  vital separation.  <br />Science is not religion, and religion is not science.   Scientists can be Christians, and Christians can be scientists.  But  wrapping scientific-sounding arguments around a belief system that is  rooted in an interpretation of the book of Genesis does not change its  religious character.  Neither does trying to apply the label  &quot;religion&quot; to a scientific theory that says nothing either for  &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; against a belief in God do anything to change that  theory's value as a tool for serious biological research.  Exposure to the  theory belongs in our public school curriculum; study of thesacred  scripture belongs elsewhere.  <br />Michael Behe has written an intriguing and  thought-provoking argument.  But he has not overturned the fundamental  principle of separating church and state, which is as central to America's  way of government as Magna Carta is to Britain's.  Since--like me--he is  both a Catholic and a scientist in a predominantly Protestant and largely  non-scientist country, I can't imagine that he would want to.<br />I suspect  that most Americans who have studied English history in any depth will  agree with me.<br />&quot;Remember--Remember--the Fifth of November.&quot;	2000-04-08

Smith writes in his review of Johnson's book:  &quot;...The primary question he asks has not been addressed by any:  'What is the evidence that natural selection can or has the power to produce major  changes in morphology or from one species to another?'&quot;<br />There is  abundant evidence for this.  Please allow me to quote extensively, for  example, from an article entitled &quot;A Bug's Life:  The Study of  Metamorphosis&quot; in the Winter 2000 newsletter from the University of  Washington College of Arts and Sciences, which I received in the mail this  evening:<br />-----<br />&quot;You've spread out your picnic  blanket and are  about to feast on potato salad and fried chicken.  Then along come the  ants.  And bees.  And mosquitoes.<br />&quot;There's a reason why these pests  seem to be everywhere.  They are part of four insect groups--beetles,  bees/ants, moths/butterflies, and flies/mosquitoes--that make up more than  half of the world's known animal species.  The secret to their success?   Metamorphosis.<br />&quot;Metamorphosis is a process in which larval, pupal,  and adult stages differ greatly, allowing each to occupy a different  habitat and consume different food sources.  Now two University of  Washington zoology professors, the husband-and-wife team of James Truman  and Lynn Riddiford, are proposing a novel hypothesis for how metamorphosis  evolved.<br />&quot;The researchers believe that a change in hormonal function  during embryonic development led to the evolution of a unique larval stage,  an innovation that allowed a virtual population explosion among these  species in the last 250 million years.  'Metamorphosis really opened up  niches that weren't open to insects before that,' says  Riddiford.<br />&quot;The earliest insects, which strongly resembled today's  silverfish, lacked metamorphosis.  Their juveniles looked very much like  adults, minus functioning genitalia.  After the evolution of flight, more  advanced species--suchas cockroaches and grasshoppers--developed  incomplete metamorphosis.  Their immature stages still resembled the  adults, but in addition to lacking genitalia they bore wing buds that  transformed into functional wings during the molt to the adult  stage.<br />&quot;In contrast, the higher insects--species with complete  metamorphosis--spend their juvenile life as larvae that bear no resemblance  to the adults.  Truman and Riddiford explain that what allows them to  change from, say, a caterpillar into a butterfly, is the way a group of  insect hormones, juvenile hormones (JH), and ecdysteroids interact during  embryonic, laval, and pupal stages.<br />&quot;Juvenile hormones, not present  in other insects, suppress the development of adult structures.  These  hormones remain as the larva grows, then disappear to allow growth of  imaginal discs, which will give rise to specific adult structures.  A  complex interplay between JH and ecdysteroids then allows the larva to  progress to a pupa, and finally ecdysteroids alone drive the transformation  to adult.<br />&quot;Juvenile hormones play such an important role in the  embryonic and larval development of metamorphosing insects that they have  been used as the basis for insecticides.  For instance, JH mimics are used  to treat ponds where mosquitoes breed, thereby blocking their  metamorphosis.  Such treatment also prevents eggs from  hatching.<br />&quot;The four major insect groups with complete metamorphosis  all are thought to descend from a common ancestor, so it appears the  development of metamorphosis in the insect world has occurred only once.   'There are indications that another group, called thrips, has evolved  toward complete metamorphosis but so far has fallen short,' says  Truman.<br />&quot;In insects with complete metamorphosis, the lack of  competition between juveniles and adults for food is a major factor in  their success and diversification.  Adults can feed on one source, such as  nectar or blood, and only lay eggs when there is appropriate food for their  young, such as dung, carcasses, fruit, and other relatively temporary  sources.<br />&quot;Truman and Riddiford believe that metamorphosis will  provide a valuable model for researchers to understand the molecular basis  for how shifts in the timing of protein production can lead to the creation  of different body forms.  That, in turn, could shed greater light on how  life patterns have evolved.<br />&quot;'Any innovation that helps you generate  species that account for more than half of all living animals is not a  trivial innovation,' says Truman.&quot;<br />-----<br />The evidence for  macroevolution by means of natural selection is there.  You only need to be  willing to look for it patiently, as generations of research scientists  like Professors Truman and Riddiford have been.  This book's author Phillip  Johnson has shown himself unwilling to do so, for reasons that seem to have  little to do with logic, less to do with the rules of evidence, and even  less to do with the successful methods of empirical science.  <br />Caveat  lector.	2000-03-28

I have re-read this marvelous book several times now, and I love it.  I have found the informative local maps  (included as illustrations) to be particularly helpful, each time I've followed the Foxton story down the  centuries from before the Romans to our own time.<br />From the book  jacket:<br />&quot;The setting is the village of Foxton, in Cambridgeshire,  and the common stream is the story of its development from the first traces  of human settlement to the present day.  The common stream is also the  rivulet that runs through it--both ordinary in its appearance and enjoyed  by all--and yet again the common stream is that of the ordinary men and  women who in their countless thousands have trudged through life and then  departed from it, leaving no visible trace.<br />&quot;Rowland Parker spent  thirteen years with oral reminiscence, manor court rolls, land tax returns,  wills and archaeological excavation, and has found out more about the  history of Foxton than is known about any other village of like age in  England, or even in the rest of the world.&quot;<br />This is a delightful  book, rather like a lively dinner conversation with cheerful and  well-informed host.  Here is a sample, taken from his opening remarks in  the Introduction:<br />&quot;This is a true story with a triple theme.  It  tells firstly of a brook or stream, 'common' in the sense that it is but  one of a thousand such streams which spring from the folds of hills  everywhere, and especially in the chalklands of East Anglia.  This  particular stream rises a few miles to the south-east of Royston and  meanders gently on a mere ten-mile course to join the river Rhee.  In order  to find it today you would need a large-scale map, and you would need to  know exactly where to look for it, because the stream has no name, nor ever  had, other than 'Brook'.  Even the local inhabitants are for the most part  unaware of its existence.   ...Only the willows mark its course with any  real prominence, and even they, stricken by age and neglect, are fast  disappearing; for no one, it seems, every thinks of replanting a willow.   How can such a miserable stream. . . have significance enough to merit its  role as one of the principal threads in my story?<br />&quot;Part of its  significance lies in that very fact, that it &lt;&lt;is&gt;&gt; a symbol of  decay.  Part lies in the very distant past, long before that story begins,  when every spring of water and every stream born of those springs was the  object of veneration by groups of primitive men who knew, as surely and  instinctively as the birds and beasts still know, though most men have  forgotten, that the water of those springs and streams was Life itself. . .  .&quot;<br />One more brief example, selected at random from a later  chapter:<br />&quot;Nothing was ever thrown away if it could still be used,  but it would seem that decency forbade a man to dispose of his late wife's  clothes until he himself was dead.  Stephen Wells in 1566 left to his  sister Elizabeth 'the gowne which was my wyffes with the sylver pynnes and  silver howkes' and 'an owlde kyrtell of worsted which was my  wyffes'.&quot;<br />If you have any interest in the history of the common man,  you will love Rowland Parker's &lt;&lt;The Common Stream&gt;&gt;.	2000-03-12

I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the story veers into the reckless and bizarre toward the end.  This kept me from feeling the satisfaction of having read a truly great book of speculative fiction that  the high quality of the opening and middle chapters had led me to  anticipate.  After adroitly sidestepping many potential cliches and  stereotypes in developing the plot, the author tumbles into a couple of  obvious sandtraps in wrapping it up.  As I finished the book, I imagined  the author's editor phoning him while he was working out the direction of  the final chapters, and putting pressure on him to hurry it into print.   The result is three-quarters of a five-star book whose ending threatens to  give it feet of clay.  <br />I didn't like the ending much, but I still  consider &quot;Newton's Cannon&quot; to be a good read, well worth your  time and easily deserving the four stars I've given it.  I also agree with  the earlier reviewers who have noted with pleasure that Greg Keyes did his   alchemical homework well.  I especially enjoyed the  &quot;aetherschreiber&quot; device, the masterfully-sketched underpinnings  for its plausibility, and its pivotal role in developing the main plot.  I  would have preferred to see the story continue further along that  trajectory and avoid degenerating into fast-paced &quot;horse opera with  magick&quot; at the end.  In particular, omitting the alchemical pistols  would have helped the story a great deal.  Without them, the author might  have successfully resisted the temptation to turn the final confrontation  in London into an unsatisfying &quot;spy vs spy vs spy&quot; caricature  with overtones of Zane Grey.  The French portion of the ending was better,  but still leaned too heavily on Dumas for my taste.  <br />I did like the very  last paragraph, though.  It sent a chill up my spine as it detonated a  couple of subtle landmines that had been laid quite carefully in earlier  parts of the story.	2000-03-09

Having read this book, which does have its strengths in addition to its weaknesses, then read through all 215 of the readers' reviews, I was struck by the contrast between those who love it and those who point out its  weaknesses.  <br />By and large, those readers who have pointed out weaknesses  in Professor Behe's argument tend to proofread their comments carefully,  with the result that they leave fewer typos, misspellings and grammatical  usage errors in their reviews.  <br />In contrast, those who love this book  and see it as a spear into the chests of the hated evolutionists seem to  spend much less time looking over their comments and correcting any  spelling or usage errors that might undermine the reception of their  opinions.   <br />In my opinion, Professor Behe's book is well worth reading  for its lucid discussion of the current state of biochemical knowledge.  I  also believe that it needs to be read in conjunction with other books  written by (or with the help of) mainstream earth scientists, for the  reader to get a clear picture of current evolutionary theory and its  possibilities.  <br />Three books I've read recently that some may find  helpful for this are Peter Westbroek's 'Life as a Geological Force:   Dynamics of the Earth', E.

It shows what it;s really like aboard a nuc boat most of the time,  even on a spec op:  studying, qualifying, standing watch, performing  mountains of required preventive maintenance, keeping your temper in tight  spaces, standing watch some more, noticing patterns before they became  problems, fixing things that broke, going back on watch yet again, studying  to qualify for the next higherwatchstation on your off time, and just  generally tending to the part of the mission that is your job, so the ship  can do its job.  Most of it isn't at all glamorous, and almost all of it is  very hard work.  <br />I'm not at all surprised that Petty Officer Dunham went  on to medical school and a successful career as a physician after he  finished his tour of sub duty.  The men in dungarees I served with stood  head and shoulders above most of my university classmates, and I watched  many of them go on to spectacular careers in civilian life.  If you read  this book carefully and think about it, you will understand why that was  so.  There is no other experience on this planet that rubs your nose in the  details of physical (and psychological) reality quite as thoroughly as  service on a nuc boat.  The only other experience that might come close is  service as an astronaut on an Apollo moon shot.<br />It's not for everybody.   But it's an unbeatable education.  Read this book to see why.	2000-01-10

If &quot;Darwinism&quot; is the  hypothesis that a single reproducing population can branch out into distinct, reproductively isolated populations (species, genus, phylum, and so on) through an evolutionary  process driven by natural selection among individually varying members of  the original population, then it is very much alive and well.  The  counter-proposal that design by an intelligent super-being might explain  the same physical evidence better is an intriguing one, but it is in its  infancy at this point, and it has by no means displaced the natural  selection hypothesis in the way that modern medical practices have replaced  bloodletting and charmed amulets in the treatment of physical illness.   Intelligent Design theorists still have a great deal of work to do, to  demonstrate their alternative hypothesis using solid physical evidence.	2000-01-04

This is a manual for aggressive evangelists, and you won't find much real science between its covers.  But that's not too surprising, given that it is published by Intervarsity Press.  Here is a sample of some other titles  from Intervarsity, to put it into an appropriate context:<br />- Eschatology  in Bible &amp; Theology:  Evangelical Essays at the Dawn of a New  Millenium<br />- How Wide the Divide?

For its value  in that study, it gets two stars.  <br />However, the reader who tries to use  this material to evangelize seniors and graduate students majoring in the  natural sciences is likely to be disappointed by the ease with which they  dispose of its arguments.  The arguments presented in this book are most  likely to appeal to those who have not successfully completed the first  three years of an accredited university curriculum in the natural sciences.   <br />Those most likely to be receptive to its message for emotional reasons  may well include college sophomores and juniors who have chosen to leave  the sciences after suffering through the grueling first two years of what  still passes for education in the sciences at many traditional colleges and  universities.  For more information on this related problem, I recommend  &lt;&lt;Talking About Leaving:  Why Undergraduates Leave the  Sciences&gt;&gt;, by Elaine Seymour and Nancy M. Hewitt.  Fortunately, many  forward-looking institutions of higher learning have begun to move away  from these lifeless methods of undergraduate science education.	1999-12-30

This is an eight-volume history of Africa that I can't recommend highly enough.  Patiently working my way through it over the course of several months did more to reduce my ignorance of human history than anything else  I have ever done.  I found several discussions particularly helpful:  <br />-  the physical evidence for human origins in Africa south of the Sahara <br />-  The colonization of Madagascar by voyagers from Malaysia, which introduced  the banana and several other valuable food crops into Africa in classical  times<br />- How the conquest of valley-dwelling, agricultural Hutu by  hilltop-dwelling, cattle-herding Tutsi serendipitously benefited both  cultures, since manure from Tutsi cattle enabled greater Hutu cultivation  of the banana<br />- How the Iron Age came to Africa south of the Sahara (this  was what led me to this work in the first place)<br />- The breadth and depth  of Arab learning and philosophy at the height of the Muslim empires during  Europe's Middle Ages<br />I did find the discussions of late-Christian Egypt  and Arab civilization more difficult to follow than the rest, because these  discussions make heavy use of italicized Egyptian and Arabic words without  bothering to explain them to the non-expert reader.  This forced me to keep  going  back and re-reading earlier passages as I figured out these terms'  likely meanings from their context in later passages.  <br />Overall, however,  this is a work I would love to have on my own bookshelf, if it weren't so  very costly to purchase.  The copy I read belongs to the King County  Library system.  (Seattle and Redmond, Washington, are the best-known  cities in King County.)	1999-12-27

I agree with the earlier reviewer who compared Johnson's work with Hobbes'.  <br />For more than 400 years, experimental scientists have been carefully investigating the way the world around us works, and finding  results that often surprise them--and astound the rest of us.  Time and  again, such discoveries have called earlier philosophers' most cherished  assumptions into question.  The list of discoverers whose work has been  received with incredulity--and even hostility--is very long.   It includes  Galileo, Kepler, Harvey, Boyle, Newton, Priestley, Hutton, Dalton,  Mendeleev, Pasteur, Darwin, Einstein, Heisenberg and Dirac, to name but a  few.  Others published their discoveries and died before the value of their  work was acknowledged and put to good use:  these include Copernicus,  Brahe, Carnot and Mendel.  <br />But in all of these cases, the ultimate test  of validity wasn't whether their philosophical assumptions were  &quot;correct&quot;, but whether their measurements and/or theories enabled  better prediction of observable phenomena.  Science deals with the  observable and the measurable, not with metaphysical definitions.	1999-12-25

I work in a small but growing software firm, and the push to add extraneous  features almost always comes from the sales and marketing folks.  The  developers who actually write the code would much rather keep squeezing the  bugs out of features we already have, so they can point to  &quot;bulletproof&quot; code they've written.  <br />Historically, marketing's  drive for media attention and management's quest for investor dollars has  overridden them, so that I have seen several poorly-thought-out features  added to our products solely for the purpose of issuing a press release.   We're beginning to change that now, making both our developers and our  customers much happier.	1999-12-24

If you want to see how genealogical research can produce compelling American history, this is the book to read.  For example, I grew up in Los Angeles, and had no appreciation for the  1850s' bloody struggle over the extension of slavery into territories  before they reached statehood until I read &lt;&lt;A Scattered  People&gt;&gt;.  I also didn't realize that southern Ohio (largely settled  by Virginians who came overland and down the Ohio River) and northern Ohio  (largely settled by New Englanders who came west via the Erie Canal and  Lake Erie) had such radically different views on slavery.   Before I read  &lt;&lt;A Scattered People&gt;&gt;, events such as the Compromise of 1850,  the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scott decision and John Brown's raid at  Harper's Ferry were just bland factoids I had memorized for tests in my  high-school American History class.  Now I see them as the tips of a huge  iceberg that tore into this country's fabric long before the greycoats  shelled Fort Sumter, and could well have sunk it.  This book puts the  disembodied events we studied with little interest and less understanding  in our American History textbooks into the context of individual families'  lives.  These families' struggles, their fateful decisions, their hopes for  their children, their successes and their disappointments all leap from  every page of this riveting study.  American history will never look the  same to me after this book.	1999-12-19

Phillip Johnson's arguments are worth reading, but only if you also read Charles Darwin's &lt;&lt;On the Origin of Species&gt;&gt; and Ernst Meyr's &lt;&lt;The Growth of Biological Thought&gt;&gt; carefully.  This will acquaint you with the additional physical evidence for evolution by natural selection that he omits.  I don't know why he ignores this persuasive evidence.  Ignorance of it is one possibility; unwillingness to confront it in his book could be another.  <br />The bottom line is that evolution by natural selection is a very useful model of the relationships among living creatures, well-supported by the available physical evidence.  The model is still incomplete, and there is plenty of room for additional investigation. However, while we can always speculate about possible supernatural causes for the phenomena we observe, that speculation will always be outside the realm of science, in which we make &lt;&lt;and test&gt;&gt; inferences from that which we can observe.  <br />On each page of Johnson's, Darwin's and further using observable physical evidence?  What physical phenomenon could I study carefully to test any of the arguments advanced here?  These are the questions that Darwin and Meyr asked themselves over and over in their long careers, and they are still the most relevant questions to ask ourselves today. <br />When we serve on a jury, we are prohibited from collecting our own additional information about the case being tried.  The jury's role is to reach a verdict solely on the basis of the admissible evidence presented by the attorneys for both sides.  But there are no such limitations on our role in the conflict that has arisen over the merits of evolution as a scientific theory.  We are free to investigate this question as deeply and as thoroughly as we choose, and to unearth as much new physical evidence as we are able to do.  I encourage everyone with an interest in this question to reach beyond the arguments presented in these books, andcontribute your own original research.  There's plenty of room for more investigators.	1999-12-17

But I do have a bone to pick with the term &quot;Afro-Phoenicians&quot; he chooses to use for the Phoenicians.  Isn't that a bit like saying &quot;Afro-Egyptians&quot;,  &quot;Arabo-Hebrews&quot; or &quot;Euro-Greeks&quot;?  Everything I've read  so far suggests that the Phoenicians were a Semitic people (or peoples) who  first rose to prominence in the vicinity of modern Palestine, and whose  exploration of the Mediterranean coast in competition with early Hellenic  Greece led to the founding of Carthage in North Africa.  In today's  American English, the prefix &quot;Afro-&quot; usually refers to  descendents of peoples native to Africa south of the Sahara, not to the  inhabitants of classical Mediterranean civilisations.  I agree that the  Phoenicians need to be given credit for the first known circumnavigation of  Africa, and for inspiring Prince Henry the Navigator's life work.  I also  agree that the proto-Polynesian colonisation of Madagascar via the Indian  Ocean, which brought the banana and other important food crops from  Southeast Asia to Africa south of the Sahara in classical times, needs to  be given more prominence in the history of great navigation feats.  It is  also quite possible that voyagers from sub-Saharan Africa could have  crossed the Atlantic long before the time of Columbus without our having  any record of such an achievement today.  Certainly the West Africans who  gained control of the slave ship carrying them to the Caribbean in the late  1830s showed the ability to navigate on the Atlantic using familiar  constellations at night.  That was part of the reason the ship ended up  making landfall in New England instead of Cuba.   However, the Egyptian,  Phoenician and Carthaginian seamen were innovators in a Mediterranean  tradition, and their achievements rightfully remain as the heritage of  today's Mediterranean peoples.  None of these peoples are called by the  prefix &quot;Afro-&quot; in today's language, so I find Professor Loewen's  use of &quot;Afro-Phoenician&quot; unnecessarily misleading, and a blot on  an otherwise well-written critique.	1999-12-13
