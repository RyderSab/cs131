Sensas!	This beautifully written and intelligently argued book takes us back to a critical time in French history when brilliant, inventive artistic minds and a king bent on making France pre-eminent in European style came together to create, perfect, or popularize an astonishing array of products and ideas we take for granted.  This list is amazingly varied: Champagne as the ne plus ultra for celebrations; folding umbrellas (yes!); full-length mirrors; the diamond as symbol of wealth and power; street lights making a city open at night; the coffee house where one could socialize and get great pastry; haute cuisine cookbooks--and more.  I'm a novelist and essayist and radio reviewer and I found the narrative endlessly gripping and thought-provoking.  This is popular history at its best: lively, witty, entertaining and wise.  The author makes you feel the excitement of a time filled with dazzling characters bent on changing the world around them in big and small ways.  I've read a great deal about this period, but have never before seen it as such a fertile ground for creation in many fields.  Bravo.	2005-10-04

Frank offers compelling explanations for the lack of compassion that we see animating administration initiatives and decisions, and that others see personally, as Cindy Sheehan did (quoted from AlterNet) when she met with the President: <br /> <br />--After Casey's death, Cindy Sheehan was invited to the White House for a visit with Mr. Bush in June of 2004. Her first memory of Bush's appearance that day was when he walked into the room and said in a loud, bluff voice, \\"Who we'all honorin' today?\\" <br /> <br />\\"His mouth kept moving,\\" Sheehan later recalled of her meeting with Bush, \\"but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all. This is a human being totally disconnected from humanity and reality. His eyes were empty, hollow shells.\\" Bush called her \\"Ma\\" or \\"Mom\\" throughout the whole meeting, and never got around to learning her name. <br /> <br />\\"The whole meeting was simply bizarre and disgusting,\\" Sheehan said later. \\"Designed to intimidate instead of providing compassion. He didn't even know our names. I just couldn't believe this was happening. It was so surreal and bizarre. Later I met with some of the other fifteen or sixteen families who were at the White House the same day and, sure enough, they all felt the same way I did.\\"-- <br /> <br />According to Frank, Bush is incapable of grief or compassion, and his analysis is chilling in its believability.  Frank has written a thorough, scary, essential book for our times.	2005-08-09

I doubt it, but everyone seems to believe it's true and many of these people contact Arlette Rosen for help turning their mush into mansucripts and their manuscripts into saleable books.  The novel charts the comic and suprising relationship between Arlette and Harbinger Singh, a tax lawyer who's a tuneful, oddball determined to use a book to either win back his estranged wife--or smite her.  His and Arlette's relationship gets very complicated very quickly and takes surprising turns. <br /> <br />Now, the book is punctuated with mock query letters from a wide variety of wanna-be writers and though they are often ludicrous, the book never takes cheap shots.  Here's where the author's great success lies: she can mock silly, self-absorbed people with loony ideas for books without mocking their very real desire to communicate, to express themselves, to share ideas with the world.  The book is satire, but it's never vicious, it's actually warm and charming.  A lesser author would have been unable to walk this tightrope, but Cohen does so beautifully.	2005-06-13

I recently interviewed the author for Lansing Public Radio's BookTalk and have to put my praise for this book on-line.  I studied French for eight years, won my high school's award and shook the French ambassador's hand, and do well in France or Quebec when I travel (after the first day or so of language shock), but it's always with the help of a new book to brush up my fluency.  This book is the most original, entertaining, and helpful of any of the the ones I've bought over the years.   <br /> <br />The author doesn't lecture or overwhelm you, but rather makes you feel you're sitting down to chat with a very good friend about how the French live, how they speak, and how you can best fit into that world while you travel.  To that end, Schorr very intelligently shows you how to ask substantive questions in French to get people talking so that you can engage in a real conversation and learn from it. She warns you against trying to sound too hip by using inappropriate slang, which may come off as sounding phony.  You'll learn slang terms that are acceptable and others that aren't (in varying degrees).  <br /> <br />The author also ends with epigrammatic French phrases you can learn and embroider so as to manifest wit and style, which the French admire. It may sound intimidating, but it really isn't.  What she's after is getting you to relax and try various methods of entering the culture as a vistor who can truly enjoy it.  A woman in a store on the Ile St. Louis once complimented my French, asked where I was from (America? Hard to believe!) and then sagely observed that one couldn't really appreciate a culture without knowing its language).  Tune Up Your French will take you down that road.  It offers help across the board, but is especially informative about matters of food and dining, and is there anyplace else where the French are more unqiquely themselves?  Best of all, the book is entertaining and funny without going for cheap jokes.  You don't have to be contemplating a trip to France to enjoy this informative, smart, accessible book.	2005-04-25

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Magical, Sophisticated, Graceful, Witty, Wonderful	I'm a bit surprised at some of the reviews below that seem to have expected a crime novel's resolution.  The \\"mystery\\" never quite being resolved isn't disappointing because that's not truly the focus of the book.  It's a reverie, a dream, a story about Louise's journey out of herself, getting unstuck in every possible way. I also think a little knowledge is clearly a dangerous thing when someone complains about the 3rd person POV only showing us the main character.  That's because it's 3rd person limited, folks, not omniscient--and a wise choice it is, or there wouldn't be enough tension. <br /> <br />I thought the POV, the language, the wit, the sexuality, everything about this book was magical, surprising, compelling.  I reviewed it professionally for the Jerusalem Report Magazine and on NPR's (former) The Todd Mundt Show and felt glad to have those opportunities to bring it to readers' attention.  Here's the conclusion of my capsule NPR review: \\"This a magical, romantic book. The prose is lustrous, the tone comic, the characters deeply imagined and sympathetic. An unusual, unforgettable novel.\\"  And here's the last graf of my Jerusalem Report review: \\"Schulman (author of 'The Revisionist') has a keen eye for New York's colorful street life, which she can invest with the romance of 'The Great Gatsby'when she wants to.  She beautifully juggles the comedy and rage flaring up unexpectedly in any intimate relationship and she writes sex scenes as original, elegant and complex as Mary Gordon's in 'Spending' or Lisa Zeidner's in 'Layover.'  Poignant and luminous, this is a book to read aloud, to re-read, to urge on friends.\\" <br />	2005-04-23

Lankford's humor sneaks up on you like that in a finely wrought story of frustrated ambition that seems quintessentially American.<br />The PW et al. reviews tell enough of the story, but they don't truly communicate how authentic this feels, how deeply revelatory it is of the machinations film people not only take for granted, but assume are life itself.<br />BTW, there is absolutely nothing about this book that makes it remotely like Jackie Collins as another reviewer believes, because Lankford knows how to write.	2004-05-04

Set in a seaside English town today and in the early 50s, the book is suffused by a sense of isolation and longing, of human insignificance in the face of the limitless waters that can erase whole cities over time.

Bush	Books	5	105	116	N	N	eseential reading for all thinking citizens	John Dean offers a perspective unique to any of the current books about the administration: he was in the highly scretive, paranoid Nixon administration.  That experience makes him a perfect person to sound the alarm: this administration is not only the most secretive in our history, it is becoming more so day-by-day.  The news stories make that clear, as recently when President Clinton okayed his papers on terrorism being given to the 9/11 commission, but Bush balked.<br />Bush and Cheny hide information about their business pasts, their health, and their current decision-making. Why the secrecy?  Partly to control evidence and information, partly to restore the imperial presidency, partly because of narrow-mindedness and anti-democratic arrogance.  Dean calls his book a polemic, but he's never strident, he's very measured and careful in his arguments and in marshalling his facts.<br />What he finds equally as disheartening as the growing threat to democracy is the slackness of the press, because there are eleven areas of scandal in the current administration that dwarf the Lewinsky Affair and any one of them could turn poisonous--if the press truly paid attention.<br />Most disturbing of all is his view that this is a full co-presidency (despite the lack of honesty around Cheny's heart condition).  Nothing could make that clearer than the fact that Bush and Cheny will appear together when they  testify to the 9/11 commission.  This would be perfect fodder for Leno if it weren't so shocking and unprecedented.<br />Readable, brisk, salutory, this is a standout in the crowd of books about Bush.	2004-04-03

Well, let's call them what they are, what the book calls them, but the press will not: lies.  And the failure of the press to expose those lies is at the sad heart of this beautifully argued book.<br />The author adeptly shows how a faked candidate has fooled much of the country with a faked presidency. It took effort to disguise the President's privilege, past and positions on many issues before the election, but spin and outright lies  aided his acession to the highest office in the land, and continue to convince far too many people that this man is a man of the people, honest, forthright, caring, devoted to freedom.<br />For those who are Republicans or independents wondering if there's any truth here, I would recommend going right to the section that discusses how the Bush campaign fought and destroyed John McCain with lies so ugly they're almost unbelievable.  But then it's all true, as is the Orwellian nature of an administration that camouflages the reality of most of its policies with lovely rhetoric.  At a time when dissent--which Jefferson considered one of a citizen's highest duties--is miscast by our present administration and allies in Congress and the media, as treason, reading this book is an act of true patriotism.	2004-01-22

First, it's sadistic, with unnecessarily long and detailed stalking and torture at the beginning.  There's no need to revel in the torment of the protagonist.  Perhaps the author feels she has to show that she, too, can gross out a reader, just the way some male thriller writers do. <br />Second, the characters are thin, micro-thin, and deadly dull.  The therapist doesn't sound real, nobody sounds real here, because the author has a terrible ear for dialogue.  Try Jospeh Finder's Paranoia for a thriller with good dialogue and characters you can believe in.   <br />Third, the plot twists are ridiculous.  A rapist ends up in the same courtroom as the woman he raped, twelve years later, tried for a different crime?  And then both of them are seeing the same therapist?  Please!  It only gets worse after that, and the author's conception of how serial killers work is way off-base.  I can't give details because it would reveal too much; suffice it to say that when I ran the plot by psychologist friends who have studied serial killers, they found it highly implausible.<br />Fourth, the author can't create setting in the slightest.  There's no sense of New York or Miami here, none at all.  Think of how well Edna Buchanan does the latter, and Jim Fusilli does the former.  Both of them can write rings around this author.<br />Fifth, the writing isn't just full of clichés and amateurish, it's atroocious and consistently unidiomatic.  On page after page I found howlers, read them aloud to a mystery buff friend who asked, \\"Is English her native language?\\"  This book cries out for editing. Why should thrillers be held to a lesser standard of writing than other novels?  How can an editor let a character think he resents being treated as \\"a communal leper\\" or \\"the devil himself incarnate\\"? I could go on and on listing examples of solecisms and mangled prose. It's depressing that print reviewers and reviewers here are calling this book well-written; that shows how low standards have fallen.  <br />Don't waste your money on this book, which is being marketed to death.  The publisher should be ashamed of foisting such work on the public, but sad to say, it will probably do well since so few reviewers seem to care about good writing and solid characterizations.	2004-01-08

That's all critical in the world of publishing and reviewing, which is closer to PEOPLE Magazine every day.	2002-07-21

He subtly weaves in hints of brutality and the supernatural from chapter<BR>one on, as when the cold undergraduate chair has a portrait of the infamous Countess Bathory on her wall (look her<BR>up).  It's all delectable and convincing as the supernatural element becomes stronger and you realize you're reading a gothic fable. <br />But the editor seems to have been AWOL.  The book is 50 pages too long and the satirical set pieces start feeling mechanical, as if he's straining to top himself. The major secret revealed late in the book with enormous fanfare is thunderingly obvious on p. 47 to anyone who's ever read a mystery. There's also a climax that is marred by ludicrous over-reaching and tedious, hokey supernatural huggermugger. But the ending, which returns to the more controlled satirical tone of the opening,almost redeems this novel from its flaws of excess and sloppiness.	2002-02-20
