This is not a biography of everything he did and is not intended to be.  There are no secrets revealed here.  Instead, is an honest look at what life in the CIA was like for Shackley.  In the foreword it is suggest that the word 'My' could have been left out of the title.  This is a fair assessment of the book. <br /> <br />The book does not read like a novel, but neither it is a dry retelling of historical events.  Instead, Shackley uses many different stories to explain different topics such as the use of Air America, Public Relations and Counterintelligence.  Details are left to a minimum.  Anecdotes such as having to leave behind his daughter's rocking horse because it was too big for the moving allowance or getting overly drunk at a ritual going away party in Laos show the human side of the job. <br /> <br />Why 4 Stars?: <br />Shackley and Finney tell some good stories and show a lot about what it is like to have a career in the CIA.  The book is not meant to be a tell-all of CIA operations and it does not attempt to do so; it fits with the no-nonsense manner that Shackley was known for.  Unfortunately, about 50 pages in the middle were just plain boring; my advice to readers is to just barrel through them  becuase it gets better and there are a few good pieces of CIA life in there.  At times, the book follows chronologically, but there is also quite a bit of jumping around.  This weak timeline makes it hard to use as a reference.  All in all, it does give an account of a CIA Officer's career and what it was like to be involved in those events.	2005-09-09

For those who have read Ramona and Junie B. Jones but needed to keep searching - try Judy moody.  Judy is in a bad mood on her first day of third grade with a scowl and when she is forced to sit next the boy who eats paste things get worse.  Her know-it-all little brother, Stink, gets to meet the president, a toad pees on her, her Venus flytrap is eating hamburger...it's no wonder that Judy is in a mood.<br />Judy has good moods, too.  Like when she and her best friend Rocky start the T.P. Club or when playing tricks on Stink.  Through the book, she learns that sometimes things are not as bad as they first appear and that sometimes good can come out of a situation that would seem bad.<br />Why 5 Stars?:<BR>As a third grade teacher I plan to read this book to my class for many years to come ~ in fact, I even plan to use the \\"Me Collage\\" next year.  It shows them how to be comfortable with emotions, and that good can come from anything.  This book is also on an appropriate reading level and interest level for third graders.	2003-11-15

Scary to even imagine this story, Ammaniti's thriller is of a man giving his account of uncovering a horrible secret as a child in 1978 rural Italy.  Wracked with guilt, and curiosity, the boy finds that he cannot even go to his friends or his parents for fear of having to explain and becoming even more embroiled in the affair.  Just when my curiosity had reached the point that I could no longer stand it, Ammaniti reveals the source of the secret and it was a shocker.<br />Ammaniti vividly portrays life in this small town.  The characters work hard and some desperately want a better life and are willing to go to extremes to get it.  Hunt's translation is beautiful and so descriptive it is an art form by itself.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Ammaniti and Hunt have combined efforts to create a thriller that will shock the reader.  I was simultaneously angry with some characters and sympathizing with them.  From the first chapter you will feel as if you know the neighborhood kids and will understand the actions of the parents.  I felt a special bond with the lead character though I, nor anyone else I know, have ever had an experience quite like his.  I couldn't wait to see the end, and it hooked me even more.	2003-07-17

With the exception of being plagued by constant typos, the text reads smoothly and is segmented to give different aspects of the larger picture.  Baer, a man who spent 25+ years in the CIA (most of those while posted in overseas assignments), gained firsthand information from terrorists.  The effects of the intelligence he gathered may be invisible to us for the very fact that he was able to collect and stop the proposed action.  Baer blames the overly politicized machine that has become the CIA in recent years for its failure to foresee the attacks on US interests in recent years.  There is no blame placed on the CIA for its ignoring information that had been received about proposed attacks.  Rather, the blame is placed for the lack of intelligence gathering.<br />Baer lets the average reader in on some of the inner-workings of the CIA.  This is not a spy novel, far from it, but instead we get the chance to see what running an agent is really like.  Because there is a fair amount of sensitive information that is revealed the CIA had to screen the book first.  In a nice move, Baer decided to leave the CIA blackouts in place.  As you are reading about a case officer or the Saudi Royal family, a sentence will be covered with black markings.  In this way, we don't know exactly what the information was, but there is enough there to keep me interested.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The only reason I took a star away from this book was due to Baer's constant references to Middle Eastern contacts.  While he does a good job of giving background information, the situations are so complicated I occasionally had a hard time keeping up with them.  I do recommend this book to any American who wants to know more about how international terrorism takes place and to those who feel that the United States has become overly politicized.	2003-07-06

In a small village with all of the suspicious activity and the murderers even making threats against our primary character (dead on the first page) the narrator is astounded that nobody stopped the crime.  Garcia-M치rquez does an excellent job of showing different sides to give a well-rounded perspective of events.<br />Garcia M치rquez is one of the best writers of recent times.  This book should be heralded as one of his classics for its straightforward style that does not leave out any details.  By the end, the reader feels as if he knows the characters personally.  Garcia-M치rquez accomplishes so much in such a relatively short amount of space.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book gets top marks for its captivating series of events and creative storytelling.  The characters are so colorful and so lifelike that the reader will feel as though s/he could converse with them.  Anyone interested in being \\"well-read\\" or with an interest in world literature should give this book a chance - you'll be hooked on the first page.	2003-06-19

This is the only book in the series that I have looked at, but I didn't understand the reasoning behind the editor's choice in selections.  I found the text too small and too long to be read by 7-year olds.  The subject matter was at times questionable for youngsters of this age.  This is not to say that the selections are worthless.  There were a few classics and a few that I had never read but have grown to love.  Still, out of 19 stories, I found just three that I would consider gems.  One of those has a strong Christian message and is not appropriate for public school.  Therefore, I don't feel this is the best set of stories to read to your child.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>If you want an extensive library of stories to read to your child, then perhaps this could be an addition.  However, you will need to screen everything first.  Your child will have heard many, may be scared by some and bored by others.  If I were you, I would leave this one at the bookstore.  It is more of a showpiece to sit on the shelf than to be read.	2003-06-16

He warns about the potential pitfalls that could get in the way of retirees from the North as well as providing insights to the wonders that Mexico holds in store.  There is information to assist in relocation as well as how to prepare for the different lifestyle.  However, it is lacking as Mr. Lubber really only speaks about living in the region where he does.<br />This is an excellent book if you are researching places to retire on an international level.  However, don't plan on using it as a step-by-step guide for your move.  Many of the websites and other contact information have fallen out-of-date as well as the information regarding technological advances in the country.

This volume should be reviewed once or twice a year for teachers at international schools to remind them of some helpful information in making their teaching careers easier.

Most of the riddles deal with the repeated addition style of multiplication, but with a twist.  In an array of five rows and five columns, there may be three missing.  So, in order to find the total of 22 quickly, the student is guided to multiply five times five and then subtract the three missing ones.<br />The rhymes are catchy with the question in a different color font to help students when learning to decipher word problems.  There is also a tip to the mental math solution following the question. The goal of this book is assisting students in learning to manipulate groups of objects in their mind.<br />I would suggest using a few poems as examples with real manipulatives and demonstrating to students how and why the solution can be found mentally.  Read the solution along with them and physically move objects to show how they can multiply and then add or subtract, or even regroup objects.  When students begin to catch on, invite them to try some more from the book, and write out the solutions before checking their answers.  Advanced students may even want to create their own puzzles and illustrations.  As an extra challenge, they can write the poems to go along with it.  All of Tang's poems are written in couplets and this has the potential for being a good integration with language arts.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Tang has crafted a wonderful set of thinking exercises for students to explore mathematical properties through the use of patterns.  By practicing with these poems, hopefully they will change the way in which they \\"see\\" difficult problems and be able to visualize in a way that makes sense to them.	2003-05-27

All of the family members turn the house inside out in their pursuit of a few dollars with which to buy dinner.  Different pigs find different combinations of coins and bills before going off to the restaurant.  Looking at the menu, the pigs must make decisions about how much food they can afford to buy and how much they will have left over.  Each time, the reader is not given the amounts, and the back of the book includes drawings of the money and the equations showing their total amounts.<br />This book has a lot of possibilities for student's to learn to use money.  For example, with or without manipulatives, students can be asked to find the amounts that various family members find as they find them, and also keep a running total.  When at the restaurant, students can also view the menu, and select what they and some friends would order and how much they would have left over.  Finding other combinations of coins and bills with the same total could extend the activity.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>I had to take a point off for having a very weak and uninteresting plot line.  However, the math elements that can be tied into the illustrations and the concepts dealing with money are top-notch.  This book is excellent for activities dealing with counting and the addition and subtraction of money.	2003-05-27

A triangle who enjoys being a musical instrument, and catching the wind for sailboats shares his stories with his friends.  Eventually, he began to feel dissatisfied and asked the shape-shifter to give him an extra side and an extra angle.  After working for a while as a quadrilateral and sharing his new stories with his friends he once again becomes dissatisfied with his role and returns to the shape-shifter to have more sides added.  The reader sees where the shape lives his life with his different amounts of sides and angles.  With continued dissatisfaction, he adds sides and angles until he is nearly round and rolls down a hill.  This is when he asks the shape-shifter to return to his former self.<br />Because the back of this book includes tips for teachers and parents to incorporate this book, it can be very useful as an educational tool.  Taking a walk and searching for a particular shape in the world, or even spotting several makes students think about how they are seen.  One pitfall that should be combated is children's tendency to recognize shapes only when they are in their most familiar form.  That is, they should have some practice with flipped, turned and rotated shapes.  Asking students to view a shape and then incorporate it into a drawing of a real-world illustration will help them as well.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Marilyn Burns has changed the way that many teachers approach the subject of math in the elementary school.  This book is a wonderful accompaniment to her teaching philosophy and methods.  The tips and strategies included at the end for teachers, parents and anyone else who may want to use this book just help to reinforce her teaching.  I did have to take a point off for reusing the concept and becoming a little sparse with examples of shapes - the illustrations were also somewhat lacking.  But in the end, this is a wonderful addition to the library of anyone who teaches about shapes.	2003-05-27

I have enjoyed his books in the past, with their quips about the encroaching forces from the North that are constantly eroding our beautiful Florida environment.  However, this book starts off slow with an unbelievably wild string of events and just gets stranger.<br />Hiaasen has never been known for down-to-earth writing, but this one just gets a little too fantastic - and BORING!  His deification of the newspaper business is out of hand.  The characters, while wild as usual, don't quite make sense.  I kept expecting fun and exciting to happen - all the way to the disappointing end.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>There are much better action/adventure books out there about South Florida and its crooked politicians.  Most can only be appreciated by those who live &quot;South of the Lake&quot; and most were written by Carl Hiaasen himself.  This book lacks the coherent quality of writing that I search for in a good novel.  If I were you I would pass.  Still, it is entertaining on a lower level, it would be much better to read a few chapters and put aside - there's no complicated plot line to forget so you'll be alright.	2003-04-18

The hole cut into her house to add a new room for her where she must sleep all alone is a source of fear, and also bravery for the adorable star.  Being constantly misunderstood is a great challenge for the 6 (going on 37) year old Ramona.  Ramona is just like any other child.  She gets confused and throws fits. She is such a loveable character because a most wonderful author creates her so deftly and realistically.<br />The text is appropriate for students in grades 3-6. It also works well in a read-aloud setting with this age group. These students (and teachers and parents as well) will get a kick out of remembering how scary starting school can be. I recall hearing it read to me in 2nd grade and now have done the same with my students. A good laugh was heard everyday from our room.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Cleary repeatedly made young people reflect upon their own days as an even younger person with a string of books about experiencing the world through the eyes of a curious little girl with a will all of her own.  This book is the third in the series and was written in the 1970s.	2003-03-17

When this story picks up the girls have been on the island for about 4 months and have pretty much settled in to island though they spend almost all of their time building a boat to carry them away from it.  When yet another storm takes yet another boat from them the story starts really losing its momentum and becomes a little far-fetched.  the impassible lagoon is suddenly able to have a raft leave and then a rescue ship come in unharmed - it conflicts with everything that had been built up before it.<br />Aber apparently was not able to fit all of her story of the Lost Girls into one book, but did not have enough material for a true series.  The editors should have had her combine the two.  The real reason for reading this book after Adrift is simply for some closure.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The characters have become too similar and boring.  The events are more interesting, but become a little fantastic.  If you haven't read the prequel, I wouldn't bother with this one.  Still, it is entertaining and not poorly written.

So long they have been without books, that they have actually forgotten to read.<br />When Eli begins visiting his Aunt Chip, she teaches him to read.  The most wonderful gift in the world.  His enthusiasm spreads and soon all the children are begging to have Aunt Chip teach them to get stories from a book.  When the adults learn of what is happening they respond at first in fear and anger, but eventually want their children to teach them to read.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Polacco has a wonderful way of making her characters a little zany, but still real enough to be believable.  The watercolor illustrations give the soft feeling of her words.  Most importantly, the message of the importance of books and reading is something that purveys through most of Polacco's works.

Gertrude Chandler Warner's books about four orphans who solve mysteries have been delighting children for over 50 years.  She saw a need for books that were both easy and fun to read.  The Boxcar Children meet that goal exceptionally well.  In this first book in the series, the mystery the children are trying to solve is to hide from their mean grandfather.  The experiences they have are nearly comical, but most importantly they accomplish so many things with very little adult supervision, giving young readers a sense of independence.<br />I never read the books as a child, and wish that I had.  Unlike other authors, such as Beverly Cleary, E.B. White, etc. Warner's books have fallen out of the times.  The stories no longer work in a contemporary setting and with very little historical data, they cannot really be historical fiction.  The story simply could not happen today, and there are many references to ways of life that children today would have nothing to compare to.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>These books have survived so long because they are easy and fun to read.

The other kids realize that Donald Zinkoff is not very coordinated.  He has troubles with his handwriting and he does some other things that are just plain \\"weird.\\"  By the time the students reach fourth grade, nobody wants Zinkoff on their team for field day.  He proves why by turning in a terrible performance and earns his nickname.<br />Throughout the story Donald makes some uncommon friends without recognizing them for what they are.  Among them are an elderly woman, a catatonic man and a toddler girl.  It is with these friends that he finds a purpose in his life.  For one person in particular, it becomes all too important that Donald Zinkoff existed and that he was not a loser.<br />The story does not start off with a gripping storyline, but it is interesting watching Donald grow up and see how he is treated in school.  Spinelli has a way of causing the reader to fall in love with a character and to be able to feel the same things he is.  I never saw the climax coming, but I was wringing my hands along with the main character.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Jerry Spinelli has written many books that are age-appropriate for 4-7 graders.

This book has a lot of potential, but needed a few more revisions.  Many different plot lines confuse the central one that Kimmel is attempting to focus one.  Character development comes very late in the story.  This combination of shortcomings makes the book hard to get into.<br />The descriptions of Wales are beautiful and I am sure the author did her homework on the subject.  The foggy moors and ancient stone buildings just add to the atmosphere of her ghostly tale.  This book would work well for discussions of Welsh history and folklore in general.  However, its slow pace and other problems will mar its power in a group reading.  Possibly a read aloud would work better.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>I enjoyed the descriptions of the landscape and the element of ghosts.

To save their Jewish countrymen, many Danes willingly defied the Nazis and helped their friends.  This book tells a fictional story about one such situation.<br />This is an incredible book about a forgotten part of the Jewish Holocaust.  I believe strongly in teaching about this event so that people always remember it and will not repeat it.  We all know what happened in Germany, but this story does not go to the concentration camps.  It instead shows a side not often seen of some of the true heroes of WWII.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>We need to teach about such an impactful event in our history or else risk repeating it.  This book tells a wonderfully crafted story with many accurate details about an often forgotten part of WWII.  It is appropriate for fourth graders and up.  With short chapters and numerous published teaching guides, it lends itself very well as a teaching material and literature support for a study of WWII.	2002-11-05

Perloo, is one such Montmer.  While he would rather stay in his den reading, Lucabara, the monarch's aide calls upon him to let him know that he has been named the new Granter and ruler of all of the Montmers.  Unfortunately, Berwig the Big, rightful heir to the throne is not pleased and so accuses Perloo of murdering the previous Granter.  Forced to flee, Perloo and Lucabara find solace in the arms of their enemies...<br />Perloo stands up for himself and could even serve as a role model.  He makes some very good decisions.  The book had quite a bit of adventure and humor.  The pace was a little slow, but I still kept turning the pages.  There are a lot of political and anti-war undertones that may not be picked up by less adept readers, but it is entertaining on a surface level.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Appropriate for 5th graders and older, Perloo is an interesting, and, at times, exciting story.  The political allegories are woven in expertly by Avi.  But, the question is, is the reading level appropriately matched with content?  This is why it had to have a star taken off.  Still, it is a good addition to any child's library and works well for discussions.	2002-11-05

Captain Underpants has a definite feel of comic books, but placed into a chapter book format.  There is even some flipbook animations.<br />Boys and girls alike who are still in that stage where bodily functions are hilarious will take an interest in this book.  It is solidly written with age-appropriate vocabulary and text structure.  There is of course a lot of comedy, but some of it may be written over the heads of the youngest of the kids this would appeal to.<br />Why 4 stars?:<br />This book is funny and will hopefully gain the interest of 2nd-5th graders.  It is written on a fairly low level but is perfect for introducing chapter books and their format.  Anything that gets a child to read is god book in my mind.	2002-11-05

She must deal with her older sister making fun of her, not being allowed to pull a little girl's curls and walking to school with Howie (the boy from down the street whom Ramon could do without).<br />Ramona is just like any other 5-year old. She gets confused and throws fits. She is such a loveable character because a most wonderful author creates her so deftly and realistically.<br />The text is appropriate for students in grades 2-5. It also works well in a read-aloud setting with this age group. These students (and teachers and parents as well) will get a kick out of remembering how confusing a time kindergarten can be. I recall hearing it read to me in 2nd grade and now have done the same with my students. A good laugh was heard everyday from our room.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Cleary repeatedly made young people reflect upon their own days as an even younger person with a string of books about experiencing the world through the eyes of a curious little girl with a will all of her own. This book is the second in the series that predates Junie B. Jones and was much better written.	2002-10-21

He doesn't tell the reader what he needs to do however, just reminds us of the way that Jesus lived and that we should look at him as an example of how to live.  Enhancing this message is a very useful study guide perfect for small group study or even individual contemplation.<br />Lucado's illustrations using his own family and experiences really help to fit his words and the words of the Bible into our own lives and remind us that &quot;He loves you just the way you are, but he refuses to leave you that way.  He wants you to be just like Jesus.&quot;<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Lucado has turned out another powerful book concerning how we can become like Jesus.  The study guide make the reading of the book even stronger by challenging the reader to look deeper into his own life.  Recommended for those strong in their faith, but still wanting to improve their walk with God, all the way to those who are just curious about who Jesus is.	2002-09-22

Jones could not have existed without Ramona being her predecessor.  But, this new precocious little girl brings her own attitude to the genre and makes a whole new generation of children giggle with delight and rush to the library to get the next edition in the series.  Junie B. is excited about her first day at kindergarten but not about the bus where things can get dumped on her head and that boy that she just hates.  So, she doesn't get on the bus to go home, but hides out until everyone goes home.  With the whole school to herself, Junie B. is free to explore and have some fun.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book has kept my students in stitches and any book that children are running to get off the shelves has some value.  This one has more than just a little as it features a recognizable character that children can identify and grow with throughout the series.  The vocabulary, word use and subject material are all grade-level appropriate.  Highly recommended.	2002-09-22

A 10-year old girl named India Opal finds a dog in a grocery store.  In a scene reminiscent of Li'l Orphan Annie she saves him from the store manager and names him the first thing that pops into her head.  Opal and Winn-Dixie are inseparable after this.  The dog has an uncanny way of knowing what people want and need and taking care of things.  This is a cute, heartwarming story set in a small south Florida town with quite a bit of local flavor.<br />Everybody India and Winn-Dixie seem to run into has a problem.  Through some minor coercion, this pair is able to get people to leave the past behind them and enjoy life once again.  A lesson we could all use once in a while.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book is excellent to read to a class of third-graders and up when coming back from lunch.  It is on an independent level for most fourth graders.  My only complaint is that the setting could be almost anytime in the last century and Opal always felt younger to me than she really is.  But, those are not reasons to keep you from reading this book.  It is highly recommended and is a quick read.	2002-09-09

They must all work together now to survive.  There are lessons that can be learned by readers about how to get along with others despite our differences.  The book is written on a nice level for fifth graders and above.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This is an excellent book to show girls how they can get along even with all of their differences.  Not only the struggle of the personalities, but also that of survival captivate the reader.  The text is appropriate for about fifth graders and above.	2002-09-01

For the next two weeks, she plans to live a different life while away at camp.  Unfortunately, before she can even board the bus, she becomes responsible for Fern, a girl whose hygiene practices will prevent her from being popular.  Dinah's problem is that she is just too nice.  When she meets two girls at camp who she really wants to be friends with it doesn't take long before they all realize that Fern does not fit in with the group.  But, how to tell her is the trick.  Dinah spends a lot of time dealing with this issue.<br />This was a great book that shows how to deal with friendships and going away to camp.  It is appropriate for fourth and fifth graders and will probably be more interesting to girls.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>\\"Buddies\\" shows friendships in different lights and attempts to highlight the importance of different people in our lives.  It is age appropriate for fourth graders and above.  I only took a star off because the ending was somewhat incomplete.  The story did not tie up all of the loose ends quite as well as I would have expected.  Perhaps, Mrs. Park was expecting this to become as popular as her Junie B. Jones series.  In any case, this book is still worth the read and if you can find it, it will make a nice addition to a school or classroom library.	2002-09-01

Following a young teenager who is a little unsure of herself as most teens are, the reader is brought along with her as a CIT in summer camp.  She has lost a lot of weight and is still awkward around boys.  Very surprised to have a boy coming on to her she jumps at the chance to be with him.<br />There's a small use of profanity in this book as well as discussions about sex.  I didn't find this book appropriate for the grade levels that it was written for and would most appeal to (middle school).  This book's subject matter is really appropriate for high schoolers who probably would not be interested.  The only reason I gave it a second star was because if it will get a child to read who wouldn't have otherwise, then it has some value.<br />Why 2 stars?:<BR>Don't waste your time on this one.  The story is dull, characters flat, use of profanity and not grade-level appropriate.  There are much better books out there on similar topics.  I would suggest \\"Buddies\\" by Barbara Park.	2002-08-31

She eventually is able to befriend her captors and even go out of her way to ensure their secret is kept safe.  As they must leave town, they give her a small bottle of the water of eternal life so the choice can be hers.  You'll have to read the book to find out what she does with it.<br />This book will lend itself well to group discussions from fourth grade on up.  The troubles associated with not being able to die and being stuck at the same age for eternity are brought up in this story.  The level of the text and subject matter are appropriate for these ages.  The chapters are short and the pace moves.  This will help to keep children interested.<br />Why 5 stars?:<br />This is an appropriate text that may be just slightly challenging for fourth graders, but probably better for fifth graders.  The story is at a nice pace and raises many interesting discussion questions.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-24

This one centers on a 9-year old boy trying to become a great hitter to win his father's love.  The whole time he doesn't realize that he is an excellent outfielder and his father would love him anyway.  A touching story and quick read.<br />Vocabulary is kept basic, and chapters are kept short.  However, the amount of baseball knowledge and terminology is incredible.  This book may appeal to many children due to the topic, but if they are not prepared for the explanations of baseball plays, they will lose interest.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This book was well constructed as far as vocabulary and chapter length to be a beginning chapter book.  However, I had to take off one star due to the amount of baseball vernacular that is used and may not be understood by all children.  It gets very heavy.	2002-08-24

Each chapter follows a year in their life and the incredible event that occurred during that week.  Each year, the reader can see a difference in the two kids, as they are growing older.  More importantly this book could be very useful in teaching about the depression and its effects in the cities and farming towns of the Midwest.  There are many historical references that can be used to support lesson plans or to spur discussions.  Several times, I was reminded of the farming town that my grandmother's family came from in rural Illinois - towards the end of the book the town was actually mentioned - Farmer City.  The story is well crafted and kept me entertained.  However, I would feel that the chapters are a bit lengthy and therefore should not be used until middle school.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book is simply captivating.  Several times since finishing it I have craved to be there again.  It will make you laugh and cry.  This is a wonderful piece of literature and should be enjoyed by all.	2002-08-21

A committee makes decisions regarding a person's clothing, job, spouse and even children.  These people know no other way of life and so do not question it.  They are unfeeling drones in a world designed to eliminate pain, embarrassment and any type of negative emotions.  In doing so, the positive emotions have disappeared as well.  A young boy is chose to be the successor of the one person who does have the knowledge of what life was once like.  They become lockboxes of this wisdom that cannot be shared, only transferred.  Through their transmissions and discussions they idealize to share both love and pain with the Community and therefore forever change them.  This book brings up a lot of issues for preteens be-ginning puberty.  The Community could be a metaphor for a child's life before he opens his eyes and starts to experience it for himself without being protected from anything that could go wrong.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>I feel this is a wonderful piece of literature.  However, I took one star off because teachers and parents must be incredibly careful when introducing this book to children.  I have seen it used as young as fourth grade, but it is so intense and brings up so many issues about life as we know it (and don't know it yet), that it takes a very mature audience.  It should only be used with close supervision and guidance.	2002-08-21

He has many common themes however to the stories that had been passed down for generations.  This story is of a young girl sent away by her evil stepmother.  She then must rescue her eleven brothers from the spell that has been placed upon them.  In a dream, a fairy came to her and gave her the answer.  So after, a king falls in love with her at first sight.  This tale is a bit lengthy and has a few passages of irrelevant information, but because the reader feels an emotional attachment to the girl so quickly, attention never waivers.  The watercolor illustrations help to support the text, but at times do not have very much contrast, giving them a murky feel.  Second graders would be able to read the text; however it may take until fourth grade for children to be able to do it in one sitting.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Some passages in the story can get a bit lengthy.  Although the text is written on a second grade level, it may take a while before students can read this in one sitting.  However, they will definitely listen to it, as the characters are very captivating.  The illustrations are a little muddy though.	2002-08-20

The wonderful drawings tell the story with splendid detail.  Bordering the text are more drawings that help to establish the setting and mood of the story.  The text is even more exciting than the illustrations.  A brave knight is summoned by a beautiful princess to slay the dragon that has been tormenting the land of the fairy queen.  After several battles and assistance from magical entities, the knight defeats his foe and is granted the princess as a prize.  There can be quite a lot of text on a single page causing it to be overwhelming in its lack of white space.  The narrative is fast-paced enough that the reader will stay interested though.  This book should be on an independent level for high second graders.  Younger children will enjoy hearing it and seeing the pictures though.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>I simply love the mythical magic of dragons.  The illustrations included in this version are gorgeous.  The story can be understood and enjoyed by children of all ages.  Second graders should be able to read this book with just some slight assistance.	2002-08-20

He has chose to include twenty of the classic German tales in this beautiful edition.  Hardcover, with gilted pages, and metallic highlights in the illustrations creates a very stunning picture.  Philip has selected some of the most well known favorites, but also a few that modern times have forgotten.  The reading level is approximately third grade, though the stories look as though they would be better understood and more entertaining if read aloud.  There tends to be just one illustration per story.  While they are wonderfully done and framed with more artwork, they don't do much to tell the plot of the story and are not always matched up with the text.  Every classroom should have a collection of Grimm's fairy tales, but this isn't the one.  This book seems to have been designed more for collectors and to sit on a shelf than to be handled by youngsters on a daily basis in a classroom environment.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This is not a book to be read, but one to be collected and set upon a shelf to collect dust.  The illustrations are beautiful and the information provided about the tales and the brothers is excellent.  However, this book was not made for children to read their favorite tales from.	2002-08-20

The surprise ending is also a common element that keeps the reader interested.  His poems range in style from simple one-line jokes, to narrative epics with a repeating chorus.

She is made to marry a local boy who is not of average intelligence and try to fit into a modern gussak, or American, lifestyle in Alaska.  The problem is, she was raised as a traditional Eskimo.  At a particularly trying time for her, she packs up a few belongings and runs away, planning on crossing the tundra herself to get to where she can catch a plane to San Francisco and start a new life.<br />Several days out, she is having trouble finding food, but she is able to study the habits of a pack of wolves and learn how they communicate.  She becomes a part of their pack and they look out for her on her journey.  When she does finally get to the town, there is a BIG surprise waiting for her - but I won't spoil that for you.<br />Like any of George's books, this book sends a message of how \\"civilization\\" has gotten out of town and helps people to vicariously move out into the country and survive off of the land.  My only problem is the three sections of the book can be a little incongruous and occasionally there are some very long passages between natural break points making the book that much more difficult for middle grade readers.  However, if this it the right book for them due to the topic, they will be deal with the length of the sections.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The sections can be long, but it is written on a level that appeals to its target audience.  It is somewhat selective, as the naturists, and those who are against the increasing spread of cities and decreasing of natural environments will appreciate it.  There is also a strong sense of pride in one's heritage that comes out.	2002-08-19

A very simple tale, which can easily be read by first graders, has the moral of taking pride in yourself and being happy with who you are.  When the poor shoe-maker is given a bag of gold, he loses his friends and his happiness.  He realizes money and wealth did not make him content.  The coverflaps have a lot of praise for the illustrator.  He has an interesting style, but his artwork does not grab the attention of the reader and can be overly busy and erratic.  It is a shame the artwork brings down this otherwise excellent fable that should be read to all children in our overly competitive capitalist society.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This is a nice fable, with a wonderful message about greed and capitalism.  Unfortunately, its illustrations are attempting an abstract style that they just don't quite pull off.	2002-08-19

Whether the story is true or not does matter.  It still tells about the American frontierland in Colonial days.  Johnny Appleseed has become a model of American Patriotism and good will.  Aliki has done a nice job of bringing him to life again while keeping the text simple enough so that mid-year first graders should be able to start on this book.  The illustrations are oil pastel and tell what they need to without being too busy.  They are well matched to the text and, like many books of its day, alternates between color and black-and-white illustrations.  This is a nice edition that children will be able to read and learn an American Tall Tale at the same time.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book is on a level that most children will be able to read in kindergarten and first grade.

Serving the purpose of an introduction to Greek mythology, this book gives a well-rounded biography of \\"Hera's glory,\\" Hercules.  A series of these books done in the same style would have made it easier for teachers to design units on mythology for young children.  The illustrations complement the text nicely, however because there is a lot of information on a single page, the picture cannot always tell enough.  The text is set off from the illustration in a colorful, but easy to read manner.  Some of the vocabulary and pronunciations will need to be explained and demonstrated, and probably should not have been included.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>The illustrations are absolutely wonderful, unfortunately the text drags the books down.  There is too much information on a single page.  I do not support the condensing of myths, but this book would have been better if it focused on a single aspect of Hercules' life rather than trying to tell the whole thing in a picture book format.  It's just too heavy.	2002-08-19

Lagerl칬f was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for literature in 1909.  This legend, retold by Ellin Greene, originally appeared in a magazine in 1907.  The illustrations are beautiful.  They capture the emotions of the characters splendidly.  The story is not too long for advanced second graders to read in a single sit-ting.  Younger children will be able to listen to it.  Several times however the layout alternates from a two-page spread of text to a two-page illustration.  The text pages can appear overwhelming for young readers, and because there is not an illustration on every page, it can be cumbersome to use in a read-aloud.  The story does, of course, have a mention of the Christ Child and central characters include a Bishop, Abbot and lay priest.  There is no attempt to influence the reader on behalf of the Christian faith however.  Still, it may create some difficulties in a public school classroom.  A well-written and illustrated legend, it is a shame the design features make it less appealing and it may create some trouble in a public school classroom.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This is a nice story, but has some logistical design flaws.

The short stories attributed to Aesop have been around for over 2,500 years.  Many times no longer than a paragraph is enough for the reader to see the moralistic truth of the world around us summed up in a brief encounter between animals.  The illustrations are well done and will be appreciated by adults, but for the most part were not created for children.  The vocabulary and grammar can also be difficult for young children on their own, but will be understood if it is read to them with the proper pauses and inflections.  Every fable has its moral underneath it.  Many of them children will recognize from other storybooks.  Every teacher should have a collection of Aesop's fables.  Although this edition is not the best for young children it would still make an excellent addition to the classroom library.<br />Why 4 stars?:<br />While I do feel this is a good book to read to children and to show the illustrations to.  It will be too difficult for them to read on their own.	2002-08-19

Lewis has written a series of poems that all have to do with animals of different types.  His form varies from an ABAB rhyme scheme with four line stanzas to haiku and everything in between.  Every page is covered in large colorful illustrations, leaving little or no white space at all.  The pages feel busy and take away from the inherent simplicity and elemental nature of the poetry.  Further, the font does not stand out from the page enough and some poems can be difficult to read due to the illustration underneath.  White there are a lot of different styles introduced in this book, all of them are formal and somewhat rigid.  It could possibly give children the idea that poems have to follow one of these forms and take the fun out of the writing process.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>Very nice mix of poems, but all are forced and follow typical patterns, which could take the fun out of poetry for many children.  Furthermore, because of the page design and color choices, much of the text is hard to read.	2002-08-19

Konigsburg has written 5 short stories that each are designed to teach a lesson about life in a subtle manner.  The stories are somewhat entertaining and beautifully written.  While there is something that can be learned from life, none of these stories have large impacting moments; rather they are all lessons we learn from daily experiences with people.  That was what I liked about it.<br />What I didn't like is that it was very slow moving and the stories were a bit lengthy with too much background information about characters we will not know for very long anyhow.  Because of this I would not use the book as a read-aloud in a classroom environment, but some children may enjoy reading.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This is a beautifully written book that shows some lessons that we all learn in life through varied experiences.  It doesn't suit well to read-alouds and the stories can get a bit long and bogged down with unimportant details.  However, this may be just the right book for some child and if it keeps him reading then it is invaluable.	2002-08-13

Actually, I wouldn't say yuck to this book at all.  It is a very nice early readers book.  The plot follows a little girl at summer camp who is a detective.  When the counselor gives her bunk a mystery to solve, the game is on.  Several of the girls are in competition to solve the riddle and win their prize.<br />This book is written on such a level that first and second graders can read a chapter book with a real plot.  The chapters are several pages long because of the typesetting.  This will make them feel they are making real progress and get them exciting about reading.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This book is a prime example of the genre and serves its purpose well.  However, the plot is a little weak.	2002-08-11

Robinson has compiled a collection of stories about a rather average family in the Midwest with some unusual quirks.  The stories begin with nine year old Louis driving a car unnoticed and get wilder from there.  I didn't find the stories to be very funny or very entertaining.  Neither did the third and fourth graders that I field-tested it with.<br />The chapters are a little too long to use in a read aloud situation and not many upper elementary students were not able to hold their attention spans long enough to enjoy the book on their own.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>I will keep this book on my shelf in the classroom, but will not use it for anything.  It will be around for a child to read if he feels so inclined.  The stories are too long and not very captivating, but if it gets a child to read, then it has some value.	2002-07-28

From my childhood I have memories of teachers reading to us about the little girl who likes to do things her way.  This book introduces the character of Ramona at the age of four and of course her sister Beatrice (Beezus), their parents and Henry Huggins.<br />Cleary's writing has two clear advantages.  1) She creates real characters that children can relate to and make the mistakes and feel the same way they do.  2) The language she uses can be understood by all while still posing a slight challenge to be read individually.  The only problem with the book is that it was written nearly 50 years ago and is slightly out of date.  However, updated illustrations, Cleary's habit of using only fictitious names and r4eality based plots have helped to keep the book relevant to today's readers.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>While it is not the best in the series it is the one that began the Ramona Series.  Due to its age it has been dated to a point, but maintains its appeal to today's readers.  The writing is appropriate and interesting to elementary school readers and will hopefully keep them interested in reading.	2002-07-24

A charming story of some very believable second graders and a trip to a theme park with a scary ride.  When harry is afraid to ride it, Song Lee and Doug, the narrator, help to give their friend some courage.  Meanwhile, another boy is making fun of him and a little girl wants nothing to do with him.  The story shows how we all have fears that the support of our friends can help us to overcome.  The characters do not have much time to develop, but are very real.  Song Lee and her mother are Korean.  Their dialogue is written with their accent to show diversity.  This is a good book for middle second-graders and above to get used to the style of chapter books.  Chapters are less than ten pages, with large type and always an illustration.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The bully character can get a little out of hand.  I would have expected someone to step in and not let him torment Harry as much.  Still, this is a good book that will serve as a good introduction to chapter books.  The nice part about this series is a reader can start anywhere without missing too much.	2002-06-02

The story line is practically nonexistent as a child tells of the things in his bedroom and then says goodnight to each one in turn. The repetition and rhyming couplets aid in the decoding of words and rhythm of the speech. However, the rhyming and too frequent use of the word \\"and\\" mimic neither speech patterns nor the conventions of writing. It must be explained to children beforehand that the text is poetic and not prose. The text can be hard to read in places with red lettering over a purple background. The illustrations switch from colorful, rich cartoons to black and white isolated sketches, which is characteristic of the times when it was published (to save money).  But, they do give a feeling of discontinuity. This book did nothing special for me and I don't plan on using it in my classroom...	2002-06-02

The most difficult word is \\"deliciously\\" which would be a challenge for first grader, but could be accomplished with some assistance.  The illustrations are simple, but clearly convey meaning while not crowding the text.  The relationship between text and pictures is very good - the picture matches the text so that the reader can use it to help decode words.  With short pages, short sentences, and only a few trouble words, this book lends itself to being used for a Running Record in Kindergarten, first and second grade classrooms.  It is a complete beginner's book that young students can read on their own that does still have a real plot.  Because Sam is a zookeeper and there are lots of animals in the story, that may help to arouse interest.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This is a nice beginner's book for those children just learning to read.  It is a nice size for little hands to hold.  The text is large, but does not crowd the pictures or vice versa.	2002-06-02

So many different characters are introduced that there is little time to see them develop.  The illustrations nicely complement the story and may help those with struggling imaginations or who read so slowly that they forget the story.  The illustrations are spread through the text very well - it is never more than two or three pages before the next one.  This means young readers will be turning pages more often and feel they are making progress.  The story deals with some children who are sent out of the classroom for remedial reading.  This may encourage readers older than my suggested late first to early third grade level.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>The story is completely plot-driven.  Even at this beginning stage of reading children are still capable of meaningful discussion of what they are reading, but this book doesn't provide much material for it.  If kids don't associate the higher thinking that comes from reading, it will be viewed as a chore and they will no longer enjoy it.  This book does not encourage students to get excited about reading, or share it with others.	2002-06-02

Instantly, she is transported to a supermarket of types where shoppers dressed in their pajamas select from the shelves what kind of dream they will be having that night.  Pip and Joseph reunite and begin playing with a dragon that breathes fire in the girl's face.  They must chase the dragon through the dream shop and catch him so he can be safely put back in his place.  With enough excitement out of the way, the two go back home.  The next morning, Joseph rides his bike to Pip's house to give her a special gift from the night before.<br />The watercolor paintings are wonderful.  The style gives them an almost dream-like quality that supports the material.  However, the second 2-page spread features a close-up of the little girl in the center.  Because of the binding the picture loses its effect and appears jumbled - the illustrator and/or editor should have anticipated this as well as making her nightgown a little longer and not quite so transparent.  However, the text alternates between black and white because it is often laid over top of the illustrations making it quite difficult to read at times, especially for beginning readers.  Still, the subject is entertaining and will help to prompt children's imaginations and discussions about dreams.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The concept was very well represented and it can spur many activities and discussions with even very young children.  Older children may benefit from thinking about imagination in a new and different way.  However, because the text can be hard to see at times, I had to take a star away.	2002-05-31

Tommy and his little brother want to buy a big special marble from a tough kid down the street.  But first, they need to find out how to get the money - without trying to sell mom's prize roses!  His brother and he find a snake and try to make a trade with that.  Several episodes fill the hunt to get such an exciting marble.  Each episode is its own chapter and seems to end with Tommy getting into trouble.<br />A nice introduction to chapter books, because the chapters are kept short.  Furthermore, kids can relate to Tommy's adventures because the logic he uses is common for 9 year olds.  This book is a slight departure from Fletcher's usual intermediate novels but is none the less enjoyable.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>I liked this book from a teacher's standpoint because of its value as an introductory chapter book and realistic characters (something found in all of Fletcher's books), however, I didn't find the story to be very interesting.  This could keep kids from continuing in it and getting a negative feeling about chapter books.  Still, most children will still enjoy it and so it does belong in a classroom.  It is already in mine.	2002-05-30

Told as a story by the narrator, we experience a little bit about each of his 4 brothers and 1 sister.  Each one is a true character in every sense of the word, but at the same time, is very realistic.  This is a very real family with characters that I just fell in love with.  They are not always as nice as can be and they make mistakes - even the adults.  We follow the family through a year in their lives (all from the point of view of the oldest child).  There are ups and downs, but in the end everyone does love each other and is there to support each other.<br />This is a wonderful book about the enduring strength of family and the love and support that can be found in them.  There are moments that will make the reader laugh at loud and others that will bring a tear to the eye of even the hardest individual.  I truly wish this book had gained more recognition.<br />The opportunities for writing activities and discussions based on the book are endless with a little creativity.  I fully intend on using this book in my classroom and hope others will as well.  Like other Ralph Fletcher books, this is quality literature for students and adults - not simply a kid's book.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book is incredibly well written with very real characteristics.  It brings the reader through a variety of emotions as the narrator tells us about his family and the events that occur over the course of a year.  The chance to engage students in sharing and discussing literature are excellent.  I highly recommend this book for school libraries, and literature circles in the classroom.  Parents should be encouraged to read this book with their children as a bonding experience of the discussions about family that will undoubtedly come out.	2002-05-30

This book is a wonderful look inside his mind where the reader gets to experience some of the feelings that such a child must go through every day.  Every teacher, and many students, can remember a child who was a good kid, but always out of control.  Joey was that boy and through this book many will get to see what they experience.<br />He is sent to Special Ed classrooms and even a special school.  His medicines cause him to go up and down and are never quite right.  He realizes the attention he gets for his actions so that is part of what keeps him going.  Joey is unable to concentrate though and at times his narration of the story is a little bit jumpy to reflect that.<br />I expected this book to be used well in classrooms to help understand ADHD with all students.  The students are in the regular classroom and educators should treat it as any other disability.  The only way to have people be comfortable with is to introduce them to it in a positive way.  ...<br />Why 5 stars?:<br />This book has a lot of potential to be used to help children and teachers understand the difficulties a student with ADHD must face.  However, I'm disappointed that it does not seem as though it is being well (judging by some of the other reviews on this page by children).	2002-05-26

This book is from 1951 and a little bit dated, but the theme is clearly seen and timeless.  Ellen is a sweet girl who is a little unsure of herself.  She meets a wonderful person, Austine, who makes a friendship with her immediately.  The girls become best friends and are very happy.  However, as tends to happen with girls in fourth grade, they have a quarrel and are no longer speaking to each other.  It takes each of them swallowing their pride to rekindle their friendship.<br />This book serves as a great example of how friends should act with each other.  Repeatedly, Austine is able to see the desires of her best friend and ask questions to bring attention to Ellen's show and tell, or divert attention to keep her from getting embarrassed.  When they do have their argument, we see the pain that both of them felt and how they were able to save it with a simple apology and talking through what happened.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Beverly Cleary has written many books that kids can really relate to.  This one is no different as it teaches kids how to make friends, behave loyally towards them, and how to keep them.  Moreover, it is entertaining and the theme, while clear, does not dominate due to careful writing.  This belongs in the library of elementary classrooms, though it understandably would appeal to girls much more than boys.	2002-05-23

The book is dedicated to all children of the city.  The format is appealing and interesting, especially the artwork which was created by using pastels and collage techniques over actual photographs of Harlem and Brooklyn, New York.  The text is a poem that describes the cat's journey.  So many books today are set in a middle-class neighborhood; this one shows images of more diverse settings that are most likely from a lower socio-economic class.  Some slang words are used as well.  For instance, \\"tag\\" is a term for graffiti gang symbols, and \\"projects\\" when speaking of housing projects and \\"bodega\\" are all words that appear.<br />The words and images of the book may appeal to some, but could leave others wondering.  Children, and teachers, who have never lived in the city, may not be familiar with housing projects or playground cages.  The book may help others to understand how city-life is different, but at the same time, it may drive a wedge between them.  I did not see how this book would help people to integrate these societies in any way.  If anything, it just showed what the differences between urban and rural or suburban living are without attempting to show any similarities between the areas.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>The illustrations were interesting and the poem well written.  However, this book, when compared with other children's literature on the market, simply does not stand up to its competition.  It has a target audience and I don't feel that it would really apply to students who were not in an inner-city school.  Therefore it loses appeal for me as a teacher.	2002-05-23

First, I had to go searching to find out which culture it was representing.  Second, there was no background about the Mexican celebration of Christmas.  In a way this was a good thing because it did not make the characters any different from anyone else; they were not a \\"minority\\", but simply people.  However, I feel that American schoolchildren would have a hard time understanding what was happening in the story.<br />Familial bonds and magic of Christmas were a focus however.  These are things that many people in the world can relate to.  Because nothing was explicitly taught, it did not make the culture a novelty. But it did not ignore it either.  I wish more \\"multicultural\\" books were done this way.  The impact is effective, but no hard-hitting.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Secret Stars is a nice story about family and the magic of Christmas that takes place within the Mexican culture.  However, the culture is not the dominant aspect of the book, which I really appreciated.  However, I didn't find the book to be incredibly interesting or useful in the classroom.  It does have a place and could be helpful with Mexican immigrant children.	2002-05-23

After sailing for over a year he returns to his room and finds his supper waiting for him and it is still hot.  This is a lovely story of how one's imagination can take him any-where he wants to go.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book was an instant classic when it came out nearly 40 years ago.  The illustrations are wonderful and appeal to every child with any sense of imagination.

The story is rather simple and tells about a young boy who awakens one morning to find his entire world covered by a blanket of snow.  He then goes out to play in it.  When he is getting ready for bed that night, he wonders what happened to the snowball he left in his pocket.  The text is fairly easy and could be read and understood by first graders.  Younger children may enjoy the story and discussions of snow and weather.  All children and many adults as well, could benefit from seeing Keats' art style.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>This book simply failed to grab the attention of both myself and the several different classrooms of kindergartners through second graders that I read it with.

Still he persevered and spent his family's entire savings on a specialized camera.  Over time, he be-came the world's most0recognized authority on snowflakes.  His photographs became parts of many university collections.  This book is inspiring for children to follow their dreams.  As well, it presents a lot of factual information.  The illustrations are decent and complement the story adequately.  They are picturesque and scenic, though human characteristics tend to be exaggerated.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>I found this to be an inspiring story that many, but certainly not all, children were interested in.  There are a lot of additional factual notes in the margins.  While I found these interesting, many children were not sure what to do with them when reading themselves.  These notes are on a much higher reading level and were sometimes too difficult for them.  Still, the book is a nice introduction to the genre of biography.	2002-05-22

A cute story, though it is lacking a true beginning-middle-end, it could help children with rhyming words and the concepts of rime and onset.  The illustrations are clever, interesting and appealing.  They were created with carved woodblocks that were then dipped into ink and used like stamps.  The curious feature however is the element of line and the way it is utilized.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>There is no real story to this.  The rhyme is pointless and uninteresting.  It possibly could have better if it went somewhere, but it is quite short.  I considered using it for practice with rhyming, but the rhymes are fairly difficult.  I would pass this one up unless you are a true collector of Caldecott winners.	2002-05-22

This tells a cute story similar to the traditional version of Rumplestiltskin that is familiar to many of us.  The watercolor illustrations are the perfect companion to this text as they are subtle with their opaqueness, yet still tell so much by themselves.  Because the book deals with the devil and also some witches, it may not be appropriate for all audiences.  Due to the difficulty of the, at times, archaic grammar and length of the text, students shouldn't be expected to read this independently until the 3rd grade, but can have it read to them at a younger age.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>I felt the portrayal of the Devil in this story was an element that could have been eliminated.  The character could have been named something else or taken on a different persona.

The background information as well as the sheet music provided will enable it to be used in a much broader spectrum.  The illustrations, while not stunning, will definitely catch the eye.  Younger children may not appreciate the aesthetic qualities of the pictures or text, but will still enjoy the comical story.	2002-05-21

The boy we follow wants a bell from Santa's sleigh and gets it, but loses it through the hole in his pocket.  The next morning, the bell is under his tree with a note from \\"Mr. C.\\"  He and his sister can hear it ring, but not his parents because they do not truly believe.  The pastel drawings are beautiful and very realistic.  They have just the right balance of hard lines and detail with softness and subtlety.<br />I remember receiving this book as a gift from my father when it was new.  I was just a small child and I remember how much I enjoyed the beautiful illustrations and longing to receive that special gift just like the boy in the story.  Unfortunately so many years have passed that I don't think I could hear the bell either - except when I read this book.  It is truly a special gift in itself.<br />Why 5 stars?:<br />The illustrations are absolutely wonderful.  Clearly, one can see why this book won a Caldecott Award.  The magic of Santa Claus is brought back to everyone who reads this book.  A wonderful story to read to children at Christmastime - or any time of year.	2002-05-21

A boy donkey is out collecting pebbles when he finds a particularly special one that also has the power to grand wishes.  When he runs into a lion, he accidentally wishes himself into a rock.  He can't change himself back because he can't speak or hold the pebble in his hand.  His parents get the whole town to look for their son, but of course, nobody can find him.  One day, his parents take a picnic to cheer up and use their son as a table.  The father picks up the pebble, places it on the rock and now Sylvester wishes himself back.  The illustrations complement the story well without being too busy.  The animals take on human characteristics very well.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>This book simply failed to capture my attention or that of any of the children ranging in age from 4 to 9 that I have tested it with.  The illustrations have an opaque quality to them, but many things are outlined in black giving the book a cartoonish quality.  Many people seem to view it as a classic, but I feel it should be re-evaluated and put aside for much more appealing books.	2002-05-21

Frogs on lilypads have taken flight and begin to chase after birds, intimidate a dog and confuse a man eating midnight snack.  As morning approaches, the frogs return to their pond, leaving their lilypads and the curious detectives behind.  The story ends with the words, \\"next Tuesday\\" and the shadow of a flying pig.<br />I've used this book in primary classrooms.  It is a very cute story with only a few words.  It also provides a wonderful opportunity for children to tell or write their own words.  This enables students who cannot read yet to engage in a literate activity.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book tells a cute fantasy story with very few words.  It lends itself to having children make up their own text, which will support their emerging literacy skills.  The illustrations are incredibly lifelike and it is no wonder it won a Caldecott.	2002-05-20

Sara is a shy little girl who really has just two friends (one of them is her cousin).  Her mother is constantly pushing her to be more social and not spend so much time in her room, but Sara doesn't like people looking at her much less speaking in front of them.  This is why Sara is understandably upset about the upcoming play that she must be in.<br />On top of Sara's problems with public performance, she is having to cope with her best, and only real, friend moving away during the summer, and trying to get an epic poem the three girls have written included in the Guinness Book of World Records.  Unfortunately, they sent the only copy of their poem to a rather famous actor in England, instead of to the publishers.<br />This book does a wonderful job of showing how a young girl was able to overcome her shy behavior to get through a public performance without going overboard.  I don't want to spoil the ending, but I will tell you that it does not end with Sara getting bitten by the \\"showbiz bug\\".  This story is very real and I wish I had discovered as a shy young kid.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>I expected this book to be a comedic look at something embarrassing happening on stage.  Instead, it was about some children going through some very difficult times.  Students, teachers and parents are portrayed in a real manner too, not necessarily the models of good behavior we want to see, but how a person would really respond.  I highly recommend this book become a part of your classroom library.  I intend to use it with every shy kid in my class and wish I had discovered it earlier in my life.	2002-05-10

I am a firm believer that most books, no matter how bad the plot is, will help children in their reading skills. The writing style is not entirely bad, in fact the chapters are broken very well and leave cliffhangers, but that is about the only good thing about this book.<br />Centered on four 12 year old girls who are overly concerned with their clothes, hair and boys, the plot takes a while to pick up. When it does, many of the characters are just plain mean to each other and present poor role models. The notion that the lead character believes her teacher has a crush on her, even after she discovers that someone else was writing her the secret admirer notes she finds in her locker is disturbing.<br />Why 1 star?:<BR>This books only redeeming quality is that the chapters do fit nicely in the way they are broken up. Blair (or most likely her editor) split them well so they form episodes. However, the events taking place are mean-spirited and promote a sense of superiority, and the idea that girls can only think about boys, and their looks. This book creates a poor example for developing young women and has no place in school libraries. There are much better books out there that girls will enjoy just as much and will probably get something out of: Flying Solo by Ralph Fletcher and Secret School by Avi, just to name two. E-mail me if you want a list of more.	2002-05-08

Fourth grade is a time when many students are looking for an identity that will carry them through their schooling years and into their adult life.  This book does a good job of showing how a child can cope with the situations around her and become a stronger person.<br />I did have a few issues with the book however and that is what dropped its rating.  While it is short enough for third graders, I would be reluctant to give it to students younger than fifth grade due to some references in the text, including one to PlayBoy.  Some of the characters are VERY interesting and I wish they had developed more.  Some inconsistencies with numbers and several typos and typesetting errors plagued the book as well.<br />However, I found it a charming story of a young girl who copes with a bully, and the realization that her best friend treats her like dirt.  She is able to stand up for herself without hurting anyone else and know who her true friends are.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>If it weren't for some inappropriate references and poor editing, I would have given the book 5 stars.  It is not a fantastic book that everyone needs to read, but there is an important message told that may sink into the minds of a few of our children and help them to grow stronger self-identities.	2002-05-08

A biographical story of (at the time) a young woman thrown into cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz, this book gives a chilling look at the atrocities done to the Jewish people during the Jewish Holocaust.  However, most adults have heard all of this before.  There are better books on the subject out there and this one failed to have any sort of a personal grab.  Because the girl was older than Anne Frank was, most children will not be able to identify with her as much.  I don't want to be offensive in saying this either, but... it does tend to portray Jews as victims throughout - and the ONLY victims of such treatment, which is not true.<br />The subject material may be too much for younger readers.  Despite the short length of the book, which can be deceiving when deciding on its difficulty, I would not suggest this book be used with children younger than 6th grade due to its graphic depictions.  Children younger than that would most likely not be able to treat the story in a serious enough fashion that it deserves.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>The book is graphic, and short.  It should not be used with children in the elementary grades despite its appealing length.  The story fails to grab the reader in a significant and so becomes just another retelling of a familiar account.	2002-05-07

It is also one of the few books that I am keeping from elementary education program.  Fountas &amp; Pinnell are leaders in this area of educational theory.  Their research and work is cited and quoted in books across the field.  This is probably their finest example of the program they have designed.<br />These two professors have designed a literacy framework that really works.  It keeps kids interested in reading and learning, while not being too difficult for the teacher to implement or to assess.  The book is so well written - there are guides everywhere and the illustrations and diagrams are actually useful (not just taking up space)!  I highly recommend this book for any and all intermediate teachers.  Many of their concepts can be adapted for older or younger students with relative ease.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>I have seen the ideas of Fountas &amp; Pinnell and it really works.  Of course, they have designed a utopian classroom in their book, but it is possible to achieve a strong literacy framework with the help of this book.  I know I will be using it.  They are up on their research and have designed a program that will keep student, teacher and administrator happy.  There are even sections on how to deal with standardized tests and &quot;struggling readers.&quot;  Every intermediate should own this book!	2002-05-07

It was somewhat entertaining, but failed to have any sort of hook to really grab the reader's attention.  Furthermore, I felt the suspected deaths of several adults and pets to be a little scary for the youngest on the age spectrum for this book.  I wouldn't give this to any child younger than fourth grade.<br />Three youngsters join forces to investigate the disappearances of neighborhood pets and eventually neighbors themselves.  They stumble upon a slime that is consuming the area, but of course, nobody believes them and they must fight it on their own.  There is quite a bit of factual science mixed into this book which saved its rating slightly.  There is nothing inherently bad about this book, but nothing all that great either, which is why I left it in the middle of the range.<br />Why 3 stars?:<br />I have nothing overly positive or overly negative to say about this book.  It was so-so.  I wouldn't give it to children younger than fourth grade due to the subject material.  The science is easily separated from the fiction.  This is a mediocre book, but if it interests a particular student then it is worth having around.  But, it is definitely NOT one to go run and grab off the shelves.	2002-05-07

The story was simple and a little too predictable - even for 3rd graders.  Its redeeming quality is that it may strike a chord with certain students and get them to read.  There wasn't much to a story of two little girls who get locked into an old mansion that had been converted into a children's library.  Naturally, this happens during a huge blizzard.  The old woman living upstairs get hurt and the girls must take care of her and figure out a way to alert someone they are there.<br />A series of events takes place many of which are not necessary, do not advance the story and are not even comical.   I would not recommend anyone purchasing this book for their children and/or classroom library however if you already have it, I see no harm in reading it.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>The story is simple, at best, and boring at other times.  There is nothing particularly gripping about the characters or themes of the book.  However, if it keeps a child interested in reading then go for it!	2002-04-30

The one thing you can always be sure of however is quality literature for young people that also appeals to adults.  I have always been amazed at how this lawyer from California is able to weave elements of his stories together and not ignore the details.  Little mysteries from the beginning of the story will make sense in the end.<br />Angeline is too smart for her own good and is not well like at school, until she meets a young boy who is sort of an outcast himself.  The two of them befriend a teacher who befriends Angeline's father.  The story was cute and I was able to relate Angeline and really felt for her.  I did have 2 problems however.<br />First, Sachar routinely talks about the things Angeline knew before she was born because she was connected to the world, but he does not explore this topic as much as I would have liked, or expected.  Also, I felt the suggested future romantic relationship between Angeline and Gary to be a little much considering she is only 8 years old.  These are both small issues, but they did prevent the book from getting a five star rating.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>With the exception of two flaws: 1 dealing with a concept not being explored fully, the other with content, this book was very enjoyable.  It is not the most open for discussion of Sachar's works, but there is still plenty to talk about.  I would recommend this book for intermediate students and their classrooms - it is already a part of mine.	2002-04-30

She loves to see and hear the story of the caterpillar that keeps eating and eating.  She loves the way the caterpillar was so hungry he seems to have eaten right through the pages of the book.<br />That is not just a feature that makes the book one more enjoyable, but helps in cognitive development and the concept of object permanence.  Because she is able to count along with the all of the things the caterpillar eats, and they are always on the page she understands the concept better.<br />Because this is a board book, it is durable enough to handle the abuse that toddlers can put a book through.<br />Why 4 stars?:<br />Eric Carle has created a masterpiece that will last through the generations.  The features of this book cannot be ignored and so, it belongs on the bookshelves of parents and caregivers.	2002-04-30
US	50681562	R14HONTOEB64SJ	0395873231	820874524	Flying Solo	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Solo	I loved this book!  I was expecting a trite comedy of what happens when some 6th-graders are left alone - similar to a Louis Sachar story of the Wayside School.  Boy was I wrong.  Each chapter begins with the time of day.  In this way, the reader is introduced to the first waking moments of several students who will become the important players.  They are immediately intriguing, from Rachel who hasn't talked in 6 months, to Bastian who is moving to Hawaii the next morning, and even Sean who's alcoholic father's girlfriend is barely older than Sean himself.<br />The day begins rather normally except there is no substitute who shows up to handle the class.  The children decide they can do it themselves and carry out the schedule as usual.  This continues for the next third of the book.  This was actually where I got bored and set it down for a while.  I'm glad I picked it up again - and I had stopped at just the right point.  When I began reading again it was like a different book.<br />The characters all of a sudden became so much more interesting.  Fletcher is very insightful and has created a cast of characters that truly will hold your interest.  They are so real you feel as though you want to meet them.  The experiences of the day become very stressful and these kids must face them as a group.  The book becomes a true testament of how intermediate students can be much more mature than given credit for when no adults are around.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>Fletcher's writing makes these kids real.  What's more - the problems they must face are very real.  This book shows how children can work out situations together and the importance of discussing our feelings.  It would be invaluable to start discussions in an intermediate classroom and will definitely be a part of my classroom library for years to come.	2002-04-30

This is one of the few textbooks that I am keeping from my Elementary Education major.  It was full of ideas of how to incorporate literacy experiences for your youngsters into all areas of the classroom.  As well, there were many ideas of how to get parents involved at school and at home to support their childrens emerging literacy.<br />Ms. Morrow is up-to-date on her research and practices.  This book is a good companion for any first-year or experienced teacher.  However, I do wish her writing style were improved herself.  The reader can get easily bogged down when reading some of these very long chapters.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Morrow provides some wonderful advice and information on how to best create an environment that will support the literacy of young children.  However, her own writing style could use a little bit of improvement to make the text a little more interesting.	2002-04-28

We should all have read about his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day already.  I also use this book in my classroom and have found that while the kids do like to hear another story about this adorable little boy, this story just doesn't click with them.  The success of Alexander's other stories came from the way kids were able to relate to his situation.  This book just doesn't have that.<br />What it does have though is a wonderfully planned out story and some good imitations of Ray Cruz's original depictions of Alexander.  Again, things just aren't going Alexander's way and his imagination begins to spin ways he can keep from moving with his family.  He learns his brothers and parents are much more understanding of his situation than he first thought however.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This book still deserves a place in your library, however it can't compare to the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.  Still, children will enjoy hearing another story about Alexander and if any of them have moved or are moving, they will get even something more out of this cute story.	2002-04-28

Mostly when I just needed to fill some time, I would read this story to them.  They have always loved it - even the ones who thought they were too old to have a story read to them.  By the time I am halfway through it they are already repeating the familiar phrase with me and supporting early literacy skills.  The humor is enjoyed by all and the illustrations of Alexander and his brothers are just wonderful.<br />Everybody has had those days where nothing seems to go right.  The misfortunes of Alexander on such a day where he wakes up with gum in his hair - and that was the high point - will keep anyone smiling.  A nice little lesson is that the book does neatly wrap up with Mom coming in to save the day.  Rather, Mom comes in and tells Alexander that \\"some days are like that, even in Australia.\\"<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book has gotten me out of jams before when I needed to fill time.  Kids and adults love watching Alexander and the rough day that he has because we can all relate to it.  The kids are able to see themselves in Alexander.  The repeating phrase is one that they can all join in on.  The realistic ending of the book just adds to its magic.	2002-04-28

I found it to be a highly contrived story of a little girl who gets into a little bit of mischief. The girl, of course, takes on the appearance of a pig. The drawings are cute, and in my opinion served to show elementary kids that they can draw as well as a professional illustrator.<br />The story line was lacking and the organization of the text on the page could be confusing at times. Still, I found it to be cute enough that children would enjoy it as a read-aloud, but I still can't understand why it has achieved so much notoriety.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>While it is a cute book, the story isn't very engaging. The illustrations are simple (which I like) and do not distract from the story, though they don't add a great amount either. I haven't found it to be greatly received by schoolchildren when I have read it and seen it used in classrooms. Unless you are a serious children's book collector - I would pass this one up - the hype is bigger than the type.	2002-04-23

Taking place in a small rural Colorado turn in the 1920s, The Secret School takes a serious look at the educational values and views of women at that point in American history.  When the schoolteacher must leave town before the end of the school year, the school board decides to close the one-room schoolhouse rather than hire a new teacher to save some money.  Crushed by this news is 14 year old Ida who now will not be able to take her exit exams to continue on to high school in the Fall.<br />Ida, along with the support of the other 7 children of the school decides to become the teacher and finish out the school year.  As this is a small valley, nothing stays secret for very long and Ida and her classmates must face the music.<br />This book serves an invaluable look at the history of the area and also of education and the struggles for women's rights.  The superintendent wonders if girls even need to go to high school.  This book would serve a purpose in guided reading groups or literature studies in upper-elementary grades and on through middle school.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>This book serves an incredible purpose - it tells the struggles that women and educators have come through in the last 80 years.  I only took a star away because the book did not make the issues more important but focused on the plot more.  The plot, while entertaining failed to grab me as much as the questions about society.  Still, this book definitely deserves to be read and find its way into elementary and middle school classrooms.	2002-04-22

The illustrations were so beautiful I went out and bought it that day.  I now use the book when I am substitute teaching and the children love it.<br />The story is of a bat that falls into a bird's nest and is raised as a bat.  The differences between the two kinds of animals are explored and explained.  The comical episodes of a bat trying to live in a bird's world are done in an expert manner.  The book has a happy ending and afterwards there is a section of notes and facts on bats.  I have used this book to kick-off lesson plans on bats and birds, and also in planning a unit lesson on the rain forest.<br />If for no other reason, this book will appeal to your children, because every one of us has been in a situation where we felt we didn't belong, or we were embarrassed because we were different in some way.  Cannon shows children how they can be more like Stellaluna and find comfort in themselves and who they are as individuals, even when they feel like a bat in a bird's world.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book is worth buying simply for the illustrations.  But, the story is one that shows not only compassion on the part of Mama Bird, but Stellaluna learning she does not have to change who she is to fit in.  The information provided about bats at the end of the book is a great resource for children wanting to learn about the title character.  This book will make a great addition to any classroom or home library.	2002-04-21

I was, however, disappointed with this book.  The story was simplistic and terribly predictable.  I am usually able to turn to the illustrations to support the story, but this led me to another disappointment.  Hunt's drawings simply were very busy.  Good illustrations are able to tell the story by themselves, with no text.  Even with the text, one would have trouble deciphering exactly what these drawings were depicted.  The overall redeeming quality of this book is how it does present a Christian story and reminds all of us of the lowly life our Lord was born into.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>While Max Lucado's books for children are normally wonderful, this one falls well short of the bar.  The illustrations actually hurt the story, not support it.  This is, however, a book about the glory that is Jesus Christ, and does therefore deserve to be read and shared with children.	2002-04-21

This was the first book I have read by Paulsen and I have to admit I loved his style.  The text is almost poetic in the way that phrases will repeat to add emphasis.<br />When 13 year old Brian's plan is forced down in the Canadian wilderness, he must fend for himself for nearly 2 months.  At the same time, he is dealing with his only personal struggles, such as the divorce of his parents, the death of the pilot and his emerging adolescence.  Brian learns that his determination and perseverance will get him through this struggle.  The problem-solving skills he develops are also a key topic.<br />I would plan to use this book in my classroom in a literature study setting for 3rd-6th graders.  The book is appropriate as far as the material and is on their reading level.  However, I did take one star away because, while it was well written, I never got into the survivalist aspect.  I enjoyed the language and the themes, but not so much the basic plot events.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>While the book is beautifully written, I was never able to fully get into the plot.  I would still highly recommend this book be used in classroom settings for small groups, as there is much to discuss.	2002-04-21

The woman who was once Mary Poppins and taught the world to believe in fantasy and the power of their imaginations has done it again.  This book sends a wonderful message about keeping our imaginations fresh and the power that the youngest among us have to enter into Whangdoodleland - a place that disappears when people stop believing in it.<br />Three rather ordinary children ranging in age from 7 to 13 happen across Professor Savant.  He agrees to give them lessons on how to reach the magical place.  What he is really teaching them though is how to see the world in a different way.  They really do reach the land of the Whangdoodle and have many adventures while learning a lot about themselves along the way.<br />This book is filled with factual information as well.  Only one small piece has become out of date, concerning DNA research, since the book was written.  The rest is solid and very informative for intermediate grade students.  I have seen this book used for literature study in a 5th grade classroom and it worked marvelously.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This book should have no problem holding the attention of 9-12 year olds though it is quite lengthy.  The themes of using our imaginations and being creative are ones that are important for every age group.  As well, there is lots of factual information in this book.  It will serve well as a discussion starter and in literature study groups (not to mention it is also an AR book).	2002-04-14

We all loved it!  I was especially drawn to the idea of a boy running away from home and the family that didn't understand to live in the mountains of upstate New York.  He hollows out a large tree and makes a house out of it, with a deerskin for a door.  Now, as an elementary education major, we read a lot of children's literature and do the same projects we would have our students do.  I was just as excited to revisit this classic at 21 as I was at 11.<br />Sam Gribley moves out to the country to live off the land.  He has ideals and is a true naturist.  However, he cannot escape being noticed.  He gets lonely and befriends badgers, raccoons and even a baby falcon that he trains to catch food for him.  An occasional run-in with humans is inevitable though.  There comes a point when Sam is unable to live alone anymore and begins to crave human attention once again.<br />This is a good book about survival in the woods, and the pressures that every young-adolescent will go through.  The discussion starter questions are endless.  The big drawback for me was the ending, which I will not reveal you to now.  Still, it is worth reading even though you may be a let down in the last 2 pages.<br />Why 4 stars?:  While I do feel it is a good book that deserves a place in every intermediate classroom library, there are a few drawbacks.  The book is a little bit dated and the end is frustrating.  However, it is entertaining and appeals to the sense of adventure and mischief that is found in all of us.	2002-04-13

As a former religion scholar I found the subject interesting.  The revelations continue as the reader learns the God being seen by the little girl named Faith is a woman.  She gives the girl stigmata and the power to heal just by being near a person.<br />The story is clouded by a lot of subplots however and some confusing narrator switches.  Much of the story is told from the mother's point of view, but at times it switches to an omniscient narrator.  The mother, Mariah, has some problems, mainly stemming from catching her husband in bed with another woman - again!  A lot of attention is paid to Mariah's relationships and the careers of priests who have come to visit Faith.  These passages were always dull to me, as I was much more interested in the child visionary.<br />While this book does have a few problems it does have raise some interesting questions about religion.  For example, can a 7-year old Jewish girl be seeing a female God and experiencing the pains of Christ on the cross?  Does she have the power to heal?  Or is all of this just invented by stress and the need for attention?  Should she be taken seriously and venerated as a saint or ignored as a heretic?  Is it right for this little girl to be exploited by the media and to have hundreds of cult members descend upon her house to worship her?<br />Why 4 stars?:  The story was an interesting idea and done well, but it could have used some trimming.  This book rates high because of its questions and value in a discussion group setting.  I'm glad I read it...	2002-03-30

While this is obviously not a happy topic, this book explores it in a responsible and appropriate manner.<br />Culled from the real-life experiences of poet Ann Turner, \\"Learning to Swim\\" tells the story of a young girl on a family vacation who is molested by an older boy.  Each page has a separate poem that explores her feelings at a particular time.  The actual events are not related.  The only questionable language is a mention to \\"private parts\\".  This is what makes the poetry all that much powerful.  The images created are wonderful and the reader is able to get a glimpse into the mind that this child must have felt.<br />The reader will feel the same emotions as the girl and it sends a powerful message about how awful the exploitation of children is.  The reading ability is definitely Young Adult and Turner is able to relate this difficult subject matter to a level that is appropriate for this age group - boys and girls alike.<br />Why 4 stars?:  Really my only objection is that she did not write more.  While we see the events from the child's mind, I would have appreciated even more depth into her emotions, as well as to the other people involved - her parents, brothers, and even the perpetrator.  However, I did enjoy the poems, and could not put it down - I read it the first time in a single sitting, and then had to go back and read them again so the full levity could hit me.  Turner does a masterful job of exploring this tragic subject in a manner that is appropriate for adolescents.	2002-03-30

This was a nice little story about Robbie who wants to start off the new school year the right way.  He begins to make a list of things he must do to make himself cool, such as getting jeans and changing his name.  He is paired up to work with Bo, a bully who is repeating the third grade.  Robbie, get scared, but when he faces his mother and simply tells her he would like some jeans and that he can walk to the bus stop by himself, she agrees.<br />He has a revelation that people did not know what he wanted them to do unless he asked them to do it.  From then on, he had a new outlook.  For his first meeting with Bo, they hit it off and Robbie became one of the cool kids.  But, not because of his new jeans or that his mom stopped kissing him at the bus stop.  Robbie became cool because of the way he thought about himself.  A good lesson for all children at such an impressionable time in their lives.<br />This is a good introduction to chapter books.  The 13 chapters are dealt out over 69 pages.  All of the chapters are short enough to hold an elementary child's interest.  The illustrations are beautiful and really add to the story.  I would recommend this book as a way to lead children into chapter books and/or to begin a discussion on what being cool is, and the importance of self-worth.<br />The only thing I felt this story was lacking was some of the realism and consistency of the characters.  At times Robbie, Doug and Bo can be young for their age and then on the next page seem to be overly mature for the third grade.  Robbie's parents have also become caricatures.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Nice story, nice illustrations, good introduction to chapter books.  Wonderful way to introduce topics of coolness, bullies and self-confidence.  Characters can become somewhat unbelievable at times, but all in all a book worthy to be added to your classroom library.  This book also lends itself well for reading groups and read-alouds because the chapters are so short.	2002-02-09

As an actor and a teacher I have never had a problem employing dramatic techniques in the classroom, but this book was helpful even to me.  An overview of Pantomime, Improvisation and Reading &amp; Writing Scenes is provided.  There is also a general overview of the Dramatic Arts and advice on how to stage your classroom production as a real presentation.<br />The chapters are kept short, with lots of additional text boxes.  These boxes contain &quot;Notes from the teacher&quot; to give real-world examples of the techniques being described.  Throughout the book, more than just descriptions are given.  Stories of the techniques in use are very helpful in guiding the teacher to design activities for his classroom.  While this book did seem to focus on upper-elementary level activities, they could all be easily adapted to fit most any age level.<br />Dramatic play is very important for children.  Preschoolers learn through their play and any age group can learn by using their imagination.  The activities outlined in this book will cause children to not only show their knowledge of a subject, but to construct it into a new medium.  This extra thinking will help to solidify it in their minds.  Because they will have the chance to interact with it they can fully understand how a flower bud opens, or what it was like to hide form the conscripts during the Civil War.  Dramatic play is an invaluable tool in the classroom and this book's aim is to introduce it to your classroom.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>Heller keeps his chapters short and peppered with illustrations of his techniques in use.  There is so much that can be added to a classroom environment through the use of dramatic play as a teaching tool.	2002-02-03

This is a sweet little story that Max Lucado wrote for his daughters when they were all very small.  It's meant to be read as a bedtime story and serve as a reminder to young children that God created them and their parents will always love them.  I found it to be very basic however.  There is more that Lucado could have done with this concept.  The text feels like it is missing something.<br />The illustrations however of Toni Goffe are another issue.  Beautifully done ink and watercolor paintings add to that void that Lucado was unable to fill.  These illustrations are beautiful enough to enjoy in their own right.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>While I enjoy the concept of a bedtime book reminding children of how much God and their parents love them, Lucado seems to have left something out.  Goffe's illustrations help to make the book more complete however.	2002-01-27

This book was written in 1895 and according to the forward, was &quot;'lost' for nearly half the years since its publication&quot;.  After suffering through it I now know why.  The plot is dull and little background is given as to the reasons for the strike that the events do center around.  Many happenings are expected and do not help to keep interest in the story.  The characters are all underdeveloped.  After reading the whole book I still don't feel like I know who Andrew, the preacher, is; or why Stuart and Eric felt such a close attachment to each other and were willing to go to such lengths to keep their friendship.<br />The only redeeming qualities of this book are seeing a man commit himself to Christ and for a group of people to try to settle their disputes in a &quot;Christian&quot; manner - meaning through discussions and mutual respect (I don't see what is necessarily Christian about that!).  I was disappointed in Stuart's &quot;conversion&quot; however as it comes upon him very quickly, early in the book and with seemingly no impetus for it.  A friend tells Stuart that he has committed his own life to serving Christ and then the next morning Stuart is a believer and begins to do what he thinks is right in God's eyes.  The problem is it happens to quickly and we don't get a look at the thought process that led him to this decision.  In addition, a major character flaw in Stuart and the rest of his friends is they become very judgmental of those who are not believers and go so far as to think they are better and tell others what to do.  It was a struggle for me to finish this book as it was not only boring, but promoted qualities and behaviors that I do not feel are living God's way.  Perhaps these characters should have asked themselves more often &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot;<br />Why 2 stars?:<BR>This book should have remained lost and not rediscovered by its &quot;updater&quot;.  The plot is dull, characters uninteresting and they reflect ideals that are not as Christian as they touting themselves to be.  The only reason I gave it 2 is they did at least pray and ask for guidance from the LORD.  My suggestion however, leave this one on the shelves!	2002-01-13

We meet a lot of tired animals in the zoo who are trying to get to sleep when a baby bird keeps them up with his singing. So, to get back at him, all day long they make noise and cause the bird to miss his nap. That night, he is so tired that he doesn't sing and everyone is able to get some sleep. I had fun reading this book to some kids for nap time and they enjoying the silly repeating phrase \\"beebeebobbi\\" - especially when I said it the way that all of the different animals would. I did have to take a star away because at times the text can be difficult to read - especially for beginning readers who are trying to follow along while reading over your shoulder. Also, it can be a little bit too exciting when trying to get children to settle down for a nap.<br />Why 3 stars?:<BR>A fun book with some funny moments, but some of the text can be difficult to read. Parts can be a little too exciting when trying to have kids fall asleep. All in all, a good book that should be used carefully.	2001-12-29

That is what I did, and then I went back and read it again.  The message of the story is two-fold.  First, to remind us that the first Christmas gift ever given was not wrapped up and placed underneath a tree, it had nothing to do with St. Nicholas, but it was placed in a box.  That gift was the Son of God that He gave to us because he loved us so much.  God knew what was going to happen to his son, but he gave him to us anyway so that we would be saved from the devil.  The second lesson was learned by the father in this story - to spend less time at the office and more with his family.<br />There were times when I had to wipe away the tears while reading this book.  It really is very touching to see how an old woman adopts the family she has hired to take care of her aging mansion.  In return, they grow quite fond of her and share many things with her.  She shares her Christmas Box however and reminds the family what the true meaning of Christmas is.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>A very touching tale to remind everyone what the true meaning of Christmas: because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that all who believe in him may not perish, but have eternal life.  The tale is just the right length - easily read in one or two sittings.  The lessons apply to all seasons and this book should be read all year round, not just at Christmas time.	2001-12-29

I first read when I was in middle school and now that I am in college I enjoyed it again.  I had forgotten completely what the story was about, as an education major I fell in love with it.  The main character is Bradley Chalkers the boy who nobody wants to sit next to and is referred to as a monster by his classmates.  He begins seeing the school's counselor and is able to work through some of his problems and becomes quite popular.<br />There are two great lessons to learn from this book.  First, that no children are bad.  Because of a series of misunderstandings, Bradley has become the victim of a lot of cruel jokes and had a reputation made for him.  Children will live up to the expectations of them, so when everybody expected him to be mean and not do his work - he didn't.  His counselor, Carla, was able to see through that and accepted him for who he was - a very nice and thoughtful little boy.  I wish all troubled children could have someone as wonderful as Carla in their lives.  The other lesson is one for all of us: when asked why he always says Hello to people if they say it to him, Bradley's friend answers: \\"When a person doesn't say hello to someone because he thinks they are a monster, it makes me wonder who the real monster is.\\"<br />The only reason I took a star off of this book was for the content.  I am a bit of a prude so the things that I thought were a little bit inappropriate may not be so for you.  There are references to people \\"making out\\", and when Bradley is at a birthday party he \\"likes watching the girls do somersaults because he can see what's under their skirts\\".  There are also many references to Bradley and Carla having a closer relationship than they should, i.e. kissing and Bradley fantasizing about marrying her.  Of course, none of this happens, but the subjects are brought up.<br />Why 4 stars?:<br />I really enjoy the story and know for a fact that it works well with 9-12 year olds.  There are some wonderful lessons in this book: every child is beautiful on the inside, and hospitality goes a long way.  My only reservations are about the subject matter, but I wouldn't let it stop me from giving this book to a child of the appropriate age group.ell with 9-12 year olds.

I have now officially taken sides on the issue of this immensely popular series.  While I probably will finish the series, it is not worth all of the hype that it has received.  There are plenty of other Christian fiction novels that are better written, more inspirational and have characters that are more true-to-life.<br />In this 4th installment of the series, the story gets a little bit out of hand.  The events of the book of Revelation become very turbulent - lots of people dying in catastrophic events - and so many people seem to ignore the presence of God.  More troubling to me however was the way so many of the main group of characters suddenly became believers.  With no prior faith and comparatively little information they all of a sudden are giving their life to God.  while I feel this would be wonderful it did seem a little bit far-fetched to me.<br />The main circle of characters we are used to reading about seems to be all we get to read about.  I would have been interesting in knowing more about what the general population seems to think about the events in the book, but apparently the authors don't (or aren't creative enough to give life to the masses).  The characters don't seem all of that concerned about others either.  They are not evangelizing (with the exception of Ben-Judah) and are hiding their faith.  This doesn't make me want to be proud of my faith and would not convince an unbeliever that Jesus is Lord.<br />Why 3 stars?:  The series is losing steam.  Long passages could have been cut out of this book (and its predecessors for that matter).  The characters are getting more and more fantasized and less like real people.  A disappointment, though I have to admit I probably will grit my teeth and finish out the series.	2001-12-26

I don't know what I can say about his book series that hasn't already been said.  This book definitely has quite a bit more action than its two predecessors.  However, some of their actions are a little too extreme to be believed.  It is hard to imagine a world where people are NOT stirring up controversies and trying to expose our heroes for who they are.  Also, the text is written on a level appropriate for a 12-year old.  This is both good and bad.  While it can feel at times that the authors are speaking down to the reader, most people do not have the knowledge of the End Times that would be required to understand all of the nuances of the plot twists.  Also, having the book written on an easier does make for a fast read which is appreciated.  I feel this a good Christian novel, but it is not the only one out there - and definitely not the best.  I rated this book generously because it was an enjoyable read, but the series starting to get a little difficult to swallow.  Still, I purchased book 4 in the series today.<br />Why 4 stars:?<BR>While there are some flaws with the characters and the writing, this book is a good introduction into the world of Christian fiction and helps to bring the world of Christian media into the hands of believers and non-believers alike.

I don't know what I can say about his book series that hasn't already been said.  The book begins by all of God's faithful believers being taken up to heaven in the Rapture of the Church and everyone else being &quot;Left Behind&quot; to try and figure out what happened.  Of course, following the book of Revelations, there will be the time of peace, the time of war, the four horsemen of the apocalypse and the rise of the Antichrist.  We are introduced to the main characters in this first book of the series.  They are all interesting down-to-earth people, but they have a few flaws.  First off, they all came to know Christ VERY quickly after the loss of their families.  I would have expected a time of grieving and even anger at the Lord before they came to embrace him.  Also, the text is written on a level appropriate for a 12-year old.  This is both good and bad.

He has very creatively taken phrases of that prayer that we all learned as children to take on the characteristics of certain rooms in the Great House of God: the home that the Lord has constructed for each of us to share in.  While I have studies religions for several years and been a Christian all of my life, I never understood the prayer that I recite every night until I had read this book.  Littered with scriptural references, humorous anecdotes and even stories from his own life, Lucado illustrates his descriptions of the various rooms of God's house in a way that every one can understand.  This book provides a way for those seeking God to see what He has done for them.  and for those who already recognize Him as our Supreme Leader, Lucado gives a way to know him more.  There is even a Study Guide in the back to use this book in a small group study, or even on your own.  I would recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to know God for the first time, and for those who want to be closer to Him.<br />Why 5 stars?:<BR>This is a book that deal less with inspiration and more with an understanding of who God is and why he has done what He has for us.  Moreover, it does an acceptable job at explaining how we can get closer to God, because He wants us to be.  The reader will understand who God is, what He gives us, and how we can show our appreciation.	2001-12-15

The story took entirely too long for any real action to take place. The characters are weak. Gabaldon tries to give us descriptions of her characters to the point that we can actually feel we know them and would know how they would react. She then ruins it by having them respond in ways that do not fit with our previous knowledge. She does do a good job of transliterating the Scottish pronunciation in the appropriate accent however. The descriptions of the scenery are poor and she gives us no understanding of the whereabouts of the characters. I found the story to be uninteresting and slow to develop.<br />Why 2 stars?:<BR>The only redeeming qualities of this book were the setting of the Scottish highlands and one decent character, that of Jamie. However, the rest of the characters and the plotline were dull and uninteresting.	2001-12-06

First of all, I have read other books by Kate Duke and I must say that her guinea pigs are cute and I enjoy some of her drawings.  While Ms. Duke does a competent job of illustrating her books, she has no business writing them.  The Guinea Pig ABC features 1 page illustrations with a word at the bottom and a large letter taking up most of the page.  The problems however are that the guinea pigs, in their interactions with the letters, wind up blocking pieces of them.  This causes the letters to not stand out as much and the guinea pigs to become the central focus, and not the alphabet.  The larger problem however is the selection of words.  Many of the words are not in the vocabulary of children learning their alphabet.  I have field tested this book with over 100 different children in small groups.  It has not been well-received in any setting or by any group of children.  Too many of the words deal with abstract concepts that the children simply do not yet have a grasp of.  For instance, \\"E\\" is the word \\"empty\\" - with two guinea pigs looking inside an empty mailbox.  3, 4 and 5 year olds are not going to make the connection. \\"Q\\" is the word Quiet; \\"N\\" is Neat; \\"F\\" is Ferocious!  On the rear dust-jacket, Duke says, \\"the only research I did consisted of staring at Peaches, my little sister's guinea pig\\"... that is painfully obvious.<br />Why 1 star?:  This book is much too complicated for its target audience.  This was Duke's first attempt at children's literature and I do wish she had done some more research.  I am appalled that E.P. Dutton would even print this book.  The book attempts to teach both the letters and abstract concepts simultaneously instead of picking a definite focus.	2001-11-10

In \\"The Crippled Lamb\\", a young lamb by the name of Joshua is excluded from the rest of the flock because he has a crippled leg.  The rest of the flock leaves to go graze in another pasture for the day, but Joshua must be left behind as the shepherd does not think he will be able to make the trip.  As he is sleeping in the barn with his only friend, a cow, he is awakened by a mother giving birth to a baby.  Had Joshua not been born with a crippled leg, he would have been in the next pasture with the rest of the flock and not been one of the first to welcome this new king into the world.  The resounding message of this book is that God created each and every one of us the way he wanted us.  There is a reason for everything even if it is not apparent to us when it happens.<br />This book has tested well with 5-8 year olds.  While I felt the story was a little long, it did hold their attention.  The older children were able to read the story with minimal assistance as well - always a plus!<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>While this is a nice story with a good message, it lacks the usual warmth and depth that Lucado's books are known for.  The illustrations are not especially great either.  However, the story does hold children's attentions and does have a message everyone needs to know.	2001-11-04

The problem is it was not written from the child's perspective, but from that of a third-person observer.  Children in the primary grades have trouble thinking of their feelings as something that somebody else might have felt.  Many will have difficulty seeing this relationship.  This book could have benefited by switching perspectives.  A much more effective way could have been to have the child expressing her emotions through her thoughts, asking questions to her mother and receiving the appropriate responses.  Rather, this book shows a mother telling her daughter how to feel and not allowing the child to truly express her grief.<br />Why 3 stars?:  This book would have done its job much better by being told from the child's perspective as opposed to the mother's.

We being with 20 guinea pigs on a boat, ten fall off and the math problem of (20-10) is in large type across the page, we turn the page to discover the answer of 10. We then continue to subtract one at a time until there are no more guinea pigs left. The problems are written on one 2-page spread, while the answers on the next leaving time for children to speculate and figure out the answer. The numbers are written large and clearly with the characters even interacting with them. The correct number of guinea pigs is also present and it is evident how many, and which one is being subtraction.<br />This book has served me well as a good introduction to subtraction in my kindergarten class. I would recommend it for that purpose and for children to peruse on their own, but it is not meant for story-time.<br />Why 3 stars?: The book serves its purpose well and the drawings are cute and entertaining. However, the minus and equal signs can be hard to see and the page design makes the story discontinuous.	2001-10-10

She enjoys it when I read it to her, but it is even better to watch her 7-year-old brother read it to her. This book tells a tale of three trees that dream of what they want to become when they grow up. All three are cut down and used in purposes far from what they had envisioned of themselves. However, by the end of the story, it is clear that the way they were used is not only exactly what they dreamed of, but they were used in the way that God wanted them to be.<br />This book serves well when speaking to your child about what he or she wants to be when all grown up. It will serve as a reminder to them that whatever they do, God will be with them and guiding them. God will use them in the way that he (or she) sees fit.<br />My first reading of this book was to a group of 6 and 7 year olds at bedtime at a Christian summer camp. I had never read the book before (not something I normally do) and I was so moved by the story and beautiful illustrations that I began reading every night to every group of kids that I had.<br />I know read it to the kindergarten class in which I am an aide for at a small Christian school.  This is their favorite rest time story.<br />Why 5 stars?: This book, teaches an enduring lesson through its words and wonderful pictures. It is on a level that second-graders can read. Perfect for them to read by themselves or possibly to a younger sibling. I would recommend this story to anyone who has ever had trouble seeing God in his or her life. His work is not always evident to us, but it is always there.  I would also recommend the leather-bound edition for a niver presentation of the story.	2001-10-09
US	50681562	RQ25SI2GP8LET	0446603422	396091677	Stormy Weather	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Hurricane Weather	Stormy Weather is right on par with the rest of Hiaasen&#8217;s works of Southwest Florida.  As very-realistic fiction it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether the events taking place could actually have occurred or not.  But, then sadly, the reader is returned is returned to the ever-present fact that these stories are completely fictional and could never occurred as the characters do something absolutely irrational.  This is true of many Hiaasen novels and Stormy Weather is none the different, however it is not as prevalent in this novel as in say, Native Tongue, or Tourist Season, making this book slightly more readable than its predecessors.<br />The redeeming factors of this book are of course the subject material.  Set in the after-math of a nameless hurricane (though an astute reader will not the date of publication as following Andrew, as well as the author thanking Hugo, Donna and Andrew, among others), the book centers around a few con-artists trying to make a quick buck scamming insurance agencies and what-used-to-be-home owners in their frantic disheveled states of mind.  Also thrown into the mix are a newlywed couple, the husband of which drives down to Miami to videotape the carnage for profit and is kidnapped by Skink (a returning character from previous books), a former governor who now chooses to live among the mangroves and .  When his better half becomes disgusted with his behavior she is not so frightened by the situation as she falls in love with a local man who juggles human skulls for entertainment.  Also returning from previous Hiaasen works is the character of FHP trooper, Jim Tile.  Mix all these elements together with the massive corruption running rampant in South Florida&#8217;s government structures, a couple of prostitutes, the melee of African lions, Rhesus monkeys and other wild animals being set loose in post-Hurricane Miami, Santer칤a deities along with a crucifixion and you have a formula for a fast-paced novel that willkeep you flipping the pages.<br />Why 4 stars?:  I would have rated this book only a 3, but its redeeming factors include the return of Skink and the constant jumping between several different plot lines knowing that at one point they will meet up.  However, the sex scenes and the comic violence begin to get a little wearing on me.  This book is just as funny as any other Hiaasen book and fans will appreciate it, but it is definitely not for everybody.	2001-08-14
US	50681562	R2CVBAJS91GDDC	0820010189	593905551	The Story of Florida's Seminole Indians	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Outdated and offensive	Please note that while the second edition of this book was published in 1997, the first edition came along in 1956 and the text has not been updated accordingly.  In its day I suppose this book would have served its purpose well.  That purpose being to expose white settlers to the presence of Florida's Seminole Indians; to show them these Indians were not violent savages, who needed to be feared, nor were they uneducated ruffians living in the Everglades, the country's marshiest swampland by choice.  However, that day is 45 years or more gone by.  Now, this book is outdated and definitely serves as a sign of the times it was written in, referring to the Seminoles as \\"social outcasts\\" and implying that their ways are uncivilized.  However, the reason I scored this book so high is because it does contain a lot of historical information about the early migrations of the Seminoles into Florida.<br />Throughout the book, Neill, places the time constraint on claims and comments of \\"now\\" which is of course immensely outdated.  Because of the books age, one cannot apply any of Neill's comments to the present-day situation of Florida's Seminoles.  But, his research can be helpful when wanting to know more about the history of the Seminoles.  For that reason and that reason alone does this book score as high as it does.<br />Why 2 Stars?: While this book is very dated and may accidentally provide some readers with misinformation as to the current situation of the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida, it does also contain some very useful historical information.	2001-08-02

Paley once again turns out a superb account of her observations as a kindergarten teacher.  In &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, Paley focuses her attention on gender.  She experiments with changing the way they play and in their P.E. classes.  She comes up with some very good points about both the differences and similarities in young boys and girls.  Most importantly though, she tells how play is the work of young children and the way that boys and girls approach that work in different matters.  While she is speaking about gender issues, she is careful not to over-generalize because there are always exceptions to the rules of a classroom.<br />Why 4 Stars?: I have always enjoyed Paley's books and her comments about the development of kindergarten children.  She truly has a gift for getting inside the minds of 5-year olds.  Her books serve as a guide for teachers, parents and any adult who has any interaction with children.  Many of her statements can also be applied to adults and the society at large not just her classroom.	2001-07-09

When a rogue newspaper columnist (who bears a striking resemblance to Hiaasen himself) teams up with three other misfits, including a Seminole Indian gambling mogul, an ex-Miami Dolphins football player and a Cuban terrorist, their plot to rid south Florida of all of its invaders from the North comes to fruition.  By targeting the Chamber of Commerce and tourists, as well as getting the news out that tourists were being hunted down, they try for the permanent mass exodus of Florida's towns that occurs annually the Monday following Easter Sunday.  Another ex-reporter turned private investigator is hired to track down this band of terrorists and return order to Miami and the Everglades.  It is not long before he realizes what his true purpose is.  Also adding to the cast are a bumbling reporter, the editor of the newspaper, a sultry love interest that becomes a triangle with one of the terrorists, a police investigator and a couple of Shriners.  What makes Hiaasen's books so enjoyable are not only his attempts to rid South Florida of the cancer's that have affected its beautiful landscapes, but also the characters he creates to do such.<br />Like many of Hiaasen's other novels, this book is a satire of the current problem of invasion in South Florida.  However, this book does not share the same amount of comic violence that some his other works (such as Native Tongue) do.  Because of that is more realistic.  The ending is a little bit weak, but it does come as a bit of a surprise and is definitely symbolic of the struggle these characters are facing.	2001-06-16

This book tells of not only the struggle of the Palestinian people who have been robbed of their land and heritage, but also about the enduring faith and selflessness of Abuna Chacour.  He has devoted his life to making a better life for Palestinians so that one day they may live side by side with the Jews.  He does not preach a message of hate, but rather one of love.  We are all God's children and should act like it.  If one responds to violence with more violence then the ugly cycle will never end....  but, enough from me, Abuna is able to tell these messages so much better...	2001-06-04

I was hoping for an account of the true-life kidnappings of several Colombian journalists in 1990 by a terrorist drug cartel.  Instead, what I got was a news story of the kidnappings.  This book was nothing but a narrative of the events.  Garcia-Marquez did not capture the raw emotions that he normally does.  This book had a very cold, remote feel to it.  Furthermore, it was full of allusions to Colombian life and events surrounding it.  Not having much of an understanding of Colombian history, I was lost in these passages.  Even with the author's descriptions and histories of all the various laws and coups that had taken place, I still could not make sense of it and became confused and irritated.  The only redeeming quality that I did find in this book is that Garcia-Marquez is a brilliant writer and he paired up with an excellent translator in Edith Grossman.  With this combination the book provides a good resource of talented writing - it is a shame that is clouded with a monotonous story.<br />Why 3 stars?:  While the story is rather uninteresting and is bogged down with long descriptions of Colombian history that are hard for Americans to relate to.  What boosts the rating however is the wonderful writing and subsequent translation by Garcia-Marquez and Grossman receptively.	2001-05-23

Like many of her other books, this is a narrative tale of individual events that have been strung together to show a common theme.  In this book, Paley focuses upon her art of having children create their own imaginative stories that are then acted out by the other children in the class.  She digs deeper though to watch how the children interact.<br />She tells of her observations and revelations that children are able to look past the minor defects and imperfections in a person's appearance or character and accept them for who they are.  It is somewhere along our journey to adulthood that we lose that ability.  Paley focuses upon the children and the actions that seem so remarkable to us that are so ordinary for them.<br />What this book lacks however is in-depth analysis of a group of children.  This is not Paley's fault however.  Since she has left teaching she does not have the time with a single group of children necessary to make such observations.  It is still a wonderful introspective on the way adults and children differ in our social interactions.<br />Why 4 stars?: This book tells a nice and interesting tale of Paley's experiences with several classrooms around the world.  She tells us of her observations of the why children are able to be unprejudiced and show true kindness to other children because they know no other way.  Adults, on the other hand, seem to do it out of necessity.  She reminds us that &quot;The moral universe lies on the breath of schoolchildren.&quot;  However, it would have been nicer to see some deeper analyses of groups and the individual episodes could have been strung together better.  All in all, this is a nice and inspiring book for teachers and parents alike.	2001-04-13

First, she is an example of how an experienced teacher treats the children in her care.  She provides new teachers with a model of how to encourage their students to explore new topics and to find themselves.  Secondly, Paley is very insightful as to the lives of children.  Her years of teaching have shown her many things and made her an authority on the minds of 5 and 6-year olds.<br />This book follows Paley and her students through her final year of teaching Kindergarten.  She makes the decision to read only books from a specific author for the year.  The author selected was Leo Lionni.  Lionni's books are read, presented and interpreted by the children.  One student picks up on the qualities of these stories more than any other - she becomes the Girl with the Brown Crayon.<br />The reader gets a good look at not only how a teacher can guide his or her students into a deeper understanding of literature and with that find lessons to be learned about life through the parallels that are made.  Paley also teaches her readers a lot about children.  But then, this is only what I saw - the author herself reminds us that &quot;Ultimately...it is the reader (italics) who interprets the writer&quot; (42).<br />Why 4 stars?: I have read several of Paley's books and have enjoyed them all.  This one is no different.  Her insights into the world of teaching, education and the joy of children are profound.  However, my only problem with this book is that I was not familiar with the Leo Lionni books discussed so heavily in the text.  But, don't let that stop you - there is still much to be learned from this text.	2001-04-01

The message is that our creator, God, loves us for who we are - he made us who we are.  Whenever we feel inadequate in this world, all we need to do is remember God's love for us.  When we do that all those negative things that people see about us and even those that we have started to believe ourselves will disappear.  This story is included in Lucado's book, The Book of Secrets.  This excerpt from that book is enhanced by Martinez's wonderful illustrations.<br />Why 5 stars?: This book is wonderfully written and illustrated.  The message is one that all children (and adults) need to remember.  God is able to see past what others do.  He looks not only at our surface, but what is inside.  He made us the way we are for a reason and he loves us because we are all so different.	2001-03-24

Centering on the theme park industry in South Florida, the plot introduces many characters with different viewpoints about the environment.  The hero is the voice in favor of saving the wildlife native to North Key Largo where the action takes place.  Living vicariously through his characters Hiaasen and the reader are able to strike a blow against land developers.<br />The plot takes on a basic \\"good guy vs. bad guy\\" scenario.  The \\"bad guys\\" are played out as the theme park that is more interested in trying to make money through their fake saving of an endangered species and the construction of a golf resort adjacent to the park.  The \\"good guys\\" are the natives of the area who are upset about outsiders coming into the area and destroying the natural beauty.  And a few psychos are thrown in for good measure - even a former governor of Florida.<br />Many times, attacks are launched upon tourists for being ignorant of the environmental concerns in Florida and just plain for being here at all.  For example, when one of the characters sits in the mangroves and shoots a rifle at passing rental cars while the FHP trooper ignores it.  Other times, the comedy falls upon the corruption of the politics and legal system in South Florida.  Many of the jokes can only be truly appreciated by those of us living south of Lake Okeechobee.<br />Added to his comedy is a political message.  Hiaasen is attempting to warn Floridians of the danger of the tourism industry and to invoke them to take action.  While he is not advocating the illegal and violent actions of his characters they are symbolic.<br />Why 4 stars?: This book really deserves 4 and a half, but I can't do that.  The story is wonderful and carries a great political message - one that I feel very strongly about.  The jokes are hilarious if you are from the area.  My only problems with the book are the language is a bit harsh at times and it maybe out of context for non-Floridians.  But, for local people this book is a winner.	2001-03-24

This book has a dual plot of interwoven stories occurring in the present and 110 years ago in the same location.  The parallels between the plot of long ago and the events of today are extraordinary.  In the past, a young man sold onions, which become very important to the plot later on.  The onion is a symbol for the book itself and for its central characters.  The book begins very bitter as people are very mean to Stanley, but as we get deeper we see a soft side to some of the characters and find a very sweet relationship between the two central characters.  The friendship formed between these two based upon sharing is a message for the way kids should get along.  Just like the onion, as we peel each stinging layer off we find ourselves getting closer and closer to a sweet core.  While some portions of the book are harsh, portraying some adult characters as being very mean, the focus is more on the choices that Stanley makes and the friendship that he forms with Zero.  I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 10.<br />Why 4 stars?:  I have always liked Sachar's books and this one continues in his same tradition.  &quot;Holes&quot; is less humorous than Sachar's previous works, but it has a very important underlying message: the value of friendship.  Because of its cruelty to some characters however, I would not suggest it for children younger than 10.  The only reason this book lost a star is because it can be very slow at points, which may lose children's interest.  But, all in all - a wonderful book!	2001-03-10

The editor should have taken out a red pen for this one.  Entire passages not only could have been, but should have been slashed.

The day he has chose is probably the second most stressful day that Jesus lived - only the day of his crucifixion would have been worse.<br />Through his descriptions backed up by scripture, Lucado portrays Jesus as both human and the Son of God.  A greater understanding of what Jesus did and why he did those things on the day that he fed the 5,000, turned away a crowd, was transfigured and walked on water.  It was a busy day for Jesus and his disciples.<br />By including many stories about common people, Lucado not only explains why Jesus did the things he did, but also why we do the things we do.  He draws parallels between Jesus and us to aid our understanding of our actions and his.  At the bottom of everything is that Jesus died for our sins.  In the final chapters, Lucado addresses the question: If God loves us so much, why does he allow us to sin?  The answer is simple: God gave us the choice to not sin and love him.  In order for God to understand the pressures of living a human life with so many choices, he came to Earth in the form of his son Jesus Christ.<br />Lucado also includes a series of study questions at the back of this book allowing it to be used as the curriculum for a study group or for personal reflection.  The questions are well written and thought provoking.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Jesus Christ.  It will help them to understand just who the man was.<br />Why 4 stars?:  I have always enjoyed Lucado's writings and this book is no different.  It is easy to read and always stays interesting.  The stories are easy to relate to your own life.  I have a few minor differences in our theologies, but nothing major, still that is the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars.	2000-12-19

Three children make friends with an elderly couple who have spent their lives devoted to doing God's work.

The book of secrets has the answers to all of the questions.  All the answers lead them to God.<br />A truly inspiring and uplifting book, parents should follow the authors' instructions in the foreword.  The chapters of this book are not meant to be read simply as bedtime stories.  Rather, they should be conversation starters for parents to instruct their children on how to live - how God wants them to live, and how they can have a relationship with him.

In the original &quot;Left Behind&quot; series LaHaye and Jenkins tell a story of what would happen if Christ &quot;raptured&quot; his Church today - taking all of his faithful believers to heaven with him.  In &quot;The Kids&quot; series the authors have made a haphazard attempt at adapting their story to a bunch of teenagers whom are all in some way connected to the adults of the original series.<br />I enjoy the adult series, but as a Sunday School teacher I have a lot of apprehensions about giving this book to children in the 9-12 age range that I so often see it listed as.  This book only gets through the first quarter of the first in the adult book.  The &quot;ungodly&quot; pasts of the characters is told to explain why they were not taken, but the story does not go far enough.  The book cuts off too early and never shows the kids themselves making the realization that their actions are responsible for them being &quot;left behind&quot;.<br />Be careful with this book.  It should not just be handed to children, but backed up by discussions with adults who have also read the book.  I would recommend using it in a group study however as the chapters are short enough that children ought to be able to read a chapter per week.<br />Why 3 stars?  I like Jenkins and LaHaye.  This book has merit and would be good in a group study.  But I found certain segments of the book to be \\"too adult\\" for nine year olds.	2000-12-02

She tells of her reactions when faced with a classroom full of children who are different from her.  By recounting her experiences as a child and reflecting upon them, she is able to better understand why certain children behave in certain ways.  These reflections, given in a narrative form, inform the reader of the thought processes of Paley.  Through these examples, one is able to better understand what the author was experiencing.<br />Paley's intention is to prepare future readers for the experiences she has had by giving the reader her reactions to them.  She tells the reader what worked to make a bad situation better, as well as what did not.  Most of the cultural differences Paley describes occur between her, a Jew of European descent and the African-American children in her classes.  However, many of the lessons and principles used apply to all children.  Her examples include children with different learning styles; comments taken out of context; children who are excluded from a group and those forming the groups based on a singular characteristic.  The majority of the classroom settings are in half-day kindergartens.<br />This is a wonderful book for anyone who has ever had, or will face a multicultural situation - that would include pretty much all of us.  There is an added value in this book for potential teachers.  Paley shows how to effectively validate children's perceptions of the world and make them feel value and self-worth.	2000-11-06

The storyline of a man who has had his dreams stepped on his entire life now finally seeing them about to become a reality is marred by the trite stereotypical characterizations.  Several of the characters do not add to the story and their presence doesn't even make sense.  Further, the story just plain isn't interesting.  This is one I would definitely pass on.	2000-10-21

The third book in this wonderful series by J. K. Rowling, shows the best character development to  date.  The story has so many flips and turns you never know what is coming  next.  My biggest complaints about the prequels to this book was that they  were too predictable and I was always able to figure who the bad guy was  ahead of time.  Not in this book - it keeps you guessing about things to  the very end.	2000-09-10

I was not at al impressed with Sorcerer's Stone and did not understand what  all the hubbub was about until I had read the sequel.  The plot line is  much better, thought the final scenes are a little weaker.  The character  development is also much better.  One of my favorite things about this  series is the three main characters, Ron, Hermione and of course Harry.  They really do interact as though they were 11, 12 and 13 years old.	2000-09-10

I did not at all expect to enjoy this book at all, in fact the  only reason I read it was so that I would know what my students were  talking about.  My suspicions were confirmed - this book is not great  literature.  However, it is a wonderful story that says a lot about 11 year  old children and the world they live in.  It is no wonder that it appeals  to kids of this age.  With all of the fads in the past few years it is  refreshing to see one that is actually beneficial to children.  While the  literary value of Rowling's book is not great, the fact that millions of  children (and adults) have read and re-read her books says a great deal.  Kids that otherwise would never read anything have picked up these books  and love them.  While this was decidedly not my favorite book, and I came  into with poor expectations, it was good enough to get me to read the next  book in the series (which I loved!).	2000-09-10
US	50681562	REZGEY1484WJ	0800790960	775483268	Blood Brothers	Books	5	93	104	N	N	A fair account	This book is a very touching recount of the life of a Palestinian Arab and  his memories of being expelled from his village when the Jews took over  Israel and the hardships that took on his life after the fact.  While  Chacour does give these painful accounts of the life he has had to face, he  in no way is bitter or hateful because of them.  On the contrary, he offers  possible solutions to the conflicts while explaining his side of the story  and providing a great deal of history.  Chacour tells his readers about the  prejudices that were placed against him by the Jews in Israel and Europeans  or all religions.  He was made to leave the home he and his family had  known for thousands of years and then had to read in history books that it  never happened!  He explains how these experiences led him to God.  The  story then moves on to explaining his struggles with the Israeli government  to gain rights for his people.<br />I have had the extreme honor of meeting  Elias Chacour after I read this book.  I stayed with him in his village of  Ibillin in Galilee.  While there we spoke every evening, often late into  the night about the struggles and hardships that both sides have faced in  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  He is very committed to doing everything  he can to better his people's situations while also defending the Jews and  their claim to the land as well.  He in no way is anti-Israel, or anti-Jew.   As he says, we all come from the same God, from the same Mother and  Father, and from the same land.<br />I saw the ruins of his village, which he  is not allowed to move back to.  I saw the graves of his mother and father.   I saw the church that he describes so well as the place that saved him.   But, more importantly, I saw a new side of this conflict.  I no longer saw  the Arabs as savages and terrorists that were trying to steal the land from  the Jews, but rather as a race of people who is enduring the same  oppression that the Jews faced for centuries.<br />Elias Chacour is a holy man  who just wants peace between these two races.  This book is telling a side  of the story that so often is hidden from the Western World.  If you a  person who is interested in opening his/her eyes to the real issues that  are stopping peace from becoming reality and not just an ideal - then you  need to read this book.	2000-09-08

We used this book as one of our textbooks for a course on  biblical literature.  Beal is a true feminist and an excellent biblical  interpreter.  His findings in this book show that the gender issues and  other prejudices that plague our modern day society have their roots  thousands of years before us.  By using the book of Esther as his main  source, Beal shows that a biblical book is capable of holding just as much  injustice as others hold justice.  I would recommend this book to any  feminist, or anyone interested in fighting prejudices of any kind.	2000-09-07

I read this book for a  course in religion.  We studied the world and belief system that Hoban has  created in this post-apocalyptic world.  It takes a while to get into the  garbled speech of the inhabitants but there are so many references to  things we do as humans that are causing the downfall of our society that it  may just wake some people and get them to change their ways for the better.   There are many lessons to be learned from this book.	2000-09-07
