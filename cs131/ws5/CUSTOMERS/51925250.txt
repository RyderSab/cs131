The idea that some foods are better than others is not new, but there are some foods, it turns out, that are especially beneficial and we should make a concentrated effort to include these tasty foods. <br />The book discusses the difference between macronutrient type of analysis (protien, carb, fat...) and micronutrient (antioxidants...) analysis and shows how some foods are loaded with healful micronutrients while others are not.<br />The book describes the main superfoods (beans, wild salmon, broccoli, blueberries, tea, ...) AND importantly many substitutes or related foods to these super good ones.<br />There are menus, shopping lists, nutrient analysis, and overall great down-to-earth discussion and information. An excellent and simple but elaborate guide to the SUPERFOODS we have heard so much about but before this book didn't know what it was all about. <br />I also can't recommend enough a remarkable book about authentic wellness called &quot;Effortless Wellbeing&quot;. Where has this book been been all my life was all I could say after reading it. Simple, to the point, includes simple mental and physical exercises and various ideas that produce wellness naturally. Amazing reading, and a great addition to the purchase of &quot;Superfoods Rx&quot;. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	2004-02-02

Covers everything but concisely, including exercises, myth debunking, principles and laws, eating, and the like. One of the best books there is on redefining your lifestyle to be fit and strong. His cookbook Eat for Life is also great and similarly attractively produced. Also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED is the book 'Effortless Wellbeing' by Evan Finer. That book will compliment 'Body for Life' nicely because it covers material that is different though related. LIFE CHANGING and GREATLY BENEFICIAL MATERIAL HERE!!	2004-01-31

Makes useful distinctions between left and right brain strengths and how to make optimal use of each. Overall a very excellent book that brings a fresh look at a potentially stale topic: thinking.

Dr. Phil's Diet book is very sensible and interesting, with psychological pointers and food considerations.

The guide is thick, with a lot of items and information. I strongly recommend to dieters that you also read Effortless Wellbeing by Evan Finer, a book that will help you feel better overall, at every stage of your weight loss journey.

There is a beginning strict phase and then a more laxed phase like Atkins. This seems more sensible than Atkins though. There are less hunger pains on this diet than other types of diets and the fat comes off fast. Good small guide for a great diet. I recommend to anyone who is trying to lose weight (or make positive changes of other types) the amazing book &quot;Effortless Wellbeing&quot; by Evan Finer.

This book and Cd help you meditate, or find the silence in the gap between thoughts. He teaches you how to do it and also puts it in the context of of experiencing god. His words and voice resonate with warmth and generousity and this book/cd is worth every penny. I also recommend his &quot;10 Secrets&quot; book highly (as well as most everything else he writes). Another book that is exceptional at helping you become well, to experience deep wellness, is &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer.

Few books are as capable as this one of producing deep learning to the open and calm reader. Simply excellent! It is also worth noting that this book can and should be read many times because the teaching will become bigger as you are more prepared from your experiences with the material. Another masterpiece of a book that can help you greatly in this area of personal investigation is &quot;Effortless Wellbeing&quot; by Evan Finer.

This is a special book because it has extensive information about a variety of causes for health problems, and how to correct the situation. It tells you how to make changes to prevent problems. It tells you how to get tests performed to see where you are at with certain risk factors--this was particularly useful because some assessments are not &quot;traditional&quot; enough for the average doctor to immediately know how to get the test done and you'll need to know what labs do them. The food lists are excellent, to let you know what is best, next best, least good.... A ton of useful information from reputable authors, about health issues that are important but often undervalued by mainstream. A very interesting and useful book. Also highly recommended with this book is &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer. Effortless Wellbeing will provide a concise program of mental and physical exercises, and some potent principles, to help you further your overall wellness.	2004-01-23

All the &quot;Weil&quot; providing analysis and explanation so that we feel informed and not just doing what he says. Highly recommended book!

I also recommend a book that has additional similarly concise and powerful information, a slightly different perspectice, and some really great how-to exercises.

All of his books are filled with the greatest lessons there are, woven within great and uplifting stories. Most of his books are bigger than this one, with a lot more elaboration. Yet, I love this little book and found it as powrful if not more powerful than many of his other bigger books. It really is a must read. I'd like to also say that, having had the opportunity to sit a few feet from Dr. Dyer at a seminar (actually about this title), he is an extremely humble, warm, funny, and generous person. There is a lot more to his teachings than a lot of people think. Whether you have read his other books or are thinking of this as an introduction to Dr. Dryer, this is a great choice. Makes a fantastic gift. I also highly recommend a book called 'Effortless Wellbeing' by Evan Finer. It has great ideas like Dr. Dyer's books, and also includes mental and physical exercises and how-to stuff.	2004-01-22

I also highly recommend &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer as a book that covers the how-to of wellness and now-ness in a very concise and potent way. Both of these books have depth and power and will profoundly help a person who reads with an open mind in a receptive state. They are good compliments to each other. Highly recommended!	2004-01-22

This is a book filled with very good ideas, some obvious and some not so obvious. It is better than many books about money because it is simple and provides strategies that are doable for many people-- like setting up an automated withdrawal of X amount from your check to go into a savings. Most people have not done these things because they have not been spelled out for them like they are here, with scenarios showing what small automated sacrifices can produce. The issue with the book, like dieting books, and other self-restraint ideas is that they are hard to do. How do we feel satisfied with what we have, and with self-imposed restrictions, while we work to improve the financial situation? That is the really hard part, and appropriately, is not a part of the book. I recommend this book but also that you read &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer. This additional book will help you feel better about wherever you are financially (or otherwise), help you feel better as you tighten the financial belt to make the future brighter. It also will help you be a more powerful creator of your circumstances in general, and thus empowering you to make more. I have been financially better and happier with what I have since reading and using the Effortless Wellbeing ideas and practices. High Recommendation of both titles to make yourself an automatic millionaire.	2004-01-21

Excellent Science Review of BIG IDEAS	This book was as good as nonfiction gets in terms of the &quot;can't stop reading factor&quot;. The author has a uniquely exciting way of mixing the biographical information about scientists and their lives with the exciting work they have done, and wrap it up with the implications for you in the real world. The ideas are HUGE here and even for a reader of this type of material (energy, vibrations, advanced theoretical physics, healing, psi, psychic phenomenon...) the book makes points that really help refine one's ideas, turn on a few more light bulbs in the mind. A great read for the information and because it is like a super exciting novel--captivating. I recommend also the book &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer because it will help you apply many of the theoretical ideas of this (and similar) books to your own wellbeing and personal effectiveness. Interestingly, the one book will help you to understand the other more deeply (the Effortless Wellbeing book will help you gain experiential knowledge of the ideas in The Field).	2004-01-11

The book is great, a very interesting discussion and explanation of human consciousness that makes sense and can be applied to your life. There is a testing procedure described in here that is used by many &quot;in the know&quot; but not so well known by far too many people. Called muscle testing (some use fancier names), this book teaches an easy way to answer questions that you would not know you can have answered. Like, &quot;are this person's motives to help me?&quot;, &quot;Is this person lying?&quot;, and really the sky is the limit to what you can ask. There is also a description of a scale of consciousness &amp; truth that you can &quot;calibrate&quot; people, places, things, etc., with to determine the level of quality of consciousness or truth. I heard about this book from Wayne Dyer, who also wrote a blurb saying it was one of the most important books he had read in several years. Dr. Dyer feels so strongly about this book that he sells it for his cost at his seminars. He is right to be so enthusuastice about it. It is a HUGELY valuable book that can make a HUGE change in your life. If you are wondering whether to buy it, BUY IT!! It is one of the best books I have ever seen on this topic and perhaps more importantly there are very few books on this topic that are written for the public. Also highly recommended is &quot;Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness&quot; by Evan Finer, as a great how-to book for feeling well in your life.	2004-01-10

The thing that makes this book different is that Dr. Phil lends psychological wisdom to the task of losing wieght. The dietary guidelines he offers, to me, are not as important as the various \\"keys\\" (other reviewers mention them). Used properly, these keys can make the difference. However, where the book lacks is in helping you to use the keys without struggle. That is, how can you feel good about where you are and where you are going, while using the keys. I recommend Dr. Phil's book for his good keys, and I recommend that you scan other diet books also to get other food choice ideas (South Beach, Atkins, Zone...). BUT, THE BIG HELPFULE SUGGESTION IS that you get a copy of an amazingly powerful book to help you feel good about whatever you are doing, to help you feel great regardless of where you are on your weight loss journey. The book is \\"Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingrediets for authentic Wellness\\" by Evan Finer.

Probably the most important thing to get across to potential readers (and those who merely read it without sincere attention) of this book is that it has the potential to help you create deep and meaningful changes. The author literally transmits teachings through his words, helping you on more than just a consciou level. Conceptually, the book is also very interesting, but it is an experienctial learning that you gain. Very profound book!
