This book is a must have for all D&amp;D gamers out there, despite the hefty cost.  Forgotten Realms players especially need it.  Contained within is a wealth of informaiton for 3rd ed D&amp;D.  A wide and varying assortment of new spells, feats, magic items, several new Prestige Classes (outstanding variety), descriptions and dogmas of many FR dieties.  But the true thing that makes this book irreplaceable is the descriptions of the different lands of Fearun.  Complete with populations, geographical makeup, leaders, backround information on powerful people, temples, groups, histories of many areas, and a brief description of what's going on in each area now to give the DM some adventuring hooks for his players.  Want some powerful NPCs to either aid or hinder your PCs?  Many are outlined here from Dizzt, Elminster and a few of the Seven Sisters to Artimes Entreri and Fzoul.  The artwork is simply fantastic.  Vivid and detailed each piece in the book describes the characters as I envisioned them (the first decent drawing of Drizzt I have seen as well), though Elminster's beard was a bit short for my liking.  Ah well nothing's perfect.  Forgotten Realms has always been a mystic and wonderful fantasy world, this book will only enhance your gaming experience.  Pick it up, despite the price tag, you will not be sorry.	2002-05-29

As a DM, I try to give my PCs as many options as possible character wise.  But one thing I have always forbidden was Psionics.  In AD&amp;D 2d Ed they were overpowered and inbalanced the game.  When I played with one, he could easily have taken out mine, when he was at less than half the level.  So, understandable, when this 3rd Ed D&amp;D book came out I was very, very sceptical.  I even banned the playing of Psions in my campaign.  But after reading this book, I must admit that the class has been stablized and a new very interesting class (that I want to play) has been added, the Psychic Warrior.  Thanks to this book I am now allowing Psions and Psychic Warriors in my campaign and am looking forward to one day playing them.  WOC did a great job with the classes and this book.  If you didn't like Psyonics before, I think after reading this you may change your mind.  Give it a look.	2002-05-15

They continue to pull it off, series after series.  This time they have resurrected the DragonLance Series.  Last Star continues with usual Weis & Hickman suspense.  Tying up a few strings here dangling more there.  Giving you just enough information to keep you hooked.  The story unravels across Krynn, skipping from one place to another with wonderful smoothness.  The changing of the guard goes full force as the Heroes of the Lance full pass on the reins.  Our new set of heroes are quite a rag tag bunch.  But then again...who are the heroes and who are the villians.  The influence of the One God sweeps across the realms.  As the elves fight for their survival, you wonder if the One God is on there side or not, and darnit WHO is this One God?  This story will suck you in and leave you gasping for the conclusion, begging for more.  This is a true masterpiece of fantasy that shouldn't be missed by anyone.	2002-05-15

Ever since the end of the Twins Trilogy (yes I am including Dragons of a Summer Flame) DragonLance has been a bit well, lacking.  But Weis &amp; Hickman may be turning things around with this enchanting novel starting off what could be an outstanding trilogy.  The One God has come to Krynn on the heels of a mighty storm, an old friend pops his topnot out of a tomb.  This is a truly enchanting tale, that just may save Dragonlance.  Written in typical Weis &amp; Hickman fashion, leaving you full of suspense throughout the book, you will be hard pressed to set this book down.  Those who are new to the DragonLance World would do well to read Weiss &amp; Hickman's earlier works in the setting, &quot;The Cronicles,&quot; The Twins Trilogy and Dragons of a Summer Flame.  Many of the characters who appear Fallen Sun are detailed in fantastic fashion in these books.  But if you don't want to read those, you can still enjoy this book (though you may be a bit confused as to who Goldmoon is, and Raistlin) but you will enjoy it.  I found this book rekindled my love for the DragonLance world.  Welcome back Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, please never leave us again!	2002-05-15

If you haven't read these books, or haven't read anything about the Heroes of Mythril Hall and you love fantasy or D&amp;D it is imperative that you pick these up.  These books pick up after the Icewind Dale trilogy, continuing the adventures of Cattie Bre, Bruenor Battlehammer, Drizzt Do'Urden, Wulfgar and, of course, the mischeivious halfling Regis.  As they transverse the realms, enduring harsh peril and great tradegy to come out on top.  Salvatore, the author, is a master of Fantasy literature, especially excellent in detailing fighting scenes (an essential part of fanasy writing).  If you are a Forgotten Realms fan or a Fantasy fan these need to be in your collection.	2002-05-15

Overall this is the best guide on the market, quite thorough and doesn't divuldge any of the plot line (which I love).  But there are a few mistakes in the book.  Several instances of deviations from the game and the book appeared (would love to go into more detail but I don't want to give any of the game away).  Another thing was it didn't tell you anything about some of the very small (but very important) things along the way, like near the end there is a situation between you and NPC and an Evil NPC and they don't tell you how to make it better (this NPC is very important to your character), they say nothing about it, quite annoying, and there is minimal mentioning of the stronghold quests which frustrating especially for the Paladine where you are forced to make extremely difficult decisions.  But all in all this is a fantastic guide with very useful tips for battling any and all monsters and bosses.  Lists of Magic items and spells, what each does and where they are (very helpful).  Key item locations and solutions to those tough riddles.  I suggest running throught the game once before you use this book, just to see how you do for fun, then making a run through with this book and see everything you missed.  At some points this book is an extremely valuable resourse, especially when trying to sort through the dozens and dozens of side quests (they can be overwhelming at times).  Excellent tool.  When you get stuck (and you will) you will be glad you bought it, trust me.	2000-11-15

Inside are several character sheets 1 for each  class and 1 for Multi classed, along with the authority to photocopy them  as needed for personal use.  These sheets will save you alot of time and  trouble, each lists every skill on the sheets whether you character has  that skill or not he is going to need a majority of them because a new rule  in the game allows you to use certain skills even if you didn't put points  into them.  D&amp;Ders pick these up they will save you a lot of heartache.	2000-08-28

Just finished reading the new 3rd edition Handbook for the D&amp;D game.  Wizards of the Coast have changed many things streamlining the game, making  it quicker and more fun. They have added several character classes each  with their own abilities, each largely different that 2nd Edition,  including The barbarian, monk, and sorcerer as well as retouching the old  character classes giving each new and unique abilities that make them all  interesting.<br />Included in the book is a list of gods for your people to  follow, they give mythos and what charater classes in the game would  worship who.  But if you are running a forgotten realms campaign I am sure  that you can incorporate them into 3rd Edition without much of a  problem.<br />Ability scores are also revamped, no longer is there a maximums  and the limit is endless, an adult red dragon for example has a 37  Charisma, and a 38 Strength.  And your PCs can get there too, with a little  work and a lot of role playing.<br />Gone is THAC0, and the addage  &quot;lower is better for AC.&quot;  Now with everything, including skills  (proficientcies), higher is better and AC goes up.  Also gone is demihuman  level limits, and class restrictions, you want a dwarven wizard...go for  it, a hafling paladin...done.  Anyone can multiclass, and duel class.  And  for both you choose which class gets the XP and when, and you get all the  benefits of both (all three, four, five...?) all the time no matter what  class you are going up in.<br />The changes that have been made have  simplified the game in terms of speed of play, but in no way have deterred  the thoroughness of this wonderful game.  You can now get a way with just  bringing a d20 and your damage die to a gaming session.  If you are a  D&amp;D player your eyes will light up with possibilities when you read  this book, you will not be able to wait to play it.  If you are new to  gaming and want to learn this book will teach you everything you need to  know to start playing 3rd ed. D&amp;D.  This is a can't miss.t playing 3rd ed. D&amp;D.

This may be the best  trilogy since &quot;The Dark Elf Trilogy.&quot;  This book was definitely  more action packed than the previous books but all those things that were  pestering you finally are revealed, like who has been speaking to Jherek  all these years and why, who Iakhovas is, and more. The Taleweaver's tale  comes to an end in dramatic fasion, and I am glad that the ending is  different than it was in the module because if it was the same then I would  have known the ending and that would have spoiled the book.<br />I found the  pace of the book more along the lines of the first, which I liked (the  second book was to slow and little was accomplished).  The battle scenes  were detailed making them easily pictured in your mind.<br />The best thing  aobut this book is the emotion.  You feel the pride in Jherek when he  regards his paladin friend and the sadness in his love for a young ships  mage.  Also handled quite well was Jherek's revival, taking down to his  lowest possible point, he was revitalized in magnificent fasion.  Truthfully and beyond a doubt this is one of the finest Forgotten Realms  series ever.  You will not regret reading these books.	2000-08-11

This is truely an excellent adventure, in the classic AD&amp;D style dungeon crawl format.  Deep and involved it provides extensive backround and good ways to use this dungeon in your campaign.  It will take some  skilled PCs to get through this adventure, as many traps and a curse lay in  thier way.  This will try the skills of even some of the best gamers  around.

Salvatore continues his story of the gallant Cadderly and the beautiful Danica.  This book takes the fight to Castle Trinity.  A great feeling sweeps through you as you read the book, as the group lays waste to the  evil minions of Castle Trinity, you find yourself wanting to cheer out for  Cadderly and crew to &quot;Kick their arses.&quot;  This book is classic  Salvatore, absorbing and exciting, you never want to put it down even  though it is 5:19 in the morning and you have to be to work in 11 minutes.<br />I found one small problem with this book.  Cadderly suddenly gains this  superior confidence and believes what he says is right and everyone else is  wrong, what ever happened to the Cadderly who weighed his options well.  The expanations did not sit well with me but they by no means distracted  from the book.  The highlight:  Ivan on his Magic Dragon Ride.  If you pass  this up you are missing out on the vengence book of the series.  Enjoy!	2000-07-12

There are very few fight scenes in this book which kind of kills the fantasy part of it.  But it is still good, more so because it  introduces the new characters to the story so people will understand what  is going on in Dragons of Summer Flame.  It helps develop the characters  for the NOVEL that comes after it so consider it a necessary prelude.  While I don't recommend it to the casual reader if you are a fantasy buff  you should pick it up if only to learn of the new players in the Chaos War.	2000-07-12

This book concludes the fourth age of Krynn and rushes it into the fifth age and to a ridulous [level].  But that is a different review.  This book is good, the plot was intriguing and the characters deep and agreeable (though Palin kind of ticks you off at times with his insatiable  whining).  Somethings I did find disconcerting about this book was that it  seemed rushed, and I too believe that the authors were forced into changing  Krynn in order for TSR to use a new game to base the books on (and in my  opinion souring the book a bit and ruining Dragonlance evermore).  But this  is an excellent read and maybe the last of the Dragonlance line.  Wies and  Hickman end Dragonlance 4th age with a flare few can...hopefully Dragon's  of a Fallen Sun with revive once mighty story line.	2000-07-12

All the while he keeps  hearing a strange voice calling to him in his mind.

Though the Sword coast is not a new setting,  under the sea is.  The plot is deep and involved and pulls you right in  from page one.  This book is a great start to a fantastic Trilogy.

The story of Jherek and the Sahauguin invaders continues in this well written book.  Odom continues to develop his characters well, even adding a couple of new additions to the journey.  A young paladin joins Jherek on  his journey after the item given to him by the priest of Lethander.  And  they end up at the Sea of Fallen Stars right where the old bard weaving his  tale just happens to have traveled to.<br />The series is shaping up to be a  fantastic one all in all, but this book was missing something compared to  the first book.  It seemed drawn out at times just filling space, like the  author ran into the problem of one group being here and the other there and  no way to bring them together, but he manages to pull it off rather well  and it doesn't destract from the book at all.<br />Despite what some  reviewers say this does not surpass the books of Salvatore.  Does it come  close?  I will have to concede that it does.  This is shaping up to be one  of the best adventures in the Realms in recent history.  Enjoy!	2000-07-11

There were things though  that I found not so great about this book.  The biggest thing was that you  don't relate to the charaters to well, as in, you are never sure what is  going on in there heads and that gets fairly annoying when someone say they  have been struggling with something for a long time and you don't remember  the point being brought up before.  The other thing is the lack of  suspense, there was a chase seen through the roof tops and I had trouble  rembering they were being chased, there was no danger felt throughout the  whole sceen.  It seemed like the characters were just frolicing around  without a whim.  These problems almost caused me to give this book a three  but after consideration, it is well written (especially the discriptions of  the city and the laws that hinder the charaters) and a page turner.  So  overall this is a very good read and I recommend it to anyone who has or  would read fantasy.	2000-07-10

This is a great book.  A lot of the loose ends are tied up leaving just one hanging, but enough of one apparently to continue on with the series.  Less full of action than the second book, but  it goes into great detail about Cadderly and his gaining power.  His doubt  as to what is happening to him, his doubts about his god.  This series has  been phenomenal so far, and I truly look forward to reading the rest of it.  Once again the Battle scenes are spectacular (do you expect anything less  of Salvatore?) but this time its Cadderly's turn to excel, the way  Salvatore discribes his magic is just sensational.  This series has gotten  better and better with every book.  Don't miss this one.	2000-06-20

How good could that be?&quot; But because it was Salvatore Iread and, boy, am I glad I did.  Cadderly is one of the best characters I have ever read about.  He fancies himself a scholar a priest who is not adept at the clerical magic of his faith...or is he? ...There are complaints about the ending, and I too must admit that it is not the most heartwarming in the world in was necessary for the transfer into the next book, just as Cadderly's Year Quest was for transition to this book.  If you are a fan of Drizzt and Salvatore's books then you will this book and series very ingrossing (I read the first three books in a day, I couldn't help myself) and extremely intertaining. ...Don't be dissapointed that everyone's favorite dark elf ranger is not in this series, Cadderly is every bit as intriguing.  IF you did not read this series because Drizzt is not in it then I beg you to reconsider you will not regret your decision.	2000-06-20

Lady Crysania's  struggles to answer the questions of her faith as Raislin attempts to reel  her into his darkness.  Tas appears less in this book that in the first but  he still makes major contributions and of course adds some fantastic humor.  Caramon superbly commands an army during the Dwarfgate wars, and we find  out maybe Caramon isn't as dumb as we all thought.  This story is told with  a stirring narative that, at times, makes you feel like death is walking on  Krynn.

It tells several stories each one takes place in a different time from the early sixties to today.  Each story is connected to the other in a subtle way,  but yet is a key to each story.  The stories are written each from a  different perspective, giving you a different feel with each one.

Just finished reading this book and found it quite different than the Chronicles.  But that doesn't mean it wasn't good.  A lot less action packed that the Chronicles, its battles are ones of the mind.  Each  character struggles with the choices that they must make, even Raistlin has  his moment of stuggle.  I must admit it started to get frustrating, I would  be thinking &quot;When is this ever going to go anywhere?&quot; then Tas  would say something that would break that frustration and the next thing  you know you have the next clue.  Tas goes through a change in this book  that is quite interesting.  Then it ends leaving you dying to pick up the  next book, even more so than the Chronicles.  If you enjoyed the Chronicles  and are a fan of either Raistlin, Caramon or Tas, then pick this up, I  guarantee you will nto be disappointed.	2000-06-07

As you flip through the pages you  feel like you are in the book, a small hidden charater who watched  everything go on.  You picture what each charater looks like in vivid  detail.  Salvatore does a fantastic job of conveying the whole feel of the  underdark.  The second and third books were equally as compelling, when I  finally got to read them.

After successfully attaining that high esteemed place, she was continuously was bombarded by mages attempting to destroy  her (and thusly quickly raised herself to phenomenal strength).  This  module does not tell you how to role play the magister...it tells you what  comes along with being the Magister, what you must do and a long history of  the Magister.  The people below seem to forget that Ed Greenwood created  Forgotten Realms and whatever he says goes.  Sure the Magister is a  powerful person but wouldn't it take a more powerful mage to take her down?  You see PCs who live long enough to reach high level should be rewarded  with such honors and that is what this book is for.  It is an excellent way  to retire a mage who has done everything.  The key to this module is how  the DM uses it not what the module says.	2000-05-25

This a good change of pace for those who need a bit of  change from regular D&amp;D.  I chose not to use the situations in the book but instead during one encounter made my PCs run the evil nasties and I ran the  Monsters, it was quite fun as I watched thier hearts stop as they thought  that their charater's might die.  It was quite an interesting time.  This  is one of the best modules that I have run into and I would encourage  anyone who wants to do something different to pick it up.	2000-05-23

This module is actually an excellent module...if you can find some way to fit it into your campaign(which I found quite dificult).  It has a good story line but it is difficult to piece together how everything works.  If  you are planning to start some Planar travel with your PCs then this is a  good module to get.  If this book was a little more understandable then it  would have been five stars.	2000-05-22

Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the beginning of a phenomenal story of the classic fight of good versus evil.  Each character is unique and interesting and the grave seriousness of the book is perfectly balanced by  the innocense of Tas, the hearty grumblings of Flint of course then there  is Fizban...but he is something all his own.  As the group struggles  through each adventure you learn to love and hate each one, and before you  know it you are done and dying to pick up the next book in the series.	2000-05-16

Salvatore is simply the best fantasy writer period and this series is a fine example of his abilities.  The talented young Cadderly and the beautiful dedicated Danica make for quite an interesting team.  This series  is a definite buy for anyone who reads Forgotten Realms (and any other  genre for that matter).  Pick it up, you will not be dissappointed.	2000-05-15

Being a new DM I found that my players were trying to take advantage of me and had to do something to stop it (I couldn't seem to kill ANY of them so I had to find another way).  Then one day I found this book and picked it  up.  My players have just found out that they are the ones who caused the  world to begin to come to an end.  Can you imagine the looks on their  faces?  This module is the most detailed I have run across in all my time  of gaming(I own something like 35 of them).  The story is the best part,  watching your noble players hearts sag as they realize they may have been  responsible for the destruction of the world is very pleasing to the eye.  If you are a DM looking for a good story to end off a high level campaign  with alot of style then you must pick this one up!	2000-05-15

These are, in my opinion the best fantasy books written.  You don't just read about the adventures  you feel as though you are a part of them.  I just couldn't put these down.  The humor that Tas, Flint and Fizban bring to the group is fantastic!  Who  can forget when the party first met Fizban with the tree.  Or Tas and  Fizban at Mount Nevermind.  This series is a classic and encourage everyone  to read it, not just fantasy lovers.  If you are a fantasy lover and you  haven't read this series--you must read it!	2000-05-12

I have recently started DMing and  have found this book to be invaluable in setting the standards for my  world.  I haven't been playing D&amp;D very long, and having the eyes of a  newcomer I can tell all out there if you wish to start DMing then you must  have this book!	2000-04-26
