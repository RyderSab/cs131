US	50387488	R1U3A3SUEF5KDX	0441008364	129756477	The Glass Harmonica	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Lighter fare from Marley	Not as thought-provoking, or as moving, as some of Marley's other works, notably \\"Terrorists of Irustan.\\" It also feels rushed and left me just a little unsatisfied. Still, it is a sweet, pleasant novel, a nice bit of light reading. <br /> <br />The story of Eilish, an Irish orphan employed by Benjamin Franklin to play his newest invention, a glass harmonica, is interspersed with that of Erin, a modern/future musical prodigy of the same instrument. As Eilish navigates her way through 18th century London, Erin struggles to engineer her own independence as well as that of her composer brother Charlie, who cannot walk thanks to an inherited neurological condition. Music is the key to both of their lives, and specifically what they call \\"glass music\\", the sound of the glass harmonica. (Essentially a mechanized device for spinning glasses, played by rubbing wet fingers around the rim - think of the sound when you rub the rim of a wine glass.)  <br /> <br />There is little real tension in this book, save for Charlie's struggles to walk and the mysterious illness (never specified, but I assume it to be lead poisoning) which plagues poor Eilish. Secondary characters are interesting, even when they're not altogether sympathetic. I was especially fond of Franklin, who comes across as the epitome of an absentminded professor.  <br /> <br />A nice bit of historical fiction, and especially fun reading if you happen to be interested in music. I guess I'm just so used to Marley's \\"issue\\" novels (\\"Irustan\\", \\"Child-Goddess\\", \\"The Maquisarde\\") that this one was just a little bit too light for me. Judged on its own, though, it's a great effort.	2005-08-25
US	50387488	R3LUOZBK2PN05C	076534341X	218899544	Probability Moon (Probability Trilogy)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A little confusing, but very entertaining	Humanity has lucked out and discovered a series of space \\"tunnels\\" left by an earlier, more advanced civilization, allowing us to jump right into interstellar travel and exploration without going through all the tedious process of solving our problems here on Earth first. The result is a space program that is highly advanced, far reaching, and not all that concerned with ethics. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, despite our shortcomings, we are still the second-most advanced civilization in the known galaxy, and we're at war with the other one. So when an unknown artifact that might have been created by the same aliens that gave us the space tunnels is found orbiting a nondescript, inhabited planet, humans immediately jump at the opportunity to gain what they hope will be a weapon to use in the war against the Fallers. As a cover to their expedition to study the artifact, a team of scientists is dispatched to the planet, known only as World. The expedition is ostensibly to study a unique society among the Worlders, shaped by what is known as \\"shared reality\\" - every Worlder must agree on everything, or they suffer blinding headaches.  <br />  <br />What is shared reality? What causes it? Are humans \\"real\\"? Are the Worlders - peaceful, agreeable, homogenous, and thus backward and unambitious - better than humans? Just what is the artifact, which the Worlders have always assumed to be a moon? These are some of the questions Kress poses, and on the whole she does a good job answering them. I would have liked more focus spent on just how shared reality shapes Worlder society, but Kress does address this much better in Book 2, so I can't really complain. 90% of the science was completely lost on me - I could still follow what was going on, but considering that the title of the book references the probability physics that Kress spends a lot of time setting up, I wish I had a better grasp on just what the heck that means.  <br />  <br />Kress does a great job with her characters; they are each well defined and characterized. (I hate it when you're 2/3 of the way through a book and can't remember whether Smith was the gruff biologist or the spunky physicist.) Her aliens are just foreign enough, while remaining sympathetic. Very different from her \\"Beggars\\" series, although very similar to a much earlier book of hers, \\"An Alien Light.\\" A fun read.	2005-08-12

For all those who read the story of David and Bathsheba with a little bit of squeamishness (he peeping Toms her, gets her pregnant, then arranges to have her husband killed in battle so he can marry her and keep her son Solomon), the yuck factor is justified here.  <br /> <br />True, it's hard to imagine David being quite the bastard he's portrayed as. With literally no redeeming qualities, you have to be able to accept that he really wasn't chosen by God, in which case the entire lineage of the House of David becomes worthless. If you're not prepared to hear some nasty things about a Biblical hero, don't bother. On the other hand, if you like hearing \\"the other side of the story,\\" you'll be gratified here. Michal is a great narrator, casting a cold eye on her husband's ambitions. With nothing to lose (David has taken her against her will, and made her a reluctant queen) she never hesitates to do what she thinks is right. A great Biblical heroine given voice, along the lines of Dinah in \\"The Red Tent.\\"	2005-08-12
US	50387488	R1W70HTDW0ZJF0	0446611956	874612816	Zulu Heart: A Novel of Slavery and Freedom in an Alternate America	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Still original and ambitious, but drier than "Lion's Blood"	In this sequel to the breathtakingly original \\"Lion's Blood,\\" Steven Barnes returns to his alternate America, now an African colony named Bilalistan. He also brings us back to his two main characters: Kai, a mystic Sufi and younger son who has now inherited the noble title of Wakil, and Aidan, his former Irish slave who now ekes out a frontier existence as a freedman.     Supposedly, the heart of this book is Aidan's attempt to find and reunite with his long-lost sister Nessa, who was sold away from him when they were first captured as slaves. In reality, however, Aidan's search is merely a subplot, a result of Kai's political schemes rather than a driving force. This bummed me out a little, because instead of character-driven plot, angst and heroism and pointless self-sacrifice and all, we get... Politics. Oh, they're interesting politics, but I just wasn't as interested in a possible war between Egypt and Abyssinia and the secession of southern New Djibouti from the rest of Bilalistan as I would have been in the personal lives of Aidan and Kai. (Barnes seems to be invoking both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars here; New Djibouti wants its independence both from its mother country and from the industrialized north.)     Anyway, as part of all this double-dealing and war mongering (and it's pretty confusing; it might take a second reading for me to really understand where all the lines are drawn) Kai decides he absolutely must get his hand on some sort of code-breaking device. To do that, he asks Aidan to re-enter slavery as a sort of gladiator, with the hope that he can then infiltrate the home of the governor and steal the device. To entice him, Kai suggests to Aidan that he could free his sister, who is the paramour of an influential general, at the same time.     A huge part of the book, as I said, is taken up with politics. Another large chunk deals with Aidan's gladiatorial training, which incorporates some of the Sufi techniques that Kai learned back in \\"Lion's Blood.\\" What we don't see in this book are characters. There's a few interesting ones, particularly some of the female characters Barnes introduces this time around. Yet the familiar triad from the last book - Kai, Aidan, and Aidan's wife Sophia - is conspicuously watered down. I just didn't care about these characters anymore, and that was disappointing.     All in all, I didn't enjoy \\"Zulu Heart\\" as much as I did \\"Lion's Blood\\". It is, however, still one of the more ambitious and original alternate histories I've ever read, and I am anxious to continue with the series. Again, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American and/or African history.	2005-08-11

She obviously has an excellent grasp of socio-political history and trends, which she uses to build a convincing and complete future society. <br /> <br />The book starts in the near future, 2008. Genetically modifying children is commonplace, and for rich entrepreneur Roger Camden, his daughter will get the best of what's available - including a new, experimental genemod for Sleeplessness. Leisha Camden, like the 19 others before her and the thousands after, is extraordinarily intelligent, cheerful, talented, and for all intents and purposes, immortal. Her unmodified twin sister, Alice, is a Sleeper, and the rift between them mirrors society's distrust, envy, and eventual hatred of the Sleepless.  <br /> <br />To escape this hatred, another Sleepless, Jennifer Sharifi, creates Sanctuary, an orbital community of Sleepless. Separate from Earth, but still tied to it, Jennifer's obsession with Sleepless superiority and their liberation from the Sleeper \\"beggars\\" goads her into progressively more radical actions. Only Leisha resists her, remaining on Earth with her mixed Sleeper and Sleepless family. <br /> <br />Sprinkled with the perfect mix of science, history, economics, and politics, with an original and thought-provoking storyline.	2005-07-11

For this reason, I think \\"Irustan\\" - which deals with Islam, women's rights, terrorism, and self-defense vs. pre-emptive action, among other things - has gained in depth and meaning since its original writing.  <br /> <br />On the planet of Irustan, Muslim fundamentalists who follow the \\"Second Prophet\\" have created a society that's just to the right of the Taliban. One of the peculiarities of Irustani society is the focus on the mind and soul to the exclusion of the body, which means that medicine - with its fixation of disease and imperfection - is seen as a practice fit only for women. Zahra ibSada is a medicant who has had  it up to here with patching up abused women and children and sending them back to the husbands and fathers who own them, so when a friend comes to her in desperation because her young daughter is about to be given to a man who has already killed two wives, Zahra steels herself to do the unthinkable. <br /> <br />At first, Zahra tries to limit her actions to self-defense, acting only to save the lives of her friends and their children. Soon, however, she realizes that simply reacting will not be enough. She must seek to outright change her society if the abuse is to stop, and that's when she moves into the tricky realm of terrorism. She starts choosing victims carefully, hoping to send a message, knowing all the while that each step could be her last. <br /> <br />Putting such a human face on terrorism is a bold move, and forces us to question the one-dimensional portrayal we usually accept. When you're absolutely powerless, when you live your life in virtual slavery, the \\"property\\" of another human being, what other choice do you have? Is it terrorism for a slave to harm her owner? To harm another slave's owner? How does a slave change the institution of slavery? What happens when terrorism is not only the only answer, but the right one? <br /> <br />As always, I am supremely impressed by Marley's abilities to craft complex, nuanced characters and to make us genuinely care for them. Her vision of Irustan makes it easy to understand the mixed feelings of so many characters; an alien world that is beautiful and harsh, traditional and unforgiving. This book is highly recommended reading for anyone who refuses to accept sound-bite explanations of the current situation in the Middle East or simplistic answers to the most difficult dilemmas facing us today.	2005-07-11
US	50387488	R45L0B0UQPPU3	0441006434	11987625	The Golden Globe (Eight Worlds)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A slightly different take on trademark Varley	At first read, I didn't like this book as much as I did \\"Steel Beach\\". I'm not sure why, but I suspect it was Varley's decision to have this book entirely narrated by a male character. I've become so impressed by Varley's heroines, including Hildy Johnson, the narrator of \\"Steel Beach,\\" that I guess I just started expecting them. Ken Valentine, aka Sparky, just wasn't doing it for me. <br /> <br />On second- and third-reads, however, darned if the little bugger didn't start to grow on me. Sparky's an actor, who really does see life as a stage and himself merely a player. He's a damn good player, but still. When we first meet him, Ken/Sparky is hiding out in the far reaches of the solar system, doing third-rate community theater and running cons. Almost simultaneously, he learns his oldest, dearest friend - and the best director in the system - is staging \\"King Lear\\" back on Luna; that the long arm of the law is onto him; and that the Charonese Mafia, a race of super-devoted assassins, has put out a hit on him. Seems like a good time to hit the road, and Sparky does, starting him on a long journey back towards Luna.  <br /> <br />Along the way, we learn in flashbacks about Sparky's history as a child star, his abusive actor father, who seems eerily invested in living his life through his son, and the events which sent him into exile. We pass through several other worlds, such as Pluto, Oberon II (which bears some resemblance to Gaia from Varley's \\"Titan\\" series), and, of course, Luna. It's on Luna that Sparky runs into Hildy Johnson, and a post-Glitch Luna CC, picking up where \\"Steel Beach\\" left off. <br /> <br />\\"Golden Globe\\" is more personal than \\"Steel Beach\\", more focused on the particular life of the narrator rather than the general society of the Eight Worlds. There's still plenty of Varley's fantastic imagination on display, however, and tons of his trademark humor and cynicism. The more I read this book, the better I like it!	2005-06-27
US	50387488	RMR2ZLBLVT9SG	0142001430	43461769	Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Not as depressing as it sounds, honest!	Everyone I ran into while reading this book had the same comment: \\"A novel about the plague? How depressing!\\" To which I had to assure them, \\"No, really! It's very inspiring and touching!\\"  <br /> <br />The book is basically about how extraordinary situations bring out the best - and worst - in people. It's less about what the plague does to the victims than what it does to the survivors, who now must take up the burdens of the fallen 2/3 of their small village. No one in Eyams was left unaffected by what occurred in 1666. Parents lost children, husbands lost wives, servants lost their jobs and their homes.  <br /> <br />Anna Frith, the narrator of the story, is uniquely poised among the village's occupants. For one thing, the tailor whose shipment of cloth ends up being the plague carrier was her boarder, making her house ground zero. She comes from a lower class family, yet works as a housekeeper and servant in the homes of the pastor, Michael Mompellion, and the richest family in the town, the Bradfords. As such, she offers us a cross section view of the plague year that is gratifyingly comprehensive - she knows everyone, from the mineworkers' children to the wife of the pastor, and can comment on all their plights. <br /> <br />The ending comes a little bit out of left field, and doesn't quite ring true. There are a few stories and characters I wished Brooks had spent more time with - at times the book felt a little rushed. The central characters of the novel - Anna, Pastor Mompellion, and his wife, Elinor - form a triad of flawed heroes. The confession of the dark secrets of both Michael and Elinor to Anna works well in one case, and not so much in the other. The pastor had it in him to be a truly great tragic figure - it is he who orders the quarantine of the town, condemning most of the townspeople themselves but probably saving countless other lives. It's this conflict, rather than the anticlimactic marital secret Brooks reveals in the final chapters, that makes for the most interesting portrayal of Mompellion, and it's this I wish she had explored further. Elinor comes and goes - at times a complex and fascinating character, at others just a smiling, meek wife and helpmeet. Oh, well. You'll find yourself loving (almost) all these characters, despite their flaws, and truly mourning those who don't make it. I would highly recommend this novel of \\"annus mirabilis\\".   <br />	2005-06-22

Some of these stories are almost horror, and (almost) all of them are shot through with regret, grief, remorse, anger, or fear. Yet all in all, I enjoyed this collection much more than I did \\"Impossible Things.\\" For one, it's more consistent in tone. Sure, that tone is dark as hell, but at least you're not being plunged into despair after just reading an absurdist comedy. The stories feel much less dated, and are more sci-fi oriented. <br /> <br />The title story is set in the same universe as Willis' popular \\"Doomsday Book\\", which I haven't read yet. It's a great advertisement for that book, raising questions about the nature of history that this history major couldn't resist. Others, like \\"Daisy, in the Sun\\" or \\"Father of the Bride\\", seem more sketches than fully fleshed-out stories, but at least they're interesting sketches. You just wish she had spent a little more time with them. \\"Sidon in the Mirror\\" and \\"All My Darling Daughters\\" are so dark they're practically horror stories, despite their sci-fi settings (a burned-out star mine and an L5 orbital college, respectively). These sent delicious chills down my back, and were my favorite out of the whole collection, sticking in my memory long after I was finished.  <br /> <br />\\"Fire Watch\\" restored my faith in Willis, and made me once again eager to seek out more of her full-length novels. Readers turned off by \\"Impossible Things\\" should give this collection a shot, as it displays Willis' considerable talent much more favorably.	2005-06-20

These stories are beautifully, hauntingly written, snapshots that will stay with you long after you've finished reading them. They are brief stories of love and loss, desire and despair, that manage to engage you intimately in the space of a few pages. <br /> <br />My favorite by far was \\"Fugue\\", the story of a father obsessed with learning to build and play the organ. I was hooked from the opening lines: \\"Some fathers on Saturday afternoons fix the car or spray weedkiller on the lawn. Mine would take the air apart and put it back together with a fugue.\\" In the next paragraph, she says, \\"On summer evenings his organ music got stuck in the screen door and floated on top of the cat's water dish.\\" I love it! I'll never hear music again without this image in my head. Hagenston has managed to make the organ music itself a physical presence in this story, almost another character.   <br /> <br />\\"Fugue\\" is also the most hopeful of the stories, most of which focus on characters in crisis - a woman whose husband has just left her, a preacher's wife unsure of her new position, a divorced father adrift in the world with only a gram of meteorite to show for his life. \\"A Gram of Mars\\" is a wonderfully written collection of short stories. I look forward to reading more from this author.  <br />	2005-06-17

This is the first book I've read by Louise Marley, and I'm anxious to seek out her other works.  <br /> <br />\\"Child Goddess\\" centers around the relationship that grows between Isabel, a priest in the female Order of Mary Magdalene, and the offworlder child Oa, who is kidnapped from her home planet and brought back to Earth. The descendent of African colonists, Oa and the other children of Virimund are unique and very, very valuable - they do not age past childhood. Oa's abduction is, of course, prompted by the greed of those who see her as the source of a Fountain of Youth, and Isabel must fight to protect her young charge from the exploitation of those who see her as a \\"creature\\" and not a human child. <br /> <br />Oa is a delight, an \\"old child\\" whom Marley has actually managed to make believable as a little girl - an incredibly difficult task, to judge by the number of authors who can't seem to manage it. What is to everyone else a wonderful gift is, to Oa, a source of shame, and her attempts to hide her \\"secret\\" from Isabel are heartbreaking. Isabel herself is a richly drawn, complex character - a devoted priest who is still not recognized by conservative Catholics, a celibate doing penance for an affair with a married doctor, a Mother who finds herself fiercely loving an eternal child.  <br /> <br />This sci-fi book has more heart than anything I've read in a long, long time. Enchanting, touching, bold, and richly told - I loved every page.	2005-06-15

The people of Blue Isle, the next on the list of places to add to the Fey Empire, are peaceful, religious, and have never even encountered magic. The Fey expect to grind the Isle into the ground in a day. Instead, through luck or coincidence, the Islanders discover that the holy water used in their religious rituals kills Fey on contact, in a particularly gruesome fashion. The battle shifts, and the Fey end up fleeing, going into hiding in an invisible fort in the middle of the Island.  <br /> <br />What follows are years of skirmishes between the Islanders and the Fey, who are led by the son and granddaughter of their Black King, Rugar and Jewel. The Islanders' king, Alexander, is forced to change his entire political outlook from a peacetime footing to winning a war, while his son, Prince Nicholas, finds out that war isn't as glorious as he thought. Meanwhile, the religious leaders responsible for making the holy water that is now used as a weapon have to reconcile their peaceful religion with the horrific things their water does to the Fey.  <br /> <br />This is one of those books where no one comes through unscathed, and sometimes the characters you like the best are the bad guys. The writing leaves something to be desired sometimes, and Rusch has a tendency to repeat herself in an effort to pound certain concepts in, but overall, an enjoyable book with an ending that makes you anxious to hear more. <br /> <br />(Important Note: While books 1,2,3, and 5 are still available, book 4, The Resistance, is out of print and generally unavailable. I read the series without it and was able to follow it fairly well, but if you're the type who absolutely cannot read a series out of order, don't even start The Fey.) <br />	2005-06-15

(Now, of course, she's added two more books to the series, with hints of more to come.) Here, humans and angels live side by side, striving to meet the ultimate goal of the Samarian religion - harmony. (With good motivation - if the mysterious god Jovah ever decides that they are not living in harmony, he'll blast the planet apart.) Music is a way of life, and none are better at it than the ruling class, the angels.  <br /> <br />Much of the story is a romance between the soon-to-be Archangel Gabriel and the bride Jovah has chosen for him, the former slave Rachel. Also in play is a plot by the old Archangel, Raphael, to remain in power, which threatens to bring about Jovah's wrath. <br /> <br />Shinn does a great job explaining the basics of Samarian life and religion, without confusing or lecturing - a tough line to walk. Her characters are likable while remaining human (or not), and her descriptions of the annual Gloria gathering (where once a year representatives from across Samaria gather to sing a ritual mass) invoke beauty and suspense, as Raphael makes his move at this holiest of ceremonies. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-06-13

Here's my assessment: It's a mess. <br />B: It doth displease me that thou hath dismissed this tome so curtly. <br />AF: Suck it up, Big Blue. I stick by my opinion. This book is literally a mess, cluttered with extraneous subplots, nonsensical plot twists, deus ex machinas, and irrelevant characters. Including you, buddy. <br />B: Be nice. <br />AF: No, I don't think I will. See, I LOVED the Elenium, the first trilogy in this series. I was so excited when the second trilogy, the Tamuli, came out. And then what does Eddings do? He proceeds to spend the next three books systematically undermining, negating, or otherwise rewriting the events of the Elenium  <br />B: Yet doth not the plot, which doth pit the very forces of good against the wicked and foul forces of evil, somewhat redeem this over-complicated tale? <br />AF: Don't I wish. There's no real suspense! It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that Sparhawk and his friends will win this battle, and not only do we know it, but they all know it too. It's very, very boring to read about people saving the world when they're not even worried about it. And part of the reason they're not worried about it is that Eddings is frantically rewriting the rules in their favor at every turn. There's almost no struggle that's not solved by someone - or something - producing some mysterious new power or ability. Let's see, Xanetia glows, kills people with a touch, and reads minds. Hey, why not give her invisibility and the ability to turn into mist and float through windows, too? Why? *Because we can!* It reaches the point where you almost start to feel sorry for the bad guys. Come on, couldn't we at least give them *one* cool power that doesn't have a counter-spell or a solution Khalad can figure out in his sleep?  <br />B: Thy simple speech and uncouth manner disturbeth me. <br />AF: Hey, let's not even get into how annoying all those `thees' and `thous' of yours are!

Stop being cutesy! Stop the God puns! We get it, OK? It's not funny anymore! <br />[Aphrael vanishes in a huff.] <br />B: Ahem. It seemeth to me that a more deliberate examination of yon plot would serve better than this continued stylistic quibbling. <br />AF: Oh, you want to know about the plot? Fair enough - but which one? Here's Sparhawk desperately trying to save the kidnapped Ehlana - no, wait, he's plotting strategy with the Atans - no, hang on, he's talking philosophy with Bhelliom - wait, now he's battling other-worldly monster soldiers summoned by Bhelliom's archrival, Klael. You didn't know about Klael? Silly, of course Bhelliom has an opposite! Didn't you read the Mallorean?  <br />B: Well, really!  <br />AF: Oh, stop it, we all know you're just a prettier Orb of Aldur, enough with the vain protests.  <br />B: Then it is thy contention then that Eddings hath, as they say, jumped the shark with this volume? <br />AF: You could say that.

Occasionally he has trouble deciding which hat he's wearing - a long list of biological examples, for instance, without any explanation of what they mean; on the other hand there's quite a few tortured metaphors and an excess of anthropomorphism.  <br /> <br />The book is roughly divided into two parts. The first is, Why sex? Ridley examines sexual reproduction from an evolutionary perspective to figure out just how requiring two genders to reproduce could have been advantageous to our prehistoric ancestors. It's not as silly as it sounds - as Ridley points out, there's many species that don't reproduce sexually, and theoretically they should have been able to outbreed those where only 1/2 the population could actually bear offspring. Sex must confer some advantage, and Ridley explores several theories as to what it could have been. He has no hesitation about playing favorites, and if anything his condescension towards some schools of thought and his endorsement of others spoiled this section somewhat. It's also very, very heavy with examples, many of them redundant and others so obscure you wonder if Ridley's just showing off his background.  <br /> <br />In the second part, Ridley looks at how sex has shaped us - by us, I mean sexual species in general and humans in particular.  He looks at sexual selection - the peacock's tail, for instance - and compares it to the male preference for female beauty and the female preference for male wealth. He examines the age-old question of monogamy vs. polygamy to figure out just what humans are, by \\"nature\\", predisposed to. He even looks at how sex might have played a role in that most human of traits, intelligence.  <br /> <br />This book is a great primer into evolutionary psychology and biology in general. Unlike some of his other books, I don't think you really needtoo much of a background in biology to follow him. Some of his examples will make you chuckle, some will have you scratching your head, and many will make you think. The text is dense but not incomprehensible; Ridley is one of the best I've ever read at writing for the layman without writing down to them. If you've ever wondered why the sexes act the way they do, this is the book for you.  <br />	2005-06-07

The action in this book takes place much earlier than most of his \\"Eight Worlds\\" short stories, right at the Bicentennial celebration of mankind's eviction from Earth. <br /> <br />Denied their own home planet, Varley's humans have nevertheless carved themselves out a few nice spots in the solar system. They've managed to create a society totally dependent upon machines and artificial intelligence for their survival - the \\"steel beach\\" of the title, where man must struggle to evolve to his new environment.  <br /> <br />Varley addresses a wide range of topics here, everything from suicide and depression to journalism, animal rights, child abuse, and the Second Amendment. Sound awfully didactic? Then you haven't been treated to Varley's prose yet, a delightful mix of cynicism, insight, imagination, and humor. His narrator, a tabloid journalist named Hildebrandt/Hildegarde Johnson (he undergoes a routine sex change partway through the story) walks us through Varley's world conversationally, as though you're an old friend.  <br /> <br />I'm always impressed by how well Varley writes women (particularly Cirocco and Gaby from his \\"Titan\\" series). Hildy Johnson is another great female character, a tough cookie with a heart of... Well, gild at least. Secondary characters are great, too, although you end the book feeling that there were a lot of stories left untold. I wanted to know so much more about Callie, Walter, Liz, and the Heinleiners! I can only hope Varley returns to Luna soon.  <br />	2005-06-07
US	50387488	R2Y2FQ9AQL42C9	0312870469	750801430	Sinner: The Wayfarer Redemption	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Oh, thank god, she's back!	That was my thought about 100 pages into \\"Sinner\\", the latest in Douglass' Wayfarer Redemption series. After the revulsion I felt for \\"Hades' Daughter\\" (easily one of the worst, and most offensive, fantasies I've ever read) and the abandoned struggle to get through the interminably tedious \\"Nameless Day\\", I was starting to think I'd have to just pretend Douglass fell off the face of the Earth after \\"Starman\\". Thankfully, the current series will indeed extend out to six books, so there are still two more Douglass books I feel pretty confident that I can look forward to. <br /> <br />Now, that's not to say everything's perfect in the land of Tencendor. There are still a few dialogue howlers, and some setups so incredibly corny I rolled my eyes to avoid reading them. I am thoroughly sick and tired of the Icarii and by now rabidly curious about the enigmatic and underused Avar, yet Douglass continues to breathlessly worship the self-absorbed and tiresome winged Icarii and squirms away from having any of her characters take the forest-dwelling Avar seriously at all.  <br /> <br />The one thing I have figured out about Douglass is that she seems to love writing flawed heroes. And I mean, she LOVES it, to the point where there are almost no completely likable characters in her books. Thankfully, she handles this much better in the Wayfarer Redemption series than in her horrendous other attempts (i.e., the child-rapist and wife-beater \\"protagonist\\" Brutus of \\"Hades' Daughter\\"), creating good guys with human foibles and bad guys you can't help liking. My only quibble is that at times she doesn't go far enough. WolfStar, the former mass-murdering Enchanter who has now formed an uneasy alliance with his descendents, the current rulers of Tencendor, has HUGE potential to be the kind of gleefully wicked villain you love to hate, but Douglass doesn't make nearly enough use of him. Ah, well. <br /> <br />The story picks up 40 years after \\"Starman\\", with Axis and Azhure abdicatingthe throne of the now-united Tencendor in favor of their son, Caelum, who must struggle to maintain his father's empire in the face of growing discontent among humans, who were stripped of their superior position when Tencendor was united. Meanwhile, his sister RiverStar is found murdered, and all suspicions point to Drago, her outcast and reviled twin brother punished with mortality after his infant plot to kill older brother Caelum. Drago flees with the help of their youngest sister Zenith, now possessed by the spirit of her maternal grandmother Niah, and Faraday, who makes a surprising comeback from her own forest exile. God, I love family politics. <br /> <br />There's plenty more, once Drago steps through the Star Gate and becomes a pawn in the plot of a group of Demons to find Tencendor, where something is hidden which will restore their powers and bring despair and death to the universe. You know how it goes. There are a few twists, some obviously set up for a revelation in books 5 and 6, which offer some intriguing possibilities about the history of Tencendor. I'm hooked once more, and now I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series!  <br />	2005-05-23

If, like me, you're a lazy reader, skimming dialogue and skipping long descriptive passages, you will find yourself forced to slow down and carefully digest each word. This is certainly not a bad thing, although it does make for a slower, more immersive reading experience. Very few things are spelled out for you. The Borgias are, after all, known first and foremost for being master obfuscators. Lucrezia, more passionate than her father and saner than her brother, has a penchant for being more outspoken than either, which serves her well as a narrator. But despite everything, I never knew what to make of Rodrigo Borgia, aka Pope Alexander. Come to think of it, I never knew quite what to make of a lot of characters, Lucrezia included.  <br /> <br />Faunce does go a long way towards ridding Lucrezia of her horrible reputation. Yes, she's beautiful and knows a lot about potions. But the worst of the things of which she's accused - leaving her first husband, sleeping with her brother, etc - are those which are out of her control. She's a pawn, used by her father to political advantage (nothing unusual there) and manipulated by her brother, whom she loves even as she realizes he's a complete psycho. It's unfortunate for poor Lucrezia that she's also smart enough to realize just how she's being used and manipulated, and to rebel against it as much as she's able - which is to say, just enough to get herself in trouble, not enough to actually accomplish anything. I'm sure some people will argue that Faunce's Lucrezia is too modern, too outspoken and feminist. My answer is, she wasn't alone. Look to Katherine Sforza, the \\"Virago\\", for a REALLY anachronistic medieval woman. Yes, Lucrezia is not a \\"typical\\" woman of the early Renaissance. But they weren't all sheep, and they weren't all illiterate idiots, as some people seem to assume. Lucrezia Borgia is just one example of a woman who resented her position in life -not the first, and certainly not the last. <br /> <br />There are times when this is an immensely frustrating book. It's also a very good one, as it sucks you into caring about Lucrezia even as you know, with that sinking feeling in your stomach, what's coming next. History has not dealt kindly with the Borgias, in many cases with good reason. Faunce's book just asks us to consider an alternate viewpoint in their story, and consider the infamous characters of history as real people.  <br />	2005-05-20
US	50387488	R23LHCORVMATTP	0312423810	689175313	The Confessions of Max Tivoli: A Novel	Books	4	15	15	N	N	Unlikable characters but fascinating story	Max Tivoli's father proudly declares him a \\"gnome\\" at his birth, and throughout the course of his backwards life Max will constantly question his \\"monstrous\\" blood. Indeed, his unique disability forces upon him choice after choice in which he must wound others if he is to experience any happiness of his own. It both ruins his relationship with Alice, his obsession and the love of his life, and offers him the bittersweet opportunity for another chance with her when she no longer recognizes the man who youthens, rather than ages. Max's relationships with Alice divide the book into thirds: first, he is her elderly-seeming landlord, then for a few short years he is her contemporary, and finally, as the book is told in flashback, Max returns to his old love in the guise of a child. <br /> <br />There's something depressing about a book in which you simply cannot bring yourself to love any of the main characters. With a single exception, the characters in \\"Max Tivoli\\" are selfish and self-centered, occasionally cruel and often insensitive, and delving into pathetic every time they reach for sympathy. <br /> <br />The exception is Hughie, who befriends Max when he is a child of six and looks like an old man, and stays with him his entire life until he is an old man in the body of a child. Hughie is almost the only person outside Max's family to know the truth, and his steadfast loyalty and unquestioning friendship were more heartwarming than anything else in this book. Forget the love story between Max and Alice - the truest love here is between Max and Hughie.  <br /> <br />The first part of the book is richly steeped in the atmosphere of late nineteenth century San Francisco. It's full of lush detail and is firmly rooted in a sense of time and place; critical when you're dealing with a story such as this one, where time is of such vital importance. And yet, by the second third of the book, we start to drift apart from the setting, losing the essence of the era just as Max himself is starting to recognize what time is going to mean for him. Was this deliberate? Maybe. I can see the author transitioning, allowing Max's own life to become the yardstick by which we measure the passage of time, rather than the events of the outside world. But if so, it's a decision I don't agree with.  <br /> <br />That's a minor quibble, though, and a question of style. And even the most unlikable characters are beautifully drawn, complex and all too human. Max's unusual lifespan is the frame upon which the story is built, and it's an original and interesting one, supporting the book without overwhelming it. I could go on and on about the parts that bugged me, but when I set the book down, my overall impression was Wow, that was a great book. In the end, that's all that matters.	2005-05-16

It is, in fact, a history of science, a book not just about what we know but about how we know it. How do we know how far away the stars are? How do we know what the climate was like at the time of the dinosaurs? How do we know what atoms look like? Bryson introduces us to the brilliant, eccentric, and just plain weird minds that find the answers to the questions that we ask about our world.  Einstein is here, and Darwin, but so are many scientists and explorers you might have never heard of.  <br /> <br />Yes, there are a few problems.  This is, after all, a *short* history of *nearly* everything, so no one should be surprised that Bryson often fails to go into a detailed analysis.  I do agree that he shows a frustrating tendency to trail off just as the reader is starting to get enthralled with the subject. \\"So we're just starting to make some really fascinating finds, very important stuff... But it's all rather complicated and I'm fresh out of metaphors\\" is the unfortunate conclusion to a lot of chapters. This is an overview, a combined physics-astronomy-earth science-biology course that gives you a broad outline of what scientists used to think, what they think now, and why. What would make this book an even better resource would be a \\"recommended reading\\" list for each chapter, so a reader interested in a particular theory could go into more depth. <br /> <br />But you simply can't beat Bryson for sheer readability. I chuckled at least once a page at his characteristic dry humor. Bryson has a gift for making the obscure interesting and difficult subjects understandable.  Yes, sometimes he does it in ways that I'm sure make actual scientists recoil in horror. But I've read books by scientists that would make English teachers climb walls, so it's only fair. If you're interested at all in science, if you're a bit of a dabbler, or if you'd just like to read an entertaining book about a serious subject, \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is for you.  <br />	2005-05-10
US	50387488	R1UI7EYT5NVWDN	0743454529	354573823	My Sister's Keeper: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Engrossing, engaging, and thought provoking	What an amazing book. This is one of those books where you resent anything that pulls you away from reading it - you know, things like friends, family, the outside world.  I finished it in a single day and immediately wanted more! I'm anxious to see if Picoult's other books are equally engrossing. <br /> <br />Normally, books in which the narration switches between characters annoy me. First-person is tough to pull off to begin with, and when you start jumping around between different viewpoints it takes a deft hand to keep the transitions from jarring you out of the story. Fortunately, Picoult has that hand. Her voices, from thirteen-year-old protagonist Anna to her delinquent older brother Jesse, to both of their parents, to Anna's cynical lawyer Campbell, are all authentic, sympathetic, and *real*. By sympathetic, I don't mean that we necessarily come to sympathize with each character - in a book like this, it's impossible. But we at least come to understand the differing motivations and priorities that drive each character, so that their actions - whether we agree with them or not - are natural and justifiable.  <br /> <br />Case in point, Anna and Kate's mother, Sara. Sara is, IMHO, a monster. The woman should never have had children, and she should CERTAINLY not have had Anna, whom she uses, exploits, and ignores shamelessly while showering her older daughter, Kate, with love and attention. But in Sara's mind, her obvious favoritism becomes perfectly justifiable - and because of that, while we may want to hold her down and tie her tubes (if not outright strangle her) we at least understand why she does and says the things she does. It doesn't excuse her, but it keeps her from becoming a caricature, an easily identifiable villain.  <br /> <br />This complexity is what I so enjoyed about \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", because it is such a rarity these days to find books that don't use shortcuts and stock characters to tell the story. Speaking of, the main story itself isinteresting and provocative, but a subplot involving a romance between Anna's lawyer and her court-appointed guardian disappoints, being rather forced and overly melodramatic, and not as tied to the main plot as it should be. And the ending! I won't give it away, but after several hundred pages of clinging desperately to the story, the final chapter will make you want to fling the book across the room. There's no excuse for such a cop-out in the final 10% of a book when the first nine-tenths has been so marvelous. <br /> <br />However, Picoult does a great job giving us an ethical quandary to ponder without preaching at us. Apart from a few questionable storytelling tactics, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" for its amazing characters and its thought provoking plot.  <br />	2005-05-09
US	50387488	R2I82JCRAWE6RG	0553564366	165021414	Impossible Things	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Eh... Not as good as I know Willis can be	After reading \\"Passage,\\" I was anxious to devour more of Willis. \\"Impossible Things\\", a collection of short stories, sounded like a perfect way to get a quick fix - a buffet table to expose myself on as many different aspects of Willis as possible. <br /> <br />Next time I'm sticking with the full-length novels. Not that there's anything *bad* about the stories in \\"Impossible Things\\", it's just that there's nothing outstanding about them either. For one thing, they're long, in most cases much longer than they need to be. For another, they're somewhat dated, which is understandable given that most were written in the '80s. Yet you never get that sense in the stories of, say, John Varley.  <br /> <br />Perhaps I just had expectations that were too high. As I said, no one story was ever bad, and some were actually quite good. \\"A Winter's Tale\\" is probably my favorite, a story about Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare's wife, and what she may have known about the famous bard that continues to puzzle literary scholars today. \\"Even the Queen\\" is clever and provocative, short and snappy, as well as being timely. \\"Spice Pogrom\\" is also clever and funny, but it's much, much too long.  <br /> <br />The stories in \\"Impossible Things\\" are a somewhat confusing mix of wit and despair. Willis alternates between mocking PC sensitivity in \\"Ado\\" and a horrifying description of a young housewife's descent into madness in \\"Chance\\", with little unifying theme to tie the book together. I enjoyed the stories individually, but the collection as a whole fell somewhat short.   <br />	2005-05-02
US	50387488	R269SQLYPOM9I7	0553575317	697288180	Attila's Treasure	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Only for those seriously interested in German history!	My god, am I a sucker for angst. The right combination of tortured psyche and stoic heroism can literally make me weak in the knees. I swoon for the emotionally unavailable yet irresistible: William Wallace, Fox Mulder.... and now Hagan Gebicung.     This is just to show that no, you don't have to be a \\"man's man\\" to enjoy this book. (???) Nor should Hagan's bisexuality be at all off-putting, because I have never met a sexier one-eyed psychotic than in Stephen Grundy's \\"Attila's Treasure\\". If you've read Grundy's previous work (this book is less a sequel than a side-quel, taking place concurrently with \\"Rhinegold\\") and were somewhat annoyed by Sigifrith's idiotic charm, while being intrigued by the murderous, mysterious Hagan - well, pull up a chair, 'cause you've got 528 pages of him all to yourself.    Hagan, a Burgundian prince, is sent as a \\"frith-bonder\\" (peace hostage) to Attila the Hun. This sounds, on the surface, like some exquisite form of medieval torture, and indeed Hagan is at first miserable. Yet he quickly finds himself acclimating to the Hunnish way of life, which is both alien and familiar to the Germanic tribes. Set shortly before the fall of Rome, when a delicate balance had Europe trembling on the edge between Roman Christianity, German Paganism, and the looming influx of Eastern nomad tribes, this novel sweeps you back to an era of savagery and honor.    A few things - first, another reviewer was upset because he thought the Goths were referred to as \\"Aryans\\", which he felt was both tasteless and inaccurate. It would be, if that's what they said. But what the Goths actually were is *Arians*, a different thing entirely. Arians were those Christians who were on the losing side at the Council of Nicaea - Bishop Arius declared that Jesus was created by and separate from God. Before Arianism was declared heretical, a Gothic leader came to Rome and converted to Arian Christianity, then went back and converted his tribe. The Goths stayed Arian long after everyone else had converted to Roman Christianity. (That's why Waldhari and Hildegund refused to worship with the Goths or even consider them real Christians.) I agree that, given the similarity to \\"Aryan\\", Grundy probably should have explained this.    As for the Attila of the title, he's not *exactly* the Attila you're thinking of. Frustrated by conflicting dates that would make it impossible for the \\"historical\\" Attila to have ever met the Gebicungs, Grundy decides to make the name a title, and this Attila is presumably the predecessor of the one whose name stuck fear in the heart of Rome. Some aspects of the Attila legend are attributed to him, however, including the war god's sword. Ah well, it's just putting the fiction in historical fiction, so I'm not complaining.    Honestly, you need to be seriously interested - I mean really, really interested - in ancient Germanic and/or Hunnish culture and religion to enjoy this book. If you're not, you're liable to be confused, possibly offended, and probably bored. If you ARE interested, you're going to love this book. I actually prefer it to \\"Rhinegold\\". \\"Attila's Treasure\\" is a delicious mix of history, fantasy, religion and politics at the dawn of the Middle Ages.	2005-05-02
US	50387488	R2JO7VIZBE1UIX	0312874766	74115197	Domain	Books	1	7	14	N	N	So bad it's funny	The best thing I can say about this book is that it plunges downward from simply implausible to outright ludicrous at a positively gleeful pace. Like the chest-thumping game of nuclear chicken which occurs near the end of the book (and never has Armageddon looked so inviting), Alten's protagonists hurtle themselves, wide-eyed and gaping, through situations that devolve from bad to worse to a rock bottom nadir that's almost funny in its absurdity. <br /> <br />Also a howler is the dialogue and writing itself. At one point, I disbelievingly counted the use of the word \\"energy\\" FOUR TIMES on a single page. Waves of blue energy, beams of red energy, waterfalls of green energy... I'll say one thing for \\"Domain\\", it's extremely well lit. <br /> <br />The supposed \\"psychiatrist\\", Dominique, blithely pretends she's never heard the term \\"professional ethics\\" by falling into the arms of her paranoid schizophrenic patient within the week; within a month she's practically panting \\"Impregnate me with your magical alien-Mayan superhero-savior of mankind sperm!\\" and sticking her tongue down his throat as he glows with the aforementioned mystical blue energy and - I kid you not - argues with an alien named \\"Guardian\\" about whether or not he is descended from a Mayan god as part of an alien plot to save the world. <br /> <br />Oh wait, it gets worse. By the end, this book has almost become a parody of itself. You can easily imagine it filmed as one of those cheesy 70's B-movies featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Like those movies, read it for laughs if you must, but for the love of God, don't expect to take it seriously. <br />	2005-04-21

For psychologist Joanna Lander, that's exactly what it seems like when she undergoes a simulated near-death experience (NDE) and finds herself moving down a long tunnel towards a bright light... and stepping out onto the deck of the infamous ship.  <br /> <br />Cracking the mystery of just why the heck she finds herself there - and whether other NDE patients have had similar experiences - quickly becomes Joanna's obsession. She's caught between the skepticism of her colleague, Richard Wright, who oversees the simulated NDE project and is convinced her experiences are hallucinations with a purely chemical cause, and flaky New-Ager Maurice Mandrake, who wants to use her experience to prove the existence of the afterlife. Joanna knows her vision is neither of these. But then what is it?  <br /> <br />I was somewhat dubious picking this book up, half-expecting a Robin Cook/Dean Koontz-style \\"medical thriller\\" with two attractive protagonists battling both the big bad medical hierarchy and their own attraction to each other. Yawn. But I had read a great review on Salon.com, so I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br />Mental note - Never doubt Salon reviews again! This book is GREAT. It kept me awake night after night. Joanna and Richard race through the labyrinthine Mercy General, interviewing NDE patients and avoiding Mandrake, while Joanna slowly gains more clues as to what her NDEs may mean for patients near death. Willis is fantastic here - she never withholds information just for the sake of suspense. Nothing frustrates me more than an author teasingly dribbling out clues for 300 pages, then dumping all the revelations out in one big bang at the end. It's a cheap thrill and a way of disguising the fact that there's usually very little suspense or story - definitely not the case here. Instead, every one of Joanna's realizations lead to more questions and more clues, and we find ourselves caught up in understanding the mystery withher. A shattering development occurs 3/4 of the way through, and injects the last part of the book with a serious sense of urgency (just in time) that really brings it home.  <br /> <br />There are a few problems. Willis is overly fond of terms like \\"confabulation\\" and inserts it into dialog even where it's inappropriate for the character. Wright is obsessed with brain scans of NDE patients, and sometimes his musings are much too technical, with not enough explanation. The nitpicking of specific enzymes is unnecessary, but until you realize that his musings are irrelevant you'll spend a lot of time trying to decode them. And the ending feels just a leeeetle bit like a cop-out. <br /> <br />Overall, though, this is an engrossing novel full of endearing characters, literary references, science, faith, and philosophy. Willis is a great writer who makes you love her work and enjoy every moment you spend with it. This is the first of her books that I've read, and I am anxious to pick up the rest!  <br /> <br />	2005-04-21

The second of Sharon Shinn's post-trilogy novels of Samaria, \\"Angel Seeker\\" sounds the least promising and yet ends up being second only to \\"Archangel\\" in the entire series. In chronology, it's placed right after the first book in the series, tying up some of the loose ends and questions that \\"Archangel\\" may have left you with - namely, what about poor Obadiah? <br /> <br />Obadiah, if you remember, was the angel who had a major crush on Rachel, the human woman who ended up marrying the Archangel Gabriel. As \\"Angel Seeker\\" opens, Obadiah, nursing a broken heart, is relocated to Cedar Hills and designated the angelic envoy to the Jansai. The Jansai are thinly veiled (no pun) Arabic/Muslim counterparts, who refuse to allow their women to show their faces or walk unescorted. Naturally, Obadiah falls in love with a rebellious but still loyal to her family Jansai woman, who meets with him secretly yet refuses to leave with him for the angel hold.  <br /> <br />I found the love story between Obadiah and Rebekah the most poignant, fully realized romance in any of the five books so far published. Maybe it's just that they admit their love and get on with it; Shinn's modus operandi up until now has mostly been for the two protagonists to vehemently deny their attraction to one another until the last three pages. Obadiah and Rebekah have no such qualms, and their love scenes are bittersweet and easily familiar to anyone who's ever conducted a clandestine affair of their own. (Ahem.)  <br /> <br />As for the \\"angel seeker\\" of the title... The subplot involving Elizabeth, who thinks she wants an angel lover but - surprise! - really doesn't, just ends up bogging the rest of the book down. It could have been a good story, but Shinn just doesn't pay enough attention to it to make it anything new or exciting. I would rather have seen the two stories separated into two separate books, with sufficient attention paid to each. But that's me.  <br /> <br />Overall, I was very impressedby \\"Angel Seeker\\". It's obvious that Shinn still has a lot to say about Samaria, and I always love revisiting it. I just hope this isn't the end of her fascination with angels!   <br />	2005-04-13

As revisionist fairy tales go, this one must be at the top of the list. Giving us the \\"back story\\" of the Wicked Witch of the West (and, by extension, much of the rest of Oz), Maguire fleshes out a one-sided story and turns Elphaba, the Witch, into a tragic hero along the lines of Macbeth. <br /> <br />The only quibble I had is that Maguire occasionally seems to get the movie version of \\"Wizard of Oz\\" confused with the book. For instance, there are only 3 Adepts in \\"Wicked\\", as in the movie. The book had 4. (Other reviewers seem to have the same problem. For the record, in the book the shoes were *silver*, not ruby. They were switched in the movie to take advantage of Technicolor.) <br /> <br />Maguire's Oz is more full of politicking than even those who say the Oz books are a Populist fable about the gold standard could have imagined. Elphaba, the green-skinned daughter of a missionary and his noble-born wife, studies at the prestigious Shiz University, where she becomes involved in the fight for Animal rights. (Capital Animals are sentient animals, treated as second-class citizens in Oz and quickly on their way to losing their rights altogether.) She even becomes a terrorist for the movement for a while, until her lover is killed and she goes into shock and hiding. Meanwhile, her sister Nessarose inherits her title and starts to rule Munchkinland in the East, where her disfigurement, knowledge of sorcery, and somewhat cruel ways earn her the nasty nickname \\"Wicked Witch of the East.\\" See where this is going? How about this - Elphaba's flighty but good-hearted college roommate, Galinda, graduated with a degree in sorcery and now resides in the North. And Elphaba finds herself in the West, in the homeland of her dead lover, who was a Vinkus - a Winkie. <br /> <br />Part of the fun of this novel is seeing the way the characters align themselves to be in place when Dorothy's house flies in from Kansas and Baum's book begins. And Elphaba is one of the greatest characters I've ever read. In fact, this book is filled to the brim with great (which is not to say good) female characters. From Elphaba and Nessarose's bored mother, to the wife of Elphaba's lover, to Dorothy, a simple farm girl whose unthinking actions have more far-reaching consequences than anyone could imagine, this is a book that draws you intimately into the lives of the characters. You don't have to like them, or even sympathize with them, but Maguire does make you understand them. <br /> <br />This is an absolutely amazing read. I think to get the full impact, you should probably have read \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" first, but anyone who's seen the movie should be able to make sense of \\"Wicked\\". Regardless, this book will change the way you look at the familiar story, and maybe even prompt you to wonder what other stories we've only heard one side of.  <br />	2005-04-05

Not fiction, not an adult fairy tale. It's porn. And there's certainly not anything wrong with that, but let's not try to dress this book up and pretend it's more significant or \\"respectable\\" than it is. It's certainly not an exploration of the metaphor of Sleeping Beauty's awakening as a sexual initiation, as the jacket blurb ludicrously describes it. Nor does it offer any particular insight into the inner workings and psychology of BDSM, at least none that couldn't be found in the Usenet postings of any amateur erotica writer. <br /> <br />It's erotica. Reasonably well-written, but often monotonous and frequently more silly than sexy. Maybe that's just my taste; I've never been particularly turned on by long, protracted spanking sequences, nor by the gleeful depiction of the various humiliations visited upon Beauty. Some people are, and if that's your cup of tea you're going to love this book.  <br /> <br />For my money, if I'm going to read erotic fiction I'm going to stick with Laurell K. Hamilton, or with the sublime Jacqueline Carey. Carey's \\"Kushiel\\" series is so much better, both as fiction and as erotica, than the \\"Beauty\\" series that I feel guilty even comparing them. \\"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\\" has its moments, and the plain black cover means I don't have to hide it when the in-laws stop in for coffee. But chances are it's not going to have a prominent position on my nightstand anyway.  <br />	2005-03-17
US	50387488	RADRM7JSAUCOH	0151010668	415725015	Codex	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Don't ask me why, but I liked it	Ever read a book and really enjoy it while you're reading it, but when you're finished and you set the book down you realize you're actually kind of disappointed? That's my experience with \\"Codex\\" in a nutshell. The book is such a great, easy, fun read I almost didn't even notice that nothing happens for the first several hundred pages. And the ending is almost criminal, it's so abrupt and so unsatisfying. And yet, it's a tribute to Grossman that I just *didn't care* - I enjoyed the book anyway. <br /> <br />\\"Codex\\" explores the life of Edward Wozny, who's introduced as one of those cool, emotionally removed financial something-or-others that populate Wall Street and generally make horrendous narrators. But wait - watch Edward unravel before our eyes as he's reluctantly hired to shelve an uber-rich client's book collection, then finds himself sucked into a Duchess' search for a rare medieval manuscript. Meanwhile, his geek friend has introduced him to an addictive computer game, a Myst-like save the world by solving puzzles exercise, which gets more and more interesting the worse Edward plays it. By the time he's fully human, and inevitably gets his heart broken, the stuffed shirt from Chapter One is almost unrecognizable, and is infinitely more sympathetic. <br /> <br />The supposed parallels between the manuscript and the game are much weaker than I was expecting, and as I said the ending leaves a lot to be desired. But this book is such a great read that I would have forgiven it more sins than that. Filled with mysterious secondary characters, red herrings, plot twists, symbolism, and history, this book should make great beach reading when it comes out in paperback.  <br />	2005-03-10

Imagine my shock when I set down the book after finishing the last chapter and realized that I was actually *disappointed*. <br /> <br />This book is just too vague to be any fun. For starters, Maguire's narrative shifts from third to first person at a dizzying pace; worse, it's not even the same first person from chapter to chapter. There are no clues at the start of each chapter to tell us who we're listening to, so it generally takes two or three paragraphs to figure out who's speaking each time the narrative changes, which is horrendously frustrating and completely interrupts the book's flow.  <br /> <br />Also troubling are the questions Maguire raises and then never addresses, for instance the nature of the dwarves and their home. The dwarves are easily the most interesting characters in the book, yet whenever Maguire starts to get too close to them, he invariably shies away. Bianca herself is a complete blank slate: no personality, few memories, and zero passion. You'd think she could have shown a spark of *something* - anger, terror, even love for the man who rescues her. Instead she's as calm and placid as the deer the hunter kills in her place, and about as boring. <br /> <br />Instead of an interesting Snow White, Maguire instead gives us a wickedly diabolical yet fascinatingly sympathetic Queen instead, in the person of Lucrezia Borgia. Casting a historical figure in a central role appears to be a first for Maguire (although it could be argued that the Lucrezia Borgia he portrays is as much a fictional creation as is Bianca de Nevada; however Maguire didn't create the nasty rumors about her, he just borrowed them). It's unfortunate that he didn't go all the way and just make Lucrezia his protagonist instead. At times it seems even Maguire isn't sure whether she's wicked or just misunderstood. <br /> <br />Much as I hate to admit it, this version of Snow White falls short even of (and believe me, I never thought I'd say this) Sheri Tepper, who made it a subplot in her Sleeping Beauty retelling \\"Beauty\\". I haven't given up on Maguire yet, but I'm very disappointed that the brilliance of \\"Wicked\\" wasn't repeated here. <br />	2005-02-17

I'm starting to be disappointed in Laurell Hamilton's work. Not necessarily because she's putting so much sex into her books, but because a) it's at the expense of plot, dialogue, and character and b) it's bad sex. If this were a book filled with nothing but hot, kinky sex, I'd be just fine with that. But the sex isn't even that great! The second half is taken up with Meredith touching a bunch of guys with a magical ring that gets her off each time. Nice, but after the fifth guy in line, it gets a little old, and very unsatisfying for the rest of us. <br /> <br />The plot, if anyone cares, involves Meredith coming into some serious and mysterious new power that could restore the Unseelie Court to its former glory - if she can stay alive and keep it out of the hands of her enemies. Typically, however, she's less concerned with resurrecting Faerie than with picking out outfits and cuddling with her bodyguards. And talking. My God, do these people talk a lot. They will literally drop whatever they're doing and go on for pages at a time, about the most inconsequential detail imaginable - yet, when something really, really important happens, it barely even rates a mention. Nicca's wings burst out of his back in the middle of having sex with Meredith - and she wipes the blood off her face and hauls someone else into her bed. Focus, girl! <br /> <br />The end is left somewhat dangling - the whole book takes place over the course of a few days, so a lot of issues are raised that don't get resolved. I can hope, I guess, that they'll be addressed in the 4th book, \\"Stroke of Midnight\\", but something tells me I shouldn't hold my breath. On the other hand, Meredith adds a few more men to her queue, so at least the hot sex should be back soon.   <br />	2005-02-07
US	50387488	R3C4BIJ82U44U	0446612219	958613694	Lion's Blood: A Novel of Slavery and Freedom in an Alternate America	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A must-read alternate history of the American South	The \\"point of departure\\" in this alternate history seems to be the ascension of Alexander the Great to the throne of Egypt (rather than dying young in Babylon.) From there, he creates an African empire that comprises two major powers, Egypt and Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Later, Mohammed's daughter Fatima flees to Abyssinia and establishes it as a Muslim stronghold. From there, Africans colonize the New World, naming it Bilalistan after a follower of Mohammed. <br /> <br />Later, by the 1870s, Viking raiders are selling Irish and German slaves to the blacks who live on plantations in the south. One of these slaves is Aidan, only a boy when his father is killed and he, his mother, and his twin sister are sold into slavery. Aidan ends up on the plantation of a sympathetic and enlightened noble, the Wakil, who allows his slaves to retain some vestiges of their language, culture, and religion (a mix of Druid and Christian). The Wakil's younger son, Kai, befriends Aidan and the two grow up together, until a woman comes between them. Aidan, finally with something worth fighting for, begins to chafe at the bonds of his slavery, driving a wedge further between the two friends. <br /> <br />Will Aidan succeed in his efforts to free himself and find the rest of his family? Will Kai, who has embraced mystic Sufism, break with his own family and denounce the practice of slavery? Can there ever be true friendship between master and slave, or is one always using the other? And why is it always war that brings men in novels together? <br /> <br />This is an amazing novel, both in scope and execution. Barnes manages to create a completely believable alternate history. The comparison to our own history is heightened by both similarities and differences. Barnes is not lazy enough to simply turn the black/white divide on its head; there is a complex backstory and plenty of small details to convince you of his Bilalistan as a plausible alternative to the American South. <br /> <br />The onlyweakness? The characters. Occasionally, Kai (and to a lesser extent, Aidan) seems more motivated by plot necessity than by character. His decisions to alternately befriend, alienate, and forgive Aidan are too often made based on what Barnes needs him to do, rather than what it would actually make sense for Kai to do under the circumstances. Other secondary characters are merely sketched in; I was particularly disappointed in the one-dimensional portrayal of most of the women.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this is absolutely a must-read for any fan of the Civil War, Muslim and African history, or alternate history. One of the best alternate histories I've ever read, right up there with Kim Stanley Robinson's masterpiece \\"The Years of Rice and Salt\\" (highly recommended to anyone who enjoys this book). <br />	2005-01-13
US	50387488	R31SI22U3ZCXAJ	0812551745	308571229	Snare	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Slow beginning, but worth pushing through	What happens when three very different groups of people, who were actually trying to escape each other and live in isolation, end up marooned together on a distant planet already inhabited by a sentient species? How will they learn to live together and to protect the indigenous ChaMeech, while still preserving their unique heritage and traditions?  <br /> <br />This is the backdrop Kerr, author of the acclaimed \\"Deverry\\" series of fantasy novels, sets up for her science fiction book that takes place on the planet Snare. After a few false starts and confusing twists and turns, the majority of this novel is excellent, with great characters and an interesting plot. <br /> <br />Two major flaws: The beginning of the book, which is confusing and really fails, in my opinion, to properly introduce some of the major characters. And the end, which trails off somewhat anticlimactically and, it seems, right on the verge of some really interesting stuff we've been anticipating for the last hundred pages! I don't know if Kerr had a sequel planned, but if ever a book screamed for one, this is it. <br /> <br />However, if you can push through the first hundred pages or so, it does get MUCH better, trust me. I love books that feature characters who \\"switch sides,\\" or have underlying motivations that shape their actions in ways that aren't immediately foreseeable. Suffice it to say that both Zayn, an exiled Karshak who seems to be an assasin sent to kill the rightful Khan, and Soutan, the enigmatic sorcerer who promises to lead the Khan back to his people, are NOT what they appear. None of the characters are static; all grow and change in completely believable ways over the course of the book. Even the alien ChaMeech are revealed to be both more and less \\"human\\" than was assumed. <br /> <br />The revellation of the history of Snare and its three groups of settlers (the Muslim Karshaks, the American-Indian-like Comnees, and the technologically advanced Cantonneurs) comes a little late in the book for my taste, and as I said the ending leaves a bit to be desired. But the rest of the book was great enough that I'm dying for a sequel to tie up the loose ends! I would highly recommend this book to both devoted Kerr fans and readers of sci-fi alike.	2004-12-31
US	50387488	R2YG41XZMODPB1	0765309009	713170197	Memory	Books	2	7	12	N	N	Too much was left unexplained	This book was OK, but somehow it didn't quite live up to my expectations. For one thing, it left a LOT of things unexplained at the end. I like a little shocking revellation with my sci-fi, and there was none of it here. This is, as others have noted, a coming-of-age tale first and foremost. The fact that it takes place in an alternate world is secondary, and while Nagata seems to have created a rich and fascinating history for her world, she doesn't bother sharing most of it with us.  <br /> <br />What's left is the story of Jubilee, a young woman who has just learned that the brother she thought she lost seven years ago might still be alive. She sets out to find him, and on the way discovers that she is destined to either save or destroy the world - again. The premise of reincarnation is one that Nagata presents as matter-of-fact yet never bothers to explain, so we're left to take it on faith that Jubilee has, indeed, been there and done that before.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most interesting, and the most frustratingly enigmatic, character in the novel is the silver which rises to coat the land every night. the silver is an agent of both destruction and creation, taking away anything it touches and leaving in its place fantastic and surreal structures from eons past. Jubilee soon realizes that the balance of silver hangs on a knife-edge - too much and the world will drown in it, too little and the world will starve. Part of her destiny is to make that fateful choice. <br /> <br />But what is the silver? A biological entity? The fever dreams of an injured goddess? Illusion? We never find out, and for that I just can't forgive Nagata. She sets that question up over and over again, and it never gets answered or even addressed. Talk about leaving us hanging! <br /> <br />The writing is good, and what story is there is interesting. The characters needed some more development, and the plot tended to drag. I was torn between two and three stars, but the above issue withthe silver just pushed me over the edge. I can't see recommending it to anyone who likes action and surprises in their fiction.	2004-12-31
US	50387488	R9MN5NOJP1VUH	0446611069	265222748	Kingdom of Cages	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Lots of questions, but no easy answers	This novel starts brilliantly, with an intriguing premise, a strange world and culture, and a cast of interesting, complex, yet likable characters. It's unfortunate that it peters out at the end, with a conclusion that manages to feel both rushed and hanging. I get the feeling this might have made a better duology, an idea reinforced by the five-year \\"jump\\" that occurs in the middle of the book which, while it ultimately makes sense, is nevertheless jarring. <br /> <br />My favorite aspect of the book is the fact that it presents all sides of every situation, from every perspective.  We're first led to sympathize with the Pandoran's refusal to allow refugees to immigrate to their planet, then later to demonize them for it. Likewise, the interplanetary Authority and its representative, Beleraja Poulos, are first painted as bad guys, throwing their weight around and using force and terror to bully the Pandorans into helping them. Later, as we learn more about Beleraja and the situation she faces, we start to respect her courage. Zettel refuses to paint her characters in black and white; each has complicated motivations and conflicting values and it's quickly obvious that there's no \\"right\\" solution.  <br /> <br />Even the situation presented to the two main protagonists, young sisters Chena and Teal Trust, is fraught with \\"do the ends justify the means\\" quandaries. Told their genetic makeup is uniquely suited to creating a cure for the mysterious disease striking colonized worlds across the galaxy, they are nevertheless hesitant to allow the Pandorans access to their bodies.  Their qualms are perfectly understandable, yet also selfishly motivated. What if the Trusts could save lives through the sacrifice of their freedom (or perhaps lives)? Would it be worth it?  <br /> <br />Zettel, unfortunately, makes little attempt to answer this question. The second half of the book seems to lose focus, dissolving into a confusing jumble of double-crossing. The scenes with the city-mind of Pandora, an artificial intelligence named Aleph, are so full of promise yet so ultimately confusing and secondary to the main plot that we are left frustrated.  <br /> <br />Yet overall, this is a fascinating book with a lot of great ideas. The images of the ecology of Pandora are great, as are the descriptions of the unique culture the Pandorans have created to protect it. And Chena and Teal Trust are absolutely believable as adolescents and sisters, flawed yet likable and resourceful. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes intelligent science fiction.   <br />	2004-12-14

What an awesome book! I bought it because I love Dutch history and my fianc loves maritime history, and any book we can both enjoy is well worth the money. Enjoy it we did - even the copious and some might say exhaustive notes at the end, which take up the last 1/3 of the book. <br /> <br />My one complaint is that the narrative jumps around quite a bit, from the voyage of the Batavia, back to Holland, then to the shipwreck, then back to Holland, then to the East Indies, then back to the islands... You get the idea. Along those lines, a character list would have been enormously helpful, to keep track of the various Jacops, Jans, and Pieters as we jump back and forth in time and location.  <br /> <br />Those quibbles aside, it's no surprise to me that movie rights have already been sold. A lot of attention has been paid to Corneliszoon, the psychopathic mutineer, but there are just as many quiet heroes in this story who will move you with their bravery. From the young maid who volunteers to swim a mile back to the sinking ship to get more drinking water, to the soldier who organizes a resistance to the murderous cronies of Cornelisz, the story of the Batavia is filled with both monsters and heroes, acts of courage and acts of savagery - and all of it true. <br />	2004-12-08
US	50387488	R57UX844TJEAS	0553580078	119744907	The Years of Rice and Salt	Books	4	6	7	N	N	One of the best alternate histories I've ever read	The premise of the story is as basic as it is original: what if 99% of Europe had been wiped out in the plague, not just 30%? What would the world be like without Christianity, European imperialism, the Industrial Revolution? The answer is, both jarringly different and surprisingly similar. <br />  <br />Covering 700 years of history in a single novel could present huge headaches in terms of continuity and characterization. First, as with any alternate history novel, is the obvious: the further away you get from the point of departure, the more things will have changed. YORAS is masterful in its historical believability; events build upon each other naturally, with even the maps at the start of each chapter growing in increments as the face of the world slowly changes. Thus, in the first chapter, only one difference from actual history is apparent, while 700 years later, almost every aspect of life has been completely altered - except, of course, human nature. <br />  <br />Robinson also solves the problem of characterization across centuries by having the main characters reincarnate in each chapter. I, B, and K carry over the same personalities, under different circumstances and with different relationships, which in some ways makes them even more complex and fascinating than characters we would get to know over a single lifetime. Robinson deserves a lot of credit for this approach, and I hope other historical fiction writers start stealing this idea. <br />  <br />YORAS requires an open mind, a desire to ask complex questions about history and our role in it. I would highly recommend it to anyone with the willingness to seek answers to those questions.	2004-11-19

That's the central question at the heart of this novel, a look at the reign of Bloody Mary, Queen of England, through the sympathetic eyes of a young woman who would have every excuse in the world to hate and fear her. Hannah Green is a Spanish Jew who has fled the Inquisition with her father. Furthermore, she has the second Sight, the gift of prophecy, which could immediately condemn her as a witch even if she weren't burned for heresy. Yet Hannah is taken into the English court as a holy fool, protected first by her patron Lord Robert Dudley, then by the Queen she comes to serve and love, the Catholic Mary.<br /><br />The contradiction of Hannah's devotion to Mary is both the novel's greatest conflict and its worst sticking point. It allows us to regain sympathy for a tragic figure who has been demonized by history, overshadowed by the greatness of her younger sister Elizabeth. Yet let's face it, the condemnation is not entirely unfounded. Bloody Mary did attempt to bring the Inquisition to England, burning hundreds of Protestants in the hopes of returning England to the \\"true faith\\" (and, as this book points out, in revenge for Henry VIII's divorcing her mother Katharine of Aragon).<br /><br />Part of the problem lies with Gregory's protagonist, Hannah, who appears absolutely incapable of criticizing anyone, from the traitorous Dudley to the fanatical Mary to the manipulative Elizabeth. In loving and respecting all of them equally, Gregory perhaps thought she was making Hannah a fair and unbiased narrator. Instead, we see Hannah as a true fool indeed, blindly placing her trust and love in people who care next to nothing for her. Indeed, the best part of the book comes when Hannah flees to Calais with her new husband, where she finally grows a spine and stands up to her catty and snide in-laws.<br /><br />Nevertheless, while certain aspects of the book are weak or implausible, the overall effect is impressive. This is a vibrantly drawn historical novel, offering fresh portrayals of familiar figures and a new perspective on a dark period of England's history, featuring flawed but likable characters. I would recommend it to any fan of historical fiction.ve.

A motley crew of plucky mortals from every corner of the world gathers together to form a company on a quest to fulfill the prophecy.  I love you, Jacqueline Carey, but I wouldn't come to your defense in a copyright lawsuit. <br /> <br />Now, granted, the book does get better further in, but unfortunately that's canceled out by the below-average prologue and the depressingly average first third of the book.

Historical fiction, about a woman, written by a woman, that does not descend to bodice-ripping! (You know who you are.) This is the first novel by Penman that I have read, but it will most certainly not be the last.     The war between Stephen of England and Empress Maude (or Matilda) was a little-known precursor to the rule of the Plantagenets. Penman details their struggle for the throne and the chaos that ensues, a time of such suffering and hardship for the English people that it was said that \\"Christ and his Saints slept\\". Penman doesn't hesitate to point out that neither Stephen nor Maude was the best choice for sovereign; their antagonism comes from the fact that their flaws lie on opposite ends of the spectrum. As one character points out, Stephen would listen to anybody, Maude would listen to nobody.     While the struggle between the two cousins takes center stage, the book is populated with a range of secondary characters, both historical and fictional. Chief among the former is Maude's half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, and among the latter another half-brother, Ranulf. Indeed, if there is any romantic moonings or bodice-rippings at all in this book, they come at the expense of Ranulf. Others include Maude's jerk of a husband Geoffrey, Stephen's sweet wife with a heart of steel, their respective sons the brash Henry and cruel Eustace, and their assorted allies. Penman never lets any of her characters descend into caricature, however, allowing each to display their own set of flaws and virtues. Moreover, she takes care to point out that what in an ordinary man might be a virtue can be, in a ruler, a fatal flaw.    While slightly tedious at times, Penman's skill at creating sympathetic characters means that the reader starts to take a personal interest in the outcome of each battle. Even if you know what's coming, you can still taste Maude's defeat when she comes so close to being crowned and then it slips away.    Richly detailed, with a compelling story and likeable characters, this is a fantastic novel of medieval England.	2004-11-05

From veiled hints and glimpses of past incarnations, astute readers will have already managed to piece together a pretty good idea of how the vows of Deoris and Domaris, the two sisters from \\"Fall of Atlantis,\\" shaped the world and lineage of Avalon. Why, then, do we need to hear the specifics of how the Atlantean refugees built Stonehenge, or settled at the Tor? Short answer: We don't. Long answer: We don't, and thanks a lot for boring us with it anyway.    Then there's Paxson's writing style, which is unfortunately so inferior to MZB's that I had to go back and read \\"Fall of Atlantis\\" just to cleanse the bad taste out of my mouth. Every sentence is either ridiculously expository or hopelessly vague. And the exclamation points! So annoying! Like a ninth-grader's email! Furthermore, the story just DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I'm sorry, but Micail and Tiriki end up the equivalent of three towns over from each other, but they don't find each other for FIVE YEARS?     Speaking of the characters, most are so poorly drawn that at times I literally could not remember whether certain characters were even male or female. And far from MZB's wonderfully nuanced and conflicted portrayals of, say, Riveda or Lancelot, here all we get are cartoons. In Paxon's Avalon, anyone who was rich and privileged in Atlantis will invariably become a power-mad egomaniac bent on exploiting the British natives, while her \\"good-hearted\\" characters love their savage brethren and rail against the injustices of their countrymen. Oh no! Damisa thinks. Will I join the clearly delineated forces of evil and enslave the natives so I can keep wearing silk and drinking decent wine, or will I become a force of truth, justice, and the Atlantean way by painting myself blue and grubbing in the muck in a thinly veiled attempt at atonement for my race's arrogance? Boooring.    If you're a fan of \\"Mists of Avalon\\" I know you think you need to read this book, but honestly, you don't, and you shouldn't. Sometimes certain things are better left unsaid, and this story is one of them.	2004-10-22
US	50387488	R2MBBB2LPRLBFG	038081658X	402338041	The Fresco	Books	3	6	7	N	N	"Gibbon"-lite	\\"The Fresco\\" is obviously an attempt by Tepper to rewrite \\"Gibbons Decline and Fall\\", to make it more palatable. As if pointing out our flaws through the eyes of a group of stuck-up aliens will make us more likely to slap our foreheads and go, \\"My god, she's right!\\" Fresco has more things to smile about than Decline, but the plot is even weaker. What's frustrating is that it could be very, very good, but Tepper gets too caught up in having the aliens that visit Earth to help us join the Intergalactic Alliance (or whatever) carp and bitch and nitpick every aspect of our collective society.  <br /> <br />Basically, aliens come to Earth and pick a battered housewife from New Mexico as their spokesperson. These aliens are part of the above-mentioned Interplanetary Club, and they've come to invite us to join - assuming we can shape up our act to meet their standards, that is. They then proceed to \\"fix\\" us, without even asking whether we WANT to be part of their club.  <br /> <br />The aliens' idea of home-improvement involves things like making Jerusalem disappear until everyone can play nicely with it, giving every woman in the Arab Muslim world a case of \\"ugly disease\\" so their men can't use the excuse that they're inciting lust, and giving the police nifty little drug-sniffing gadgets so they don't have to worry about inconveniences like due process and probable cause. Now, I'm the first one to admit that the current criminal justice system sucks, but I can think of a dozen things wrong with this scenario without even trying. And why are women being punished for men's perceptions of them? Wouldn't it be more appropriate for every Arab male to become impotent? Doesn't claiming that the problem could be solved by ugly women imply that there was some validity to the old ideas that women shouldn't be allowed in public because they incite so much lust?  <br /> <br />Tepper comes up with only one clever alien-human interaction. If you're spiteful like me, you'll love the revenge she visits upon male right-to-lifers; I wish she had shown as much creativity and dark humor in the rest of the book as she does in these scenes. <br /> <br />So, do the aliens have a right to order us around? Are they really any better than us, or is \\"human nature\\" intrinsic everywhere? Unfortunately, these are questions Tepper never addresses, preferring instead to focus on what an ideal world it would be if we could only get rid of all the a-holes in it. She seems to be developing an obsession lately with \\"quick-fix\\" solutions, where either it turns out our dysfunctions aren't really our fault to begin with, or that someone can wave a magic wand and make them all go away. It's too bad, because I liked her far more insightful analyses of different hypothetical cultures in \\"The Gate to Women's Country\\" and \\"Singer From the Sea\\" much better.  <br />	2004-10-15

In this book, she gives Shakespeare a Jewish mistress, plonks him down in the middle of a murder mystery, and has him smuggling Portuguese refugees off a pirated ship - and it works.  <br /> <br />Kellerman has observed the most important rule of writing about Shakespeare: Have a sense of humor. (After all, he did.) Even when tackling serious subjects or plotting suspenseful encounters, there is an easy feel about this book that makes it enjoyable to read. <br /> <br />Rebecca Lopez is the daughter of an expatriate Portuguese converso - Jews who supposedly renounced their faith. Yet her family has fled to England, where they can practice their religion, albeit secretively. She meets Shakespeare - how else? By dressing as a man and attending one of his plays, then challenging him to a duel. Shakespeare, meanwhile, is trying to solve the murder of his friend and benefactor Harry, and finds himself drawn further and further into the seedy underbelly of Elizabethan London at the same time as he is falling in love with Rebecca and becoming involved in the plight of the Jewish exiles.  <br /> <br />Lighthearted without being farcical, poignant but not sappy, Kellerman strikes a great balance here with a wonderful novel. <br />	2004-10-15

What, no one was ever able to prove Eleanor of Aquitaine had an extramarital affair, so you just make one up? I think the reverse (which is far more historically accurate) makes a better story - how in return for power a queen would grit her teeth and do without romance or love. Instead we get an Eleanor who carries on a weepy affair with the fictional Richard Rancon (loosely based on her factual vassal Geoffrey Rancon, and renamed, it seems, entirely so that her son Richard the Lionheart can be named after him) right under the nose of her second husband, Henry II - who does nothing about it. Yeah, right.  <br />  <br />After reading Alison Weir's excellent biography \\"Eleanor of Aquitaine,\\" I was pleasantly surprised at how closely Kaufman had mirrored her novel to actual history - which makes her decision to base the backbone of the story on a made-up character for the sake of romance even more confusing. With all the men Eleanor was alleged to have slept with (including Henry's father), why would you need to make one up?  <br />  <br />Aside from that, I greatly enjoyed this book. The tales of court intrigue and European political conflict are full of all the best medieval scheming and backbiting, while never getting too bogged down in minutiae. Even if you know next to nothing about this period, you'll be able to follow Kaufman's novel and cheer for one of the greatest Queens in history. <br />	2004-09-22

It's better than it sounds	Claire Randall, a WWII nurse and (fairly) newlywed, is enjoying her second honeymoon in Scotland after the war, when she is sucked, willy-nilly, though a stone circle into 1743. Now, this has previously been the set-up for all sorts of embarrassingly bad historical romance novels - I know, I've read most of them. But Gabaldon doesn't stoop to most of the cringe-worthy stereotypes of her genre. Claire, first having been raised in a series of Third-World countries by her anthropologist uncle, and then having suffered through the war, adjusts relatively easily to the mechanics 18th century life, allowing Gabaldon to focus instead on her characters. <br /> <br />I say \\"characters\\", and there are plenty of great secondary characters, true. But to be honest, all we care about is Claire's love interest - Jamie MacKenzie Fraser, nephew of the MacKenzie clan laird that takes the lost Claire in, and exiled laird of Broch Tuarach. Jamie's in trouble with the English overlords, and Captain Jonathan Randall (ancestor of Claire's 20th-century husband Frank) in particular. Tall, red-haired, kilt-wearing, brogue-speaking, eye-twinkling - think William Wallace, with a little less angst, and is it any wonder Claire can't help herself falling in love with him, despite being married back in the 20th? <br /> <br />Once Claire accepts her situation, she finds herself under suspicion from both the Scottish and the English, each suspecting her to be a spy for the other side. The Jacobite rebellion is brewing (covered in \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\"), and tensions are high. Claire, who knows what's coming, is trying her best to get the heck out of there, but ends up getting more and more entangled in the 18th century. The book is told in first-person, and Claire is an awesome narrator, with a distinct voice and a wry sense of humor that leaps neatly over the few rough patches in the story. Feisty and opinionated without being obnoxious, Claire is a perfect time-traveling heroine - she can fit intothe 18th century when she has to, but remains a 20th century woman at heart. <br /> <br />Don't, don't, don't write this book off just because it's a time-traveling romance novel! I know, you'd think the genre had been driven into the ground, but I swear this book picks it up, dusts it off, and polishes it until it sparkles. The writing is among the best I've read in ANY genre, the research is impeccable, and the characters so real you'll be dying to read more about them. Thank goodness there are plenty of sequels! <br />	2004-09-22
US	50387488	RDIBJF0DM2X0B	0312187459	237942375	The Memoirs of Cleopatra: A Novel	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	Exhausting but fascinating	As I remarked several times in the time it took to read Memoirs of Cleopatra, \\"I'm really enjoying the book, but lugging it around is starting to be a bitch.\\" At well over 900 pages, this is a much longer novelized biography than, say, Colin Falconer's \\"When We Were Gods,\\" so if you're not really, reeeeaaalllyy interested in Cleopatra, Caesar, and Antony, you might want to skip this one. <br /> <br />If you are interested, however, I don't see how you could do much better than this book. From the death of her mother as a young child to her own death 30 years later, \\"Memoirs\\" recounts Cleopatra's struggles to hold onto the crown of an independent Egypt. These struggles pit her against everyone from her own siblings to the might of the Roman Empire, which she carries on a tortured love/hate relationship with in the form of her affairs with Caesar and Antony and her mutual hatred with Augustus Caesar (Octavian). Cleopatra, through her son by Caesar, has a claim on Rome, yet she wants nothing more than to free the Eastern world from its influence. This conflict provides much of the plot of the second half of the book, culminating in Cleopatra and Antony's disastrous defeat at Actium and their subsequent double suicide.  <br /> <br />The book is filled with captivating secondary characters, most of them historical: Cleopatra's four children, her physician, her servants, various political figures in Rome, King Herod of Judea. It's these characters that give the book its life apart from the well-known story of Cleopatra, and I was impressed by the care George has shown in not allowing her story to become sensational or pitiful.  <br /> <br />Honestly, as heavy as the book was, I thought it was worth every page.	2004-09-14

I'm glad I did, as this is one of those books that can be appreciated on several different levels. At 11, I was more interested in the descriptions of the fairy-tale aliens, while reading it now, I can appreciate the dynamics between all the characters, the science behind the fiction, and a terrific first-contact story. <br /> <br />A small space exploration stumbles across a fantastic satellite orbiting Saturn. A massive, hollow wheel, 1300 kilometers across, it sucks them inside an incredible, artificial alien world. Captain Cirocco Jones reunites her crew after their crash landing, and they begin to travel around the inside of the wheel - which they name Gaea -  in search of a way home. They meet the citizens of Gaea, who are familiar and yet utterly alien. (They include winged humanoids and centaurs.)  <br /> <br />Eventually, Cirocco and her friend Gaby make the grueling 600 Km vertical journey up one of the spokes of the wheel to the hub, where they meet the God of Gaea and learn some very interesting things about this alien \\"planet\\".  <br /> <br />John Varley has done his science homework, which allows you to relax and quit worrying about the \\"How did they..?\\" questions that invariable crop up in any sci-fi book. The characters, while not always likable, are well-drawn and human (or not), and the changes they each go through while on Gaea raise thought-provoking questions about the effect of a powerful alien intelligence upon our own - and about our effect on the aliens. <br /> <br />I'd rate it PG-13, for a rape scene, implied incest and other sexual references, as well as some mildly disturbing violence. Highly recommended. <br />	2004-09-14

Unfortunately, Hannibal and the original Roman defeat - perhaps the most intriguing and interesting part of the story, and certainly ones which drew in many readers - are dealt with curtly in the first chapter. After that, the book skips forward over a hundred years, to characters we don't know and never really come to care about.  <br /> <br />The climax of the book - in which Roberts seems to be trying to evoke Antony and Cleopatra's battle of Actium (Roman general and his Egyptian queen vs. Rome and, in this case, Carthage) - is stirring, but I wish Roberts had more confidence in it. Every character involved is constantly dismissing the Egypt-Carthage war as a routine, not-particularly important campaign. No one really seems to stand much to lose, thus the reader doesn't really care who wins. <br /> <br />My biggest beef is that the alternative history in this book is either a) absurdly improbable, or b) not really all that different from the way things actually turned out. <br />	2004-09-07

Grouped together like this, the niggling little problems with each one amass into one or two huge glaring headaches.  <br /> <br />The premise of this book, of course, is that the Roman Empire never fell. Unlike most alternative history, this involves not just one point of departure, but a series of highly improbable occurrences that would allow the Empire - indeed, any empire - to last over 2500 years. If you can swallow that premise, you shouldn't have much trouble with any of the other stories in this book, give or take a few historical howlers. <br /> <br />The stories are interesting historical fiction, but not until the end do they become good alternate history.  90% of the book could conceivably have taken place during the actual time of the Roman Empire, and didn't need to be set in the 14th or 19th centuries at all.  <br /> <br />The stories are told from an interesting perspective, all of them narrated by someone close to the Imperial throne but usually lacking any real power or influence. Unfortunately, there is no continuity in the characters from one chapter to the next. Kim Stanley Robinson achieved this masterfully in \\"The Years of Rice and Salt\\"; given the many comparisons to his book I wish Silverburg could have done the same. With no main character to root for, the chapters remain a set of disjointed short stories - enjoyable in and of themselves, but I wish a bit more work had gone into turning them into a full-length novel.	2004-09-07

Jackal Segura is an overachieving teenager living and working under the auspices of the massive Ko Corporation. She is destined by her birthdate to become a Hope - a symbolic leader of the new World Government. She has a lover, a circle of friends, and a bright future - until a horrific accident turns her into a mass murderer. She is sentenced to forty years in prison, until an ironic choice is offered her - she can trade her sentence for participation in an experimental treatment based on Ko technology. Jackal will spend eight years locked in solitary Virtual Confinement within her own mind, while ten months of \\"real time\\" passes in the outside world.  <br /> <br />Despite the overwhelming impact of her time in mental prison, very little space is actually appointed to Jackal's eight year solitude. This is a disappointment, given that the book is not overly long and more time could easily have been spent with Jackal in Solitary without sacrificing any of what comes after. The unique nature of Jackal's confinement - which becomes very different from what her jailors originally intended - is just not explored fully enough, in my opinion. <br /> <br />What does come after, however, is what kept me reading. Jackal is forcibly relocated to a North American slum, where she is supported by Ko hush money since no one will hire her. She finds herself in the company of other notorious mass murderers (most of them female), even engaging in a dangerous flirtation with one. Most importantly, she finds Solitaire - a bar/nightclub designed to cater to \\"solos\\" - former VC inmates - and the cult of adoring fans that has sprung up around them. As Jackal tries to hide the exact nature of her time in VC from her probation officer (she fears, justifiably, that she will become a lab rat), she begins to realize just how Solitary changed her forever. <br /> <br />Eskridge takes a good, long look at a complicated future that is neither Utopic nor Dystopic, but a frightening combination of both, where privacy can become prison, strangers can be closer than family, and that which does not kill you does indeed make you stronger.  <br />	2004-09-07

Soon, she is sponsored into the elite military training school of the Girdsmen at Fin Panir. Then, again while on quest with the legendary paladins of Gird, she is gravely injured and finds her whole future is now in question. Once again, Elizabeth Moon's attention to detail and her understanding of military life serve to enrich the story. The only part I found it hard to swallow was Paks' sudden conversion to the fellowship of Gird; given her feelings in \\"Sheepfarmer\\", and with no real explanation of what motivated her to accept Gird (other than she could become a better fighter under Girdish tutelage), her religious fervor by the end of the book was a little puzzling. Still, it moves the story along, and the tales of Paks' adventures are always exciting. \\"Divided\\" suffers just a little from the \\"middle book\\" syndrome, still, by the end you can't wait to find out where her life leads her next.	2004-09-07

Unfortunately, I bought this book based on the glowing reviews which breathlessly promised a shocking story filled with plot twists and revelations, and was disappointed by a morality tale with a twist I saw coming within the first two chapters. Perhaps if my expectations hadn't been so high, I would have been less let down, but as it was I finished the book with a sense of &quot;That's it?&quot;<br />Out of deference to those who haven't read the book, I won't give the plot away, but savvy readers with even the vaguest hint of the genre will undoubtedly figure it out early on as I did, after which none of the supposed surprises will offer much additional excitement. Faber does show a mastery of written language, but he lays on his moral and metaphor so thick it overshadows any loveliness which might be taken away from the reading. Too much time is spent on the Scottish landscape, not enough on the characters, who remain frustratingly aloof right up to the end. <br />While certainly not awful or even particularly a chore to read (the 300 pages do fly by pretty quickly, thanks mostly to Faber's writing skill), this book fell flat in my opinion and, having been read once, does not offer much chance for a repeat engagement (a mortal sin in my bookshelves).	2004-07-11

I went into this book expecting (justifiably, from various reviews and blurbs) a story about a woman who faces the terrifying prospect of &quot;total assimilation&quot; into an alien species. <BR>Not. Juna's desertion on the alien planet isn't even permanent, only a 4 year period between when her ship leaves and when the next one is scheduled to return. She is never completely assimilated into the native Tendu culture, only enough to survive in the harsh environment, and she always remains an outsider. The Tendu are barely even alien, aside from their physical appearance (the Tendu talk with their skin, flashing colors and patterns on their own bodies, hence the reference in the title). <BR>That said, it is a good story, and Juna's transformation, while never separating her entirely from humanity, is intriguing. The Tendu as a whole aren't particularly likable, but that's OK - are aliens really supposed to be charming? There's a lot of description - of the ecology, of the Tendu, of their culture, etc - but it's interesting stuff, nonetheless, although the &quot;alien&quot; jungles sound more like the Amazon rainforest on acid than anything truly unique. <BR>Lighter fare than most first contact stories, OK but not particularly thought-provoking.	2004-06-03

That she doesn't is testament to the strength of the story and the ability of the authors to recreate a vivid and enthralling snapshot of life in 180 A.D. Austria.  As it is, she's an annoying distraction best dealt with by ignoring her as much as possible.<BR>The story is at its best when it reports, rather than editorializes. Nicole, a 21st-century single mom and lawyer, is whisked back to the days of the Roman Empire after an ill-thought out wish for a \\"simpler time\\". Once there, she finds herself on speaking terms with all four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as Plague is quickly followed by War and then inevitably Famine, with Death practically doing a jig on the sidelines in anticipation. Inhabiting the body of a widowed tavern keeper, Nicole is appallingly ignorant about certain facts of life yet adjusts quickly to others: she has no idea that women had no rights in 180 A.D. or that slavery was common, yet has no problem making change with unfamiliar currency or navigating the marketplace. About the fifth time she admitted that she had no idea who Marcus Aurelias was or when the Roman Empire actually fell (she's half-convinced that every disaster is going to be The End), I started wondering exactly where she went to college. <BR>Fortunately, once you tune out her judgmental rants (Allow me to summarize: \\"Men suck! Slavery is horrible! These people are all alcoholics! How dare these heathen pagans be mean to Christians! Spanking is child abuse! This place is sexist/filthy/smelly/just plain weird!\\") the story is actually pretty enjoyable, if somewhat overlong. There's no real climax, it's more a series of events that keep compounding on one another until Nicole finally accepts her life in Carnuntum - at which point she is whisked back to the 21st century and all her problems are solved. In between, wemeet a series of likable secondary characters, each with their own foibles and endearing traits, none of whom are immune to the tragedies and dangers of everyday life in the second century. The small pleasures of life that balance the miseries are sprinkled throughout, relieving the dark tone that never quite overwhelms the story. <BR>I doubt anyone who is not already interested in Roman history is going to slog through the whole thing, but for those who are this book offers a slice of life as it existed on the outskirts of the Empire - an slightly unusual, and thus refreshing, story.	2004-06-03

The \\"Sapphire Rose\\", of course, is the Bhelliom, an object of such enormous power that worlds literally revolve around it and Gods have fought wars for it. All Sparhawk cares about, though, is that it is the one thing that can save the life of his poisoned Queen, Ehlana. <BR>Ehlana's healed pretty early in, which leaves the rest of the book for Sparhawk to vanquish evil, destroy the Bad Guys, etc etc. See, once the Bhelliom resurfaces, Azash, the evil God of the Zemochs, knows who's got it. Since Bhelliom is the one thing Azash needs to free himself from his prison and take over the world, he's a little interested in getting Sparhawk to give it to him - or wresting it from his cold, dead hands, whichever's easiest. To that extent, there's a long, protracted section of the book devoted to the election of the Archprelate (the equivalent of the Pope) in the Holy City. If Annias, who secretly worships Azash, can buy enough votes, he wins, and Azash gets Bhelliom. So before Sparhawk can go off and kick immortal butt, he and his buddies have to head off this impending disaster first. It's political, it's complicated, and there are long sections where nothing happens but debate and voting. But it's also intelligent, witty, and gives several characters (including Ehlana) a chance to shine. Put it this way - if you think the political stuff in \\"Star Wars\\" is too complicated, you'll hate this part of the book. But if you enjoy that stuff, as I do, and seeing how wars are won by more than sword-waving, this book is fantastic. <BR>Of course, there's real action, too - Sparhawk does face down Azash, with some help (of course). Ehlana and Sparhawk get married - their love story is both awkward and romantic, and quite cute. And someone dies - I can't say who, but I cried when I read it. (And there's no \\"Man-with-two-lives\\" business as in the Belgariad.) <BR>The best book in a great series!	2004-06-03

Now Sparhawk has to track it down, dig it up, learn how to control it, and get it back to Ehlana, before the spell preserving her life fails, and those of his friends who are supporting the spell die with it. <BR>So Sparhawk and Co. trek across the continent, fighting a few battles, meeting a few characters (some of whom will become important later, so pay attention), avoiding the Bad Guys (as led by Annias, the churchman who's seized control of Ehlana's kingdom and is looking to take over the Church as well, and Martel, Sparhawk's nemesis) and learning much more than they planned about the REAL history of their world. We finally find out what the heck is the deal with Flute, the Styric orphan Sephrenia adopts, but as I said, this book mostly exists to keep Books 1 and 3 from bumping into each other.	2004-06-03

Juna returns to Earth, bringing her adopted son, Moki, and the elder Ukatonen, as ambassadors from the Tendu. It's supposed to be a reverse first-contact story, as the two Tendu learn to live among humans. Instead, it's a preachy discourse on how much humans as a race suck. <BR>What struck me was how, when Juna was marooned among the Tendu, they made her life hell and forced her to conform to their lifestyle. On Earth, everyone bends over backward to accommodate the Tendu, and they still complain. (At least, Ukatonen does. Moki just does a lot of things &quot;exuberantly&quot;.) We're made to feel guilty that the Tendu don't have any trees to play in. Well, cry me a river. Less guilt, more story!<BR>Much of the book is also focused on Juna's unexpected pregnancy by Bruce, the nice, sensitive, easy-going, Tendu-liking guy she met at the end of &quot;Distance&quot;. Except Bruce goes through a bizarre personality change that is completely unexplained, seemingly only for the purpose of creating an antagonist. <BR>If you like self-flagellation with your science fiction, go ahead and read it, but even as nature-is-so-much-better-than-technology stories go, this one is lacking.	2004-06-03

Follows Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter, a young provincial woman who joins a mercenary company at 18 and goes on to become a famous knight. Book One is about her days as a mercenary soldier. I was amazed at how detailed Moon's accounts of military life are. In some ways, this book is a little like &quot;By the Sword&quot; by Mercedes Lackey, but I would rate this by far as the better of the two. Paks is good, but not cocky, like Lackey's Kerowyn tends to be. She enjoys just being a common soldier, although her superiors notice something special about her from the first. Eventually, Paks becomes a key player in the main battle of the story, as several mercenary armies ally together to bring down  Count Siniava, the bad guy. <BR>At times, &quot;rich in detail&quot; can become just &quot;confusing&quot;, especially since (at least in the version I own) Moon spends a great deal of time on the importance of geography, but doesn't include a map. But if you enjoy more sword than sorcery, with likable (and perhaps even more important, believable!) characters, this is a great book.	2004-06-03

As &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; opens, England has been occupied for ten years by the Spanish forces of Phillip II, who holds it in the name of his daughter Isabella. Elizabeth is held in the Tower of London, most of the nobles of the realm have either been exiled or executed, and the weary populace shows little signs of resisting. But as Philip lies on his deathbed, a coup is planned by Elizabeth's faithful councilor William Cecil, who enlists the aid of the popular playwright William Shakespeare in a plot to inspire the English to rise against the occupation.<BR>As with most alternate history, you need to have a good grasp of how things actually went in order for the changes to make much sense. Many characters are familiar: Cecil, Shakespeare, Kit Marlowe, and Francis Bacon among them. Others may not be, such as Lieutenant Lope de Vega, Shakespeare's Spanish counterpart whose interest in his rival's latest work may unravel the whole plot. <BR>Shakespearean gems are scattered throughout, some in contexts guaranteed to elicit a chuckle. And, to Turtledove's credit, all the English dialogue is cast in an Elizabethan dialect. Depending on your familiarity with it, this can either be one of the book's greatest charms or its worst annoyance.<BR>Unfortunately, this is not an action-oriented book, and at almost 600 pages, that can be a real killer. There are scenes where characters are writing, where they are reading, and where they are talking, and scenes where they talk about reading what someone has written. Any actual action is jammed into a somewhat unsatisfying chapter at the end. This is a book about words and ideas, which may not appeal to everybody. Still, it is an original, witty, rich novel that makes for enjoyable, if not always easy, reading.	2004-06-03
US	50387488	R3VU8L8MZTURH7	0553575422	391056416	Luck in the Shadows (Nightrunner, Vol. 1)	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Very enjoyable!	The first book by Flewelling I read was \\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\", a much darker start to a second fantasy series that is actually a prequel to her Nightrunner series. Got that? So, having finished that book, I turned back to Flewelling's first series, a much lighter, more contemporary set.<br />\\"Luck in the Shadows\\" tells the story of a young country bumpkin, Alec, who gets mixed up with a thief and spy named Seregil. They save each other's lives, and Seregil agrees to take Alec on as an apprentice. He brings Alec to Rhiminee, the capital city of Skala, a peaceful kingdom that, by decree of an ancient prophecy, is always ruled by a Queen. (Nice touch.) Seregil is distantly related to the current Queen and is part of a secret society of spies and sorcerers that help protect Skala from her enemies.<br />A lot of this first book is given over to Alec's training as a beginning spy. The subplot, which sets up action for Book 2, is actually more interesting than the main plot, which is thrown in about 2/3 in and feels both rough and rushed. It involves a secret conspiracy against the Queen, forged documents, stolen gold - basic fare, dealt with matter-of-factly and with few surprises. The subplot, concluded in Book 2, is also pretty standard - evil artifact which will destroy the world - but as it places our heroes in much more personal and immediate danger, we end up caring about it more.<br />Flewelling can't seem to decide whether Alec should be a prodigy or a victim of his own helplessness; he's breaking and entering like an expert within a week, but he still can't find his way around the big, bad city. I wish there were more female characters; aside from the Queen (a very minor character at best) and the daughters of Seregil's friend Micum, almost everyone in this book is a man. The fact that Seregil is gay helps a little, but still. Oh, well, you can't have anything. The series does improve down the pike, so if you're looking for light, fun fantasy, this is worth theinvestment.	2004-04-29

Finally, a fantasy novel where the world described is actually a literal fantasy of mine! A world where novels have replaced sports, movies, and television as the most popular form of entertainment: where proselytizers knock on your door and ask if you've found Sir Francis Bacon, schoolchildren trade Austen and Bronte playing cards, and &quot;Richard III&quot; is staged weekly as an audience-participation cult favorite a la &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;. I LOVE this world, and all its quirks: 1980s England, in the midst of a 131-year war with Russia, where time-travel, vampirism, and jumping in and out of books are all commonplace. <br />Thursday Next is the name of the reluctant heroine of this book, dragged into a first-class mess when it's discovered that she once rebuffed the future villain Acheron Hades in college. After he's turned to a life of crime, *no one* can resist Hades (who has several other supernatural powers), so when it's suspected he's stolen a first edition Dickens manuscript with the intent of causing harm to its characters, Thursday is brought in to help stop him. <br />A host of secondary characters make appearances, from Thursday's mad-scientist Uncle Mycroft, to the wickedly delightful Acheron Hades, to the helpful and mysterious Edward Rochester from the eponymous book (also in peril) himself. The witty use of names and puns is always lighthearted, rarely dragging (as similar Douglas Adams jokes tend to be) and they never obscure the main plot. The in-jokes are numerous, but if you haven't read the books they're based on you won't really miss anything. <br />If you love literature, you MUST read this book - at the very least to escape to a world where everyone shares your passion.	2004-04-27

You can practically hear her telling a bride, &quot;Oh, dear, you DID plan on loosing some of that weight, didn't you?&quot; Some of her tips on cutting costs without sacrificing quality were very helpful, but she just can't rein in the judgmental attitude that says, &quot;Any bride who doesn't do it MY WAY is a horrible horrible person whose friends will all hate her.&quot; McCoy toots her own horn as a wedding planner over and over again, giving us at least one story per chapter about how she single-handedly saved some poor clueless bride's wedding day. Her tips would have been much more helpful if she were less rigid in her (often contradictory, often old-fashioned) etiquette and &quot;elegance&quot; rules. Her views on what is mandatory and what is unnecessary are completely out of touch with what most brides want, but she sets them down as absolutes that should not under any circumstances be deviated from. (For instance: Videographer, mandatory; limo, unnecessary. Hello???) <BR>That said, she does offer some good tips, for instance recipes and instructions on making your own wedding cake and a great chapter on selecting engagement rings. If you can get this book from your library, you might glean some good ideas from it, but I would never recommend that you rely exclusively on this book when planning your wedding.	2004-02-19

Better known as the William half of England's William and Mary, he helped cement Protestantism in England and make the fledgling Netherlands an actual power in Europe. <br />However, the novel's narrator, Queen Mary, takes a rather dimmer view of William. I suppose it's her prerogative, since she had to live with him. Still, I would rather Plaidy had based her condemnation of William on something a little more than the fact that a spoiled princess didn't like his serious nature. This is a symptom, of course, of the larger malady that aflicts any historical novel that features women characters.  Invariably, even the most powerful queens are reduced to vapid, fluttering girls who rule their countries by batting their eyelashes and choose kings by virtue of how their manly legs look in tights, then express vague, hurt confusion when things go wrong. <br />Here, vapid Lady Mary becomes vapid Princess Mary and, eventually, vapid Queen Mary when her uncle, King Charles, dies and the people (with the help of William) oust her Catholic father, James II. Mary, who has been sent to Holland after her marriage to William and hates it, is torn between loyalty to her father, whom she loves but has no respect for, and her husband, whom she has respect for but mildly despises. William spends a lot of time off at war or diddling his mistress, Mary pouts but manages to be a reasonably competent ruler in his absence, then she forgives both her father and husband and dies of smallpox. That's about it.<br />I was disappointed, but I think that's more because I had very specific expectations for this book - I wanted to read more about Mary's life in Holland and the politics there, rather than her endless dithering about whether she's betraying her father and how mean William is to her. The actual politics and history - which are hugely significant, and also complimentary to Mary, who as I said turned out to be a pretty good Queen - are downplayed, and somewhat condescendingly so.<br />A perfectly nice, easy read for anyone interested in the period, but it would make little sense to anyone who's not.	2004-02-18

Therefore, my comments will tend to be skewed in favor of the Elenium, although most readers who read the Belgariad first will be more in favor of that series. It's a direct result of the fact that Edding's major flaw is a tendency to plagiarize himself, rather obviously. Therefore, if two books or plots are all but identical, the second one will almost invariably be set in your mind as a poorer copy. <br />Anyways. The story opens with an old and battered knight, Sparhawk, returning home to the kingdom of Elenia after ten years of exile. The old king who exiled him is dead, and the new Queen Ehlana, whom Sparhawk tutored as a child, has pardoned him. But when he gets home, he finds that Ehlana came down with a deathly illness shortly after her coronation, and that to save her life, Sparhawk's old teacher in magic, the Styric sorceress Sephrenia, has placed her in a state of suspended animation, frozen in a block of crystal. Before they can bring her out, they have to find a cure for whatever illness Ehlana has. Sparhawk, of course, immediately signs up for the quest to save his queen.<br />Along the way, he picks up various companions, including four other knights from various kingdoms, in a sort of joint effort of unity among the many orders of knights. That's the explanation given, at least, although of course the real reason is that Eddings absolutely loves creating secondary characters, and a quest story is always better the more people there are involved. There's plenty of sword-and-sorcery, a few monsters, but not so much that you feel like you're alienated from the universe he's in. (I think he does a much better job in this respect here than with the Belgariad, but again that's just me.)<br />Say what you will, but Eddings really is good at creating characters that you can truly like and care about. And you can never go wrong with your basic quest story, which gets wonderful treatment here. I love this series, and \\"Diamond Throne\\" is an excellent start to it.	2004-02-18
US	50387488	R776SSPKB3TB	0553580531	409245980	Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The Greatest Defeat in the History of Western Civilization	The Battle of Thermopylae is generally regarded as one of the greatest military engagements of all time.  It took place in ancient Greece, between the legendary warriors of Sparta and the huge army of the Persians under Xerxes. Remember him from Western Civ class? Yeah, me neither. But I returned to this book after taking Western Civ recently, after my first attempt at slogging through it failed. This is definitely a book that goes down easier with some background info; even basic knowledge about the Greek city-states will help.<br />It's not giving away much to give a brief outline of the battle. Basically, 300 Spartans (or Lakedaemonians, as they called themselves) defended a single mountain pass into Greece against about 2 million Persians. Yes, 300 - and they held the pass for 3 days, too, long enough for their allies to muster a resistance at Athens that would eventually defeat the Persians for good. The story is told in flashback, the conceit being that one Spartan has survived the siege and is brought to Xerxes, who wants to know more about these heroic soldiers who didn't seem to care that they were fighting a suicide mission and who, despite their inevitable defeat, gave the Persians a hellacious ass-whomping for a few days there.<br />The narrator is in fact a former slave serving as a squire to one of the Spartan warriors, which allows for plenty of gushing about the Spartans' prowess. The 3 days of the battle itself come at the end of the book, allowing plenty of time to flesh out the character of the Spartans and a little bit about ancient Greece before getting down to the blood and glory.<br />And glory it is. If you choked up during `Braveheart' or `Gladiator', expect a teary moment or two here as well. What makes this story all the more poignant is the fact that it is, so far as we can tell after several thousand years, completely true. The epitaph described in the book - &quot;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by/That here obedient to their laws we lie&quot; - actually exists, carved into the rocks of the Gates of Fire and still visible today. <br />The first half drags a bit - sometimes more than a bit. The narration itself twists and turns and winds its way, often confusingly, through the story. And again, if you don't have at least some idea of who the Athenians and Corinthians, et al, are, you're going to have no idea what the heck is going on.<br />Still, the Battle of Thermopylae is famous today. (Remember `The Last Samurai'? Tom Cruise mentions Thermopylae when he's planning the suicidal final battle of the samurai.) Steven Pressfield's novel does a great job explaining how a single 3 day battle could survive as the single greatest defeat in the history of Western Civilization.	2004-02-12

The Netherlands was also the commerce capital of the world, the first modern republic, and famous throughout Europe for its religious tolerance. <br />All three of these aspects come into play in this book, whose main character is Miguel Lienzo, a Portuguese Jew who flees the Inquisistion and finds acceptance in Amsterdam.  He finds that his skill in lying, honed by years of pretending to be a Catholic, serves him well as a merchant and eventually a broker on the Stock Exchange. Unfortunately, as the book opens, he has just lost a fortune in a bad trade and finds himself in serious debt. So when a Dutchwoman acquaintance offers him a chance to be her partner in a scheme designed to take advantage of an obscure commodity - coffee - he jumps at the chance to regain his fortune, his luck, and his reputation.<br />The details of the scheme - whereby they will establish a monopoly on coffee, simultaneously creating interest in this new &quot;drink of commerce&quot; and manipulating its price - are complicated and ever-changing, as the expected complications arise.  At first, the pace is slow enough that Liss does a pretty good job of explaining just what is going on on the floor of the Exchange - what a future is, how stocks and money exchange hands, that sort of thing. And his descriptions of the Exchange itself are great - imagine Wall Street, if it were only open for two hours each day and held in an outdoor courtyard. But as the plot thickens, and moves and countermoves are made more and more desperately, it's increasingly hard to follow the flow of trading. This is a distraction, but it's a slight one, and it's possible to follow the story without understanding every detail of the Exchange.<br />The plot twists themselves are another matter.  Crosses and double-crosses fly past you so quickly its impossible to remember who's onwhat side, or what hidden motivations each character is keeping secret from the others.  Major characters move to the background, minor characters come rushing in at the last minute to have a huge impact, and on occasion you're as helplessly confused as poor Lienzo.<br />For all these faults, I still greatly enjoyed this book. It brings new depth to an era that is on the verge of becoming cliched, and it exposes a hidden underworld few of us are familiar with. My mom, who was born in Holland, read &quot;The Coffee Trader&quot; before she gave it to me, and while she didn't like it as much as I did, she said it was fascinating to her the way the Dutch were portrayed.  I agree.  In the end, the real hero of this book might not be Lienzo, or any of his colleagues, or even the coffee of the title.  I think it's the city of Amsterdam and its people that are the stars here.	2004-02-10

Everyone knows that the (in)famous conquistador Cortes was only able to conquer the Aztecs, the ruling tribe of Tenochtitlan, because they pretty much rolled over and gave in. Most people also know that the Mexican natives bent over backwards for Cortes and his white-skinned followers because they thought the Europeans were gods. This novel expounds upon that misconception, giving us a greater insight into what the heck those Aztecs were thinking and how a tiny band of a few hundred Spanish soldiers was able to defeat the largest and richest city in the world.<br />According to Falconer, Malinali, the Aztec woman largely responsible for spreading the rumor that Cortes was the god Quetzalcoatl (Feathered Serpent), was indeed a real historical figure whose role in the Mexican conquest is still a subject of hot debate today. I can believe it. Lay aside the fact that she purportedly helped murder, enslave, and impoverish her own people (unintentionally or not - Falconer doesn't pass any judgment), and you're faced with the troubling implication that the fate of a continent hinged upon - gasp - a woman. <br />Falconer paints Malinali as a woman so traumatized by her cruel treatment by her Aztec mother, who sold her into slavery as a child, and inflamed by the prophecies of her father, a priest of Quetzalcoatl, that she seizes upon Cortes' arrival as a fulfillment of her destiny. She believes she is meant to be Quetzalcoatl's handmaiden, and once she becomes his translator she proudly announces this fact to every Mexican native they come across. The theme of Mali's mistranslations becomes an important one, as she paints a picture to the Aztecs that is quite different than the one Cortes had in mind, then is confused when her god doesn't live up to her expectations. <br />The descriptions of Aztec (and, to a lesser extent, Mayan) culture, religion, and architecture are wonderful, both achingly beautiful and unbelievably savage.  Mali is a fascinating character, at once abhorrent and heroic. Cortes is predictably arrogant and destructive, yet Falconer avoids the simplistic, &quot;Europeans bad/Natives good&quot; P.C. interpretation of events that has become almost universally accepted. He is careful to include the larger justifications why the Europeans thought they were entitled to rule the New World (i.e., the pope said they could), and points out that Christianity did have some advantages over the Aztec religion, namely that it doesn't involve human sacrifice. Then again, as one character points out, plenty of people have died in the name of the Christian religion, too. This ambiguity between which religion is \\"better\\" highlights the bitter reality behind the clash of cultures: in the end, there is no one &quot;right&quot; side, or &quot;good&quot; guys. The characters are all mixtures of piety, ruthlessness, good intentions, arrogance, compassion, and cruelty. This makes them amazingly human, and the story of the Mexican conquest all the more tragic. You're left wondering if there was any way the story could have had a better outcome, or if the destruction was inevitable.  Falconer deserves kudos for acknowledging the complexity of his source material and creating a story that never condescends to its victims nor exonerates its heroes.	2004-02-03

Now the Acharites (members of the human kingdom of Achar) are terrified of trees and tell their children horror stories of the &quot;Forbidden&quot;. So at first, when rumors of monsters attacking in the north hit the capital, it's assumed to be these Forbidden. But when Axis, the leader of the Acharite religion's military order, finds two old monks who have spent years studying the literature of the Forbidden, they tell him about a strange Prophecy that foretold this whole mess. Turns out, these monsters aren't the Forbidden at all, they're the minions of a Very Bad Guy, Gorgrael. And the only way to defeat him is to unite with the Forbidden, under the rule of a certain StarMan. Axis and his men gradually come to believe this Prophecy, aided along by plenty of mystical occurrences and startling revelations, naturally. There's a side story involving Faraday, the girl Axis falls in love with who ends up marrying his brother, and has her own part to play in the Prophecy, and plenty of well-drawn secondary characters.<br />The climactic battle really isn't, being more of a series of rather disheartening skirmishes, but since this is the first in a series, you can't really expect the good guys to trounce the bad guys triumphantly right at first. The plot twists are more like discoveries, as the characters come together and their relationships are formed and reformed. The writing is above average; not superb, but very readable. Oh, and while by the second book this changes, for the first 3/4 of this book, women are relegated to the &quot;wait and pine and wring their hands&quot; role, so if you're a &quot;sword and sorceress&quot; type like me, just hang in there. (Don't be fooled by the cover drawing of requisite Hot Female Warrior with Very Few Clothes on - I have no idea who she isor where she comes in. Hey, who cares?)	2004-02-03

Vermeer painted a relative few works, most of them quiet, domestic scenes with none of the grandeur of \\"Night Watch\\" or vibrancy of \\"Sunflowers\\". \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\", indeed, is probably his most famous work.  In the book of the same title, Tracy Chevalier creates a fictional muse to inspire this mysterious portrait.<br />Griet, the narrator, is a young maid in the home of Vermeer.  She falls quietly in love with her master, who allows her in to clean his studio and mix his paints, introducing her to a world of color and beauty unheard of in the life of a 17th century Protestant servant.  Vermeer, in turn, is fascinated with Griet, perhaps goaded on by a rivalry with his lascivious patron. Eventually, he paints Griet wearing his wife's pearl earrings.  The fallout from this act affects both of their life, and perhaps the history of Dutch Golden Age art, forever.<br />If anything is wrong with this story, it is what it lacks.  Griet as a character remains closed off from the reader for the entire length of the book.  We get almost no insights into her personality, no expressions of emotion, and thus it's impossible to empathize with her.  Vermeer is by turns callous and understanding, which could make for a wonderfully complex character but instead comes off as inconsistent and hastily drawn.  The town of Delft itself gets the shaft - I've been there, and even I couldn't make sense of the layout of the streets and districts, or get any sense of how beautiful the town truly is.  <br />The relationship between Griet and Vermeer could have been an intriguing study of class difference and how it affects relationships, how a subtle abuse of power can destroy someone who's helpless to say no, how the abused can love her abuser.  Instead, we get no real sense of why Griet continues to idolize Vermeer, nor why he treats her the way he does.  To Chevalier's credit, she keeps their relationship platonic, with only a few moments of sexual tension.  The relationship between maid and master is volatile enough without throwing gratuitous sex into it, in my opinion.<br />Overall, if you're already interested in art, the Dutch Golden Era, or hopeless love stories, this is a lovely book. I doubt it will win any converts, although the movie might change all of that. (This is one of the few instances where I think the movie might be better than the book, since by definition writing about art is going to be awkward.) Speaking of, my recommendation is to get the edition that has the original painting on the cover, rather than the scene from the movie. When Chevalier starts discussing Griet's sitting for the portrait, it's helpful to have it in front of you.	2004-02-03

We'd better send her twin brother, who's an idiot but at least not evil, after her, along with the requisite wise and condescending wizard who can patiently explain to him why it's his duty to fight against all these evil women and why it's certainly not the WIZARDS' fault the women turned to evil in the first place, nosiree, we didn't do NUTHIN' that would have pushed them over the edge, nuh-huh! (It never occurs to anyone in this book that the sexist practice of forbidding women to learn magic from the good wizards ensures that they can only learn magic from the evil ones. Duh.)<br />I tried to look past this, I honestly did. I gritted my teeth every time women were equated with Everything Wrong With the World and kept reading. I swallowed my sarcastic comments every time someone told the main character that it was because he was \\"the male\\" of the set of twins that he was the \\"Chosen One\\" of Prophecy. I tried to ignore all the other problems with this book, too - like the way the main character, Tristan, would do something stupid and reckless, and everyone would shake their heads and murmur amongst themselves, \\"If only he knew the truth,\\" and then NOT EXPLAIN WHAT TRUTH HE'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW, and leave both him and us wondering what the HECK is going on, especially when he CONTINUES doing stupid and reckless things because the author wanted to maintain an aura of \\"mystery\\" to keep his reader \\"intrigued\\". Then there's the obsession with \\"pure\\" blood, which is mentioned pretty much on every page. If you don't have pure blood, you're not worth wasting time on, as far as the main characters are concerned, and the purer your blood (i.e. untainted by \\"common\\" blood) the better. Wait, where have I heard this before... Oh yeah, it's called \\"eugenics\\". And let's not forget the homophobia. I can't even count how many times lesbianism was referred to as an example of \\"depravity\\".  In fact, the entire book reads like a Catholic schoolboy's guilt-inducing wet dream, with hot Asian women dressed in black leather S&M gear and PG-rated girl-on-girl action, all of which induces \\"shock\\" and \\"horror\\" in the virtuous males that are forced to witness it. Inevitably, this leads to Tristan being \\"raped\\" (forced to have sex with the evil sorceresses) several times over the course of the book because he's just soooo desirable. Honestly, this is just a Freudian analysis waiting to happen.<br />Which brings us to the women. I don't mind villainesses. In fact, an evil female character is far preferable to a meek, stay-at-home-and-wring-her-hands, passive and pretty sidekick. My favorite fictional villain of all time is a woman (Melisande, from Jacqueline Carey's \\"Kushiel\\" series). What I do have a problem with is when a male author paints every single female character as either inherantly evil, or so weak-willed that she can easily be swayed to the side of evil, and every male character as either good, or bad only because he's been tempted and seduced by those evil evil women. All of this speaks to me of Major Issues that should have been dealt with BEFORE the book was written. Not only is it offensive, but it makes for dull, unlikable characters and a plot that manages to be both stagnant and overly complicated. People, it's called \\"motivation\\", and it SHOULD be what drives the characters along and makes them interesting. \\"Just because\\" doesn't count as character development. Quite frankly, by the end of the book I was rooting for the outcome where the sorceresses blow up this rascist, sexist, and homophobic world and everyone in it ceases to exist.	2004-01-26

I don't know why, but I'm biased against books that try to over-analyze and &quot;scientize&quot; (I know that's not a word) magic. And this book made me realize just how much it really aggravates me.<br />It's not a bad book, otherwise - a half-Hindu, half-English young woman leaves India for England after her parents die under mysterious circumstances. Maya sets up practice as a doctor (setting up plenty of opportunities for Lackey to expound upon how hard women had it back then), only to discover that her trouble seems to have followed her. Enter Peter, a member of a stuffy, old-boys club of Mages, who feels out her power and starts to teach her. Together, they face down both Maya's enemy and the misogynistic views of the Mages, saving the world for white Englishmen everywhere. <br />Once again, Lackey is obsessed with animals that have extraordinary powers (but Maya's pets are lame compared to her Valdemar Companions). Her descriptions of turn-of-the-century London are picturesque, and while she does tend to preach about suffrage and women's equality, she does have a point. <br />No, what I really can't stand is the smug, technical, know-it-all-manner in which she presents magic. I'm a Pagan, and a witch, and I know a lot about magic. Lackey seems to have read one or two books, latched onto a few minor but colorful and easily-understood parts of a huge metaphysical structure, and expounded on them to her own content. Her attempts to compare and mesh the Hindu religion with Western ideas about magic fail miserably, and the fact that she blindly presents all of this as common sense that everyone should know by know grates on my last psychic nerve. I preferred the entirely fictitious system she created for the Valdemar series, where while her over-analysis of it (as though trying to prove to the reader, and herself, that her ideas make sense) is tedious, at least it's not bastardizing anyone else's beliefs. <br />Still, if you don't have any baggage concerning magic or mythology, I suppose there's no reason you can't enjoy this book.	2004-01-23

Even those somewhat over the top touches, however, could have been pulled off if the rest of the plot were less bodice-ripping, swooning-in-her-lover's-arms, torn-between-two-worlds melodramatic. <br />The basic story is, well, basic: Pretty younger wife married to old but rich husband falls in love with talented yet penniless painter. Ah, chuckles Benevolent Yet Oblivious Hubby, kids these days, with their heaving bosoms and trembling lips! Let me invite Hot Young Artist back into my home again and again, since it amuses my Modest and Demure Young Wife so! Let me rejoice when Young Wife suddenly, after years of barrenness, becomes conveniently pregnant! <br />You can see how this becomes tiresome after awhile. Do we sympathize with poor Sophia, stuck in her marriage with a man she doesn't love while her lover awaits her in a seedy apartment in the Jordaan slums? Sure. Can we appreciate her pluck when she devises several implausible, &quot;that's so crazy it just might work&quot; schemes in order to keep up with her mounting indiscretions? OK. Do we want to beat all three (four, if you count the maid who ends up becoming entangled in the whole mess) of them upside the head and tell them to get a clue? You bet.<br />The twist at the end, which brings the whole house of cards crashing down, is the best part of the whole book. I laughed aloud, then felt a little guilty about it, then shrugged and settled back in with a smirk on my face. Schadenfreude is a wonderful thing.<br />Tulip Fever was a very real phenomena in 17th century Holland, akin to the Internet bubble of the 90s. When the market crashed, countless people lost everything. The ups and downs of the tulip craze were, in my opinion, quite exciting and dramatic enough, without turning them into a deus ex machina in a morality play. Too complicated to be beach reading, too bosom-heaving to be serious historical fiction. Too bad.	2004-01-21

It's the story of one woman's life, and as such it encompasses periods of great change and periods of stasis, upheaval and peace, passion, contentment, and anguish. If you're looking for a book about monumental events with a larger-than-life heroine, this book is not for you. If you're looking to be utterly captivated by how one woman can change history and be changed by it, you'll love &quot;The Red Tent&quot;.<BR>The title of the book underscores its greatest theme: that of the sisterhood of women that transcends generations, religions, and cultures. Dinah grows up secure of her place within this sisterhood, only to find herself cast adrift from it in one moment of savagery and violence. Her journey from her childhood home in Canaan to the home she makes for herself in Egypt parallels her search to once again find a place where she belongs as much as she did with her mothers in the tent.<BR>Leah, Zilpah, Rachel, and Bilhah, the wives of Jacob and the mothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, are also central characters. Anyone who gets riled up by any suggestion that the Bible is not 100%, verbatim, word-for-word truth from the mouth of God should also avoid this book. Not that Diamant drastically alters the story - far from it. But she introduces crucial details that are lacking in the original, as well as resolving several inconsistencies and contradictions. (For example, Jacob working 7 months instead of 7 years each for Leah and Rachel. If he had worked 14 years before marrying Rachel, she would have been almost 30 and completely unmarriagable. Diamant's scenario only makes sense.) If an author doesn't add or alter any details from her source, than what's the point in writing a book at all? In addition, the women of Jacob's family are not Jewish - Judaism didn't exist yet. I've read several reviews that take offense to this aspect of the book and claim that it's pagan propaganda. Far from it. Think about it: Early Christians considered themselves a faction of Judaism for several generations after the death of Jesus. Likewise, the exclusive worship of El was simply a sect of the polytheistic Canaanite religion for years, until the followers of El wiped out the followers of every other god and goddess in the region hundreds (if not thousands) of years later.<BR>Dinah's story is one of an ordinary woman caught up in events beyond her comprehension, who escapes from a life where she is pulled back and forth between the whims and desires of men, only to find that greed, like love, exists everywhere. Dinah's courage, like Leah's pride, Zilpah's spirituality, Rachel's beauty, and Bilhah's compassion, overcomes the boundaries of time and culture and underlines the universal nature of womanhood in a lovely, rich, and epic tale.	2004-01-13

As sexy (maybe more so) as \\"Killing Dance\\", with, in my opinion, a tighter plot and a tad less lecturing. Eeeexcellent. Downside: no Jean-Claude (Anita, if you don't want him, there are plenty of women who would), as the werewolf Richard finally gets another chance with the woman who left him for a vampire. <br />The book opens with Anita being called out of town to help Richard defend himself against rape charges. Naturally, he's being set-up, for the sole purpose of getting him out of the way so the bad guys can do their thing. And naturally, this makes both Anita and Richard stubbornly stick around, very much in harm's way, to thwart their evil-doing. Anita's brought a couple of Richard's werewolves and some of her wereleopards, and with the local werewolf pack, there's a lot of the same discussions about lycanthrope protocol that marred \\"Killing Dance\\"; thankfully, Hamilton seems to have toned it down a bit, or maybe she just ran out of things to say.<br />Much is made of Anita's position as default \\"lupa\\" of the werewolves, since Richard hasn't picked another consort since she left him. The wolves don't much like being led by a human - if Anita even is human. It wouldn't be an Anita Blake novel if she didn't gain some sort of new power, so suffice it to say she learns a lot about how to be a lupa by the end of the book. (Her dubious status as Richard's ex-lover is resolved, too - and it's just as hot as anything she's shared so far with Jean-Claude.)  <BR> <br />Sometimes Hamilton still stretches things a bit; certain elements are just on the verge of being forced. I'm not sure if I belong to the \\"this is the beginning of the end\\" school of thought, although if you think that sex is the downfall of this series than assume that from this point forward you'll be disappointed. Personally, I love the fact that Anita collects lovers like shoes; the fact that so many men are falling all over themselves for her is great! Sex and violence is not for everyone, but if you're not afraid of a strong woman who doesn't always take the high road, you'll be in love with Anita too.	2004-01-11

What a mess this confusing jumble of pseudo-history, pseudo-feminist, pseudo-dark fantasy novel is - or should I say pseudo-novel? And what a disappointment from Sara Douglass, whose &quot;Wayfarer Redemption&quot; series I actually admired.<br />I honestly don't know where to start. How about with the characters, not a single one of which is likable or admirable in any way. Each one is invariably one or more of the following: cruel, shallow, power-mad, spoiled, self-centered, whining, manipulative, duplicitous, and vindictive. Brutus, the male &quot;protagonist&quot;, rapes his 15-year-old wife Cornelia on their wedding night, smacks her around repeatedly (including once while she is in labor with their son), and cheats on her with Genvissa, a blasphemous priestess who has sucked dry her own goddess in her lust for power. Lovely. We're supposed to feel OK about this, because Cornelia forgives him and moons around after him regardless. Oh yeah, she's an inspiring heroine for women everywhere.<br />Then there's the plot, such as it is, a jumbled mish-mash of Greek and pre-Celtic mythological references used to support an utterly transparent and preposterous storyline that involves a disinherited patricidal Trojan (Brutus) and a spoiled and self-centered Greek princess (Cornelia) who travel to what will eventually become Britain to establish a new Troy. They're led there by Genvissa, an evil Llangarlian priestess (Llangarlia must be the silliest fantasy name I've yet to encounter) who wants access to the power Brutus wields over the Troy Game, an all-but-extinct form of labyrinth magic. Intrigued yet? Oh wait, there's more. Fathers rape daughters, sons kill mothers (and those are the *good* guys), and there is quite possibly the most disgusting and graphic miscarriage scene I have ever read. (No one who has ever given birth, or ever intends to, should read this scene. Do the words &quot;ruptured placenta&quot; mean anything to you?) <br />I don't mind characters that are a mix of good and bad; Douglass' previous hero, Axis, did some pretty crappy things while he was saving the world and didn't feel too darn bad about it.  But there's a difference between a character who starts flawed and has to redeem themselves, or one who has to do some rotten things for the greater good, and a character who's just a jerk. I literally wanted to wash my hands when I set this book down. Don't waste the money.	2004-01-11

I avoided the &quot;Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter&quot; novels for a long time for the same reason I didn't watch &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; until the third season - it sounded too cheesy to be any good. Of course, &quot;Buffy&quot; became one of my favorite shows, and &quot;Anita Blake&quot; is really starting to grow on me, too, and for the same reason - the strength of the characters, particularly the secondary ones, which outweighs the corniness of some of the plots. <br />Naturally, anyone is going to make comparisons between Anita and Buffy - look, see, I just did - but in truth, they're not all that similar. Both feature short, but very tough, women who hunt vampires, yet carry on a tortured love affair with one. Beyond that, though, there's not much in common. In Anita's world, vampirism is legal. She's the Vampire Executioner for the St. Louis area - called in by the police to handle vampires who break the law. Beyond that, she's an animator - a zombie-raiser (another paranormal business conducted out in the open), and a police consult for supernatural crimes. Naturally, all these job descriptions invariably collide in each novel.<br />Sometimes the dialogue (or monologue, since they're told first-person) gets a little stilted. Hamilton pushes Anita's &quot;I'm small, but I'm tough&quot; routine a bit too far sometimes, and the endless repetition of exactly which guns and/or knives she's wearing and how she's carrying them gets a little tedious. And a few books in, when you realize the pattern of 3 different subplots all being related somehow, (ie, monsters hire Anita to find menace threatening them, strange client hires Anita to raise the dead, Anita's love interest has a deep dark secret), it loses some of its punch. <br />Nevertheless, I *like* Anita, and I like a lot of the secondary characters, too - even if most of them are on the side of the monsters. The stories are both fun and gruesome - a nice balance, somewhere between fluff beach reading and gnawing-on-your-fingernails.	2004-01-11

Why? Because it finally fulfills the promise of 5 previous books' worth of sexual tension between Anita and her two suitors, the vampire Jean-Claude and the werewolf Richard. And trust me, things do not turn out the way you'd expect.<br />As always, there are several subplots in this book that ultimately get woven together. One has Anita learning there's been a half-million dollar hit placed on her. Another involves a request from one of Jean-Claude's vampiric rivals, Sabin, to heal his disfiguring disease. And then there's Richard, who finally grows a pair and decides to go forward with his coup of his werewolf pack, throwing out the old leaders, Marcus and Raina. <br />If, however, you're like me and you care more about the characters than the eighty-seven guns Anita carries and exactly how she uses them, all you're going to care about is that Anita finally makes her choice between her boyfriends, after several steamy scenes with each (and one with both!). The relationship between all three takes a surprising turn, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it's handled in forthcoming books. <br />The only downside is the often-interminable descriptions of werewolf culture. Every time we turn around, there's another (often contradictory) point of protocol that has to be explained to Anita. Frankly, Hamilton gets carried away, instead of making it a simple hierarchy. It's all an effort to make the final showdown between Marcus and Richard a fairer fight, but it gets in the way of us believing that lycanthropes live normal lives three and a half weeks out of every month. <br />On the other hand, maybe reminding us that the werewolves aren't human was Hamilton's point, since Anita's acceptance of Richard's double life is key here. After nagging him for months to accept violence, can she really handle seeing her maybe-fiancé rip out someone's throat with his teeth? What about Jean-Claude, who looks like he may be willing to give up on ever being with Anita? (And this may be the first time, apart from a kiss in the very first book in the series, that I really believed how in love with her he is.) Oh, yeah, and someone wants Anita dead, bad (although the revelation of who took out the hit is anticlimactic at best), which brings mysterious hit man Edward back to her side in the dubious role of protector.<br />The best book to date in an above-average series. Very high on sex and violence (sometimes at the same time).	2004-01-11

It takes places somewhere after the \\"Vows and Honor\\" series and before \\"Queen's Own\\", and tells the story of the legendary Captain Kerowyn. Kero is Kethry's granddaughter, although she barely knows her mage grandmother. Her sexist father wants to keep her chained in the kitchen, but Kero wants adventure and excitement. When bandits crash her brother's wedding, killing most of the guests and taking the bride prisoner, Kero rides to the rescue, making her both a hero and a pariah to her brother and father. So she hikes off to Grandmother's, where Tarma takes her on as a student. Later, she joins a mercenary company, then captains said company, and finally ends up being Chosen by a Valdemaran Companion. (If she didn't, we wouldn't really care about her, would we?) Along the way she falls in love, has numerous adventures, setbacks, foreshadowy meetings with important people, etc etc. <br />Good book, especially for Mercedes Lackey. I liked Elizabeth Moon's Paksenarrion series better, but you can't ask for everything. Nice, basic sword-and-sorceress tale, ties up a few loose ends re: Kethry and Tarma, and sets up the \\"modern\\" Valdemar series at the same time. Although it's technically a stand-alone, don't bother if you don't have at least a basic grasp of Lackey's universe already. If you do, you'll probably like this one.	2004-01-11

A retelling of the old fairy tale, &quot;The Seven Swans&quot;. Set in Ireland, at a point where Christianity and the Old Religion still coexist. Sorcha is the youngest of 7 motherless children. Their father, Lord of Sevenwaters, has been mostly indifferent to his daughter and six sons, and eventually, when Sorcha is 15 or so, he marries again. Too bad that his wife is an evil sorceress, who turns the six brothers into swans when they threaten her plans. Sorcha, who escapes, is advised by the Queen of the Fairies that there's a loophole - if she can weave six shirts of nettles, remaining silent the whole time, and throw them over the swans' heads, the enchantment will be lifted. <br />So begins her ordeal, which sees her first grubbing in the wilderness alone, and later a prisoner/guest across the channel in England. (The English and the Irish are involved in some nasty territory battles, so Sorcha is not exactly well-liked over there.) Her warden is Lord Hugh of Harrowfield, who has good reason to believe Sorcha has information about his missing brother.<br />While not everyone lives happily ever after (this is the first part of a trilogy, after all), most of the fairy tale remains intact. Each of the six brothers is a separate character, albeit some more fleshed out than others. I actually had more sympathy sometimes with Finbar or Conor than with Sorcha herself, who grows more and more removed from the world around and thus starts to become a little inaccessable to the reader, as well. Full of Celtic lore, with romance, magic, intrigue, danger, and sacrifice, this is a well written, beautiful story.	2004-01-08

As for Sorcha's six brothers, only two remain with her - Liam is Lord of Sevenwaters, and Conor is the chief Druid nearby. Padriac has become an explorer who makes a brief appearance, as does Finbar, who was the one brother left with a swan's wing after their stepmother's curse was lifted. Diarmid and Cormack have died in battle - an unsatisfactory ending, I thought, to two characters who bore such import in the first book. <br />This book focuses again on the youngest daughter, Liadan, who is kidnapped by a band of outlaw mercenaries to heal one of their members. She then has to decide whether her loyalty belongs with her family, or with the tragic heroes of the outlaws, all of whom are more noble than many of the other allies of Sevenwaters. In particular, Liadan is drawn to the enigmatic chief of the band, whom she dubs Bran and who plays the whole &quot;I hate you/I love you/Get the hell away from me&quot; repetoire repeatedly. Bran's secret past figures prominently, as do the alliances between Sevenwaters and the nearby clans in trying to drive out the British invaders.<br />This story isn't based on an existing fairy tale (that I know of) the way &quot;Daughter&quot; was, which allows the author more freedom but leaves those of us who like the adult fairy tale genre a bit out in the cold. In treating her characters from the first book so cavalierly, Marillier has cut us off a lot from what we liked about &quot;Daughter&quot;; indeed the tone of &quot;Son&quot; is often very different, less mystic and magical, more immediate and grounded in reality.<br />Fans of the first book could easily stop there, where the fairy tale ends. Still, it's worth it to continue - &quot;Son&quot; remains a well-written and lovely book in its own right and a worthy heir to the series.	2004-01-08

Fainne has been tutored by her father and grandmother in the arts of sorcery, and is sent to Sevenwaters to sabotage the Irish plan to take back the all-important Islands from the British. If you skipped a lot of the battle and strategy talk in the first two books, like I did, you might want to review them first, as they play a big role in the final 1/3 of this book.<br />As I said, Fainne is a completely different sort from her aunt Liadan and her grandmother Sorcha, and there were times I felt Marillier let her protaganist off too easily. As Oonagh's pawn, Fainne is coerced/blackmailed into doing some truly horrible things, and even though she doesn't technically do them of her own free will a bit more accountability seems to be in order.<br />I don't know why Marillier abandoned the references she included at the beginning of &quot;Son of the Shadows&quot;, if anything they would be more useful here. Two items I felt would be indispensable: a family tree (to sort out the confusion created by the relationship between Niamh and her uncle Ciaran, which makes Sorcha, for instance, both Fainne's grandmother and aunt) and a copy of the Prophecy, which plays such a huge role in the later part of the book but which isn't repeated anywhere until the book is almost over. <br />I couldn't relax as much with this book as much as I did with &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Son&quot;, which, despite the hardships faced by their main characters, had at least a few moments of love and beauty. There's none on display here, and the entire book feelstense and bleak because of it. So, while the writing remains as skillful as ever, I can't help but wish Marillier loved her characters as much as she makes her readers love them. While I have no objection to creating characters that are complex and have varied motives, abandoning beloved characters by the wayside just plain hurts. I wish I could give half-stars; &quot;Child&quot; deserves more than 3 but I just couldn't rate this one as high as the first two. Consider my rating a 3.5.	2004-01-08

Yes, each and every one of us has an umpteenth-great-grandmother profiled in this book - well, those of us of European descent, at least. Using mitochondrial DNA (a type of DNA that passes directly from mother to child), Sykes and his colleagues have determined that everyone alive today is descended from one woman, whom they have dubbed &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot;. Of her descendents, 7 are the ancestral mothers of everyone in Europe.<br />It's fascinating stuff (if you're into that sort of thing). The first part of the book gives us some background on what led Sykes to his conclusions, as well as a smattering of interesting history on genetic research in general. Sykes also gives us some applications of his discovery - determining who the Polynesians are descended from, or when the Native Americans made their trek across the Bering Strait, as well as his elaborate &quot;family tree&quot; which leads to the stories of the &quot;Seven Daughters of Eve&quot;. <br />My biggest criticism with this book is Sykes' treatment of the Daughters themselves. I think his first mistake was in naming them. Once he has attached names to them (thoroughly incongruous, modern names like Helena and Katrine), he wants to anthropomorphize them. Each Daughter has a chapter devoted to what her life would have been like - but Sykes oversteps the bounds of generalities and starts getting into specifics he could have no way of knowing. Instead of merely describing the flora and fauna of the period, the region, etc, Sykes attempts to give us the actual life stories of the women themselves. But if he makes up some of this stuff - like Ursula having twin daughters, or Jasmine inventing agriculture - how can we trust the rest of what he tells us?<br />Moreover, despite the fact that he goes out of his way to point out that there is nothing special about these women, his stories paint them all as the most beautiful, intelligent, and accomplished women in their tribes, who discover everything from the domestication of animals to the boat. By the end of the book, Sykes frequently devolves into mushy sentiment, waxing odes to his ancestress Tara, earnestly reminding us that &quot;this just proves how humanity is connected to each other.&quot; <BR> <BR>It's a tough line to walk between being informative and being entertaining. I guess I can't fault Sykes for erring on the side of entertainment, although a bit less melodrama would not have hurt him. Still, if you have any interest in the modern study and application of genetics, not to mention anthropology and genealogy, this book is a must-read.	2004-01-08

If, like me, your idea of great television is the Discovery or History channels, you'll love this book. I won't go so far as to say that Brown weaves together his fact and fiction \\"flawlessly\\", but he does it in the best interest of an entertaining read, and really, isn't that what we're here for?<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is a murder mystery whose clues all involve a secret society's beliefs about the Holy Grail. The plot is presented in \\"real time\\", with the more complicated explanations taking the form of flashbacks to the university classes taught by the main character, Robert Langdon. It was in these flashbacks that I felt the book bogged down the most, as the students' dialogue invariably consisted of the \\"3 Ws\\" - \\"Wow!\\", \\"Whoa!\\", and \\"Will this be on the test?\\" Their awe and ingenuousness at the neato-keeno things their professor is presenting is so unbelievable, especially for anyone familiar with real college students, that they jarred me away from the narrative.<br />Aside from that, expect to be surprised, shocked, and maybe even a little offended - but again, isn't that what we're here for? Brown has done his research, and whether or not you agree that his theories are correct or not, the fact is that there are some societies who believe in them. Learning about those theories alone made the book worth reading for me.<br />The plot itself is basic, a standard mystery/chase scene scenario that plays out across Europe. There are a few twists, but chances are pretty good you'll see them coming. The puzzles and cryptographs are witty, if inconsistent in their level of difficulty, and the characters are like milk - smooth, bland, and they go down fairly easily. The cookie is in the details and theories, and it's there that Brown has spent his time. Readers, you need the milk, but you're really there for the cookie. Swallow it down, you won't be disappointed.	2003-06-07

Unfortunately, she usually has a very interesting story to tell - she's just not very good at telling it.  Her characters all tend to be the same, the dialogue and mental asides are often dreadful, and her sentences are cliched and weak.<BR>Nowhere is this more apparent than in the three books in the \\"Free Bards\\" series. Reading it, I often find myself actually wincing as Lackey repeats these literary offenses, over and over and over.  By the 50th time one character completes another's sentence, accompanied by the sort of triumphant italics and exclamation points you usually only see in a 15-year-old's email, pointing out obvious points that the reader has already grasped three paragraphs ago, you'll be wincing, too.  All too often, Lackey is overly impressed by her own cleverness, and she never lets pass an opportunity for a character to grasp some plot \\"intricacy\\" (it's usually anything but intricate) with glee and proceed to explain it, point by soporific point, to the other characters. Given that all the characters fall into exactly two personality groups - the good guys, typified by their wide-eyed enthusiasm, goody-goodiness, and the fact that they all like each other, and the bad guys, who are cruel without any motive, and would be sneaky if the plot were complex enough - the reason for these explanations is somewhat obscure. <BR>Well, the plot, such as it is, of \\"Lark and the Wren\\", starts off well enough, with Rune, a provincial village girl who only wants to be a musician.  She escapes her dull life and heads to the city, where she's aided by an improbable streak of good luck and sympathetic characters, until she's ready to try to join the Bardic Guild.<BR>From there the plot devolves. The trials of a young girl, who we can at least identify with, are suddenly overshadowed by Lackey's lecturing on the dangers of greed, organized religion, sexism, xenophobia, etc, etc, etc. The plot serves as nothing more than a device to move Rune and her friends from place to place where they can be persecuted by the bad guys and/or meet more of the same good guys and/or save the world. The side-plots, rather than fleshing the story out, seem tacked-on, with no real bearing on anything. The characters are unbelievably boring, once you've met Rune, they're all exactly like her. Lackey's use of musical terms, again, is an effort to impress us with her own knowledge.  And, if I see one more internalized monologue, I'm going to scream.<BR>Read it if you must, as a Lackey fan, or if you can't pass up a book about musicians.  But if good writing is at all important to you, save your teeth from the inevitable grinding that will accompany this one.	2003-02-17
US	50387488	R9QEPLBO3T3C4	038550098X	591346591	Last of the Amazons: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Epic battles and heroic women	Not having read any of Pressfield's previous books, I picked this one for its title and subject matter alone.  In that respect, I was not disappointed.  Selene, Antiope, and Eleuthera form a &quot;trikona&quot; of fascinating characters: One, an exile who sacrificed her honor to save the hope of her people, one a queen who abandoned her people's way of life out of love for Theseus, and the last the lover of both these women, the greatest war leader of the Amazons, who led an assault on Athens that nearly succeeded in destroying the city.<BR>If the story suffers, it is due to the disjointed nature of the narrative, which skips from future to past to present and between points of view in haphazard fashion. In addition, Pressfield sometimes paints himself into a corner in his depictions of the Amazons, or tal Kyrte, themselves. He tries to create a society entirely from scratch, and doesn't quite make it convincing. <BR>Nevertheless, Pressfield manages to make the reader empathize both with the &quot;savage&quot; Amazons and the &quot;civilized&quot; Atheniens, both of whom realize that only one of these ways of life will survive. The struggle between these ways of life is heartbreaking and epic in scale, and at the end you can't help but mourn what was lost.<BR>Excellent reading for anyone interested in ancient Greece or women warriors.	2003-02-15
US	50387488	R2G6Q65ZPU5M3T	0553573985	626236404	Gibbon's Decline and Fall	Books	3	7	10	N	Y	You might like it, but can you forgive yourself?	I liked this book, but it made me uncomfortable that I liked it. For one thing, it is so rabidly anti-male that it's guaranteed to offend anyone with a Y chromosome, and plenty of people without one. For another, it's also anti-Christian and anti-Muslim, with plenty of jabs and barbs tossed at assorted other groups. (For the record, I'm a pagan, a feminist, and bisexual, so this doesn't have anything to do with my being personally offended or having my preconceptions shaken.)<BR>That said, Tepper's novel does offer up some intriguing ideas and theories, albeit ones so far-fetched it's difficult to see how we can apply them to our current culture. Her first mistake, I think, was setting the book in such a near future - written in 1996 and set in 2000, it's impossible to believe that society could ever have deteriorated so drastically in 4 years, much less that this could be set in any plausible near future. <BR>Anyway, the story starts with 7 women attending college in the 50's. They are unlikely friends (so unlikely, in fact, that it's sometimes hard to understand why they're friends at all, but whatever) who make a vow to each other: each will find a pinnacle in her life to stand on, never to decline or fall from that place. Well, fast forward 40 years - Carolyn is a retired lawyer, married to one of the few \\"good\\" men in the story. Faye is a militant lesbian and a sculpter. Agnes is a nun, Jessamine a zoologist, Ophelia a doctor, Bettiann a trophy wife, and Sophy, well Sophy's dead - at least they think so. The mysterious girl whose goal in life was to figure out why women are so oppressed has mysteriously disappeared, although her voice still visits the six remaining friends. Meanwhile, society has gone down the aforementioned tubes. Women's colleges are being bombed, men are lashing women in the street, and the misogynistic Alliance is gaining political power, both in the US and internationally. Women, basically, are screwed. Then Carolyn is asked to defend a young girl who threw her newborn into a dumpster, and it all comes together.<BR>Did I mention that I have a hard time with a book that completely excuses infanticide? I know the point Tepper was trying to make (that women are more than walking wombs), but doing it by having all her protaganists repeatedly explain why it was perfectly OK for this young mother to kill her baby is unsettling, to say the least. <BR>That said, the scenario Tepper paints is interesting, if for nothing else in a sort of horror-chills sort of way. Sophy's origins, when they are revealed, are a stretch, but original, and bring the story back to it's fantasy roots. If you can wince your way past the worst of the male-bashing, and suspend your disbelief through most of Tepper's fanciful paranoia, you might even enjoy it - but your conscience won't.	2003-01-03
US	50387488	R3RYONXBBCNB70	0670894494	939558795	The Passion of Artemisia	Books	2	8	9	N	Y	Renn Faire treatment for a woman who deserves the real thing	10 to 1 you've never even heard of Artemesia Gentileschi (I hadn't), the female Renaissance painter. Regrettably, after reading Susan Vreeland's novel/biography, you're probably not going to be any more knowledgable.<br />The best historical novels give you a good grasp of both the differences and the similarities of the situations people faced back then. Artemesia's world, however, is more like a Renn faire than the actual Renaissance - a thin veneer of quaint history, overshadowed by an effort to make Artemesia a thoroughly modern, feminist heroine. Unfortunately, this effectively trivializes the struggles she faces as a female artist in a decidedly misogynistic time. After a promising first chapter, in which she is tortured and villainized at the trial of her former teacher and rapist, the omnipresent Church seems to disappear. At one point, Artemesia even blithely asserts that she sees the Bible merely as a source of good stories, a view that I would think any reasonably sensible Renaissance woman, much less one who's already found herself on the wrong side of the Inquisition, would be a little more discreet about disclosing. Her truly monumental achievement, becoming the first woman admitted to the Accademia dell'Arte in Florence, is likewise glossed over and eventually forgotten, as she leaves her husband and moves to Genoa with her young daughter. Meanwhile, the few tantalizing hints that are dropped never materialize into anything, like the prospect of an affair with Galileo himself.<br />In fact, Vreeland's story is more about a young working mother obsessed with her career than about art, the Italian Renaissance, or female artists. In trying to make Artemesia a character modern readers can empathize with, she's turned a woman who was surely fascinating and complex into someone whose story we've all heard before.	2003-01-03
US	50387488	RCW9Y6PNGH65X	0441008216	250670386	Heart of Gold	Books	2	5	5	N	N	Shinn spreads herself too thin here	This semi-fantasy novel has a lot of lofty ambition. Unfortunately, it falls short of just about every goal it sets for itself, save only as a good story. If it didn't try so darn hard, you wouldn't even notice its shortcomings, however, like the novels of Sheri Tepper, you can't separate this book from it socio-political preaching.<BR>Race and gender are the two big hot-buttons here, with bio-warfare and terrorism as sidekicks, as Shinn gives us a dualistic world where the two major races are the matriarchal indigo and the second-class patriarchal gulden. The indigo are basically Victorian England with a gender reversal, while the gulden seemed to represent (despite the more obvious racial parallel to blacks) a sort of Arab-Muslim society that we're not supposed to approve of. (This comparison is only more striking since there's a land struggle that parallels the Isreali-Palestinian conflict, with the gulden participating in the more conventional bombing-style terrorism.) Despite the fact that this books is about a \\"forbidden love\\" and \\"two races\\", both protaganists are indigo - one, a male scientist starting to squirm at the thought of marrying his rich fiancee and giving up his career to become a good househusband, the other, a high-caste heiress who's spent most of her childhood among the gulden and who is the lover of the gulden's most notorious terrorist/hero. When Nolan, the scientist, uncovers a plot against the gulden, he kidnaps Kit, the heiress, and uses her to get into gulden society so he can warn them.<BR>Aww, how altruistic. I can't even count the number of times Nolan \\"stubbornly\\" asserts, \\"It's the right thing to do,\\" when both gulden and indigo alike stare in disbelief and say, \\"I wouldn't have done it.\\" Neither side of this conflict comes out particularly attractive: the gulden are ruthless and opportunistic, the indigo are condescending snobs.<BR>And what the heck is the point of giving us a matriarchal society when you don't do anything with it?OK, I can accept not wanting to just give us the \\"women in charge would mean Utopia\\" line. But you'd think that it would mean a few differences. Instead, again, the indigo are nothing more than the Victorians. Worse, the women in power manage to combine the worst aspects of both men and women of that era - patronizing, scheming, and class-obsessed, but also flighty, shallow, and more concerned with social events than politics.<BR>The main trouble with this book remains that it tries to be too many things and ends up not being enough of any of them. A good story, marred by boring characters, an unconvincing romance, and a hard-to-swallow premise.	2003-01-03
US	50387488	R11EG8CKZSXIIQ	0345448987	737112991	Regina's Song	Books	3	6	11	N	N	A step down for Eddings, but still a fun read	Like many, I have a hard time reviewing this book without bringing in all of the Eddings' previous works as well. It's their own fault - recently, they have taken self-plagiarization to new, almost embarassing heights. It's a shame, because I can't help but believe that there are still plenty of great, original ideas in there. But the man is 72 years old, for crying out loud. Someone suggested that the fault lies with Leigh, David' wife and co-author. I see it differently - I can imagine her desperately trying to pull some of his old wit and sharp writing out of him, and getting pulled back again and again to the old stock characters and lame catch phrases. Maybe she's just as frustrated as we are.<BR>I agree with the review that said this book is a novella that's been stretched out to 400 pages. You could easily cut this book in half without losing anything. Much more needs to be said about the twins' childhood, much less about Mark's classes and his roommates. Ironically, one character's observation about the local police chief - he does things backwards, picking a suspect and then working the evidence to implicate them - could apply to Eddings as well. He's come up with a set of plot devices, and he's willing to twist every scenario around until it fits his preconceived notion of how the book should come out.<BR>Some questions (Semi-spoilers ahead): What psychiatrist in his right mind would let a patient as disturbed as Renata to not only leave the hospital, but move an hour away to live with a relative who habitually doses her with dangerous barbituates anytime she gets out of control? What English professor worth his diploma would think Renata's writing worth even a B, let alone the accolades that are heaped onto her essays? What D.A. would sit on his hands during an entire trial, and not cross-examine a single witness? Why on earth were all six roommates called to testify? Why does every character have the same, pseudo-\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" speech pattern? Why was it so important that they get Renata/Regina to that convent? What was wrong with the mental institution she had already spent several years in? Either Eddings needed to explain that one further, or he needed to cut that entire, ridiculous \\"Mission Impossible\\" chapter at the end.<BR>But.... but but but. I love Eddings, truly I do. And you have to admit it's an intriguing idea, in a Lifetime movie sort of way. They could have gone further in making Renata's victims villainous, if they really wanted us to sympathize with her, but they get the point across. <BR>So, three stars. From a lesser author, it might be worth more, but expectations are so high for anything with an Eddings byline that I just couldn't help being disappointed. It's easy reading, and if you can suspend your disbelief for a few hours it's even kind of fun.	2002-12-26

Phedre no Delaunay may be the most unique and interesting heroine ever written. Masochist, bisexual, prostitute, spy, prisoner, ambassador... she is all of these and more. <BR>Phedre's world shares our own history right up until the death of Jesus, when Jesus's blood, mingled with the tears of Mary Magdalene and the soil of Mother Earth, gives birth to a new savior, Elua. Together with his seven chosen angelic companions (including Naamah, who prostitutes herself to save him, and Kushiel, a former punisher of sinners) found the kingdom of Terre d'Ange, mingling their immortal blood with humans according to Elua's decree: \\"Love as thou wilt.\\" A beautiful philosophy, and one that creates a land where sexuality in all its forms is holy, natural, and accepted. I found the d'Angeline religion fascinating, and a lovely backdrop for Phedre, who serves Naamah but has been chosen by Kushiel to find pleasure in pain. The first \\"anguissette\\" in three generations, she finds herself first a pawn and then a player in a deadly game of court intrigue. <BR>The book is almost divided in half. The first, \\"pawn\\" half, focuses more on Phedre's education, both sensual and intellectual. Her teacher, Anafiel Delaunay, uses her as a spy, for reasons he won't entirely reveal to her. There are some graphically erotic scenes with Phedre's patrons, and whispers and intimations of plots and intrigues both past and present.<BR>By the second half, Phedre is on her own, and must use what she's learned as she is cast out of home and country, first as a prisoner to the barbaric Skaldi (Norseman/Viking/Goth counterparts), then as an ambassador to the Albans and Cruithne (Celtic counterparts). This is where her personality finally takes shape, and although, as she laments, Kushiel's Dart never stops pricking, she uses her bedroom skills shrewdly and for a greater purpose. <BR>Erotic, imaginative, lushly beautiful, intelligent... all these things and more describe both Phedre and this book. The villainess is seductive, the good guys are all too human, and everyone in between has their own motivations. With both a rousing climax (no pun intended) and enough strings left tantalizingly loose to make you eager for the sequel, it balances perfectly the edge between \\"good enough on its own\\" and \\"set-up for the rest of the series\\". Highly recommended!	2002-03-09
