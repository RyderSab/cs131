At first it seems a fantastic gift, but it is one that he finds soon enough comes with both an emotional and physical price. <br /> <br />This novel is very evocative of the time and places the stories within in it take place.  It is in some ways like a linked chain of short stories moving from the 1930's to the 1980's.   <br /> <br />While aimed at teen readers, this novel would be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a dash of the fantastic in their stories and well drawn characters.  To top it off the fade itself is somewhat creepy and the author makes it clear what a two edged sword such an ability might be. <br />	2005-10-07

Shortly after that she managed to get onto a flight to Dushanabe in Tajikistan and then through the border to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in Khoja Bahauddin with a pile of other journalists just prior to the American invasion of the country in 2001. <br /> <br />This memoir explores the every day life and challenges of living in Afghanistan - a country and society so different from the west in many ways that it might be on another planet.  Irris's view of Afghanistan was different from what many of her colleagues in the press saw simply because of her sex.  Even so, meeting the local women did not turn out to be easy.   <br /> <br />This is an interesting account of life in a war zone. It makes you realise how ill a society can get when there is so little interaction between men and women and how sometimes the \\"good guys\\" can be just as bad as \\"the bad guys\\".  It also makes me very glad I don't live in Afghanistan.  However what was amazing was  how even when they hit rock bottom some of the \\"ordinary\\" people of the region can be extraordinary and generous to people they barely know - this book is a full kaleidoscope of the light and dark of human nature in an easy to read and natural style of writing. <br />	2005-10-02

However, this particular title has been getting a good word on the grapevine so I decided to give it a go and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br />Joanne Walker is by profession a police mechanic.  She loves her cars, and considers herself \\"normal\\", so nobody is more surprised than her when she finds she is actually a potent shaman with only three days to prevent the Wild Hunt being set loose on the world forever. <br /> <br />This book turned out to be a fast paced novel of action and discovery.  It's filled with a supporting cast of interesting and unusual characters and the book has no substantial romantic plot to it.  This novel would most closely compare to the Weather Warden series of books by Rachel Caine but out of the two series, I would have to say enjoyed this novel more as overall Joanne Walker is a more \\"human\\" and vulnerable character despite her rather awesome powers as she battles sleep deprivation and jet lag throughout this story.  I'm looking forward to the next book in this series which I admit I hadn't thought I'd say for a LUNA book. <br />	2005-09-29

Books	4	11	11	N	N	How to make fools out of every Intelligence service	Miles Kendig is a retired CIA spy who is dying slowly of boredom.  Unable to adjust to his forced retirement after a life living on the edge, he is inspired after a meeting with an old adversary to write his memoirs.  That is the last thing his former employers had counted on because Miles knows a lot more about their dirty tricks than they ever imagined - and he knows how to run circles around his hunters when he invites them to try and stop him. <br /> <br />This book was written in the 70s during the cold war and was later made into an entertaining movie. Despite the age, the story has held up well.  Kendig is not James Bond, but he's not stupid either as he takes both the CIA, KGB and MI5 on a merry chase.  This book held me easily to the end of the story, though its not quite the same as movie it easy to see its source in this book. <br />	2005-09-23

Having recently read this author's other book on the year 1000 I was interested to read how much had changed in the years since.  One thing that stands out is the sheer volume of information available for 1215 as opposed to the year 1000.  Prior to this I had never thought the early middle ages as well documented, but by comparison to earlier centuries there is an amazing wealth of documention still available. <br /> <br />This book clearly outlines the massive changes in society that took place in England in those centuries and the gradual accumulation of wealth in society.  It also gives a clear outline why King John was seen as \\"bad\\" and how the Magna Carta was the result of discontent and bad management on the King's behalf. <br /> <br />Issues around misconceptions that have built up about this document over the centuries are also addressed.  By the end of the book you feel you have a good outline of what it might have been like to live in those times and an appreciation for how seemingly small events can snowball into to larger ones that can affect us all.   <br /> <br />This is a highly reccomended book for history lovers, that is presented in plain english and easy to read format.  Its not aimed towards academics, but rather the general reader and you don't need to know anything about this era before you start this book. <br />	2005-09-12

However, this would have to be the most disappointing book in this series to date.  John indulges in some time travel to find out the secrets of the Nightside's beginnings and how he can prevent future catastrophe taking place. <br /> <br />This book neatly wraps up a lot of loose ends in the series to this point - however, its also very much like reading similar plots in the author's Deathstalker series, and doesn't add a lot of forward momentum to the series overall. This book is more of a place-marker in the series rather than the resolution of an interesting mystery and not one I would bother reading again. <br />	2005-08-30

She's a Weather Warden and one of the scarce people who stops Earth's weather killing all the human race as a day-to-day job.  However, she's also killed another well known Warden and can't explain to those chasing her why she did it, or they'd kill her as well. <br /> <br />This was an enjoyable chase novel, that will invariably be compared in some regards to Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden series. However, the overall effect is different - Joanne for all her powers is more \\"normal\\" than Harry as she battles with her need to survive and not succumb to the evil which is following her.  Its also a light romance story.  The ending is a good hook into book 2of this series, HEAT STROKE. <br />	2005-08-22

Translated from an original French novel the language in this English version is clear and flows well and drags you along easily from chapter to chapter. <br /> <br />Francoise D'Aubigne was born in jail to a family of well to do origins, but her parents were habitues of jail and poverty and she saw some of the worst of humanity before she even hit her teens. That she survived her childhood is amazing enough in itself. <br /> <br />This is the story of her gradual rise through French society of the late 17th century and her eventual secret marriage to the King. A most unlikely couple was never imagined, especially when you read about Francoise's beginings. <br /> <br />The author has bsed this novel on the many letters left behind by Francoise, and it shows a depth of knowledge rarely found, but often sought, in a well written historical story.   <br /> <br />As the Marquie de Maintenon Francoise has not left the best reputation in history and is often described as a religious bigot and has taken most of the blame for King Louis later religious reforms.  This novel gives you a facinating look at person trying to preserve personal worth in what she sees as a sea of sin and temptation - and trying to improve herself, and the people around her, in the only ways she knows how.  I'm not sure I'll ever look at the Marquise de Maintenon the same way again, and I'm happy to have read this excellent novel.   <br /> <br />(Annotated at the end with historical facts on a chapter by chapter basis no less)	2005-08-10

However, despite this, Jack remains one of the more interesting characters to have emerged in the supernatural-mystery genre an it'll be interesting to see what happens in the next volume in this series. <br />	2005-08-02

This is an outstanding work of Romanesque art with a variety of full page miniatures all enhanced with liberal amounts of gold and silver leaf. <br /> <br />The original book is in excellent condition and currently resides in the Getty Museum.   This small book on the manuscript takes you through the history of the missal, and illustrates all the main carpet pages of the book with most of the images in colour.  It is not a full reproduction of the manuscript but it is enough to let you know that you are looking at an extraordinary book that has survived in remarkable condition and this is probably the closest most of us will ever get to such a lovely early manuscript like this.  <br /> <br />Recommended if you want to know more about Romanesque illuminated manuscripts (they are very different from the later medieval books) or to get an insight into a book which is rarely otherwise seen in art and illumination books. <br />	2005-07-31

The format of the book is based on a calendar from the year 1000.  It takes us through each month of the year, and what a person living in the last days of Anglo-Saxon england (before the Norman invasion of 1066) might expect out of life. <br /> <br />I was surprised at both how different and similar things were a thousand years ago.  It burst some misconceptions I had about people living during what many saw as the-end-of-times. <br /> <br />This book is aimed at the general reader, not academics and gives a good overview of a long lost age. <br />	2005-07-20

Tavi is now a trainee Cursor at the academy in the capital and still has no furies to call his own.  However, when the First Lord collapses one evening while alone with Tavi it is up to him to decide the best way to prevent this sudden health problem from plunging Alera into civil war.  At the same time those in the Calderon Valley discover that the Wax Forrest has spawned a new evil that makes the previous wars in the valley look like child's play and could destroy all of Alera. <br /> <br />This story is played out in the space of a few days as Tavi tries to balance final exams with impending invasion and the political games of the high lords.  Tavi is growing up and this comes through clearly in this novel, and though it was somewhat disappointing to find him still fury-less, Tavi still manages to do more with his brains than many powerful people with furies ever achieve.  It will be interesting to see what happens in the next volume of this series, though its clear that without furies Tavi's options are becoming more limited, still, this is a series I will continue to be happy to buy in hardback. <br />	2005-07-20

As the troop heads south on their new mission to see the King we find out both Rabbit and his troop are in many cases much more than they seem. That their \\"backwoods\\" posting has more importance than even they imagined.      Rabbit is an unassuming character who is extremely likeable.  He keeps dragging you back into the narrative of this novel as relevations and surprises mount at steady intervals.  Some of the secondary characters were slightly less developed than I would have liked, but this is still a long book and only the first in a series.  Lorna Freeman and her Borderlands series is one I will now be keeping my eyes open for any new titles. Lets hope they are as good as this book, which once started I couldn't put down.	2005-07-16

Halley is the governor of a remote human run space station under siege - held hostage to alien space ships who have blockaded them for the last six months and shoot down anybody who attempts to escape the station. <br /> <br />In the midst of dealing with equipment breakdowns, alien politics and a chronic shortage of most the things needed to keep the station running, a ship from 95 years in the past suddenly and improbably appears in their space badly damaged.  The ship has three survivors who tell a strange story of a secret flight from Earth with alien help.  Then a legendary alien killing machine appears on station and all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br />This is book full of realistic characters.  People who get tired, make mistakes and have limitations.  There are no superheroes here, be they human or alien. This is essentially a mystery novel, but it one that leaves an impression of a future that while technologically advanced is still inhabited by human beings with the same frailties as those we meet everyday.  I'm looking forward to reading the sequel to this book TIME PAST and am only sorry I didn't find this book when it was first published. <br />	2005-07-07

Jack is hired by a medical researcher to investigate her bosses apparent links to a known underworld figure, convinced that her boss is somehow being blackmailed.  At the same time he is also hired by another man who is determined to get bloody revenge on the same underworld figure. <br /> <br />Before the story is over Jack will find Berzerk has a closer acquaintance to both his clients and his adventures in THE TOMB than he would have wished.  This novel is more uneven in pace than the previous books, but it winds together to a good conclusion.  The weirdness of The Otherness also rears its ugly head as Jack is baffled as to how he keeps running into its influence. <br /> <br />The Otherness gives these books a slightly X Files flavour, but Jack is such an engaging character that I'm still looking forward to the next book in this series. <br />	2005-06-23

The lands of Man he finds are lands of war, and in social processes have no advantage over that of the Trolls. <br /> <br />Although I liked Maggot and found him an intelligent character, in the end this book did not really appeal to me.  Too derivative in some ways of the old Noble Savage ideas.  While it is true that many hunter gatherer societies are often more truly  democratic than our own, an empire with its attendant beaucracy is not always inherently an evil thing either - and this book seems to play heavily to those themes. I liked the ending to this novel, but I know its not a book I'd read again. <br />	2005-06-22

Then one weekend while all the rest of her family are away, she does transition - into a strong and dangerous power and has to learn how to use it quickly before she harms those she loves. <br /> <br />This is a rather simple story plot-wise - but for me, the major disappointment is in the writing. The characters seemed flat with no great depth to them.  The LaZelle family seemed very insular, and their connections to other magical folk, or even society in general seemed poorly explained.  This novel reads like it was written for younger readers, and even Gypsum seemed to act younger than her supposed age of 20.  This is not a book I'd read twice. <br />	2005-06-12

This is a fascinating book, that should be read by anyone in interested in management, which shows how the company grew from a merger of two natural gas pipeline companies to become one of the largest energy traders in the country.    However, it was all built on shaky foundations. Enron comes across as a horrible place to work. A company where team building had no worth and only the \\"deal makers\\" and top management, who were perceived as making money got to share in the wealth the company was apparently generating.    In the end Enron's deceptive accounting was revealed and the true incompetence and thievery of its management ranks were exposed.  However, for 15 years the company managed to bluff the business community that \\"all was fine\\" and they \\"were the best\\" and almost everyone believed them, including people like their auditors at Arthur Anderson, who should have known better.  This book is a real eye-opener on all the things you SHOULDN'T do in business and how easily people and organisations can be corrupted by large amounts of money if there are no real controls over the people at the top of the company.  This is a true cautionary tale for modern times that is still relevant - especially if you work in a big organisation where things can be so easily hid.	2005-06-07

Harry is starting to get weighed down by the things he's done in the past, but the series continues to have a good cast of characters who all have a life of their own and continue to grow and change, which stops these books getting stagnant. <br /> <br />I continue to look forward to new novels in this series, and as usual, enjoyed this new outing, and its good to see that the author has finally graduated to hardcover with this novel.

It's a house which for the client contains nothing but bad memories but she refuses to give it up to the brother she despises.  However, other people are prepared to kill for the secrets the house holds - and it may well be that if Jack doesn't find out what those secrets are he could be dead too. <br /> <br />This novel is more of a thriller than Sci-Fi or horror, and I found that rather refreshing as you don't have to have read THE TOMB to really enjoy this book and the plot isn't dependant on knowing the contents of the previous novel in the series. <br /> <br />This is a series that so far I'm really enjoying.  Jack is a refreshing, complicated, but intelligent character whose stories combine the horror, thriller and slightly X-Files genres. <br />	2005-05-31

However, Jack is about to find it links in a totally unexpected way to another case of a missing necklace that he is also investigating. <br /> <br />This is a classic thriller-horror novel, and would be enjoyed by anyone who likes those genres. Its also the first book in the Repairman Jack series by this author.   Even though this was written in the 1980's its still a good read today, although it has to be said there's no \\"tomb\\" in this book, as that was a title imposed upon the author by his publishers apparently. <br /> <br />	2005-05-27

It looks like a fairly straight forward job but as soon as he gets on board things started to go wrong and one murder later he was sure that at least one of his new crew was not what they seemed. <br /> <br />This novel is set in a rather sleazy galaxy where all the interstellar shipping has gradually being bought under the control of a species who had developed an efficient and inexpensive stardrive putting people like McKell out of a job and onto the fringes of society. <br /> <br />If you don't like mystery novels you'll probably hate this book, but it is a well thought out chase and deception story which leaves its real revelations to the last chapters.

This novel is a gem.  It's a letter novel, a mystery and a comedy of manners.  I'm looking forward to meeting all these characters again in THE GRAND TOUR.

Humanity has been fighting the war against The Enemy for centuries, and humanity is on the verge of defeat, though most people don't seem to realise it.  Soldier M Jela is stranded on a desert planet when he finds the last seedling of a Tree race which had managed to hold the enemy at bay from their world for centuries. <br /> <br />Taking the seedling with him when rescued Jela meets smuggler Cantra at a chance meeting at a remote starport which will change both their lives forever.  This novel brings us back to the distant past and the beginnings of Clan Korval and the Liaden Universe and the story of the Great Migration and escape from the enemy and human genocide. <br /> <br />Keeping in mind that this is only half a story - to be completed with CRYSTAL DRAGON - this is an enjoyable novel in a past that is quite different what many later Liadens would believe. Pervaded with a subtle sense of doom, these novels will give the entire Liaden series a foundation that it currently lacks - I'm looking forward to book 2 and will be interested to see how well it meshes with the story of Jela and Cantra as related in PLAN B. <br />	2005-05-10

This book describes the challenges of photographing these houses, both in Black and White and colour.  Photos that you take for granted have a lot more art and skill involved in producing them than is readily apparent - especially if you haven't tried to take these sort of photos yourself. ( I have, and they never look as good as what you see in this book) <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book and covers 25 houses. The photos are a mixture of black and white and colour. All pictures are beautiful and sharp and printed on high quality glossy art paper. The houses range from Castello di Guarene in Piedmont, Palazzo Albrizzi in Venice, Schloss Bruhl in Cologne, Chateau de Bussy-Rabutin in Burgundy, Hotel de Lauzun in Paris and Skoloster in Sweden as just an example of a few. <br /> <br />Some of the houses/castles covered in this book only have a few photos, while others are up to 4 or 5 pages long.  Sometimes you wish for colour pictures, but not all these photos were originally taken with colour film, and even when printed in black and white all these pictures are of excellent quality. The text for each house gives you some of the background history of it, but unfortunately doesn't tell you if the house is open to the public today - or even still intact with its contents (some of these photos are decades old) <br /> <br />Country Life magazine today continues its regular articles on the Country Houses of both the UK and Europe, and it is lovely to see the best of their archives being printed in these books.  The great Country Houses of Europe are one of the great wonders of the world and usually represent some to the best of preserved artistic endeavour over the centuries if you take your time to search them out.  This book stands out from the crowd for the unusual range of houses covered and as a snapshot of some of the more outstanding examples. <br />	2005-05-01

The revolution and the invasion of the Blight has come and gone and Tom is now together again with Elva.  He is also the sole recepient of the wisdom in the severed head of the seerer Eemur. The head is severed, but still strangely alive and able to see the present with a searing clarity which she passes onto Tom.    However, there is a new threat on the horizion that will make the revolution/invasion in book 2 look like a child's play-pen, and Tom is proably the only person who can pull all of Nulapeiron together to fight it before they loose their world to a galaxy spanning engulfing darkness.    This was a satisfying conclusion to this series.  It ties together the threads in books 1 & 2 and we finally get to see why the pilots story is so important to both Tom and his world and those fighting The Anomaly. All 3 books are told on a mythic scale of story-telling, but they do tend to fall into a bit of a noticable plot pattern at times. However, despite that I was egar to finish this series and was glad I read it.  A keeper to be re-read at another time in the future, and a sci-fi series that successfully combines myth with science.	2005-04-15

This instalment reads very much like a typical fantasy adventure novel played out by the dregs of society in the islands.  Blaze Halfbreed is the character who narrates this instalment of the series as what looks like a reasonably minor problem with magic and an escaped Princess escalates into something which may destroy all the Isles - if anyone with power will believe that the problem exists! <br /> <br />I have read this entire trilogy - available already in Australia - and I would have to say that the first book is in some ways the weakest in the series, relying as it does on extended action scenes in places. However, by book 2 you realise how important the events described here are.  They reverberate throughout the remaining 2 books in unexpected ways.   <br /> <br />All said, this is a refreshing and very original series that turned out to be much better than I expected and has become a \\"keeper\\" in my collection. Highly recommended to lovers of fantasy. <br /> <br />	2005-04-05

Queen Marie Antoinette was alleged to have bought a diamond necklace worth over 1.6 million franks and refused to pay for it, and had Cardinal Prince Rohan, a long time courtier out of favour, arrested for it along with his accomplices the Countess de la Motte-Valois and the famous mystic Count Cagliostro. <br /> <br />This book is a series of fascinating first person accounts of how the necklace swindle occurred and the trial that followed it.  Most of the people involved in the scandal wrote their memoirs and virtually all the court related documentation is still available in France in archives.  This book is a compilation of these memoirs and legal statements made by all the parties involved in this crime which opened the monarchy and France to the fury of the revolution. <br /> <br />The author does not impose her own interpretation of the events on the reader, but does provide explanations to the backgrounds of the people involved and the social and political niceties of the time that explain why people acted as they did. <br /> <br />This book is a lively account of this important French scandal that, because of the first person accounts, reads like a novel.  If the story wasn't true it would be hard to credit such a cast of interesting characters, with their extravagant and wildly different backgrounds, coming together like this to play a crucial role in the downfall of the French Monarchy.  Its also very interesting to compare this book to what is portrayed in the movie of the same name.  There are a number of very significant differences! <br /> <br />	2005-03-31

For the first 100 pages Lucrezia barely makes an impact on the story of Italian double-cross and politics that make up the family life of her youth.  Its not until her second marriage to Alfonso d'Aragona that we start to get any real feel for Lucrezia's own personality. <br /> <br />However, having said this, the author has done a lot of research into the Borgia family and Italian politics and society of the period and it shows in this book.  Sometimes so much so, that you feel overwhelmed by the detail and loose sight of Lucrezia herself.  I would give this book 3.5 stars if possible.  Its not terrible book, but not for the first time, I feel I'm reading another biography of Lucrezia that gets swamped in the plots of her father Pope Alexander and her <br />brother Cesare.	2005-03-27

However, I found this book hard going.  He successfully pervades his novel with a sense of gloom and doom - to such an extent that I found this rather depressing reading. <br /> <br />As usual he has produced a richly detailed world, and a quite large cast of characters.  Tad Williams novels are never short but this one, for me, seemed to go on forever, and towards the middle I found myself slowed to a crawl with reading it.  Although there are portions, such as the section that dealt with the emperor's new wife, that I found I would like to know the end of the story, overall this book is not engaging enough for me to want to buy a hardback of the second book in the series and left me feeling somewhat disappointed - though I do know of others who loved it. <br />	2005-03-14

However, things are about to change, as the plans others have patiently hatched through those years come to fruition and Matthew's years of hiding will come to an end.<br /><br />This novel brings all the strands of the previous 2 books together. We finally get to see more of the Orlock history and their motivations and how the old world came to an end.  Matthew will find himself forced into a decision between what is necessary and what right - with neither solution giving him an easy choice.<br /><br />I have enjoyed these three books and this bought this series to an enjoyable conclusion.  Matthew was never the charismatic world leader you find in many fantasy novels but this book brings to adulthood characters which started as little more than children in the first book and finishes the story on a reasonably satisfying note, although it did leave me with a sense of  a few closing scenes missing which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.	2005-03-11

The top layers are the home of a varied and wealthy aristocracy - all their whims either catered to by their advanced technology or the classes of the lower strata's in their domains. <br /> <br />Tom Corcorigan is the 14 year old son of a lower level market trader.  A person of no significance in their world till a fleeing, almost mythical, pilot gifts him with a data crystal that will quite literally change his life and fortune when he one days goes up-strata. <br /> <br />This novel presents a complex world where the ability to understand complex mathematical formula is highly prized and in conjunction with leaps in biological engineering is the basis of much of their advanced technology.  Tom's journey takes you through a world of striking poverty and wealthy extravagance and a world on the edge of revolution though many do not realise it. <br /> <br />I have to say I enjoyed this novel, even though I don't really understand all the concepts and jargon the author uses. By the end of the book I really felt for Tom and felt attached to him and I'm looking forward to book 2 in this trilogy very much. This novel is a bit more hard SF than I normally read but I'm glad I picked it up to read. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-10

For some reason, when it first came out it couldn't hold my interest. However, on a recent re-reading of the book I can see why so many people love it.  It's full of people of character, tragedy, wonder and ancient evil deeds and a detective story to boot.  It really is a fairy tale - a clever story that gradually winds to a wonderful happy ending. If you want something light, amusing and clever to read then this book fulfils all those needs easily and is a nice way to spend a day or two.	2005-03-01

For all that time Davy has worked for the NSA.  Davy has always believed that it would be impossible to hold him prisoner given his ability to teleport, however he is about to find out how horribly wrong he is when a totally ruthless, wealthy and influential group of people drug and kidnap him to find out his secrets. <br /> <br />Stranded in their cliff-top home, Davy's wife, Millie makes the startling discovery that she too can teleport - that it is something that can be learned by the brain if you do it often enough.  Millie is determined to get her husband back despite the seeming lack of clues, and much of this novel revolves around tracking down Davy and Davy doing his best to give as little information as possible to his captors, while seeming to co-operate. <br /> <br />Like all Steven Gould's work this novel is well plotted with a commonsense approach to problems.  However, this novel has not fallen into the trap of some of his previous books by being over descriptive of technical details.  Instead we have a very action based story that easily carries you to its end.  It's a great, and suspenseful, and at times cringe-worthy, follow up to JUMPER, and given its ending can easily support another novel in this series. (However, be warned, if you really dislike torture scenes avoid this book) <br />	2005-02-06

However, it is more than simply an exhibition catalogue, and in fact there isn't even a full listing in the book of the items that were on display.  However, what this book does do is explore the changes of costume in France and America that occurred during the years of Napoleon's rule in France from 1789 to 1815.<br /><br />The topics covered in the book include:-<br /><br />1. Costume in the age of Napoleon<br /><br />2. Jewels of the empire<br /><br />3. Joseph Cardinal Fesch and the liturgical vestments of Lyon<br /><br />4. Silk from Lyon during the empire<br /><br />5. Uniforms in the Napoleonic era<br /><br />6. The Emperor's wardrobe<br /><br />7. American women and French fashion.<br /><br />The book is beautifully illustrated throughout with colour pictures of costumes that were on display in the exhibition and by other supporting objects such as paintings and prints of the same era.  This is one of the few books that go into detail on the fashions of this period and deals with other related subjects such as Napoleons efforts to revitalise the silk and lace industries of France to be used in his court and the costumes of his armies.  Recommended for anyone interested in French fashions of this period, or even Regency fashion in general.	2005-01-26

Its hard to beat this book for sheer volume and breath of the type of Tudor portraits illustrated.  The book is divided into the following sections:-    1. Holbein and his predecessors  2. Edward VI, Mary I and Continental Art  3. Eworth and his contemporaries  4. Elizabeth 1  5. Elizabethan painters and patrons  6. The private image  7. The turn of the 16th century  8. The New Netherlanders    Virtually all the pictures are illustrated in colour with a listing giving biographical information about the sitter and the artist where it is known.  The back section of the book also includes a very interesting technical breakdown of methods used by the artists Bettes, Hilliard and Ketel in their works.  If you have any interest in the art of this period this is a book you should seriously consider tracking down.	2005-01-25

Thomas was then sent to the local San Pedro prison after almost being starved to death by the local police because he didn't have any cash on him to pay for food in their holding pens.   <br /> <br />San Pedro prison turned out to be the strangest place Thomas had ever been in his life.  It was a microcosm of the entire Bolivian economy.  People ran shops, made and traded drugs, bribed all the police and guards on a daily basis and had their wives and children live with them in jail. <br /> <br />Thomas is honest and straightforward in stating that before his arrest he was a professional drug smuggler and after his introduction to prison a regular cocaine taker as well.  He's not an angel, but this is a fascinating story of good times and bad times and the friends and enemies of life in the strangest prison you'll ever read about.  The moral of this story is - if you have to go to prison in South America make sure its San Pedro and that you are rich and any of other nationality aside from USA. \\"Gringos\\" can survive these prisons but they can also be brutal to people that they hate and this book shows you both the light and dark sides of San Pedro prison and a place that was at one point one of South America's strangest tourist attractions. <br />	2005-01-20

Her husband was the General of the Papal armies and a man of power during his fathers reign as Pope.  However, he was a less than ideal husband for Caterina and a violent ruler of his cities of Forli and Imola in the Italian region of Romagna.  <br /> <br />This novel is based on a true story.  Caterina was to lead a life of intrigue and violence. She was woman who was not afraid to lead armies if necessary and was admired by Machiavelli as wily ruler in her own right after her first husbands death.   <br /> <br />For a look at a remarkable woman who is mostly forgotten outside Italy today this novel is an eye opener on a period of very violent Italian history in the early Renaissance years.  Like all good historical novels at the end of it you want to know more about the \\"real\\" Caterina, though there is not much to find in English written histories.  Read this story for an insight into Italy in a time of marauding armies. <br />	2004-12-27

He has dug up records that have not been used by historians in over 100 years and for the first time fully reviewed all the original documents relating to the death of her husband Darnley and come up with some very interesting results.<br /><br />Mary comes across as an intelligent, well educated, politically astute woman when she finally took her place on the throne of Scotland.  It's often easy to overlook the fact that for close to 5 years she successfully ruled Scotland and its plotting Lords in her own name before the dramatic events which shaped her eventual fate took place.  John Guy successfully puts these years of successful rule in their place and presents a version of the death of her husband Darnley that makes a great deal of sense given the evidence of this event that is still preserved in English archives.<br /><br />Mary's later captive years are dealt with in less detail, but the plots that eventually bought about her death are presented in with insight and detail. This biography has a lot of new information on Mary, and if you are interested in this complex and tragic historical figure then this book is a must, and it will make you re-think some of the assumptions in earlier biographies.	2004-12-23

It deals not with the fans China made for the west (Mandarin fans and elaborate ivory brise fans), but with those that were made for local use and taste. <br /> <br />First we are given a history of Chinese fans dating back to prehistoric times, quoting numerous examples of ancient fans found in archaeological digs over the last 50-60 years. It also deals with the methods of making fans -both for sticks and leaves and how they have changed over the centuries.  There is also a section of painters noted for their fans whose work is highly esteemed within China.  This portion of the book, almost more than any other, gives a good feel for how knowledge the West lacks on native Chinese fans.  Many 'Great' artists and calligraphers are mentioned that have almost no references in Western art books on Chinese art.   <br /> <br />My only disappointment with this small volume is that many of the masterpieces mentioned in the text do not necessarily have corresponding photos. The author seems to assume that the reader would be familiar with these artists. While this may hold true in China this book almost breaks new ground in the west in dealing with Chinese fan painting and manufacturing in English.  This book should be part of any fan collectors reference works if you have an interest in Chinese fans. <br />	2004-12-04

This is an action-adventure fantasy novel that moves along at a brisk pace with a fairly wide cast of characters. <br /> <br />Jim Butcher has created an interesting world with this novel and it is obvious that most of the secrets of Tavi's family have yet to be explored, but thankfully there will be another book which may flesh out some of the lingering mysteries.   <br /> <br />My only slight disappointment is that Butcher succumbed to the fantasy clich of using an orphaned 15 year old boy as his central character - but that did not stop me actually liking Tavi.  On the whole I'm glad I've read this book and will be looking forward to book 2 when it is published. <br />	2004-11-05

This book reproduces the illuminated carpet pages from this manuscript along with an introduction to the history of the book and commenty on individual plates.  The plates themselves are very colourful and striking filled with vivid pinks, purples and greens.  There were two main artists who produced this book and their work is quite distinctive giving the second half of the book quite a different flavour from the first half. <br /> <br />My main complaints about this reproduction is that the gold ink that has been used to recreate the effect of gold leaf in the original book has somewhat obscured some of the detail in the facsimile plates, and that some of the edges of the pages appear to have been chopped off to forced into the current book size which gives the impression of the illuminations spilling off the page or amputated in some cases.   <br /> <br />However, these quibbles aside, this is a striking manuscript, well worthy of reproduction and every time you look at you are astonished at the brightness of the plates and the colours the artists selected.  They are very different from the books produced in France and England during the same period.  This book, in hardback, with a slipcase, is recommended to anybody who enjoys the striking beauty of medieval illuminated manuscripts. <br />	2004-10-09

This book reproduces 32 carpet and calendar pages from this original prayerbook in colour and gold ink.  This is a small size hardback book in a slipcase in line with the size of the original work it copies.   <br /> <br />The illuminations in this case prove to be particularly fine and include a full 12 month prayer calendar illuminated with the star signs and activities associated with that month and a selection of plates relating to the Hours Of The Virgin and other saints. <br /> <br />Each plate is accompanied by commentary explaining the story behind the painting.  In this case each page of the manuscript has been reproduced with fine quality images highlighted by delicate gold ink in such a way that it enhances the images (like it should) rather than detracting from them with a heavy application of ink. <br /> <br />This small book should be on the shopping list of anyone who has a love for illuminated manuscripts and miniature paintings.  It is currently a treasure of the National Gallery of Victoria in Australia, and this small, affordable reproduction makes a great selection of images from this prayerbook available to anyone who wishes to see them. <br />	2004-10-09

Its hard to believe its been 10 years since the first Nightfall book, however, after reading this one its also hard to believe that there will be any more novel length stories featuring this character.    This story starts a few weeks after the end of the first book when Nightfall (aka Sudian) is recovering from his injuries sustained in his fight against the sorcerer Gilleran.  Sudian is now Chancellor of Alyndar though in his ignorance of the nobility and its ways he is also dangerously lacking in knowledge of what that entails - and nobody seems to have been smart enough to enlighten him.    Shortly thereafter while in a neighbouring kingdom, while Sudian is away on an errand, King Edward is kidnapped with Sudian the only survivor of his entourage and the natural scapegoat for Edward's disappearance and the scene is set for the return of Nightfall.    I enjoyed this novel.  It is another story featuring the character Nightfall and in this book we get to know more about his way of life and various aliases before he met Edward, as Sudian/Nightfall combed the known world looking for him.      While maybe this book doesn't have quite the tension of the first novel, which had Nightfall's soul at stake throughout its length - this is still an enjoyable, light fantasy read and I was happy to return to the world of Nightfall if only for this last time, though it should be mentioned, as the kidnapped character Edward only has small, though vital, part in this story. I should also mention that it would be nice to get the first book in a hardback edition like this one as the original novel is starting to yellow pretty badly after all these years.	2004-10-09

This is a small book reproduces, in colour, a selection of the main carpet pages from the manuscript.  <br /> <br />Although not a full reproduction of the entire manuscript this is still a lovely book.  There is a series of well painted scenes from the bible and scriptures. Many of these are surrounded by an equally well painted border of flowers and insects and the beauties of nature.  At times its hard to know what to look at - the central picture or the intricate borders. <br /> <br />Interspaced between full page pictures the author Janet Blackhouse presents the reader with a short history of illuminated manuscripts in England and the lowlands and the people who were behind the production of this particular book.  This little book is highly recommended for lovers of illuminated manuscripts or those who enjoy Medieval art.  While not the last word on the Hastings Hours, it is still inspiring to browse through and enjoy these gems of the middle ages which rarely get seen in larger books on illuminated manuscripts. <br />	2004-10-08

It wasn't until I had started reading it that I realised that there is a prequel called THE DEATH OF THE NECROMANCER that features many of the characters prominently mentioned (but not actually there) in this story. <br /> <br />Tremaine is the daughter of Ile-Rien's greatest thief and spy.  She's also the owner of a sphere that was given to her as a child which may prove the last salvation of their people in the three year long war against the Gardier. This war and Tremaine's world of magic and technology give her home a feeling of either first or second world war London under siege.  Her people are on the verge of loosing everything to an enemy that they seem to have no defence against.   <br /> <br />As an introductory novel to a trilogy this is a good read.  It moves along at a fast pace and the final chapters bring unexpected knowledge to all the characters. I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in this series, THE SHIPS OF THE AIR. <br />	2004-10-05

This instalment in The Kingdoms Of Thorn And Bone is more choppy in pacing that the first book, and relies heavily on cliff-hanger chapter endings. However, these are only minor quibbles.  The story is making steady progress towards a climax and new characters are introduced who turn out to be of more importance than they first appear. <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see what the importance of a true Queen in Elsen turns out to be in book three, but this instalment is enough to make me buy that novel when it comes out as I want to know how this story finishes - this is written in the assumption that this is trilogy that we are reading here, and not a never ending story like The Wheel of Time. <br />	2004-09-25

The story moves along at a brisk pace with a steady character development for all the main players in the story with no noticeable slow patches in the plot pacing. <br /> <br />By ridding himself of the Drakhaon Gavril Nagarian appears to have gained personal freedom for himself. However, he has left his country fatally weakened to Prince Eugene's ambition.  Gavril and those he loves will pay a price higher than he ever imagined for his freedom from his daemon and by the end of this novel the whole world will stand on the brink of disaster as old secrets and their promise of power become unravelled. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to book 3 of this series, which I assume is the final volume.  It will be interesting to see how these storylines resolve as these characters grow on you as you are alternatively appreciative and appalled by their actions. <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

They are expendable because they are ugly or freaks.  I have to admit I had somewhat expected a comedy with this novel, and while it does raise the odd mild laugh in the end its not a really memorable novel or one that I really want to keep.   <br /> <br />Somehow Festina and her woes of being exiled fail to raise a great deal of tension. Her problems turn out to mostly reasonably easily solved and the book slides by like a bland desert.  I know that there are other books in this series, but I have to say that this first instalment does not make me inclined to seek them out.   <br />	2004-08-27

Hari Michelson aka Caine is now an upcaste, physically crippled administrator, who after a betrayal finds all he has worked for all his life stripped away from him.  His enemies think he is now of little threat - little do they know, that this is the catalyst that will bring Caine back to life in ways they could never have anticipated. <br /> <br />While this story could be read alone, you'll get the most out of it if you read it after the first book in this short series.  This novel is quite different in pacing and content than the previous book.  HEROES DIE is more of a straight adventure novel along the lines of a somewhat `traditional adventure' story.   BLADE OF TYSHALLE has this aspect, but we get to see more of Hari's caste ridden earth, as well as expanding on many themes only touched upon in the first book and some very interesting new characters are introduced.   <br /> <br />However, be warned there are some very graphic and violent scenes in here that may make you winch to read.  All told these two Caine stories easily stand out in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy crowd of novels for their richness of characters, fast movement and violence.  While normally gratuitous violence in a novel is a real turn off for me, in these books, it does in the end have a point and is not as gratuitous as it first seems.  I'm glad I stumbled across these books and this is an author whose work I will keep an eye out for in the future. <br />	2004-08-26

Hari Michaelson is an actor and a world-wide superstar.  In an alternative earth, known as the overworld, where magic works, he is also known as the assassin Caine where his \\"adventures\\" are eagerly watched by billions. When Hari's ex-wife, another actor, vanishes in the overworld Hari is drawn into saving her for what the studio on earth sees solely as another action-packed adventure, but for Hari it is much more importance than that.    This is both a brutal and brilliant novel.  You really shouldn't like Hari/Caine.  He's not a nice man by most accounts. He swears all the time (lots of the \\"f\\" word in this book), he'll kill you as soon as look at you and is outstandingly ruthless.  Despite all this, he is a compelling and complex character and this novel easily pulls you from chapter to chapter.    Both the overworld and earth society have been given a great deal of thought in this novel, and both are equally richly detailed to provide a combination of Sci-Fi and fantasy in the one book.  I hadn't expected this book to be so well written, based on the blurb on the back, and while I'm disgusted by some of the things Caine does, its also fascinating, a bit like watching a natural disaster on TV - and in effect that is what Caine is to the overworld as he keeps earth mesmerised as he navigates both the politics of home and the brutality of everyday life in the overworld.	2004-08-15

Thomas, vampire of the white court has helped Harry in the past and is now calling in his favours to get Harry to investigate a lethal case of evil eye happening on a friend's \\"adult\\" film set.  It seems a simple request - stop the hex and find the bad guys.   <br /> <br />Then the Black Court vampires hit town and start attempting to kill Harry - he's target no.1 and the vampire-wizard war is still on.  Like all the other books in this series, this is novel moves along at a quick pace with poor Harry getting bashed by one set of bad guys after another.  Harry also finds out family secrets from an unexpected source that will change his life, and the way he views the world forever. <br /> <br />These continue to be well written mystery-action and magic novels that build on one another. While this could be read alone, these books are best read in sequence as Harry's reactions make more sense when you understand the implications of his past cases.  I'm very much looking forward to the next book in this series. <br />	2004-08-13

James Green was an amateur anthropologist during his time in Burma and this collection of textiles was formed as part of \\"classifying\\" various ethnic groups in the region. <br /> <br />However, as this book points out, people migrate, \\"traditions\\" change and outside interpretations as to ethnic groups are not always accurate or even valid to those who are being classified. <br /> <br />The strength of this book is that it displays not only old textiles from the 19th and early 20th century but also new textiles from various regions.  The Green centre in Brighton has been carefully collecting new textiles from weavers so as to understand weaving methods, the use of the textile, its meaning and placement in social context.  This book is beautifully illustrated throughout in colour and has sections devoted to most of the major ethnic groups with a few of the textile types common to each illustrated.  It also has sections on Court Dress, textile texts (sazigyo) and the weavings done in refugee camps. <br /> <br />This book considers aspects of Burmese textiles and their makers that you won't find in many other places.  While not dense with text, it is still a good visual reference work and at the back includes a list of where Burmese textiles can be found in western collections. <br />	2004-08-06

After he is humiliated in front of a group of older magicians he decides to take revenge on the man who hurt him.  To do so, he conjures the Djinn Bartimaeus to steal an artefact called the Amulet of Samarkand, something he knows that his tormentor treasures. <br /> <br />What Nathaniel doesn't know about this amulet may just kill him and  Bartimaeus if they are not careful.   The story is told in two different strands from both Nathaniel's and Bartimaeus point of View. The djinn's version is very funny to read. This is a book that easily holds you to the end of the story.  Written for children, this is a book that can be enjoyed by all readers, though you should be warned there is some death involved, and Nathaniel isn't always the nicest person. However, he's a good foil the fun that Bartimaeus brings to the story.  I'm looking forward to the next book in this series when it is published. <br /> <br />	2004-07-26

What neither Scott or Halitov expected was to walk into a massacre caused by a traitor in the ranks of the Wardens.<br />This story is told in flashback and is the story of two traitors in Scott's life, one in the past, the other in the present.  It proves, if nothing else, that Scott has learnt from the horrors of his past.<br />These books are still entertaining, and it is interesting to see the emotional growth of Scott has he finally makes some permanent connections to other people.  We also see some of Scott's future and realise at last why it was so important for him to survive the war.  There's also a possible solution to his ageing and faulty conditioning problem.<br />However, having said all that, this does not conclude the colonial war story.  We don't see the end of the war or how Scott slipped into politics at its end.  This book could be read as the end of the story, but there's still plenty of scope and loose ends for another instalment of the story of Scott St Andrew.  I understand the author had plans to write 3 more books in this series to complete it, whether the publishers will ever give us those books is a different story.  Let's hope we do see them!	2004-07-10

For Scott, while he can appreciate their aims, this means betraying everything of moral importance to him.  This is basically a book of difficult choices.  We meet old characters from book 1 as well as some new important people as Scott shifts though a myriad of plots and betrayals.<br />Although the constant battle scenes can be wearying and somewhat depressing with all the loss in lives and how little they really achieve, this book rattles along at a fast pace and keeps you wanting to know how it ends.  I'll be very interested to see where this war takes St Andrew in book 3, PATRIOTS IN ARMS.	2004-07-09

When these photographs were taken Angkor was still a remote location visited by only a lucky few.  The main temple of Angkor wat was still unrestored and in quite a different state from what you see today.<br />The photos reproduced here are all of excellent quality  and large size. If you have visited the Angkor temples then this book is wonderful to browse through and compare to how different they are now that the temples have been restored and cleaned up (and swarming with tourists).  Even places like Ta Prohm which tourists like to think as still in pure jungle would be surprised at how much has actually changed from these photos.<br />If you have ever visited Angkor, or have any interest in the monuments then this book is one you should have a look at for its wonderful and rare images of a lost world.	2004-07-09

What he doesn't count on is war breaking out between earth and the colonies while he is still in his first year of training.  This forces his superiors to rush the students through a &quot;conditioning&quot; process which turns them into super-soldiers.<br />Unfortunately for Scott the process was bungled while he was going through it and much of this book explores the consequences of mistakes and explores themes of justice and loyalty.  This is an easy to read book and Scott is a likeable character.  Even, if like me, you aren't normally into military books this is still a good quick read that easily carries you through to the end of story.  I'm looking forward to reading book 2 in this series REBELS IN ARMS.	2004-07-06

I'm really looking forward to book 2 in this series and hope that it keeps to the same quality of this book. If it does then the author is giving authors like George RR Martin and Robert Jordan a run for their money in showing us a world that is either on the edge of destruction or renewal and is high fantasy at its best.	2004-07-03

However, the kimono that we see today is essentially the end of a long evolution of dress over a thousand years and what is worn now is essentially a fossilised costume.<br />This book gives you an illuminating look at the history of the kimono in Japan - how even the word &quot;kimono&quot; didn't exist before last century, when the Japanese became aware that there were &quot;other&quot; forms of dress.  We are also given insights into the dress of the lower class and rural people of Japan. They are often forgotten in kimono discussion, yet they developed a dress style that was both practical and indigenous, though it is dying in the modern age. There is even an extensive section devoted to the aristocratic 10th century kimono styles and colour combinations.<br />Lastly this book gives you insight into how the modern kimono is worn.  There is a wealth of meaning in dress design and how it is worn that mostly passes non-Japanese by and for a kimono to be worn with style requires a lot of social knowledge that not many other books will spell out for you like this.<br />This book is highly recommended if you have an interest in Japanese costume, history or fabrics.  It gives a fascinating account of how dress mirrors history and social changes.  However, if you are looking for lots of colour photos of kimono and their designs this book will probably disappoint you as all the illustrations are in black and white.	2004-06-29

Living in exile in Vienna at the age of 65 she recounts in flashback the last days of Versailles before it fell to the revolution in France.<br />The story is rather like watching a ship sink.  A world full of people and customs that are on the brink of extinction and right up to the last minute few of them want to believe that their world is ending.  Versailles and its inhabitants and centuries of customs vanish in the space of three days.<br />In this small novel the author brings to life for a short space the doomed world of the French aristocracy, told through the eyes of someone who lived on the fringes of their world, but still knew its inhabitants well.  This is not my favourite historical novel, but it is one that is memorable for its feeling of doom and how well the author seems to have caught the lost world of France before the revolution.<br />Would I read this book again?  At this point, I couldn't give a definite yes.  I would recommend you borrow this from the library to read before buying it to see if it suits your tastes in historical novels as in many ways it differs from the &quot;standard&quot; history story.	2004-06-20

Mary's husband, the King of France is dead and she finds herself in great danger.  The new King of France wants her for his mistress, and her brother wants her married to the Spanish heir.  However, Mary has a mind of her own and knows who she wants to marry and dares all to make it happen.<br />This a true love story in which Mary showed herself a woman of courage and perservence and was prepared to sacrifice everything she had to marry the man she truly loved.<br />Once again, this author shows a fine understanding of the Renaissance courts of Europe and England. She successfully displays the danger, formality and the risks of living under an absolute monarch.  It was refreshing to read a novel on this lady who has had so little in general written about her over years.  The blurb attached to this book said that the author did not agree with changing the facts of history to make a more &quot;dramatic&quot; story in her historical novels and this is easily seen in this well written book as all the major events in here are well chronicled in the &quot;serious&quot; history books.<br />The first book in this two part novel is ROSE OF ENGLAND.	2004-06-16

They tell the story of the youngest sister of Henry VIII, Mary Tudor - who was the beauty of the Tudor dynasty.  This instalment covers her life from her birth till the death of her first husband in France.<br />The story is replete with this author's trademark careful research and fidelity to historical fact, but this particular novel is only half a story in itself and needs the sequel to finish the story, which is somewhat of a shame as neither book is easy to find these days.

She came to England as a teenager and married a man dominated by his favourite, the Duke of Buckingham.   It looked like a marriage doomed to years of unhappiness.  However, that all changed when the Duke was killed and Charles transferred his affections to his wife.  They formed a bond of friendship and love that was to last the rest of their lives.  In a fairy tale this would be the &quot;happily ever after&quot; scenario.<br />However, reality took a turn of the worse eventually and Henriettas staunch and very public Catholicism in a deeply Protestant country was to cause the royal couple much anguish in the years to come as England descended into a civil war where Henrietta lost nearly everything she loved.  <br />This book chronicles a life of great changes and a watershed in English history.  At times the snippets of letters quoted between Charles and Henrietta are strangely reminiscent of those of Nicholas and Alexandra in the Russian Revolution.  Plowden has produced a biography that is easy to read, but not especially academic in tone. It sticks to the subject of Henrietta and does not get diverted into other lives except as they impacted on hers.  If you are after an accessible, modern history of Henriettas life then this is probably the book you are after. However, if you are after an academic book quoted entirely from sources within Henriettas lifetime you will probably be disappointed.	2004-05-26

The only other comparable book to it for images of the wider Romanov family is 'The Last Tsar' by Larissa Yermilova and thankfully there is not too much overlap in their photographic contents.  <br />Charlotte Zeepvat has divided her photos up in to topics such as: The Last Tsar, The Family, Born Romanov,  A Suitable Marriage, The Family at Work etc. Each photo in the book is captioned, often accompanied by a story either relating to the specific picture or some other anecdote of that person's life.  We get to see many members of the imperial family that often only get passing mentions in other books and this photo album will be an invaluable reference for photographic images of the various Romanov members that you will find nowhere else and is a great companion to this author's other book 'Romanov Autumn'.	2004-05-25

Both men and women were equal before the law and the women of ancient Egypt had many rights before the law that were not granted again in the western world till the late 19th century.<br />This book discusses male attitudes towards women, as has survived in ancient manuscripts, women in society and law, health and childbirth (where you can be disgusted by the medical remedies), dress and adornment, household duties and women of power such as the four Queens Regent of Egypt and the power and history of the Divine Wives of Amun.<br />For anyone who is interested in the lives of women in ancient Egypt this book is well researched and informative and makes an interesting read.	2004-05-02

Is that an oxymoron?  Well, if it is, then this book has managed to pull it off.  Its an enjoyable, funny and fast read. Lucern Argeneau is a reclusive best selling romance novelist who only writes &quot;fact&quot;.  He is also a 600 year old vampire who is most certainly not &quot;undead&quot; as Kate Leever, his editor, is about to find out.<br />Kate is sent to Toronto in Canada to get Lucern to agree to *any* publicity she can get out of him for her company.  She finds a horrible, surly, unfriendly man hibernating in his house - what a girl to do in the face of such obstacles if she is to keep her job when she gets home?  Kate is one stubborn woman and this is the story of how Lucern and Kate get to know and fall in love with the better sides of each others nature.  It also handily sends up both the Vampire and Romance book genres along the way and doesn't take itself too seriously.<br />For a new, and very funny, take on vampires this is a worthwhile read.	2004-05-01

When he saw his parents die in a shuttle crash he opted to trade himself to the Eubians in exchange for his uncle Eldrin, the Skolian Ruby Prince who had been captured in the war.  For Jai was the true heir to the Eubian empire, but he was also everything they despised - a \\"provider\\" psion and a Ruby Prince - both secrets of his past and heritage he had to keep from everyone in the empire if he was to survive even a single day.<br />This is the story of how Jai learned to survive as Emperor Jaibriol III and the difficult path to peace he finds at the heart of an empire that is the epitome of everything he hates.  This is one of the best books in this series, but its true strength lies in the way it builds on previous events.  In other books we have been given glimpse of the violent and corrupt Eubian empire and its vicious rulers the Highton caste but in this novel we get to know them in all their depravity and glory as Jai learns more about his father's people than he ever wanted to know.	2004-04-24

She lived through the War of the Roses and the end of Duchy of Burgundy and its eventual marriage into the house of Hapsburg.  <br />Margaret quite literally made the Marriage of the Century when she married the Duke of Burgundy in 1475 and her wedding ceremony was a display of unparalled Medieval magnificence.  After her husband's death in 1477 she spent the rest of her life in the lowlands as the powerful and much respected Dowager Duchess of Burgundy.<br />This is the only biography of this important, but mostly forgotten lady, in English.  Having said that however, it does suffer from the his-story syndrome that affects many biographies of important women right through till early modern times.  This book gives you a good panorama of the turbulent transitional period that Margaret lived through at the end of the middle ages to the first dawn of the Renaissance, but it fails to give you a good feel for her personality.  Instead it is the story of the events that took place around Margaret that she &quot;may&quot; or &quot;possibly&quot; had some influence on.  <br />This lack of real feeling for the Duchess herself more likely has to do with the lack of real sources of information on her life rather than the research skills of the author.  Although Margaret was a noted bibliophile she has left little real evidence of her interests and opinions of any real substance.  This book is lavishly illustrated in black and white pictures of the little that is left of Margaret's life, but in the end I felt I knew more about the deeds of the &quot;Great Men&quot; of Margaret's era than I did about Margaret herself.	2004-04-17

It is enjoyable to spend some <BR>more time with these characters as they go through some key experiences that <BR>allow them to defeat the dark god's plans.<br />While this novel is replete with many fantasy clichés it is still and <BR>enjoyable read, and at least those clichés are integrated in the story in <BR>such a way as to make them important turning points in the story as both <BR>Calean and Elandra find out secrets in their own pasts that prove to be of <BR>vital importance.<br />This books rounds off this series nicely. It will never be in the top 10 per <BR>cent of original fantasy novels but the series is a good outing in light <BR>fantasy. The only real complaint I have is the lack of such vital scenes as <BR>Kostimon's death which we only hear about second hand and well after the <BR>event. For such a world shaking change Kostimon's passing was only <BR>incidental to this story as this among many other potential story threads <BR>from the previous books were failed to be exploited in this novel.	2004-04-11

Olafur <BR>thinks this will seal the alliance with Selvart that he has sought to secure <BR>his borders and that Devlin's life and loyalty is a small price to pay. <BR>However, Devlin himself has other ideas on the matter.<br />In some ways this book is an anti-climax. Much of the story is not told <BR>from Devlin's point of view and as the land of Jorsk descends in to all out <BR>war we are told a grim tale with almost no lighter moments to break it up. <BR>In the end Devlin makes the best compromise possible out of a bad situation, <BR>but at the same time many of Devlin's key emotional growth points never <BR>really seem to be explained in a way that makes you feel more for him as a <BR>character.<br />For the last book in a series in many ways this book seems to be a pause <BR>rather than a stopping point for Devlin's story, and it would have been nice <BR>to at least have seen him gain some happiness from all his sacrifice, <BR>instead we are almost left hanging as much could still happen to him given <BR>the state the Kingdom is in at the end of this book.

Nick desperately wants to travel between the worlds but has been unable to summon the magic to do it himself till one day he finds himself suddenly somehow shoved into the dark paths between worlds where he must help 3 people to escape.  One of those people who asks for his help is Roddy.<br />This is an enjoyable novel for both younger and older readers, that follows the adventures of Nick, Roddy and Grundo as they try and get the adults of their worlds to believe in the conspiracy that only they seem to know about.  It's told from the point of view of both Nick and Roddy and the narrative is split between them and it holds you easily until the end of the book and leaves you wishing there was sequel where you could get to know more about these characters.	2004-04-08

It turned out to be a well written story that didn't let the romance elements overwhelm the action and the world building of the story.  Gillie and Mac are both strong and well written characters that you easily and quickly like.<br />AN ACCIDENTAL GODDESS successfully mixes a number of different genres and is both an enjoyable and worthwhile read and romance that is not too soppy or too reliant of bedroom scenes to tell its story.	2004-04-04

Inadvertently he gets caught up in a matter of Liaden honor and find himself transferred to the 'Elthoria' as Master Trader Norn ven'Deelin's new apprentice - and the first Terran ever apprenticed to a Liaden trader.<br />This is an enjoyable new installment in the Liaden Universe stories. It is a change of pace from the previous novels and does not have love matching as the center story. Instead we are taken on a very interesting trip through Liaden and Terran trade methods and customs.  This coming-of-age story seems to be set earlier than all the other previous novels and does not feature any of those characters, or even any of the Korval Clan.<br />In short, this is a very good introductory novel for those wanting to see what the Liaden stories are like and it is suitable for younger readers at well. It is a welcome change of theme that expands what we know about the worlds the Liads and Terrans live in and is a very good read.	2004-03-18

This book takes you on a journey through a painting and dye rainbow.  Through numerous anecdotes and stories we go hunting for things like the source of Indian Yellow, the lapis lazuli mines of Afghanistan, and the delicate green of the celadon porcelains of China. <br />One thing this book does is show the unreliability of mythic stories on the source of various colours and the secrecy and economic strength these dyes and paints held for various people throughout the centuries.  You will not gain all the secrets to the various colours of the rainbow in this book, but you will gain an appreciation for how much knowledge has been lost or corrupted over the centuries and how hard it was to develop simple things like colours that we take for granted today.<br />This book is recommended for anyone who has ever painted or dyed  - you'll get a new appreciation for those people in the past whose skills we probably really don't truly appreciate today.	2004-03-16

Its a dual romance story, that of Dr Eden Fynn and space pirate Jace Serafina and Captain Tasha Sebastian (Sass) and her commanding officer Admiral Branden Kel-Paten, who is a cyborg otherwise known as 'the tin soldier'.<br />The novel moves along at a good pace and has interesting main characters.  The thing I found most disconcerting about this book was the lack of any real development for any secondary characters. At times its like the entire universe consists of four people and two cats despite the fact you know that they are living in a heavily peopled environment like a space ship.<br />In many ways this is more of a character novel than it is an SF story despite what appears to be a strong SF universe at the start of the story.   If you like the novels of Catherine Asaro you may enjoy this book, though that strong SF universe gets badly diluted half way though the book.<br />COMMAND PERFORMANCE ends with an unexpected story twist and there is a 'to be continued' note stating that the story will continue with another, yet to be published novel, called COMMAND DECISION.	2004-03-14

Despite this, it is an enjoyable and fast paced novel that sees a lot of changes in its main characters. It also does not yield all its secrets in the first instalment of the trilogy.<br />Despite the clich&eacute;s the characters in this book are likeable and well written, and Eragon, the central character of the story is not overwhelmed in character, even by his dragon, which makes a nice change. The way they are written make you want to come back for book 2 in the series when it is published, and certainly that is a sign of a book you enjoyed.	2004-03-10

These secrets could destroy them both, and when Chaz finds out what Sully doesn't want known will her growing love for him enable her to survive and overcome life-long prejudices?<br />This is billed as a straight out romance so you know it is centred around love. However, it is also a well written fantasy-sci-fi novel that moves along at a good pace. It is peopled with interesting characters in a universe far from perfect.  It is also a novel that deserves a sequel to finish what is very obviously the start of what could be an interesting story to counter the corruption at the heart of power that Chaz and Sully encounter in this book. If a sequel is written, then I'll be reading it!	2004-03-07

Caelan discovers a treasonous plot that could bring down the empire and end all they know, even before the emperor dies, but can he, a mere slave, get the emperors ear and warn him before it comes to fruition?<br />Caelan and Elandra finally cross paths in this book, the plot of which takes place over a few days. Its an enjoyable novel, slightly marred by great jumps in unexplained time, whether this will be a series worth reading again will be determined by how well book 3 in the series brings together the plot threads in books 1 and 2.  I'm not sure if this deserves 3 or 4 stars, but given I haven't read the conclusion yet, I'll go with 4.	2004-03-02

Caelan E'Non is the son if his lands most renowned healer. He is expected to follow his fathers profession and is sent to school to learn the healing arts. The only problem is that Caelan has no interest in becoming a healer. Much to his father's horror it is war, weapons and the army that is his true interest, and a life choice that his father is prepared to thwart at any cost. <br />For Caelan his wishes are about to come true, but in a horrifying way he never anticipated.  It will lead him to the heart of evil that lays at the centre of the Emperor Kostimon's empire. However, this is not just Caelan's story it is also the story of Elandra.  The daughter of one of the empire's great nobles, she has been bought up little better than a servant in her own household, only to find that she has a \\"destiny\\" - one that does not appeal to her at all!<br />This is an enjoyable first instalment to the Ruby Throne Trilogy.  It ends on a dark note, but it will be interesting to see how the paths of the main characters cross each other in book 2, because there is no mistaking this for anything other than an introductory novel for a story far from finished.  And don't let the dragons on the covers of these books fool you, they feature only in a very small way in the book.	2004-02-29

Gregorieff During the Days of Imperial Russia	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Childhood memories of Imperial Russia	Concordia Gregorieff wrote this book with the help of Polly Zarella at the advanced age of 95.  In old imperial Russia, Concordia's father was at the time of the revolution an officer in the army and Director of the Imperial Palaces in Abas-Toouman in Georgia.  He was also a friend of the Dowager Empress and her two daughters Xenia and Olga.<br />These memoirs tell of the escape and decent into poverty and exile of Concordia's family.  That they all managed to survive the revolutionary years as a family and escape Russia at all was a miracle given the wrath of the mobs unleased against those perceived to be of the aristocracy or officer class in the armed forces.<br />This is an almost sepia toned memoir.  Gentle with the memories of a privileged and joyful childhood, and bitter and poverty stricken adolescence where family was all.  The story effectively ceases when they immigrate to New York and Concordia makes a decision on a proposal of marriage. Thankfully there is an epilogue which outlines the fate of the rest of Concordias family. Also included in the book are some signed photos and documents relating to the imperial family of Russia that her family managed to salvage from the wreck of their past.  <br />This is an easy to read biography of a woman who has seen great extremes of change in her younger life and may be of some interest to those who enjoy stories of Imperial Russia.	2004-02-25

At the time the war started Missie was a habitué of the diplomatic party circuit and friends with many of the German aristocrats of her parents class.<br />Missie, through her experiences in exile valued people on their own intrinsic worth and not based on their nationality and she proved to be a good judge of character.  Many of her German friends were involved in the 20th July 1944 plot to kill Hitler and finish the war.  Missy herself was lucky to escape the death squads that combed Germany afterwards and her diary chronicles the deaths of many of her close friends.  It also clearly portrays the horror of living under the allied air raids against civilians, especially in Berlin,  in the closing years against WW2 where luck, rather than good judgement, was a more assured method of survival.<br />Missie brings home the fact that \\"total war\\" is a horror for all involved and that there were 'good guys' and 'bad guys' on both sides of the conflict, but in the end it was the ordinary civilians who paid the greatest price for the folly of their leaders.  Possibly one of the areas that is an eye opener is the closing days of the war. An area little touched on in movies or documentaries.  We get to see some of the human costs of the disgraceful Yalta agreement that the allies signed with Stalin and the starvation and ruin that prevailed in Europe the years after the war.  For a civilian insight into the war on the continent this book is first class along with her sister Titania's autobiography.	2004-02-20

It is the first book in the Bridge of D'Arnath series, but it is a well contained novel in itself that does not end on a cliff-hanger.  It has some similarities to the authors previous books in the disgrace and suffering of the central characters in the novel, but for all that has a quite distinct feel from the characters in her previous books.<br />This is worth picking up to read if you enjoy a well written fantasy novel and looks like the beginning of an interesting series.	2004-02-14

Matthew's enemies have also come for a day of reckoning with Princess Teanna and her cousin Eric Duran coming to Sennia with plans that will surprise everyone.<br />The characters in these novels are well written and pragmatic and they are continually growing throughout the books.  This novel builds up to a great climax that marks a real turning point for all the characters. It makes you wish book 3 was available to read NOW.  These are outstanding fantasy novels with a \\"magic\\" that is based on science but it just as scary for all involved as it has the proven capacity to destroy the world and has already done so once - and as Matthew has found out power without knowledge (and experience) is dangerous to its possessor. However, to get the most out of this novel it is recommended that you read THE FIFTH RING first.	2004-01-31

It turns out to have been caused by a small girl called Deir in a village which is in the process of being conquered by the southern empire of the Exteca.<br />The Exteca are the possessors to two fearsome magics, spells of love and terror which they have used to conquer a large empire to support the sacrifices that their gods require for their redmagic (blood magic).  Calindor is unable to find an easy resistance to this magic and in desperation he learns some of the horrors inherent in the bloodmagic  so he can try and defend his people when the Exteca come north to his homeland as they inevitably will.  Deir returns to Cantera with Calindor but she has forgotten any magic she ever knew even though she is an even greater magician than Calindor.<br />This is a well written sequel that can be read alone, but you will get the best out of the book if you have read the previous title GREENMAGIC.  Peopled with characters you will like this story holds many of its great surprises close to its end, and once again reveals world shaking changes for a number of people.

While not wholly original in its themes this is still a book peopled with interesting characters that pulls you along to its end and makes you glad you read it.	2003-12-31

It starts with the birth of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of James 1st and continues through to the reign of Queen Anne, the last Stuart sovereign.<br />We are told something of the lives of most of the women in the Stuart family from 1596 to 1714, however the biographies concentrate on Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, who is better known to history as the Winter Queen, the daughters of Charles 1st, Mary, Princess of Orange, Elizabeth (who died young) and Henriette-Anne (usually known as Minette), favourite sister of Charles II and last of all Queens Mary and Anne, the last of their house.<br />We are not given individual separate biographies, instead the author has woven the stories of all these royal women in and out of each other as the times changed and their lives intersected.  This has resulted in some small loss of detail in some of these lives, but the reigns of Queens Mary and Anne are the most noticeable in only giving you a sketch of their lives on the throne.  The lives of the Queen of Bohemia and Minette are probably the best written in detail in this book.  <br />Although it may help if you have read something of this period before as the author appears to have made a few assumptions on prior knowledge of basic `big events' of the period discussed, this is overall a great introduction to the lives of these women, and it is one of the few modern books where you will find biographies of these various ladies all in one place.	2003-12-27

It is essentially a series of highlights in the life of the most famous of Blades, Sir Durendal.  I found this book a disappointment in many ways. Durendal leads a life of adventure and success, but for all that you don't really feel that you know him that well by the end of the story.<br />Another striking feature of the novel was how closely King Ambrose was modelled on  the real King Henry 8th of England with access to magic.  This book serves as an introduction to the Blades universe, but I'm not sure it's one that will make me follow through to read the other books in the series as for me this book was a curiously flat and uninvolving read into a distinctly boys-own world of swords and magic	2003-12-19

These ancient Roman mansions are often breathtaking inside and quite unlike what you will find in the stately homes other countries such as England or France.  In many cases the artists have taken whole rooms and turned them into one great 3 dimensional canvas showing scenes from mythology, history and nature.<br />This book is filled with wonderful colour photographs of the exteriors and interiors of various Roman Palazzi, covering many of the better known publicly owned buildings and some that are still privately owned.  We get to see such places as The Vatican Palace, Palazzi Massimo, Villa Farnesina, Villa Madama, Palazzo Altemps and Palazzo Colonna just to name a random few in the book.<br />If you have any interest in the Italy of old or interior design this book is a must.  You get a glimpse of the great Italian genius for frescoed interiors and a way of life for the very rich in the past that will never be repeated.  There is much more to see in Rome than the ancient ruins and this book gives you a glimpse of some of those treasures and will leave you stunned with some of the wonderful beauty of some of these palaces.	2003-12-14

Henry deTamble and Claire Abshire are in love, but the truly strange thing about their relationship is that Henry is a time traveler and has been wooing Claire since she was 6 years old. Something he doesn't remember when they finally meet in 1991 because for Henry, the relationship although it is in Claire's past, is still part of Henry's future.<br />This novel deals well with some aspects of involuntary time travel on Henry's behalf.  There's the embarrassing and life-threatening fact that his clothes don't go with him when he moves into the past or the future, and that for Henry cause and effect are not straight forward. However, at the same time other aspects of Henry's gift (or curse) are glossed over, such as when other people with the same abilities are supposedly found in the future, and the attitude of his workmates in the years after they find out about his ability.<br />The heart of this novel is the relationship between Henry and Claire and the strange paths it takes for both of them because of the simple fact that Henry time travels and it is the glue which holds the story together.  Even if you aren't into science fiction you will probably enjoy reading about Henry and Claire simply because they are such nice people and they keep on making you want to know more about how their story ends.	2003-12-12

However, if you buy this book expecting to read a biography of Mary de Guise you will probably be disappointed.  While Mary's political actions are dealt with in great detail, in the end you feel you really don't know that much about her. Instead you know more about how King Henri of France felt about Scotland, or the importance of various treaties than you do about Mary herself.<br />This is a first rate book for those who want to know the ins and outs of the various political schemes in Scotland from 1548-1560 but less successfully gives us a real feel for the personality of Mary of Guise. On the plus side the author has included a number of quotes from original documents in both their original French and with English translations for those of us not fluent in the French language and all the sources are well footnoted.	2003-11-15

This Book of Birds was published at the height of his career in around 1790.  This is a reproduction of the series of three books of bird woodblock prints by the artist in the metropolitan museum of art in New York.<br />The reproduction is presented in a folding format similar to that of old Japanese books or screens.  It is a beautiful work of art.  The only thing that hasn't been able to be reproduced is the embossing and gold speckles in the paper of the original work, but you can still see where they are in the reproduced pictures. The front of the book gives us an introduction to Utamaro and the back of the book translates the poetry on each page (by the greatest poets of the era) and identifies each of the birds in all the prints.<br />If you love birds and Japanese art then this a book you should put some effort into finding.    It's a rare treat for those lucky enough to have seen this reproduction.	2003-11-08

It's an ordinary life until one rainy night he interrupts a rape and robbery and inadvertently heals the victim of the attack.  <br />For Christian life will never be the same again. This is a power he did not want or ask for. When the media finds out that this was not a one off miracle, and he has the power to cure the incurable, Christian is literally on the run in order to maintain any slice of his life he can call his own. The healing does not make him a better man but it does make his life profoundly strange. In many ways this book is a modern allegory of Christ. Its well written and enjoyable and asks the question 'What would YOU do if the power to genuinely heal the sick was thrust upon you.'	2003-11-07

Arthur Penhaligon is about to die - only to be saved by the unlikely duo of Mr Monday and his butler Sneezer.  An action they both will soon regret as Arthur finds the key they have given him leads to an otherworldly house that is both the source of a plague in his town and the only place he can find a cure.<br />This is an original book, well written with interesting characters.

This time its not the creatures of Japanese myth instead it is a western wizard and the vampires he has created that threaten one of Kelly's clients.  Also thrown into the mix are the ongoing attempts of Haruko Tamenaga to avenge her father's death by killing Mage.<br />Read as a stand alone vampire novel I suspect that this book would be somewhat a disappointment. As a sequel however it works very well.  It mixes world wide vampire myth with modern thriller setting.  The author has bought us back to interesting characters that continue to evolve and also mixed in some new ones that will be welcome if there is ever a third book in this series.<br />This book should be part of any collection of books for people who enjoy vampire novels, but it will be probably enjoyed most by those who liked the first book explaining how all the main characters in this novel met and how Mage acquired his magic powers.	2003-11-01

When he runs into Amanda Sharmon at a Greyhound bus station in the backwoods of Canada he doesn't realise that by helping a stranger in need he is about to change his own life  - and get an introduction to the strange world of Japanese mythology.<br />I wouldn't call this a mystery novel, though it does have elements of that. Its more like a modern urban fantasy.  Its easy to read and the main characters are likeable, though you can get mixed up at times with all the unusual Japanese names which keep on cropping up.<br />If you like light fantasy and Japanese mythology then this is a book worth reading and I'm happy to read the sequel SHADOWS BITE and see if it is as enjoyable and light as the first book.	2003-10-25

She was bought up as the pampered daughter of the kingdom, but also to assume the financial responsibilities of the prudent royal.  At what was considered a late age, 33, she married Phillip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.  <br />Duke Philip was the most powerful non-crowned person in Europe at the time and was an extremely suitable match for Isabel rank-wise.  For the next 40 years Isabel played a decisive role in the Dukedom of Burgundy, mostly in diplomatic and financial roles. Isabel was related to the English house of Lancaster and spent most of those 40 years trying ally Burgundy to England and offset the influence of the French kings in the affairs of Burgundy in order to safeguard he son Charles's inheritance. Something she only had mixed success in as her husband had an almost blind faith that the French Kings would \\"do right\\" by Burgundy.<br />This is the first biography of Isabel and one of the very few available in English of any of Burgundy's Duchesses.  The author has produced a lively portrait of a very active woman and gives a clear outline of the political and financial influences that prompted many of Isabel's decisions.  This book covers the age of Joan of Arc and the early to late middle years of the Wars of the Roses in England.  Although these large political events took place outside Burgundy they did have a direct influence on Isabel's life.<br />If you have any curiosity about Medieval and early Renaissance Burgundy then this book is a must.	2003-10-21

However, thankfully, the author has provided us with a story that wraps up one main thread in this book.  <br />Gavril Andar is an artist, unaware that he is also the blood heir to the northern kingdom of Azhkendir. He is also ignorant of the fact that with this inheritance comes the unique family curse of the Drakhaoul which has passed on to him at his fathers death.<br />However this curse brings its sufferer tremendous power, at the cost of their humanity,  that has made the Kingdom of Azhkendir impregnable to invasion for generations and the men of his fathers court are prepared to do anything make sure that continues. Even if it includes kidnapping Gavril from his sunny homeland and forcibly installing him as Drakhaon of Azhkendir in the icy north.<br />Of the people in this book it is the abused servant girl Kiukiu who is probably best written, because somehow the other characters, including Gavril, seem to lack the necessary depth to make you feel with their anguish.  Despite this, I will be reading book 2 of this series as I would like to know the consequences of the resolution of this book.  I would rate this book 3.5 stars if It was a selection option.	2003-10-11

The Grand Duke was the eldest  of the 6 sons and 1 daughter of Grand Duke Mikhail Nicholaevich and spent most of his youth in the Caucasus where his father was Viceroy. In later life Nicholas was a well known and respected historian.  His works on Russian history and butterflies (both of them passions) are still respected today within in Russia.  These interests of Nicholas and his genuine scholarship, along with his love and respect for France and its political systems made him an atypical Romanov. This is a reasonably detailed and well researched biography that uses primary sources mostly from Russia and France.  The author does not hide the Grand Dukes acerbic and cynical nature or try to gloss over his more unattractive traits such as his inability to keep a secret or his anti-Semitism. However, at the same time the book does not really seem to pinpoint why the Grand Duke was a &#34;Pariah in the Family&#34;. The period of Nicholas life during the Russian revolution and the months leading to his death are particularly well documented in some detail, especially in comparison to some of his earlier years. This book is an important work in filling out the world of the Romanovs and brings to life a Grand Duke, who in most western works, has lived his life in the shadows until now - but who in France and Russia in his day was a celebrity based on ability as much as his imperial birth.	2003-09-24

It chronicles the influence the fashions of ancient Greece and Rome has had in more modern times on women's costume. <br />Printed on a very nice matt paper (even for photos) it contrasts examples of ancient art such as statues and painted vases with the work of later fashion designers. We get examples of the work of  Halston, Madame Gres, Prada, Liberty, Dior and Mariano Fortuny just to name a few.  This book is as much a photographic essay as is it is an exhibition catalogue.

These are Science Fiction rather than Science Fantasy novels.  A lot of thought has gone into the science behind this story of a sudden gift of alien advanced technology and the destruction of earth and humanity as we know it.<br />I have to say that I found this book slow going, especially in the early chapters. I wasn't expecting a novel that was so heavily science based. In the end I found this a well written story, with some very clever technological ideas, but at the same time a rather depressing book about a possible future for earth. We see our home destroyed in more ways than one and not just by aliens.<br />If you are after a real SF novel with well thought out science to back up an apocalyptic story then this book is for you - but I'm not sure its really my favourite type of story	2003-09-16

He was bought up in the stoic philosophical tradition of many of the Roman upper classes. However, for Marcus philosophy in all its forms was a life-long passion.<br />What we have here are essentially note books written by Marcus on lessons he has learnt from life, drawn from his background as an emperor, general and relatively unknown person when he was younger.  They are the result of a life time of thought on the human condition and mortality.  He often goes over similar themes, refining what he has to say, which means at times the book can be a bit gloomy, but that does not invalidate the value of  his observations.<br />Gregory Hays has provided us with a new translation of Marcus's books taken from the preserved ancient Greek manuscripts.  We have been given a colloquial and unpretentious translation which falls in well with what Marcus has to say.  Having read this it is easy to see how these manuscripts have stood the test of time, and that what Marcus has to say is still of relevance today.<br />To see how little human nature has changed in over 2 thousand years, this book is an eye opener and should be part of any collection of classic titles.	2003-09-14

She is both thrilled and dismayed when a local professor is found dead of advanced old age when the day before he had seemed a healthy man in his mid 40's.  This is one of the few genuine mysteries she has come across in her job and for once she sees a real chance to use her detective skills.<br />However, for Brandy this case is going to turn out to be one which throws her perceptions of people and her town in a tailspin.  She finally meets a man, Dan Martin, who's willing to take her as she is in a relationship (and not try to make her leave the police force) - but he's a man with a secret who can crack her case right open and lead her into the heart of darkness and corruption in the centre of the city. A darkness which could swallow both Brandy and Dan without a second's thought if they are not careful.<br />This is a well thought out police procedural novel.  It is filled with believable, human and fallible characters. Mysteries are not solved overnight and all the characters have a real life and normal day to day problems to deal with. In many ways this has been the best written vampire/detective novel I have read in a long time, and I can see why it justifiably received the Lord Ruthven Assembly Award.<br />If you like the vampire/detective/mystery sub-genre this is a novel you MUST pick up and read. It will be come a yard stick for many other books you might read in the future. Ignore the tacky cover, it doesn't do the contents justice.	2003-07-22

In the past history was essentially written by men for men, and showed little interest in the experiences of women, whether they were powerful or not.<br />In this book Judith Herrin has reconstructed the lives of three Byzantine empresses of the 8th and 9th Centuries. The lives we are presented with here are those of the empresses Irene, her grand daughter Euphrosyne and Theodora.  The lives of these women represent significant episodes in Byzantine history, but it isn't until you read a book like this that you realise how much of Byzantine history has simply been lost and distorted over the centuries. So much so, that it has been difficult to reconstruct the lives of these women in any great detail, especially that of Euphrosyne.<br />Thankfully for those of us who have not read much about Byzantine history the author provides a lengthy introductory section  which explains the city history and layout. The hierarchy of the court and the importance of eunuchs to both the empress and the empire and the public rituals important officials were expected to participate in.<br />Empress Irene came from Athens as a young woman and after her husbands death was regent for her son for over 10 years and eventually ruled in her own name for 5 years, an unprecedented act in royal circles in that time. Her grand daughter Euphrosyne was \\"born in the purple\\", suffered exile in her youth only to be bought back as empress later in life. Her successor was Theodora who has come down to us as a saint for the re-instating of Icons as a tool of worship in Byzantine churches, something which persists to this day.<br />This book covers the years when the veneration of icons ripped the church and Byzantine society apart for close to a century.  These empresses were instrumental in the re-instatement of icons as a central item of worship in the Byzantine church.  This is an easy to read book, but one that is obviously full of researched depth.  It has impressive notes and sources at the back. If you have any curiosity about female rulers of Byzantium this book is a must.	2003-07-12

Almost every second fantasy novel on the market now seems to be about Dragons, and I mostly read this one because I enjoyed this authors previous books.<br />Aidan MacAllister is first cousin to King Devlin and the finest musician the world has seen for 50 generations, called blessed by the gods by those who have heard him sing.  Then at 21 years of age he ignores a warning from his cousin the King to stay away from the dragons of his army because he makes them uneasy with his music.  Aiden then has his best friends killed in front of him and he taken away into solitary confinement where he is tortured for the first 10 years and kept in total silence for the next 7 years.<br />Suddenly released from prison one night he does not understand what he did to deserve a punishment so severe  one which did not kill him but has crippled him for life and killed his art in his heart.  Aiden sets out to find out the truth behind his imprisonment and finds he has unexpected allies and friends in places he never suspected.<br />This is an enjoyable novel, though Im not sure if it is meant to be a stand alone book or the start of a series.  The ending is open enough that another book could easily be written to complete the story (I dont think its totally finished anyway).  Aiden is a character you feel sympathy for and wonder at his gift of music, but if this is meant to be a stand alone novel then I dont think Im totally satisfied with it which is why I would give it 3.5  4 Stars.	2003-07-06

It covers such areas as the influence of the Ballets Russies in Paris prior to the revolution, the clothes the exiles bought with themselves, and the importance of the Kokoshnik to Russian fashion design.  <br />We are also given the history of the now vanished Russian émigré communities in Constantinople in Turkey, Berlin in Germany and Harbin in China, with a smaller amount of discussion of the communities in Paris and London.<br />London and Paris mostly get discussed in context with fashion, as many émigrés, both noble and poor made a living in the various parts of the fashion industry in exile.  There is a whole chapter devoted to the house of Kitmr with its exquisite embroideries and beading, which was run by Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna the younger in the 1920's.<br />The author has also unearthed other Russian émigré fashion houses which were well known and respected in the 1920's but are mostly forgotten now, houses such as Anely, Mode, Paul Caret, Tao, Yteb and Irfe which was run by the Youssoupoff family.<br />The majority of the book concentrates on fashion, but there is also discussion of the theatre, cafe's and other craft oriented activities which the Russian communities produced, especially in the 1920's.  Many years of painstaking research as been conducted by the author to reconstruct this lost world. The book is full of black and white photos, which I imagine would not have been easy to find.  However, if you are looking for nice colour photos of Russian costume, you will not find it here, but if you are trying to find something out on the background on émigré communities or the Russian fashion industry in the 1920's this book will be the standard work for many years to come.	2003-07-05

For the last 50 years the sword has been lost to knowledge when it vanished during the invasion of Duncaer and finding it now is seen as a fools quest.<br />When Devlin finally sees a painting of the sword he is stunned, because he knows this sword and has held in his hands as an apprentice metal smith, and he is in despair at the games the gods have played with his life and the knowledge that the Geas will force him to seek the sword out.<br />The pacing of this book is different from the first instalment in this series. A large section is devoted to the journey to Duncaer (a month's travel by horse) and the troubles that Devlin discovers when he reaches his old home.  <br />We finally get to meet Devlin's old friends as he confronts his past and we learn about the complex family and justice traditions and laws of his homeland.  I really enjoyed this book and we continue to see growth in both Devlin and the people he knows.  I'm very much looking forward to the final instalment of this series \\"Devlin's Justice\\" when it comes out next year.  It's just a shame we have to wait so long for it.	2003-07-03

However, he still has some kin obligations to forfill, and in order to do that he needs something he doesnt have  money.  So, in desperation, and in the hope that the role will kill him swiftly, like it has done for all other recent holders of the rank, he applies for the Jorsk position of Chosen One.<br />Much to his, and everyone elses shock Devlin is not killed in the oath taking of the Chosen One, or even in the first of the heroic missions he is sent on.   The Chosen One is an ancient position in Jorsk, but the kingdom, despite holding a stranglehold on Devlins homeland for the last 50 years, is in serious decline.  Its borders are beset with troubles and its King weak and in the hands of self-serving advisors.<br />Devlin in his role of Chosen One is forced by his oath to put justice and the kingdoms needs before his own  even if that means his own longing for death.  Devlin is a well written character. Hes not a man of many words, and he is tormented, but this book drags you in and keeps you interested for its length. He is a classic outsider who proves to be more than first appearances lead you to believe, and his character, and those around him grow in the book.  This is a classic sword and sorcery book, and it does have a magic component to it, but at this point Im grateful no dragons have turned up.<br />Im looking forward to reading book 2 of this series, which is thankfully already released, so if you want a no stress, enjoyable fantasy read these are recommended.	2003-06-29

The focus of the novels have now shifted to Claire's younger (and most powerful of the keepers as we are constantly reminded) gay sister Diana.  Claire is still part of the story, but more of a sub plot, with Dean and Austin as a back story to the save-the-world-from-the-mall main storyline. <br />Huff has tried to split the story between the two sisters, and in the process you feel like the novel lacks focus. A great deal of time is spent crawling around the mall trying to work out what is wrong and with a rather heavy handed \\"romance\\" developing between Diana and Kris, one of the street-people-turned elves inhabiting the mall.  The whole Diana romance subplot seemed rather a waste in many ways as you never really do get to know much about Kris aside from the fact that Diana is attracted to her and in now way does it compare to the  Dean/Claire storyline of the previous books.<br />I'm sorry to say, that if this series continues to focus on Diana I'll probably drift away from it. As a character I like her much less than Claire, and in this particular novel I found the sub-story of Dean/Austin and the Mummy more interesting than what was happening at the mall, and Diana's constant little sister put downs of Claire didn't help me make like her any more as a person.<br />For a novel that tries desperately to be witty and fast moving  and contemporary I would have to say that the cats and Hell probably are the funniest bits of the story and this is the weakest installment in the Keepers series so far.	2003-06-28

However, I picked it up again at a later time and read it again when my memories of my first reading had somewhat blurred.  Somewhat to my own surprise I found that I really enjoyed the novel and I found much in it that I had missed when I first read it and have since read it more than twice.<br />Martin Martel is a rebel.  He fell in love with the daughter of the ruler of his planet.  For this crime, and also because he was found to have high esper potential, he was exiled to &quot;the planet of the gods, &quot; where for all intents and purposes he became one himself.  However, Martel does not believe in &quot;gods&quot;  no matter what fancy name or titles they use and he knows that he is human and is determined to live like one despite what the other &quot;gods&quot; and local mortals try to force him to acknowledge.  He is a stubborn man beyond all reason at times and more powerful than anyone else realizes.<br />This book is almost abstract to read, it leaves a lot the to readers imagination, but it is also lyrical and almost poetical at times.  It is my favorite book by this author.  The story itself is an allegory of the fall of the gods of ancient Greece in a scifi setting, about the consequences of denying the truth of your  own abilities and the risks people take in forcing action when some things are better left alone.<br />The individual qualities of this book my be blurred if you have read much of this authors later work as his writing style has in many ways remained remarkably unchanged, and he continually explores similar themes and hero-types, but for me, this the first book of this author that I read before he become well known will always remain my favorite.	2003-06-26

She's now filthy rich and the owner of a salvaging empire that spans the galaxy.  She's got more sex and alcohol  on a regular basis than even she can handle.  To top it off she's bought peace and prosperity to Barious, her very own kingdom - now the centre of her recycling empire.<br />However, its all about to explode on her. Her lover Van Gar is tired of being Drew's lackey and when he finds her sleeping with 3 men, 2 women a midget and a goat he decides he's had enough and leaves her for a new life as a farmer. In the meantime, her husband the King of Barious decides that he doesn't like the fact that his previously regal kingdom is now the happy and wealthy universal hub of \\"filth\\" and plots to start a war with the neighbouring Lockheeds to regain what he sees as  his kingdoms lost glory.<br />For Drew this is not good news and most importantly its going to cost her a lot of money in lost profits and under no circumstances is that to be allowed!  Drew is a foul mouthed over-sexed larger than life character.  Her quest to stop the profit drain and get back to the things that really matter in life like sex, beer and a peaceful garbage scow in space make this a fun book that's as enjoyable as its predecessor \\"Queen of Denial\\".  This is a funny book to read, so in the words of wisdom from Queen Drew......\\"So kick back, pop a brew and wait for the fireworks\\" and enjoy a well thought out and plotted book that could come from no other author, but don't buy this book if you intend to take it too seriously - this is a book written for laughs - so sit back and enjoy it.	2003-06-20

Hawklan has finally recovered some memories of his past. Enough to identify who he had been in the first war against Sumeral, and they are not happy memories for him.<br />Peppered throughout with little observations full of wisdom on the cost of war, these books are well written and enjoyable. This brings together all the threads of the previous books as the Orthlund, Fyorlund and Riddin people all march against Sumeral's second coming and into the mist shrouded land of Narsindal.<br />Hawklan finds some unexpected allies in his quest into Narsindal and the \\"small and ancient\\" thing prophesised by the dying king in book 1 which destroys Sumeral in the end may not be what you think.<br />This series of books called \\"the chronicles of Hawklan\\" form the centrepiece of Roger Taylors world spanning series of fantasy novels. There are a number of other books which feed in an indirect way into this same story. All the books come together for their conclusion to the overall story in \\"the return of the sword\\" which in reality can be said to be the true end to The Chronicles of Hawklan.<br />While these books could be classified as sword and sorcery they are well written with likeable and well drawn characters that you feel sympathy for. The political systems of all the lands involved are well thought out and they all have a history dating back to at least the first war against Sumeral. Even if you don't read The Return of the Sword, this book provides as satisfying conclusion to this sequence of books.	2003-06-02

Chris Cséjthe the almost-vampire is back.  Now living in Monroe he's working as a part time private investigator and university lecturer, and life is pretty good for him with the exception that his werewolf lover, Lupé, has left him because she couldn't stand the competition from his late wife's ghost taking up Chris's attention.<br />Things unexpectedly start to unravel for Chris when he takes a case to investigate if a local psychic is the real thing. It turns out she is and she has some dire warnings for him.  Then another vampire turns up in town and tries to kill him and the local corpses start turning up on his doorstep asking him to dispense justice for them because he stands between life and the undead - and the local police are NOT impressed.<br />This is a wise-cracking, literary and fast moving novel.  Chris reads like an old friend. Once you start this book you'll want to see how it ends as Chris is pushed to his limits and finds out more about himself and his new powers than he ever guessed.<br />I'm already looking forward to the next book in this series, and hoping its as much fun as the first two books. If you like your vampire/supernatural novels with a twist that doesn't rely on sex and excessive blood then these books are worth reading, but start with the first book to get the most out of this one. Though I do hope the next book will tie up some threads left dangling at the end of this one. (eg what happened to his secretary and her sick nephew etc)	2003-05-27

Hawklan has faced Dan-Tor and has lain in a coma ever since he was saved by Isolman.  Queen Sylvriss has escaped the destruction of  Vakloss and is now carrying the king's child and has run to the Rebel lords for help.  <br />For the first half of this book Hawklan effectively plays no part in the story as he is in his coma the entire time. Instead the story concentrates on the secondary characters and the quest of the Queen to awaken her father's people to the danger they stand in and the training of the Orthlund people for the upcoming battle with Sumeral.<br />This is a much slower paced book than the previous 2 instalments in this series. However, it is still a well written book and is obviously a set up for the final showdown between good and bad in the final book of the series.<br />Peopled with enjoyable characters and a well thought out world, this series of books so far has been much better than many other ongoing fantasy series I have read over the years. Recommended.	2003-05-24

However, what he sells are not what they seem.  This leads Hawklan on a quest to discover the source of the poison that has been sold to the people he loves, and it's the start of world changing events for everyone, with Hawklan as the unexpected catalyst.<br />This book is well paced and written and Hawklan and his friends are characters which grow on you with affection.

The unthinkable happens when Loman's daughter Tirilen is kidnapped by High Guards from Fyorlund.  Hawklan finds that he has to go against his healers instincts and offer violence to help rescue her. He also finds that he has an unexpected ability for violence and that he is, unknown to himself, an expert swordsman and military field commander.<br />The rescue of Tirilen leads Hawklan and his friends to finally realise that things outside Orthlund are much worse than they ever imagined and that the peaceful land of Fyorlund across the mountains has been slowly corrupted in their lifetime and they must investigate or find themselves overwhelmed in the second coming of the evil Sumeral.<br />This book is a well written and enjoyable continuation from the events in the first book of this series.  It could be read alone, but the real benefit comes with reading it directly after the first book.  These are a well thought out fantasy series that has no pretensions to being another \\"lord of the rings\\" but is still a very enjoyable read for those who love this genre by this lesser known British author.	2003-05-16

However, Gem doesn't like being used, and likes it even less when they hurt his cousin in order to get a hold on him.  Gem is about to teach the local crime boss a lesson she'll never forget and will propel him into a destiny he never would have guessed, one that has been outlined in the prophecies of two different worlds.<br />The authors of this book are better known for their Liaden series, and in fact this book bears some similarities to that series.  The main characters all place a premium on courtesy in their society and a quite formal and in that sense you feel you are reading and off-shoot of the Liaden universe.  <br />I liked Gem and the other man characters of this book and read it quite quickly. However my main complaint is that this book is only the beginning on Gem's story. It's like a taster and the ending is very abrupt and in many ways inconclusive.  There is a lot in the story that still needs to be filled out and its obviously going to take a few more books to do it and I was left with the feeling at the end of The Tomorrow Log that I'd only read half to three quarters of the story, and felt vaguely cheated.  I want to know when the story is going to be concluded!	2003-04-10

In this book we get a completely different view of the `events' of the revolution.  <br />The author of this book was not a person of title, but her family background was aristocratic. However, by the time she was born her family was living in St Petersburg on the edge of real poverty.  Her father had left her mother when she was only a child and her mother was bringing up 3 children with no real support and hardly any income.  This only got worse as time went on and more and more of the family possessions were sold to put food in their mouths, and jobs were always scarce.<br />By the time of the revolution Edith had already experienced dire poverty and living from meal to meal just to survive.  This book chronicles a life of real hardship and survival and hope for life at its worse.  That the author lived to write this at all is testimony to her ability to survive the worst human nature can inflict and the value of true friends.<br />While the author lived through the revolution this book does not describe the `great events' of the revolution.  Living in the milieu of ordinary life these mostly passed her over and in many cases, because of the lack of news, she never even knew what was happening.<br />This is the life of an ordinary person in the Russian revolution and the hardship and deprivation that the `ordinary' survived through the early years of communist Russia.  All told this is an outstanding biography and deserves the Bodley Head award it won in 1941.	2003-03-27

However, she is better known to history as Daisy, Princess of Pless.  At 18 Daisy was \\"sold\\" into marriage to the Prince of Pless, a man with a distinguished linage and a large family fortune based on mining in the 'backwoods' of Germany.  Daisy thus abruptly left a life she loved in England to live in a country where she didn't speak the language and knew nothing about its customs or even her husband.<br />Daisy's life was one of great contrast, going from society hostess and friend of kings and emperors to dire poverty and discrimination in both world wars because of her English background.  This book is subtitled \\"A Discovery\\" because the author has taken the time to explore the various interests that Daisy developed as she grew older and as her awareness of the world and the suffering in it around her changed.<br />This is a well written, and obviously well researched book.  It is helped immensely by the diaries and autobiographies that Daisy wrote later in life - these allow Daisy to speak with her own voice in this book.  But the author has also gone to the trouble to track down unpublished diaries and to explain the social background behind Daisy's decisions during her life.<br />All told,  a well written, and very interesting biography, not just of Daisy but the times she lived in.  If you have any interest in late 19th century Germany or simply want to know more about the much quoted \\"Princess of Pless\\" (often referred to in other Edwardian biographies), this book is definitely worth picking up.	2003-03-15

She's also the world's only female werewolf - a legend in the werewolf community (all men) before she survived the change after being bitten. It makes her hot property as the possible mother to a \\"pure\\" werewolf race in some eyes.<br />My problem with this book is not the writers skill at telling a story so much as that I found I simply didn't like Elena.  For me she was *too* beautiful and feral and abused to really relate too.  It wasn't helped that Clay, her ex-boyfriend-cum-lover was even harder to like as he came across as a totally amoral person that made you wonder what (aside from looks) attracted Elena to him in the first place.<br />About half way through this book I found myself putting it down and picking it up without any real urgency to finish it and ended up sort of skimming through to the end. The result of reading about people I never really seemed to connect to.  Also, werewolf-ism with this group seems like rabies or aids. Never let them slobber on you - you'd be doomed!	2003-03-07

The photos presented here were taken by Francis Firth a Derbyshire photographer who travelled to Egypt and the middle east a number of times in the 1850's and 60's and recorded what he saw with these fantastic photographs.<br />The photos are all clear, beautiful shots, like the best of 19th century photography.  You get to see views like The Pyramids of Giza and Dahshur, the temples of Dendera, Karnak, Luxor, Thebes and Edfu all buried in sand or in their \\"original\\" ruined 19th century state.  In addition to the wonderful parade of Egyptian photos there are also scenes from Jerusalem, Gaza, the dead sea and Baalbek in Lebanon.<br />This is a wonderful book that takes you on a visual trip to the past. Recommended for anyone interested in Egypt or 19th century photography.	2003-02-08

It gives you a background to the various Lao communities, explains what sort of textiles are woven and how they are used in daily and ritual life.  There is also a basic guide to the meanings of various designs that are commonly found in these weavings.<br />The hand woven textiles of Laos are intricate and gorgeous displaying a wide variety of technique from ikat to supplementry weft weaving that gives the impression of embroidery.  They are made in coarse cottons through to gorgeous silks - mostly on home looms by women in villages. That these wonderful textiles are still being made today is in some ways a minor miracle and their revival in recent times is something we should all be glad of.<br />The middle section of this book contains colour photographs which give you a good feel for some of the range available in this textile work.  While this book is not the last word on Lao textiles is a fantastic introduction to a sometimes under-rated art form.<br />If you enjoy hand woven textiles an excursion into the world of Lao textiles is very worthwhile and rewarding and here is a good place to start to get a feel for their beauty.	2003-01-28

It concentrates not on the Tudor monarchs but on their various cousins from the first generation of those related to Henry VIII though to those who were still around at the time of Elizabeth 1st death.<br />This book is well researched and written and is particularly good in covering Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox and Margaret, Lady Strange - both people who only get short mentions in many books.  It discusses things like the annulment of various marriages and the impact of legitimacy in relation to the throne - and how both Mary and Elizabeth were not in a situation to comment too much on it or they risked their own claims to the throne by the terms on Henry VIII  will.  The author has also taken the time to point out gaps in documentation on the lives of these various cousins and has reproduced some letters not seen in other books on the same people.<br />I suspect at times readers may become slightly confused by the cousins as their stories weave in and out of each other and as some people change their names with various marriages and the acquisitions of titles. However, if you have any interest in the minor Tudor royals this book is defiantly worth picking up, as I've certainly read worse accounts of these people's lives.	2003-01-26

This is the 11th book in the Vampire files series, and it is still immensely readable with great characters that are like old friends by now.<br />This book starts with Jack and Escott finishing a nasty kidnap case, that turns out to have unexpected consequences for them all.  Jack's club \\"lady Crymysn\\" has turned into the neutral zone of the Chicago ganglands - however that doesn't stop gang trouble landing on Jack's doorstep at a very inconvenient time.<br />This is a well told story with twists and turns throughout that keep your attention riveted, though at times you do feel sorry for Jack given the sheer amount of times the poor man has been shot, tortured and staked at various points throughout these books.<br />While this novel can be read as a stand alone, to get the most out of it you should read all the series in order.  This is an evolving series, where the characters change and the events in one novel can have consequences in another.<br />I'm already looking forward to the next book in this series as it's such great fun following the adventures of Jack Fleming and his friends.	2003-01-17

It is a stand alone novel that is much better than many of the current fantasy offerings on the shelf for sheer quality of writing and enjoyment in reading. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down as really wanted to know how it ended, always the sign of an above average novel, when you don't stall at some point and have to make yourself pick up the book to finish it.<br />This book is the story of Cazaril, a man who thinks he has been broken by the reverses life has bought him and only wants a quiet corner of the world to spend the rest of his days. What he wants and what he gets are two different things, because the old family friend who he asks for help ends up giving him the job of tutor and secretary to the princess (royess) of Chalion (her grand daughter) who is living in the household. Cazaril did not expect this and the consequences for him and the entire country will not be anything he has forseen.<br />This book explores themes of renewal, redemption and the workings of the gods and universe. It is a feel good, and exciting novel. Bujold's non-Vorkosigian fantasy has noticeably improved over the years and I will be quicker next time to pick up her novels outside the Vorkosigan universe.	2003-01-13

They are presented as a people in touch with nature, who live for honour and battle.  A world where strength rules all.<br />This book brings to life the story of the 'rape' of the Amazon (or Tal Kyrte, \\"the free people\\" as they call themselves) Queen Antiope and her \\"abduction\\" to Athens by Theseus.  What follows is a monumental war that will change both the world of Athens and the Amazons.  It signals the end of the way of life and not the glory and victory foretold at the start.<br />This book is well written, based on both ancient myths and modern Archaeology.  How accurate it actually is we'll probably never know.  While well written this book should only read if you have a high tolerance for battle scenes.  For me, these were the only sections which somewhat dragged.  They were well described and pivitoal to the story but the blood and gore does get to you after a while.<br />In short, a well crafted, but bloody novel.	2003-01-12

Charlie Stone is a CIA analyst who is asked by his boss to find more information on a document reference called \\"the Lenin testament\\".   Charlie is reluctant to pursue this, even though he is aware that both his father and another old family friend might be able to help him, because of old scandals within his family.<br />However, against his better judgement, he does follow up this information, which leads him deeper and deeper into a conspiracy involving people in high places in both the USA and Russia - where people's motives are not what they seem.<br />Finder has crafted a well written, well paced and enjoyable post cold war novel with this book.  It's a what-if situation that could have happened in Russia - but if it did we would probably never know about it.  His use of terrorists as scare-mongers to initiate official action is almost eerie in the light of events over the last few years, yet this book was written in 1991, when terrorists did not have the cachet they have now.<br />With a great story and characters you care about this book is worth picking up to read if you enjoy a good thriller.	2003-01-06

Lousia Antrim was a Lady in Waiting to Queens Victoria and Alexandra of England and accompnied them on most of the state events and overseas trips they went on.<br />This book is just packed with inside royal information and ancedotes.  It also has an amazing collection of royal photos and odds and ends.  Things like signed photos of various royalties, meunu's from various occasions, personal snapshots, postcards etc that Louise retained from her various royal jaunts.<br />This is a lovely, and in some ways very personal book.  You get to see the floatsom and jestom of royal living (eg menus etc) that mostly don't appear in other books.  It gives you a great feel for the period and lifestyle Lousia lived.<br />If you are intersted in the royal heyday of the 19th century and early 20th century this is highly reccomended.	2003-01-01

The title is misleading, because you get the impression that it is all about Nicholas 2nd. However, a large chunk of this book is also devoted to earlier reigns.<br />Full of clear and uncommon photos of the Romanov dynasty, this book is worth buying if you have any interest in the last imperial family of Russia.

Past this information is usually scanty.    This is the first full biography of Xenia's life.  The first section dealing with her life as a member of the imperial family in Russia is not terribly enlightening.  This is probably a reflection of lack of documentation available, and the fact that Xenia was naturally a shy and retiring person.    Where this book comes into it's own and provides masses of new information is in dealing with Xenia (and the Royal families) experience in the Russian revolution and in her life in exile after the revolution.  Xenia became the hub of a large family and the focal point of many émigrés in  her  long exile and this book brings that into focus at last.    This book also has a pile of new Romanov illustrations, though sadly missing any of Xenia in all her court finery, we do get to see photos her large extended family at last.    This book is actually a UK publication, and can be bought cheaper at amazon.co.uk     If you are interested in the life of the Romanov survivors after the revolution this a book worth buying.	2002-12-06

The latest installment of the Dresden Files finds Wizard Harry Dresden in a faerie war between summer and winter, with more than just finding a killer at stake.<br />The previous book in this series was almost painful to read as Harry tangled with the local vampires to a cost that was almost impossible for him to bear.  At the start of this book he is still in deep depression.  However, this wallowing doesn't last long, as Harry is confronted with a client (and possible income) that can't be refused.<br />These books are intelligent and well written, with strong characters that you care about.  It is magic set inside the world we know, however the action in this book mostly takes place outside this world in contrast to the other installments so far, which take place in and around `normal' Chicago.<br />It will be interesting to see where this character goes in the next book, as all the events in these books are built on each other.  They are best read in the correct sequence to get the best  out of them and the careful character development that has been built into them.<br />If you like your fantasy mixed with mystery this is a series you should pick up.	2002-11-26

Instead of concentrating soley on Henry this book attempts to fill out the background of the court he lived in and the people he interacted with an a daily basis.<br />You get things like an explanation of the various court titles and functions and how they changed over the course of his reign.  There are also sections on costume and painting and the interactions of the various noble families (and not so noble) during Henry's lifetime.<br />This is a 'widescreen' biography, not a narrow view.  It's full of interesting, small details of daily life that are missed in the larger political biographies.<br />This book was a welcome and refreshing take on Tudor history.  Reccomended if you want to fill in the background details of Henry's court.	2002-11-16

For once we get to meet the other family memebers, learn about their personalities and what events shaped their lives and the fate of the dynasty.<br />We also get to read in detail about the various palaces and estates the family used.  These are often referred to in other books without any real background information on their history or importance to the family being described.  This book fills that vacume.<br />If you know nothing about the Romanovs this is a fantastic place to start as all these people's live stories weave in and out of each other to create an amazing and true story.	2002-11-12

This book concentrates on Dhyianna Seli, the Ruby Pharoah at the time of the Radiance War.<br />Unlike many of the other books in this series, this one does not concentrate on a romance, including grand sex scenes. Instead this is a political outing, which describes what happened in a political sense at the end of the Radiance war (primary iverson & the radiant seas).<br />Dhyianna comes across as being absolutely essential to the empire and her complaints of the control the skolian assembly has over her family has a sort of hollow ring given how much of what happens in the empire revolves around her individual skills.<br />For some reason, in the other books you get the impression that the 'trader experiment' which produced the hightron race happened in the recent past, but in this book that event is redefinied as having taken place thousands of years ago (which makes more sense).<br />This is not the most inspired book in the series, but it's a definate building block to be read for filling out the Skolian/Allied/Trader universe and the interesting mess that is the Ruby Dynasty.	2002-11-01

This book is an excellent example of investigative journalism, in that it illuminates the ordinary and finds the extraordinary all around us.  It's introductory chapters give an excellent overview of the rise of the fast food industry over the last century and its influence in modern society and how it affects the quality of what we eat and our health.<br />Possibly the most distressing and eye-opening chapters to read are the sections on the meat industry in the US.  You'll never look at mince meat (or any meat if it comes to that) in the same way again.  Do you like excrement in your food? Well, even if you don't you are probably eating it according to this.<br />For those outside the US (like me), what is upsetting about what is covered here is the import of these systems of manufacture into other countries along with the large fast food chains like McDonalds.  The overseas impact of these chains, with their generally bland and unhealthy food, wiping out local customs is well described in Zaiuddin Sardar's \\"Why do people hate America?\\" (available from Amazon UK, not published in the states), however, this author does not shrink from describing the reactions of overseas nations to the rise of these largely American fast food empires.<br />Having read this book, you may think twice about the goals of fast food advertising and ask yourself if it's really worth your long term health to keep eating these foods. Personally, you won't catch me inside the majority of the fast food chains if I have any choice in the matter.  The more I know about them the gladder I am I stopped being their customer years ago, and as the author rightly points out - it's you - the customer, who has the power ultimately to change or destroy what you don't like about what you eat.	2002-10-26

This book can only really be appreciated if you have read parts 1 &amp; 2 of the series (Transformation and Relevation).  It's hard to know what to write and not give away any major plotlines.<br />In this book Seyonne finds some hard won, and unexpected truths about the ancient war that ripped his homeland apart.  He also finds he must make a larger sacrifice than he ever dreamed to prevent himself creating a worse situation in the future.  <br />The other characters you grew to enjoy in books 1 &amp; 2 are not forgotten here, but the real strengh of these books is in the character of the narrator, Seyonne.  He keeps the books &quot;centered&quot; and you have a central character who you really care about and can understand.<br />All three of these books were an enjoyable read and I look forward to more books by this author.

The pictures stir the imagination and the text provides the facts to go with the pictures.<br />In fact I recently used this book as my guide while visiting Angkor.  It provides a section for each of the most-visited temples and will also give you information on suggested time to put aside for each visit and the best time to go.  In fact, my guide at Angkor said this was the best guide book he had seen, and I saw other people using this same book to guide themselves around the temples like I did.<br />This book provides suggested itineries to the temples and the best times to visist for photography. whether you can actually manage to combine the two is debatable on a short visit.  The books main downfall is not its content, but its weight which is quite heavy because of the good quality paper used.<br />The climate (extremely hot and humid - air conditioning is a worthwhile investment) can make visiting these monuments as trial at times, but they are worth the effort.  All the buildings are unique, covered in exquiste carvings (which books can only hint at) and original.  Some are still partly swallowed by the jungle. Straight out of indiana Jones.<br />Get this book, let your imagination wander and visit these amazing ruins if you can before too many other tourists turn up - for they are a world wonder not to be missed.

The author presents a very academic overview of the life of rural Georgian women in England in the 18th and early 19th centuries.<br />A lot of original research has been done for this book and it shows in it's content. The author highlights the lack of real research that has been done on the lives of women in this period.  However, despite a well timed re-assesment of the lives of these women, this is essentially an academic work.<br />It highlights the fact that things have never been as bad as many other (feminist) books make out - in essence Jane Austin shows us close to the real world as people lived it in her novels.<br />This book is dry to read, but full of many every day facts for those interested in the &quot;real&quot; lives of 18th century country women.	2002-01-23

It gives you a concise and well written account of how amber was formed and where in the world it is found.  The Baltic area is one of the more prolific locations, but it is also found in places like Dominica and Burma.  It also provides information on fakes and how to test amber, with practical instructions on how to do so.<br />The book is full of beautiful, clear photographs.  However the emphasis is heavily on amber inclusions such as insect and plant life.  If you have amber and you want to identify the insect/plant in it, then this is the book you want.  It's overall content has obviously been heavily influenced by the movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.<br />However, despite these good points it does have some significant weakness'.  It gives little information on the colour ranges available in amber.  Some sort of colour chart would have been useful.  It also does not supply information on the care and storage of amber. <br />In short, this book is a great introduction to amber and it's inclusions, but does not extend beyond that into amber artwork or some practical areas of amber ownership/maintance.	2002-01-16

In fact some of them could be more correctly called novellas than short stories.  The link between them all is that they are all extemely well written, and their main characters have been involved in war in some way.  Most of these are not new, but put together like this they make an outstanding collection.  Included is one Miles Vorkosigan story (not new) if you are looking up this book because of that author's series.<br />This book contains the following stories:<br />&quot;Call him Lord&quot; by Gordon R.

This is only a small book (less than 100 pages), but it packs a lot of ideas into it's content.<br />This is an &quot;objective&quot; view of the 20th century trend towards mass murder, and the forces described in this book, while based in a european context can be seen to hold true for virtually all &quot;modern&quot; societies, including Asia and Africa.<br />The author explains the link between a well organised bureaucratic organisation with an objective view to &quot;processing&quot; people through their rules.  The danger of having large groups of &quot;displaced&quot; and &quot;no-nation&quot; peoples combined with a tendancy to rationlise away those peoples &quot;rights&quot; in society - to make them effectivley &quot;non-people&quot; and outside the law.  It also brings home the reality that power *does* corrupt - or at least finds excuses for all it does to other people.<br />The author has presented us with a possible bleak future in many ways.  This book is also a mirror to how we justify the choices of our modern life and the picture is not always pretty.<br />In the past, where &quot;jews&quot; may have been the target, today discrimination is trending towards the poor, and once again with the displaced and dispossed.  Read in conjunction with &quot;no Logo&quot;, this book is very enlightening - though out of the 2 books this is the better written.  Worth picking up, reading and keeping.	2002-01-08

In many ways &quot;nick knaks of the french interior&quot; might be more accurate.  This book has some discussion of French aestetics, and some overall views of interiors, but concentrates on individual items such as furniture, porcelain, clientele and furnishing textiles.<br />The book has some lovely photographs, but if you are looking for a book full of wonderful photographs of 18th century French aristocratic interiors, then this book is probably not for you.  Most of the photos are of the smaller items like nick knaks that make the &quot;feeling&quot; of French interior design.<br />For an overview of the great interior artists of the bits and pieces that make up french interior design this is good, but it's certinally not a comprehensive guide and in many ways is a dissapointing book.	2002-01-04

For all that time none of these great heros succeded or came back - till Shielder's Mark did.  <br />And there's the problem, because Mark is no noble hero in the traditional sense, instead he is a pratical pesant with big dreams.  Mark claims his princess and finds out how much the fairy tales *didn't* say.<br />This is a well written novel.  Aimed for &quot;young adults&quot; it can be read by anyone who enjoys an original, well written fantasy story.  All the characters have a depth and honesty to them that is refreshing, and the writing style is descriptive without going overboard.  <br />Having read this book, I now plan to look up more works by this author, who appears to be a hidden gem of the fantasy/young adult market.	2001-12-24

This book is a direct continuation from the stories found in these author's &quot;partners in necessity&quot;.  While it can be read as stand alone novel, it is recommended that &quot;partners&quot; and &quot;pilot's choice&quot; be read first to bring the characters and their backgrounds into context.<br />Most of the main characters in the previous novels in this series either get an outing or a mention in this book, which is part of an evolving series.  However, &quot;Plan B&quot; is an action-adventure novel, rather than a straight love story which is the core of most of the previous Liaden novels.<br />Having said that, it's also half a book in a way and is a definite set up for the conclusion of the current series in &quot;I Dare&quot; which is due out in 2002.<br />This is an enjoyable, well paced novel, with well defined characters.  At the end of it you will wish &quot;I Dare&quot; were already published so you can finish the story.	2001-12-20

Unfortunatley, for him, he was dedicated to his calling and chose to stay in Tibet to look after his paitents.<br />This opened him up to over 25 years of reprisals and mistreatment by the Chinese soley because he had been connected to the dalai lama before his flight.<br />Tenzin grew up in a very poor part of Tibet and it was only through personal persistance and sacrifice that he managed to become a first class doctor of Tibetan medicine and carry on it's ancient traditions.  His childhood was hard, but it was mild in comparison to the horrors inflicted upon him by the Chinese after the invasion.<br />In this book you will read about practices, that in sheer evil, match anything the Nazis did in WW2.  You see the systematic repression of an entire people and their culture, which would not be too harsh to be called genocide.  There has also been a corresponding destruction of the physical landscape, with forests and animals that had been preserved for generations willfully destroyed.<br />A depressing and illuminating book at times about man's inhumanity to man, but also a book of miraculous survival.  It brings home that fact that all &quot;things&quot; can be taken away from you but knowledge is our true treasure in this life and it also brings home the buddist view of impermanance as a fact rather than religious doctrine.	2001-12-12

But she doesn't know what she's getting into as things aren't what they seem.<br />This novel is not big, but it's well written, funny and not padded out to excessive length.  If you've ever seen the old tv show &quot;quark&quot; it brings back some memories of that in a strange way.<br />If you like humour in your SF then this is a book worth picking up as it has some laugh out loud moments and it's an original and well told story.	2001-12-09

It was also the year that the Duchess of Devonshire held the fancy dress party of the century in her London mansion.<br />This book gives us a glimpse into a now legendary party.  The cream of London society took place in this event - if you weren't invited your were not part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  This party involved months of planning and the aristocracy of the time spent small fortunes to re-create &quot;authentic&quot; outfits of the characters of their choosing.<br />This book gives you short, but well written biographies of all the main participants of the ball, what they wore, and where it is available their memoirs of the occasion.  The book is also sprinkled with photographs of the participants all dressed for the night. My only complaint is that some of these photos are too small to clearly see the fantastic outfits and jewels the people are wearing.<br />This book also has a number of rare photos of the interior of Devonshire house before it was demolished, with the furniture intact.  Most photos you see of the interior of the house show it stripped of it's fittings and ready for demolition, so these are interesting to see.  For a glimpse of late Victorian high society this book is a must, as it contains many bits of information on the ball's participants not available from many other sources.	2001-12-09

She was destined to be a matrimonial pawn for her family because of her closeness to the throne and the immense fortune she inherited from her mother.  She was in her time, the richest woman in France and it's greatest heiress.<br />We have been fortunate that Mademoiselle thought to write her memoirs during her lifetime.  These have been used as the basis for this book.  However all her assertions and ommissions have been cross-checked.  The author presents a fairly straightfoward accounting of the princesses life.  From her early years and the inattention of her father, Gaston (to whom she owed her royal position) and her conflicts with the court, to her later disgrace and exile and grand love of the Sun King's courtier Lauzun.<br />At the end of the book are three lengthy appedix' (or essays more correctly) dealing with Mademoiselle's writings and her much coveted fortune.<br />The only complaint I have about this book is that despite lengthy sections dealing with Mademoiselle's writings we actually hear very little of her voice in it.  We are given a fairly objective view of her life by the author, but it could possibly have been enhanced by at least one section which let Mademoiselle speak for herself.  <br />One earlier english work on Mademoiselle &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot; by Francis Steegmuller, 1956 reproduces her written &quot;self portrait&quot; and this book is worth looking up for that alone.<br />Aside from the text it is nice to see such a well bound and produced book as this with nice study covers and acid free paper - designed to last the test of time.  A timely reivew of this very active princess' life.	2001-12-01

Terraforming has provided the new worlds needed - then disaster strikes.  An alien life form, the quill, somehow takes over the new worlds and makes them uninhabitable and earth is ruthless in quarantining earth from it's influence by preventing immigrants from returning home.<br />A generation later, the descendants of those who tried to immigrate are still stranded on obselete and decaying space stations.  Aaron Pardell is one of those people, and unknown even to himself he is the only person to have gone to one of the infected worlds and lived afterwards.<br />Dr Gail Smith tracks him down to find out why and if he can help with finding a way to destroy the quill.<br />This is very thick novel.  Dense in descriptions and explanations of the universe that has been created.  Too thick in fact.  While I completed this novel and liked the characters in it, I felt I was wading through a lot of un-necessary explainations to do it and that the story could have been improved if it was a bit tighter in execution.<br />While I can't say I'm sorry I read this book, I know it's one I won't bother to read twice.  Essentially this is love story, and the real core of it is the people, but they do get swamped at times by their surroundings.	2001-11-29

Her name often comes up as a passing reference in English history of this period, but most books don't go beyond the fact that she lived in an unusual menage de trois with her husband and Lady Elizabeth Foster later in her life.<br />This is the true story of a woman of great gifts, who through folly in her youth spent the rest of her life paying the price for it.  It is a story of excess and living life to the hilt, an unhappy marriage and love in unusual places.  Real life really is stranger than fiction.<br />This book is well written and detailed and successfuly brings Georgiana, her family and friends to life.  However, if you read this book be prepared for large doeses of English politics as this was one of the passions of her life and without following the politics of the period many of her actions would not make sense.<br />An illuminating and worthwhile book, with lessons for us all on the consequences of obsession.	2001-11-29

It is heavy in photographs of Queen Victoria's family and her descendants.  It deals not only with her children, but their children and grandchildren.<br />The pictures in this book are all of good quality, and some are not commonly seen on books on English royalty.  Each photograph has a little story attched giving you some information on the person in the picture and something about what path their life took.  There is some intersting information and suprises in these little stories.<br />The photos are divided into both private and public, so you get a mixture of family photos and some of royalty dressed to the hilt in jewels to die for.<br />An interesting, but slightly dissapointing book, as I would have loved to see more 19th century photos and maybe a greater range of formal pictures.	2001-11-29

It shows the worth of double checking your sources when doing research and questioning 'experts'.  Mind you, this could also apply to this book to some extent as it could have been improved with more chinese sources.<br />Where this book fails is as a biography of Tzu-Hsi, she only takes up a small section of the book, the rest is all explanation of various plots and &quot;foreign devil&quot; attrocities in china.  Nobody comes out of it well.<br />For an interesting (and probably mostly correct) overview of 19th century China this book is invaluable - as a biography of Tzu-Hsi it does not accomplish a great deal and you feel you know very little about the subject at the end of the book.	2001-10-31

There are also a few pieces of featherwork thrown in.<br />My only dissapointment with this book was the lack of secondary textile objects such as featherwork head ornaments or fans.  But you can't have everything.<br />A good book to buy if you are into pre-colubmian textiles or art work.	2001-10-28

They are almost like diary entries, fresh and true descriptions of her experiences.<br />You get to see all the festivites and offical functions surrounding the Russian coronation - a trip back to Paris via Scandinavia - London high society, Scottish scenery and the Court of England.  It's a facinating insight by someone who was &quot;in&quot; with these circles.  The trip to the Russian Coronation is particulary well done and if you are searching for information on Imperial Russia this is a set of memoirs worth reading.<br />Illuminating letters that have withstood the test of time well.	2001-10-23

They sit on the head like a halo and bring to life the myths of royalty, aristocracy and an apparent lifestyle of unlimited money.<br />This book presents a stunning array of Tiara's with many photos that you would be hard pressed to find in any other book.<br />Having said that, it is the photos which let this book down, not the text which is very interesting in it's self.  Each Tiara is photographed in colour, but they appear to have been cut out from their photographed background and superimposed on the book's creme page background. This gives the Tiara's a feeling of slight unreality and flattens them out taking away their 3D reality.<br />There is also a facinating array of photos of people actually wearing these Tiaras, and it would be worth buying the book for that alone, except the majority of these pictures are produced at thumbnail size or stamp and you need a magnifiying glass to see them well.  A shame as it wastes amazing photo research, and does not enable me to see well photos I otherwise would have been astonished to see.<br />Having said all this, if you have any interest in Tiara's or jewellery history this book is a must, but beware of it's shortcomings.  An exhibition cataloge it must have been stunning to see this array &quot;in the flesh&quot;.	2001-10-22

This book is a fairly straighfoward accounting of the lives of Henry 8th's children (plus Lady Jane Grey) from his death to the accension of Elizabeth to the throne.<br />There's not much particulary new in this book, and you would probably be better served by individual biographies if you want their lives in depth.  In particular I found the lives of Edward VI and Lady Jane quite sketchy, with Elizabeth and Mary being better delt with.<br />However, if you don't know much about this period of England's history this book would be an excellent introduction and overview as the author's writing style is very clear and staight forward.	2001-10-01

(which it doesn't when you know how it's made)<br />It is also about a fundamental changing attitude in industry (such as it is) about how goods should be made and marketed.  These changes in attitude have had a direct impact on our lifestyle, choices and urban landscape.  The logic that &quot;if we get other people to make the goods (dirt cheap contractors overseas) and we only sell the product and reap in the profits&quot; doesn't sit well with keeping people employed in the home market with enough money to buy the goods on a sustainable basis.<br />This book concentrates on the garment and fast food industries, but take a walk down your local shopping centre and it's easy to see the things the author is talking about.<br />I've personally noticed small business being swamped by malls that force the rent to high for them to continue in business and as a result if you are not a chain brand you aren't in a mall.  There's also the dramatic expansion of the predominatley american/international chain food brands taking up more of the urban landscape and eroding local culture.  It's been sad to watch.<br />This book is essentially a description of consumer and economic rationalisation gone mad, where the dollar means more than the community and building a better life for us all on a long term basis is not really on the agenda.<br />If you found this book of interest you may also find &quot;daughters of the Pacific&quot; by Zohl de Ishtar of interest, as it covers the economic and social consequences of eroding culture in the interests of money etc.	2001-09-30

Apparently a universal law.  This book is funny and in many ways orginal.

It explains how traditonaly society in the middle east has based itself around family/clan ties then religion and then state last of all.<br />In fact the concept of people belonging to and owning loyalty to a state is quite new to the region in many places as they don't have the long history of it that Europe has.  It also explains how long standing traditions within holy law govern such things at the correct treatment of non-muslim minorities (in theory).<br />If you really don't know much about middle eastern and arab culture this book is a good introduction, to a society that is in many ways fundimentaly alien to western culture.<br />It should be noted that this book is ONLY an introduction and in many ways has a lot of generalisations, but it's a good starting point if you don't know much about arab culture (like me).	2001-09-20

The author appears to have a very good grasp of Muslim values and the resentment that first world countries (read europe and the USA) have stirred up there, by very effectively using divide and conquer methods.<br />However, all this is just background for a well written character based story as we get to know Kay and the &quot;robot&quot; John Halton better.  <br />This is not based in some future where all our problems have been somehow fixed, instead it is based on a continuation and intensification of todays trends.

If you are after archaeological research by people who have worked in the field and have finally been able to publish what they have found then this book is probably for you. I'd classify this as a reference work, not a general use book, especially for people new to the area this book would be difficult to use.	2001-08-31

However, despite some rambling on about &quot;wonders of the world&quot;, which I thought beside the point, it has some useful background information about the Nasca and Inca peoples.<br />What this book does is successfuly emphasise how little we actually know about Nasca and the Pampa.  The lines were NOT ment to be seen from above in a plane but formed,in some now indescribable way, a central part of community and spirital life of these people for centuries.<br />I found this book wandered around all over the place on topics not related to the lines or Nasca people, but I found it useful to fill in background information on the people themselves (what litte of it exists) and that is what I was after.  I now know that most of Andean archaeology is based on a large dose of guesswork.<br />The lines are approched by the author in context to their enviroment and the people who built them - a wise and long overdue assement in my view.<br />This book is worth it for the background information on the Nasca even if it dosen't offer any real &quot;answers&quot;.	2001-08-31

It's not a large book with only 44 pages. It does however have some beautiful illustrations (it's all in color)and examples of pre-Columbian textile work in the Andes. The work covers most of the different cultures that flourished in the Andes up to and prior to the Inca. There is also weaving and featherwork on featherwork on display. A slim, but very nice book with a good selection of items. This book is heavy on illustrations, light on text, but each section has a nice succinct introduction to the culture of the items being illustrated.	2001-08-28

This is the biography of Adeline Yen Mah.  From an unpromising beginning in life - it only got worse!  For most of her life she was abanonded by her father or ignored as the most hated of his second wife's stepchildren.<br />Adeline could never understand this. No explainations were offered and all she wanted was to please her parents and live up to chinese family expectations.  All she got was grief and abanonment for her efforts.<br />That Adeline triumphed over this is a minor miracle.  However, it wasn't all good news and right to the end of the book, with a few exceptions, like her younger sister Susan, I was very glad that none of her relatives were mine!<br />Malice may gain you money and material wealth as this book shows but it also makes you poverty striken in other ways.  It also pays not to be played the fool by these sort of people.<br />This is another sorry story from China -but from a 'wealthy' familiy - but in money only.	2001-08-23

When an exiled US industralist decides he wants revenge on the people who ruined him there he hires the best terrorist he can find to do the work.<br />&quot;the prince of darkness&quot; as he is known in the trade (by the few who know him at all) is an intelligent and totaly amoral character.  On the law enforcemnt side in the US we have Sarah Cahill a former expert in terrorist actions in the FBI.<br />This book it has to be said, is full of anagrams, but then I suspect that the world of law enforcemnt is full of them now - and being somewhat of a techno-thriller they go with the genre.<br />One of the things I liked about this novel was that none of the main characters are invulernable.  They are people with lives of their own in an extraordinary situation.  Sarah is not as 'strong' as her terroist opponent - but that only makes her more believable.<br />I'm looking forward to more books by this author, and if you like thrillers this book is worth picking up.	2001-08-17

It's not heavy on text, but that is partly due to the fact that as the author states, there have been virtually no proper excavations of Nasca burials to base information on.<br />What you get here is litrely pages of gorgeous photographs of existing early nasca needlework that the author was able to locate in various collections.  He has concentrated on pieces with a provence in the nasca or ica valleys.<br />This book is illuminating, but to get the most out if it you should look at a book that has been written on the earlier, related Paracas style in order to really see the differences between the two styles, as they are often confused in non-specialist books.<br />Beautiful, colorful, inspiring and educational.  This book is a must for anybody interested in ancient peruvian textiles or arts or who just wants to see rare textiles that are as good as anything else produced anywhere in the world over the last 2000 years.	2001-08-09

The author his prinicpally used sources contempary to Eleanor's lifetime and where possible double checked every rumor and story.  As a result, quite a few of the previous 'assumptions' about her life has been blown away.<br />This book can be said to be sort of dry, but it is honest.  And the 'dryness' is only a reflection on the lack of documentation for the period - not on the author's ability to tell a story coherently.  I've never read any of this author's books before, but I think I'm about to.  She has provided fresh research instead of just rehashing old material - taking nothing forgranted, and that alone makes this book worth reading.<br />For what is left of the REAL Eleanor I doubt this book can be beaten unless new documentation comes to life.  Although, reading it I think her life would make a geat novel!	2001-08-08

Despite this, I thought I'd give it a go, and it turned out to be a well written and well thought out story.<br />5000 years ago a survey team from another human world came to Earth and landed in Egypt.  Their home world was for all intents and purposes destroyed in their absence and a string of unfortunate events left them stranded on earth.<br />5000 years later, the people left on their home planet desperatly need the technology that allowed the survey team to get to earth at faster than light speed.  So they send their own team to retreive it....things get interesting on earth from that point onwards.<br />This is just a brief outline and does not do the story justice, you'd have to read it to see what I mean.  But, if you enjoy stargate you may enjoy this new twist on ancient history.	2001-08-07

I found that 98% of this book details the beautiful and complex textiles of the Paracas.  It had little of what I actually wanted, but it does give an excellent background to surviving Paracas textile (and textile related) artifacts.<br />It filled in background blanks for me and this book would be excellent for anybody who is researching, or who wants to know more about these textiles.  In parts it is quite technical and detailed.  There is a colour section illustrating various textiles in the centre of the book, but the emphasis in on scholary interpretation and not light reading.	2001-08-01

The textiles and featherwork produced there was outstanding.  We have been fourtunate that these people lived in a very dry region and had a tendancy to bury their dead in their best garments.<br />This is an exhibition catalouge, but in addition to beautiful pictures it is heavy on information.  This deals specificaly with the Chimor culture of the north coast which flourished from around 700AD till they were conqured by the Inca's in around 1470AD.<br />This book gives you technical details of how their textiles were made and breaks them up into periods and styles.  You also get information on textiles that weren't in the exibition but are relevent to the research the author has done.<br />If you have any interest in the textiles or featherwork of ancient Peru then this book, though focused on a very narrow area, is a must read.	2001-07-20

Garreth Mikaelian is the original vampire detective, and he's finally back.  This book takes place 15 years after the last book in this series (bloodlinks), and the fact that Garreth doesn't age as 'normal' is now starting to become a talking point among his family and the people he works with.<br />This is an inevitable situation for any vampire-sytle character, if they survive long enough, but not many books actually chronicle with how it would be delt with, given the links to the human world that any vampire would need to survive.<br />Garreth is grounded in 'real world' police procedures and its limitations, and in many ways that is what sets this series apart from many other 'cop-vampire' books.  There are very definate limits to what you can do as a police detective, and still stay as one later when the adventure is over.<br />In this book, Garreth gets caught in a car accident in daylight, and his is girlfriend killed, while the people who deliberatly crashed into him drink his blood when he is unconcious, beliving him  dead.<br />Garreth is shattered by this turn of events, but in a whirlwind of anger and fear that new vampires have been created, he sets of on a cross country chase down what turns out to be a serial killer.<br />In many ways this book is a real turning point.  What has gone before can no longer be continued and by the end great changes have occured in all the main characters life.  It'll be interesting to see where the next book goes.<br />This book will not be for you if you like vampire stories to be horror stories or full of romance and sex, because this book is really about how a policeman, who just happens to be a vampire, learns to deal with the world as it comes without bending the rules so much that the story becomes ridiculus.<br />Lee Killough writes fine police based books and by the end you always have the feeling that in the 'real world' this could just have happened.  They are always worth reading more than once.	2001-07-13

She also gives a lively characterisation to Cleopatra.  That said, however, the book is long, and I found myself drifting, and I never finished it.  I'm not quite sure what is wrong with this novel.  <br />The author is gifted, but I suspect this is like one of those long movies that goes on just that little bit too long and destroys what would otherwise be an amazing outing.	2001-06-29

It goes to show that with a bit of digging into the past you can unearth some real treasures in more ways than one.<br />This book tells the story of a woman who was born the daughter of a French herald, with no noticable prospects before her.  Katherine de Roet is a little known (today) figure of English history, but she is still important. For without her long term liaison with John, Duke of Lancaster, much of English history (and it's royal family) as we know it today, would never have happened.<br />The author has done a pile of original research for this novel (some of it is detailed at the beginning), and it pays off with a rich portrait of Katherine, her times and the people she lived with, through the ups and downs of her life.<br />All said, this is a superior historical novel, that makes you wish you could find out *more* about the real (not just the novel version) Katherine Swynford.	2001-06-29

They stumbled on a pre-Inca tomb of unsurpassed wealth (read: gold) at a site everybody else had written off as already having been plundered.  Unfortunatley, for them, greed was their undoing.<br />What they did manage to sell on the market was mostly exported out of Peru before the archaeolgists at the local museum found out what was going on.<br />This book details an investigation into international art smuggling, and the parallel investigation into the Moche site that the tomb robbers had found and the archaeologists later excavated.<br />In style, this book is esentially an extended magazine article.  The text is quite large and easy to read. It's not really a big book.  There is a colour picture section in the center of the book, but it can't really be called an academic book.  In my view what really lets this work down is the lack of drawings etc of the historical site and excavation that they are talking about in the text.  <br />If you've never read any books on the Moche before (and I haven't except the occasional magazine article), this book leaves you feeling somewhat dissasisfied because you want to know *more*, but it's a great introduction and overview to a series of very important events in re-discovering this ancient civilisation.	2001-06-25

You may think you are getting a translation of Maya Heiroglypic history - but you are not - in fact, you are getting more than that.<br />The author has produced an in-depth overview of Maya history from Prehistoric times until it's demise.  It goes into detail on such cities as Tikal, Copan, Palanque &amp; Quirigua for example.  What you will get is a conglomeration of all the research in these areas in relation to history, art, architecture, politics and religion where information has been found.<br />This is a very informative book and reccomended for an overview of the entire Maya civilsation.  It brings into context what caused the changes in Maya civilisation (where we know it) and the limitations on the knowledge we currently have.  <br />A word of warning however - despite being 'reader friendly' this book can be slow to get through if you don't have a long background in Maya history because of it's sheer depth and array of information.	2001-06-09

Tig has held &quot;the lady of gil&quot; off destroying the world for all that time, while he and his family and friends sail the world, looking in old archives etc for the answer to Tig's problem.  How to destroy the lady without destroying the world.<br />In all that time Tig has not aged a day since he took on 'the pain' but he has become incresingly eccentric - and when he looses control vast amounts of people can easily die.<br />This is not told from Tig's point of view but from the point of view of his son Vero.  Finally, after all these years, Tig decides it's time to go back to Gil to find out if there are any answers there, as they can only find partial answers outside Gil.  When they get to the island, things have changed Drastically.  Not necessarily for the better.<br />This book completes this story and ties up loose ends from books 1 &amp; 2.  Once again, the author has shown consistent good writing.  This author is one to watch out for from now on.	2001-06-09

The books have been consitantly enjoyable, with a heroine who has good instincts, but is otherwise about as 'ordinary' as the rest of us, and who unlike some other people, hasn't let the job title 'bounty hunter' go to her head.<br />It's the people around Stephanie who make her stories so memorable in a way.  Her crazy grandmother Mazur, Joe, the gorgeous cop sort-of-boyfriend, the drag queens and her mortal enemy Joyce and Lula the ex-ho filer.<br />In this book stephanie gets what looks like a simple pick up for a lady named  Maxine.  It leads to arson, murder and sex.<br />I'm really enjoying this series.  While these books can be read independatly (the titles have numbers in them to give the order), they are best read in sequence to appreace references to past events.  Extremely worthwhile crime fiction, I can now see why everybody raves about them.	2001-05-31

She paints a very vivid picture of Mary, Queen of scots in this novel.  You get a great feeling for her life while she was at the court of France and Scotland.  She is convincing in her descriptions of the state of mind Mary was in when she made her life changing decisions.<br />What really lets what would otherwise be an outstanding book down was her portrail of Mary's life during her in prison in England.  This period of her life is delt with rather sketchily and the people she had to interact with are kept to a minimum despite the fact that she delt with some of the most powerful people in England (even though she was in Prison).<br />This is a well written novel for Mary's court life, but not a really balanced view. But despite this, I still think it is one of the better novels on her that I have read.	2001-05-26

These progresses were not simply a case of the queen going on holiday.<br />They were quite complex political and social outings, and the queen was acompanied by the better part of her court.  They also needed to be planned well in advance - to ensure the queen had places to stay and eat for the length of her journey.  <br />Most history books will tell you the &quot;queen went on progress in such or such year to this location&quot;.  Most do not give you any specific details as to what she did, or what she had to do to get there.  This book fills in some of those blanks for at least 2 of her summer progresses through the english countryside.  You get details of where Elizabeth was on given dates, who she stayed with and their history, and what speeches etc were made.<br />For a short period of time you get a detailed look at Elizabeth and her court in this very interesting book.  The book is 152 pages long, and has B&amp;W photos illustrating relevent locations and documents - there are no colour photos.<br />If you are intersted in having an in-depth look at one of the Queen's progresses, this book is hard to beat.	2001-05-23

In this way it's somewhat like the situation in the Anita Blake (author Laurel Hamilton) novels, but in someways I think better written in this book.<br />Sookie herself is unusual with a disability that makes dating a virtual impossiblity until a vampire comes to town and she discovers he's her (almost) perfect man.  Unfortunatley, at the same time people start getting killed, which most of the locals see as an unlikely co-incidence, and in a small town that can almost be deadly itself.<br />The author has written a very readable book here.  I'm not sure if it's the start of a series or not - if it's not - then it's still an enjoyable stand alone novel.  Her characters are believable and likeable, and I don't remember any slow patches that make your attention wander.  In fact, I read this in a day - the sign of a very good book for me.<br />For those people who like fiction that covers, vampires, PSI, alternative realities or mystery fiction, this book pretty well covers all those areas.

You gotta love the Cat Austin - he really brings this book to life and it's his mission in life to keep the soppy moments in perspective and himself fed:)<br />For a good laugh this is highly reccomended, but read &quot;summon the keeper&quot; by the same author to get the most out of it.	2001-05-02

This book should be read after the first book in this series &quot;Telzey Amberdon&quot; to bring it into perspective.<br />Essentially, this is a series of linked short stories and novelettes.  The writing sytle is simple and easy to read.  All the main characters are polite, even the the bad guys!  They would easily be suited to younger readers.  <br />This second book introduces the readers to Trigger Argee, who doesn't have the mental &quot;super powers&quot; that make Telzey such a striking figure, but who is never-the-less very capable.<br />These books have been enjoyable so far, but really bring home how much SF has changed in recent decades.  These characters are much less introspective than most modern SF characters, even in short stories, and the emphasis is definitely on action!<br />I also agree about the cover.  &quot;TNT&quot; is really on the corny side - ignore it and concentrate on the contents.	2001-04-28

It's not because the central idea of the story was bad, but because of the over-elaborate descriptions the author is using in every scene.<br />The early books in this series were essentially mystery novels - now they are pyschoanalysis and soft porn.  This must be one of the few novels I've read where it can take a whole chapter for the author to write about getting out of an airport and into a car and another whole chapter to get out of the car into the house.  Every single utterance in between is of earth shaking significance (or so you would be lead to believe).<br />The characters surrounding Anita keep telling her the violence is too much, to get out of it and settle down.  I have to agree - at this point even reading it is burning me out.<br />On the up side, it was interesting to have Edward aka Ted fleshed out and to see how Anita works outside St Louis (a mixed bag).  It bring the focus back on Anita which I think is important.  However, having said this, I've also come to the conclusion that this is NOT a book I'd read again, and the whole series has just become too stung out for me now and I don't think I'll be reading anymore.<br />It's not a terrible novel, but it's not really inspiring either.	2001-04-20

Harry Dresden, wizard and main charcter of this novel is very well written and likeable.  He's fallible and has his limits, but he's also not someone you'd want to cross the wrong way lightly.<br />This book is about a werewolf &quot;invasion&quot; of Chicago.  People start dying messily on the full moon and it doesn't take long for it to click with Harry and Detective Murphy from the Special Unit of the Police that &quot;werwolves&quot; are the most likely culpret.  However if you are the police, no matter how messy it is that's not really the sort of conculsion you can come out with publicly.  And besides, there are more than one type of werewolf and silver doesn't always do the job of stopping them.<br />This is more violent than the first book, but you also get some more insights into Harry's past and Harry also realises that he has been taking the wrong approch to some things in his present.<br />If it keeps up it's current quality, this is a series I  intend to an eye out for.	2001-04-15
US	52960608	RSAVTQ9MEFPW3	1557739730	823004685	The Werewolf's Sin	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Formula Werewolf	This is the last book in Cheri Scotch's werewolf trilogy.  This book takes place about 25 years after the second book &quot;werewolf's touch&quot;.  It contains to varying degres the characters found in book 2 and book 1 from what I can gather, bring them all together.<br />Once again the cover of this title is a bit misleading.  Billed as a romance, it has enough well-described sex scenes to fit into that catagory, but otherwise it's more about a group of people-cum-werewolves.  They must hide under every tree in southern Louisiana.<br />This book is almost formula written. It is in the same format as the second title in this series, with a simple modern day story wedged between another linked historical story.  In this case, the first, evil werewolf, Laycon has come back to promote disharmony among the modern &quot;justice-loving&quot; werewolves.<br />For an afternoon's light read these books are good, but don't expect any great depth of character or any really new ideas. It manages 3 stars for a plesant read and because despite it's shallowness it wasn't awful.	2001-04-13

I think he is right in saying we have all lost something valuable.  Ways of living that can probabaly never truly be recaptured.<br />However, having looked up the author on the net, he seems heavily into the &quot;new age&quot; speeking circut today, despite all he was taught when he was younger.  I wonder if the written word, despised by the Maya, will be his main legacy.  And by his own admission you never get the whole story that way.  Certinally, despite the wisdom in this book it is not the be-all answer for all of life's problems.	2001-04-13

This is acutally the second book of what appears to be a loosely linked trilogy.  I haven't read the first book in the set &quot;werewolf's kiss&quot;.<br />I found that as a stand alone novel this was well written.  The author has a clear writing style and sticks to reasonalbly simple story lines.  I also found it was quite lyrical and had a bitter-sweet ending.<br />It's the story of the &quot;cursed&quot; marley werewolves.  The eldest child of each generation is cursed so that on the &quot;night of their greatest triumph&quot; they will turn into a werewolf and start killing.  Andrew Marley is the 3rd generation for this to happen to and on the night of his ordination as a preist all goes to hell.<br />The cover somewhat does this book a dis-service. It looks like a dyed-in-the-wool romance, but the story is in many ways more of a tragedy than a romance and I was grateful I found I was actually reading a story and not a torrid romance that simply revolves around love saving the day and sex.<br />If you want a &quot;light&quot; werewolf novel that is quick and easy to read this is reccomended.	2001-04-11

This is  a review of the updated 1998 edition of this book.  This book is a very interesting read on world crime.  The book details, quite correctly I imagine, the fact that the motivation behind most organised crime is one thing - MONEY!<br />The best way to hit back at organised crime is confiscate the proceeds and benifits of crime, money and assets. Unfortuntley, the criminals today are a sophisticated (at the top) as the people chasing them.  There are also many countries, who lacking other resources fall back on &quot;confidental&quot; financial services as a way to make a living. <br />In many ways it's hard to blame these smaller countries and economies going into the money laundring business as globalisation and the corporate greed of the 1st world economies marginalise &quot;traditional&quot; economies and communities.  It's a fact of life that people will make money any way they can - and if you are desperate enough you'll take the illegal or semi-illegal route.<br />This book takes you into the murky world of swiss banking - and it's NOT like the movies. Numbered bank accounts are a thing of the past.  How the columbians got shot in the foot when they set up the mexican drug trade in a fit of diversification.<br />It also details how while crime has gone global in a big way, law enforcement has only done so sparodically, and not much will change until international co-operation is better organised.<br />This book just goes to prove that you can do a lot with banks if you are willing to pay the  fees, know the world's tax havens (and their limitations) - and that cash is not always king (because then you need to go through the bother of washing it).<br />An illuminating and frightening book, which I'm sure is just the tip of the iceberg.	2001-04-08

He's found in the phone book as  a private investigator of the supernatural and he is a REAL wizard.  He's also on retainer with the police force for the 'x-file' cases that occasionally comes up.<br />When Harry is called into a double murder, where the victims died with their hearts exploding out of their chest, he gets in deeper than he ever imagined.<br />Suddenly the Chicago 'godfather' is after him, a mystery 'missing person' case turns up, the police are breathing down his neck and a black sorcerer is killing people throughout the city and Harry is the main suspect for the police and the 'white council' wizard henchman.<br />Harry is a flawed hero.  A man with a past that has many people doubting his true motives and leaves a cloud over his head.  Despite this he always does his best and he's an interesting person to read about.  This is a well written, easy to read debut novel, and I'll be happy to follow Harry's adventures into the next book.	2001-04-01

I've never read much about this period, so I was interested to find out what it was like.<br />I found it mildly entertaing in parts, but in a way repetitve.  The book is divided into sections, each dealing with a different aspect of society such as the 'bon ton', london, the seaside, the persuit of pleasure, fashion and manners.<br />In the end I found that most of the people she was writing about were very self indulgent and mostly came to a bad end. (like any regency novel).  I've also since found out that this book is not the best on accuracy which is a dissapointment.  <br />In the end I found I was skim reading this book, because I felt like I was going over the same ground over and over, and it just lost my interest.  Some books will do that to you and this one did it to me.  Such a shame as I started with high hopes for it.	2001-04-01

They have all been published to make use by students and academics easy.  Each book is full of around 100-200 decorated ancient maya vases.  Justin Kerr developed the 'roll out' method of photography to show these vases in their full glory.  <br />In the first book each photo is black and white, but each pages shows a good quality photo of the vase in full, with the design easy to see.  All these books are bound in ring binders to make them easier to use on a photocopier and are A4 paper in size.  The later issues of this series also include some colour roll-out photos.  The easiest place to obtain these books is from the author.  There are also a number of essays at the back of each of these books on subjects related to the vases by eminent Maya scholars.<br />If you are doing any research into the maya these books are invaluable.	2001-03-30

Things get INTERESTING from there on in.<br />This is an EXCELLENT sequel.  These books have been an unexpected fantasy gem.  The author writes with a sense of 'realism' rare in fantasy, and there's not a dragon, fairy or vengeful sword in sight. Refreshing. Read this to make some of the events in the first book click into place. You may get a few suprises - after all the 'lady in gil' is only 1/3rd of the story.	2001-03-22

However, an unfortunate accident by his very heroic elder brother leads him being sent to find the 'lady in gil' and save his homeland island of Gil from invaders who have held for the last 70 years.<br />Tig is great character, intelligent and sceptical of heroics - and their ability to get you killed quick.  The story is told with a realism and a regard for the consequences of actions rare in fantasy novels.  The author has also given Tig a great dry sense of humor.<br />I'm reading the second book at the moment, and it's also excellent.  So far these have been much better than your 'average' fantasy.  An author whose work I intend to keep an eye out for from now.	2001-03-21

The book is slim, as not much of her personal diary survived.  However, it does have a good introduction, including a VERY helpful picture of a court lady in her dress.  If you ever read any of these old court diaries, you come to appreciate a good picture like this because the women who wrote these books dwelled, almost obessivly on what they wore.<br />The clarity and quality of the writing is this slim volume is very good, as good as what you will find in the pillow book of sei shonagon.  This book is also a facinating read in conjuction with the latest novel by Liza Dalby &quot;the tale of Murasaki&quot;.

What comes across is a very conservative society, and if you weren't told the dates of the events taking place you would believe they were set in the 10th or 11th century.<br />The writer of this memoir is a very independant and sensual woman - who took her lovers regardless of the consequences.  The second half of the memoir details her travels around Japan's sacred shrines as a nun later in life.  Lady Nijo constantly finds on her travels that the world outside Hein-Kyoto has changed since the days the poems she learnt at court as description of Japan's famous sights were written. Some of the old 'famous' sights have gone and she finds new ones to fill their hole.<br />If you've an interest in these old Japanese diaries and memoirs, this should be added to your list.  It's a later, and lesser known book, but worth the effort of reading.	2001-03-18

I picked this book up because I'd heard somewhere that it was good. Somewhat to my suprise, I found it a funny and interesting read.  It explains some of the apparent &quot;weirdness&quot; of Star Trek conventions.

It's a light-weight read in a lot of ways, and easy and quick to get through.  If you want to get some idea of what motivates people to go to conventions that are larger than many towns (I've never been to one - but they look like worth going to in the USA, if only to see the dress-up), then pick this up.	2001-02-17

There is also a sequel called &quot;beyond Freedom&quot; by the same author. If he writes any more in this sequence I'll probably read it.  It's interesting to read a contemporary fantasy that originates in the UK and no the USA.	2001-01-25

This book is an excellent introduction to the era.<br />It deals with topics like: politics &amp; society, religions, &quot;the good people&quot;, the cult of beauty, women &amp; men, Murasaki Shikibu &amp; the tale of Genji - Japan's first novel masterpiece.<br />Before you start diving into old Japanese litrature, this is probably a good place to start as it explains in clear english some court relationships that otherwise would remain murky, no matter how good the footnotes are in the book you are reading!	2001-01-25

At the back of the book there are hundreds of illustrated items by the firm.  Most of the pictures are in colour, and the book is gorgeous, and covers everything from Imperial Easter eggs to jewllery and hardstone figures.<br />In additon to it's stunning photos the book also has as great deal of information about the firm and it's manufacturing techniqes that many other books on Faberge don't cover.<br />If you can find a copy of this book - Get it!

This book is basically all the letters of Arbella Stuart that the author could find.  They have been transcribed into readable english and presented in chronological order.  The english and spelling is not changed from the original letters, which can make them difficult to read at times, but there is no better way to get the 'flavour' of Arbella's life.<br />The author has also written a biographical introduction on Arbella Stuart's life.  This is the result of the reasearch the author has done in finding and transcribing these letters.  It is almost a new biography worth reading in itself.  Even if you find the letters hard going (like I did), the biography is worth the price of the book.<br />I've only one real complaint about this book and that is the Author's insistance on naming Arbella &quot;stuart&quot; throughout her text - she says because it's more respectful - but I think it tends to de-individualise the subject and found it grating.<br />If you have any interest in the tragic life of this lady this book is very worthwhile, and it's the first new book in *ages* on Arbella.	2001-01-24

It's quite thick at 575 pages of fine text.  It does, however, cover extremely well Elizabeth's reign and puts many of her decisions in their social context.  <br />The author has relied heavily on primary sources for this work and they give a &quot;flavour&quot; to the time Elizabeth lived in.  You end up with a good feel for Elizabeth's mercurial personality.  Her chronic indecisiveness and hatred of being forced into a decision.  The mine-field of international politics, when phones and TV didn't exist.  Second-guessing the opposition, or trying to prevent an opposition from forming.<br />For an in-depth view of Elizabeth's life, reign and era this book is up there at the top of the list, if you can take the time to read it.	2001-01-15

This is essentialy a travel book.  It won't change your life, but if you have any misconceptions about the Raj still being alive in India, this might cure you.  A great book to take on holidays, about ordinary people and how they live int in India today - a world away from western Europe and America.	2001-01-15

Josephine (or Rose, as she was called for most of her life), lived a life full of incredible changes.  She went from poor colonial outcast to an aristocratic survior of the French Revolution, to end up as Empress of the French.<br />This is not a dry biography, which is full of endless quotes. Instead, the author has researched the times Josephine lived in and tried to fill in the blanks on the situations her life choices were made in.  These &quot;guesses&quot; as to Josephine's emotional state  are made clear when not supported by direct documentry evidence.  However, they do serve to bring the empress to life in this very interesting book.<br />This is a book I enjoyed, and gave a good description of the world Josephine lived in and did it's best to give us the facts (not the fantasy) on her life.	2001-01-02

This book is not as 'dramatic' as the first novel. Instead it explores the 'practical' aspects of Ardeth's and Dimitri's adaption as vampires in the modern world.<br />In this book we are also introduced to a very old Japanese Vampire, who took centries to work out that he was not only a 'deamon' as there are no vampires in Japanese mythology to guide him.<br />The Japanese section of this book gives it a lyrical quality, while the Canadian sections with Ardith and Dimitri bring it into the modern world.<br />This book is easy to read, and enjoyable. It's more an exploration into relationships than a 'horror' novel - but then who would want their life to be a horror story all the time?, even if you were a vampire.	2000-12-25

Unfortunatley, when the author starts on about the philosphy of painting and perspective things get a bit dense and the language obscure.<br />This is not a very large book (78 pages), but it does have some interesting things to say about Elizabeth's portraits and how they would have been viewed by their makers and the people who would have viewed them in Elizabeth's lifetime.<br />The portraits delt with in this book are: 1 Elizabeth as a princess (red dress) 2.The &quot;armada&quot; portrait at woburn Abbey 3.The coronation portrait 4. Elizabeth playing the lute (a minature by Hilliard) 5 Queen Elizabeth and the 3 goddesses 6.The Darnley portrait 7. The &quot;Siena&quot; portrait 8.The &quot;ermine&quot; portrait 9. The &quot;ditchley&quot; portrait 10.The &quot;rainbow&quot; portrait.<br />There are nice illustrations of all these portraits in the centre of the book.  This book is worth a read if you want to find some of the meaning in Elizabeth's portraits, but be warned about it's shortness and wordiness.	2000-12-21

However, the biographies lack any real depth to them, and there is little new information in this book and it mostly just skims over the surface of these women's lives.  <br />The bulk of the book deals with the women of the tudor royal family.  (Mary and Elizabeth Tudor and Henry 8th's queens).  There is some discussion on the lives of non-royal women, but 95% of this book is on Royalty.<br />This book is a great introduction to the lives of Women in 16th century england, but don't get this book if you have read Extensively on 16th century england, because it primarly relies on secondary sources, and contribes very little in the way of new information.	2000-12-19

However, the author writes well enough that it is also entertaining for adults.<br />When Charlie Newell discovers a door in his barn that leads to another, pristine world, where humans never evolved, he puts a plan together.  In order to finance his plan he sells some carrier pigeons (extinct birds) to some zoos.  Things get tricky and very risky from there.<br />The author has created very sensible and intelligent characters in this book.  Despite the fact that the major characters are just out of high school they they act in many ways with more sense than many 'grown up' people.<br />The only thing that ocassionaly lets this book down is the author's love of describing 'gadgets' and processes, which can make the prose a bit dry at times.<br />Worth a read if you like 'reality' based fantasy-adventure novels.	2000-12-12

By the 3rd book the author had built up a good working point for a detective-mystery-love-vampire series.<br />This book marks a departure from the earlier novels.  The central character in this book is NOT Deidre &amp; Mitch, instead it is the daughter Deidre thought had died when she was turned into a vampire.  The Daughter, named Lily was re-born out of the grave half human-half vampire.  Now, 150 years later she is out for revenge.<br />Unfortunatley, Lily is not a likeable character, and Mitch &amp; Deidre are spilt up and made enemies in the most stupid of events. It really makes you wonder if you are reading about the same characters in the previous novels.<br />This book is a distinctly worse book than the rest of this series, and I would have been happy if the author had never written it.  <br />I guess it must be one of those novels you love or hate.  For me, after this offering I doubt I'll bother with the rest of this series. I'm happy with the first 3 books, but this one sends the series in a direction which I haven't enjoyed and I've no real desire to waste more money on characters which get butchered like this.	2000-12-08

Edith Holden, the artist of this work was a very accomplished watercolorist.  This book is filled with her views of the fruits, beauty and wonder of nature.  It shows the flowers, birds and insects of the natural world as they appear over a year accompanied by appropriate poems and quotations.<br />The watercolours are simply breathtaking. The closest thing to this book that I have seen is illuminated manuscripts, but the effect here is quite different.<br />The publishers have been very wise with publication. You get a page-by-page facimilie in full colour, reproducing the original manuscript.  They have not cluttered the book up by reproducing pages and putting their own text next to it.<br />If you run across a copy of this pick it up and let it take you away to another world.	2000-12-03

It was hard to imagine at first why this book was written and what it could cover that the first book didn't.<br />I found this book very easy to read.  It approaches Olga's remarkable life in chronological order and it never looses track of the fact that this book is about Olga's life and not that of some of her more famous relatives.<br />Olga was a very adapable woman. She was born to Czar Alexander 3rd and his wife Marie when they were on the throne of Russia.  She lived a life in palaces surrounded by servants and guards.  Despite this she always carved out an independant niche for herself and this stood her in good stead when the old russia was engulfed in revolution.<br />Olga moved from the life of a pampered princess and society woman to that of a nurse at the front line and from there to a refugee, with her family in Europe and Canada.<br />This book fills in some of the areas glossed over in Vorres book.  It deals with the later problems with her brother Michael, and the heartache her children bought her later in life. It also deals with lingering mysteries like the sale of her mother's jewels to Queen Mary of England.<br />I would have to say this is not a minute by minute account of Olga's life but it does bring her life into perspective and presents a woman who wasn't afraid to take life by the horns and run with it.  It's book worth a read, especially if you are interested in the old imperial russia or the life of refugees afterwards.	2000-12-01

Nicki Chim is forensic hematologist (a specialist in blood), who works on contract for various people, including the police department in washington DC.<br />This book chronicles both the investigation into a serial killer called 'the winter man' and Nicki's private life which is getting more complicated than she would like.  The characters are believable and the author has well thought out her sub-culture of vampires in the modern world without going into obessive detail.<br />If you like a good mystery and run across a second hand copy of this book it's worth picking up and reading.  The fact that Nicki is a vampire is in many ways almost incidental to the story, it's just something she has to 'live' with and work around.	2000-11-29

With each book you learn more about the characters in this 1930's Chicago setting.  The characters also evolve and learn from previous experience.  However, having said this, each book is a story to itself, and not a never-ending cliff-hanger.  They also have a great mix of suspense, mystery and humor.<br />In this novel Jack has finally decided to stop reacting and start acting to make his 'new' life on his terms.  To this end, he has leased an old run-down building (with money liberated from the mob in previous novels) and renovated it into his soon-to-be-opened club &quot;Lady Crymsyn&quot;.  Just when the workmen were getting to the last stages of the renovation, in the basement, Jack gets a phone call telling him of a horrible discovery.  <br />Behind a false wall in the basement the remains of a woman who had been walled up alive and left to die are found.  With the memory of his own lingering death, Jack decides to investigate to give the dead woman justice.  Jack starts stepping on some toes (including his landloard's) and things become very interesting.<br />One of the things I love about this series, is that despite being a vampire, Jack (the narrator of this series) comes across as very human.  In fact more human in someways than the mob elements he deals with on a regular basis.<br />Looking forward to the 10th book.  If you like supernatural/vampire/detective fiction this series is really worth a look at.	2000-11-25

That is until her husband, crown prince Sado was killed at his father's orders.<br />This book is an excellent translation by the author of Lady Hyegyong's memoirs.  They are a unique historical document.  They are also the first true autobiographical writings by a woman to come out of Korea.<br />The translator has used the earliest versions of these memoirs available to base his translation (oddly enough these are found in the USA, not Korea - the koreans must be annoyed over this!)<br />The memoirs were acutally written in 4 parts and the translator has preserved this breakage.  In many ways the first part (written in 1795) and the last part (written in 1805) are the most interesting sections of this book.  The first memoir movingly depicts the author being chosen as wife to the crown prince and her distress at her success.  The middle memoris of 1801 &amp; 1802 cover much of what is in the 1795 section.  These mostly elaborate on themes in the earlier one, and are principly a justification/explantion of her families 'bad luck' over the years and why it is her fault.  It also brings home the old saying that &quot;power corrupts - absoult power corrupts absolutly&quot;.<br />The last part, written in 1805 descibes the events leading up to her husbands death.  It is written with great character insight and is of great historical value. The writer was obviously a lady of intelligence. <br />This book only gets 3 stars, because while it is interesting, the middle section of the book is quite slow to get through because it is so repetitive.  Parts 1 &amp; 4 offer the real vale here.  I'm suprised no-one has written a novel of this ladies life with this great source material.	2000-11-24

It covers her life from birth till her un-looked for accension to the throne of England after the death of her brother Edward and after Lady Jane Grey was taken off the throne. <br />Better known to history as 'bloody Mary', this book details her life and dissapointments before she came to the throne.  She went from loved princess and heiress, 'the jewel of england', to Bastard and poverty stricken and unloved and forgotten daughter - all because of her father's quest for a son to succeed him on the throne.<br />This has to be one of the most accurate of historical novels I have read.  The author didn't have to invent what you read in here - most of it is pretty well documented.  Just pick up a 'serious' biography to compare it. However, the author does a great job of putting this into the emotional context and development of Mary.<br />This is the first book in a set, the other 2 books being &quot;Mary the queen&quot; and &quot;bloody Mary&quot;.  These books were originally printed in the 1970's so they are hard to find now, but worth picking up if you see them.	2000-11-05

The text mostly introduces the photographers and sets the scene (so to speek) for the photos.<br />The photos themselves are astonishing.  They are all taken between 1850 and 1912, when China was still living like it had done for the past 3 thousand years, in all it's high culture and barbarity.<br />There are photos of gorgeously attired couples in dragon robes, all formally seated like ancestor portraits.  There are also city-scapes and photos of remote temples and the Summer palace before it was burnt by the invading armies of the west.  There are scenes of executions which hide NOTHING and scenes from the imperial court and pictures of heart-breaking poverty.<br />This book is an eye-opener.  I've never seen a collection of photos like this anywhere else.  I highly reccomend this book to anybody interested in Imperial China, Costume or social history	2000-10-30

It is extremely informative about venice and has a lot of useful information.  However, I have to agree that the map can be difficult to work with at times. I got pretty badly lost using it because it did not fully list all the 'streets'(there were 2 streets of the same name in the same area - go figure).  However, My experience has been that maps in venice are dodgy at best.<br />My only real complaint about this book is it's weight.  It's quite heavy to carry in a bag when you are sightseeing - aside from that - it's a very highly reccomended book if you are researching a trip to Venice.  It's also great for re-identifying photos correctly later:)	2000-10-14

This book was interesting in the sense that it really bought home to me the vast differences in the way Japan was treated after the war to how Germany was treated.  Japan got away with a lot in that they had only minor repatriations made to other countries - and from most of the history books you'd think they never did any organised looting. (on the contrary, they were very good at it)<br />However, given that this book is ment to be about the imperial familiy of Japan, I didn't find it terribly enlightening.  Segrave complains that the familiy lives under a cloak of secrecy and has done for generations.  Unfortunatly, this book does not lift that cloak a great deal. Virtually all the sources used are second or third hand or even unsupported rumors.<br />Because of these removed sources the author has not built a very convincing or rounded portrait of any of the members of the imperial family - although he has managed to show how much recent Japanese history has been stage-managed.<br />This is almost a dull book in a way - without the consparies to liven it up it would be a very slim book indeed.	2000-10-13

I liked the main character, and she came from an interesting background.<br />However, in the end I thought this book lacked any real depth and was basically a simple love story, which is why it's only got 3 stars.  An easy read, but not one I'd probably read twice. Nothing *really* original.	2000-10-12

The main difference being instead of getting high on alchol or drugs - they get high on blood.  In the beginning of the book some of the &quot;vampires&quot; are trying to give up blood in an AA type arrangement.  They self destruct from within and from there on it's all down hill.<br />I found this a depressing book full of very self indulgent characters. In the end I didn't really care what happened to them. Let them overdose on blood and make the world a better place. Nasty I know, but that's the effect this book had on me.<br />It gets 2 stars for an original idea, but I wouldn't read any more about these people again given the choice.	2000-10-12

I can't say I've ever read another vampire book like it.  When reporter Lizzie meetes &quot;the last cowboy&quot;, Tucker, they don't know what they are getting into.  Not long after the fatal meeting Lizzie gets turned into a vampire against her will.  <br />Despite this horrible turn of events, Tucker, being a cowboy, rides to her rescue - from therein it just gets stranger and stranger.  Despite this, it is a funny and complelling read.  This is a book I'm inclined to hold onto - it's worth a second read I think.	2000-10-12

They cover the years 1909 to 1915.  Before Faberge sold an item they drew it in these ledgers in watercolour and noted all the details of the stones and materials it was made of.  <br />Many of the designs are for tiaras, fans, broaches etc.  In some cases they have been matched up with the original pieces so you get to see both the drawing and what was actually made.<br />This book is interesting for the different view it gives you of faberge objects.  It is also a new source of information.  It is not heavy on text and instead concentrates on reproducing the ledgers in colour.	2000-10-11

However, it doesn't just deal with her.  It puts her in her social context within her scheming familiy and how they delt with Royalty and the Tudor court.<br />It also gives an interesting follow up of what happened to the rest of her familiy following their ill fated bid to get Jane on the throne. It's an interesting book, all the more so because it deals with a group of people, not just Lady Jane.	2000-10-11

Despite it's age I found I really loved the show.  It has a great mix of humor along with the 'horror'.

It also includes a fully detailed episode guide and a critical evaluation of each episode.<br />For people who enjoy the night stalker or who want to know more about the show or actors/producers you can't go wrong with this excellent guide.	2000-10-11

It shows how visions of 'the exotic' in places like asia and the middle east have affected western dress over the centuries - right up to the present time.<br />This volume is illustrated with numerous lovley colour photos of the exhibition pieces, which range from the 18th to 20th centuries.  The text is quite light and easy to read, and the book does not have an index.<br />I give this book 4 stars for the photo and presentation content, but I'd have to drop one off for the text content.  It's not a big book at 95 pages, but it's a nice one:)	2000-10-11

It demonstrates how much archaeology and our knowledge of the Maya has changed since the Mayan ruins were first 'discovered' in the 19th century.  <br />The cultural biases of the early archaeoligts now explain many of the 'facts' put forward in early books on this subject.  Acutally many of these 'facts' were just guesses, but because they were put forward by prominent people they were taken on face value.  Much of the work, especially since the 1960's has disproved or changed out of recognition these early 'facts'.<br />The last overview book on the Maya I read had them as peace loving people in lovely cities in the jungle, who just &quot;gave it all up for no decent reason&quot;.  This book completly changed my view on that. It made me realise on how slim a foundation many of the earlier works lay.<br />I'd reccomend this book to anybody who wants to know how much archaeology has changed - and why what these people have discovered is not only in the past, but also has a bearing on us today..	2000-10-10

Set at the end of the T'ang dynasty (AD738)in China it shows how the dynasty fell.  Virtually all the charcters in the novel are based on historical people and the society as laid out in the novel is obviously based on a lot of research. It involves death, deception, loyalty and dishonour - and the founding of Korea as a penal state for political dissidents. (shades of Australia!)<br />This is not a quick book to read (it's quite big at 920 pages). However at the end you marvel at the author's ability to portray so well a world so long gone.  Esecially when you consider that the authors are from &quot;the west&quot; and not China.	2000-10-09

They are a complementry pair that are a beginning and end of a story, although there are different main characters in each book.  <br />I had not read these novels before I picked up this book, though I'd seen them around at some point.  They reminded me in theme and story of an earlier novel by this author called &quot;the hammer of darkness&quot;.  They all deal with the subject of timetravel, space, power and gods.<br />These books are pure fantasy. This author has an unusual writing style and creates strange worlds. I would have to say that &quot;the timegod&quot; seemed to go slower than the first book &quot;timediver's dawn&quot;.  Both are a good read if you like fantasy or this author. Value for money, with 2 books in 1.	2000-10-08

This book of hours was made by &quot;the master of Mary of Burgundy&quot; in the early 16th century. In additon to the 'carpet pages' of this manuscript, various text pages are also reproduced. Many of the illustrated pages have gold leaf on them and an gold ink is used to reproduce this effect. My only complaint with this book is that this ink has in some places obscured details of the manuscript and made pages look heavier than I think they probably do in the orginal work.<br />If you have read any books on illuminated manuscripts in the past, you might be suprised by the number of pages you will recognise in this book.  In size the book is quite small. Quite litrely the size of your palm, and this is a reflection on the actual size of the manuscript in Oxford. The publishers have tried to reproduce the facilmile as close as possible to the orginal where they could.<br />If you are interested in illumanated manuscipts this book is worth having.	2000-10-07

It is actually the correspondence between Marie Antoinette of France and her mother Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.<br />This book is interesting for a number of reasons.  It somwhat suprising how well these women expressed themselves to each other in the mail. It also brings to light some of the contraditions of Marie Antoinette's position in France.  She was exhorted by her mother to be a good frenchwoman, but in her heart to never forget that her first loyalty should always be to Austria and her.<br />Royal marriages in centuries past were made for political alliances and this always put the partner who went to a new country in a difficult position as far as loyalty went.  Marie Antoinette's solution was to start lying or not telling her mother things. Unfortuntley for her, her mother had a household spy by the name of Mercey (who went to france with marie) to report back everything she omitted. These letters are also included.<br />You end up with a well rounded picture of a young lady in deep over her head. It's a world of pomp, pain and deception.  This book is worth getting if only to see a completly different view of these people than you would get out of a formal biography....their life in their own words.	2000-10-07

This is a beautiful exhibition catalogue that shows how movies depict historical and SF costume.  It is full of beatiful illustrations from the movies being discussed and also has examples of the actual costume worn in that movie.<br />What is very interesting is in the historical sections. You can clearly see how *wrong* these costumes are. Superfically they look right - but that's about it. Even 'gone with the wind' has it's problems.<br />There is also a section on SF movies and how the costuming in those are affected by what people are wearing at the time they are made.  Out of this section the movies that seem to have stood the test of time the best are 'bladerunner' and 'flash gordon 1980'.<br />This is a very interesting book for people who are interested in the movies and costume.	2000-10-06

Each print out of these collectors editons are produced in sequence, along with notes from his diary.  The author of this book has also included notes on each temple/monument and it's history.  Alongside David Roberts prints are modern colour photos showing the same site today.<br />This is an illuminating book.  It shows how much the egyptian monuments have changed in the last 150 years. Not always for the better.  The island of philae is shown with it's monuments all brightly coloured with the orginal paint.  Today they have been stripped bare back to the stone by the waters of the Aswan dam.<br />Many of the monuments Roberts shows in here are partially covered by sand and it is interesting to see how different they look when they have been fully excavated, or in the case of the nubian monuments - quite literally picked up and moved.<br />For anybody interested in ancient egypt, 19th century travel or lovely monumental art this book is a must.  This is also the best place to see these prints for most people as the cost of the original prints these days is wildly expensive. You get the beauty without the cost...	2000-10-06

Kirk is now DDO at the CIA and is now settling down. He is back with his ex-wife Kathleen and his daugher Elizabeth is also in the CIA.<br />Things start to unravel for Kirk when the negotiations with a Terrorist in Afganistan go bad and he has to intervene personally.  The terrorist's take away Kirk's traking device and Washington assumes the worst and hit the terrorist encampment with missiles.  From therin it's downhill and the terrorists have a nuclear weapon they bought from a disintergating soviet republic.....<br />I enjoy these Kirk McGarvey novels of David Hagberg.  Like all adventure novels they are a bit unbelievable, but Hagberg does a good job with his characterisations and his bad guys are generally well written and his plots move at a good pace.<br />I don't know anything about weapons, so I never noticed the previous reviewers problems.  Unless you know weapons you wouldn't spot these problems. But he does have a point. Hagberg could probably do a bit more reasearch here, especially when you consider the author's photo on the back cover of the book!<br />This book ends on an interesting note and it sets the scene for the next book in this series.  These books are a good alternative to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan.	2000-09-23

It's main character Mercer is a genius geologist- engineer who can outfight any commando on the planet with just four weeks training from 10 years ago. This book lost all credibity for me as far as plot went when Mercer was escorted to the White House for a 'who's, who' meeting, with everybody fawning over him, despite the fact that Mercer had just been killing people left, right and centre all over Washington.<br />It also strained the imagination that Hawaii could even think of breaking away from the USA without the Media going into a frenzy over it.  They would have eaten the president of the time alive and that would have been a story in itself.  <br />The characters in this book strike me as being quite naieve and one dimensional.  This is a good book to read if you want to put your mind into neutral.  Just don't give any thought to what you're reading and you'll get to the end of this happy.	2000-09-23

I was looking forward to a conclustion of this series with this book. My heart sank when I saw how thick the book was and when I then saw there was a 4th book coming... <br />Then I started reading the book. With this installment the author seems to have lost her sense of balance with story telling. Most of this book (3/4) seems to be about Mikhyel and his tangled relationships. In the end I gave up on this book. I got sick of reading about the great Mikheyl, because what I actually enjoyed about the first 2 books was the sense of balance and growth of all the three brothers Mikheyl, Deymoran and Nikki.<br />I won't be reading any more of this series. It's been a real dissapointment because it started out so well and now it's just rambling. What ever happended to a well written TRILOGY?? It's a rare beast these days.	2000-09-03

In many ways that was true.  Louis built Versilles to be the new heart of  France. One where *he* ruled absoultley to the glorie of France.<br />However,  this book covers much more than Versilles.  You get to see what the  majority of France was like during the period outside the court.  Why the  country was loathed by all courtiers, the real definition of a stinking  Paris.  How to get caught out at dinner for wrong ettiqute.  Why you  *didn't* want to end up on the Galleys and what your chances of education  would have been like.<br />The author makes it clear that it is hard to make  generalisations about this period in France, but he does his best to give  us examples of the confusion and differences people experienced during the  period.<br />If you think our taxes are bad today.  Read this book and thank  your lucky stars you aren't living in 17th cent France.<br />All in all this  is a very enlightening read and highly recommended to anybody who wants a  real glimpse of what the *real* France was like under Louis 14th.	2000-08-30

The book was well paced and the characters showed both growth and intelligence.  Davy's life is not an easy one.  His  father is an alcholic and violent man, and his mother left him and Davy  when her husband almost killed her.<br />Then one day Davy makes an amazing  discovery.  He can teleport!  It doesn't solve all his problems, but it  does give him a freedom the rest of us can only dream about.  If you ever  wanted your own transporter beam - well, this guy has it.<br />The latter half  of the book made me glad that terroist actions on public transport are  quite rare these days, and I would have hated to live through the rash that  Davy went through at the end. That was the only part of the book that kind  of jarred with me.  That *so many* terroist actions took place in such a  short period.<br />Aside from that, these characters really do grow on you and  easily carry you to the end of the novel.	2000-08-30

Beware of the 'other rememberances' in this book's  title, because they, not lillie, take up the bulk of the book.<br />Buy this  if you are interested in a series of biographies on dis-seperate, but  ground breaking women - don't buy it if you want an interesting book on  Lillie Langtry, because in the end it's not really about her, despite the  title.	2000-07-14

It depicts a Queen Elizabeth quite different in some ways from other biographies I have read of her.  I found it memorable because what we are shown here is why Elizabeth was  'different' to her contempoary women.<br />Elizabeth was a loud, demanding  woman with a temper. Regal in all she did, she did not gain her strengths  by behaving like a man, but by concentrating what made her unique.  She was  TUDOR to her fingertips and proud of the fact, and her vulernbilty because  she was a woman without an heir was camoflagued in many cases by her  personality.<br />A worthwhile read in my view if only to get a different  slant on this facintating woman.	2000-05-15

These letters were never meant to  be seen by anybody else and they give an insight into her character  that  is available from few other sources.<br />Lillie was the first of the  'supermodels' and the topic of this book is how the 'real' lillie delt with  sudden fame in the hot house of manners and morals that was victorian high  society.  Lillie succeded on a grand scale, but read this book to find out  what success cost her.<br />If you are at all interested in Lillie Langtry  this most recent of books is a must.	2000-04-29

This is one series that really stands out.  It's a real mix of european and north american myth, set in an ice age.  The end of an age of magic,gods and myth, but with a solid 'reality'  base.<br />I've read this series more than once, and I still think it's great.  Pick it up if you can and read it.  It's worth it.	2000-04-25

Aside from his 'anvil of ice' series, this is the work of Michael Scott Rohan that I like the best.  It's about a series of mis-matched characters who get together to save the world in an alternate reality.<br />I got to the  end of this book and wished for a second book to read more of these  characters, because the characters grow and change with the length of the  novel and I would love to see the continuation of that growth.  Come on  guys - get your act together and give us another book!	2000-04-25

I found that while the author had some informtion I hadn't read before about the times, and the people, she lost the plot on who she was writing about.  <br />This book can go for  chapters at a time, barley mentioning the 'sisters' of Henry. Instead you  find you are reading a life of Henry 8th.  While Henry was important in the  life of these women, it would have been more relvant if it was related  directly back to his sisters. Perhaps the book would have been better if  both sister lives were delt with independantly, since after childhood they  had little to do with each other.	2000-04-23

Well written and researched and thoughtfull.  Men have the blood and glory in the west, but it was the women who kept the home hearths buring and gave the society the men lived  in some meaning.<br />This was equally true for both indians and white man and  this book beautiflly illustrates it - as well as teaching you much you  probably never knew and probably never gave thought to before.<br />Very  highly reccomended.	2000-03-23

She is a Marshal on the police force of distict one in the new world order.  It's a world of diminished natural resources, dictotorship, corruption and grinding poverty and  flurshing 'invisible magic'.<br />Ty is also a werewolf as a result of an  accident which left her with weird brain damage. The author has taken an  original approach with this aspect of ty's life.<br />In this novel ty and her  partner andy take on the office of 'intelligence'a sink hole of weirdo's  and the home of 'invisible magic'.<br />If you like detective stories and sf,  and horror, I reccomend this series.  This is the 3rd book in the  'moon'series, with these characters.  In addition the author has also  written 2 other titles with 'file' in the title with these people. <br />Worth  a read.	2000-02-28

It's a memorable and haunting book, with characters that have an interesting mix of the mysterious and sympthatic.  I've read a lot of time travel books before, but really nothing like this.<br />If you can it a copy it's a good read.	2000-02-24

I didn't know about the La Nauge chronicles before the other reviewer mentioned it, but the short story prior to this one with the same  main character &quot;the terry&quot; is good, but not as good as this book.   <br />Really worth a read if you run across a second hand copy.	2000-01-08

Like the other reviewer said, the main character is no saint, with a less than savoury past, but you are cheering  for him at the end, because there is much worse than him around -  especially on this train.<br />A recomended read if you run across it second  hand.	1999-12-14

I think Terry Goodkind has finally lost the plot and is doing a Robert Jordan on us.  Wandering all over the countryside,  and putting elaboration in for the sake of it.  <br />This book could do with  some serious editing.  I would have liked to see a tighter story, that  progressed the plot more than one millimeter.<br />This is the last book I  will be reading in this series, it seems never ending.	1999-12-08

I'd reccomend these books to anybody who enjoys the 'vampire-detective' genre.  A subset of the vampire genre, which  for me  which started with these books, and remains my favourite theme in this  area.  <br />I'd love to read some more books with Gareth in them.  My only  dissapointment with these books was that there hasn't been more in the  series.	1999-11-03

I have to say it's lived up to the reviews.  I loved it.  One of the best vampire novels I  have read.  Great characters, funny and suspensful in a way.  I'll read it  again.  I hope the author writes another novel with these people in it  (hint, hint)	1999-10-28

I thought 'komarr' was quite a flat and unfunny book by this author, but this book has to be the funniest in the series and one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  Really worth buying.

I had hoped he would wrap it up in 3-4 books, but like 'the eye of time' series it is dragging on and on and on.  Very little progress really  seems to have been made by the end of this book and I doubt I'll be buying  more in this series.  All in all a dissapointment.	1999-09-02

I wasn't dissapointed.  Both titles are one of the best reads I have had in a long time.  A  contempoary fantasy that has great characters. You won't want to put either  book down. I am looking forward to more books with these characters from  this author.  <br />I read a lot of SF, Fantasy and horror and these titles  really do stand out from the crowd.
