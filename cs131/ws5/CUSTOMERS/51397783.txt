The concept that there are interested groups after secrets suppressed for centuries, secrets that can bring down modern-day Christianity with all the possible repercussions forms a solid plot for the action. Once one has read a conventional thriller and knows `whodunnit' the book is pass&eacute;. But when it makes you think of other issues and pick up other books to explore some of the concepts raised, the book becomes more than a run-of-the-mill thriller - and this book falls in that category. Another book of fiction of note is Gore Vidal's `Julian' (about the nephew of Constantine the Great who wanted to revert to the old pagan religions from the newly established Christianity). After finishing \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" the question that lingers on is: how much is fact and how much is fiction?  For those who are interested in pursuing this, some good books to start with are Bart Ehrman's \\"Lost Christianities,\\" John Shelby Spong's \\"Born of A Woman\\" and \\"This Hebrew Lord,\\" and Marcus Borg's \\"The Heart of Christianity.\\"	2004-04-03

But the organization you work for may be different from the ones profiled, and it is a debatable point if those conclusions can work as effectively in your setting. But in this book, the authors have profiled 80,000 managers over 25 years from all kinds of companies -- from humble start-ups to established, Fortune 500 giants. This makes their observations and conclusions very interesting.  A thought provoking book.	2000-11-29

She delved into the world's great  religious and philosophical writings, but became convinced that to realize  the truth, you needed a guide who had already \\"been there and done that.\\"   In 1925, she met the great Indian saint and spiritual leader, Paramahansa  Yogananda when he was in Seattle. Later, she joined his monastic order and  took the name of Gyanamata (\\"Mother of Wisdom\\"). This book is a summary of  her life and also contains many of her writings - journal entries, letters  she wrote to Yogananda (and ones she received from him), counsel she gave  to other truth seekers and so forth. Her inspiring writings cover the gamut  - right attitude, devotion, renunciation, loyalty, dealing with suffering,  gratitude, and much more.  We learn so much by reading this book, and also  realize why the author was called \\"Mother of Wisdom.\\"  A veritable gem.	2000-08-07

He is ponderous and verbose a great part of the  time. But the reader who persists is richly rewarded. According to  Stendahl, Kierkegaard ignored most philosophical questions, or rather,  approached them from unconventional angles and therefore one must be  familiar with his indirect method of exposition to get the most from his  writings. In the first three chapters, she gives background biographical  material and then provides summaries of the thought in some of  Kierkegaard's major works such as Fear and Trembling and Either/Or. These  are not a substitute for reading Kierkegaard directly. But for those who  have read his books, they are good review summaries.  For those who feel  daunted by Kierkegaard, they can act as appetizers to get you to go for his  books.	2000-08-07

There's Miss Poole, the  headmistress, a colonial born in Africa who does not care for England and  continues to stay on even as independence for this African nation means  lowered standards for whites like themselves. There's Bettyjean (B.J.)  Lebow, a peace corps worker from San Diego, who struggles hard to match her  fantasies of Africa with the realities. There's her room-mate, Pam Male.  And finally Heather Monkhouse, who has had some sort of trouble in Nairobi  and taken up teaching at this remote school. When finally two black men go  out on a date with two of the teachers, a trail of tragedy engulfts each of  the teachers' lives. The writing is uneven in patches (this was one of the  author's early novels), but there are flashes of black humor.  The funniest  parts include scenes of the teachers taking turns in hosting group dinners  at each of their homes although they cannot stand one another, each trying  to outdo the other in being a rude and poor hostess.	2000-08-07

Kierkegaard's life was what biographers might call uneventful.   He was a theologian who lived all his life in a small town in Europe  (Copenhagen) in the early 19th century, died a bachelor at 42, authored  many philosophical and theological works, and virtually unknown outside of  Denmark in his lifetime and for decades after his death. Yet today his life  is studied because he was so influential to the movement in which many  other great thinkers are said to belong (Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre, Buber,  Camus and Nietzsche). Thompson goes into a fairly good detail of  Kierkegaard's life (and Kierkegaard does not always come across as a  likeable man). But he falls short when he tries to show us how  Kierkegaard's life generated his thought - at least, to people who are not  familiar with some or all of Kierkegaard's works.  In this respect,  Stendahl's \\"Sren Kierkegaard\\" is the better book where the biographical  material is brief but enough to relate to the good summaries of  Kierkegaard's books that follow.  Also, Vardy's &quot;Kierkegaard,&quot;  though limited in scope, offers a good introduction of life and thought for  somebody unfamiliar with this philosopher.	2000-08-07

The  definition and exploration of this problems is philosophy.  With this  introduction, Russell discusses some problems: the physical world, man from  without (environment), man from within (consciousness, emotions, ethics  etc) and so on. An outline is clearly limited, and Russell does not include  many branches of philosophical enquiry such as metaphysical inquiry and  some aspects of authority and state. But within its constraints, the book  is still a good read.	2000-08-03

The similarities and surprises that another  culture can provide are described in this book by University of Iowa  journalism professor Kenneth Starck who spent a year in China teaching  journalism to Chinese students in the mid 1980s. Besides the differences in  the U.S and Chinese news media and the perplexities they cause in teaching,  Starck also describes his forays into China with his wife and daughter.  Besides the obvious (a visit to the Great Wall), there are also little  delightful episodes; one such is when an inspector on a train demanded that  Starck's daughter hand over her Walkman cassette player, and slipped on the  headphones to check what kind of music the American girl was listening too.

He was not only a  scientist but also a Sufi mystic, and his Rubaiyat (book of verses in  quatrains) has evoked much interest and endless debate. The best known  English translation is that of Edward FitzGerald. Here is a sample  verse:<br />&quot;Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough / A Flask of  Wine, a Book of Verse---and Thou / Beside me singing in the Wilderness ---  /<br />And Wilderness is Paradise enow.&quot;/<br />Whose imagination can fail to  be stirred? But most people see this as a glorification of wine, women and  song -- a handbook of hedonism. Could such an earthy and earthly book be in  keeping with Khayyam's reputation as a Sufi mystic and a saint? Now towards  the end of the millennium, the Indian saint, mystic and spiritual leader  Paramahansa Yogananda has commented on the Rubaiyat in his book &quot;Wine  of the Mystic.&quot;  Omar was indeed a mystic. The divine intoxication of  the love and joy of God could only be conveyed to the people of his age  through metaphors and allegory that described the pleasures they could  understand. One must read the Rubaiyat in conjunction with &quot;Wine of  the Mystic&quot; to really get to the heart and soul of one of the world's  classic books.	2000-08-02

This book not only has essays, but the text of talks he gave on the BBC. The topics are wide and  disparate. He begins with books (and their authors) that made a deep  impression on him while he was in his formative years. Then follow essays  on politics, starting off with &quot;What is Freedom?&quot; and &quot;What  is Democracy?&quot; -- two basic questions that many people don't even  think about. The &quot;Divertissement&quot; section contains pieces of  fiction. Russell stated that he found fiction a useful medium to express  ideas he half-believed in, but had no firm grounds for belief. The last  section is on &quot;Peace and War,&quot; and includes the famous Vienna and  Manchester addresses on nuclear bombs. His style is incisive and pithy as  usual. If you like Russell, you should not miss reading this book.	2000-07-26

This is poetry that evokes all the feelings that make us human,  such as love, devotion, faith and aspirations for that which is noble.

Lang found that the lack of clear understanding of statistics by non-statisticians affected the clarity of their writing. Physicians had the  same problem while writing up their research papers for publication. Lang  perceived a need among medical and science writers to understand just  enough of biostatistics to make them better writers and editors without  becoming statisticians themselves. He devised workshops that were conducted  by the American Medical Writers Association which were enormously  successful. The logical next step was to write this book based on the  valuable teaching experience and feedback he got at those courses. In other  words, this is a book that wasn't written in a vacuum but is the result of  a perceived need, and the author's experience in meeting that need.  Co-author Michelle Secic has also contributed with her expertise, making it  a valuable book for people in this field.	2000-07-19

The Gita must surely be one of the shortest scriptures in the world -- it has only 700 two-line verses.  Yet in those 700 verses lies an unlimited wealth of wisdom. However, most  people only see a pot of water, some sense there is more to it, but it  takes a person of realization to draw out the ocean from the pot. The Gita  has been debated down the centuries in India, and in the West since the  first European language translations appeared in the 18th century. However,  scholars and theologians who only analyze it with the intellect have often  been baffled with the text. For instance, some verses of the Gita's later  chapters sometimes apparently contradict what was said earlier. When a  saint or a sage comments on the Gita, it is a different story. There is no  contradiction; obscure lines are explained with a simplicity that is  brilliant. <br />Many sages such as Adi Shankaracharya have left us their  commentaries, and now the grand tradition is kept up by the scintillating  commentary of Paramahansa Yogananda, one of the spiritual giants of the  20th century. With deep perception, Yogananda explains how the dialogue  between Krishna and Arjuna that occurred on a battlefield in a bygone  millennium is as relevant in the here and now to you and me as it was to  people way back then. The ancient warriors are an allegory to the battle of  life -- that tug-of-war in our bodies, minds and souls with different  forces pulling us in different directions. It shows how the Gita is a  blueprint for emerging victorious. The numerous cross-references to the  Holy Bible underline the contention that truth is, in essence, one -- the  various religions just state it differently. This is surely one of the  greatest commentaries ever written on the Bhagavad Gita; it is a book for  the ages.	2000-06-30

People with long memories might remember that when Alex Haley's &quot;Roots&quot; was released, he was sued for plagiarism. Haley settled out of court when it was shown that entire passages in &quot;Roots&quot;  seemed lifted almost verbatim from Harold Courlander's &quot;The  African.&quot; (Haley said that his research assistants had given him the  material without citing the source.) In any case, &quot;Roots&quot; went on  to make literary and television history while &quot;The African&quot; seems  to have disappeared from the scene. Thanks to &quot;Roots&quot; and all the  planatation novels that followed, the story line of &quot;The African&quot;  is now familiar and somewhat predictable: Hweshuhunu, a twelve year old boy  is caught in a slave raid, transported by ship in a horrific sea voyage to  America, and sold to the Blair plantation. There are scenes of plantation  life, white masters interacting both kindly and cruelly towards their  slaves and so on. <br />But there are interesting vignettes in the book, such  as the way the slaves try to hold on to their old African traditions even  as they are forcibly being &quot;Americanized&quot; every day.  There is a  connection with these slaves and the modern day immigrants who also try to  hold on to customs of their original country. In an unfamiliar country, the  newcomer tries to construct the familiar, even if it is something as simple  as placing in the new home a picture or knick-knacks that are a link to the  past. For slaves whose &quot;immigration&quot; was forced and who had  nothing (in some cases, not even their clothes), trying to hold on to the  old ways is the only way to construct the familiar. The author is  well-versed in African customs (see his other books like &quot;The Cow Tail  Switch,&quot; &quot;The Fire on the Mountain,&quot; and &quot;The Hat  Shaking Dance&quot;) -- and the reminiscences and rituals in the slave  cabins are a touching part of the narrative.	2000-04-22

The author, veteran journalist and scholar Rajmohan Gandhi (incidentally, also a  grandson of Mahatma Gandhi) holds that two dominant threads run through  Indian history -- revenge and reconciliation. He cites the Mahabharata (the  ancient Indian classic about the Kurukshetra Civil War) as exemplifying the  desire for revenge, providing examples such as the slaying of Drona and his  son Asvatthamma's vengeance. The Buddha's teachings are portrayed as an  influence for the reconcilers who came later on. Having thus set the stage,  Gandhi then takes the reader on a journey through Indian history -- ancient  India, Islamic India, British India and the post-independent India --  examining events and the thinking of various leaders through the lens of  revenge and reconciliation. Pakistan, Bangaldesh and Sri Lankan history is  also touched upon, but the focus is on India. Obviously one book cannot  cover all the history of the Indian subcontinent and the author has to be  selective, but he has done a fine job; events right upto the 1999  Indo-Pakistani skirmish at Kargil (Kashmir) are touched upon. This is a  stimulating read. A familiarity with Indian history will definitely help  the reader, but even other readers will learn something by reading this  book.	2000-04-12

You can  read about such items as the London surgeon Robert Liston who prided  himself on being quick and amputated a leg under 2 1/2 minutes (and the  fingers of his assistant as well), about Sir William Lane who was so  obsessed with constipation that he began to remove his patients' large  intestines the way others removed appendixes, and how Britain developed an  anthrax bomb to combat Hitler's Germany. But while many anecdotes  themselves make for hilarious or shocking reading, after a while they begin  to grate a bit. Although grouped into sections, there does not seem a  strong unifying thread. Perhaps the book might have more appeal if read in  installments rather than from cover to cover.	2000-04-04
