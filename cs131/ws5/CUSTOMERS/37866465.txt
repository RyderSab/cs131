Belinda Swanson and her two best friends are driving home from a forbidden April Fool's Day party when Belinda's friend, Frank, decides to \\"play a little joke.\\" He chases after a car on a narrow road, and they're sure they've caused an accident when they find the car crashed in an embankment. Belinda is the only one who's desperate to help, but the others steer her away. To make matters worse, Belinda is sure she saw someone standing at the top of the hill, watching them! Soon after, sickening pranks begin, and Belinda can't help but fear for her life! <br />I thought that \\"April Fools\\" was an awesome story by Richie Tankersley Cusick, as usual! Richie's birthday is April 1st, believe it or not, which added a unique element to the book. The storyline was nicely formatted, resembling \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" yet a bit hard to get into. I still think it deserves four stars. Every book has at least one minor flaw! Still, it's ending was unexpected and shocking, which is a must for thrillers! Richie Tankersley Cusick is an awesome writer, and I feel that this is among her best, alongside \\"Someone at the Door\\" and \\"Starstruck.\\" Happy reading!<br />Also recommended:<BR>a.) \\"Someone at the Door\\" by Richie Tankerlsey Cusick<BR>b.) \\"Starstruck\\" by Richie Tankersley Cusick<BR>c.) \\"Vampire\\" by Richie Tankersley Cusick<BR>d.) \\"The Train\\" by Diane Hoh<BR>e.) \\"Slay Bells\\" by Jo Gibson<BR>f.) \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" by Jo Gibson<BR>g.) \\"Double Date\\" by Sinclair Smith<BR>h.) \\"The Invitation\\" by Diane Hoh<BR>i.)

Melissa is urged to compete in Westdale High's first homecoming in 25 years by her friends, Izzy and Celeste. At first, Melissa's anxious to start campaigning, however, her spirits are dampened when the news of why Westdale hasn't had a homecoming until now gets around to her. Apparently, homecoming queen Brenda Sheldon had an accident on the night of homecoming. Rumor has it that her ghost is still seen around town, wanting to reclaim her crown. After a brief scare, Melissa overlooks the talk, until terrible accidents start occurring to the others running for the title; two barely missing Melissa! Who's doing this, and why? The answer is revealed in the exciting conclusion!.....<br />\\"Homecoming Queen\\" by John Hall was amazing! Mystery and suspense seems to wrap you up in an exciting blanket, nonstop! It was one of the few books that actually gave me chills. It is nicely descriptive, with a killer-surprise ending! The only flaw for me personally, was that I had previously read a book, \\"My Bloody Valentine,\\" that was similar to this book, which took a little originality out of it for me! If you haven't read that book, though, you should be fine!

She felt that he was fake, and acted overly-nice. Still, nothing prepared her for what she saw on TV one night while everyone was gone. She never expected to see the face of her stepfather on the \\"Fugitives from Justice\\" show, wanted for the murder of his wife and stepdaughter fifteen years ago! How can she prove to herself that he did -- or didn't -- do it? Everyone thinks that he's the nicest man to ever walk the face of the earth! Most of all, what happens if -- or when -- he suspects her of snooping around his past? He would have to be crazy to try to come after her, right? Then again, has he been all along? <br />I thought that \\"The Stepdaughter\\" by Carol Ellis was one of the best books I've ever read! Every chapter kept you on the edge of your seat!

Not only is it a book, it's a type of collector's package, including a giant, 104-page picture book, Mexico City super-poster, and \\"Three Days in Mexico\\" DVD! The book is absolutely beautiful. The photos seem candid, and the commentary from Brit's mom, aunt, sister, and cousin is a great, unique idea! The DVD is even better. Starting from the moment Britney leaves the hotel to the concert venue, until she leaves -- three days later -- it documents Britney's thoughts, comments, and actions. In fact, this is done so smoothly that you can barely even tell there are cameras there. It features Britney testing out the \\"I Love Rock - N - Roll\\" moving stage for practice, backstage chatting before the shows, eating in her hotel room, talking with a psychic, holding a press conference, and so much more! It includes 20 DVD chapters, and small, teaser concert clips (I wish there were full videos of the concert; that was the best part). <br />With all Britney has gone through in 2002, it was really generous of her to allow them to document her Mexico visit, even with all the bad press surrounding it. Britney * was forced * to leave the show early, due to * lightning hitting the stage * and monsoon-type raining. She came with full intent on performing a full show, but the weather did not allow that! The DVD will clear up the whole issue completely! Don't hesitate to buy it!	2003-01-01

In addition, everyone else thinks that he's the best man to ever walk the face of the earth! One night, while her mother and stepfather are out, Livvie stumbles across the \\"Fugitives from Justice\\" TV show. She thinks nothing of it until she sees a very familiar face across the screen -- her stepfather's! He's wanted, under a different name for the murder of his wife and stepdaughter! How can Livvie prove that her stepfather is a madman? No one will believe her; they'll think she's going over the edge! Still, somehow, someway, Livvie must do it. Of course, there is the minor detail of her stepfather coming after her, stopping her from exposing him. He'd have to be crazy to try to get rid of her, too! Right? Then again, he'd have to be all along!......<br />I thought that \\"The Stepdaughter\\" was very nice. It wasn't your average stalker-type thriller -- it was unique. The only downfall would have to be the first half of the book. It takes time to get into, and the author crams the events into the last 20 pages or so.

There is a big snowstorm on its way, and they've heard that if the power is to go out, it can take weeks to restore it! Still, they aren't worried about being home alone until their parents call to tell them that they're snowed-in at the airport. The call from their parents and the news brief that an escaped killer is headed in their direction is the last two things they hear before the electricity goes out. Then, in the middle of the night, the two sisters get a knock on their door! Two wounded, half-frozen strangers stand in their doorway, asking to stay the night. Of course (for protection, according to them), they refuse to leave in the morning, and strange things occur. The dog disappears, along with their axe, and the girls realize they don't know the guys at all!<br />I thought that \\"Someone at the Door\\" was unbelievable! Richie Tankersley Cusick (one of the best horror writers out there) concocts a story full of mystery and horror. The scenery adds to the suspense; two girls, miles away from anyone, helpless. The events were thrilling and surprising, and the ending was shocking. A must-read for all horror fans!<br />Also recommended:<BR>a.) \\"Starstruck\\" by Richie Tankersley Cusick<BR>b.) \\"Vampire\\" by Richie Tankersley Cusick<BR>c.) \\"Secret Santa\\" by D. E.

Sarah is stunned when she receives an invitation to the biggest party of the year. The hostess -- Cass Rockham -- doesn't even know Sarah! She's not part of the \\"in\\" crowd, nor very popular. So why is she and four of her friends invited? Something doesn't seem right to Sarah, but, because of her friends' anxiousness, decides to attend. The party gets off to a weird start when they play a game of musical chairs. One by one, each of Sarah's friends conveniently lose and are whisked off for a \\"consolation prize.\\" But, why aren't they returning? Soon, Sarah's the only one left, and, she too, is separated from the party. Her question is answered when she is locked in a secret room, all by herself.

Filled with thrilling rides, good food, and sales-booths, the carnival promises a fun time! Unfortunately, the fun turns to horror when Tammy Peters buys a pair of ruby-red shoes at a mysterious booth at the back of the field. The saleswoman hastily sells Tammy the shoes, warning her that they are cursed. When you wear them \\"you'll be given incredible fortune, but unfortunate luck.\\" Tammy dismisses the claims, yet Donna is uneasy. Tammy wears the shoes for the school play and mysteriously breaks her leg backstage. Did Tammy fall victim to the evil curse? Where are the shoes now? Claiming their next victim? Who's next?.....<br />I thought that \\"Dance of Death\\" was a pretty good book. The story claims to be a thriller, yet I found that it wasn't very thrilling. I thought that it would want you to think that the shoes were at fault, but it turns out that an actual person is behind the accidents. Unfortuantely, that wasn't the case. The shoes really were cursed, and I don't care for those types of stories. I like horror/stalker-type stories, and this was more of a sci-fi book. Also, Jo Gibson's writing style is so repetitive it's uncanny! Every other page has someone blushing, and one of the scenes mimicked a scene out of one of her other books. I had deja vu! Overall, the story was good, but isn't one I'd recommend often! Instead, for a real scare, I'd recommend \\"Slay Bells\\" about a group of people stranded in a mall with a twisted killer in their midst, or \\"My Bloody Valentine.\\" I've written reviews for both of these stories!

Hamilton High will be having a Valentine's Day Dance in honor of the popular \\"lover's-day.\\" To add to the excitement, they'll be voting on a king and queen for the event. Everyday at during lunch, students can buy cards for the one they want to win. That way, the school can make a profit for library books. Amy Hunter and her friends are all competing for the title, yet one girl stands out from all the rest -- Tanya. Tanya has the lead over everyone and she thinks life couldn't get any better. That is until she starts receiving valentines from an unknown student at Hamilton. Inside are poems that warn Tanya to be faithful and worthy of being queen, or else she's better off dead. Tanya dismisses the warnings until she's found dead. It was all an accident, according to the police, but how can anyone be sure? After Tanya's death, another girl takes the lead, and also becomes cocky about it. Just like Tanya, she receives ominous messages, and -- just like Tanya -- she dies. Too bad for Amy. After each girl gets murdered, she's put more and more in the lead. Increasing her chances more and more of having a tragic \\"accident.\\"<br />I thought that \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" by Jo Gibson was fabulous! It was filled with twists and turns around every corner, and kept you guessing until the end! These factors gave me a good impression, however I didn't like the way Gibson repeats her writing style. Like many of her other stories, the chapters alternate between the main character and the killer. Every other page has the main character blushing about something, and that starts to get annoying! Also, the author tends to use the same word over and over again -- \\"incredibly.\\" That gets to be repetitive. While the plot was entertaining, it wasn't original, which weighed down on my rating. Other than that, it was an awesome book. Read it!<br />Also recommended:<BR>a.) \\"Secret Santa\\" by D. E.

The mall will be opening shortly, and all workers must prepare for the grand opening. After hours of preparation, the police come to advise them of a winter storm. After the cops arrange driving situations, there are still people who need a ride home. Eight friends give up their vehicles and decide to wait-out the storm at the mall. They use a furniture store for sleeping purposes, and restaurants are open to them, care of management, for food. They think that things couldn't get any better until someone in the group is found dead. Was it an accident, or is someone out to get them? The question is answered very quickly when another person is found....The phones are dead, and each person receives ominous messages....Who's doing this, and who will be next?<br />I thought that \\"Slay Bells\\" was very entertaining! Reading it within a few hours definitely added to the on-going suspense! The storyline was very original, and so were the murders. Also, I like how it was different from most other thrillers. Instead of starting off with the suspense, it had foreshadowing, which didn't rush the book, like most other thrillers. Even though it was strong in those areas, it lacked logically. How coincidental that all the people that the murderer wanted to kill were the ones stranded at the mall? Also, the way the friends disposed of the bodies were very radical, and didn't seem to have a long-term shock on any of the friends until the third murder! Still, the book deserves five stars for originality and suspense, which is the main purpose of a thriller, right?.....<br />a.) \\"The Train\\" by Diane Hoh<BR>b.) \\"Secret Santa\\" by D. E.

I love Richie Tankersley Cusick, but this story is her weakest one so far. It didn't hold my interest at all, and the ghostly scenery didn't intrigue me. While there were a couple thrilling parts, they weren't very shocking or surprising....Cusick just incorporated too many ghost stories, which I didn't like.

Will she survive long enough to find out?.....<br />\\"Vampire\\" was a very good book, and up to par with a great author -- Richie Tankersley Cusick. This was my second book by her, and it was great! Keeping that in mind, it did have a few flaws. It was a bit hard to get into, and didn't get straight to the point. Aside from that, it wasn't too fast-paced. The ending (being the most important part of a book -- especially in mysteries) was satisfying, but not completely shocking -- like most other books. Still, it was unique how the author made you change your mind three times about who the killer was before they were revealed.	2002-10-30

For once, the culprit shocked me! I remember saying to myself before the ending, \\"It'd be so ironic if the stalker turned out to be __________.....\\" Sure enough, it did! Plus, the stalker's motive was genuine and realistic. Not petty. Apparently, this book isn't getting enough promotion, seeing that I'm the first person to review it after it's been out for a year. Maybe because everyone knows that D. E. Athkins' books are all out of print (except this one), they don't bother to check to see if there are any new ones.

I'm a thriller fanatic, and out of all of the books I've read so far, this is the best! From the first chapter to the last, it's suspenseful. The storyline and setting is unique, in numerous ways. For one, in most thrillers, life-threatening events occur, but there usually isn't an actual death or murder. There was in this book, which turned out to be sad, because it was one of the main characters, and after reading, you get attached and feel like you've lost a friend! Secondly, most books don't completely shock you at the end. You usually suspect everyone to a certain extent. But, the killer in \\"The Train\\" was totally unexpected!

The town has a new one built, but Sheila Keene is a member of the Women of Heritage Club, which specializes in cultural matters. Maggie and her friends would rather have the place torn down for a new rec center, and apparently someone else does, too. A little too much! When the accidents start happening, everyone believes that they're just coincidental. But soon, they become more gruesome and more deadly. Someone would kill to have the place torn down, and they just might get their wish!.....<br />I thought that \\"Blindfold\\" was nothing special. In my opinion, it's very hard to get into, and the suspenseful events were few and far between. It talks about the courthouse for a considerable amount of the story, and doesn't get enticing until the last few chapters. If you're on a mission to read all of Diane Hoh's books, like me, then it would be okay to read it.

Then, the sickening \\"accidents\\" start. Or are they accidents at all?.....<br />I thought this book was great! Richie Tankersley Cusick weaved suspense and romance throughout the book just right. I'll probably end up agreeing with the other reviewers in saying that this wasn't the author's best. This was the first book I read by her, and, standing alone, it seems terrific. But, compared to her other books, it might not seem as good. I'll admit, though, that while the book was suspenseful, it was a little predictable and the killer was, too. Other than that, I loved it!

One night, while she's taking out the trash, he appears out of the darkness, and from there, she falls in love with him. Randy's always been the sensible one, the one to do the right thing. Her father's away for three weeks, and Julian spices up her life. He gets his kicks out of pranks and scaring people. At first, the stunts are harmless, but they get deadlier. Who is Julian? He's always appearing out of nowhere, right on cue, and soon his jokes will ultimately lead to murder!....<br />Sinclair Smith is an awesome author! She definitely has a knack for jokes and pranks (such as in \\"Double Date\\"), but the idea seems to spawn hits. I felt that \\"The Boy Next Door\\" was a very thrilling, suspenseful book. You wondered what Julian was going to think of next, and you didn't know if the main character was starting to go crazy or not. The only flaw was that the ending was a little rushed and a bit hard to follow. Otherwise, it's worth your time!...	2002-10-13

Travis is a very heavy practical-joker, and it shows from the very start of the date with his gruesome pranks. Tracy is uncomfortable at first, and feels that something isn't right. Why does Christie and Travis keep looking at eachother as though they're planning something? Like they hold a special secret? Tracy is forced to believe it's just her imagination by her boyfriend, who finds the pranks funny and harmless. But nothing's funny when Travis takes them all to a deserted mansion and they each start disappearing, one-by-one!<br />\\"Double Date\\" was awesome. It was so interesting that I finished within 3 hours! From the very first page, it has you hooked, which is a great start. From there, the book zooms by, each page holding a different surprise, until you realize that you're finished. The only downfall that I could think of is that towards the end, the killer's attempts were a little weak. Other than that, a must-read!<br />Also recommended: <BR>a.) \\"Amnesia,\\" also by Sinclair Smith<BR>b.) All books by Joan Lowery Nixon	2002-10-13

She has Hodgkin's Disease and becomes friends with a 9-year-old girl named Julie in the hospital. Julie was in a car accident in which her parents were killed. She has no other relatives, and she is terrified of a man she calls Sikes. She insists that he killed her parents and is coming back to finish her off. Will Sikes put Dina's life in jeopardy to get to Julie?...<br />Overall, \\"The Specter\\" was average. I'll admit that there was a stange twist at the end, but the rest of the storyline was bland and boring. There wasn't much mystery until the last couple chapters, and it was a little predictable. Joan Lowery Nixon is my favorite suspense author, but it seems like her earlier books weren't as good as her newer ones (such as \\"The Seance\\" and \\"The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore\\"). Back then, there wasn't as good of sources for ideas, such as scary movies, etc., so I forgive her....<br />Also recommended: \\"Name of the Game Was Murder,\\" \\"Who Are You,\\" \\"Spirit Seeker,\\" and \\"Nobody's There,\\" all by Joan Lowery Nixon!	2002-10-12

How she mixes the perfect amount of humor, love, suspense, and fear all into one book astounds me! \\"Spirit Seeker\\" is among the many, awesome thrillers delivered by Ms. Nixon. Keep 'em coming!<br /> \\"Spirit Seeker\\" is about a girl named Holly Campbell. She has a huge problem! Her best friend -- Cody -- has just been accused of murdering his own parents! Her father is the lead detective on the case, and even he can't deny that all the clues point to Cody. He left his house after a heated argument with his parents, then returned later around the estimated time of death. Holly is positive that Cody wouldn't commit such an evil act, but how can she prove it?<br /> At the scene of the crime, a strange woman named Glenda Jordan stops Holly. She claims that she's a clairvoyant and can see things (that she hasn't physically seen) in her mind. At first, Holly thinks that Glenda is bogus. But then again, why does she call her \\"Amber Girl?\\" After all, lately her amber hairpin has been glowing strangely with heat. Can she really help Holly find the murderer, or is she just wasting her time?<br /> I though this book was good. Nixon has definitely written better. Strictly judging on mystery, I'd actually rate it poor. It had a more clairvoyant, fortune-teller, mystical feel to it (which in the end, turns out to have helped very little). I also think the main character could've dug deeper into the problem, instead of just insisting Cody was innocent. Unlike Nixon's others, there is no stalker, no detecting, and no surprise ending. Plus, Holly's endless, stubborn theory of Cody's innocence gets to be annoying....Overall, I sill think it'd be worth your time!<br />Also recommended: \\"Name of the Game Was Murder,\\" \\"Who Are You,\\" \\"Nobody's There,\\" and \\"Other Side of Dark,\\" all by Joan Lowery Nixon! :)	2002-09-20

She wakes up in a hospital bed, having no idea why she's there! She's quickly informed that she was shot, and had just awakened from a coma four years later! The person who shot her killed her mother, and now Stacy is seventeen (only knowing how to act like a thirteen year old) feeling all alone. But, wait! The murderer would flee the country, right?

I don't know how she does it, but every single book that she writes becomes a hit! She mixes terror and fear with love, devotion, and other common emotions to create stories that not only entertain you, but reach out to you! \\"The Ghosts of Now\\" was no exception. However, I feel that Nixon left the most important part of the story -- the ending -- in the dust; it was just way too abrupt and not suspenseful. Aside from that, Nixon gives away too much information about the characters too early in the story!<br />The story is about a girl named Angie. One night, her brother leaves, but fails to tell Angie where. Since their parents aren't home, Jeremy feels as though he doesn't have to explain himself. After he leaves, Angie gets a call from a person who whispers to her that 'Her brother is dead.' Now -- with Jeremy in a coma, after being the victim of a hit-and run -- Angie sets out on a determined journey to find the coward that attempted to murder her brother. But, it's not as easy as it sounds. People around the town are \\"hush-hush\\" about what they saw they night, and Angie finds that the majority of them are lying! Who? Why?

Jess realizes that she knows nothing about these guys. Plus, they both seem so intent on changing the subject when the topic involves where they came from, what they like, etc. Especially Scott! Those dark eyes, almost scary, seem as though they're always lying; hiding something. Then, things begin to go totally downhill when her neighbor's cat disappears, preceding her own cat's dissappearance! Who's doing this? Jess can't help but suspect Scott, especially after she finds out that he's not who he says he is!

I must say that the ending was very abrupt and wasn't like all Nixon's other endings (action-packed and suspenseful).

Jenny's mother is a mystery writer who is known around the world. Jenny and her mother are invited to their Uncle Arnold's party in San Antonio, celebrating the reading of his will.

I felt that \\"The Weekend Was Murder\\" was better than the first, but was a bit confusing towards the beginning.

She works at the Ridley Hotel as a summer job. One weekend, the hotel hosts a murder-mystery weekend in which a couple hundred people act as sleuths and try to uncover a pre-determined mystery.

Instead, the book drags along, barely keeping you interested, until the last few chapters...<br />The story is about a group of girls who get together one night and have a seance.

She is desperate to go on a trip to France with her class, but her father refuses, being that the trip is to study Roman Catholics and her father is a priest, not believing in the religion.
