I fully expected to get a book that had a history of U.S. artillery from--as the title says--The Spanish/American War to Present.  What I got was an awful book with lousy production values that centered on a hodgepodge of photos about U.S. artilleryman UNIFORMS.  Brother.  The first couple of pages are color, and then the book descends into a morass of black-and-white photos.  Now I know that a lot of (pre-color film) photos were created in B&W, but some are conversions from color to B&W...and very, very poorly done, at that.  They're muddy; haven't been corrected at all, and the screening they did in production is abysmal.  A real disappointment.	2005-01-16

I shopped Amazon.com and bought half-a-dozen \\"how to\\" books for buying a house before I started my search.  I was buying this house on my own, and had no one to rely on for hand-holding or expert advice.  I also had a lot of qualms about the whole process.  Out of all the books I bought, this was the one I kept going back to.  It's typical of a \\"Dummies\\" book in that it doesn't give you too much unusable knowledge, but--coversely--it also doesn't drill down to the nth degree on any one topic.  This is okay, though.  With the usual high-quality editing that goes into most \\"Dummies\\" books, this one is very easy to read.  It talks about who to hire (e.g., real estate agent, mortgage broker, etc.), how to go about hiring them, how to go about getting a mortgage, what are the ins-and-outs of mortgages, how to get a down-payment together, and--I thought--most importantly; how to budget yourself in preparation for homeownership.  This part on figuring out what you spend as a renter and what you think you'll spend as a homeowner helps you decide how much of a house you can afford, and, in my experience, this is one of the big mysteries of buying your first house.  Overall, the book is comforting, reliable [now that I'm in a house, I can see that the advice was good], and well organized.  If you don't know much about how to buy a house, this is a fine start and a trustworthy source of information.	2002-03-23

It's a fine reference source if you want to know what all the different mortgage options are (e.g., what's the difference between a fixed-rate mortgage and an adjustable-rate mortgage, what indexes are ARMs tied to, etc.). And the author--Randy Johnson--makes honest recommendations on which mortgages best suit certain typical lifestyles or income scenarios. Also, one of the books great strengths is the discussion of how many discount points to pay. The one thing I found missing, though*, was at least one real-world scenario that you're likely to see used if you visit a mortgage broker in my neck of the woods [Silicon Valley], or other high-priced regions. And that is the use of a 'first' and a 'second' mortgage in a so-called \\"piggyback financing\\" or \\"80-10-10 financing\\" arrangement which can help you eliminate Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). There's no in-depth discussion of this technique--which is very common--which I found incredible. There's all this advice on getting an ARM tied to the CD index vs. the LIBOR index with a balloon payment if you stay in your house for 3 years instead of 10 years and so on and so forth...but nothing about getting a conforming, fixed-rate, 30-year first mortgage and a smaller second in a technique to reduce your overall payments during the lives of the loans. It's a simple technique, and very worth a detailed analysis, but I couldn't find it. Anyway, like I said, if you want to know esoteric information about mortgages, then this is a worthy book. It helped me, it's just a little shy of a full-fledged 5-star effort.<br />*Please Note:  The review written above pertained to the 1st edition which I initially gave a 4-star rating.  The second edition--which I now own also--has effectively covered \\"Piggyback\\" loans (i.e, 80-10-10 transactions), which I think propels this book into a solid 5-star work.  The second edition also has updated information on shopping for a mortgage on the Internet, and some [though not all] of the examples that show different types of mortgages have had their interest rates brought more into line with present-day (i.e., 2002) rates.  This is an excellent book for folks who want to know all about mortgages.	2002-03-23

It is not only an extremely valuable training aid, but it is also a master work artistically.   Delavier is expert in two areas, and has brought them together in this book: First, he knows physiology.  This book isn't just a superficial treatment of which muscles are involved in an excercise; there are training tips and superb graphic representations of these muscles in action.  Second, Delavier is a master illustrator.  The illustration shown on the cover is indicative of the quality of artwork in the entire volume.  It's profusely illustrated, and the illustrations are all top-notch...every last one of them.  This book is a huge advance for weight-lifters of all types.  Get the book before it's gone.

Chinnery has written at least 4 books on Davis-Monthan AFB (a.k.a. &quot;The Boneyard&quot;). Unfortunately, this is the weakest effort. Don't get me wrong. It's still a solid 4-Stars worth of textual/pictoral entertainment. If you're an aviation enthusiast you'll be enjoying the photos of individual aircraft very much. My gripe with the book is the premise for its existence: That we'd be treated to both aircraft and the emblems that adorn them; maybe splashy nose art, and perhaps treated with a wonderful, historical viewpoint. Alas, I was disappointed. The photos are very good, and you'll see aircraft galore, but to try and create the theme that this is all about aircraft emblems is pushing it. It feels like Chinnery spent a week or two photographing the emblems available at the AFB over those couple weeks, and little else was done photo-research-wise. Even some pre-storage aircraft tail graffiti [though nicely done] made it into this book. You'll see some nose art, but a great deal of what passes as &quot;emblems&quot; are really just &quot;unit badges&quot; and &quot;tail markings&quot;. Nothing to get excited about in either of those arenas either. Get this book for the [exceptional] photography of the aircraft themselves--that's the book's great strength--but pass on it if you want a historical perspective and photo essay on nose art, or if you want a historical perspective on unit badges. It just doesn't make that cut.	2001-08-16

The book also shows us the latest McDonnell-Douglas aircraft after the merger (e.g., F-15, F-18, C-17 and DC-10).  As with other Badrocke illustrations, there are labels/callouts to various parts of the plane which help guide you through its inner workings.  Gunston provides an historical view of many McDonnell-Douglas aircraft which are not illustrated.

The format is larger, and the quality of the photos is excellent.  There's also a tantalizing mix of aircraft...you can hardly wait to turn the page and see what glorious old bird is baking in the hot desert sun on the next page.  You really get a feel for the place, and you see more on these pages than you'd ever get to see in real life; mostly because the tours don't take you everywhere Chinnery was able to go.  You'll see F-105s, F-102s, F-100s, F-4s, A-7s, F-111s, B-52s, even A-10s, C-141s, F-14s, F-15s and F-16s.

If you're an enthusiast, you know that there aren't a lot of books currently available on the C-17; the plane is just too new.  The C-17 is, however, a fascinating plane, and if you're eager for more info you won't be disappointed with this book.  The textual content is first rate.  It has a very pleasing rhythm and balance.  If you have other aerospace books on your shelf you know that sometimes the writer is very technically knowledgeable without possessing adequate writing skills.  Or, the information is unbalanced (e.g., too much history, too little technical, or vice versa).  This book was both written well, and edited well.  The photos, too, are very good.  While most are black-and-white [there are several pages of 4-color photos], they are well printed and not distracting because of their monochromatic nature as in some other, cheaper publications.  I was also impressed with the tidbits of information that Norton delivers.  You'll read about and see information on hidden features (e.g., jacks, APUs, exterior lights, etc.).  All in all, it's a very well delivered presentation on the newest airlifter, and a worthy addition to your aerospace library.	2001-08-13
US	51139031	R37FNUQLFXMN4L	0962991015	617721657	1: Bill Pearls Keys to the Inner Universe : Worlds Best Built Man	Books	5	94	94	N	N	Ahhh...I Love this Book.	What a great bodybuilding book. Bill Pearl created the &quot;bible&quot; of bodybuilding excercises. No one will admit it of course, but it seems nearly all other bodybuilding &quot;how-to&quot; books have borrowed from the master. Here's what he created: Over 640 pages of bodybuilding knowledge; mostly on excercise mechanics, with free-weights predominant (although machines WELL represented). Being a professional illustrator myself (bodybuilding is only my avocation), I can only praise the illustrator, Joan C. Pledger, for her OUTSTANDING line art illustrations of the incredibly numerous excercises. That job must have taken her forever. But it was worth it!  Pearl has broken the book down into body-part sections (e.g., Shoulders, Back, Triceps, etc.) and given us every conceivable excercise possible. There are all the variations (i.e., similar excercise with barbell and then dumbbell). Excercises you never even knew existed. Trust me. If you had, YOU would have written this book. I've heard all the arguments (&quot;Pearl was just bulking up the book with every excercise he could think of...&quot;), but brother, that just misses the point. Here you have the one, the only source you'll ever need if you plan to bodybuild for any length of time at all. It's up to YOU to figure out which excercises to use. Don't have dumbbells? Not to worry...Pearl has a barbell excercise that will do just fine. Tired of the old Triceps Pushdown? No problem. Pick one of the MANY other triceps excercises, and get back to work. Pearl has succinct, cogent textual explanations of all the excercises, and he's even rated them by degree of difficulty. What more could anyone want? How can anyone complain about this masterpiece? I don't know...it's beyond me. I've owned it twice. Once in paperback when I was young (sniff), and now, again, in hardcover because I love it so much. Don't listen to the uninformed nincompoops who only recommend &quot;their&quot; excercises as being the &quot;only&quot; ones that produce results. Liberate yourself; listen to your own body; USE THE BOOK, and get results. If you're a bodybuilder and you haven't at least borrowed this book, you're really missing out.	2001-08-09
US	51139031	R3HOLWHRGBGKGQ	0895298856	610735847	Avery's Sports Nutrition Almanac: Your Complete and Up-to-date Guide to Sports Nutrition and Fitness	Books	5	10	10	N	N	I Was Surprised...This is an Excellent Book.	...It was pretty well buried and anonymous. For these reasons I thought I was probably taking a big chance in buying this book, and that ultimately, I would be disappointed. To the contrary, I have been pleasantly surprised. I still don't get why this isn't a runaway bestseller for athletes, but here's my take on the book. Pros: Extensive information on Carbs, Proteins, Amino Acids, Fats, Water, Vitamins, Minerals, Electolytes, Supplements and even ergogenic Herbs (there is no info on steroids). The strength, I find, in this book is its authoratative tone, and drilling down to reveal esoteric facts. The authoratative tone isn't just evident in the language [the book having been very well edited], but in the knowledge presented. As a strength athlete (bodybuilder) I already know some lesser known facts about nutrition. To have those lesser known facts presented to me in this book makes me trust all the other information in the book that I didn't know. We're not talking about fads or unproven, hyped supplements, but reliable info on which supplements are likely to help, and at what doses. The high-profile supplements are covered (e.g., creatine, ribose, tribulus terrestris, MSM, NADH, HMB, and many, many more), but in a way that is neither pro- nor anti-supplement. You get fair, unbaised opinion on whether the supplement works or not, with case studies cited. There's also an excellent glossary. And there's a very useful website appendix to further your investigations. Lastly, reference sources are cataloged. On the Con side: This is a nit, but there's a section on Who's Who in Sports Nutrition. I disagree with some of the entries, and didn't feel everyone had been covered, but, by nature, this is bound to be subjective; you may find it's just perfect. Also, there's advice sprinkled throughout the book that borders on a recommendation for certain supplements by brand name. I honestly don't think this is because of any tie-ins with the publisher or authors...mostly because they mention numerous and competing brands...but it is a little off-putting at first; at least until you let your guard down and accept it as honest opinion. Anyway, this is a tremendous resource for sports nutrition, and I especially recommend it for my brothers and sisters (there is much on female-specific nutrition) in the iron game. Naturals, in particular, should run...don't walk, to get this book.	2001-08-09

This is the book I found, and it's good.  It's somewhat short (approx. 56 pages), and that took me aback before I cracked it open, but ultimately the book had everything I wanted, so what more was there to print?  What the book has going for it is this:  There are specific routines for &quot;ballistic&quot; performance (i.e., for martial artists, wrestlers, boxers, etc.), athletic performance/strength (i.e., for martial artists, football players, etc.), and for &quot;mass&quot; (i.e., bodybuilders).  There are excellent illustrations showing various excercises for all the different neck and trap muscle types (i.e., neck flexors, lateral benders, extensors, rotators, and trap elevators and adductors), and routines outlined that are well laid out and easy to follow.  I was also impressed with the information on safety, because as you know, your neck is an easily damaged body part, and you don't want to excercise it without fundamental safety knowledge.  Overall, an impressive presentation of very useful information.  Worth it...and no wasted paper.	2001-08-09

It's an okay source of information, but it seems Mindell hasn't met a supplement he won't endorse in some manner or other, even if it is with a caveat or two. I've been &quot;researching&quot; supplements for a long time, too, but I've come away with a different interpretation of whether or not they will work as advertised. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a &quot;bible&quot;. Read the &quot;Physicians' Desk Reference for Nutritional Supplements&quot; if you want to read the real &quot;bible&quot; on supplements. The PDR doesn't trim the facts to suit a lifestyle. Don't get me wrong; Mindell isn't out to mislead, but his medicine cabinet must just be STUFFED with bottles of herbs, vitamins, and other things, and brother, you just don't need all that stuff to live a healthy life. One or half-dozen supplements...okay, but not every supplement under the sun, trying to be slimmer, smarter, sexier, etc. They can't all be good for you, and there are other research claims out there that say some aren't, and may be more harmful than benign. Overall, Mindell's book is for the supplement choir. If you're not a member of the choir yet, reach for the above mentioned PDR before you jump in.	2001-07-13

I have a lot of bodybuilding books. They're pretty much all flawed in one way or another. The best you can hope for is that they're not outrageously incorrect or misleading. I expected no more from this book...and yet, I was pleasantly surprised. It's written by a British team: Eddie Ferrie, a martial artist, and Dennis Oakes, a bodybuilding title holder. Ferrie &amp; Oakes have come up with a solid how-to book on bodybuilding. What's surprising is that they do it without hype, with some humility, and with good structure, editing, and production values. This, as mentioned, is no small thing in the world of bodybuilding books. Specifically, they discuss how to get started bodybuilding, and they keep it real...no lifestyle crud that you and I will never experience. They also discuss specific excercises and diet. The instructional photos were posed by Oakes and--apparently--shot by Ferrie, and they're pretty darn good (another surprise). The book also examines competition, and shows us Oakes competing. It's a refreshing examination without all the media-tie-in hype that surrounds most other discussions of bodybuilding competition. Lastly, Ferrie &amp; Oakes get personal about their experiences with bodybuilding. Sometimes this personal stuff can be over-the-top self-promotion, but these guys come aross as regular Joes. Ferrie talks about his lifelong battle with weight gain, and how bodybuilding helped him. He also discusses the benefits he gained with bodybuilding over some nagging physical pain. Oakes talks in very human terms about his competitions. I especially enjoyed his comments on his meeting the world champion bodybuilder Dorian Yates. It was humble and down-to-earth. It just seemed real to me. Novice and intermediate bodybuilders can gain much insight from one specific point about the book: It shows Oakes in pre-contest and contest condition. It's pretty rare to see that these days. Most bodybuilding books only show bodybuilders cut-up for a show. Those interested should note how Oakes' muscle mass is relatively stable, but that his body fat percentage declines dramatically prior to a contest. It's an eye-opener, and goes to show that bodybuilding is probably half diet. Anyway, a good solid book and highly recommended.	2001-07-08

Yes, it's technical, but if you managed to get through moderately advanced High School science courses, or if you hacked college, don't sweat it, you'll get it. Di Pasquale--an M.D.--gives much in-depth, detailed information on the metabolism, physiological effects of, and potential for excercise enhancement of amino acids, proteins, and their effect on body hormones. Di Pasquale knows that the reader wants to apply the information to athletic performance. He talks about both anaerobic and aerobic excercise, but since he is a former powerlifting champion, he zeroes in on anaerobic excercise (e.g., bodybuilding, powerlifting), which is very refreshing. You also get summary detail toward the end of the book that gives sample supplement doses and critical timing of dosing to maximize results. Di Pasquale also weighs in on other non-amino acid supplements that affect anabolism (or purport to) such as Pyruvate, HMB, etc. (There's no info on steroids, so forget about that.) Overall a terrific advance for bodybuilders and worth it if you want to get away from all the hype and zero in on some science. This book is for the thinking bodybuider. Naturals, in particular, have much to gain.	2001-07-02

They've been carefully chosen by the editor, Pete Sisco.  The articles on training are the best ones that the magazine has to offer.  As with all bodybuilding books, you'll want to pick-and-choose which routines and advice you want to adopt.  I thought the book was a 4-Star book rather than a 5-Star book for the following reasons:  1) The section on Nutrition was weak.  It didn't really address cutting edge nutrition questions, but focused--unusually, I thought--on variations (e.g., vegetarianism), and 2) it's a 2-color book.  This is probably a nit, but the magazine is 4-color, and 4-color photos reproduced as 2-color lose something (especially if they haven't been &quot;color corrected&quot;).  But these aren't really slams on the book as a whole...4-Stars is pretty good.  The one thing I wanted to say above all else, is that Pete Sisco has done the bodybuilding world a huge service by including the anonymous interview with a &quot;Top Pro&quot; bodybuilder and his use of steroids and other drugs.  What an eye-opener.  [Good job, Pete.]  This chapter will let you see why steroids and other drugs are such a disaster for the long-term health of bodybuilding athletes.  I hope younger bodybuilders will read that chapter especially, and make the commitment to train as &quot;naturals&quot;.  It's a really good book, and you'd do well to have it in your bodybuilding library.	2001-06-01

He has a good build, and could generally be considered successful at this. However, I think his book is only a 3-Star. He eschews almost all nutritional supplements as being a waste of money, and advocates positive eating habits. This is okay. But then...believe it or not...there's a near-primer on steroid use. Huh? What? Why? He neither advocates nor condemns their use, but there's all this info. I sure didn't like that part. Bad for kids. I guess on the positive side: The excercise descriptions are helpful; there are some good tips on proper form. As stated earlier, you can get some useful stuff from the nutritional bits, and motivationally he seems on track. Organizationally the book needs a Developmental Editor (as opposed to a Copy Editor), but that's just the way it is with bodybuilding books. He has a section near the end with reminiscences of his amateur days, which is neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned. You may like it. I didn't care. 3-Stars...that's it. There are better bodybuilding books out there (some by Chris Aceto, Bill Pearl, and others). You can safely avoid this book...it seems a little over-hyped if you ask me.	2001-05-23

Additionally, Borushek is a nutrionist and includes meaningful and very useful information on fats, carbs, diabetes, high blood pressure, and more in appendix-like sections of the book. There is also a very up-to-date section on restaurant-specific fast food. I also use the more generic Ethnic Foods section to track down more esoteric-type resaurant foods. A big thumbs up for this one.	2001-05-22

So much of what is published on the topic is hype or unproven. Some bodybuilders may quibble with the fact that Aceto only mentions &quot;known&quot; facts about bodybuilding, but his presentation is better. No hype about building an &quot;awesome physique&quot; or &quot;massive arms&quot; or &quot;ripped this&quot; or &quot;shredded that&quot;...it's more about progressive resistance, good form, solid nutrition, and a very good description of muscle physiology. His key points to bodybuilding may be &quot;known&quot;, but Aceto makes the case that they are the way to stimulate muscle growth...and that's the beauty of the book: It's 'Tips to Muscle Growth' vs. 'Awesome Muscle-Blasting Routines of the Pros'. You choose. There are two &quot;cons&quot; about the book that brought it from a 5-Star rating to a 4-Star rating in my estimation: 1) Aceto--as in some of his other books--needs a copy editor. There are some typos and grammatical inconsistencies. Not enough to throw you, but they're there. 2) The book does suffer from a superficiality, of sorts. He states a fact or opinion, gives a reason or two, then moves on. There is no real in-depth, drilling-down except in certain Aceto-mastered areas (e.g., muscle physiology, nutrition, etc.). However, this is not a real show-stopper...the information contained is reliable, and the book is a very good adjunct to other books you may have on the subject.	2001-05-21

It shows in his writing. You'll never find a bodybuilding book that is &quot;art&quot;, but as a reference source this book is pretty good. I do have a few &quot;cons&quot; about this book, though: It's somewhat abivalent about the steroid issue. Some of the information in this book (though not the majority) seems to be geared toward the steroid-using bodybuilder without acknowledging it, which may be confusing to &quot;naturals&quot;. There is almost a wink-and-a-nod about steroid use in a few of the glossary entries. However, this is not uncommon in bodybuilding books, so you'll have to judge for yourself if the information in these few entries is right for you. The other gripe I have is that this book is in need of a professional copy editor. There are numerous typos and grammatical inconsistencies. Overall, you may think I'm slamming this book, but I'm not. Dive into it with your eyes open and you can come away with some good stuff, especially about non- or low-controversial supplements like vitamins, minerals, etc.	2001-05-16

I tried this book, because it seemed like what I wanted; information on how to get started cooking. I have no basic cooking skills, so traditional cookbooks leave me dusted before I get past the introduction. Also, what I now have learned is a hallmark of Betty Crocker cookbooks, you will notice that the production values are very high (lots of color, lots of illustrative content). Content-wise, nothing is assumed. My advice: If you want to learn how to cook, get this book.	2001-05-16
US	51139031	RENHU2A31A20Q	0028631978	249127553	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Weight Training	Books	5	52	54	N	N	Good Book for Beginners	When I first read this book, I thought it was too broad in scope. A re-read has changed my mind. Here's what I think threw me the first time through: This book is written by athletes who have other sports as their prime activity. One is a cyclist, the other is a kayaker, and the third is a power-lifter/physical therapist. They're not bodybuilders, per se. They &quot;weight train&quot; to build strength for their other activities. They acknowledge the aesthetics and general fitness that weight training brings, but they keep coming back to their roots. The reason I'm making a 180 on a recommendation for this book is because the advice is sound. All of it. That is SO hard to find in bodybuilding/weight lifting books. If you haven't discovered it yet, you'll find that bodybuilding is full of hype. This book is not like that. Your motivation is your own, so use this book as a tool to attain either increased strength, better overall fitness, bodybuilding, or whatever. It's valuable as an adjunct to whatever else you're doing.	2001-05-16

It's very small, very broad, and about as informative as asking a co-worker about their experiences buying a cell phone. This book had about the same &quot;take away&quot; as a compilation of Lifestyle articles from your Sunday newspaper combined with the glossy promo pieces that cell phone dealers give away. This book is barely more satisfying than eating a bag of microwave popcorn for dinner. You'll not learn much about CDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc.  In my opinion, you don't need to buy a book that tells you to be careful when you sign a cell phone contract, or that contract terms can vary, or that calling plans can come with lots of minutes or not so many minutes, or that you may run into something called &quot;roaming&quot;. Yeesh. I know that some people need this information (I did, too, at one time), but a much better source would be a book that gave you those one or two paragraph tidbits PLUS some real meat on the bone (i.e., other information about the technology). In my opinion, a better book (which I now own) is &quot;The Cell Phone Handbook : Everything You Wanted to Know About Wireless Telephony (But Didn't Know Who or What to Ask)&quot; by Penelope Stetz. (And, no, there are no conflicts of interest in my recommending Stetz's book over Lenart's.)	2001-05-16

The instructional photos are also excellent. The one thing that keeps me from giving it a 5-Star review is that McRobert states--more or less--that if an excercise is not included in the book then it isn't safe. I find this to be an overly wide-reaching concept. There are lots of safe weight-training excercises not covered...especially if you're a beginning or intermediate bodybuilder. McRobert spends considerable time indicating how he has sustained some chronic injuries from weightlifting. He also indicates that he has a physiological condition or two that makes weightlifting a little more risky than for the average bear. I suspect that these injuries, and his own unique physiology have colored his assessment of what is a \\"safe\\" excercise; and justly so. However, I wouldn't avoid an excercise that isn't included in this book. Staying injury-free is the bodybuilder's own responsibility. Listen to your body. If it's complaining, try and figure out what you're doing wrong and adjust it. If you're more of an advanced bodybuilder, the information in this book is more suited to keeping you healthy, since you're more likely to be throwing around huge poundages. Overall, an excellent book and [conditionally] highly recommended.	2001-05-16
US	51139031	R1DGGTLMBFFOXZ	0679450815	736500699	The Fannie Farmer Cookbook: Anniversary	Books	4	12	15	N	N	Needs Better Production Values	I'm only giving it a 4-Star rating. Don't get me wrong, the textual content is very good. Other reviewers have so stated. My gripe is with the production values. It's a two-color book. No photos, only so-so technical illustrations, and these aren't even distributed throughout the book effectively. They're all bunched up toward the front-end of the book in a nearly tabular format. The paper stock is on the cheapy side, too. This is all a sure sign of a publisher cutting corners to maximize profits. If other cookbook publishers can go glossy 4-color with photos and a spiral binding, I don't see why these folks can't. So, make up your own mind...good text (buy this book) or good overall (try a Betty Crocker or Better Homes &amp; Gardens book).	2001-05-16

I'm a natural bodybuilder, and Steve Reeves is an example of just how far a &quot;natural&quot; can go. His heyday was before steroids ruined bodybuilding, so you can at least see what the human potential is for someone who eschews the illegal and unethical use of steroids. The book has some personal bio stuff, motivational Q&amp;A, nutritional stuff, workout stuff...the whole shebang. I use it mostly as motivation. There's no winking-and-nodding about steroid use (most cut, super bulked pros are on the &quot;juice&quot;), because Steve happened BEFORE anyone knew about steroids, much less how to use them to any effect. Like the title to this review says, get it while you can. Classics don't necessarily last forever.	2001-05-16

I haven't read most of Lapp's book because I'm an omnivore, and I continue to eat meat [although no veal, little pork and beef]. However, one of her book's appendices is excellent for gaining insight into how to combine vegetable protein sources to get a &quot;complete protein&quot; profile that mimics animal protein sources. Worth it for this information alone.	2001-05-15
