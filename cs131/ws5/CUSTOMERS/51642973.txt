At this late date, it would be somehow silly to elaborate on the qualities that have made *The Sea, The Sea* Iris Murdoch's masterpiece, and that have secured its place over the past quarter-century as one of the greatest postwar English novels, if not more.  It would be equally pointless to assess the oft-analyzed literary and cultural allusions, the ingenious plotting and shimmering characterization which make it so.  The novel is and will remain a marvel.<br />However, while I am not a fan of introductions on principle, the Penguin edition's introduction, by Mary Kinzie, stands for me as the most sapient *and* succinct commentary on the novel ever written, so I give 5 stars to it, as well.  <br />This is not to suggest that one should read this or any introduction in place of the novel itself, or even before it (unless you're already familiar with it).  But Ms. Kinzie is one of the few writers who does Murdoch justice, and her essay serves to augment a text whose richness is in a class all its own.	2003-07-07

I'm sorry--I'm sure it's uplifting, for some, cathartic--but out of respect for one of my favorite novelists, who was a very PRIVATE person, I wish Bayley would keep his precious journaling to himself.  Perhaps I, too, have kept diaries during and after the deaths of dear family members.  Some of them quite well-known in their &quot;fields.&quot;  I have kept these to myself.<br />There seems to be a great need in Bayley to see himself as a special sort of caregiver, and to relegate Iris Murdoch to a sort of eccentric baby.  You like reading this, you respect him for publishing it and getting money for it, you find it touching?  Well, find five stars in place of my one.<br />I'm just, frankly, revolted, and horrified at all this.  Perhaps I'm the only one!  Though I got the book as well, just like the others, always looking for substance--of this I suppose there are different kinds.  Has Mr. Bayley ever written a novel, I wonder?  Or 26 of them?

Now in print 30 years, this novel, to my mind one of the finest of the 20th century in English, certainly deserves the honor. It is a multi-layered page-turner, both exciting and dramatically profound.<br />What it doesn't deserve, however, is Martha C. Nussbaum's quite misleading introduction-and this is the reason I cannot teach the book in my college classes, as an introduction by a scholar is tacitly seen as somehow \\"correct\\" in its claims and observations, almost an appendage to the text it introduces, especially to students.  Nor is there a forum for readers to write letters of rebuttal to an introduction, outside of what I am doing now.<br />But while Nussbaum's background is in philosophy, as was Murdoch's, this is a novel, a work of imaginative literature.  Nussbaum treats the text as an expression of Murdoch's own philosophical beliefs.  This is problematic in theory, and can be almost ridiculous in practice, as it becomes here-I wonder why Nussbaum (not a literary critic or novelist herself) was chosen to write the introduction in the first place?<br />Iris Murdoch's novels are \\"philosophical\\", but not in the way Ms. Nussbaum would have it-in short, she makes the cardinal error of attributing to Murdoch's characters the author's own philosophical convictions.  The protagonist, Bradley Pearson, is in many ways a quite disturbed man, whose critisism of the work of Arnold Baffin is parodic of the negative reviews Murdoch herself received during the 60s (for her work as a prolific, popular novelist).  But Pearson's litanies on platonic love in Part Two are not \\"philosophy\\"--they are the histrionic ramblings of a failed writer having a psychological breakdown.  <br />I could go on, but my point is that Ms. Nussbaum's observations are akin to someone writing about Shakespeare's Philosophy of Art, Love and Humanity using quotes from Iago or Richard III as if they were the playwright's \\"own\\" carefully measured words. <br />While disquieting that such an esteemed publisher would have allowed this, and that someone as astute in philosophy as Ms. Nussbaum would write it, the book itself remains what it is: a true 5-star classic.	2003-06-25

Its social satire is subtly scathing, and its brilliance understated--it begins as a sort of *parody* of a bad detective novel, and quickly goes into deep waters without the tedious ponderings of the longer works of a Pynchon, whose glowing praise of it graces the cover. Nor does it offer the vacuous koan-like soundbytes of the author's contemporaries, such as Palahnuik. <br />Instead, it does something different--it becomes profound and thought-provoking BECAUSE it's hilarious and fun, with a bevy of characters we all recognize from life. I enjoyed every page. There is substance here, too--the book operates on more than one level, with life imitating art--and vice-versa.<br />What a pleasure it is to read something unpretentious that is enjoyable and thought-provoking at the same time!	2003-06-12

And don't be daunted by its length--it's actually a real page-turner, in the GOOD sense, though it begs for multiple re-reads.  I'm familiar with the negative criticism of the book--that it's full of \\"sound bytes\\", it's a non-linear story, whatever...and sure, you bet!  Though I wonder how many people who affect to dislike it have actually really *read* it--and don't worry, it's not (just) about the Cold War, New York, drugs, or baseball. It is a monumental masterpiece, a book that will be a classic for many, many years, and it will take that long for we as readers to fully come to terms with its genius, if indeed we ever fully do.  All that, and it's STILL a...FUN READ! It really is. How DeLillo pulled all this off, I'll bet even HE doesn't know.<br />I wouldn't recommend *Underworld* as a reader's first Don DeLillo book--that would be *White Noise*, probably, which still holds up as a cultural mirror when I teach it in college freshman and sophomore classes, though it's now 18 years old--but then again, so does *Americana*, DeLillo's first novel, published in 1971!<br />But I consider it to be one of the finest American novels written in my lifetime, one of those books you've just gotta read before you die.  Actually, death and the threat and fear of it (even, or *especially*, in \\"life\\") is DeLillo's Great Theme--in ALL his 13 books--and MY life, for one, has been enriched by having read them all, and in particular this one.	2003-06-10

I have seldom if ever revised my opinion of an author based on a posthumous work-until now.  I confess to having found the late William Gaddis' other (and in some circles, classic) novels (J.R., Frolic of His Own, The Recognitions, and Carpenter's Gothic) theoretically interesting and probably brilliant, but always far too long, very self-indulgent, difficult for its own sake and almost unreadable-in other words, they bored me, what I could get through of them. <BR>This prejudice of mine is coupled with a general dislike for posthumous works in general-the kind where a Major Author left a work unfinished at death, and which is years after released and edited with an introduction or forward by some noted Scholar: (\\"This really IS a great book, all of Fitzgerald's/Hemingway's/Duras'/McGowin's major Themes are here,\\" etc., etc.).  Well, they very seldom are great works, and just as the act of Revision seems contrived to some (your Kerouac wannabes, perhaps), I, conversely, find the act of posthumous publication to itself be contrived-again, in general.  Glenn Gould, the great pianist, once expressed his intense dislike of \\"live\\" recordings being released on record labels with the surrounding hoopla, and said he planned to do a \\"fake\\" live album, recorded in the studio, complete with mistakes and overdubbed with audience coughing, etc.  Sony of course wouldn't go for it, but I've often wanted to write a \\"fake\\" posthumous novel, the Final (unfinished) Work of a Great American Novelist-I'll make it about 100 de-contextualized pages, with 200 pages of forwards, introductions, afterwards, and footnotes.  Now that Dave Eggars is a Publisher, he should get in touch.<BR>But in the case of Agape Agape, the Afterward is totally superfluous.  The book was finished when Gaddis died, and I don't need to have that explained to me, nor do I care what Joseph Tabbi et. al. Think of it in the overall context of Gaddis' other novels or what it started out as or what Gaddis wanted it to achieve.  It's 125 pages, and all of a piece, without section or chapter breaks, the perfect length for what is the most cohesive and affecting book the man ever wrote-the free-associations of a dying narrator who's afraid his lifelong goal to write the definitive history of the player piano will never come to fruition.  Into this frenetic and breathless narrative, then, is woven...everything.  What begins with the narrator's opinions concerning several aspects of the History and Future of Technology becomes a fictional autobiography the likes of which has rarely been achieved, cemented by the character's grasp of mortality and humanity, and by Gaddis' seamless and masterful narrative drive.  He is ON.  <BR>This is a one or two-sitting book, and the reader will come away from it reeling.  It's too brief for me to go into specifics, for the specifics are the book, the book is the plot-but if you've never read Gaddis, START HERE.  And if you need to picture a Literary Precedent, think of Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground, perhaps, or of the best shorter work by Camus or John Hawkes-but only think.  Because this book suceeds where Gaddis' other novels drag in that it also makes you feel.	2003-06-03

Ireland, early 20th-century: in the midst of a volatile political climate, a family is forced to move in a hurry.  They go to France, believing their young daughter dead-but she's not.  Lost while visiting her favorite local places for what she believes to be the last time, among the crags and cliffs by the sea, an item of clothing caught in a branch seems proof to the horrified family and friends that she is gone, drowned.<br />William Trevor's riveting and suspenceful novel is the work of an experienced and masterful storyteller.  More conventional in plot and form than most books I review, I can tell you no more than the information in that first paragraph unless I want to do a book report, not a book review.  The review is that this novel is captivating, horrifying, tender, and astoundingly beautiful.  Trevor writes not a word too few or a word too many, and his plotting and narrative timing are close to perfect.  <br />Genius, it's probably not.  But I'm getting incresingly tired of writers who shoot the moon every single time.  I've read Trevor's stories, and there as here find him to be a supurb craftsman in an established British prose tradition-but what makes him stand out is his empathy--the capacity to genuinely affect the reader-and the lyrical atmosphere, his uncanny ability to create a lush literary landscape peopled with those crippled with gut-wrenching anxieties and pain.  The result is a stylistic and narrative resonance of taut and tempestuous power.<br />  If you want something fast-paced and saucy, you won't find it here.  But if you can enjoy a novel by, say, Graham Greene, or appreciate the unique talent involved in writing such a book....then the present volume is better even than that.  Or at least it won't let you down.  For when it comes to telling a story, lots of people can do it.  But for me, when the story is told well, in a traditional way, and yet the feeling it leaves me with is best described as \\"eerie\\" or \\"disquieting\\"--then maybeit wasn't so traditional after all.	2003-06-03

James Cook & Crew's three voyages in the Pacific northwest and beyond,  is simply the most interesting and engaging work of nonfiction (or \\"creative nonfiction\\") I have read in the past five years.  The one before it was Horwitz's last book, Confederates in the Attic-and while that was riveting for me on a personal level, as I grew up in the South, Blue Latitudes is the better book, more universal and accessable, a mixture of first-person journalism with strong narrative technique (creative nonfiction) and history, which is presented so smoothly as to make you amazed you read this thing in a weekend and couldn't put it down, and then you get to the end and notice from the Selected Bibliography that this is also a major work of scholorship-the kind that makes Academics jealous because it's better than they are without being boring and stuffy.  I'll bet it makes popular travel writers/participatory journalists like Paul Theroux or Geroge Plimpton envious because Horwitz can do research and they can't-and as in his earlier book he comes across as a likeable guy, not a self-important megalomaniac. <br /> This is the kind of book that, for me at least, comes along once about every 3-5 years-if you're like me, and read widely and often, chances are you have some friends and family who do also, and you want them all to read it, you want to be the one to give it to them, holiday or no, which is what I did with Confederates in the Attic and  is also what I'm doing with Blue Latitudes.   Tony Horwitz already has a Pulitzer Prize in Journalism, for his early '90s work as a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal on the first Gulf War; he deserves another for this, in history.  <br />And as I'm obviously giving this book the big Two Thumbs up and Then Some, and spending 1000 words doing it, let's just go on with this little line of thought for a moment, shall we?  We shall.  We were reading it at 4 am, wishing it were closer to Father's Day-and not just our father, either!  One can teach it to high school students.  Beautiful women  can read it while laying out sipping Daquiris on the beach this summer.  Grad students can use it in their dissertations, and even idiots can enjoy it.  We were flipping through our phone book and didn't find a person therein who wouldn't dig it all the way to Tahiti and back in a pea-green boat, even those who care little or nothing for books on travel or history.<br />And I admit that before I picked it up, Captain Cook and his voyages had never been that important to me, or seen by me as having literally shaped the modern world as we know it-nor was I aware that Star Trek has been ripping off details from Cook for years.  I was at one time very interested in the Franklin Expedition, and in the past few years the culture's had Shackleton Fever, but it took the writing of Tony Horwitz to really get me Cooking-and it's amazing how fascinating it all is, no matter who you are or what you normally like to read.  It's as good as Six Feet Under on one of those nights where the episode lasts the full hour.<br />James Cook truly did chart new territories, going where no European had gone before-and he did it in his 50s, which was of course elderly in the late 1700s, in conditions that make a jail cell look like San Francisco Bay without the fog.  Yep, Horwitz has a real prediliction for examining Hardcore Human Experience-and while he does so with the upmost taste and delicacy (which often gives the writing a certain ironic hilarity), you'd be hard-pressed (pun intended) to find an S & M site on the Internet where they get into stuff like the voyages of Cook's Endeavour.  And it's all right here in this book-and sex, you wanted that, too, right?  Well, read the chapter about when they go to Tahiti.  They had more fun than Marlon Brando in the 70s.  And gave the \\"new\\" world all the \\"old\\" had to offer-to the point at which the population of said island was reduced by some 95% in the next hundred years.  Indeed, on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution, Cook's voyages define for Horwitz the literal beginnings of global Eurocentric hegemony and homogony-but the sex sure seemed like a good idea at the time.<br />That's what Sir Joseph Banks, the youthful naturalist, thought, at least-he loved it, and you gentlemen will read the book and fancy yourself Sir Joseph in Tahiti circa 1770.  You ladies out there, you want him, too!  You won't want Cook, but you'll really get into the toughness of it-well, I take it back-a woman like Melanie Hassler would desire Cook, a man who makes Shackleton and Franklin and Bering and Amundsen put together look like an uncooked hot dog.  There's violence in this adventure story, too-I mean really.  It's got you hanging on every word-because just about every word is true, it's wild, all the popular genres rolled into one, with NASA parallels thrown in to boot!  You'll want to buy it for your Hairdresser.  Your Dentist.  Your Boss.  And if these are all the same person (could be), you'll start in on your kids.  <br />Because while I could step back and really analyze how brilliant is Horwitz's own account of shadowing (in his own ways) Cook's journeys, and noting changes, etc. (and making a lot of sapient observations between the lines as suggestions, too), I think the most remarkable thing about this book is how accessable and engaging and, yes, fun it can be to read a book on history-when it's written like this, for this, as I've shown, is about a little of everything.  And you'll be surprised, as I was, at how much you'll learn-major facts, geography, dates, names, events, as well as tidbits that bring to life, by microcosm, the very different worlds of the past in a past where there were, for the very last time-different worlds.<br />1000 words, folks, and what I've said ain't the half of it.  But go buy it or check it out and go read it-you'll wish every history book read like a book by Tony Horwitz.<br />Or, who knows, maybe you won't.  But I feel sure that you believe that I do.	2003-06-03

Pagels sees the primacy of the \\"orthodox\\" in essentially political terms, centering the second-century Gallic bishop Irenaeus (fl. 190) as its most  influentual figure.  The drawback with the collected essays-as-book method is that the subtitle is somewhat deceptive and she repeats herself, as it were, some seventeen times, often word-for-word: too frequently for a two-sitting read that is presented as a new book.  In her transitions, added for book publication, the seams show.<BR>Still, the volume is a brilliant and engaging addition to the work that has made Pagels one of, if not the most important and accessable religious historian of her generation; and if you just read one book on religion published this year, for the sake of God, let it be this one.	2003-06-03

He's never been better.  The humor of *Americana*, the poignant profundity of *White Noise*, the treatment of relationships in *Mao II*, the grit of *Underworld*, the soaring lyricism of *The Body Artist*...the BEST of them are all present here, in just over 200 pages.<br />There was a time when I thought DeLillo had a &quot;niche&quot; and that the Zeitgeist had necessarily passed him by--ah, but he's WAY too good.  I don't consider him an &quot;Apocolyptic Postmodernist&quot; anymore, if indeed he ever FIT that label which reviewers too commonly affix to his books--if one MUST put it in a phrase, he's a satirical Spiritual Humanist, concerned with personal identity in a frenetic world, with isolation and with loneliness, and with the absurdity of the world that serves as its own complex character in his work.<br />This is, at first reading, a difficult book--and it's worth it.  Authors like, say, Chuck Palahnuik are doing what DeLillo *used* to do--but DeLillo is truly amazing in his ability to adapt to the &quot;times&quot; and continually out-write the younger writers who are so heavily influenced by him.  <br />It occurs to me that if there's a book to compare this to, it's not DeLillo himself but, in sundry strange yet fitting ways, *Notes from the Underground*, by Dostoyevsky.  I've read the other reviews here, and I understand, I believe, both the positives and the negatives of what these readers are saying.  It took even *me* a second reading to really begin to &quot;get&quot; it--*Cosmopolis* is condensed, very complex, disquieting and challenging.<br />I'm glad I took the challenge.  In the midst of the times in which we live, we're often left reeling--and this book just made me feel so vital, so validated to live in my own skin.  <br />So...*alive*.	2003-05-23

But in this book, about the author's recent hardcore drug addiction, Elizabeth Wurtzel comes across as self-absorbed as any active junkie.  Plus, the writing's poor--and the value judgments are distasteful.<br />Ms. Wurtzel congratulates herself with a sense of histrionic gravity that approaches a Sarah Bernhardt death scene for being clean 4 years (or so) now.  Of course, it's all about *her*.  And *she* is boring.  Plus, the \\"I've beat it\\" sentiment does no one any good--I've heard that 4 years, for a hard drug addict, is not very much.  And she's *selling* this, for profit!<br />Hey, I'm sure Elizabeth Wurtzel *is* clean--or I would hope so.  I hope this book helps someone struggling with the demons she relates.  But is she sane, happy, \\"sober\\"?  <br />Here's my advice--deal with the issues where they should be dealt with, and move on, like, say, Denis Johnson.  And one hopes Ms. Wurtzel's now clear imagination can create another book--this time, about someone other than herself.	2003-02-20

This is quite possibly Theroux's most ambitious project in straight *fiction*, and it's extremely well-written and well-crafted.  The &quot;voice&quot; of the elderly female narrator is at times just a bit unconvincing, but as a novelist, Theroux isn't at all what one might think from his numerous &quot;travel&quot; books--this is riveting and almost shocking, and quite vivid.  <br />Finally, Theroux is one of those few novelists (Iris Murdoch and Robertson Davies come to mind) who seamlessly weaves a large amount of knowledge, history and culture into his narratives.  In its way, this is also one of the finest books on photography ever written.  I encourage you to find a copy--there's something here for those who like literary fiction, vivid description and...an excellent story.	2003-02-14

It demonstrates a young man's coming-of-age stuggles more astutely than any book I've read, and while it's easier to read than the later book, it's just as poignant: we often rather smugly hide behind our baggage and consider younger people frivolous because of inexperience, or somehow incapable of love.  Theroux shows that they *do* feel love, of romance, friendship, respect--and these emotions form the measuring sticks by which all our subsequent experiences will be measured.  Moreover, the book itself is an act of love--of writing and of living.  It has made me value my own life more fully, through pages that made me relate, reflect, laugh, and read until dawn, and then, the better for it, get up and start writing, myself.  <br />And living. <br />Just read the tender, blunt and beautiful first section, and I seriously doubt you'll stop.	2003-02-06

Stephen King has this kind of novel down to a formula, one he can repeat over and over for the rest of his life, if he chooses.  The present incarnation of this book, while more mature than say, CHRISTINE (1983), has its moments, sloppy and predictable though some of them are.  <br />King has said as much himself in a recent article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY.  I found FROM A BUICK 8 a little boring, and a little tired, but nevertheless I rather liked it, as here, as with many of King's recent works, the &quot;horror&quot; serves as a background and the REAL theme relates to timeless human concerns.<br />But he's done that before, too, and better.  Worse, too, hence my 3 out of 5.  And if he means it, in saying that this book is a good place to end the publishing spree on, I'm not gonna argue.  Because maybe it is.	2002-10-18

The present volume explores Bakers talents and contributions to music and the culture that embraced it even less than most bios on Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain, and instead focuses on the well-known fact that Baker was a lifelong drug addict.  It also takes pains to show what a nasty person the man was in general.  Ok--I'm sure he was, just like lots of musicians and artists and bankers and lawyers.  But when it comes to the work, one wonders if Gavin ever really *listened* to it or cared for it--or if he simply saw an opportunity to cash in on the Morbid American Fascination with the Self-Destruction of Talented People.  <br />But if that's what you WANT, and you well might, you'll find it here and then some--but it (both subject matter and book) is boring, tedious, dull and depressing.

It's the only other book by Kennedy I've read, but I liked it well enough to want to pick up the new one, and for the most part am glad I did.<BR> <BR>Ironweed is one of those rare novels that translated well to the Big Screen--I thought the adaptation, with Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep and Tom Waits was terrific.  Much of the reason why is perhaps that Kennedy is among the most &quot;cinematic&quot; of &quot;literary&quot; novelists, a quality in evidence with the present book, too--in a way that somehow reminds me of D.H. Lawrence, Kennedy is capable of vivid lyrical flights which never detract from an otherwise conventional narrative, and which evoke an overtly visual panoramic landscape.  As in Ironweed, Kennedy weaves the surreal in with the realism of the prose, creating a convincing and often brilliant effect where the reader is able to step into the actual conciousness of a character--&quot;hearing&quot; dead people &quot;speak&quot;, for example--without missing a beat of the forward motion of the plot.<BR> <BR>But that is where the novel becomes a little weighty.  Much of the motion of the book is slow and cumbersome, and at times a bit predictable, as we enter the lives of a post-WW II Albany small-time polititian and his world of other politicians, complete with the lack of character one might expect from such characters.<BR> <BR>Not that we're supposed to especially like Roscoe, the man, but one never really gets a very clear sense of him or of any of the many other characters in this novel.  It's easy to say that this is because Kennedy is suggesting that there's not much to them, but I don't buy the imitative fallacy.  We're introduced, mid-stream, to such a plethora of people and their lineages in a mere 291 pages that all the characters, even the principals, are drawn far too thinlyto sustain a narrative about events that are less disagreeable than rather tedious and boring.  Perhaps I'm missing something because I haven't read all seven books of the cycle, but a novel should stand on its own.<BR> <BR>Vivid, lyrical writers like Kennedy, and at times Lawrence, seem to often fall into this predicament.  Kennedy is at times wryly funny in a way Lawrence never was, but he seems to want to create a microcosm of America a bit...obviously, a bit too much.<BR> <BR>But the actual writing, save for some episodes of forgettable dialogue, soars.  At his best, Kennedy is spectacular, a surreal prose-poem stylist who's worth reading simply for the tightness of the imagery and the energy that bursts out of his sentences like atoms splitting in the middle of a consonant.  There is no American fiction writer alive who can come close to William Kennedy in this aspect of his prose.<BR> <BR>Which is why Roscoe is finally a success.  The prose itself creates a narrative of its own, and makes me wonder if conventional standards of character and narrative should even be held to apply to such a vigorous, fresh way of telling a story.	2002-01-10

The blatant ironies are more subtle here, and yet a work on a small canvas is no less riveting: DeLillo is simply no writing what people are used to from him, such as the lists in WHITE NOISE or the allusions to and indictments of popular American culture in his other works.<br />Now over 60, DeLillo has the insight to see that the Culture has now caught up, in Real Time, with his parodic treatment of middle-class suburban America.  This feeling is also present in UNDERWORLD, which is set at mid-20th century, but it's far too easy to see a short novel as a reaction to the tendency toward BLEAK HOUSE-length tomes of five years ago.  It is another voice entirely, one DeLillo has always flirted with in sections of all his novels, but never allowed to become the dominant Voice.<br />THE BODY ARTIST is every bit as surreal as &quot;vintage&quot; DeLillo and, if you wish, as apocalyptic.  Yet it is rather pointless to compare the work with WHITE NOISE or MAO II or even UNDERWORLD.  It is the story of the most profound apocalypse: the internal, personal one.  DeLillo shares a certain vector or vision with Carver, Cheever, and even Kafka in this sense, yet the work is still distinctly his own.<br />THE BODY ARTIST has been criticized for DeLillo's &quot;sentimentality.&quot;  Let's make an important distinction--the characters feel things deeply, edging toward insanity in their own isolation.  DeLillo, however, pulls off an astounding flight of horrible, lyrical beauty in this book, a downright HAUNTING fluidity of descriptive prose that is so masterful it makes WHITE NOISE look like the abrasive sarcasm of an insufferable child.  <br />Don DeLillo is, quite honestly, a much better writer than I ever really thought he was.  He was clever and witty, sometimes profound--but rarely empathetic.  And with THE BODY ARTIST, he enters another aspect of humanity, a place where what we fear the most doesn't come from without but from within: not the fear of death, but the reality of it.  He goes for not the brain but the soul.  And he arrives.  No, I doubt you'll be entertained--you'll be emotionally pummeled by this book's implications. <br />And so long as someone can face head-on what DeLillo does here and WRITE it, well, my regret is not that THE BODY ARTIST is not WHITE NOISE.  My regret is that I am not as good as Don DeLillo.	2001-03-06

He doesn't write with the dry smugness of an academic and yet doesn't insult the intelligence of all others looking for the essence of the facts behind the myths, which are often more grisly than the myths themselves.  This last fact, elucidated clearly by Barber, makes his treatment of Vampires a folkloric anomaly more captivating than most of us would heretofore have imagined.	2000-10-22

On the rare occasions on which I'm inspired to write a &quot;review&quot; for Amazon, I like to make it short and sweet:  and my title perhaps says it best.  I've enjoyed David Bottoms' work for some time, but THIS (with  its wonderful Lonnie Holley cover, to boot) is the kind of book that  reminds me why I still read contemporary American poetry.  It resonated  with me, and in fact once I started I kept reading all night--and it's  graceful, a source of inspiration.  I give it the highest compliment I know  how to give a fellow poet--there are poems in this collection in which a  phrase is turned and a closure leaves you with chills, or better yet when a  complex emotion is captured with a seamless and direct simplicity that  makes me want to call up a good friend at 2:00 in the morning and say,  &quot;Hey, wake up, you're gotta listen to THIS!&quot;<br />So what are its  themes, what's it about?  Living, aging, perhaps considering mortality and  then living more abundantly, complexities conveyed in the epiphany of a  &quot;vagrant grace.&quot;  The riveting honesty of a mature poet at the  very top of his game.<br />KM	2000-01-23

Stephen King's latest novel begins as a half-hearted stab at being  literate psychological realism, a page-turner in the distinctive King voice  that &quot;samples&quot; REBECCA, Thomas Hardy and Somerset Maugham.  After  a slow start it becomes an engaging and sometimes riveting of a writer's  deteriorating psyche, and then the novel itself deteriorates seriously in  the last 150 pages as King seems to just give up on his story and revert  back to narrative tricks and supernatural explainations familiar from his  lesser novels.  Given the premises he has set up, the final third of the  novel becomes at times completely unbelievable: and this is a serious  problem, as King's greatest work has the central strength of a seamless  transition between the mundane and ordinary and the fantastic.  Here the  seams show: you can see the one-line revisions thrown in the edit to  explain or cover up a loose end or a contradiction (although he and his  editor by no means get them all) and one even gets the sense that the  novel's ending was written at a different time altogether, so abrupt is the  shift.<br />For an uneven novel that isn't sure what it wants to be or what  its characters' motivations are, it does have its moments and its share of  beautifully-written passages, interesting connections, and caustic humor. I  doubt it will attract any new readers, but many steadfast King fans will  like it, recognizing it as superior to much of his late 80's work, although  they will recognize it to be drawn-out but its own confusion and about 100  pages too long--a slip of concentration from the author of &quot;The  Stand&quot; and &quot;It&quot;, both extra-long novels that worked.  And  whatever the NEW YORKER would have you believe, it's not a great work of  literature: it's not &quot;The Shining&quot;, nor is it even consistent  with the best of King at his non-horror best (&quot;The Dead Zone&quot;,  &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;.<br />The veryend of the novel, its &quot;epilogue&quot;, is the most self-conscious and  self-referential slice of meta-fiction King has ever penned (and that's  saying something).  In the voice of the writer/narrator, the author more or  less confesses to being dissatisfied with his work and its formulaic  tricks, and suggests that he's about had it for now.  This leaves Stephen  King, the author, an out should he decide to keep at it--but it's  essentially a tired announcement of retirement from someone who's been  flirting with it for a while now.  This isn't a &quot;comeback&quot; novel  or a &quot;career&quot; novel--it's a farewell one, and that's perhaps as  it should be.  Reading the novel over in this light gives both it and its  author a kind of dignity the book on its own doesn't have, and that's by no  means a bad way to go.	1998-10-11
