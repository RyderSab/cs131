As a Historical Fiction, it was very well researched and except where noted, kept pace with the period. Ms. Cary has done a delightful job of filling in the blanks. This is a truly gripping book. I found myself caring about what happened next. The characters were well defined and I found it very easy to relate to them. Overall this is a very well written story. I found it impossible to walk away from. I found it enlightening as well as extremely entertaining. I walked away with a new understanding and outlook. I cannot wait for the next segment. Very well done.<br />Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br />Lynn Y.<BR>     This is a very well written story. I found my self compassionate with each character. Ms. Cary has a gift in her ability to draw the reader into the story and leave you with hope. This story offers readers a littl of everything including romance, intrigue and spirituality. Jennifer does an outstanding job of portraying the sentiment of the era. I was left with a feeling of kinship with Antoine and Louise as well as their friends. It is a message to us in our ability to stay true to each other and our faith. Please hurry with book two.<br />Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br />Tim H is the Director of MWLA, a reviewer and and Author<BR>Lynn Y. is The Managiang Editor of MWLA, an Editor and A Reviewer	2003-11-19

Stephen is a character almost everyone can relate to in one way or another. Which ever way you relate, you will love to hate him. Ian, you are going places. Let us hope there is more where this came from.<br /> Recommendation: RECOMMENDED<br />Lynn Young is the Managing Editor of The MWLA Review, a Reviewer and Editor.	2003-11-19
