With hopes of what tomorrows were to bring, Marley was more than 70% certain that she was making a major mistake.<br /><br />With wedding plans being made, Gerrard was becoming more physically absent and emotionally delinquent from their relationship.  Causing Marley to become fixated in her grooming techniques, which usually resulted in over indulging her purse, shoe and lip stick fetishes.<br /><br />Marley's soul was in a deep disrepair; Her mother's hurting, grandmother is angry, father is absent and her fianc&eacute; didn't care.  All out of hope, joy, strength, resolve and determination, Marley cried out; \\"God what have I done to deserve this?\\"<br /><br />Be still and know that God is God.<br /><br />It was those words that alleviate and allotted for some immediate comfort.  It wasn't until she actually made it to Gilead's Balm, that her eyes, ears, mind and heart were relieved.  `Stop trusting yourself.  Trust in the one who made you.'<br /><br />God Bless you.  Jamellah Ellis sharply perceptive walk through Marley Shepard's eyes was so very pleasing.  I found myself smiling, laughing out loud and riddled with heart wrenching grief.  A wonderfully detailed work on life and establishing an independent relationship with God.	2005-07-31

Residents of Hotlanta, Christian and Mia are married with their adorable contribution of love, Lyric.<br /><br />Things couldn't be going better in their lives.  Granted Christian did give up the most, he lost his adopted family, The Matthew's and his brotherfriend Brice.  Ya'll remember Brice right?  He was Christian's best friend; and Mia's ex-husband.<br /><br />As luck would have it, Brice is looking to re-establish the friendship/relationship that they all once relished in.<br /><br />After all it's been five long years.  Brice was a different man, with his \\"own\\" views of relationships and marriage.  He's remorseful on the way things ended between him, Christian, and Mia.  Brice is blissfully married, to a young woman that knows her role as his wife.  Kree loves her husband, and understands, and more importantly respects the boundaries of their love.<br /><br />Can these long lost friends recover from the haunting past that they share, or will love and desire cause these families, couples, and friends to spiral out of control with too many Loose Ends?<br /><br />I have to admit, I was very skeptical about reading the continuance of The Ties that Bind.  Though it was a strong read, it still lacked substance.  HOWEVER, Loose Ends seem to rouse some of the missing oomph with the sweetest taboo.	2005-07-26

Speaking about betrayal, pain, and disappointments.  With the reader anticipating his role...<br /><br />Mia, a 22 year-old college student home for the summer.  She attends her neighbors barbecue where she meets, and flirts with an older guy who is FINE!<br /><br />Brice- a 30 year-old marine on a months leave.  He's at his cousins enjoying a competitive card game when in that moment he's induced by an electric personality.<br /><br />Sometimes the only way to live- is to live, and learn from those mistakes.  After a month of laughing, talking, kissing and much more, I do's were exchanged.  Mr. & Mrs. Matthew were headed back to Fayetteville, North Carolina to live happily ever after.<br /><br />Happy that the single scene was a thing of the past.  In love with the thought of having someone to come home to.  BOTH with visions of a marriage not parallel to the others.<br /><br />FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE...<br /><br />Christian, a friend, raised in the Matthews' home.  Surprised by the abrupt change in his friends marital status.  As time would pass his role would be babysitting Mia for Brice, and a catalyst in their relationship.<br /><br />As life, and its sacrifices for love become too great.  Mia finds that her innocent flirting may get her in over her head.  With Brice trying to be a good husband, it's up to Christian to decide to keep things quiet.<br /><br />Although The Ties That Bind deal with very painful realities of abuse, and the stigma of such, I think this story may have been written with a younger audience in mind.  If I would've read one more time how cute Mia was, and how fine Brice is, and lord how cute Christian is yet he doesn't know it.  It was hard to grasp the fullness of the story thanks to the tedium.<br /><br />F.Y.I<br />A marriage license isn't ownership.  If independence is frowned on, and physical abuse is prevalent, you need to definitely check out of that relationship.  If you don't love you, then who will?	2005-07-20

Not only is he re-married, he's back as the preacher of another prominent church and he's up to his old ways!<br /><br />You constantly fight with yourself to do right and when you do wrong, you 180 degrees to the wrong! Who of us hasn't fallen short?<br /><br />TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING moves a little slow at times, although very predictable and dare I say the exact same storyline as CASTING THE FIRST STONE, you're interested as to how Pastor Black will resolve his current situation. Juggling a new wife, whose naivet&eacute; isn't lasting as long as he hoped, his crazy ex-lover Adrienne, his second baby mama Charlotte, who has the bedroom on lock, his daughter Alicia, whose seeking his attention, and dare I forget his grip on his outlandish church, home, car, and prestige!<br /><br />What would Curtis do when the cookie crumbles again?	2004-02-13

Vowing never to be locked away in prison again he took his rightful place on top with his team in respected positions to initiate murder, mayhem, muscle, matter, as well as mentality!<br /><br />Bernard James Jr. A.K.A. Dutch wore the crown of the most terrifying force in the streets. Yet, he was \\"R-E-S-P-E-C-T-E-D\\" The balance between being loved and feared.<br /><br />I did in some fashion expect this book to blow my mind, and it might have had Kwame been the author who finished. KWAME, what's up? I was looking to be flabbergasted, as I was when I finished \\"The adventures of Ghetto Sam and The glory of my Demise!\\"<br /><br />After anxiously awaiting my desires to read something as intense those thoughts were doused with little or no effort! The storyline was great, but what happened to \\"THE CLIMAX?\\" Not to mention we still have no clue as to how Bernard James Jr. became known in the streets as THE NOTORIOUS DUTCH? I'm guessing seeing that it's a trilogy we'll find out!<br /><br />In the event I'm bidding for Kwame's writing skills, and mastermind to fulfill me. It did somewhat hold my interest and just on Kwame strength it gets 4 stars, could've been so much more...............	2004-01-20

It took too long to get to all of the secrets and through all of the denials and the end was too far away.<br /><br />A MAN MOST WORTHY is a based on before, after and once again. Two childhood friends Josephine and John, hook back up after John Sebastian moves back to New Jersey.  Jules Anthony, John's close friend and their mentor, Mr. Duke, knew that it had been seven long years since John has really been loved.  They both set idly by as John played house with some chick named Scent (short for Millicent).<br /><br />Gloria is a prosperous, business savvy sister with that, `tell it like it is' syndrome.  She loves her girl, Josephine, but doesn't understand how her girl let's her boozhee husband, who doesn't make her release, hold such a significant power over her!<br /><br />In retrospect, Josephine, hates her boss, but loves her job.  She loves her marriage, but hates her husband.

I read the first chapter on three occasions and I finally decided to set aside the time and read it. THE DYING GROUND fooled me in a good way.  It wasn't HIP-HOP like I'd read, but instead a mystery littered with question after question.  The characters, plot and depiction are so very real making you feel as though you are right in California as the story takes place.<br /><br />THE DYING GROUND is Nichelle D. Tramble's first novel.

In reading Zane's books her characters are all the same.  Two sets of friends meet two sets of friends at a club.  The set of friends who have their lives in the right direction are the two that hook up right!  Geren and Tempest fall in lust with one another and they have some really good sex while trying to work in a relationship. She's kind of superficial, which isn't cool seeing how her girl lives in the jects and she has no other friends!  They both have secrets (HOW ORIGINAL FOR ZANE'S CHARACTERS!)<br /><br />Okay now their friends Janessa and Dvonte hook up.  But it's more for sex.  He's not trying to fall in love and she played herself from the beginning.  The girl works for the post office and lives with her parents in the jects!  WHY?<br /><br />HEAT SEEKERS is supposed to be a romance novel?  The only romantic notion was when Geren washed Tempest's hair.  Otherwise HEAT SEEKERS is all about sex.  I only finished it because I started it.	2003-04-24

That's real cool because I don't think friendships should end.<br /><br />Kyle is obviously the leader, he gets married first (white girl) and he owns a successful black business. His whole world changes when he's falsely accused by a racist cop. He can't have sex with his wife; he goes all the way to Africa leaving his family to find himself! Where was he when he was stepping into this relationship?<br /><br />OKAY Jay, the supposed playa in the group, who married a woman he didn't love because she was having his baby! WHEN WAS THIS WRITTEN? That's why you should use condoms. Jay is foul he has very little respect for himself and falls for anything.  He gets turned out by a young girl whose father straight punks him! His wife finally gets a clue and gets her a man on the side and that's when he wants to come home. He wouldn't have lasted that long.<br /><br />Will's girl is off the chain, she's a big girl with a big attitude and she makes him stand his ground because he seems to be a little soft allowing Jay to manipulate him!  Exactly how old are they?<br /><br />ALLEN is a punk! No one has love for a mama's boy! His broad was as grimy as they come.  She used her talk to get this man money; she took his mama's life, had him raising another man's child, and all his boys had her!  Really where do these people live? A mama's boy won't allow for anyone to dis mama let alone kill her! She all of a sudden got pregnant dude where was you cause she rationed it out?<br /><br />MARRIED MEN has some humor, but it's not a realistic depiction in my eyes.  Although I know you're always growing, it seems like these characters are always stumbling.	2003-04-24

The words used by Antonne M. Jones to describe hustling were simply remarkable and you would have to honestly have a love for words in order to understand the jargon that this man brings to the table. I fell instantly in love when I saw that he was able to transform the hustler's creed into a work of art. I love words and all of his were perfect, he was gritty by the English language.<br /><br />Although THE FAMILY: A PHILADELPHIA MOB STORY is short, it depicts a friendship that was formed to give the men work. It was a rise to the top, filled with gang rivals, knowledge, sex, greed and of course the take down of an empire.<br /><br />THE FAMILY: A PHILADELPHIA MOB STORY This book is a realization filled with knowledge.  It didn't focus on the actual living, but it was to the point and showed you how it came, how it flourished and how it ended.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading.	2003-04-03

In A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT, you find a family boggled down with secrets, infidelity, rape/molestation, drug abuse, teen sex, sexuality and envy. This is everyone's family! Where did this woman emerge from? McMillan has captivated me with every single book! Not one complaint and I am hoping that she continues to write and continues to create characters that people can relate to.<br /><br />Viola, the mother, is the strength of this entire family; even when in relation to her ex-husband and his new family. Viola sees all and hears all and that's without one word being said, now that's a real mother!  Even after death, Viola, is there to help all of them mend the pieces and shows them how special they all are and how to utilize that special gifts they each have.<br /><br />A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT is truly a portrayal of a real family and I read it with a box of Kleenex.	2003-04-03

A group of us decided to reread the story to see if it would have the same impact on as mature women.  I have never reread a book before.  I was under the impression that doing so the story wouldn't be as interesting and predictable.  As key parts of the story, the line up from the movie played out, I could actually hear Whitney Houston, Lela Rochon, Loretta Devine and Angela Bassett's voices.<br /><br />Savannah has decided it's time to leave Denver.  She's hoping that even though she's taking a pay cut, that life in Phoenix will be very different for her, especially in the love department.<br /><br />Bernadine's husband, John, has just informed her after eleven years of marriage that he wants a divorce.  While she wasn't happily invested in their marriage, she never expected that he'd bail on her.<br /><br />Robin has been doing every single thing she could think to find a man to love her.  Each man she believes is the one has some sort of affliction or another.<br /><br />Gloria has spent her entire adult life raising her son, Tarik, and running her beauty salon, the Oasis.<br /><br />Successful in business, the women are all dealing with issues ranging from weight, caring for their parents, low self-esteem, single parenting, and stupid exes. The friends learn to navigate through it all and support one another.<br /><br />What I absolutely love about WAITING TO EXHALE is that McMillan allows you to see the women in different stages and witness their growth.  While desperation is the obvious fear, they all learn to love themselves, which is a very important lesson for all women.	2003-04-03
