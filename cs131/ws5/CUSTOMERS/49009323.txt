It had a profound effect on me.  Eagle Man has stepped forward in the spirit of White Buffalo Calf Woman to bring the teachings of the earth to all people.  Many enrolled Indians are unconfortable with their cultures being shared.  While we respect their culture and tradition, not being born into a certain tradition does not mean you are not meant to be affected by it in a positive way.  And that is what this book does.  To bring forward the beauty of the earth path as seen from the Lakota traditions.<br /><br />If you are interested in Lakota spirituality (i.e. the gifts of White Buffalo Calf Woman) then be sure to also check out Black Elk Speaks and The Gift of the Sacred Pipe.  Black Elk was a Lakota holy man who saw that the traditions of his people were under threat.  So he communicated the information about the Lakota rituals/rites to white men he made friends with.<br /><br />In this book you really get a sense of the spirit of friendship and sacredness.  You can realize that the gifts of spirit and earth, that are found in many traditions, are for the healing of all beings and the peaceful friendship of all peoples.  This book does a great job in conveying that spirit.	2005-01-25

The reading here is very dated.  What he presents is a stripped down version (antiseptic) of some techniques for journeying. But Harner's philosophy is pretty locked into what drum-beat rhythms work and this is simply not true, not required to do shamanic journeys.  You will get a very slanted almost confined view.  And that is the antithesis to shamanism in general.<br /><br />Shamanism is best accessed, especially for the beginner, within some cultural context and Harner has cleansed his techniques away from their cultures.  Even his views (and his disciples Ingerman) on soul retrieval are still changing due to lack of root within cultural context.<br /><br />If you are new to shamanism then start instead with The Book of the Shaman by Nicholas Wood.  If you are into some healing aspects then goto Shaman, Healer, Sage by Villoldo or Woman who glows in the dark by Elena Avila.	2005-01-24

But it is not a work focusing on the mystical or healing side of shamanism.  The language is a bit too academic, even clinical, for shamanic work.  The author refers to psychological principles and Carl Jung too many times.<br /><br />If you are interested in Shamanism you should first spend lots of time outdoors connecting with nature.  The Book of the Shaman by Nicholas Wood is a great overview if you have not read about shamanism before.  If you want more advanced information from books then look to Carlos Castenada or Ted Andrews (Animal-speak, but not the other magical stuff he does).  Serge Khali King's Urban Shaman is worth a read as well.  Woman Who Glows in the Dark by Elena Avila has some great information.<br /><br />I can't recommend Ingerman or Harner because they are the same school and are a bit rigid related to technique of drumming and are still learning/changing their minds about technique in soul retrieval.  I feel that their techiques are dated and not widely influenced by traditional shamanism.  I have not found solid 'advanced' Toltec information yet including Don Miguel Ruiz or Theun Mares.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in Huna (Hawaiin Mysticism) then Fundamentals of Hawaiian Mysticism by Charlotte Berney is the best overview.	2005-01-19

Through examples from the oral tradition of The People, through interviews, speeches, prayers, songs and conversations, these ways will be explored.<br /><br />The material in this textbook will attempt to describe, not intrude by analysis, the meaning, role and function of sacred traditional practices and observances in the lives of The People, individually and collectively. This textbook will perhaps also help to correct the misinformed views of Native American sacred traditions and observances. These views fill the archives, the libraries, the movies, and the textbooks students use throughout the world. By simply letting The People speak we may come to better understand the profoundness of strength, beauty, and vitality of this dimension of American Indian People.<br /><br />Many Native People find it difficult to explain their ways of life, beliefs, traditions, and observances with the word \\"religion\\" Therefore, we tried to find a word that would better describe sources of life and ways of knowledge. For this reason we chose the word sacred which we will define in more detail later on in this chapter. (page 3)<br /><br />The Path of Life<br /><br />The place from which you had started at the beginning seemingly a long time ago, will now appear very close as if you had started but recently.<br /><br />Within several religions around the world is the philosophy or idea that life is envisioned as a path or road. The terrain through which it winds and goes is representative of the pitfalls, or turns of life one must encounter as one travels the \\"road of life.\\" This is made explicit in the ceremony, like the Mide of the Winnebago. The above quote comes from this ceremony.<br /><br />At the root of Native American aboriginal concepts is the belief that the road conveys an eternal return. There is no end. At death one returns in some way to the beginning. On the path of life, when one has reached old age, one knows what one knew when one was born, but only realizes and acknowledges it for the first time. The concept is at the root of aboriginal beliefs because like the road, the \\"sacred\\" had no beginning or end. The road is continuous and never ending. ...<br /><br />In Peyotism, the Peyote \\"road\\" is also discussed. An explanation, metaphorically, is given about the altar of a crescent moon.<br /><br />At the west corner, horns to the east, is the crescent altar with a groove or \\"path\\" along it from horn to horn, interrupted by a flat space in the center where the \\"father peyote\\" is later to rest on springs of sage. The \\"path\\" symbolizes man's path from birth (southern tip) to the crest of maturity and knowledge (at the place of the peyote) and thence downward again to the ground through old age to death (northern tip).<br /><br />The priest swung a pointing finger along a narrow groove running through the crest of the altar moon. \\"You follow life's road,: he explained to me, \\"then you meet peyote, and your life changes. It has for everyone in here. We meet peyote and then we continue in that Way.\\"<br /><br />Through these roads or paths life is given more meaning, purpose, and responsibility. We also find that these roads provide means or procedures by which the people may attain or achieve certain desired goals. This is the role of religions. The path of life is analogous to this role. (page 197)<br /><br />The Peyote Spirit<br /><br />We have been taught that all men have the right to worship God in the manner and form most satisfactory to their own conscience. (Osage Peyotists)<br /><br />The definitions of Peyote are multi-faceted and varying. It depends, of course, on whom one asks and their knowledge, or experience with Peyote. Obviously many interpretations will range from the abstract, personal, and emotional to an objective concrete, scientific explanation.<br /><br />Examples of the abstract are:<br /><br />Peyote is a power.There is a power in there. That power, he has many names. You don't know how much power is there. It will take all your lifetime and you will know only a small part of the power. This is what I was told.<br /><br />This description comes from a young Navajo man, Ron Barton, who was introduced to Peyote as a small child and has since made a commitment to it. Larry Etsitty, also a Navajo and Vice-President of the Navajoland Native American Church defines Peyote in this way,<br /><br />The Peyote to me, is my bible. I know what I should be doing and shouldn't be doing. To me, when I take that Peyote, I feel humble (respectful) all the time.<br /><br />Peyote has always been a religion. It is used mainly to gain power. (Manuel Watchman, Navajo) (page 233)<br /><br />The Peyote experience is one of individual meditation and consequently, revelation. Prayer and contemplation provide reasonable access, through Peyote, to satisfying revelations about one's self. Shirly Etsitty explains further, \\"The fundamental teaching is as a sacrament . . ., it (Peyote) is the mediator. When you take the medicine, you learn from inside out.\\" Change is inevitable, according to one's conscience and confrontation with himself. Change for the better becomes possible, necessary, and worthwhile. However, the change must be within the individual, as his environment does not visibly alter. While he cannot usually control conditions that affect him, he can influence and exercise more controls within his own life. His outlook, philosophically, and behavior adjusts accordingly. (pages 245-246)<br /><br />Christianity and the Peyote Religion<br /><br />Emhoolah who has spent part of his life from childhood with \\"Peyote People\\" says, \\"I've gone to Christian Churches. I always come back. There must be something about that herb that appeals to the Indian.\\" Ron Barton echoes the sentiment, \\"I've been involved in the Native American Church all my life, since I was born. It's in me. It will always be in me. I like the Peyote Way. I pray that way. I eat that way. I sleep that way. I live that way. It puts back the dignity.\\" Sam Gardipe talking about tradition and its place in a fast-moving technologically oriented world, shared his philosophy as Peyotist, and as an Indian. \\"I have a philosophy. One of the ways of rebelling, is to be traditional, to really know your own way (Peyote Way).\\"<br /><br />To reiterate, Larry Etsitty also acknowledges that the bird he envisions can also go in the direction of Christianity. He sees Peyotism as being adaptable, supplemental and not detrimental to any other religion, including Christianity. It is acknowledged that the Native American Church in its contemporary form contains seeds of Christianity, incorporated either recently or in some cases before the 20th century.<br /><br />The Peyote Religion functioned as separate independent groups prior to the organization of specific groups into the affiliated Native American Church. In doing so, some groups also introduced characteristics and the concept of Christianity. Other groups did not attempt to introduce change or did not reorganize themselves. (pages 247-248)<br /><br />The Peyote Way or Peyote Road stresses four main teachings one must conform and adhere to. \\"Peyote People\\" may supply the instruction, or after Peyote is consumed it may be directly responsible for teaching. The teachings are: (1) Love for your fellow man or brotherly love; (2) responsibility for one's family; (3) self-reliance; and (4) refraining from use of alcohol. ...<br /><br />Larry Etsitty stated with regard to children that he had been told by other members of the Native American Church (not of the Navajoland chapter or branch) that it delighted them to see children participate. Their age ranged from infants to expectant parents. Larry Etsitty continued, \\"They said they felt that's where they went wrong. At times when there were too many participants, the young ones were requested to leave to make roomfor older participants.\\" He indicated that these people regretted that their young ones have not responded in the desired manner. As to the women in Peyotism, depending on the area and the time, it was once recorded they were sometimes not allowed to participate. Most tribes, as oral tradition indicates, gave the women a very high place in the Peyote Religion and usually credit her for the bringing of Peyote. The Navajo tribe is one of the very, very few who allow women to sing during the meeting. (pages 249-250)<br /><br />In the Summer of 1975, the author met an elderly man at the Navajo Tribal Fair in Window Rock, Arizona. He was a golden man, all sparkly, dark skin and eyes, in the sun. He was obviously not wealthy in ways of money and extravagant finery. He and his clothes were all wrinkly and worn. Both had bags in them. He stepped up to negotiate a purchase he planned. He wanted the man's robe or sheet, half red and half black, worn in the Peyote meeting. He said he was a road man, had been one for forty years. He said he'd been to jail for Peyote, was there when Peyote followers were harassed. He said it simply and matter-of-factly. \\"Peyotism had endured.\\" He said that softly, gently in Navajo. He said he would do it all over again.as born. It's in me. It will always be in me. I like the Peyote Way. I pray that way. I eat that way. I sleep that way. I live that way.

Good background on the authors life as it relates to the subject. Nice writing style overall in the beginning.  Along with the meeting of the bee master and wisdom flowing like honey.  The novice undergoes the 23 day hibernation/initiation transported by visions of transformation into the mind of the bee and the hive.<br /><br />Then the story falls apart.<br /><br />After the initiation the initiate meets the bee mistress and her enchanting apprentices.  At this point the writing becomes chaotic and you end up with people smearing our heros naked body with honey so he can have some kind of ritualized sexathon with one (or more) of the bee mistresses.<br /><br />This story had great promise but literally fell apart half way through. I consider it either a misguided set of sex fiction or a really weird sex cult.  Too bad.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book on genuine Shamanic experience then try Jungle Medicine by Connie/Constance Grauds.  That is a potent, powerful, and poetic prose.	2004-11-05

However the quality of writing, though well researched, does not inspire. You don't find yourself absorbed in the writing, just reading facts and stories.<br /><br />There are a few practices buried within the book but they are buried. There should have been seperate areas to emphasize these practices. As an example of the writing style the chapter on healing and death talks about death and how shamans approach it for along time. Then the story about how animals created diseases and how plants offered to help people is relayed. Then the content switches back to the death topic again. The writing shows a general lack of polish and very much lacks telling you how to enter the sacred relationship yourself.<br /><br />A good book, but did not live up to its potential.	2004-07-14

However the concepts in this book are all over the place and lack any coherant grounding into the Mayan Calendar.  Occasionally facts about the Mayan Long count are presented in error.<br /><br />More often imagined correspondences and inventions such as 'The Loom Of The Maya' are presented as cosmic fact when they are products of Joe's imagination.  Joe is a great artist and should present himself as such and not apostle of the next Baktun.  The only way you could believe you are reading truth here is if you allow yourself to turn off discrimination and accept whatever wild stuff he says.<br /><br />I have no doubt that Joe, has opened himself up to either off-world information and/or the depths of his own imagination.  But this 'artistic' plethora was never grounded either in historical facts about the Mayan nor in logical thinking.  The work remains a very loose artistic interpretation with Mayan influences.<br /><br />Example from this book: \\"Instantaneously releasing themselves through chromo-molecular transport into the farther reacher of the galaxy into whence they had come, the Mayan sages nonetheless also prepared for a return.\\"<br /><br />Ok, that one had the word Maya in it.  But where does this concept of chromo-molecular transport come from?  We have no evidence of this concept in Maya life either past or present.  It, like much other in this book, comes from Joes imagination.<br /><br />Ultimately and unfortunately Mr Arguelles became convinced of his identity as a reincarnated Pacal Votan (Lord of Time) and created another system of Mayan glyphs called the Dreamspell.  Dreamspell is not based on the pure interpretation of the Mayan Tzolkin.  It is an invention that detracts from the original Mayan teachings.<br /><br />So while the book does provide some interesting, if not incomprehensible, introduction to the Mayan calendar it is based on imagined predicates of what later becomes an incomprehensible Dreamspell system.  The author has been changing this concept and his websites almost continually.<br /><br />More authentic sources on this subject are John Major Jenkins, Barbara Tedlock, and Carl Johan Calleman.  In fact Calleman can be considered a disciple of Arguelles.  Callemans  'Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time: The Mayan Calendar'  and  'The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness' form the crux of an authentic system of study and understanding based partly on MAYAN galactic concepts.  However even Calleman provides a mix of Mayan and non-Mayan concepts without letting you know which is which.  So you could call Callemans 'The Mayan Calendar And The Transformation Of Consciouss' by another name as 'The Mayan Factor 2'.n incomprehensible Dreamspell system.

The premise of the book was supposed to be (from what I understood) the Return of the Serpents of Wisdom (a group of enlightened beings possibility of extraterrestrial origin).  That's not what this book is about.<br />The author says he was initiated into an order of serpent wisdom from Mesoamerica by Anton Ponce De Leon Paiva (see The Wisdom of the Ancient One: An Inca Initiation).  So you would think this book is information about the *Return* of those people to the earth either literally or figuratively.<br />Instead this book talks about all manner of cultural appearances of snakes, serpents, and dragons regardless of the degree of their association to the serpent masters.  There are even some very dark figures in this book such as the magical dragon baphomet whom monotheistic readers would object to as a blatant depiction of satan (who is not usually considered an enlightened being).<br />Although the book shows very serious research it looses much credibility by including things like a copy of the supposed image of Sananda (Jesus) taken in Mexico by an archeologist in 1961 (which in this reviewers opinion is clearly a painting).  It causes this book to associate to the same level of authenticity as the Cottingly fairy hoax of the 1920s.<br />So while the breadth of this book as a historical survey of all things serpenty is admirable, it's ability to stay within the context of a group of enlightened masters has failed.  The associations the author attempts to make with any appearance of a snake, serpent, or dragon to some universal brotherhood of enlightened masters ranges from possible to tenuous to fictional.<br />If you want up to date information on the serpent masters there are much better works out there.  Amoung them is Return of the Children of Light: Incan and Mayan Prophecies for a New World by Judith Bluestone Polich.  This book is a better blend of myth, history, current scientific research, and future esoteric possibilities.

If you have not learned much about spirituality outside of mainstream religion then this book will be valuable to you.<br /><br />If you have been on the spiritual path of 'you' for awhile, there is not much new stuff here. The real heart of the advanced stuff, or nearly so, is in the very end of the book. The four ascension attitudes of Appreciation, Gratitude, Love, and Direct Cognition are the core of the intro to Ascension and the Ishayas teachings. It is too bad that these concepts were not introduced more clearly at the beginning of the book and used as chapter themes throughout. An opportunity surely missed to make this a better book. Like how do I remain in Appreciation when things happen in my life, etc.<br /><br />The material on the 27 spheres in the APPENDIX is very interesting. It too should have formed the core of the book. With the good stuff buried in the back most of the book is kinda mushy and light. As is the book might be best for a teenager or someone in their twenties. I hope the Ishaya teachers write something more substantitive.	2004-04-15

Once you get past that (which appears again in the rear of the book) you realize this book does not teach you TM (so why is it in the title?).<br />There are some helpful things in this book especially if you are new to the spiritual path.  But if you are looking for a serious book on meditation in general look elsewhere.  This is more on the 'so how are you doing now after learning TM' side.	2004-04-02

A little Reiki, Alchemy, Shamanism, Intuitive work, spirit helpers, etc.  She does a nice job of introducing concepts and making the material very accessible.  This is a great introduction to a practical spirituality in general.<br />However, if you have had some experience in a few of these areas then Nicki really does not have a work with depth to make this a really meaningful resource.  She does not go enough into Alchemy or Shamanism or the Elements for example to give you insights beyond a cursory and somewhat shallow introduction.<br />While I have great respect for her and what is trying to do in this synthesis, I feel that she spends too much time on fluff and not enough in the details.  She does not really provide enough to successfully give Alchemical Healing it's unique fingerprint as a healing modality.<br />A great beginners read but not that useful for someone who wants to get into these topics in detail.<br />As examples see the following books for more information on some of Nicki's topics:<br />Elements - Healing With Form, Energy and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen<br /><br />Shamanism - The Shaman's Body : A New Shamanism for Transforming Health, Relationships, and the Community<br />OR<br />Chosen by the Spirits: Following Your Shamanic Calling<br />Alchemy - The Emerald Tablets of Thoth The Atlantean	2004-03-31

This is a very good overview on the general/traditional technique of Soul Retrieval.  There are a bit too many examples of client studies and perhaps not enough analysis of the spiritual things which occurred.  What is most disturbing is that in the preface the author says something completely contradictory to the rest of the book regarding how to restore the soul part once retrieved.<br />Perhaps this book demonstrates most clearly the current tension and change in the area of soul retrieval.  In general, the formal patterns of shamanism, including the use of drumming being necessary to achieve trance states, are under question and being challenged.  Many people today are able to enter shamanic states of consciousness through concentration alone.  As more people become capable of shamanic techniques the older assumptions will be modified and fall away.<br />This book is a good representative of the more formal ideas about soul retrieval how they were understood perhaps ten or twenty years ago.  If you read this just remember that it is your awareness and attention that are the real keys to opening to shamanic experiences, not being constrained to specific static techniques.	2003-04-23

This book has very little about the philosophy of the Essenes and even less about the life of Christ. Based on the little amount of the speaking of Christ in this book, the title is very misleading.  It is really a fictional account of a boy who is trained in the ways of the Essenes and later becomes a disciple of Christ.  While there is some good spiritual imagery painted from time to time for the most part the book is drab and unconvincing.<br />Little, if anything, of the knowledge held by the Essenes has survived till today. It is even in doubt how much, if any, contact Jesus has with the Essenes.  Slightly (only slightly) more realistic are the works of Edmond Bordeaux Szekely.  More convincing accounts of Christs life based on Akashic records are found in The Aquarian Gospel Of Jesus The Christ by Levi H. Dowling.	2002-04-21

However, if you have spent any time becoming familiar with other contemplative traditions (Buddhism) or practices (meditation) then this book will not have that much to offer.  Much of what the author says are common themes in other approaches besides Sufism.

The emphasis on 'holes' and the denegration of the personality make the 'work' hard to accept.

There is almost nothing on Sufi methods of healing.  Since this book is titled 'The Art of Sufi Healing' if you are looking for the actual *methods* or *art* of Sufi Healing, you will be very disappointed with this book.<br />Very little of the book talks about the nature of the body and the causes of disease and methods of healing.  The author does not display any detailed knowledge of Sufi healing methods.  Certainly nothing that would allow someone interested in being a healer to be able to apply.  Most of the first part of this book is common information in alternative healing circles and available on the Internet.  No reason to buy this book for that information.<br />The majority of the book is a collection of practices, meditation, whirling, stretching, etc.  aimed at keeping someone healthy. Again, this information is not about healing.  It seems the author had not achieved enough experience in specific Sufi healing methods to arrive at a meaningful synthesis in this book.  The information that is presented is cursory, based on an Islamic Sufism order.  There are other Sufi orders, including the Sufi Healing order, which possess much more meaning knowledge of 'The Art of Sufi Healing' than is presented here.	2001-12-12

I bought it to help me work out some heart issues of my own and become more loving.  But this book fails.<br />Elizabeth and Patricia present a non-cohesive blend of quotes from spiritual sources and peoples experiences.  Right from the start the tone is all fuzzy, feely good and whatnot.  Maybe that's light conversation to have with a friend over brunch but its not the kind of stuff I want to pay for.<br />There is no clear explanation from the start on what is your heart, both spiritually and physically.  No outline of why a strong and loving heart is important. No description of symptoms for a heart that functions properly or not.  This book takes you on a smorgasboard of quotations from spritual and personal sources which never really progresses anywhere. There is no alchemy and you may loose touch with your heart as you get lost in so many words with no clear structure. And the bits here and there about...'El Moyra' and the like are out of place. She should be laying out a real workbook for heart transformation...<br />In the end, this book does not really help you give and recieve more love.  For that I recommend spending time with the words of Mother Teresa or some of the other sources cited in this book directly. There is not much to gain here from the unclear mixture of references and experiences presented in this work.	2001-11-18

His books have been a trail of hit and, mostly miss, wanderings.<br />He recognizes a common source for spiritual reality.  And yet he pushes an ecumenical (and even New-Age) agenda to try and mold all existing beliefs into a vision that it cannot be.  'Only if the religions of the world would stand together...'  These religions are organizations with their own agendas and systems. Perhaps Fox should listen to the Dali Lami who said that ultimately there is no reconciliation between the *religions* of Buddhism and Christianity.  There may be one spirit, but not a single religion or even meaningful coordination of them.  (Vivikenanda says that would be very boring.)<br />Mysticism is the root of all real spiritual experience and Fox knows this.  But each religion is an outgrowth (and hence not true development) of the founder who had the mystical experience.  The goal of any true (spiritual) path is personal experience.  Fox keeps attempting to join all religions (forms) into a great ecumenical mandala and this cannot be done. Personal experience is always unique. It is wisdom that we can see from other beliefs. But Fox keeps on pushing in yet another book.<br />To be perfectly clear, his inclusion of various spiritual and mystical source in this book is commendable.  Everyone else is realizing wisdom of many sources so why not M.Fox.  However his approach is always one of 'Look how great what I am saying is'.  He claims great visions and breakthroughs for humanity if we will just believe what he is saying.  Check his past books. He always does this.<br />The inclusion and recognition of various sources does not, in his writings, yield meaningful synthesis.  This is because there is no coherent meaning to be achieved through shallow or 'deep' ecumenism (joining of outward forms).  Neither by dancing, or having estatic sex, or by bringing in ethics or spirituality to work (all themes of his).  Neither volumes of writing nor diversity of inputs has meaning on its own. There is no substantial vision presented in his works that rises above religion (form) and beyond his own (elevated) concepts of how things should be.  His previous books have not resulted in major changes to society and it does not appear this one will have much effect either.lumes of writing nor diversity of inputs has meaning on its own.

This book does a very good job in outlining the Shamanic experience and where this mindset intersects (quite strongly) with Celtic ways. The parallels are brought out strongly and the progression of the book is nearly flawless. The book does an execellent job is emphasizing that the demystification we are suffering from is addressed nicely by aspects of both Shamanism and Celtic spirituality. If the book was consistent in its approach it would have deserved five stars.<br />The main problem I have with this book is that the author spends too much time on being an apologist (or promoter) for witchcraft and magic. (Check the authors other books and you will see why this is the case.) Certainly aspects of wicca and witchcraft in general are etched into Celtic myth and history. But the authors own biases bring this area up to a level not fitting with the subject of this book. Most of the chapter on 'The Soul of Nature' brings out details of witchcraft generally not supportive of the main thesis. More than occasional references to the tarot, magic, and other mystical/occult topics off subject leave the reader wondering why so much time is spent on things outside the universal/traditional shamanic experience.<br />A worthwhile and almost required reading for anyone interested in Shamanism and Celtic spirituality. The noted flaws keep the book from being an indispensable and serious academic contribution to the subject.	2001-08-30

The author has some really good information which is pretty convincing.  However, many points are not proven clearly enough and opposing viewpoints are at times brushed over without emphatic refutation.  Some of the worst points about the book are that some important information or suppositions are buried in the text.  There are also signs of abrupt transitions in thinking and theme.  Some of the wording is not clear or un-edited.  The word 'briefer' appears in the text and at time certain words (like 'certain') appear in the same sentence twice where alternate wording should have been used.<br />The only way you could see no value in the book is if you have a completely closed mind and hold a fundamentalist/literal view of creation or by taking the evolutionary belief system which holds no interaction of God in directing the creation.	2000-11-01
