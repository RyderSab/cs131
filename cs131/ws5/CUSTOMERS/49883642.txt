A Novel of Discworld	Books	5	4	6	N	N	All the Things Pratchett Does	&#65279;The first thing Terry Pratchett did, he created Discworld.<br /><br />The second thing Terry Pratchett did, he created Sam Vimes.<br /><br />The third thing Terry Pratchett did, he created animosity amongst \\"shapes\\" (i.e. species).<br /><br />The fourth thing Terry Pratchett did, he made us laugh at all of it!<br /><br />If you're new to the Discworld series, let me welcome you and recommend that you start here.<br /><br />It's an excellent way to get your feet wet, as it were, and into the mind of this wonderfully<br /><br />twisted author.<br /><br />You'll first run into Commander-of-the-Watch Sam Vimes, just a man trying to get through a<br /><br />rough stint in the Discworld city of Ankh-Morpork, a place inhabited by Trolls, Dwarves, Men,<br /><br />Vampires, Ghouls, Werewolves, and plenty of other strange beings. And they're all trying to live<br /><br />peacefully (at least as peacefully at they can) together. But problems quickly surface as<br /><br />Commander Vimes and his fellow Watch Officers discover that a murder of a rather famous<br /><br />Dwarf may have taken place. And the Dwarves suspect a Troll did it (they found a Troll's club<br /><br />laying next to the body). Did a Troll do it? Or is this a set-up? Vimes, like a Pitbull clamped onto<br /><br />a bone, won't let go until he finds out for sure.<br /><br />The premise is pretty simple: Murder takes place, detectives are on it, struggle with internal and<br /><br />external problems, solve the case. But in the hands of a master-storyteller like Pratchett, this<br /><br />novel jumps out at you and surprises at almost every turn.<br /><br />One of the things that kept me interested in the story was the animosity toward differing species<br /><br />(or shapes). Dwarves are rather snobbish toward other races, especially the Trolls, whom they<br /><br />have an on-going battle with thanks to Koom Valley (an ancient skirmish location that killed<br /><br />many of both species). This mirrored some less-than-glorious traits that we humans sometimes<br /><br />have toward our OWN species.<br /><br />There was also a nod toward \\"The Godfather\\" in a Troll who runs \\"the docks\\" of Ankh-Morpork<br /><br />and uses violence to further his means. And there's even an advanced palm-pilot that has a green<br /><br />Imp in it that helps Commander Vimes sort out a few problems.<br /><br />We also get a glimpse into the drug culture of Ankh-Morpork via a Troll named Brick who heats<br /><br />up a heroin like substance called Slab and uses it to get himself in all kinds of trouble, including<br /><br />into the middle of Vimes' investigation.<br /><br />Sam Vimes is a good \\"Copper\\", too. He makes sure that he's at home every night by 6pm to read<br /><br />\\"Where's My Cow\\" to his infant son, and he loves his wife - who happens to raise Dragons on<br /><br />the side - dearly (all of which comes into play later on in the story)<br /><br />It's still quite amazing how well all of the plot threads of this story come together. And, like I<br /><br />said earlier, in the hands of an expert story-crafter like Terry Pratchett, it's a piece of cake to<br /><br />read.rd our OWN species. <br /> <br />There was also a nod toward \\"The Godfather\\" in a Troll who runs \\"the docks\\" of Ankh-Morpork <br />and uses violence to further his means.

An unfortunate incident with a wealthy, elderly employee has forced Tully to become a man on the run from the law. And the reader gets to travel with him as he starts his Carribean adventure, plopping us into the middle of beautiful boats, sandy beaches, lighthouses, and parties. We get to meet such strange-named characters as Willie Singer, Noel Christmas, Captain Kirk, Cleopatra, and his trusty horse, Mr. Twain.<br /><br />The adventure really begins with Cleopatra, a 100-year-old millionaire who wants Tully to find a Fresnel lens for her lighthouse. Once Tully takes on the challenge, we take a spin around the Carribean, trying to find it. And thus we begin to bump into some interesting and bizarre characters (Captain Kirk being my favorite). The adventure winds up as Tully, through the help of his friends, finds the lens, avoids capture by some hillbilly bounty hunters, and watches a dear old friend pass away.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />Not being a \\"Parrothead\\", I approached this book simply from an entertainment standpoint, not as a Jimmy Buffett fan. And although I wasn't completely disappointed, there was very little action and many convenient happenings that made the book, at times, frustrating. But that isn't necessarily a horrible thing either. I could see why, however, some readers might not enjoy this style of writing. Whenever Tully got into trouble, there was always something or someone that bailed him easily out of it; very little angst in the story.<br /><br />But what the book DOES have is a very laid-back narrative that, if you're in the right frame of mind, allows you to drift through the story like a sailboat on calm seas. Like I said, it's entertaining enough, you just need to be sitting on a beach with a margarita (\\"Margaritaville\\") in your hand while the waves lap at your sun-soaked feet.

Oh Yes, Yee of Little Faith	Okay, let's imagine for a second that you're depressed about ...something. Your life. Your career. Your family. Whatever. And it's New Years Eve. You may have had bit to drink and this has added to your depression. Suicide might seem like a viable option at this point. So you head up to the roof of \\"Topper's House\\" (i.e., London) and plan on hurling yourself from the top. But wait. There are two more people up here with the same idea. No, make that three, as a guy carrying a pizza just arrived. Is he depressed too? Yep.<br /><br />So now what? Can you do this with an audience? Is there a waiting line to queue into in order to get this sinful act finished?<br /><br />As it turns out, you and your new roof-top companions decide not to kill yourselves. Instead, you form a sort of dysfunctional support group to help each other get by. And you learn a bit about yourself in the process. Meet Martin, a washed-up TV newscaster who slept with a 15-year-old and went to prison. Now he makes his living on a cheesy cable TV talk show that no one watches. He's lost his wife, his children and, most importantly to him, his self-respect.<br /><br />Next, meet Jess, the daughter of a minor minister of education who doesn't fit in anywhere. Her older sister has disappeared and been presumed dead. Her mother and father think she's a freak. And she's a foul-mouthed flunky.<br /><br />Then we have JJ, an American and former rock-n-roll band member who now delivers pizzas for a living. He's lost his girlfriend, his band buddies, and his will to play music.<br /><br />And finally there's Maureen, the mother of an adult invalid who never gets out of the house because she has to constantly care for her son. She has no life, no friends, and limited knowledge of what is out there in the world.<br /><br />Does this sound like the type of support group you'd want to belong to? Whoa!<br /><br />*****************************************************************************<br /><br />Nick Hornby, author of HIGH FIDELITY, gives us a great dark comedy story about these horribly messed up Londoners and how their fateful meeting turns each of their lives around.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This isn't a feel-good, solve-all-of-your-problems kind of story. The resolutions are slow and not always uplifting, but they are insightful and almost always laughable. The solutions to their problems are often found through some of the worst methods (i.e., sleeping with strangers, cussing out healthcare workers, getting a low-paying job, etc.). But they are intriguing characters that you just have to continue reading about, even though it is often painful to see what they do to each other and, ultimately, to themselves.> <br />Nick Hornby, author of HIGH FIDELITY, gives us a great dark comedy story about these horribly messed up Londoners and how their fateful meeting turns each of their lives around.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.

And what I mean by that is that she writes on a level most writers would LOVE to make it to. She's easy to read while, at the same time, having a deep message, and a raucous sense of humor. I got hooked on her years ago when I read BIRD BY BIRD, a book that I still refer to often whenever I need to \\"get real\\" about my own writing life.<br /><br />I was pleased to learn that these are short memoirs of her life, a collection of short stories. The short story form seems to be making a modest comeback, and I loved the fact that a collection of them made it to the New York Times' list, too.<br /><br />But lets get into the meat and potatoes of the book now ...<br /><br />This is a look at Ms. Lamott's life through her own eyes, and she wears everything on her sleeve, including her disdain for the Bush administration, her dislike of young children, her poor motherhood skills, and her struggles with faith. Examples ...<br /><br />Lamott has to deal with the death of her Alzheimer's mother, pulling the urn that contains her mother's ashes out of her closet. And as she does, she reminisces about the final months of her mother's life: \\"Her purse was a weight, ballast; it tethered her to the earth as her mind floated away. It was also health and preparedness, filled with anything you might need. For instance, there were a lot of Band-Aids. You never know when you'll need one, only that in this world, you will.\\"<br /><br />We also have reflections of her faith on her past: \\"I wear Mary for two reasons: Because she helps me remember the song `Let It Be.' And because I used to pray to her as if she were my mother when I was coming down off cocaine. I'd lie in bed beside whatever cute coked-out boyfriend I had at the time, who'd be snoring and muttering while I ground my teeth in the dark.\\"<br /><br />Spiritually, the book has plenty to offer the reader, but it's not overly-done. Words like \\"$h!tty\\" and the \\"F\\" word make their appearances regularly alongside comments about \\"God's will.\\" Although this might sound put-offish, it isn't. Lamott has full control over her prose and uses it to engage the reader on many levels without getting preachy, making us think about the spirit within our own lives by looking at hers.<br /><br />I only gave the book four stars because most staunch Republicans will undoubtedly be angered by Lamott's take on Bush and \\"his administration's war with Iraq.\\" I also felt that, at times, she meandered around a bit too much and got off topic, but this was pretty rare.<br /><br />Still a great book to check out, especially if you're a Lamott fan.ances regularly alongside comments about \\"God's will.\\" Although this might sound put-offish, it isn't.

The Confederates and Unionists are about to have a major battle engagement only a mile from Mrs. McGavick's house, and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest has commandeered her home as a field hospital.<br /><br />Mrs. McGavick - later to become known as THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH - is in mourning over the death of three of her children during a typhoid epidemic. And she spends most of her time in bed letting Mariah, a Creole slave, run the household. But the days of mourning her children come to an abrupt end as she must come to grips with the death of 9,000 soldiers in a single day, and care for the wounded whom blanket every square inch of her floors.<br /><br />One of the injured is a tough and vocal man named Zachariah Cashwell, a Confederate nobody. During the day's bloodshed, Mr. Cashwell did an incredibly brave, heroic, stupid, and suicidal thing: After the color-bearer is killed, he picks up the flag and marches toward the enemy as they shoot at him. But he doesn't receive a scratch. Only after being captured and attempting to escape is he given a near mortal wound from a gunshot. Then he's taken to Mrs. McGavick's field hospital to recover or die. Here the two (McGavick and Cashwell) meet and clash ...and eventually fall in love, even after Mr. Cashwell's leg is amputated. Even though Carrie McGavick is married.<br /><br />What follows is a denying of love, a race to save the graves of those who are buried outside of the McGavick home, and a woman who discovers her purpose in life: to honor the memory of those \\"boys\\" who died that day.<br /><br />*****************************************************************************<br /><br />This is Mr. Hicks' first novel and, luckily, he's chosen to write a historical fiction story. He must have poured over tons of information and had great difficulty deciding what to place in the book and what not to. Thankfully, he's chosen to write about the actual battle. And his prose during these scenes is topnotch; he can describe bloodshed and waste and near insanity and giving up and hanging on, in one graceful paragraph.<br /><br />Where Mr. Hicks has fallen down is plotting. Although this story sheds light on a little known Civil War battle that incurred horrendous losses, it didn't seem to have a point. The love story between Mr. Cashwell and Mrs. McGavick (which takes up a large portion of the book) is never explored or explained. Why did they fall in love in the first place? We don't know.<br /><br />The story seemed to meander between the battle, the hospital, Mrs. McGavick, Mr. Cashwell, General Forrest, and two other lovers whom we only see fleetingly. I mean, I felt kind of lost, as if I were wondering around a story with no aid from the author.<br /><br />But even so, this book will likely be held in high regard by historical enthusiasts as more light is shed upon THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH.hat not to.

Or inspiration in Inspiration, Arizona? These are just three of the eighteen locations that author Brad Herzog visits in STATES OF MIND, his aptly titled and well-written travel memoir. While criss-crossing the United States, the internal worlds of harmony, inspiration, truth or consequences, comfort, pride, hope, triumph, glory, love, justice, bliss, unity, friendship, honor, faith, freedom, wisdom, and joy all collide with their more realistic communities by the same name.<br /><br />The search for these flea speck sized towns becomes an internal quest as Brad and Amy (the author's wife) jump aboard an RV and try to discover their own answers to these almost ethereal locations. And it's quite an enjoyable trip for the reader, too.<br /><br />Mr. Herzog's grasp of human nature and language is admirable and compelling, and pulls the reader into the book with such wondrous passages as: \\"West Virginia was a state conceived by secession, created by war, raised by irreconcilable differences. When the smoke cleared in 1866, the state constructed its first public institution - a lunatic asylum. And in a not entirely unrelated event, a family named Hatfield cultivated an extreme dislike for a family named McCoy.\\"<br /><br />So, as you can see, the author also gets us into some history of the locations we're visiting, which I found refreshing and, as it turned out, necessary to the understanding of how the towns of Hope, Joy, etc. got their names.<br /><br />As we travel with our two wayward souls through these backwoods, we also feel the desperation of the author as he tries (often in vain) to find meaning in the towns via their names. In a hilarious and ultimately sad portion of the book, Mr. Herzog prepares to find inspiration in Inspiration, Arizona, only to find out that the community no longer exists. Is inspiration unattainable if the town of the same name has vanished?<br /><br />My favorite portion of the book, however, was when they roll into Faith, South Dakota, and Mr. Herzog has to confront his own beliefs in God (the town has six churches within a population of 540) as he meets with two ministers to find out how much faith there is in Faith. Getting into the town held its own righteous significance, too, as they encountered golfball sized hail and a swarm of locust: \\"In the story of Exodus, locusts followed hail. I found our succession of plagues that day ironic, it being a journey to Faith and all, and ominous, my faith being in question. Keeping a lookout for boils and frogs, I collected my doubts and looked for the proper outlet for vocalizing and examining them.\\"<br /><br />Although I love the way this author zings his prose at us, I felt pretty let down by the ending. Perhaps the author wasn't sure how to put the book to rest. Or, maybe, that's part of the journey, not knowing, nor wanting, to end it. For a journey, that's fine. But for a book of discovery, I expected something more than simply chatting with a seven-year-old.<br /><br />Even so, this is a great look at small town America and how our own states of mind can take us on a fantastic journey.vorite portion of the book, however, was when they roll into Faith, South Dakota, and Mr. Herzog has to confront his own beliefs in God (the town has six churches within a population of 540) as he meets with two ministers to find out how much faith there is in Faith.

It's enough to drive a 60-year-old man crazy! Or at least into the home of one of his kids.<br /><br />Nora is one of Belly's three surviving children. She has two boys who are handfuls, and a husband who's never home. Now she has to take on a third child, ala Belly, her father. He's a drinking, abusive, stubborn, and contradictory person (just like a two-year-old, but without the beer breath.)<br /><br />Nora's house and Belly's past are like a match and a stick of dynamite. One is bound to eventually find the other.<br /><br />Or are they?<br /><br />********************************************************************************<br /><br />Author Lisa Selin Davis, a confessed creative writing teacher, debuts with a strong narrative novel right out of the shoot. Her prose is often times beautifully flowing if a bit wordy. But she does get the reader right to the heart of the matter, showing us this dysfunctional family in a very intimate way.<br /><br />I had a really hard time rating this book, but settled on four stars because it was just an easy read and had some excellent dialogue and descriptions.<br /><br />But there were problems, the most notable of which was the simple fact that Belly spent only four years in prison, but exclaims on all the changes to \\"his town\\" after his release. This bothered me quite a bit because things don't change that much in four years.<br /><br />The ending, too, is a bit of a let-down, as there is no great message or changes noted in any of the characters.

With mind-bending novels like \\"The Russia House\\" and \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\", Le Carre has proven his metal in every literary sense.<br /><br />But does an author's previous abilities and successes necessarily equate to success now? The answer is an unfortunate \\"No\\".<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First, I noted that the dialogue and characters in \\"Absolute Friends\\" were VERY dated, the writing almost acting as if the author were trying to mine some of that gold he'd dug up during his earlier novels. But here, again, it just seemed dated.<br /><br />And here's why:<br /><br />The story is about two washed-up Cold War spies who reconnect after years of being apart. Shasha is a stubborn fascist who believes that America is the embodiment of evil, while Ted Mundy (the main protagonist) acts as a tour guide to spectacular castles in England. And that's about it. Seriously. There are flashbacks (MANY flashbacks) to their \\"good ole days of spying\\" and why they were doing it. Although both of these men did their deadly jobs (and did them well), they apparently were doing them for entirely different ideologies. But just by listening to their later conversations - which appear first in the book - it's not much of a surprise to the reader (at least it wasn't for me).<br /><br />Most spy novels are action-packed, or at least suspenseful. But here, all we get are the ramblings of two old men reliving their hey-days and making social and political commentary on today's war in Iraq and the corruption of Western style governments. Does that sound interesting to you? If I want commentary on these issues, all I have to do is pick up a newspaper or listen to NPR radio.<br /><br />It took me a long time to get through this book, which speaks volumes about its washed-up style of writing and plodding plot.<br /><br />I still have every respect for Mr. Le Carre and his earlier works. In fact, I have several of his books on my shelves that I'll undoubtedly read again. But this one won't be among them.act, I have several of his books on my shelves that I'll undoubtedly read again.

Hector is growing old? The Argives and Trojans are forming an alliance against the gods (small \\"g\\")? No, we're definitely NOT in the Iliad anymore.<br /><br />When the DNA reconstructed Thomas Hockenberry, Ph.D. from 20th century America is revived in Dan Simmons' first book in this series, \\"Ilium\\", the Homeric scholar could never have imagined that he'd be the cause of a revolution to overthrow the Greek gods of old.<br /><br />Quantum probabilities clash as science, nature, philosophy, literature, theology, and mythology collide in this nearly improbable story that weaves us in and out of multiple storylines and concludes in a typical Simmons fashion.<br /><br />The first storyline is that of the aforementioned scholic Thomas Hockenberry, revived scholar to the illiterate gods of Olympos. But Hockenberry decides to lay his bets with humanity, and dumps the gods, thus causing more quantum-flux problems. Ilium doesn't fall (at least not in any way you could dream it would). Hockenberry becomes Helen of Troy's lover. And the gods are desperately trying to find him so that they can rein him in (i.e., kill him).<br /><br />The second storyline is that of the moravecs, machine/human creatures who are sympathetic to humans but are unsure as to what is happening on Earth. They're advanced creatures with a sharp wit and literary bents that range from Shakespeare to Virgil and Proust.<br /><br />The third storyline follows humanity on Earth. But these are humans of the future, not old-style. These people have nanotechnology embedded in their cells, giving them unique powers (unfortunately they just don't know about them, though, because they're illiterate too).<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />The prose of Mr. Simmons is what'll keep you reading this ...mostly. He also gets you into certain characters' lives so well that you just HAVE to finish the book so that you know what happened to them. Undoubtedly, different readers will have different favorites. My personal ones were Manhmut and Orphu, two moravecs who get involved in all the storylines in mostly hilarious situations thanks to the literature of Shakespeare and Proust.<br /><br />Although Dan Simmons can write EXTREMELY well, at times I felt as if a teacher were lecturing me on ancient literature and poetry.

That's just one example of some of the repetitiveness I found.)<br /><br />The ending was a bit of a let-down, but not overly so.

Frankfurt, Professor of philosophy at Princeton University.<br /><br />This book's rise to fame is strictly based on the author's appearance on the comedy news show 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart. Now I enjoy 'The Daily Show', and absolutely loved \\"America the Book\\" written by Jon Stewart and the other members of that nutty program. But the reason I had such high praise for Mr. Stewart's book was because I laughed and learned, and the book was well put together and insightful - if somewhat bathroom humorish at times. So when my favorite news show seemed to endorse this odd title, I went out and grabbed a copy.<br /><br />Where to begin?<br /><br />Let's start with the title, since that seems to be a buying trigger for some (as it was for me). \\"On Bulls&@t\\" is catchy, no doubt. So when you crack open the pages of this tiny book, you'd expect some extrapolation on bulls@!t's appearance into modern culture, how it's affected us, and what it's like today (or how it's mutated).<br /><br />But once you start to read this incredibly boring treatise on ...I'm not even sure what to call it! At first I thought that maybe the author was poking fun at his own book and his own philosophy. I mean, philosophy itself is inherently inward looking, forcing us to view things in new and often odd ways. If this was Professor Frankfurt's goal, I fear he hasn't accomplished it for a number of reasons:<br /><br />First, the Professor decides to give us a thesaurus-style look at the word \\"bulls@!t\\". He tells us that it is similar (and different) from words like \\"balderdash\\" and \\"humbug\\" and the like. Then the author takes aim at literary references, even putting his ill-aimed sights on Longfellow!<br /><br />Second, we have this ridiculously droll circular reasoning that permeates the book throughout. Example from page 63: `Bulls@!t is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about. Thus the production of bulls@!t is stimulated whenever a person's obligations or opportunities to speak about some topic exceed his knowledge of the facts that are relevant to that topic. This discrepancy is common in public life, where people are frequently impelled - whether by their own propensities or by the demands of others - to speak extensively about matters of which they are to some degree ignorant.'<br /><br />Third, the value of the book ($10.00) isn't worth the amount of information You might see value in giving this book (as a gift) to the office clown because of its witty title, but I'd recommend saving your hard-earned cash. There's no direct quotes or examples of modern day bulls@!t (no social/political commentary) which is a terrible omission. I think the Professor was trying to avoid personal strife by leaving these items out, but in so doing lost credibility. There are also no quirky antics or phrases that'll catch you off-guard; in short, something with very little monetary or cerebral value.<br /><br />Fourth (and I have to point this out), is that many people probably feel this book is beyond them because it deals with \\"philosophy\\" and was written by a \\"philosophy Professor from Princeton.\\" This may cause the \\"Since I don't understand all of this, it must be good\\" syndrome to form in some readers minds. I wouldn't avoid the book (nor rate it) on this basis. Rate it for what it is: the second word in the book's title.3: `Bulls@!t is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about.

You pull it down and the book almost magically opens to the picture of a dragon that lay inscribed on a page. The remainder of the pages are blank ...except for some yellowing letters that are tucked into the back. You open them and read \\"To my dear and unfortunate successor...\\"<br /><br />What the ...?!<br /><br />You question your father about this book and the letters, and are immediately smitten with the history of ...DRACULA. Well, maybe smitten isn't the right word. Drawn in? Sucked in?<br /><br />Your father reveals startling new information about the legend of Dracula - his conquests, his effects on the political machinations in the early development of Eastern Bloc countries - and he also tells you that Vlad Tepes (i.e., Dracula) may very well still be alive. The story engulfs you, and you get pulled into the history of Dracula as if being swallowed by a black hole.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />This multi-generational story gives new blood to the legend of Dracula (pardon the pun). \\"The Historian\\", as it turns out, is Dracula himself. He loves history, has his own library, and wants someone - someone with enough knowledge about world events and history - to catalogue it for him. Enter Professor Bartholomew Rossi, the history professor of our 16-year-old narrator's father, Paul. Apparently Professor Rossi, years ago, also discovered a book with a dragon in it and was sucked into finding out the true origins of Dracula (or was/is Dracula finding out more information about him?).<br /><br />Epic is the word being touted about this book by many readers; I've heard \\"The New Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"The Historian Code\\" being used as alternate titles. Comparisons will undoubtedly be made because of their historical nature and old subject matters (Mary Magdalene for \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", and Dracula for this novel). Although I've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown, I wasn't bowled over by his book. So it was with great hesitation that I decided to pick up this one. And my hesitation was not unfounded ...<br /><br />This hefty tome of 600 plus pages (or 10 CDs if you buy the book on CD!) is \\"long in the tooth\\" (again, pardon the pun). The multi-generational story works well, but when the author frequently employs the method of \\"Oh it's late, I can't finish the story until later\\" cliche, it lost much of its momentum.<br /><br />The relationships between husband and wife, father and daughter, professor and pupil, are accurately portrayed if a bit heavy-handed. Sometimes their emotional states were a complete surprise to me; growing angry at the drop of a hat, falling in love and asking to marry someone only two weeks after meeting him/her, etc. Perhaps this first time novelist (Oh, did I forget to mention that?) felt rushed to finish the academic sections of the book and leave the understanding of the emotional entanglements for the reader to work out. The problem with doing that is that I don't CARE about the characters then. And when you do that, my dear first time author, you lose a certain amount of credibility and compassion from your readership.<br /><br />The history in \\"The Historian\\" was intriguing to say the least. Mrs. Kostova's research about the Ottoman Empire, Dutch trade, Hungarian civil strife, and a multitude of other lesser known subjects comes off well thought-out if somewhat overly drawn.<br /><br />My summation: \\"To my dear and unfortunate reader. This book  is historically interesting and colorful at the best of times, but long, over-written, and pedestrian at its worst.\\"<br /><br />(Note: Elizabeth Kostova received a two million dollar advance for this book - something unheard of in today's literary world for a first time novelist - and the film rightshave already been snatched up!)velist - and the film rights have already been snatched up!)	2005-07-08

With her on her journey comes her cousin Hedgrin, Maeywn, her brother, and Aymire, an elderly mage. They land a boat in Marfaxen, the northernmost seaport of the Angrist, and quickly set out for the lands to the south known as Taru'Anan, an evil and forbidding place full of dangerous half-elves, devious faes, and questionable men (there's even a few vampires thrown in here, too). Scena and her entourage soon encounter Khryorian, an Angrist \\"Ranger\\" who wanders the lands and reluctantly offers to guide them to Taru'Anan after he begins to fall for the lovely Scena.<br /><br />As Khryorian and his new found group of travelers move south, they encounter plenty of trouble and mixed messages from acquaintances who are supposed to be their friends, and others that are supposed to be enemies.<br /><br />A tangle of misunderstandings leads many to believe that Scena and her gathering are going to release an ancient and angry God onto the Angrist, a God who has been locked behind \\"The Forbidden Door\\" for many millennia. A race by friends and foes alike soon ensues, trying to catch up to Scena and her clan and stop them from opening \\"The Forbidden Door.\\" But is there really a terrible God behind this door? Or have myths and the truth been mixed beyond coherency? And what of the love that begins to blossom between Khryorian and Scena? Can two people, coming from two different backgrounds and with opposite understandings of their lands, really make a go of it?<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />When I first started reading this book, I actually got a little excited. I've read a lot of fantasy stories and I enjoy them. They're a great way to have your mind take a little reality break from the workaday world. And \\"That Which is Sown\\" seemed to have some decent writing ...in the beginning.<br /><br />The Good: The characters in this story are pretty good. There's a mixture of good and bad (often times within the same individual), so that made for some fairly complex situations and personalities.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good: This category is, unfortunately, going to weigh much heavier than \\"The Good\\".<br /><br />#1. The first thing that struck me was punctuation. Not a big deal usually. But it is the responsibility of the writer - before his/her book goes to print - to look over the final draft for errors and fix them. Barring that, they should hire a professional proofreader. In this novel, on almost every page, you'll see things like this: \\"I'm off.\\" He said. Note the period and then the capital \\"H\\" in \\"He\\". This not only causes English teachers to cringe but it also causes the reader to stumble. I can forgive one or two or even a dozen of these in a book, but not hundreds.<br /><br />#2. Switching perspectives. Once I got about 100 pages into the book, I found that the author loved to jump back and forth between groups of characters looking at sometimes the same scene and sometimes different things. On ONE page I found changes in perspective 10 times! Very confusing.<br /><br />#3. Copying from literature of the past. Many authors hop onto the backs of literary giants, trying to create a new concept off of old ones. No biggie. But the smacking obviousness of The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) concepts came glaring off the pages of this book. For instance: Khryorian is a \\"Ranger\\" who wanders the lands of the Angrist. Hmm. Sound a lot like Aragorn in LOTR. And Scena carries a sword called Erlindele. Does that sound a lot like the light given to Frodo? There are many, many other \\"coincidences\\" that I could comment on, but I'll stop there.<br /><br />#4. And the death sentence for this book was the lack of description of place. I had NO idea what things looked like - even \\"The Forbidden Door\\", which was supposed to be such a vital part of the story. I have no idea what the castle at Taru'Anan looks like, what the surrounding area looks like (at first I thought it was desert, but then there are trees and brush around), or what the place is supposed to feel like.<br /><br />I actually feel kind of bad giving this book two stars, as I believe that the story itself holds promise, but in its present form, it simply can't hold together as an interesting and unique read.to be such a vital part of the story.

Twenty-seven years ago, a murder took place in Declare. A young woman's body was found stabbed to death and her ten-month-old son, Nicky Jack Harjo, had been presumed dead, too. The child's pajama bottoms were found outside the house in a wooded area, the body never recovered. But following the death of Mark's parents, he found some paperwork in a safety deposit box; adoption papers. Come to find out, Mark's birth name is Nicky Jack Harjo, and he's returned to Declare to speak to his mother and find out why she'd given him up for adoption (which would be a great trick since she's dead).<br /><br />Once in Declare, Mark visits family and meets up with plenty of suspicious characters, including the town Sheriff, \\"O'Boy\\" Daniels. The case was closed by the Sheriff 27 years ago, the murder suspect being the town priest who's knife was used in the killing. And the preacher apparently killed himself before the case went to trial. Intriguing.<br /><br />Mark (aka Nicky Jack) has to dig deep into the town's past and its residents so that he can find out who his mother truly was. Some call her a tramp, a loose woman. Other say she was one of the brightest young women in town, and had a promising life ahead of her. Who's telling the truth? Is the murderer still alive ...and in town!<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />Billie Letts, award winning author of \\"Where the Heart Is\\", gets us back into the feel and flow of Oklahoma life in this wonderful novel. The prose of the story is a bit meandering, but so is life in Oklahoma, so the pacing of the novel (interestingly) matches it VERY well. Plotting is king in the story, too, as you try to guess who murdered Mark's mother and if the killer is still around.<br /><br />I listened to this story in audiobook format, and it was narrated by actor Lou Diamond Phillips. I don't much care for Mr. Phillips in the acting department (except for his excellent portrayal of Ritchie Valens in \\"La Bamba\\", 1987), but here I have to admit I was impressed with him.

And Harry's old partner, Kiz Rider, is joining him.<br /><br />You would figure that since Harry's been retired for a few years, they'd ease him into his new role/job. But no.

That's Not For Everyone	Looking over review after review of this book, I found two camps... and I wasn't the least bit surprised by their distances. First there are those that praise the book for being a literary milestone, an achievement of grand scope and memorable characters. The second group sees the book as wasted paper, a book with no redeeming qualities or characters, and no solid or memorable message.<br /><br />I'm in the former category, but for an entirely different reason. First let me say that this book (which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981) is NOT for everyone. If you enjoy upbeat, easily readable material with a smattering of bathroom humor, you'll need to look elsewhere. But if you like comedy that goes deep into character follies and Shakespearean-style astuteness, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />The main character is one of the most memorable I've ever read, which is probably why it got the Pulitzer. Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, over-educated, underachieving loser who, late into his adulthood, still lives with his alcoholic mother in the colorful city of New Orleans. Every life that Ignatius touches - or even gets near - spirals out of control. He lies, he won't work (until forced to by his mother after she crashes her car and the threat of foreclosure on their home becomes evident), and has no real friends. A loner, a loser, a person bound for obscurity.<br /><br />But little does Ignatius know that his depressing life will lead all those around him into a brighter place (even maybe himself). Even though Ignatius' \\"world view\\" and his \\"stomach valve\\" try to thwart any attempt at joining a \\"normal\\" facet of society, his errors and misdeeds will eventually lead \\"Fortuna\\" into a positive cycle. This is the message that John Kennedy Toole (the author) was trying to get across to us (for those who missed it). This is also my reason for enjoying the book so very much. The message is imbedded in the story so deeply, so inanely, that you have to take the story as a whole to enjoy it, not just its pieces. That and the fact that Mr. Toole gave us one of the most irritatingly worthless characters, added to the enjoyment of the overall narrative. Even now, I can't get Ignatius out of my head! I absolutely despise him! But then, I was supposed to.

Who brought all of their supplies over for that momentous day? Some of the soldiers and their supplies were brought over by military transports, but much, much more made its way across the Atlantic in Liberty Ships: merchant vessels that navigated the treacherous wartime waters in ships that would later be called \\"Kaiser Coffins\\" (because of how often they were sunk by enemy attacks...and how easy they WERE to sink.)<br /><br />And who were the men that grabbed the helms of these tin-cans, risking life and limb time and again? They were (are) known as The Merchant Marines. Never officially inducted into the military, many men in The Merchant Marine failed the basic physical exams given by the Armed Services. Their only hope to help fight and win the war was The Merchant Marines. And they streamed in by the thousands, volunteering to help bring needed supplies over to Europe, Australia, the Pacific Theater, and places beyond.<br /><br />It wasn't just WW II in which we find the heroic deeds of The Merchant Mariner either. Oh no. When George Washington and his army were fighting the Brits, who helped transport his legions of men? Yep. The Merchant Marine. From the U.S.'s founding fathers, to the Persian Gulf War, The Merchant Marine has been there, hauling our sons, daughters, and their needed supplies across deadly seas. And they've died in numbers larger than any of those in the Armed Services.<br /><br />So one would think that The Merchant Marine deserved a little recognition, maybe a GI Bill style package to help out those returning from wartime service, right? Especially if they were wounded during the course of the war, right? Wrong. Since The Merchant Mariner is not an \\"official\\" member of the Armed Forces, they get none of that. No GI Bill. No war memorial. No medical benefits coming anywhere near those given to veterans. Where did America go wrong? Why were these men (and women) swept under the rug of our society?<br /><br />The answers are in this book, The Forgotten Heroes by Brian Herbert.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />The book basically follows the history of Dean Beaumont, the son of Arthur Beaumont, the unofficial \\"Artist Laureate\\" of the U.S. Navy (many of Arthur Beaumont's paintings are hung in places such as The White House, the first nuclear submarine, and in private collections...often valued at over $100,000.) Dean is an asthmatic and he fails the Armed Forces medical exam, but he doesn't give up. He joins The Merchant Marines and travels the war-torn seas during WW II. And when he returns to the States, wounded and much more savvy in the ways of the world, he finds that The Merchant Marine is a disgrace. They don't qualify for anything, nothing at all.<br /><br />Although Mr. Herbert tells a story that needed to be told, his methods became a bit preachy and repetitive at times but, even so, that still didn't detract from the overall history lesson the author gives us. I'm sure most Americans had no idea of this bloody smear on our past that never made it into \\"High School History 101\\".<br /><br />This is a great book for those who wish to learn a greater depth of maritime history, and for those who'd like to remember The Forgotten Heroes.g of our society?  <br /> <br />The answers are in this book, The Forgotten Heroes by Brian Herbert.  <br /> <br />****************************************************************************** <br /> <br />The book basically follows the history of Dean Beaumont, the son of Arthur Beaumont, the unofficial \\"Artist Laureate\\" of the U.S. Navy (many of Arthur Beaumont's paintings are hung in places such as The White House, the first nuclear submarine, and in private collections...often valued at over $100,000.)

He masterfully weaves a tapestry of plot, character, and location throughout nearly every page (Example from the prologue: `She drives home the knife. The moment, she knows from past experience, is a very intimate one. Her hand is gripped around the knife's cool handle and the thrust takes the blade into the throat up to the hilt until her hand meets the throat itself. Flesh upon flesh. Jacket first, or woollen jersey, cotton shirt or T-shirt, then flesh. Now rent. The knife is writhing, like an animal sniffing. Warm blood covering hilt and hand. (The other hand covers the mouth, stifling screams.) The moment is complete. A meeting. Touching. The body hot, gaping, warm with blood. Seething inside, as insides become outsides. Boiling. The moment is coming to an end all too soon.')<br /><br />But this time we're no longer in Edinburgh. No? No. Inspector Rebus is sent to London (Oh the pain!) to try and help catch a serial killer whom the local coppers can't pin down. They've nick-named the murderer \\"The Wolfman\\", because he bites the victims on the stomach after he kills them. But why send Rebus? Well, in Knots and Crosses, he helped find another serial killer in Edinburgh, and so George Flight (a local London CID guy) requested Scotland's \\"expert\\". Rebus sees himself as anything BUT an expert on such things, but reluctantly goes to England's capital to do what he can.<br /><br />Come to find out, he can do quite a bit; including getting into lots of trouble. He falls for a beautiful psychologist named Liza Frazer (who might have connections with the killer!), disappears for hours or days on end, drinks like a fish, and goes on television and announces that they've caught the killer (even when he knows they haven't). But Rebus' mind works a bit differently than most folks. He can worm his way into a killer's mind as the case unfolds. And we again see how Rebus' past comes to the forefront and aids him in capturing the villain.<br /><br />The great thing about Rebus is that he's so f#$%ed up that the reader can identify with all of his vices and character flaws. He's no superhuman, and he knows it. But what he does have is a nose for killers, and this bodes poorly for them. Because once Rebus is on your trail, you'll never get away.<br /><br />Now, it's on to the next in the series!e killer (even when he knows they haven't).

Don't believe me? Listen to David Sedaris' Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim (audiobook) and you'll feel much, much better. Mr. Sedaris openly airs his family's dirty laundry, and does so with biting examples . . . mixed with a healthy helping of humor.<br /><br />This collection of nonfiction short stories starts out with \\"Us and Them\\", which focuses on David's early years growing up next door to a family that didn't own a television. \\"How weird are these people? I mean, where did they get their information from!\\" David exclaims.<br /><br />The narrative short stories go on and on, always about himself, his family, his friends/lovers, and always poignant, funny, or both.<br /><br />My favorite story was \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\", which recounts the history of Saint Nicholas as told in the Netherlands. Did you know that Santa doesn't have elves there? I didn't! Instead, for the past few centuries, he's had six to eight black men helping him out, \\"Which is kind of weird that it's six to eight, considering they've had plenty of time to nail down the exact number.\\" And Santa, according to them, doesn't live at the North Pole. Oh no. He lives in Spain and, if you're bad, is more likely to kick and beat you (or at least pretend to).<br /><br />Although David Sedaris takes swings at his own family and other countries, he's also apt to focus on himself and his native U.S.<br /><br />It is interesting to find out (again, in \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\") that the blind can legally hunt in Michigan and Texas. \\"And, while in Texas it's mandatory for the blind to have a guide, in Michigan they can go it alone. Which begs the question: if they actually kill something, how do they find it after they've shot it?\\"<br /><br />As for himself, Mr. Sedaris isn't afraid to show the reader his own compulsive disorder. He loves to touch people's heads, just as shoppers enjoy stroking suede or some other nice cloth. And with this comes the worry that the general population might find this offensive, especially coming from an openly gay man. This comes into terrible focus when the author helps a twelve-year-old boy carry hot coffee containers up to his room at a hotel, and really, really wants to touch his head.<br /><br />Like Garrison Keillor and his Prairie Home Companion, David Sedaris deserves a place on your bookshelves (or in your car on audiobook). But be warned, while Mr. Keillor's format is more family oriented, Mr. Sedaris holds back nothing - language included.

Ouch! Ugh! Grrr! I recently finished reading some horrifically bad novels by a few American authors and then (happily) stumbled upon this weird guy's books, known collectively as the Inspector Rebus series. Ian Rankin, a Scottish writer, is the creator of this series . . . and I'm REALLY glad I found him!<br /><br />Like a jigsaw puzzle, Mr. Rankin overlaps every vital piece of information into the vibrant plot, from the military and Rebus' family, to excessive smoking and drinking. Add to this fact that the author makes me feel right at home in a country (Scotland) I've never visited, and you've got me hooked.<br /><br />The story revolves around the life of Detective John Rebus, a hard-living, fast-drinking, oft-womanizing cop whom the author ultimately makes you care about. Rebus has plenty of problems, too: he's divorced, has a young daughter approaching teenhood, has terrible nightmares about his time in the British special forces (SAS), and wants desperately to be left alone. But a murderer is on the loose, and our flawed detective has to work the case . . . and he is soon drawn into the killer's web of murder. The brutality of Edinburgh (showing an underbelly that most tourists never see, nor want to hear about) comes slithering off the pages. (Example from Chapter 1: \\"The girl screamed once, only the once. Even that, however, was a minor slip on his part. That might have been the end of everything, almost before it had begun. Neighbours inquisitive, the police called in to investigate. No, that would not do at all. Next time he would tie the gag a little tighter, just a little tighter, just that little bit more secure.\\").<br /><br />Detective John Rebus was introduced to the world in this first novel back in 1987, and Mr. Rankin hasn't let up over the intervening years. The London Times and other British periodicals have lavished him with stunning reviews ever since, but the true test is whether or not his books can withstand rigorous readings from those of us on the other side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />Ian Rankin's Detective Rebus, I'm happy to say, has found a comfy home on my shelves (and many others from what I've read online and in the papers). Kirkus, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and many others, have given this book - and the remainder of his series - a very appropriate welcome into the States. An added bonus, too, is that Rebus, an appropriately dark (in tone) television series, was shot on location in Edinburgh, produced by the BBC, and can be seen from time to time on cable station BBC America.<br /><br />Although this is only the first of the seventeen Rebus novels, I intend to read them all. In fact, I've already started on my next dose of Rebus. Congratulations, Mr. Rankin. You've found yourself another reader of your excellent novels.or not his books can withstand rigorous readings from those of us on the other side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br />Ian Rankin's Detective Rebus, I'm happy to say, has found a comfy home on my shelves (and many others from what I've read online and in the papers).

He's got a job with the Humane Society as an animal control officer, ticketing those that abuse or neglect their animals; he's got a small apartment in DC that he shares with Jasmine, a mutt he saved; and he's trying to get back into his daughter's life, whom he hasn't been able to speak with since returning from his eight year stint in prison on drug-related charges.<br /><br />Rachel Lopez is Lorenzo's probation officer who has problems of her own. She drinks too much, is sexually stunted because of her upbringing, and needs almost as much help as the people she's trying to keep from going back behind bars.<br /><br />Rachel and Lorenzo's lives are about to be changed forever. A violent act by a brash young man ends up changing everything. Is death and destruction all that lie ahead for our two characters? Can an ex-con truly ever be a successful member of society without falling back into old habits?<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />There were several problems with this novel that made it a poor read for me. First, and most prominently, was the author's prose. Mr. Pelecanos, I've noted, is a screenwriter and this may be a pretty big issue. Screenplays and novels are two entirely different styles of writing, and this book didn't read like a novel; it read like a screenplay. Here's an example of this [...]prose (this scene is during a fairly pivotal moment in which an illegal dog fighting ring has been found and is about to be busted up): `The dogs were released. They ran to the center of the ring and clashed. The crowd was loud and intense. They laughed and called out for murder and blood. The dogs were virtually silent. [...]<br /><br />The second problem was execution. Nothing of remote interest happens in the book before page 150. For a 304 page book, that's a disaster for a reader like me. I've read books where not a lot happens by the halfway point in the book - and I've enjoyed some of them - but these were carefully woven stories with interesting characters and prose that kept me engaged. I didn't find that in Drama City.<br /><br />Thirdly was the language and word choice[...]. Lorenzo is a pretty tough dude living in a distinctly tough neighborhood. Life is gritty, sometimes fleeting, and always a battle. So why would words like \\"feces\\" and \\"excrement\\" and \\"urination\\" appear in such a world instead of their much more colorful descriptors that can't be uttered on daytime TV? [The book] DOES use those more colorful terms . . . sometimes. But the way he mixed up the words felt completely unnatural and forced.<br /><br />Fourth and final was the editing of the book. Example: `He went were he wasn't supposed to go.' Several times I noted \\"were\\" instead of \\"where\\". And there were other problems, too, but that one stood out above the rest.<br /><br />If this is a sampling of Mr. Pelecanos' writing, I fear I won't be reading anything else by him.- and I've enjoyed some of them - but these were carefully woven stories with interesting characters and prose that kept me engaged.

This was Andrew Vachss' first Burke series crime novel, and it is something of a gem. The book is now in its bazillionth reprint and you can usually find it on your bookstore shelves (or in the local library) even though its initial publication was back in 1985. 20 years! Many books fall off the face of the Earth after 20 years, but this is one of those that's persevered.<br /><br />So who is this Burke guy? Well, he's a tough little S.O. B. who knows the streets of New York and utilizes them to his advantage. He's not above taking on a job that results in the death of a scumbag (no trial needed here), nor does he have any qualms about not paying any bills (like rent or telephone. He \\"borrows\\" his neighbor's phone without their knowledge). He lives in a small office space with his pet dog, Pansy. A loveable but ultimately frightening creature who guards Burke's possessions.<br /><br />One day, a woman contacts Burke and asks to meet with him. Her name is Flood and she has a problem: a friend of hers was killed by someone named \\"The Cobra\\" and she wants revenge. She's been training in Japan under the tutelage of a master Karate instructor in preparation for the day she meets The Cobra, too.<br /><br />Burke has to pool all of his resources in order to find out about The Cobra. I mean, he wouldn't mind getting rid of a true slime, but he wants to be sure that he's on the right side. So Burke deploys his \\"team\\" of New York misfits, hoping to find out more about The Cobra. Among this gathering are Burke's long time friend (and adopted brother), Max the Silent. He's a martial arts expert with the grace of Gene Kelley and the powerhouse body of Arnold Schwarzenegger during his Mr. Universe days. Then there's Michelle, the beautiful prostitute with a heart of gold and the plumbing of a man! She's Burkes' ears on the street. The Mole is Burkes' geek-in-residence who lives in a junkyard and has the IQ of Albert Einstein. He's the man you call when you need anything mechanical or electronic manipulated . . . or blown up.<br /><br />Burke also uses some pull that he has with various political figures within the city and with someone named The Prophet, a man who lives on the streets of New York City but has the pulse of the Big Apple wrapped inside himself. An amazing character.<br /><br />With the help of his \\"team\\", Burke finds The Cobra, and the final scene between Flood and her enemy comes to a head. Who will win? Can revenges' thirst be quenched so easily?<br /><br />What drew me into this story was the author's abilities. His narrative prose bulldozed by without ever slowing down. I was amazed to see that, during my first sitting with the book, I'd read over 50 pages. That's how fast this book reads. Also, the characters are so memorable that you never have to look back and see who is who. You KNOW these people. They're flawed and terrible and great and bad.<br /><br />I also found it interesting that Mr. Vacchs incorporated a lot of the sexual underworld in the book. Pornography, child abuse, prostitution, all make their ugly appearances but without smacking the reader in the face with their obvious unpleasantness.<br /><br />The fact that this book was entitled FLOOD also made me smile.

She has only one good friend at the east coast university where she teaches (a gay educator who injects some much needed humor into the story), lives a solitary life in a dorm-style setting, and has recently fallen in love with Samuel Blake, the new art history teacher at the school. But Kate's past can't stay hidden any longer. Samuel stumbles (literally) upon her darkest secret when he asks Kate to attend one of his classes, and he begins discussing the case of child pornography that surrounded the photographing of two young girls by a famous artist in the 1960's and 70's. Come to find out, Kate was one of those girls . . . and her name isn't Kate at all.<br /><br />Myla Wolfe (Kate's real name) must return to Portland, Oregon and face her worst fears: what had happened to her sister, Prudence (then thirteen). We learn early on in the novel that Pru somehow died, but the author-Miranda Whitemore-eases us into Myla's life, and the nightmare surrounding the horrific day in which she lost her young sibling.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />What drew me into this story was the authors lyrical prose. On almost every page Mrs. Whitemore can pull you into the emotions that her characters feel; not an easy thing to do. At times, I felt as though I were reading one very long poetic verse told against the backdrop of these peoples' lives. So I'd give this first time novelist an \\"A+\\" for style. Beautiful.<br /><br />Where I had difficulty was with the overly-long story line and minimal payoff at the end. Now some readers might enjoy the emotional heartstrings that the author plucks away at (and, quite honestly, I didn't mind it all that much either), but I think the \\"wait for it...here it comes...wait... it's still coming....here it comes...wait a little longer\\" style of writing grew a bit wearisome. She developed the characters nicely, so dragging us along on every single road-trip that Myla/Kate takes was unnecessary.<br /><br />There's also a critical piece missing at the end of story that I'm sure the author struggled with; that being the whereabouts of the famous photographer who took the nude images of Myla and Prudence. She left it open, not letting us know either way what had truly happened to her. That kind of left me wanting. I don't expect EVERYTHING to be spelled out for me, but this was a pretty pivotal character in the story, so tying up that loose end would've been nice. Now I'm left guessing: \\"Did she kill herself in a funk of depression?\\" \\"Is she alive somewhere, doing some other form of art? Painting perhaps?\\" \\"Maybe she's in an asylum somewhere.\\"<br /><br />But even with these issues, the story is told in such an artistic style that I'd seriously recommend this book to those authors who have trouble with their descriptions of characters emotions. I'd tell them, \\"See! This is how you do it!\\"ers nicely, so dragging us along on every single road-trip that Myla/Kate takes was unnecessary.  <br /> <br />There's also a critical piece missing at the end of story that I'm sure the author struggled with; that being the whereabouts of the famous photographer who took the nude images of Myla and Prudence.

Yes, Punctuation	I recently had the honor of editing a portion of a book and found myself wanting for a resource on punctuation. I already had Strunk and White: The Elements of Style, but its lessons are decades old (but still relevant on some levels).<br /><br />To my amazement, one day I opened up my local paper and found Eats, Shoots & Leaves on the national nonfiction best-seller list. A book on punctuation? A best-seller? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's true (Quick! Find a seat if you're feeling faint!).<br /><br />So why is this book an international success?<br /><br />I like to think it's because some readers, writers, editors, and publishers have grown weary of seeing error after error show up in popular literature, billboard signs, grocery store windows, and on homework assignments (I threw that in just for you teachers out there). Ms. Truss calls herself a punctuation stickler; but I don't see it that way. She's simply trying to \\"write\\" (ha-ha)  the wrongs out there! And she's found an effective tool in her new book.<br /><br />Most books on punctuation are bland, barely readable tomes that many-an-author keeps on his/her shelves as a resource guide; flipping to it only when they need a refresher on certain rules (I certainly do this with Strunk and White. Don't you?). But Eats, Shoots & Leaves takes that resource a lot further. Here Lynne Truss moves us into our literary past, showing us when, where, and why such things as the semicolon and the question mark came into use-a fascinating historical recounting you won't find in those \\"other\\" punctuation guides. This book also differs in that the author utilizes some mildly entertaining humor (much of which-unfortunately- will be lost on those who don't know a lot about punctuation to begin with, or are unfamiliar with many British-isms) that keeps the book light and enjoyable without sinking us into the \\"hard and fast rules\\" of punctuation, making it sound like we're being preached to by our eighth grade English teacher.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Ms. Truss' (sorry, but I'm not adding an \\"s\\" onto the end of her name) ability to give us the various rules, the history behind them, the rationale for their use, and then tell us that, sometimes, there is no right or wrong way; just differences of opinion. She also shows us how these \\"opinions\\" can cause a serious rift between author and editor, even at the prestigious New York Times and London Times.<br /><br />A fun read, and not just for the sticklers among us.

Without Exception	There are few books out there that can make you think, laugh, and cringe at the same time. This is one of them.<br /><br />First, let me say that I do watch The Daily Show on the Comedy Channel. It's witty, informative, and sometimes vile. I love it. In a time where the news media takes itself too seriously, or acts more like an entertainment venue than a forum for public information, The Daily Show is a breath of fresh air. So I was eager to pick up a copy of \\"America\\" and read.<br /><br />There may be some worries on the part of Republicans (based on The Daily Show's left leaning style of reporting) that this book might be a bashing of their political base. It isn't. The bashing is spewed across an incredibly large landscape (yes, Republicans are in there, but so are the Democrats, the Independents, the Jews, the Supreme Court, publishers, radio and television, science, religion, and . . . oh God, there's just tons of potshots taken on every single page).<br /><br />\\"America The Book\\" is about democracy, from its founding to the mess we currently find ourselves in---and there's even a look into what our future might hold: \\"Genetically `enhanced' children will talk at a younger age, be born toilet-trained and never get sick. They will also lack the capacity to love.\\"<br /><br />But we start out with Greece in the fifth century BC and travel a bumpy road full of aching democracies, until we reach the United States. Once in the mighty U.S., we begin to see our nation take flight (or at least glide a few feet before bouncing off the ground).<br /><br />The thing that amazed me about the book is that it actually IS a textbook of sorts. A twisted textbook, but a textbook nonetheless. If you don't like reading a merry chorus of \\"F-yous\\" and the like---once in a while---be forewarned, they are in here. But if you don't mind that sort of language, and enjoy laughing and learning, you should pick up a copy.<br /><br />The fact that you can flip to any page in this book and learn something about our great nation while tears of mirth drip down your cheeks is something not to be taken lightly.<br /><br />Don't believe me?<br /><br />Let's take a little test. I'm going to open the book to a random page right now. There! Let me see here . . . um . . . okay, here we go. Page 49. Quoting the President: On Honesty. \\"Martha, when I tell you I was helping Ms. Hemings move her bed against the wall, I mean precisely that.\\" -Thomas Jefferson, August 20, 1785.<br /><br />Now it might help to know a little bit of history, and if you do I'm sure you're chuckling at this made-up quote. But it's also incredibly informative in its own way. Ms. Hemings was a slave, and Thom Jefferson a slave owner who may have fathered children by her. Although this book makes light of the subject, it's also an effective way to learn (those that don't know about Ms. Hemings might be inclined to look her up on the internet after reading something like that. I wish THIS had been part of my reading assignments when I was in high school or college!).<br /><br />That I could go on and on about how wonderful this book is shows its powerful and thought-provoking messages.<br /><br />(Note: This book was released in September 2004 and remains on many best-seller lists.

This is the first time I've read anything by Ian Rankin, and based on this book I'd rate him right up there with my three other favorite British mystery writers: P.D. James, Elizabeth George, and, of course, Agatha Christie.<br /><br />And I needed a new mystery writer! Agatha hasn't written anything for quite some time (could be because she's dead), P.D. James hasn't had anything new (is she still writing?), and Elizabeth George is still working but I just couldn't wait any longer for her next book.<br /><br />So it was with a great deal of pleasure that I was given an advanced reading copy of Fleshmarket Alley to review.<br /><br />Why do I find British mystery writers so much better than their American counterparts? I know that a lot of people will take umbrage with this comment, but I always enjoy the British authors' writing styles compared to those in the States (if you agree with this sentiment, I have no doubt you'll enjoy this novel).<br /><br />I found the story's complexity, depth, and length (a comfortable 420 pages) a very satisfying read. I don't know much about detective Rebus, but this book makes me want to read all of Mr. Rankin's earlier novels based on this character (starting with Knots and Crosses). This is my favorite type of murder mystery; it's not important who did the dastardly deed, it's the road to discovery as to why the murder(s) took place that make it a rich reading experience.<br /><br />I also found this novel especially intriguing because of the political and sociological atmosphere (in Scotland) that surrounds the action and investigation-which gives you a lot to ponder, besides just the murders. I learned a great deal about the Scottish immigration and refugee problem, which made me more aware of issues outside of my own little world; it left me thinking about the book long after I'd finished reading. Isn't that what reading is all about?<br /><br />I hope his other books are as satisfying as this one-I plan to read more about detective Rebus. My only complaint is that I wish they'd included a glossary of British/Scottish slang terms. I was a little lost when phrases like \\"no cheap plonk\\" and others suddenly appeared. I was able to figure it out in context, but for the average American reader, I'm sure a glossary would be much appreciated. Even so, it added to the flavor of this author's British roots and his style of writing.<br /><br />Getting back to my earlier comment about British mystery writers over American mystery writers, the British authors don't seem to dumb-down their writing to appeal to the masses, while their American counterparts (you know . . . those \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", etc. murder mysteries) tend to be formulaic and repetitious after the third or fourth (or tenth!) book.<br /><br />If you want a satisfying read and you've run out of British authors (like I have), try discovering Ian Rankin. You won't be disappointed.ead more about detective Rebus. My only complaint is that I wish they'd included a glossary of British/Scottish slang terms.

From its humble beginnings as a Spanish fort (1770-1822), to the Mexican occupation (1822-1846), and into the United States (1846 to present day), this little spit of land has seen a lot of activity - and a bit of fame.<br /><br />James Doolittle (of the Doolittle raiders) was on-hand at The Presidio in April of 1988 during a WW II commemoration ceremony. And with him came Brig. General James (Jimmy) Stewart (you know him, right?).<br /><br />If you've ever wondered how certain roads in and around The Presidio got their names (Giggling, Bolio, etc.), you'll get some keen insights about where they came from. If you've ever wanted to know what The Presidio looked like before 1950, this book will show you some great images; including soldiers in full dress.<br /><br />My only beef with the book was that I felt it was a bit too heavy in pictures and didn't have enough historical information. I know, I know. The title of the book is \\"Images of America\\". But still, I would've liked a tiny bit more detail about the area to round out the flavor of the times.<br /><br />But great images. You'd be hard-pressed to find another book out there with the picture quality of this one.	2005-01-30

It appears to be a meteorite of some kind, and his family - not being the wealthiest in the lands by any means - might be able to sell it. So Eragon picks it up and carries it back home. But no one back home seems to want it.<br /><br />Then one night in Eragon's room, the little \\"rock\\" begins making strange noises. It turns out this wasn't a rock at all. But instead was a dragon's egg! One of the last eggs in all of Alagaesia. And the dragon inside (eventually named Saphira) has chosen Eragon as its rider; an ancient and noble distinction.<br /><br />Evil tidings are ahead for Eragon and Saphira, as the king of Alagaesia, Galbatorix, sends his minions to capture our heroes and bring them back to his castle. And these minions are horrible creatures: venomous Ra'zacs and wicked Urgals who will do anything to capture them. Eragon is forced to flee after a deadly attack on his home which ends up killing several people. But before he leaves, Brom, an old storyteller from his hometown, comes with him (this wise old-timer turns out to be much more than a simple wordsmith, too).<br /><br />Great and terrible deeds await Eragon on his journey. He must grapple with his own coming of age, his growing powers as a dragonrider, and deal with love and loss on multiple levels.<br /><br />What makes this story engrossing is Christopher Paolini's world. He's created a magical place with believable characters and interesting names. The fact that Eragon and his dragon can only communicate via telepathy is an interesting twist on an old theme (i.e., dragon/human relationships).<br /><br />Where the novel falls short is in originality. If you've read Lord of the Rings or The Dragon Riders of Pern, you'll be all too familiar with the storyline and its archetypal characters. The journey is pretty standard fare, too, but this young author has shown amazing promise for a first time novelist.<br /><br />Many readers have lambasted the author for following (or even plagiarizing) those fantasy giants who've come before him (J.R.R. Tolkien to be blunt). But many have followed in the footsteps of these giants. Indeed, most fantasy novels that came after master Tolkien's magnum opus dragged parts of the Lord of the Rings in with them. It's not plagiarism; it's reinventing the magic that these stories gave us and putting it into a new context. Oh sure, they don't break any new ground, but they weren't meant to, and I believe that Chris Paolini has done a fine job of pulling in many facets of previously done themes and putting a new character into their midst. Congratulations for that.<br /><br />What also drew me to this book was that when Chris Paolini first started writing this he was fifteen years old (the same age as Eragon, the hero of the story). Also was the fact that the author self-published it first, then got picked up by a large publishing house and soon after sold the movie rights for an undisclosed sum. Not bad, Chris.

Reading these stories is like putting your brain on autopilot. They're not deep, thoughtful, and heavy-laden pieces of fiction. They're fun, light, and just a downright joy to read.<br /><br />Like ONE FOR THE MONEY (the first in the series), TWO FOR THE DOUGH is told in first person by a hard-edged---if somewhat desperate---bounty hunter named Stephanie Plum. She's been forced into the job in order to keep eating. But unlike the first book, this one shows us that Steph is becoming a bit more adept at her new profession. Now she's chasing after Joe Mancuso, a murderer, and the tension (and comedy) get moved up a notch.<br /><br />We still have all the original characters from the first novel. Steph's parents, cousin Vinnie and his office staff, Rex the hamster, Grandma Mazur, and, of course, Officer Joe Morelli. I saved the best for last. Grandma Mazur is much more prevalent in this story and a truly engaging character (someone you WILL sympathize with as you read on). And then we have Joe Morelli, Steph's love interest and 'partner' who both uses and lusts after her. Will they get together? Time will tell.<br /><br />I didn't give this story (or its predecessor) five stars simply because they're just not five star material. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Like I said in the beginning of this review, they're light reading that allows you to whiz through the story and enjoy its soft touches. Will I be reading the next in the series? You can bet on it.	2004-12-20
US	49883642	R1BTE1B57U5MC6	0802713432	654799136	Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love	Books	3	2	7	N	N	Misdirected Title; Standard Fare Book	Most of us know the history of Galileo; the tumult surrounding his accusation of heresy when he claimed the Earth revolved around the Sun (a Copernican view). But few know about his family life. He had two illegitimate daughters, and one of them - Maria Celeste - became the apple of her father's eye. She was intelligent, well-spoken, a good God-fearing catholic. She was also a nun in a convent and it was this that drove Galileo's Daughter, the book by Dava Sobel.<br /><br />Irony is at its best here. While the catholic superpower of the 17th century swings its mighty weight around, Galileo begins challenging many of the church's long-held beliefs (that the Earth is NOT the center of the universe!). Meanwhile, his daughters are ushered into God's holy order of nuns, yet support their father from behind the walls of their convent. Most outspoken among them is Maria Celeste, his eldest. She broods over her father and aids him in any way she can (including writing letters to high-power officials affiliated with Mother Church).<br /><br />The most striking thing about the history surrounding Galileo, is how involved the church was in every aspect of everyone's lives. Science and religion went hand-in-hand back then; a bad idea.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because whenever a scientific discovery was made that in any way went against religious scripture, it was immediately censured or labeled as heretical. Just ask Galileo.<br /><br />The catholic church has a lot to atone for, in my humble opinion. One would think that some time shortly after Galileo's death the church would rescind its ban on his books and apologize for their error. But no. How long would it take before this happened? Let's see, Galileo died in 1642. In 1892, the university of Pisa awarded Galileo an honorary degree - 250 years after his death. Had the church forgiven him yet?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovers that the universe is expanding. Surely the church must've acknowledged their mistake by now!<br /><br />No way.<br /><br />Spaceflight, microwaves, computers, and a multitude of other discoveries will take place long before the church forgives Galileo his \\"sins\\". Unbelievable.<br /><br />So Galileo's Daughter was interesting from a historical perspective (thus my three star rating). But from a story perspective, it dragged and was held together only just. The letters from Maria Celeste to her father are scattered throughout the pages. And although it is interesting to hear about the spoiling of wine and the selling of produce from Galileo's land, it became rather burdensome to hear of it time and again (at least for me it became so).<br /><br />I also don't think that the title of this novel (Galileo's Daughter) is appropriate. His daughter IS in there. But not enough to warrant the title. Oh sure, the ending is excellent and ties in with the title quite well, but all the previous pages held more information on Galileo himself than his daughter - there just wasn't enough historical references available regarding his daughter to make it a novel \\"based\\" on her.church must've acknowledged their mistake by now!  <br /> <br />No way.  <br /> <br />Spaceflight, microwaves, computers, and a multitude of other discoveries will take place long before the church forgives Galileo his \\"sins\\".

Stephanie Plum's most vivid memory of anything sexual comes from her days as a child when young Joe Morelli looked up her skirt in his garage while they played train and tunnel. Then, after high school, they had a VERY brief fling on the floor of a bakery, Morelli leaving without saying a word. Stephanie wasn't happy about THAT. In fact, she was so upset that, when she spotted him later, she ran up on a curb with her car and pummeled Morelli, breaking one of his legs.<br /><br />Years later, we have Stephanie in a destitute position after losing the only job she could get as a lingerie buyer. She's hawking her furniture and kitchen utensils to help herself stay self-sufficient, away from her parents and the eccentric grandma Mazur. She's trying to find a new job, too (without much success).<br /><br />But then she's reacquainted with her cousin Vinnie, a bondsman. Stephanie is about to become a bounty hunter. Uh boy. And her first case: Joseph Morelli! Holy cr@%! Morelli, now a cop on the lamb, is accused of killing an unarmed suspect and has jumped bail. And if Stephanie Plum finds him, it's payday in the amount of $10,000! But Stephanie doesn't know anything about being a bounty hunter.<br /><br />Enter \\"Ranger\\", a bada$$ bounty hunter with years of experience. He finds Stephanie attractive and helps her out, teaching her about gun usage (which she is terrified of), and other ways of subduing suspects. Could she really shoot Morelli? She did run him over with her car that one time. Would shooting him be that different?<br /><br />Soon Stephanie re-encounters Joe Morelli and the sparks begin to fly. The passion they feel for one another is still palpable, but so is Steph's need to eat. Which will win out? You'll just have to read this fast-paced novel and find out for yourself.	2004-12-03

It won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, and the Howells Medal in 1935. Many colleges use it as required reading, \\"A true classic\\" the professors will tell you. And now the estimable Oprah Winfrey has picked it as a \\"Book Club\\" selection for 2004. The latter surprised me greatly because Ms. Winfrey tends to pick stories that have a strong female protagonist. This one, by all means, is male-driven because of the time and location it focuses on (pre-revolutionary China).<br /><br />The story starts with Wang Lung, a poor farmer, on his way to meet his bride. His needs are far removed from those of our 21st century world: he wants someone to help take care of his aging father, to bear him children, and to run the household while he tills the soil. Love doesn't enter the equation. So Wang Lung travels to the House of Hwang in his small village, and there he meets O-lan, his future wife; a slave girl in this rich house. She's not that attractive, but she appears stout and strong.<br /><br />Wang marries her and they soon fall into a routine. But bad weather is on the way. There's been no rain for two seasons and nothing is growing on the farm. They now have four children, too, and must flee the terrible heat and head to \\"the Big City.\\" Here Wang Lung and his family find the corruption of mankind (people steal to survive - even his children do this - and those with the most horde their wealth). The Wang Lung family finally return north and resettle their home again. The weather becomes more temperate, and the rains come.<br /><br />Soon, Wang Lung saves money thanks to his bountiful harvests, and he buys more and more land. The family becomes wealthy, but more trials and unrest await Wang Lung. He struggles and fails against sins of the flesh; his sons battle one another over money and posterity; soldiers invade the countryside and take what they like; O-lan takes ill and it appears nothing can save her; Wang Lung's father ages and becomes more and more forgetful; and a cycle of buying and selling the land threatens the very fabric of his family.<br /><br />It is worthy to note that this story's cadence is unlike any that modern-day readers are used to. Pearl S. Buck (the author) grew up in China thanks to her missionary parents, and it is from the Chinese language that she basically translates what happens to Wang Lung and his family. (Example from page 171: `Now there was in the town a great tea shop but newly opened and by a man from the south, who understood such business, and Wang Lung had before passed the place by, filled with horror at the thought of how money was spent there in gambling and in play and in evil women.')<br /><br />Times change, and writing styles change with them.

WICKED is, at its core, a character study of what we thought we knew about the Wicked Witch of the West - whether you've read L. Frank Baum's masterpiece, or seen the Disneyized adaption of The Wizard of Oz. This version might be tough for the die-hard film enthusiasts to digest, but rest assured there's plenty of material in here to enliven even the staunchest critic.<br /><br />What Gregory Maguire (the author) has done is to create a backstory for the Wicked Witch of the West. He also gives her a special name: Elphaba, a nod toward her creator, L. Frank Baum, as Mr. Maguire incorporated the author's name (work on it, you'll figure it out).<br /><br />There's almost too much information in the book to cover in one simple review: there's the quest for the existence of souls, the search for God (in something called the Unnamed God), a challenge to our knowledge of what true evil is (is Elphaba REALLY evil?), family and how they impact our growth (or stunt it), adultery (is it adultery if it happens in another realm?), sexual behavior, mythology within this mythological world, politics and government, sibling rivalry, fate versus individual choice, and a smattering of other ideals. Wow!<br /><br />Gregory Maguire also pushes many of these themes to their limits. For instance, he asks the reader - in no uncertain terms - does our upbringing turn us into the people we eventually become? Are humans the only sentient creatures? How does our family relate to us in our later years? Can we break away from fate and create our own path? Do political extremes drive people of power to commit terrible crimes? This last is drawn in vivid detail thanks to the Wizard of Oz. In WICKED, he's not the bumbling simpleton we see in the film; he's conniving and willing to do anything to stay in power. Anything.

Nietzsche, Darwin, and Kant's names have all been invoked here at Amazon.com, vainly trying to encapsulate TOWING JEHOVAH: a world/book that knows no god.<br /><br />So what's this TOWING JEHOVAH stuff all about?<br /><br />We have the Catholic Church, Angels (Raphael, etc.), Theologians, and a smattering of other religious people and symbols trying to battle against the sinful concept that God doesn't exist. Well what would happen if God's two mile long body was found floating at 0 degrees Latitude and 0 degrees Longitude? Who would be right? Uh-oh. A conundrum.<br /><br />What the author of TOWING JEHOVAH (James Morrow) does is show us the conflict that would ensue in light of such a discovery. The devout would like to say, \\"Ah-hah! See! God does exist. Or ...um ...he DID exist.\\" While the atheists and agnostics would be saying, \\"Ah-hah! See! God is dead! Um ...but I guess he did exist.\\"<br /><br />But now that God IS dead, what do you do? How do you prove your points about God (be you an atheist or a believer), if his corpse has been found lifelessly floating in the Atlantic? Maybe we should just sweep this under the rug ...<br /><br />And to that effect, God's angels recommend that His body be entombed in the arctic in a special cave that the angels have dug out for Him. Is this what God really wanted? Hmm. And how do we get His body up to the icy cave?<br /><br />Enter Anthony Van Horne, an able sea captain in the Merchant Marines who's had a bit of bad luck recently. A supertanker he was captaining, the Carpco Valparaiso, ran aground and spilled crude over a beautiful section of the sea. He's also got an old sea-dog father who's none too happy with the way his son has turned out. But the Carpco Valparaiso was saved and her hull repaired. She now flies the colors of the Vatican and they have a plan to get God's body to His final resting place; thus TOWING JEHOVAH.<br /><br />Once they've hooked up to God and begin towing Him, the story really starts to pick up. Believers and non-believers are at odds as to the significance of God's death, and as to WHY they're TOWING JEHOVAH to an icy grave without letting the world know of His demise (There's also a side plot involving women's rights and how the evidence of a truly male deity might destroy all the work that women have done to improve their standings in society; but this isn't what holds the book together).<br /><br />Getting God's body to His grave becomes the challenge of a lifetime for Anthony Van Horne. He has to battle his own past, atheists who want the body destroyed because it shows the truth of God's existence (even though He's dead now), the Catholic Church who want to keep this all hush-hush (\\"What would happen if people found out that God had died? Would they have any sort of moral compass to guide them?\\"), and an island of Pagan symbolism that sprouts from the sea like an angry mound of cr@p!<br /><br />Against all odds, and opposition from both sides of the religious theocratic discussion, Captain Van Horne delivers his \\"cargo\\" to its destination.<br /><br />The comedy in TOWING JEHOVAH isn't a `slap your leg and laugh-out-loud' style. It's subtle and satirical and biting and the type that will invite discussions on what James Morrow has dropped in our laps. Some have gone so far as to call this author \\"the Salmon Rushdie of Christianity.\\" Maybe. But his jabs at both sides of the spiritual issues are what draw you into this book, not its pretext that God is dead. Because, let's face it, for those that truly believe in God, how COULD He die?<br /><br />Also, if you're looking for a \\"final answer\\" to the question of God's existence or what we should do if He is ever discovered (dead or alive), you won't find it in these pages. Mr. Morrow sets up the pins, but he purposely doesn't knock them down. I mean, come on! He's not stupid!towing Him, the story really starts to pick up.

And a worthy one. Geared toward the fifth to ninth grade reader, it has a cadence and beauty that will not be lost on those who choose to read it, even those of us who might be a bit older, too (like me!). I usually don't comment on the cover art of a book (\\"you can't judge a book by its cover\\"), but I think it is noteworthy to mention that the eye-catching design has insightful meaning to the story (the sandy beach, a girl's legs running on that beach, the colorful purple dress, the tattoo running up her legs, and, of utmost importance, the Sun and Moon pendant that is a significant symbol within the narrative).<br /><br />The story unfolds around the life of Path, a young girl who is leaving her country home of Boon to live as a Hand (that's a weaver's apprentice) at a stodgy old ladies loomhouse. Bringing with her from Boon, she carries a special pendant - the Sun and Moon - that she took from her mother just before she died.<br /><br />Once in her new community she is swiftly snatched up by Heron, her grumpy new loomhouse boss, and befriended by Bird, a nice young boy who works in the bakery next door. Excitement is palpable as everyone in this little village prepares for the Midsummer's Day celebration; everything (and I do mean everything) is packed into a burning pyre in the Circle of town, indicating the ending of the old year and beginning of the new.<br /><br />But Path isn't very hip about Midsummer's Day. It's where her mother left her and turned her over to her father many years ago. Path has never forgiven her mother for that - the abandonment she feels throughout the story is achingly present - and hasn't attended a Midsummer's Day celebration in years because of it. Can she release the Moon and Star pendant, throwing it into the fire to live anew? Or will the fire envelope her instead?<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book is that it can be enjoyed on many different levels. In order, there is: a coming of age story, a futuristic society turned back to a bartering civilization, a science fiction element in the development of trees that absorb and produce everything from batteries to earthen items, a love story, and unusual family dynamics. Although this may sound like something that would confuse younger readers, on the contrary I believe it will stimulate their imaginations. And even if they don't catch all the nuances to other themes, they're sure to enjoy at least a few levels of understanding after they're done with the novel.n many different levels.

Mainly because I actually liked the way the author (Mr. Klein) writes. His prose is flowing, frightening, and fun all at the same time. The characters are vivid (even secondary characters like roommates) and get lodged in your psyche long after you've put the book down, too.<br /><br />But let's talk about the story for a moment.<br /><br />The plot circles around a creature that has long lay dormant in the Earth. Every so often - at special times of a special year - it can grow in strength. During one of these `strengthenings' it captures a young boy and plants within him the evils that it harbors for mankind. This boy, now grown to a very old but powerful man named Rosie, has received a message from his underworld master that the world is about to change; and the creature is about to come out of the Earth and reek havoc on humanity (because of the disrespect humans have shown toward the environment).<br /><br />Enter Jeremy Freirs, a nobody-of-a-professor, who happens to fall for Carol, a beautiful virginal woman who tried to be a catholic nun (but failed) and is now a librarian in New York City. Little does Jeremy know that Carol's untouched virtue will play a pivotal role in The Ceremonies that are being set up by Rosie, the master's above ground puppet.<br /><br />Jeremy decides to leave New York City for the summer and spend some time in the country. He moves in with a couple (Sarr and Deborah Poroth) who are VERY religiously inclined and live in an Amish-like settlement with similarly minded folks. Jeremy thinks he'll be able to get some reading and research done for next year's classes, but little does he know that the cycles of The Ceremonies are in the Poroth's backyard. A horrifying and engrossing set of circumstances are set forth and the world begins to change, bit by bit. The creature is coming, and no one can stop it.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Even with these wonderful qualities, the book d-r-a-g-g-e-d for me. At over 500 pages, I felt that the author stretched the story too thin. I realize that Mr. Klein needed to get The Ceremonies set down so that the reader could visualize and understand them, but it took soooo long to do that; I had to force myself to keep reading the mid-sections of the novel. Also, Rosie, this incredibly powerful old man who can snap enemies in half and stuff them into hide-a-bed sofas, gets killed by wasps. By wasps! That didn't sit well with me. I also didn't like the fact that he developed several characters so well, making the reader form a nice reading relationship with them, and then snuffed them out (perhaps the author was trying to balance life and death in the book, but it didn't work for me).<br /><br />Even so, I'm sure there are some readers out there who would absolutely love this book. I believe it is Mr. Klein's only novel, and thus probably makes it coveted by certain horror afficionados.---------------------------------------------------- <br />  <br />Even with these wonderful qualities, the book d-r-a-g-g-e-d for me.

Sonny, a hot-head who is difficult to control, but a loving son and caring family man who will ultimately be brought down by his own temper; Freddie, a coward but able businessman with connections in Las Vegas which will help launch the Corleone family into the West and onto an entirely new \\"empire\\"; and of course Michael, the silent and calculating son who will end up leading the family after the Don's death.<br /><br />Some critics claim that Puzo created his own sub-genre (the \\"Eastern\\") when this novel burst onto the literary scene. I tend to agree. I've never read anything quite like it, and it deserves all of the attention it got (the films, the academy awards, the spawning of multiple TV and movie spinoffs like 'The Sopranos', etc.). Other critics have lambasted Puzo's prose for it's simplicity. Although there is some truth to this, I find it hard to imagine the book written any other way! But this isn't what draws the reader in; it's the characters and all of the terrible events they find themselves in. Will they find a way out? Can the families coexist without tearing each other apart?

LiteraTech? Oh yes! This is an alternate history, and it starts in 1985 England where the Crimean War has been raging against the Imperial Russian Army for over 130 years and Wales is an independent state. Literature is taken VERY seriously--you can go to jail for misquoting Byronic verses and Baconian enthusiasts go door-to-door in an attempt to discredit Shakespeare. Everyone is \\"into\\" the classics here (so much so that the LiteraTechs are part of an extensive police force), and one man, Acheron Hades, has seized Ms. Next's \\"mad as pants\\" uncle and appropriated his device known as `The Prose Portal'. This allows its owner to actually step into a book. And if the owner of the Prose Portal has the original manuscript, he or she can change the story completely. Oh the horrors! When Hades steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit by Charles Dickens, and kills one of the minor characters, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Thursday Next is on the job! She's one of the few people who actually knows what Hades looks like and has survived several of his \\"attacks\\". Along our way to capture Mr. Hades, we meet some interesting characters and find out that a new terror has been conducted against literature by the evil man: Hades has stolen the original Jane Eyre manuscript and taken Jane Eyre out of it!  Whoa! Can Thursday Next conquer such a dastardly villain? You won't know until the final page.<br /><br />Lots of accolades have been thrown upon this book, and I have to admit that I enjoyed it immensely (the characters, the alternate reality, the literary references, all added to my enjoyment of the story). It's also a very breezy read. If you're looking for light-as-air reading material, you couldn't go wrong here. But being a writer myself, I couldn't help but notice that Mr. Fforde (the author) starts the book in a first person narrative and occasionally switches to third person. Although some authors do this intentionally (for story flow, etc.), I felt here that the author did it more for the plot than to aid the flow of the story. It left me feeling a bit cheated.

No, that's just the tip of the iceberg for Kathryn.<br /><br />An airline investigator, Robert Hart, has come to Mrs. Lyons' house to give her and her daughter (Mattie) the bad news. But he's also there for another reason: to find out how much Kathryn REALLY knew about her husband. Come to find out, she didn't know him well at all.<br /><br />Jack had been leading a double life, assuming matrimonial duties on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and Kathryn is about to come face to face with her polygamist rival in England. And she soon makes a flurry of other discoveries about her husband that turns her world upside down (was he responsible for the plane crashing?)<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />What makes a book interesting is twofold: #1: you have to write with conviction, knowledge and gripping prose. And the author, Anita Shreve, does this. She's well-groomed in the art of storytelling and that is what kept me reading. #2: the story must be compelling and original. And this is where Mrs. Shreve has fallen short. The `secrets' that get revealed about Jack's life are telegraphed too much to the reader. I knew what was coming long before the author showed me. And there really wasn't anything compelling about the story itself (spouse loses husband, grieves, tries to sort out life, makes shocking discoveries about her former mate, finds new love, comes to emotional terms with her life, moves on). Pretty standard fare, I'd say.<br /><br />I'd never read an \\"Oprah's Book Club Selection\\" before (March 1999), and I'd have to say that I was pretty disappointed in this choice.

It is, of course, one of King's early novels, and we can see the author at his peek. The horrors he reveals (from family dynamics to supernatural burial grounds) are chilling enough to scare the bejesus out of the sternest of hearts!<br /><br />The story revolves around the Creed family and their move from a bustling Chicago suburb to quiet Bangor, Maine, where the father (Louis) starts work as a physician. He brings with him his wife and two children (Ellie, a preteen daughter, and Gauge, a preschool boy still in diapers). The house they move into is beautiful with plenty of land for the children to play on, and a nice old neighbor couple across the \\"road\\", the Crandalls. It is this \\"road\\" that causes some immediate concern to Louis as Judd Crandall tells him about the deaths of animals caused by the big semi-trucks that blaze down its blacktop.<br /><br />Judd becomes friends with the family and eventually takes them (or rather is drawn into taking them) on a small path behind the Creed's house that leads to a very special place: the PET SEMATARY. This is the place where most of the animals that'd been killed on the \\"road\\" are buried. It's a strange place with concentric circles, the shape the multiple graves make as they are laid out against the well-kept grounds. Louis and Ellie notice a large deadfall tree and Judd warns them not to climb it because it is too dangerous. But there's more to the story than that. What lay beyond the deadfall tree?<br /><br />Ellie's cat, Church, is eventually killed on the \\"road\\", and Judd and Louis decide to bury the cat, but not in the PET SEMATARY; they go beyond, over the deadfall, and into a very special place known as the Micmac burial grounds, a place that has existed since the Earth began, and has the power in its soil to bring back the dead. But at what cost?<br /><br />\\"Has anyone ever buried a human being back there?\\" Louis asks Judd.<br /><br />\\"Don't even think such a thing, Louis!\\" Judd replies.<br /><br />Church returns to the living, but is much changed. The cat smells foul, and has a very cold and evil manner about it. But at least Ellie has her cat back, right?<br /><br />Eventually the \\"road\\" takes more than just an animal of the Creed's. In a horrific set of narratives, Mr. King draws us into what might happen if humans were brought back from the dead. What happens to our soul if we're brought back? Does it come with us? Or does it stay on the Micmac grounds? Or perhaps something in-between?<br /><br />This book will, in every sense of the word, \\"freak\\" you out!

The glory days of the comic book come to life in this Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Chabon. Unlike Chabon's earlier works (The Mysteries of Pittsburg and Wonder Boys), which seemed a bit stymied by their shorter lengths, the author here is able to broaden the characters and landscapes, giving the reader a much greater feel for people, places and times.<br /><br />The story begins with Samuel (Clay) Klayman being awakened by his mother as his cousin, Joseph Kavalier, arrives in America from war-torn Prague, having escaped the tyrannies of the Third Reich's Jewish persecution. Joseph, though, had to leave his family behind in Europe (his mother, father, and brother, Thomas, as well as dear friends like his magician tutor).<br /><br />Joseph can't get over the feeling that something horrible is befalling his friends and family back in Prague. But he's just a very young man. What can he do? Come to find out, a lot more than he ever thought. Sam soon discovers that Joe can draw comic book sketches as well as Da Vinci painted. And with Sam's ability to write great stories, they soon launch into a profitable and controversial empire of comic book superheroes (The Escapist, Luna Moth, etc.). With their first ever episode, Joseph and Sam's `Escapist' delivers a powerhouse punch to Hitler's bloody jaw. Since America isn't in the war...yet, this begins a series of chess-like moves between what Joe wants to accomplish with his art and those who print the comics.<br /><br />The battles between real life artists Joe and Sam and their big-bad superheroes who fight the world's evils against the backdrop of WW II pulls this story along at an incredible pace (even at 639 pages).

The glory days of the comic book come to life in this Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Chabon. Unlike Chabons earlier works (THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH and WONDER BOYS), which seemed a bit stymied by their shorter lengths, the author here is able to broaden the characters and landscapes, giving the reader a much greater feel for people, places and times. <br />The story begins with Samuel (Clay) Klayman being awakened by his mother as his cousin, Joseph Kavalier, arrives in America from war-torn Prague, having escaped the tyrannies of the Third Reichs Jewish persecution. <br />Joseph feels helpless and lost in America. He cant get over the feeling that something horrible is befalling his friends and family back in Prague. But hes just a very young man. What can he do? <br />Come to find out, a lot more than he ever thought. Sam soon discovers that Joe can draw comic book sketches as well as Da Vinci painted. And with Sams ability to write great stories, they soon launch into a profitable and controversial empire of comic book superheroes (The Escapist, Luna Moth, etc.). With their first ever episode, Joseph and Sams Escapist delivers a powerhouse punch to Hitlers bloody jaw. Since America isnt in the war...yet, this begins a series of chess-like moves between what Joe wants to accomplish with his art and those who print the comics. <br />The battles between real life artists Joe and Sam and their big-bad superheroes who fight the worlds evils against the backdrop of WW II pulls this story along at an incredible pace (even at 639 pages). Not to mention Chabons crisp and concise use of narration in his prose! All of the characters are well thought out, necessary to the story, and make you sympathize with their various causes (from trying to bring Joe Kavalier back to the real world after a series of terrible events, to the ridiculous claims of homosexuality in comic book characters after a main protagonist is exposed as a gay man).<br />In the end this story is about accepting what we cannot change (but never giving up on trying), and those tight relationships that form out of respect, family and mutual understanding. <br />Some might be put-off by the words comic books and its connotations within the book and this review.

And this seems to be the highlight of her life. Or just a passing note . . . I'm not too sure. And so, problems began to prop up as I read along, wondering where the author/narrator was going with the story. Come to find out, she goes absolutely nowhere. We never really leave her home state of Texas, and we never establish a viable storyline.<br />To start out, Mrs. Friedall has serious problems with narrative flow. There isn't one for the first 70 pages or so (and occasionally even after that). On almost every page she jumps from time to time and subject to subject with no rhyme or reason. The book reads like a child's recounting of her diary.<br />There's a rule among novelists, too, that Mrs. Friedall is not applying: show, don't tell. She tells the reader everything rather than showing them. I know how she feels, what the room feels like, what her boyfriends/husbands do and how they react because she told me. I know where she was when John Kennedy was shot because she told me. She didn't show me any of these items, thus making the book read like a recounting of places, times and events. Not engaging reading.<br />Add to this fact that she never tells us (at least within in the first 60 pages) the names of any of her prime family members, or even her own name, and you can see why I didn't become involved with any of the characters. Ever. We have to guess what the A.S. on the cover of the book stands for (Alice is her first name, I think, but what the S. stands for I still don't know).<br />And here's the final nail in the proverbial literary coffin for this book: Mrs. Friedall's life just isn't that interesting. I'm sorry to say something that sounds so meanspirited but it's true. I know I would never DREAM of writing about my life and publishing it. I'm not that interesting either. The only thing she seems to want to get across to the reader is how unfair her parents treated her, and how she seeks acceptance from them at every crossroads in her life. Although this is true of most people, we don't want someone else to tell us about it through weak narration and, what seemed to me at least, whining (&quot;My parents never loved me&quot; or &quot;I chose all the wrong paths and husbands because my parents never loved me&quot; or &quot;I had a baby so that my parents would love and accept me&quot;). This got very, very, very, very tiresome after a short while.<br />I will say that Mrs. Friedall had an excellent line editor (or editors). Her spelling, punctuation, grammar and syntax are all perfect. This may sound like a minor point, but it isn't. With some of the poorly edited material that FWOMP Book Review has received in the past, this was refreshing from that standpoint.

She has problems, though.  An author, Mr. Mandrake, believes that NDEs are the beginning of God's heavenly message...and to prove his point he's written multiple best-selling novels on the subject and tries to beat Joanna to the interviews with patients who experience them.  The trouble is, though, is that Mr. Mandrake leads his interviewees down his personalized ambrosial path by asking questions like, \\"So when did you see the heavenly light?\\" and \\"Was your family there waiting for you?\\"<br />This really ticks off Joanna...<br />She asks questions like, \\"Tell me what you saw?\\" and \\"How did you feel?\\"  Non-leading questions, in other words.  And if she get's to the patients before Mr. Mandrake does, the results are markedly different; no angels of light and no family waiting for you.<br />Enter Dr. Richard Wright.  He's also interested in NDEs.  And he has medical research in mind. He's developed a drug that induces a type of artificial NDE and begins using it on volunteers (with Joanna's eventual help), trying to discover why some people have NDEs and others don't. If he can find out, maybe he can utilize his research to bring dying patients out of their NDE state and back to the living.<br />Maisie is a ten year old child who's been brought back from death multiple times thanks to a congenital heart defect.  And she's Joanna's and Dr. Wright's friend.  She thinks that Mr. Mandrake is a flake (which, of course, he is) and is fascinated with disaster stories (like the Titanic and Hidenburg).  She's never seen an angel or Godly light during her true NDEs, and Joanna and Dr. Wright soon come to rely on her more than they will ever know.<br />****************************************************************<br />Undeniably, Connie Willis is one of my favorite authors.  I love almost everything I've ever read by her.  Her prose is smooth, her characters memorable, and her subject matter relevant.  And PASSAGE is no exception.  Joanna, Maisie, Dr. Wright, Kit, Mr. Briarly, Vielle, and Mr. Mandrake all still stick out in my mind.  Great characters one and all.<br />My only beef with this novel (as many other reviewers here have pointed out) is that it's a bit wordy.  At 780 pages (paperback), I began to lag a bit while reading.  But only a bit!  I tiny bit!  Mrs. Willis' able writing abilities kept me involved in the story and I persevered.<br />The ending:  For those who enjoy everything tidied up and in one neat little plot developed package, this book is not for you.

Star has kept many secrets from her son, but on her deathbed she reveals a whopper: who his father is.  Ned's paternal heritage had always been in question and now, after years of wondering, he has a name.  But an enigmatic one.  No one is willing to talk about Ned's father, especially Ned's mysterious and (apparently) powerful aunts, May, Nettie and Joy.  And by &quot;powerful&quot;, I mean supernatural powers (telekenesis, teleportation, etc.).<br />Ned goes on a quest to discover who his father is and why he's been having such hellish nightmares all his life.  He witnesses murders through the eyes of someone and is unable to pull himself away from these horrific scenes.  And Ned soon discovers that he too has a dark side.  Someone (who might be his brother) &quot;shadows&quot; him and helps protect him from harm by any means possible (including eliminating anyone or anything that gets in his way).<br />Ned soon discovers his own supernatural potential, as well as some interesting family tree information.<br />The most interesting thing about this book was that it held you in a place and you knew EXACTLY where you were.  I loved that.  The twisting of characters and showing their good and dark sides also aided me (as the reader) in realizing that these were fully formed and error-prone people (not just totally good protagonists and totally bad antagonists).<br />My only disappointment was that I would have liked to have seen a more definitive connection between Ned's life and his love of music.  I felt that got dropped by the wayside a bit because of the necessity of Mr. Straub to reveal Mr. X's life and family heritage.<br />But all in all a good read.<br />Rating = A	2004-05-10

A cognizant supercomputer with the ability to learn. Simon is installed at the University in a small, dungeon-like basement where Ross and his cohorts have decided to see if the computer can learn the English language (anyone who knows anything about language knows that English is EXTREMELY difficult to learn).<br />What Ross and his eager band of computer enthusiasts hadn't counted on, though, was how sensitive Simon could be. One of the walls in the computer basement abuts against a large holding tank for dolphins. And before Professor Erricson and his team can begin to see how intelligent their new computer is, Simon begins to communicate with the clicking and whistling dolphins. And what Simon learns and passes on to Ross and his team is startling. Too much so for this reader.<br />Being a lover of fiction, one has to suspend belief when you're reading a novel. But not totally. For instance, in this novel:<br />First, you'd have to believe that Professor Erricson and his rag-tag team could win this supercomputer over such colleges as Yale and Harvard. Not impossible.<br />Second, you'd have to believe that - after winning the competition - they'd be allowed to store this incredibly expensive and delicate piece of computing hardware in a damp, dank basement. Okay.<br />Thirdly, you'd have to believe that dolphins understand and communicate using the same spatial terms humans do (time in years, distance in feet or miles, names of places, etc.). Umm...okay.<br /> ...<br /> ...<br /> ...<br />Okay, I've gone on far enough with this tangent. Some of you may be asking, &quot;So why three stars?&quot; Mainly because I have the audio version of this book. The audio version is done exceptionally well. Professional sounding, good voice-overs and special sound effects add to the enjoyment of the storytelling; I listened to this during a long trip I was taking. But even with these fine qualities, the glaring unbelievability of the story smacked me in the face (or mind, if you prefer).<br />The initial flow of the book was well done (thus the three star review). We had character development and plot points all lined up. Nicely done. But by the time we get 3/4 of the way through, many characters fall away, new one's are introduced (quite distracting), and old plot threads are left dangling while new one's are thrust upon us. Some serious editing help might have been beneficial here.<br />The one question that lingered in my mind when I finished listening to this audio CD was, &quot;Would I have been able to finish reading this if I'd picked up a printed copy?&quot; I still question myself on that but am not brave enough to purchase the book, too.

Then life got busy and I pretty much forgot about it.  But occasionally I'd see it on the bookshelves at my local library or bookstore and an itch would start in the back of my mind, telling me that I should revisit its magical pages.  So this Winter, I did . . .<br />How wonderful it is to visit such a fully realized world created by the human mind, but set in an anthropomorphic background (and foreground, too!).<br />The story is about a band of rabbits---Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, Dandelion, and Bluebell---who set off from their comfy holes to find a new rabbit warren on the plains of Watership Down.  They leave their original warren because Fiver (a small, brooding rabbit with 'The Sight') has a vision of it being destroyed.  Not surprisingly, soon after they leave, they find out that the warren HAD been destroyed by big hrududil (tractors) that dug up the ground and killed all those who remained behind.<br />The trials and tribulations of Hazel and his band of rogue rabbits carries the story along at a leisurely pace, not rushing to get the story out, giving rabbit history and mythology a few well-deserved pages, too.<br />After Hazel and his fellow bunnies set up their new warren on Watership Down, though, they find that they have a serious problem: no does (females)!  Without does, their new warren is doomed to failure, so they set about trying to locate some breeding stock.  But what they encounter is a terrible warren known as Efrafa run by the overbearing and callous General Woundwort.  The battle between Watership Down and Efrafa is terrible and exciting reading, even for adults.<br />One other thing that struck me about reading this book (even years later) is that there are so many things discussed in it  of an adult nature; rabbit miscarriages, battles, sexual connotations, death and dying, all are covered within these simple pages.  And it's done so effortlessly (thank you Mr. Adams), the story's flow is NEVER interrupted.<br />This book was first published in 1972 (a limited release no less) in England; the publisher wasn't sure if it would be well received since it really wasn't a children's tale, nor adult literature.  Thank GOD they took a chance on it.  If they hadn't, we would surely have been denied a true literary classic.<br />A+ rating.attles, sexual connotations, death and dying, all are covered within these simple pages.

Many have compared Mr. Moore to the late, great Douglas Adams (of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame) and I think this is a fair comparison.  If you like Adams' style, you're sure to enjoy Moore's.<br />Fluke is a departure for Mr. Moore from his previous novels.  He's done research for the others, but that research was always used to further the laughs you were sure to enjoy in his books.  But here, Mr. Moore tended to plug whale research (a worthy cause, no doubt!) and the scouring of our ocean environments, and the comedy . . . well . . . got lost a bit.  Even in the afterword to the book, Mr. Moore tells us about the extensive research he did in putting this book together. Interesting, but it's not WHY readers have been drawn to his stories.<br />But let's get into the book. As stated above, this story focuses on whales. Particularly the Humpbacks around Hawaii. Nathan Quinn and a band of scientists (with the recent addition of a truly memorable pothead character named Kona) are trying to find out why the whales sing. And why it is ONLY the males that sing. What does the song mean? This is Mr. Quinn's life work.<br />. . . And Mr. Quinn and his fellow scientists are about to make a hilarious and startling discovery. They soon learn WHY the whales sing (I'm not going to tell you why. You've got to read it to find out). The interactions between the characters is what sets this story apart. That and the story about the giant whale penises mixing with a zodiac inflatable boat!<br />Is it possible that the ocean is a giant living . . . uh, thing? Or Goo? Is it possible that whales are more<br />intelligent 'internally' than we could have ever imagined? Is it possible to fall in love with a nonhuman sea creature? Whoa!<br />A good read. Not great. Not Moore's greatest by a looong shot. But still a lot better than some of the junk that's out there on the shelves. I'm glad I read it.<br />A solid 'B' rating.eat.

He's been accused of raiding burial sites by Native Americans and now he's in the Alps and finds three Neanderthals in an ice cave, amazingly preserved. One of the corpses is a baby, too! But not a Neanderthal baby. This one looks more Cro-magnun. What's up with that?<br />Kaye Lang is in the Republic of Georgia working on a business deal for her genetics company when she is summoned to the site of a mass grave. Bullet riddled bodies are strewn everywhere.  But this site isn't that old, maybe 30 years or so. And many (or most) of the victims appeared to be pregnant women!<br />What has and is happening again, is evolution. As humans now understand the theory of evolution, changes in our DNA and other genetic codes take place over millions of years. But what if it didn't happen that way? What if --- tucked inside some random stretch of genetic material --- an evolutionary time-bomb ticked and suddenly went off? What if radical changes in human evolution came in one or two generations?<br />In DARWIN'S RADIO, author Greg Bear shows us the terror this might instill in the general public. As women catch a 'disease' known as Herod's Flu (or SHEVA by it's technical name), they miscarry a normal baby. But then become impregnated by another fetus instantly; almost a type of asexual reproduction.  Husbands and boyfriends at first accuse their partners of infidelity. Later, women believe that men are the carriers of Herod's Flu and reject men as partners. Riots erupt. Hospitals are quarantined. And soon, a new species is born from many mothers . . . including Kaye Lang (who becomes romantically involved with Mitch).<br />The human response to the science is what drew me into this story. Although this novel is considered Hard SF, I didn't have any trouble following Mr. Bear's line of thinking. He pulled me along and I came willingly. VERY WILLINGLY. Even when he had to delve into the genetic code and how SHEVA interacted with it (us).<br />The story ends on a near cliff hanger, meaning that I'll HAVE TO buy the next book (DARWIN'S CHILDREN).

Second, I'm the type of reader who enjoys character driven stories rather than plot or technologically driven stories.  So this is probably why I didn't enjoy this book.  That and I hate to read futuristic stories with modern cliches in them.  And this book was LOADED with them.<br />The crux of the story focuses around Martin Springfield (an engineer) and Rachel Mansour (a U.N. diplomat) as they travel aboard a spaceship toward Rochald's World, which has been overrun by technology and fancy by the arrival of something called 'The Festival'. The Festival are information gatherers and, in return for information, they give back...well...whatever your heart desires (youth, health, intelligence, an impenetrable home, etc.).  For a world that is stuck in the post-industrial age, this is disastrous.  And the military dispatches a fleet to deal with this 'Festival' and bring Rochald's World back in line.<br />Of course, all does not go as planned.  Everyone has a different agenda as to how to deal with this threat and the future of the planet.<br />And that's about it.  Really.  Oh sure, you can go on about how great the author developed the post-industrial society, the time travel technology, the corruption of governments in order to keep themselves in power.  But lost amongst this...this...this mess, were the characters!  Mr. Stross seems to enjoy telling us about every switch that gets set, and every lever that gets pulled.  He often loses us when he goes on and on and on about how certain technologies work.  This pulls us away from the characters for so long that we lose site of the story itself (at least it did for me!).<br />Example:  'The gamma-ray traces lit up on the main screen, labeled icons indicating their position and vector relative to the system ahead.

I don't consider myself a genius, but nor am I a 'dope' either.  I read a lot of material every year and even if I don't enjoy a book, I usually don't feel completely lost.

Jack Forman is a stay at home dad after being fired as a computer analyst for a respected company in Silicon Valley.  His life begins to fall apart shortly after this: he suspects his wife, Julia, is having an affair (she comes home each night and showers before doing anything else), he can't find a local job to save his life, and now one of his three kids (the baby) is sick!  She screams and screams and screams inconsolably until she's put in an MRI machine at a local hospital.  What happened there?<br />What happened is that nano-machines (tiny machines designed by man for tasking...whether it be medical or, let's say, military applications) were on Jack's daughter's body.  They were accidentally brought home by Julia.  Jack soon learns that Julia is working for a company called Xymos, a nano-tech, bio-tech firm with a secret base in the Nevada desert.  They've been developing nano-machines for the military to help with spying.  But something has gone amiss and Jack is summoned to help them figure it out.  It seems that a program that Jack wrote called Pred-Prey was instilled into the nano-machines and now they're gaining some form of consciousness, killing things after being 'accidentally' set loose onto the Nevada desert.  Now someone is in DEEP DO-DO!<br />I don't mind techno-babble stories as long as they have strong characters.  But this story dragged due to the overly-descriptive passages on nano-technology and the development of it as an antagonist.<br />I read Timeline last year and wasn't very impressed by that novel either (simply because it read like a screenplay...and, what do you know!  They're making a movie out of it!  You can read my review of THAT story here at Amazon, too.).  My advice to Mr. Crichton would be to not worry about trying to keep up with the techno-world so that you can develop &quot;fresh new ideas.&quot;  Come up with fresh characters and put them in some hairy situations.

I'm sure that many readers will gauge what Thomas Steinbeck does here by the works of his prestigious father. But I chose to read them for the sheer enjoyment of discovering a new author who happens to live in the same area I do. I wasn't disappointed.<br />It is worth noting that Mr. Steinbeck likes to tell his stories with narration, not dialogue. You'll find little of the latter in this collection. But what you WILL find is an anthology of stories that all take place on or near the sea (thus the title), and more readable while sitting around a campfire, giving your kids or family an earful as you read the tales aloud. They'll get a peek into the local legends around the Monterey area that will surely remain with them for years to come.<br />The first story in this collection, 'The Night Guide', is about a young boy named Frank Post (of local Post Ranch fame) and his early heritage growing up as a half-breed Native American. When his mother (a native Rumsen Indian) goes missing during a terrible storm, young Frank is visited by a vision and shown where his mother is at. The child rescues his mother from underneath a downed tree. The boy becomes somewhat legendary because of this event. That, and he was probably 'the first child born in the high Sur under the American flag.'<br />'The Wool Gatherer' pays homage to Thom Steinbeck's father.  Young J.E. Steinbeck Jr. works his summers as a ranch hand down in Big Sur on The Post Ranch, and on his way to the ranch one summer, John sees a legendary beast staring down at him from a high cliff vantage point. Then it vanishes. John squanders away his entire summer trying to find the creature again, but never does.<br />'Blind Luck' is the story about a boy named Chapel Lodge who has to make his own destiny and his own luck after his parents abandon him on the central coast. Chapel becomes an able seaman and heroic figure during the sinking of the Los Angeles near Point Sur.<br />'An Unbecoming Grace' is a cute little junket that ponders the fate of men based on their social graces and caring of one another. When a local doctor (Doc Roberts) is called upon to care for a cranky and mean-spirited central coast patient, his ability to uphold the Hippocratic oath will be tested.<br />'The Dark Watcher' is an intriguing tale about Professor Solomon Gill who tries to find out about the ancient tribes that used to encamp on the hills of the Big Sur area. And he soon sees a dark specter just ahead of him . . . on every rise. Is this friend or foe? The tale seems quite dark in the beginning but becomes very light-hearted by the end. This was one of my favorite stories.<br />'Blighted Cargo' is the tale of Simon Gutierrez O'Brian and his evil ways helping in the slave trade on the central coast during its mining days. And fate WILL catch up to him in the end.<br />'Sing Fat and the Imperial Duchess of Woo' is the final story in the book. With a chuckling title like this, who couldn't help but be drawn into it. At near novella length, this is the longest story in the collection and shows Mr. Steinbeck's powerful grasp of characterization. Sing Fat was born in China but forcefully relocated to California. Here he goes from working the mines to an apprenticeship for an apothecary named Chow Yong Fat. And it is with his apothecary teacher that Sing Fat will find the love of his life, the beautiful Sue May Yee.  Thom Steinbeck shows us the power of love and loss during a Chinese 'revolution' on the central coast.<br />Again, a great book to read out loud.

When he goes with the authorities to a murder scene, he's pretty upset about it.  Apparently, the docent for the Louvre Museum has been murdered.  And Mr. Langdon was supposed to have met up with the murder victim several hours prior to his death.  But he says he never did.  Does the investigating detective believe him?<br />Sophie Neuveu is a cryptologist who works for the Paris police.  She gets 'called' into action when it is discovered that the murder victim left a strange message scrawled on the floor of the Museum.  She's also related to someone very involved in this murder case.  Whoa!<br />Mr. Teabing is a Grail enthusiast who has more money than God.  He's been trying to find out the truth behind the Holy Grail and a secret society whom he has discovered was designed to protect it: The Priory of Scion.  This group had some prestigious names affiliated with it too. Leonardo Da Vinci, Gallileo, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and a slew of other historically famous people.<br />Silas is an albino who works for a section of the church known as the Opus Dei.  He's a hit-man with a serious job to do.  If anyone ever found out what the Holy Grail really was and what it represented, the Christian faith might crumble into ruin.  That can't happen.  So Silas is sent out into the world to make sure it doesn't.  He gets his assignments from someone called &quot;The Teacher.&quot;  An invisible person to all except for one person.  Who is this Teacher?<br />The Good:  The pace at which this novel moves is mind-boggling. A reader can whip through it in just a few short days (even the slowest of readers, I would think).  The action is excellent, and so are the historical references that Mr. Brown has thoroughly researched (the Priory of Scion, the Holy Grail, Mary Magdalene, Leonardo Da Vinci, etc. etc. etc.).<br />The 'Not-so-Good':  Do these characters ever sleep?  After being awakened at an un-Godly hour, Robert Langdon and Sophie Neuveu don't rest for days!  That accompanied with their multiple,  miraculous epiphanies as they try to break codes that are designed to be nearly unbreakable, stretched believability several times.<br />I also didn't care much for the ending.  Mr. Brown loves to flip the protagonist/antagonist relationships of his characters.  I don't mind that normally.  But it happened so many times that it became ho-hum after a while.  And I felt that the revealing of the prime antagonist was just a tiny bit forced.  Something used for shock value more than possible reality.  I know, I know, this is fiction, but let's not get too far out here.<br />Even with these faults, I'm glad that I read 'The Da Vinci Code.'  It was worthy of my reading time and it made me look at our current world religions with a new light toward the feminine.<br />B+ read.being awakened at an un-Godly hour, Robert Langdon and Sophie Neuveu don't rest for days!

Her father -- preoccupied with his tuba playing -- swears the noises are caused by mice or rats.  Her mother -- busying herself with bottling jam -- agrees that it is an insect or animal.  Lucy's little brother -- the high score champ on all the houses' video games -- thinks it might be bats.  But Lucy is sure that the bumps and bangs behind the walls are caused by wolves.  \\"Not possible,\\" they all say.  \\"Because if it were wolves, IT would all be over.\\"<br />It is soon discovered, however, that there ARE wolves in the walls, and they erupt into Lucy and her parents' house one night, chasing them out of their home and taking over the residence.  The only item to make it out of the house was her father's primary tuba.  Lucy's pig puppet, her mothers jams and foodstuffs, and her brothers video games are still in the house.  And Lucy sneaks back up to find the wolves taking advantage of all these items (and even abusing her father's 'secondary' tuba).<br />The family soon tires of spending nights out in the garden and decide to take back their home.  The ending is fun and enjoyable.<br />The story is light, non-bloody, and very enjoyable.  Depending on your childrens level of understanding, this might be a very fun book for them.  Mainly for two reasons...<br />One, it shows how a child can have power within her family and become a hero (even though this story is fictional).  Two, the graphic images portrayed by artist Dave McKean are intersted, fresh and original.<br />I've read other reviews from readers here at Amazon and someone said that this story might be 'Too scarey to read to a child.'  I disagree.  There's no bloodshed, or gore, or excess violence.  I think a child would be more frightened by what they read in a newspaper or see on the nightly news, rather than THIS book.<br />A+ children's story and graphics.	2003-10-01

He's being taled by a secret service agent (Griffin) who believes he helped assassinate President McKinley; he can't make enough money to support his own magic shows; finds love and loses it in a most unpleasant manner; and has a horde of people after him, trying to steal his magical ideas (including, amazingly, television).<br />Carter Beats The Devil is an even handed novel that blends fiction and fact with wonderful ease.  The events surrounding McKinley's 'death' have never been completely understood.  Nor has the development of television (which was in the public eye long before the 1940's).  Add to these facts that Charles Carter was a real, live magician, owned the first BMW motorcycle in America, had met Houdini on more than one occasion, and that he was present in President McKinley's room just prior to his passing, and you've got A LOT of material to work with.<br />A fine fictional read that moves in between the shadows of history.  Definitely recommended reading.<br />A- rating.	2003-09-28

To most of us, quantum theory, quarks, and dark matter are as dumbfounding as the end of Pi.  But Mr. Bryson show us the whens, wheres and hows of these items without making us feel like complete idiots.<br />The thing that stood out most in my mind while reading this, was the amount of time it took for the scientific community to accept relevant facts about the Earth and sky.  Einstein, working as a patent clerk, third class, was refused advancement even after his theories showed up on the scientific radar.  He was also shot down when he applied to become a college teacher (NO!) and then denied again as a high school teacher (NO! again).<br />I also found it interesting that scientists continue to be petty, even into the 20th century.  When a meteorologist discovered plate tectonics, his theories were ignored because he wasn't a geologist.  Amazingly, many of the names that Mr. Bryson spills forth on these pages should be lauded within the text books of our children and college students, but aren't.  Mainly because their ideas were stolen away by someone of a more 'appropriate stature.'<br />I liked this book quite a bit, but it didn't grab me as much as Mr. Bryson's travelogues.  He's a great writer, but I still love 'A Walk In the Woods' and 'In a Sunburned Country' much more.  But bravo on this fine accomplishment, too, Mr. Bryson.  Bravo!	2003-09-07

Daeman, an Eloi-like man who lives on Earth in the distant future, has it all; he's moderately handsome, eats when he pleases, has [physical activity] with multiple women, and doesn't have to lift a finger to work.  The Voynix and Servitors (two forms of automated intelligence) do all the work for him and his people.  But his life is soon turned upside down by Savi, the wandering Jew who's lived over 1500 years thanks to cryogenic sleep.  She will teach him and his friends what their life is truly like.  Why can't they live past their fifth 20 (100 years old)?  Where did the Voynix and Servitors come from?<br />Thomas Hockenberry is a 20th century scholar brought back to life in the far future by Zeus and the other gods and goddesses of Olympos.  Hockenberry's prime focus is to monitor the events of Homer's Iliad and report back to the Gods.  Problems arise, though, when Hockenberry is approached by a Muse and told to help her [destroy] one of the Goddesses.  He's given special, god-like equipment to do it, too.  But if he interferes in the events surrounding the Gods and Ilium, what will happen to the past that Hockenberry knows?<br />Mahnmut and Orphu are two Moravecs (part man, part machine) who have been sent by a council of concerned Moravecs to find out what is going on on Mars.  There's so much quantum flux going on there that it could [endanger] the entire galaxy.  Mahnmut is forced into the role of possible destroyer of a planet (Mars).  But he also finds out some interesting things about Mars: Gods live on Olympos!  Little Green Men inhabit the tidal flatlands near the oceans of Mars (Oceans?  Yes, oceans.  Mars has been suddenly terraformed in a very short time). A scholar named Hockenberry could be an ally since he seems to know what the hell is going on.<br />Initially, this novel seemed like a jumble of unrelated stories, but Mr. Simmons (the author) pulls the story together with mastery and cunning.  His ability to put the story of the Iliad into laymen's terms is done so well that the narrative fairly whipped by and never slowed down.<br />I would wager that this book will be seen on the upcoming Hugo and Nebula lists for best science fiction novel of 2003.  I'm putting my money on it.  Welcome back to science fiction, Mr. Simmons.

And Tailchaser has his own agenda, too, that will clash with the world he once thought he knew; he has to find Hushpad, his chosen mate who is one of the cats whos disappeared.<br />As Tailchaser leaps upon this heroes journey, he finds that all is wrong with the cat world.  A strange darkness has descended upon their Ka (spirit), and the further Tailchaser gets from his home, the more prevalent this sensation becomes, weighing him down. Something terrible is amiss.  The cat Gods of long ago may still be battling it out for supremacy.  But how is Tailchaser, a little tabby with a small white star on his head, supposed to help out? He has some help from some companions.  Pouncequick, a youngling feline, starts the journey with Tailchaser. Pouncequick is an energetic but inexperienced hunting cat.  Tailchaser feels him more of a burden (initially) then a benefit. Along the way Tailchaser and Pouncequick pick up Roofshadow, a female feline with more experience in the world then either of them.  Now a trio, this band of brethren cats move from unfamiliar territory to unfamiliar territory, searching for clues to all the cats disappearance.  They soon bump into Eatbugs, a strange cat that speaks incomprehensibly at times.  He follows the trio and becomes a pain in the tail.  But nothing, not even Eatbugs irrationality, couldve prepared them for The Mound: a horrible underground domain built by one of the Ancient Cat Gods.  It is here that Tailchaser and his group of friends find the answers to the disappearing cats.  Tailchaser, along with his companions, must foil the plans of Hearteater, one of the firstborn Gods of this cat-ish realm. Hearteater has unleashed a terrible power upon the world with his evil ways and has created the underground world of The Mound to bring light and darkness under his control.<br />An impressive amount of research went into the writing of this novel.  Most notably is the cat behavior, cat language (singing, not talking, and High Singing), the movement of the moon and sun across the sky as seen from a felines perspective, and much work on the curious names given to all the characters.<br />Now Im not a cat person.  I dont own one and havent been in a home with one since I was a teenager living with my parents (back in the late 70's and early 80's), but this story didnt require that I be so inclined toward cats.

This will become the place where beatniks can come to flaunt their political views, kill a few pigs and generally languor around in the mud like . . . like pigs! But problems arise. Who is George really and how did he get so much money all of a sudden? Why is this Fly continually bothering Billy (renamed to Alexander later in the book because his profile resembles Alexander the Great)?

Most notably is the falling of the author into a travelogue-like diary of places(this was like reading someone's account of their vacation). Mr. Miller also frequently steps into the realm of teacher/preacher. The author tries to \\"tell\\" the reader about the world and it's history, which bogged down the well-written narrative.

Especially if you're writing a biography about this man.  Add to that the fact that you're his son, and you've got a triple-whammy!<br />Brian Herbert (a successful author in his own right) shows us the powerful life of his legendary father, Frank Herbert, in Dreamer of Dune, the biography of Frank Herbert's life.<br />The story surrounds Frank Herbert from his humble beginnings in small town Washington, to his rise to the head of science fiction's most coveted awards (the Nebula and Hugo awards).<br />Brian Herbert takes us on an emotional rollercoaster ride as Frank and his family go from starving in Mexico, to eating caviar in Hawaii.  Then we get let down again as Bev, Frank's love of his life, passes away.<br />Throughout the biography, Brian expertly weaves the life that would lead Frank Herbert to write his magnum opus: Dune.

But I knew it was coming, of course.  History tells us how Caeser died, but Mrs. McCollough SHOWS us.  Thankfully, we get a full dose of Caeser's great mind before that fateful day in the Senate.<br />The prime movers and shakers in this wonderful climax are Caeser, Cleopatra, Brutus, Marcus Antonius, and Octavian.<br />Caeser's Rome is coming together just as the great man had planned.  The city coffers are full, the hungry are eating, most of Rome's enemies have been cowed and civil wars have been avoided.  But all under the hand of Caeser, Rome's 'Dictator for Life.'  Those men who wish to advance their careers and dignitas can only do so at the whim of Caeser's ample mind.  So, a group of &quot;Liberators&quot; decide to end Caeser's rule by killing him.<br />A good portion of the book takes place in Rome during the intervening months prior to Caeser's assasination.  What's amazing is how involved you become, knowing that Caeser MUST fall.  But what of Rome?  What will happen to her once he's gone?  The assasins don't take this into account and thus, once Rome's Dictator is dead, she falls into chaos...<br />Only to be brought back from the brink by the smiling, pretty-boy heir to Caeser's fortune, Octavian.  Amazingly, Octavian isn't a soldier or a very powerful man.  But what he does have is an incredible mind and a head for politics.  He knows how to manipulate men, and how to keep alive the memory of Caeser within himself.  Rome has a way to go before she falls again.  But, as history tells us, fall she will.  Although we never witness it in this book, we can begin to see the downfall of a great empire.  But not until Octavian has had a chance!<br />A wonderful book for those with an interest in history, and quite lengthy at over 700 pages.  All in all, I'd say it's a very worthy read.<br />A- rating.	2003-03-14

There's nothing better when it comes to reading a great book.  And Chris Moore has done it here.  I'd recently read 'Blood Sucking Fiends' also (by Mr. Moore), but found this book even more enjoyable than that novel.<br />The story of 'Island of the Sequined Love Nun' surrounds a man named Tucker Case.  He's a pilot for a successful cosmetic guru lady who believes that image is everything.  So when Tucker, one of her employees, crashes one of her planes while having sex with a prostitute in the cockpit (no pun intended), she has to do something.<br />What happens is that Tucker is sent to a far away island to fly 'supplies' on and off this remote tropical paradise.  Trouble is, he soon finds out that he's NOT transporting supplies, but something far more hideous...and profitable.<br />From talking fruit bats with sunglasses, to impaled male sexual organs, this book is a laugh a minute.  I had snot blowing out of my nose (because I was just getting over a cold) every time I turned a page and started laughing.<br />Pick up a copy and check out how true comedy comes alive on the page.

When she wakes up two nights later under a dumpster with a burned hand, some superhuman observation skills, and incredible strength, she knows that something is amiss.<br />Come to find out, Jody was attacked by a very old vampire who was looking for some company.  Trouble is, this old vampire has had problems with past humans who he turned into his kind.<br />But Jody is different.  She quickly learns (through some hilarious trial and error) what she can and cannot do.  And thanks to C. Thomas Flood, a would-be writer who came to San Francisco to become 'the starving artist and find some excitement,' Jody will become all that she can be.<br />From Midnight frozen turkey bowling at the local Safeway, to drinking binges with massive hangovers and turtles who's demise is determined by bronze sculptors, this book has something for even the most hum-bug reader.<br />This book will remain on my shelf to be read again and again whenever I need a good tickling of my funny-bone.<br />A+ rating.	2002-12-20

There's some old family friction going on thanks to Nick's dead mother and Nick's chosen field of study.  But when Nick goes to an Anasazi site with her father, and she finds a 1937 Packard convertible in an abandoned building, both her and her father are happy with this site...for a while.<br />The Packard, it turns out, belonged to two notorious bank robbers of the past named Knute and Nora.  But Knute and Nora robbed the wrong bank, a bank that had some top secret documents in it that the government wants to remain hidden now that so many years have passed.  Unwittingly, Nick sets into motion a plan to destroy all those who know anything about this old car and the documents it contained.<br />What ensues is a fast paced, action-filled, sleuth-yarn that will keep you reading into the wee-hours of the night.  Will those government killers catch up to Nick, her Dad and her friends?  Will the slimey boys get their just dessert?  Read and see.<br />My only issue I had with the book was its ending; it ended rather abruptly (indicating a sequel maybe?).  And the fact that a love interest of Nick's was killed right in front of her and there was no emotional response also seemed unlikely.  But other than that, this book was a pure joy to read.  It'll stay on my shelf to be read again...later.<br />B+ rating.	2002-12-05

That being said, his prose died with him (big surprise...&lt;insert ironic snuffling noises here>). And contrary to some reviewers ideals, 'The Butlerian Jihad' was part of Frank Herbert's early Dune history. So, no, Brian Herbert and KJA were NOT trying to capitalize on what is currently going on in the world. Which kind of freaks me out: 'How much precognition did Frank have!!'<br />On to the book:<br />We pick up with the thinking machines in control of Earth and many other 'synchronized planets' under the rule of Omnius, a singular computer mind that tells all other thinking machines what to do and what's happening in their universe.<br />Vorian Atreides is the son of Agamemnon, a Titan man/machine with the mind of a human and the body of a mechanical beast. Vorian is a traitor to the human race and believes that humans need to be reigned in so that the Universe can be more easily controlled and comfortable.<br />Xavier Harkonnen is a decorated war hero in charge of the human fighting fleets on various 'human' worlds.<br />Selim is the first Arrakis desert dweller (Fremen isn't their title yet) to ride a sandworm. He believes that Buddallah saved him from the desert so that he could help save Arrakis from eventual destruction and CHOAM over-indulgence on spice (hasn't happened yet, but you know it's coming!).<br />Serena Butler is the daughter of Viceroy Manion Butler on Salusa Secundus. She is beautiful and intelligent and a fighter. She will become what the 'Butlerian Jihad' is all about... she and someone else.<br />Xavier and Vorian are both in love with Serena. What's a girl to do? You won't find out til the end.<br />Erasmus is a thinking machine, trying to figure out (in computer terms) what it is that makes humans tick. And he struggles with this concept throughout the entire book. Unwittingly, he helps get the Jihad moving by making a few crucial errors in his calculations. Erasmus also initially thinks that he can find out what humans are made of by...well...dissecting them in very crude manners. Warning: Don't eat while reading these sections!<br />We also see the development of the Bene Geserit (Zufa Cenva), and their inability to control their powers.<br />And we see the formation of the Holtzman shield and how it will play a pivotal role in the Jihad. In Frank's earlier notes, he said that 'Holtzman didn't completely understand how the field generation worked.' Now, thanks to Norma Cenva (Zufa's stunted daughter) we get to see who found out about the shields and their strengths and weaknesses. We also catch a fleeting glimpse into Norma's brilliant mind as she works through the possibility of fold-space calculations.<br />The authors focus more on actions than words (similar to their previous works) and that can get old at times.

The simple fact that it looks fun on the outside lends itself to an unusual appeal to the common bookstore browser.  That, and having Brian Herbert's name on the cover didn't hurt either!  When I saw this book at my local bookstore in Carmel, California, it was in the local authors section near the science fiction books.  So seeing Mr. Herbert's name on both sides of the aisle was impressive indeed.<br />But what about the book itself?  Well, the stories are wonderful.  The first story, Reunion (by Walter Gourlay) is a fantastic historical recounting of a man who comes back to the Monterey area and finds Stilwell Hall falling into the sea (which it is!).  But he falls asleep and wakes up in a dream? state.  Stilwell Hall is alive with activity and soldiers and beautiful women.  What happened to him?<br />Mortuary Beach (by Mark Angel) is a dramatic account of what can go wrong in the waters off Monestary Beach, near Carmel, my hometown.  Having been to this beach, it makes me shiver now to think how many divers have lost their lives out there.  And Mark Angel's story is now a part of the reason that I shiver.<br />The Lizard Catcher (by Lele Dahle) is a heart-wrenching account of a young girl growing up in Carmel Valley during the 50's and 60's.  The tale is so well told that I cried at the end of it.<br />Monte-Ray Gunn (by Byron Merritt) is a comedy piece that takes place in Monterey in the year 3000.  A hard-bitten detective that talks like Sam Spade has to solve the apparent murder of an alien at the Monterey Bay Aquarium (now the Monterey Intergalactic Aquarium) with the help of a smelly, gelatinous partner who lives in a coffee mug.  I laughed out loud several times while reading this highly comedic story.<br />Borscht in the Bay (by Ken Jones) is practically a study of those who live in the Monterey area!  Elderly, cautious, lock your doors, keep an eye on your neighbor.  Woody, the main character, is a retired military man who watches out for anything suspicious around his hometown of Pacific Grove.  And when he sees Russians coming ashore one early morning, he knows that Monterey has been invaded!  Great stuff there.<br />Resurrected (by Chris Kemp) is the story about a witch who has a nervous breakdown and must go on sabbatical to heal herself.  The town her and her estranged daughter go to is Pacific Grove, an uncannily mirror image of their own hometown of Palo Pacifa. The mother/daughter antics and conversations are spot on and I laughed many times while reading this thoroughly enjoyable story as well.<br />A Flash of Red (by Frances Rossi) is a whodunnit style murder mystery that takes place around a church in Pacific Grove.  The chilling suspensefulness of this story may keep you up late reading.<br />A Place To Heal (by Shaheen Schmidt) is a delightful tale of a man who's lost his life in the high-paced action of the L.A. cities.  And then comes to Big Sur, California to heal himself.<br />If the Tubs Could Talk (by Pat Hanson) is a mellow, relaxing, very short story about a woman who comes to some local hotsprings to unwind, and finds out that some tubs might have voices.  And what would they say if they did have voices?<br />Dot's Dad Visits Dinosaur Town (by Mike Tyrrel) is a fantastic children's fantasy tale about a daughter who takes her disbelieving father to the magical Dinosaur Town (somewhere outside of Salinas!).  This is a wonderful read aloud story for parents to tell their children at bedtime.<br />All in all, this is an amazing collection of short stories.

I'm trying to be picky about giving 5 stars to any book that I've read and reviewed.  But to NOT give the highest rating to this book, I feel, would be a crime.<br />I've read a lot of novels where character development made me get so close, that I had to back off before the ending so I wouldn't become too involved (and find myself yelling, or crying, or generally making a fool of myself wherever I was when I finished the book).  But never, have I had to back off multiple times.  THAT'S how powerful this character is...this Owen Meaney; this instrument of God; this friend I miss now that I've finished the novel.<br />A+ rating.	2002-10-28

This is another weapon/treasure to keep in your writing world's arsenal.<br />The upbeat note that it inflicts upon the reader/writer will not be soon forgotten.  I'm still impressed with the way Carolyn See dishes out the information in this book.  Not only does she give incredibly comedic, heroic and downright interesting information, but she follows most of these up with examples from her own life.<br />You can get to know your target editors by getting to know your target editors.  Sound simple and redundant?  It ain't.  Amazingly, most of the things you'll need to succeed aren't necessarily in your desk or a computer file.  They're in your head and your heart.

US	49883642	R3OJ6A4TXSL3X0	0553564366	165021414	Impossible Things	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Connie Willis, in small doses, is still fun!	I got hooked on Connie Willis after reading `To Say Nothing Of The Dog.' I'm sure those of you who've read that wonderful book can see why. Mrs. Willis has a witticism with characters and events that is thoroughly enjoyable. She also loves to play around with current scientific theory and bounce between characters and...oh, let's say chaos theory.<br />In `Impossible Things' - a short story collection by Connie Willis - we get to see a lot of both.  The first story, The Last Of The Winnebagos, is the typical story that we expect from this author (throw in a reference to an ancient society or tribe but put it in a ridiculous context - here referring to the behemoth RV, not the Native American tribe by the same name). Mrs. Willis throws us into the driver's seat of the future and shows us the Nazism possibilities of a society who's gotten a bit carried away with themselves (here being the SPCA!).<br />The next story, Even The Queen, centers around \\"women's issues.\\" Mainly their menstrual cycles and how they might be seen by future generations (can we really change that much? Mrs. Willis doesn't think so either).<br />`Schwarzchild Radius' is an interesting look at the development of that theory by the title author. Schwarzchild is a radioman in WW II and has a theory about Black Holes and Event Horizons that intrigues the master of mathematics himself, Albert Einstein (mentioned only as a correspondence here). Is Schwarzchild himself at the event horizon with the other men at the front? Or does it just seem that way? They certainly can't get any information to those who desperately need it. Frustration reigns.<br />`Ado' is a comedic look at censorship in the extreme. What makes it so entertaining is Mrs. Willis' interpretation of where our school system is headed with books being banned, censored or generally denied admittance into the hands of readers.<br />`Spice Pogrom' is probably one of the more entertaining reads in this collection. Mainly because it focuses on an alien culture visiting Earth and our misunderstandings of them, or us, or whatever.  Language, culture and futuristic high comedy all figure heavily into the theme of this story as you visit Sony, an orbiting mass in space that is pushed to the limit for living space and those with attention deficit disorders!<br />`Winter's Tale' is the story of `what-if.' What if Shakespeare hadn't really died as we think he did? What if Marlowe had written more? What if our understanding of where the major players in English Literature are based on false pretenses? Then you'll want to read this serious Shakespearean tale that is sure to leave you scratching your head.<br />`Chance' is Mrs. Willis' attempt at the `chick novella.' Chance meetings, unfortunate marriages, and (again) chaos theory, all figure in here.<br />`In The Late Cretaceous' is a similar tale to `Ado' but this time the author looks at our school system from the point of losing classes/curriculums and how teachers would feel (in varying degrees) about this. Why do we need to know about the Dinosaurs? What difference could it make if I know that a T-Rex's Jaw was five feet long with seven inch teeth? The difference is comedic and serious all at the same time.<br />`Time Out' is a fun look at temporal mechanics and how one man's test on a small town school goes awry after wives start leaving husbands and a case of Chicken Pox runs ramped through the children and staff and parents. Funny stuff.<br />`Jack' is an interesting look at how Vampires might have taken advantage of the `nearly dead' during WW II in London (during the German bombing raids). Or is it that the man who sees this `Jack' is simply exhausted and can't think straight. I leave it to you to decide, and so does Mrs. Willis.<br />`At The Rialto' is \\"The gem at the end,\\" as I like to call it. Probably the funniest of the reads in the book, this story focuses on Dr. Ruth Barringer, a quantum physicist, who is trying to find out where the lectures onthe `Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle' are being held. And if you don't know what that is, don't worry; you will by the end of this entertaining short story.<br />Enjoy them all, that would be my advice. I loved the beginning and the end of the book, but the stories in the middle dragged at times.

That's the best word to describe this novel.  It's just flat-out fun.  I'm hoping that some younger readers will pick up this book then, when they've finished it, will seek out the many book references to Jules Verne that accompany this story.  I know that'd put a lot of smiles on English teachers faces.<br />So what's the big deal with yet ANOTHER story about Captain Nemo?  Well, Mr. Anderson has taken that tale and put a bit of a twist into it; he's made Andre' Nemo a real-life friend of Jules Verne in which Verne uses in his literary works.  And it's a fast enjoyable read.<br />Maybe too fast.<br />Years fly by with abandon and it is sometimes difficult to fathom the time scale that the author bounds through.<br />There're also a few basic problems that I encountered:<br />In the beginning, when Nemo is getting ready to become cabin boy to the Captain onboard a merchant vessel, he is accepted thanks to the family ties of the lovely Caroline (an adolescent love interest of both Nemo and Verne).  Verne longs to go and decides to steal away with Nemo on the vessel.  But there are no arrangements made with the Captain for Verne's acceptance onto the ship.  He just shows up on the boat and is miraculously admitted into the Captain's favor as a `second' cabin boy.  Too convenient there.  A Captain would always know who was sailing with him long before they left port and this was never addressed.  A weak point in the story.<br />Also, I've got problems with the rehashing of old material in books.  I've heard from multiple sources that Jean Auel's new book, `Shelters of Stone,' does this terribly, and it seems to be a continuing trend.  Is it the authors, I wonder?  Or the editors requiring this?  But telling us again and again and again about the Crimean War and how it affected Nemo got a bit tiresome.  As did recapping all of Nemo's experiences in the last 30 pages of the book.  I know this already.  Don't preach it to me.<br />But all in all this was a breezy read.  I whipped through the book in a few days and got caught up a few times in the story, remembering how much I'd loved Verne's `20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,' and all its nuances.<br />As I said earlier, I'm hoping this book will make a few younger readers seek out original Verne books and get a taste of some old literary works.  I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.  Mr. Anderson can smile about that, I'm sure.ng all of Nemo's experiences in the last 30 pages of the book.  I know this already.

I guess I'm what you'd call a SF fanatic.  I love to read it in all forms (short stories, flash fiction, space operas, historical SF, theoretical manipulation, etc.), but Ringworld fell flat for me.<br />The story surrounds four characters: two humans, a two headed 'puppeteer' (who seems to be the equivalent of the cowardly lion with substantial brainpower), and a Kzin (just picture an eight foot Tony-the-Tiger with claw killing capabilities of Edward Scissorhands).  These four head out to a newly discovered Ring around a sun some 200 light years from known space.  Teela Brown (a human woman) goes along with the group because of her breeding (she was bred for luck), Louis Wu (the other human) goes along because of his past experiences with alien cultures, Nessus (Puppeteer) is the defacto controller of many events as the story unfolds and is part of the founding society that discovered the 'Ringworld,' and Speaker-To-Animals is the Kzin (a warrior race) who joins the group because of his killing skills and prowess.<br />The characters are shallow and rarely believable.  The story unfolds in an almost amateurish fashion and there were several times where I let the book slide from my hand and laughed at it.  Seriously laughed at it!  How could this have won the Hugo and Nebula awards?  Indeed 1970 must have been a VERY bad year.<br />But if the characters were bad (and they were), the science was good.  And this is what tended to shine through, throughout the story.  Mr. Niven takes great joy in explaining the Ringworld structure, the strings that hold the various shadow sections in place (yes, I know...it's a puppet analogy...but so what, it's weak in character), the spaceship travel times and drive systems, the flycycle controls, etc. ad nauseum.  If he'd spent half that time developing the characters into fully fledged personas and the cultures they encountered (which are TERRIBLY lacking in development) into fully understandable societies, I would have enjoyed this novel 200 percent better.  But as it stands, it's a poor book from my perspective.  It needs much more, and it simply didn't have it.

US	49883642	RQ383YXWITEUT	0553575384	291987598	To Say Nothing of the Dog	Books	4	31	40	N	Y	This the story, that made me laugh, that made milk shoot...	...from my nose, that the cat drank off the floor, in the house that Jack built!  Wow.  What a fun novel!  This 1999 Hugo award winning book was a sheer joy to read.  Miss Willis certainly has done her research on Victorian England.  I felt like I was there.<br />The story takes place in the very near future (between 2000 and 2100) and is told in the first person by a time-traveling reconstructionist named Ned Henry.  Ned's boss, Lady Shrapnell, is ruthless in her pursuit of knowledge about a particular item known as 'The Bishop's Bird Stump.'  Lady Shrapnell is rebuilding Coventry Cathedral (which was destroyed during WWII in a German bombing raid), and will stop at nothing to recreate as much of the cathedral as she can.  She has EVERYONE working on this project.  Even some who shouldn't be.  Or maybe, some who no longer should be.<br />Enter Ned Henry, our narrator for the novel, who is in serious need of some sleep.  He has 'time-lag,' which is basically the worst jetlag you could imagine, but with some serious mental repercussions: it makes the time-traveler recite poetry and become loving of all things, as well as making the poor time-lagged individual have DDS (Difficulty Distinguishing Sounds) and a few other uproariously uncomfortable things.  But Lady Shrapnell needs Ned to find this damn bird stump...so she won't let him rest.<br />Enter Verity, a beautiful time-traveler who happens to be in Victorian England in 1888 with Ned.  Does Ned fall in love with her, and she with him, or are they both just severely time-lagged?  If their mental capacities aren't completely up to par, how on earth are they going to find this bird stump?  What do the people of Victorian England think of these two strangers who dress like them, but don't necessarily act like them?<br />With all its 'bolderdashes' and the like, this book pulls off some incredibly rousing comedy and I loved the ending.  It wrapped everything up nicely but left you wondering 'Where do we go from here?'<br />The book has its faults, however; which is why I gave it four stars and not five.  The first sixty pages of the novel dragged for me, but after that, it picked right up and kept me interested for the most part.  There were also a few times when Ned does several 'jumps' into the past (rapid successive jumps) but doesn't get time-lagged...so that seemed a bit convenient.<br />Even so, a highly enjoyable read with lots of historical comedy and futuristic techno-babble; acceptable techno-babble.  Not overly so.<br />Pick it up and read it.  It's pretty light and pretty hilarious.m here?' <br />The book has its faults, however; which is why I gave it four stars and not five.

If he had something more original to write about, I think his books would win applause from even the most stubborn literary fan.  But he doesn't do that here...but still, he MAKES us care about his characters by getting us in so close and so intimate with them that we can't help but care!<br />The story is that of two friends, Ed Tully and Connor Ford.  They have other jobs and live half a continent away from each other, but they come together every summer to become Smoke Jumper brethren in and around Montana.  Smoke Jumpers are those slightly psychotic and carelessly heroic few firefighters who jump out of planes near fire-lines and dig fire-breaks and try to foil mother-nature's red tongued devils.  Ed and Connor have a tight bond of friendship that is unshakable because of their smoke jumping past.<br />Enter Julia Bishop, a beautiful, intelligent, and caring woman who hooks up with Ed.  Ed, of course, wants to introduce her to Connor, and soon does.  Connor is immediately struck with her beauty (both internal and external) as is Julia struck with him.  But they deny their feelings for one another because of Ed (Connor's long friendship with him and Julia's caring for him).  Soon Ed gets injured and is blinded during a raging fire and Julia and he are thrown closer together by this.  Connor is moved further out, but he still cares for her greatly.  Ed proposes and Julia accepts.  Connor moves further out.  Soon, it is learned that Ed cannot have children due to his diabetic history and poor medication choices in the past.  So they (Julia and Ed) ask Connor to be a sperm donor.  Connor agrees and Amy enters the world throwing all kinds of emotions around.<br />How does it end?  What happens to Connor and Julia?  Or will there ever be a Connor and Julia?  Does Ed know how his best buddy feels about his wife?  And what of Amy, the child of Connor's genes and Julia's womb?  How does this mess settle itself into a legitimate storyline?  It does.  And does well.<br />It is an old story told time and time and time again, and that's one of the reasons that I gave it only four stars.  It is also schmaltzy in places and highly predictable...but still....darn it! You can't help but care about these people.  I found myself getting choked up a few times as I read what befell some of them.<br />It's a fun book and reads breezily, but has it's weak points.

This novel was also well planned and delivered but became a bit wordy as time went by.  I think Mr. Gaiman needed a slightly better editor for the piece.  But his research and obvious enjoyment of the material (mythological gods) came shining through.<br />The story revolves around a recently released convict named Shadow.  He'd spent some time in jail for assault and was ready to come out and rejoin society...and he does...except as soon as he's released he learns that his wife just died in a car accident while performing a not-so-flattering act of adultry on his best friend (who was driving and was also killed).  Thrown into society and now dealing with his wife's funeral, Shadow soon meets up with a stranger named Wednesday.  Wednesday, as it turns out, is one of many of the Gods that Shadow will bump into on this long journey into Godhood.  Godhood?  That's right, Godhood.  Shadow learns his lineage with the help of Wednesday and soon all the pieces of the story begin to fall into place.<br />There's also a pivotal battle that builds from the beginning of the novel til near the end (the war of the Gods from the old world --- Odin and such --- versus the Gods of the new world --- the internet Gods, TV gods, etc.).  But this is merely a big sideline to the main story: the development of Shadow into his rightful place.<br />Which Gods are in here?  Well I'm not exactly sure of all of them (indeed I'm not sure if anyone except a scholar with a degree in mythology would know), but I do know that Odin, Kali, Venus, and quite a few others play pivotal roles in Shadow's development and rise.  And how does he come into this role?  Well the book will have to tell you that.  It's fun, it's a bit long, but worth your reading time.  I'd give it an A-.	2001-12-21

Anybody who's read the in depth novels of Frank Herbert will understand my enthusiasm directed toward this book.  Frank Herbert could get a little....well...overly philosophical at times.  This caused quite a few within his fandom to sigh and/or scratch our heads and say, &quot;I wonder what he means by that?&quot;  But here, in 'Eye,' we get to see the short version of his ample mind....<br />'Eye' is a collection of short stories by Frank Herbert.  Since Mr. Herbert's genre has almost always been Science Fiction, these stories are also.  And to top off this wonderful collection, it's been illustrated (on the cover and with sketches inside) by Jim Burns, a world renowned British artist.  The cover alone makes it worth your while to buy, as does Mr. Burns explanation in the back of the book as to why he chose this subject material in this color scheme.  The 'Walking Tour of Arrakis' with its multiple sketches and descriptions were outstandingly and tastefully done.<br />But let's get to the meat-and-potatos of this book: Frank's mind.  It starts out with Mr. Herbert's feelings about the making of the movie, Dune.  Most insightful.  Then we quickly move on to 'Rat Race,' a 25 page short story about first contact with aliens on earth and how that might come about.  And how these aliens might perceive us.  Freaky!  Then we move on to a short version of 'Dragon in the Sea,' which actually became a novel and a series.  The interesting part of this story is it shows Mr. Herbert's past experiences within the Navy.  Then on to 'Cease Fire' which was undoubtedly my favorite story and only 19 pages long.  Here Mr. Herbert shows us what he's famous for: diving into the human pysche and human power struggle from governments but doesn't do it overly-so.  Thank Shai-halud!<br />All the stories are worth mention but I feel I'm already lengthy in my review.  But pick up a copy of this book for your Science Fiction loved one this Xmas season.  They'll love you for it.  And you can ogle at the beautiful artwork.ogle at the beautiful artwork.	2001-11-30

Who wouldn't?  Who couldn't help but ask, &quot;Can I have some of what Mr. Herbert was smoking when he wrote this?&quot;  Far out!<br />The story revolves around the kidnapping of a young boy who happens to be the son of a prominent politician.  He is kidnapped by a Native American living in the California coastal mountains because the 'Indian' has been given a vision by Bee, his spirit creature.  He has to find out whether this boy is worthy of what destiny says the 'Indian' must do.  And what is that I hear you asking?  Well we can't tell you everything now, can we.  But rest assured the ending is well worth the length of the novel itself.<br />I notice that this book is currently unavailable (out of print).  Sad.  Such a good story.  I've also heard rumor that they might be bringing it back into print...but don't tell anyone.  It'll be our little secret, okay?	2001-11-26

Oh my!	&amp;#65279;Carla Knight, an Emergency Room doctor with a specialty<br />in Dive Medicine, is tired in her daily grind. She decides that she needs to take a vacation. Maybe a friend of hers Steve Terzien, a fellow diver and salvage expert in underwater wrecks, might let her come out on his boat for a week-long special.<br /><br />Steve Terzien and his crew aboard the Golddigger are looking for the Isabella, an old shipwreck rumored to have a horde of valuable antiques and gold aboard. But instead they find an old WW II submarine with strange markings. Could those be symbols for biological agents? And radiation?<br /><br />Carla sets out on her vacation only to find that an evil has befallen her friend Steve and his crew.  What happened to them?  Read on as Dr. Knight tries to unravel this mystery.<br /><br />Von Kreitler is an old WW II sub commander who has retired(?) to the Honduran Islands and holds contempt for the U.S.. Is it he who Commanded the sub during WWII? Why would he still be interested in the sub?  The wars been over for years....Or is it?<br />Enter Rod Dalton, an undercover DEA agent, who gets wrapped up in this case because of his surveillance of local drug cartel members. Rod becomes interested in Dr. Carla Knight as she enters the scene. The two make a unique pair: him trying to keep his cover and hide his past from her, and Carla trying to open up to him after not having a relationship with another man since the death of her husband Philip, years ago.<br /><br />Together (and along with Pepe, a small local boy with the desire to help them) they are able to move the story forward and discover the questions to these many unanswered riddles. The book moves along at a steady pace but has a rather simplistic outlook on biological espionage. The characters are not fully developed (except for Dr. Knight) so you tend to have no attachments to any of them (not even little Pepe). Too much foreshadowing ruins any possibility of suspense or surprise, showing that this first time author has room for improvement. But still, I expect that we might see great things from Janet Lord in the future as her writing abilities mature and her stories come to life.irst time author has room for improvement.

Is it an astronaut that started in the space program?  Or perhaps a man that we think of as 'a boy behind the rudder of America's self-esteem?'  If you think you know, then you might be surprised by this book.<br />The story is that of the development of the space program that eventually becomes NASA.  It is told in such a unique style and quasi hum-haw way that it keeps the reader gripping the pages and saying, &quot;Holy Mackin-oly son.  This is tense!&quot;<br />But I bet if an english teacher ever picked up this book they'd cringe (i.e. 'and the pilots soared and came back down to earth in a charred ball and the rest of the pilots brought out their blue dress suits and went to the funeral and sighed.)<br />But hey! This is entertainment...mixed with a some serious history.  So the level of enjoyment for the reader is up there.  I read the book in three days and laughed, cried or did both multiple times.<br />I think what made the book interesting was the fact that it was basically told from the perspective of one of the astronaut's wives.  Basically, but no wholely.<br />And who do you think the true hero is in this story?  Alan Shepard?  Neil Armstrong?  Buzz Aldrin?  How about another astronaut?  Or could it possibly be a man who's never been in space but has directed some of the best pilots in the world and has done incredible feats with those sound busting rockets strapped to his behind.

Many times, local unknowns try to get their stories into a book just so they can say, &quot;Hey look!  I'm a published author!&quot;  But 'author' is NOT what I would call the many previous stories I've read from local 'unknowns.'  However....<br />I'm happy to say that I was surprised --- VERY surprised --- at the quality of stories in this book.  Most can be read in about ten or fifteen minutes.  Almost all of them are well crafted and can send a chill up your spine.  My personal favorite was 'Personals' by McKenzie Moss.  It focused on the relationship of a woman and a man, both of whom have some heavy baggage coming into their 'relationship' (if you can call it that).  It reminded me a bit of Fatal Attraction...but with a twist.  And the story was well rounded.<br />This is not to say that I didn't enjoy any of the others!  Quite the contrary.  The first three stories in the book stand out in my mind, even now.<br />So if you're worried that these stories might not be up to par in the literary world, don't be.  These writers deserve the title of 'author' in my opinion.	2001-11-21

And not just simply control their minds, but make them physically do anything you wanted them to.  What type of person would you be?  Well Mr. Simmons tells us in breathtaking detail.<br />The story revolves around Sal Laski, a Jew who survived the Nazi death camps of WWII.  He came into contact with one of these Mind Vampires (as we come to know them) that he nick-names 'The Oberst.'  Having his mind touched and his body controlled is worse than being 'raped.'  And Mr. Simmons shows us exactly how that would feel.  Chillingly!  Mr. Laski becomes fanatical about finding his Oberst and giving him back what Sal had felt all those many years ago during the War.<br />Mrs. Melanie Fuller is a Mind Vampire also, and she and a few of the others with the Ability meet every year to discuss their scores (i.e. how many people they controlled and killed and how much publicity it got).  They are so nonchalant about their controls and killings that it is almost maddening to the reader.  They have absolutely no empathy for anyone or anything which makes them all the more horrific.  Amazingly, the reader eventually becomes comfortable with these characters and wants to know if they will survive their own failings in humanity.  Terrific stuff!<br />Mr. Harod is a slime-bag producer of B-movies Hollywood who also has the Ability.  He uses it to control women specifically and solely (because he feels that touching a man's mind would be to homophobic for him).<br />Mr. C. Barent is a billionaire with the Ability who owns a mythical Island off the coast of Florida.  Once a year 'The Island Club' meets and plays a game: they bring lost souls to the island and Use them to kill one another.  The last Mind Vampire with a player still alive at the end of the week wins. (spoiler)<br />Incredible as it may seem, Mr. Simmons has the ability to write in many different genres...and capably so.  He received a Hugo award for Science Fiction for his Hyperion novel.  And received the Bram Stoker Award for Horror for this one.  Truly fantastic.<br />An incredible novel and quite lengthy.

His assistant, Count Fenring, is devilishly clever as he manipulates the Emperor and thus is basically the power behind the thrown.  Of course, the spice wars don't go exactly as planned since the Emperor's project Amal (a synthetic form of spice) falls apart...in part thanks to Duke Leto Atreides.<br />Liet becomes the Naib of all the sietches on Dune and helps further humiliate the opposing Harkonnens on the planet.  The ending Fremen chapter in the book is exceptionally prophetic since those who've read the original Dune novel (by Frank Herbert) know the reason why the worms act the way they do toward the end of this novel (House Corrino).<br />The Bene Geserit continue on in their quest for the Kwizatz Haderach but get thrown a curve when Jessica delivers Paul, a son, rather than a daughter that their breeding program requires.<br />Duke Leto, Prince Rhombur, Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho mount an offensive to take back the world of Ix for the renegade Vernius family, thus aiding in the destruction of project Amal (which was taking place on Ix) and saving Dune from destruction by Imperial forces (the Emperor planned to attack and Char Dune to a crisp so that he would have the only form of spice:  Amal).<br />There are weaknesses in the story, however.  Most notably is the introduction and demise of Mephistis Cru, an 'etiquette' advisor for the Baron Harkonnen who's storyline does not advance the history of Dune in the slightest (or any of the parallel stories as far as I can tell).<br />The entrance of Rhombur into a navigators enclosure.  From my understanding, no one was allowed to see a navigator except those who are within the guild itself.<br />And the discovery of the Atoxl tanks by the invading Atreides forces and others (including Fenring) who'd seen the tanks.  According to Dune, no one ever saw these tanks or a Tleilaxu female...ever! Except for the Tleilaxu specialists themselves.  This seemed inconsistent with Frank Herbert's vision.<br />But even with these problems, the book moves along at a good clip (sometimes overly simplistically so for a Dune book).  From about page 300 on I was thoroughly engrossed in the novel and had trouble putting it down (I have the British version which is typeset differently than the American hardback).<br />A fun jaunt through the Dune universe for those out there with an interest in Science Fiction and those fascinated by the history of the Dune characters that Frank Herbert conjured up out of his incredible mind.

But because it was simply hard to get through.  It was such a poorly characterized novel that I had to put the book down many times and just sigh at the amateurishness of it.  This surprised me greatly since many of Mr. King's previous works were excellently done (It for example). But Dreamcatcher was poorly developed and insulting in many ways.<br />Most notably we never really get inside the characters heads (except for Jonesy and Mr. Gray).  But we never understand motivation or come to care about any of these people.  When they die (which many do), I just had to say, &quot;yeah, he died.  So what?&quot;<br />I also think that Mr. King is running out of original ideas.  He seems to be stealing his own works from the past and trying (in vain) to reinvent them.  I saw a Twilight Zone mini-movie years ago in which Mr. King himself starred.  He played a back-country hick who had a large meteor land in his backyard.  When he touched it, he got this red-orange fungus on him that grew and grew and eventually took over his entire body before he killed himself.  Sounds way too familiar to be mere coincidence.  Also, if you've ever read or watched 'The Stand' you'll remember the lovable but retarded man that everyone likes (&quot;M-O-O-N that spells moon.&quot;) and Mr. King seems to have tried to reinvent that character in Dreamcatcher as well in the form of another retarded but gifted man/boy named Duddits.<br />But of all the problems that I had with this book, my largest concern was the use of insulting biogtry.  Although the comments that Mr. King used came from the mouths of characters, since these characters were so poorly developed it didn't seem natural and only sounded prejudicial.  Although I must admit that he left no culuture, ethnic group, or religion out in the telling.  He equally insults the Irish along with the African Americans and all the way up and down the social ladder.  Disconcerting.<br />The story: Surrounds the lives of four friends who develop psychic abilities of varying degrees once they come into contact with Duddits, a mentally retarded boy whom they save from some bullies during their high-school years.  Jump to the future and aliens have sent a blight to earth to take over and wipe out humanity.  Jonesy, one of the four boys now grown into a man, is their Typhoid Mary, but he is also able to fight against the encroaching mind of Mr. Gray, a being who has taken over his body.  This irks Mr. Gray but he continues on his task to try and infect as many humans as he can.  The scenes jump back and forth between the Jonesy/Mr. Gray character, to the Military trying to cover up the exposure, to Duddits and the rest of Jonesy's friends (who mostly die in unattractive yet boring ways).  Thanks to Duddit's powers, Jonesy is able to drive Mr. Gray from his body and help stop the infectious route toward humanity.<br />So why two stars?  Easy.  The book is plotted well, almost too well, and there are some interesting sections with comical quotes.  But mostly this book is simply insulting and completely unappealing.  Boring.

Enough to cause the edges to fray and the binding to bend in unnatural ways, that's for sure.  And why would someone, anyone, want to read a book over and over again?  It's hard to put into words, but I'll try:<br />This is probably the ultimate fantasy novel in literary history.  It is equally fun, entertaining and learned for the reader.  Since Master Tolkien wrote this book over fifty years ago, it just goes to show us that some stories were meant to last forever.  This is one of those.<br />The story is the continuation of 'The Hobbit' --- the story of Mr. Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo has adopted his nephew, Frodo, and gives him all his worldly possessions...including The One Ring, The Ruling Ring.  It is this Ring, in the possession of Frodo the Ring Bearer, that causes the ultimate downfall of Middle Earth.  It is evil and was forged by Sauron on Mount Doom in the cracks of fire.  It is the One Ring that rules all the other magical rings of Middle Earth, and if Sauron gets it, darkness will envelop all.  So it must be destroyed, and Frodo is given the task of taking it to Mount Doom (where it was forged) and throwing it into the Fire, thus diminishing all the other Rings of Power, but saving Middle Earth from eternal darkness.<br />The battles are daring and brave as are the characters: Boromir, Aragon, Samwise, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf (Mithrandeer), Treebeard, and many, many others.  Of course, we also can't forget Gollum (also known as Smeagol).  He is the unwitting player in the book that serves a purpose that he cannot and could not comprehend.

And what a finish!  Caesar(Let the Dice Fly) was an excellently done fictionalization of one of the most brilliant strategists in the history of the world.<br />This book, compared to the previous four in the series, moves along at incredible speed.  Caesar's cunning and abilities never ceased to amaze me.  Out-numbered (often four to one or worse) he succeeds by using his agile mind for tactics and wipes away all opposition in front of him.  This included Pompei and the Senate in Rome (who were trying to steal his dignitas).  The incredible amount of research done by Mrs. McCollough shines through and she gives us some insights into her understandings of Caesar and Rome at the end in her Afterword; some interesting reading in its own right.<br />I particularly liked the hobbling of Pompei by the Senate bureaucrats.  He wanted to starve and wait Caesar out, something that might have worked.  But the Senate wouldn't hear of that!  They all but ORDER Pompei to attack Caesar, the Senate men having no to little understanding of what Caesar is capable of.  Of course, Caesar wins (as history tells us) in his usual stunning way (out-numbered three to one).  And Pompei and the Senate continue their exile until Pompei is betrayed in Egypt and beheaded.  This is where the story leaves us.  Mrs. McCollough notes in her Afterword that her next book will be entitled 'The October Horse.'  I'm hoping that will come out soon.  She's already written and published another historical novel, though: Morgan's Run.  I hope she hasn't given up on this series!	2001-08-23

Caesar's Women is a marvel of research from this author.  Fictionalizing it must have been very difficult...but then again, how could it not be.  But reading it one feels like the author was the proverbial fly on the wall over 2,000 years ago.  Amazing!<br />Caesar's Women focuses on the powerful roles that the ladies during Caesar's rise played in the formation of things to come.  Aurelia (his mother) is undoubtedly the strongest of these, as is Servilia (Brutus' mother and Caesar's lusty wanted and dangerous woman).  Julia, Caesar's daughter, plays a pivotal role as she is swept away from Brutus --- whom she was betrothed to --- and then given to Pompey (who is as happy as a clam since he sees her as a goddess figure and a way into the Julii line).  My only problem with this portion of the story was that Pompey fell head over heels for Julia but never seems to see the political significance of it (for the Caesars).  Pompey is a very powerful man with much dignitas and wealth.  Surely he must have noticed how quickly Caesar agreed to break Julia's betrothal to Brutus and give her to him.  But there is no mention of this, and the story only tells us how in love the two became.  Pompey wasn't a fool.<br />That being said, I think Caesar's Women is a triumph for the history of the women of that time.  They are always seen as insignificant to the arena and times, since men dominated.  But Mrs. McCollough shows us the back rooms behind the Senate and the Plebian Assembly.  Women were pivotal.  And Caesar's Women doubly so.  Extremely intriguing.<br />Of course, now it's on to Caesar --- the last book in the series thus far (at least to my knowledge).  The build up of Clodius, Brutus, and Cato leaves a tingling in one's spine as you realize what is to come.  The dagger!  Oh god...where is that next book!  I've got to start now!	2001-08-07

At first I felt a little uncomfortable reading it, but I soon got into its style and the book whisked by without further problems (it took me about three chapters to finally get comfortable with this writing format).<br />Considering that this was a self-publish venture, I was pretty impressed.  Mr. Mirsky tells the story well, the action scenes are handled excellently, and the individuals who are paramount in the story are vivid with their own personalities that you become comfortable with (my favorite was Arnliot --- the giant Greenlander with serious attitude).  I have seen large publishing house books (i.e. Berkeley, Bantam, etc.) that are much worse than this in style and characterization, so I was pretty pleased when I'd finished Mr. Mirsky's book.<br />I think that this book could be a very good book, but is currently only a 'good' novel.  If Mr. Mirsky could find some editor at a large publishing house to take him under his wings, I think that this book would be a good seller for that company.<br />There were areas of concern to me while I was reading.  Most notably there were twentieth and twenty-first century terminologies used (albeit infrequently --- I think I may have counted less than eight of these, and I can't recall exactly what words these were at the moment)at some points.  This took me out of the story and threw me back into 'my time,' rather than keeping me in the Norse Legend some 1100 years earlier.<br />The story, for the most part, focuses on the character Sigtrygg and his claim to the lands of Vinland (East coast of North America) and his tumultuous life struggles as he tries to overcome his family's desire to see him removed from their lives and property.  He is the proverbial thorn in their side.  Amazing escapes, encounters with Skraelings (Native Americans), and finally re-encountering his kin when they try to forceably take back Vinland for their own, rounds out the story.<br />The story moved you along well --- mostly --- and ends extremely well (probably my favorite part of the book).<br />My only other criticism would be that Mr. Mirsky needed to include a map somewhere in the book to show Sigtrygg's travels (some sort of ancient map reproduction would have been great!).  But my hat is off to you Mr. Mirsky.  Send a few books out to publishers.  I wouldn't be surprised if you get a few bites.  Well done.ds out the story.  <br />The story moved you along well --- mostly --- and ends extremely well (probably my favorite part of the book).  <br />My only other criticism would be that Mr. Mirsky needed to include a map somewhere in the book to show Sigtrygg's travels (some sort of ancient map reproduction would have been great!).

Quite the contrary, Mr. Simmons is an excellent author --- I could only dream of being half the writer he is.  But Mr. Simmons needs some help with endings.  Now don't jump on me for criticizing this portion of his writing style, but I'm becoming a little concerned (perturbed maybe?) with the way he ends his novels.  I started with Hyperion --- which was an absolutely awesome story --- and 'graduated' through that series.  Now I've finished Song of Kali and noted the same problems.  His endings....well...stink.  Sorry, but there's no other way to put it.  But let's move on....<br />Song of Kali is the story of Mr. Robert Luczak and his discovery of evil incarnate growing within Calcutta.  The story is basically about loss in the extreme, but retaining one's vision of why we continue on even in the face of overwhelming and insurmountable obstacles.  Mr. Luczak initially goes to India on assignment for Harper's Magazine to find out if a famous Poet ---M. Das --- is still alive after years of no one seeing him and being presumed 'dead.'  A Poet manuscript has been discovered that fits the writing style of M. Das and Mr. Luczak has to find out the truth as to its origins.  He soon falls into the cracks of the black background of Calcutta and discovers death and dismay at every corner.  The descriptions of Calcutta are vivid and depressing (just as they should be coming from Mr. Simmons).  Mr. Luczak soon learns that this isn't the place to be but seems helpless to leave or get his family to safety.  Driven forward by his desire to 'finish his assignment' he is forced into a soul and death struggle once he encounters The Song Of Kali.<br />But even after his return to America (minus a family member --- but I won't tell you who) he seems embittered and lost.  His soul is fighting between light and darkness and he is forced to return to Calcutta by the Song.  But he can't obey the Song of Kali and forces himself back again to America where he settles down once again.  But to what end?  The blackhole of Calcutta remains and will it devour the world of light?  It appears that only Mr. Simmons know this.  Frustrating.<br />Okay, but would I recommend this book.  Definitely.  Mr. Simmons is a master-storyteller...at least up til the end.  This is good literature, however.d forces himself back again to America where he settles down once again.  But to what end?

It has a huge (and I do mean HUGE) build up<br />from the beginning of the novel until about fifty pages from the end<br />when Herbert dumps the proverbial soup into our laps.  But there are<br />many questions left unanswered at the end (not that all questions<br />SHOULD be answered but I felt that a sequel was sure to come had Frank<br />Herbert not passed away before he could finish the series).  I've<br />heard that Brian Herbert, Frank's son, discovered a seventh Dune<br />manuscript in a safety deposit box after his father died.  If this is<br />true, I can't wait to see it in print.  If it's not true, then we may<br />never know what the 'master' had in mind.<br />But enough of<br />that...onto the book itself!<br />The story is that of the Bene Geserit<br />sisterhood and their war against the wicked 'Honored Matres' who've<br />returned from the scattering and has threatened to wipe out all of the<br />BG sisterhood.  Meanwhile, the BG's are turning Chapterhouse --- their<br />last sisterhood stronghold planet --- into a desert planet and<br />bringing back the worms of Dune to this planet in hopes of starting a<br />new cycle of sandtrout/worm/spice/sandtrout, again.  Strong in this<br />story is that of Duncan Idaho and Murbella, the captured Honored Matre<br />from the fifth Dune book.  They are [multiplying] like rabbits still in<br />their no-ship prison and the BG sisterhood takes away the babies<br />hoping to find genetic markers that they haven't seen before<br />(continuing on in their quest for a perfect human).  Also at the<br />forefront is that of Odrade, the Mother Superior of the BG, who sees<br />where their paths with the Honored Matres must lead.  It is a giant<br />melting pot that began with Leto II's rule (the God Emperor or the<br />Tyrant if you prefer).  The BG and the Honored Matres must become one<br />sisterhood for them both to survive.  Odrade sees this and passes her<br />sisterhoods internal lifetimes on to Murbella after completing her<br />training and watching her go through the spice agony.<br />In the end,<br />the melting pot is achieved thanks to Odrade's manipulations and<br />Murbella's Honored Matre's training.

Boy Mr. Simmons, you sure can get long winded at times.  I think that this book could have been about 200 pages shorter than it's current 709.  But I AM glad that some artist finally got the Shrike correctly represented on the cover (IT HAS 4 ARMS....YEAH!).<br />But enough of that.  Now onto the book!<br />The story picks up exactly where Endymion left us hanging.  Raul is still in his 'Cat Box' waiting for death, writing his memoirs on vellum and feeding the recycled paper into the computer.  He tells us about Aenea and her life surrounded by these wonderful people (A. Bettik the Android, Martin Silenus the old poet with a mouthful of obscenities, Father-Captain de Soya, the Nemes things, and, of course, the Core with it's Lions and Tigers and Bears).<br />Humanity is on the verge of stagnation thanks to the evil portions of the Core who utilize the Cruciform as a parasite upon the bodies of humans.  It is a feeding parasite that allows the Core entities to harness a lot of power and walk amongst the human race.  Aenea knows this and is out to stop the stagnation and end the rule of the Pax Church (that requires it's members to wear the resurrecting Cruciform).  She also wants to bring back Old Earth to it's rightful place in the Sol system, and unite humanity in a way that was never thought possible.  Through the Void Which Binds, Aenea achieves her goal, switching back and forth through time using her soon to be not-so-unique powers that enable her to travel anywhere in the universe where her love, or those who love her, have been.<br />And throughout this entire journey, there is Raul Endymion, writing the story of Aenea and her life.  But he's really writing the Cantos, unbeknownst to himself but revealed later by Martin Silenus (I'm not really giving that much away here, there is much more to this book than just this particular line of plot).  What Raul finally realizes, after he finishes his 'memoirs' is that life cannot be lived in an enclosed egg and he now has the ability to leave after finishing his story.  He just needed the insight and now he has it, thanks to Aenea, Martin Silenus, the Pax, the Ousters, A.

Bettik.  The story is told by Raul many years later while in an orbiting prison cell.  He's writing his memoirs and telling the story from his perspective but with a twist, because he can see things other than what has happened to him...for reasons as not yet clear.  Raul is assigned to make good the escape of Aenea as she steps through one of the Time Tombs on Hyperion, and whisk her away to safety before the evil Pax/Church can capture her.  He is employed by Martin Silenus, the old poet from the original Hyperion novel who is still alive thanks to cryo-sleep.  Before Raul leaves the presence of Martin, A. Bettik, the android, chooses to come along and help.  Raul is happy to have someone, anyone, along since the job seems like a suicide mission.  But through miraculous circumstances he is able to secure Aenea away from the evil Pax/Church, thanks to the sudden reappearance of the Shrike.  Now that Raul has secured Aenea he, the android and Aenea go on a wonderful jaunt/escape through the portals (which have been deactivated since the Fall).  Aenea seems to be able to activate the Portals and they quickly make daring escapes before being caught or destroyed many times.  Most notably in this book are the comparisons between its storyline with 'The Wizard of Oz.'  There are Lions and Tigers and Bears (within the TechnoCore---which was thought to be destroyed during the Fall), the melting of the wicked witch, Nemes, who was sent to kill Aenea (I could hear her screaming, &quot;Help me, I'm melting!&quot; as the incident occurred).  But behind all of this is the never-ending story of good vs. evil, stagnation vs. evolution, and man vs. machine.<br />  Now its on to The Rise of Endymion.  Read on Sci-Fi fans!	2001-03-05

The best thing about Mr. Bryson's stories are the voice in which he tells them.  He is witty, a good researcher, and a lover of travel.  Which is why most readers who loved his 'A Walk In The Woods&quot; book, will love this one as well.<br />The book takes you through Mr. Bryson's journey(s) through Australia (as if you couldn't tell that from the cover).  His description of the country in phenomenal.  Obviously, Sydney and Perth are cities to be visited should I ever choose to go to the 'land down under.'  They are beautiful and unique in their own special ways and this author helps us see them (from multiple standpoints: agricultural, wilderness settings, political, and population).<br />Traveling through the outback seemed a bit dangerous to me.  When Mr. Bryson set out in his four wheel drive (which he explains the function of in hilarious detail), it seems a bit foolish.  But the hijinks are well deserved as the travel continues.<br />Of course swimming takes a certain amount of skill, and bravery, in Australia.  The box jellyfish sounds like a small monster and the number of shark attacks are disquieting to say the least.  Mr. Bryson's experience with boogy boarding is an absolute joy to read and I'm sure that it took him many days to recover from the wounds to his body and pride.<br />All in all, this is a very well written non-fiction novel with just the right amount of information, comedy, and caring that such a country as Australia deserves.	2001-02-21

He is witty, intelligent, knowlegdeable, and easily read, all at the same time.<br />The book (non-fiction and usually found in a travel section of a book store) centers around the existence of the appalachian trail in the eastern U.S..  After spending years away from America, in the boorish land of the Brits, Bill discovers the trail and decides to hike it from end to end.  Initially he has trouble finding someone willing to go on this extended hike with him, but then an old school chum, Steven Katz, calls up and decides to join him.  The two are a rumbling, bumbling, out of shape and disjointed pair that have you chuckling many times as you read on.  Hiking the trail isn't an easy thing to do with your life on your back, or so they soon discover.  But they plod along and along the way the reader gets some interesting history behind the trails establishment, the people they meet along it's course, the states that they amble through, and the general decay of their minds as they begin to see nothing but mile upon mile upon mile upon mile of trail ahead of them.<br />Did they hike the appalachian trail though?  That is a question that each reader will have to answer for themselves.  I think they did.  I've hiked many miles in Alaska and I know what it's like to be on trails like that.  They hiked it!

How ever you look at this book, it is all those things and more.  Most notable is the endurance that this book has, lasting over sixty years and still a favorite of millions, perhaps billions.<br />The story is that of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit.  Hobbits are peaceful creatures who live in and around Hobbiton.  One day, Bilbo is approached by Gandalf, a wizened wizard who sees Bilbo as a necessary force for the gathering of a party of dwarves bent on revenge and getting back gold stolen from them by Smoag, a nasty dragon.  In the midst of this party and all that they encounter upon their journey to the Lonely Mountain (where the treasure of Smoag and Smoag himself lay) they encounter other forces, strange creatures -- some friendly and some very unfriendly.  Deadly spiders, Trolls, Goblins, Wolves round out the deadly enemies.  Elves, Men, Elrond half-Elvin, Byorn, and dwarves, round out the good guys.  And of course, we can't forget Gollum...the dispicable creature within the Misty Mountains whom Bilbo encounters and gains the ultimate power over the lands....the RING!  A magic ring that renders it's wearer invisible, but also takes part of the person away (as you learn in later books).  But the Ring is mainly a sideline to the main story which is the success of good against evil thanks to a little, nothing of a Hobbit.  Even the smallest of creatures can have a monumental impact, is what Mr. Tolkien was trying to tell us I think.  That, and don't judge a book by it's cover.<br />Enjoyable in everyway and a book to pass on to your children and their children.  Please read it!  It will change you, just as it changed the lands before humankind.	2001-02-12

And Prelude to Foundation is actually the first book in the series ---time-wise --- but the last one written.  Which made it exquisitely sweet to me.  I absolutely loved it (except for the cover which was a serious turn off and looked cartoon-ish).  The domed world, the chase scenes, the action behind how the foundation would come into existence, all made this world real and intriguing.  I absolutely loved it!

This helps add to the flavor and makes the reader care about the novel as a whole.  Dune does it (by all accounts the masterpiece by which all other Sci Fi novels should be gauged in my book), Hyperion does it (hugely!) and now, so does Ender's Game.<br />The story revolves around the life of a young boy named Ender Wiggin; he's basically been inducted into the military without his knowing it (sounds kinda scary...and familiar!).  His life, as it turns out, has been set---in the stars so to speak.  The military, seeing his genious (spelling?), exploit his gift for strategy at every turn.  And the most amazing thing, is that Ender knows it!  He's not smart and oblivious to what's going on!  Come on!  But it isn't the fact that he HAS to do what the brass wants.  It's that, if he doesn't, mankind MIGHT be exterminated from the universe (or at least from earth).  The final 'game' that Ender plays....well....you'll just have to read it, because I don't want to spoil it ALL for you.  But I will tell you that you must go on and read Xenocide after this one.  If you don't, you lose the perspective that Ender had at the end of this book.  The remainder of the series is questionable, but these first two novels are top-notch.	2001-02-07

God Emperor Dune is a remarkable novel in that it twists plots into one melting pot designed by Leto II (the God Emperor).  His Golden Path will not be denied and Leto knows what he must endure to ensure that humanity does not vanish from the galaxy.  Duncan Idaho makes a remarkable return as does the Atreides blood line that Leto II has been manipulating for more than 3000 years.  It is this manipulation that allows the Golden Path to continue and bring about certain traits that Leto II knows must thrive in order for humans to continue to exist.  It is a startling realization in the extreme, when Leto II decides to take a wife and realizes that his Golden Path will be achieved before his wedding.  What a concept!  Excellent novel.  Also, this novel REQUIRES that you continue on to Heretics of Dune.  I can't wait to read that....again!	2001-01-24

He's been bred and trained that way...and to save humanity.  But he doesn't know this, nor does the reader; at least not completely.  The ending is an awesome spectacle to behold after following Ender's development throughout his young life.  <br />Five stars and no less for this great novel.  Mr. Card is obviously a master storyteller along the same lines as Dan Simmons, Frank Herbert and Isaac Asimov.  Enjoy!	2001-01-21

Although not quite as engrossing as the original, this sequel is well worth your reading time.  The problem may be getting past the first 160 pages or so.  I was rather bored with it all and Mr. Simmons gave repetitive information that he'd already shared in the original.  But then (after page 160) the book shifted into high gear and kept you there till the very end.  It definitely ended better than the first novel.	2001-01-12

But I was pleasantly surprised by this novel.  The book tells so much with so little that it is truly mind-boggling.  Depth of character, the planet and the plots within plots kept me riveted to the pages.  Now its on to the next book in the series.  Enjoy!	2001-01-02

This book is a MUST read for all authors or would-be authors out there.  I nearly soiled my bed, I laughed so hard and so much.  Anne Lamott has a unique writing style that jumps off the page and smacks the reader in the face.<br />I guess that the reason I found it so entertaining was the fact that I could relate (REALLY RELATE) to everything she was saying about being an author.  It is tough, being a writer.  The distractions (both external and --- most hilariously--- internal) are difficult to deal with.  Anne Lamott takes those problems and puts them in a very appropriate context for the authors out there.  I have it on my desk in a place of reverence.  It is my writing bible now.  Thank you, Anne.	2000-12-27

It had lengthy internal dialogue and long explanations of twisted plots within plots.  But Children of Dune ranks right up there with the original Dune in my book!  What a great story!  The twins are awesome in their mental scope and abilities; Leto II is necessarily brutal as his human-ness slips away from him (and he knows it).  The sand trout, the worms fears, the destruction of Alia and her abomination within, all warped the readers mind enough to make this a VERY enjoyable read.  Now it's on to God Emperor of Dune.

Although I haven't 'reviewed' his other works here on Amazon.com, I have read other Crichton books.  My problem that I am having is that Mr. Crichton is falling into the 'hollywood trap' as I like to call it.  He has written screenplays in the past and here is where the trap door has opened for him.  This book reads like a screenplay.  When I finished reading it I asked myself, &quot;so when is the movie gunna come out?&quot;  Undoubtedly Mr. Crichton has already written a template for the screenplay, as this book shows.<br />But enough about the negative aspects of the book.  Let me tell you what I DID like.  The science was good....not great....but good.  The foam, the development of the machine for time travel, all were good working forms of things that didn't suspend belief (too much).  The characters were believable but some of the situations they were put in, were not (fighting a master swordsman in France during this century would have definitely ended in the death of the 20th century traveler...no matter how much training you THINK you have.).<br />Try older Crichton books for some real fun with reading (reading without looking toward the movies).	2000-12-27

My girlfriend had read it and then said, &quot;you have to read this book.&quot;  I trust her judgement so I cautiously opened up the book and began to read.  Am I glad I did.  It is a remarkably well rounded novel with characters that are EXTREMELY well developed.  You come to care about the main people in the novel very much.  It delves into pre-world war II Japan and continues on to present day.  I absolutely loved the story.  Expectations while I read were not left in the void, like some novelists tend to do.  Highly recommended.  It will remain on my bookshelf to be read and re-read by me and mine.  Enjoy!<br />P.S.  This was written by a MAN!  Can you believe that!	2000-12-11

I thoroughly enjoyed the color section in the middle of the book and reading about the director and production of the expensive series.  The DVD that came with it was fun but long winded at times when the interviewees went into what they 'believed' to be Frank Herbert's desires.  But how could they know?  Anyway, a good book for the Dune fan to pick up.	2000-12-10

Thank god it appears that wait is over.  Hyperion is, in a word, awesome.  The tales of the seven pilgrims bound for Hyperion kept me riveted to the pages.  I couldn't put it down!  And that's a rarity for me (I usually read right before bed to help me sleep...but this kept me awake burning the midnight oil).  It is a huge push forward for the science fiction community as a ligitimate genre.  Thank you Mr. Simmons.  I would rank this book right up there with Dune and Lord of The Rings.  Truly magnificent.	2000-12-08

Most notable in the book is the return of Duncan Idaho as a ghola whom becomes a major player in the visions of Paul's future.  The dwarf in the story whom was grown along side Duncan in the Atoxl tanks is an interesting twist in the story and you are actually glad when things turn out the way they do for that little menace.<br />The dialogue is long and complex (a necessity for this type of novel) but kept the storyline moving along at a good clip.  There is no doubt that I will continue to read the series to its finish.  I hope others do the same.  May your water mingle with our water.	2000-12-08

I hate to give a poor review of local writers but my sense of fair literary practice overrides any favoritism I might feel for locals.  Either you have a good book, or you don't.  This is not a very well written book.  The characters are inconsistent in the beginning, their are HUGE gaps in the storyline (why did the woman with cancer up and commit suicide when there were no outward signs of severe depression?) and generally poor story development.  That being said, the locations that the authors speak of are interesting (especially to those of us who know where they are) and that is what tended to shine through, not the characters themselves.  Although I think some will find this book entertaining (especially those within the medical marijuana field and the elderly person who knows that life doesn't end at retirement).	2000-12-02
US	49883642	R6PRRTJUABU83	0345416880	281816523	Enchantment	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Well done novel, but old theme	The thing about reading science fiction and fantasy is that you, as an author, can take the reader to a place never seen or dreamt of before.  Unfortunately, Enchantment doesn't do that.  It hashes over old storylines of sleeping beauty and Baba Yaga and simply puts them into a slightly new storyline.  The reading was entertaining and kept me involved in the book till the end.  I enjoy OSC work (his Ender's Game series is undeniably his best work), and this was good, but not great work.  I want to read about things that I couldn't possibly have dreamt of; I want an author to take my mind on a trip that I never thought possible.  That is what OSC has done in the past.  But here, he takes us into old stories and throws a few twists at us.  Sorry, three stars is all I can give it.<br />Try reading Lord Of the Rings series or the Dune series for truly engaging trips into lands not thought possible.  And, of course, read the Ender's Game series and the Foundation series.  These are where the strengths in literature lay.	2000-11-12

I first read it years ago when I was in high school and decided to pick it up and read it again earlier this month.  I forgot how involved with the characters you became.  Creb, Iza, Uba, Broud, all of them stick in your mind and nearly make you cry when something terrible befalls them.<br />Intrigue into the story was added by the authors assumptions that Neanderthal man had genetic memories passed down from generation to generation...something that 'The Others' do not have.  An excellent concept since learning was limited to the past and the future of Neanderthal was limited to food stores and the seasons --- their ultimate demise according to this author.  An excellent concept.<br />I haven't read any of the other books in the series for a number of reasons.  #1 after speaking with multiple readers about them they informed me that the sequels are nothing compared to the original.  A sad statement if its true.  #2 I just don't have the time or inclination to read something that my friends (whom judgements I trust) tell me that it isn't worth my while.  I might pick up and look through the next one in the series.  But maybe not.  I'm still on the see-saw.	2000-11-09

Living in a country where 'instant gratification' is a must has its down-side.  I think that this is where the original Dune had its problems when it first came onto the literary scene as well.  The original Dune was not well received because it delved into the human psyche of people 10,000 years into the future and delt with uncomfortable characters in an incredibly textured universe.  Dune did not receive critical acclaim until years later when a following of people looked it over and said, &quot;hey, this is an outstanding novel.&quot;<br />Do I think that the same will happen with House Harkonnen?  No.  But let me tell you why.  D: HH is a history of characters in the Dune universe written for the current readership that is amongst the populace (not the 1960's populace in which the original came out).  It is speedy, dives us into the history of the original characters, throws plots at us that develop into the original schemes in the Dune novel and does it all for the current 'instant gratification' audience of readers that is out there.<br />Do I recommend Dune: House Harkonnen?  Definitely.  But don't expect Dune.  It's not a 1960's novel, it's a 2000 novel.  Read it from that standpoint and you won't be disappointed.  I guarantee it.	2000-11-09

This book came very close to 5 stars in my book.  Mr. Gaiman is a master-storyteller, as evidenced in this book.  The London subway system, the 'rarely seen' people who blend into the cracks because we choose not to see these people (the poor, outcast, homeless, etc.).<br />The book is full of interesting characters and an excellent twist at the end.  I suspected certain things before I got the end of the novel but was pleasantly surprised by the way the author tweaked my mind.<br />If you are a lover of Fantasy and/or Science Fiction, this book comes highly recommended.	2000-11-07

It was flat, unimaginative, and a complete waste of my time as a science fiction reader/fanatic.  If it weren't for some basic information that led you back to the series I would have given this book one star.

It was raining at my house when I put the book down, an ironic twist I thought.  The only reason that I didn't give this book five stars was because: #1 Dune: House Corrino is due out sometime next year and I don't want to look like I'm trying to bribe anyone into believing that this is the best book they'll ever read.  #2 Frank Herbert is dead and no amount of study, insight or writing can replace his singular vision that was Dune.  But even so, this is a great book.  It is formatted for todays readership (with short chapters and only the vital information needed to keep you reading)and it keeps the characters in the original Dune novels growing into what they will soon become.  <br />Most notably, I would commend these authors for the wonderful job of planting 'seeds' into our minds (some of them answered in this book and others still waiting to be seen).  I enjoyed reading certain sections --- especially those pertaining to Gurney Halleck and House Vernius --- that later came back to smack the reader in the head (&quot;Oh my god!  So that's what happened to Gurney and that's how House Vernius lost Ix&quot;).  <br />I have noted that several 'reviewers' here have commented on the lack of structure in the novel.  I fail to see that.  Quite the contrary I see remarkable structure and can't wait to see where some of this is going.  Some also have said that the writing is 'below par' or simply 'not that good.'  Let us remember that Frank Herbert created this time and place and Brian Herbert has all of his notes.  If anyone knows how and what to write about, it is surely the son of the Great Man.  I have enjoyed reading it and intend to finish off the series as soon as House Corrino comes out.  Then I intend to go back and read the original six Dune novels all over again because, let's face it, you just can't have enough spice in your life!	2000-10-25

Sometimes it boggs down with a little too much overly-structured detail but for the most part I loved learning about the Celts and how they came to view the world.  Obviously, Mike Harris did a lot of research for this novel and that is what shines through here.  There are some personal insights that Harris uses in lieu of traditional beliefs but I found them fresh and challenging.  A good read all in all.	2000-10-24

You come to know them as if they were family.  I enjoyed reading this book years ago, mainly because it seemed more a mainstream novel than science fiction.  It is a good piece of work, worth the time spent reading it (for me, the second time)and I would recommend picking up a copy --- if you can find one.  Brian Herbert should be proud of this work!	2000-10-24

And then, happily, it did. The stories pace picked up and the characters personalities began to meld and come together.  I found some of the plot development a little bit weak, such as the grandmother and Wraith combination at the end (seemed convenient to the story)and that Nest was able to use her powers to help heal the kid in the very end (when all she could do was destroy the feeders throughout the book).  But the book was 'entertaining' and the characters you came to care about (slightly).  I doubt, however, if I'll read the next book in the series.  Just didn't grab me that much.  Not like Dune or Lord of The Rings or Foundation.	2000-10-19

Who designed that foul cover?  It looks like the cover to a cheap romance novel by Danielle Steele!  Please Colleen, if you read this, do NOT  use the same artist again!  Okay?  Whew!  That's off my chest, now I can  move onto what was actually IN the book.  Again, the author does a  wonderful job of diving you into the life that was Rome and being Roman.  The plots are twisted and multi-layered.  Those sections revolving around  Caesar and the women in his life are very intriguing and kept me reading  (no doubt why the next book in the series is entitled &quot;Caesar's  Women&quot;).  I also enjoyed the 'non-Hollywood' version of Spartacus.  It  is very refreshing to read how his rise from obscurity placed him at the  head of a slave army.  Interesting reading for those who aren't upset by  what they 'think they know' through the big screen.  A well done book and I  can't wait to dive into Caesar's Women and then onto Caesar.

Once again, Frank Herbert dives into humanity full force and thrusts the reader into a twisted surrealism that makes you unable to put down the book and continue turning the pages.  This is a dark book with a twist on  genetics.  It is truly amazing to read this book and realize how long ago  Mr. Herbert wrote it!  Anyway, the book focuses on the life of a tormented  scientist after he witnesses the death of his family in a bombing.  His  goal: to destroy humanity since he has no faith in humanity himself  anymore.  An age old story right...WRONG! It is the method in which this  man decides to bring humanity to its knees that is so compelling.  Try a  little Frank Herbert without the Sci-Fi... you might like it!  I know I  did!	2000-06-04

So I picked up TGC and read it.  I must say that Colleen is a fantastic imagist.  She throws you right into Rome with all its  brutality and glory, with no holds barred, teeth bared and mystical  significance combined into one.  I just know that Sulla is going to play a  HUGE role when he comes back from the war in Africa.  I must say that the  death of Gauis Marius should have taken on a deeper meaning, especially for  all the Romans that must have still loved him, even after he'd gone  completely mad.  But still, his life was only a snapshot of what is to  come.  If you liked reading 'The First Man in Rome' you won't be  disappointed here.  She continues on in the same manner, right where she  left off.  All in all, WELL DONE.  Bravio!	2000-06-04

But if you are like me, and love to learn about history, then this book is a must.  Do you want to talk about diving head-long into the Roman society?  Do you  want to talk about the beginning of the rise of the Caesars?  Do you want  to talk about all the gods and their influences on the ancient Romans?  Then pick up this book and read it!  Rome, in all its glory, comes back to  life as you flip through the pages.  The whole idea behind immersing you  into the Roman civilization is astounding; Mrs. McCollough does a FANTASTIC  job!  I almost gave the book 5 stars, but I held back because it is  incredibly long and sometimes overly complex or redundant.  But other than  that, I absolutely loved it!  I am currently reading the next book in the  series: The Grass Crown.  So far, it is also excellent.  Read On!	2000-05-14

My intention when I purchased the book was to find out about ancient agricultural societies and how they viewed the world, how they functioned  as a whole, and what beliefs they held.  Interestingly enough, my interest  changed to actually enjoying the history behind the Druids and the society  in which they were held in such high regard.<br />I enjoyed the book for  several other reasons as well: King made a valid argument as to the  location on the calendar as to where the Celtic year would begin and end.  It is logical, to me at least, that for an agricultural society they would  celebrate in the summer when food was plentiful and the days long; not in  the winter when they were possibly starving and living off of the meager  rations that they could eat from the salting of meat.<br />One of the other  reasons that I liked this book so much was because it dealt with so much of  the Celtic society in such a relatively short novel.  King touches on  religion, roman influence, cultural oversights by previous historians, and  of course the calendar and their alphabet (which takes up a large portion  of the later half of the novel for obvious reasons).<br />As a reviewer I  would recommend this book to anyone interested in Celtic philosophy and  Society who haven't read any or much Celtic history as of yet.  What I got  out of this book was that I wanted to read more about the society; to find  out more about the Druids, the Bards (or Ovates) and their incredible---and  sometimes magical---lives.  Great read.	2000-05-10

To compare every piece of literature to the masterpiece that was Frank Herbert's crowning achievement is ludicrous.  This book stands alone as a great novel.  I can see Frank's hand in it as  well as that of his son, Brian; it is this that kept me reading it.  It was  incredibly well done on the science fiction front (i.e. Frank's touch), as  well as being incredibly humorous (Brian's input into science fiction).  I  loved it when I read &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; many  years ago.  After reading and enjoying &quot;Man of Two Worlds&quot; I went  back and reread &quot;Hitchiker&quot;.  Enjoy this book for what it is  worth, not as a comparitive study to the masterpiece that is Dune.	2000-05-07

Maybe I'm being picky, but I found far too many parallels with  this book to that of the Lord Of The Ring series by JRR Tolkien.  In  Tolkien, Bilbo and Frodo were the Ring-bearers; in this novel, the pig was  the Key-bearer.  And in Tolkien, Gandalf rode a fast horse known as  Shadowfax; in this novel there was an almost identical character with a  very similar name also.  There were several other times while reading it  that I found parallels too close to Tolkien to be merely coincidental.  But  enough about that.  As a whole, the novel was very shallow and predictable.  I didn't find it challenging in the least (as I did when I read the  Tolkien fantasy novels...or others like Neverwhere).  I gave it two stars  for the simple fact that it was easy to follow and I was able to read it  quickly.  But it left me feeling empty.	2000-05-06
US	49883642	R275TI3YY8JP3P	0553110616	737842842	House Atreides (Dune: House Trilogy Book 1)	Books	5	19	28	N	Y	Well read and well placed in the series	I tend to ignore other critiques of novels but I was thoroughly surprised at the uprising on both sides of this book.  I have been a Dune fan since the early 70's.  I have read and re-read everything (and I do mean  everything) that Frank Herbert has ever written and published.  For those  out there who think that this is the first book that Brian has ever written  relating to his Father's work, that is incorrect; he co-authored a book  with his father (before Frank Herbert's death) titled &quot;Man Of Two  Worlds.&quot;  It is a gripping and sometimes hilarious science fiction  novel.  It was during this co-authorship that Brian and Frank began  discussing co-writing the Dune Prequels as well as Dune 7 (as yet  untitled).  Brian Herbert has all of his fathers notes and know precisely  where Frank Herbert wanted to go with the story as well as where the Dune  Universe should begin (which brings us to Dune: House Atreides).  It is  precisely where it should be in the series.  It is accurate in the extreme  as to technology and where the characters in the original Dune Series are  supposed to be.  I have read, and re-read the series and then gone back and  re-read House Atreides.  I find the book exciting and well planned (i.e. I  can see the ground-work for the next two prequels developing).  I hope that  everyone will read this novel first and not read the reviews here  (including mine).  Then come back and see if you agree with what others  have written.  Enjoy.	2000-04-05
