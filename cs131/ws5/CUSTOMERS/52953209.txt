I have read every mystery in this series so far. I keep reading them because I love the setting, etc, and try my best to ignore the lead character. But I can do it no longer. The Bed and Breakfast series makes me feel like I am reading about the Betty Crocker 1950's. Judith's prizewinning husband is truly a jackass, and she simpers and caters to him like a spineless idiot. What good old Joe needs is a boot out the door. Maybe then Judith could be the independant character she showed the potential of being in the first book of the series. Ane Renie! Oh please!

Any normal person would be dancing a  jig to get some distance between them! And this worrying about what Joe  thinks....it's her house, and if he didn't like anything, I'd tell him to  take a hike!! Please!<br />The end to this mystery is so convuluted one would  need a chart to try to figure it out. I've read all the previous novels in  this series, and keep hoping that they will live up to their sister series,  the Alpine novels. Not yet. <br />I've read much worse books, but this one is  certainly no mystery classic.	1999-09-22

This one is more simple than most, with only a novice mystery reader not being able to figure out the situation early on. But still a worthy read.	1999-09-13

Let me start off by saying I prefer a heroine such as Kinsey Milhone or Stephanie Plum, a hard boiled fiesty gal. Lori, the main character of this book, was just too weak and sappy for me. There was no mystery at all, not  really. It was an adult fairy tale, as some other people have mentioned.  But gosh was it sappy. The ending was just too &quot;cute&quot;. I wasn't  left with a warm fuzzy feeling, more like a sicky sweet taste in my mouth.	1999-08-25

She has a wonderful, lively writing style that grabs your attention, and doesn't let go. And I was actually surprised by &quot;whodunit&quot;, which is unusual for me.

I found The Climb very interesting, but the book was a little too self serving for my taste. The late hero of the book seemed to want to build himself up at other's expense. For a more suspenseful tale about the events  of 1996 on Everest, try Into Thin Air.	1999-03-23

Nevada Barr is quite simply one of the best mystery writes today, and Firestorm is no exception. I think this is one of her best works yet. She's funny, gritty, and realistic.

Let me start off by saying mysteries are my favorite types of books, and a good one will keep me up all night. The first half of this book was one of those can't put down thrillers..and then it sank like a rock, ending in a  way that was completely implausable and ridiculous. I hope Cornwell's next  offerings are back up to par.	1998-12-01

I love the Amanda Pepper series, but I could have done without the moralizing in this installment. I love mysteries that transport you to another place for a few hours, not preach about the dangers of casinos, and  the need for women to save more to avoid becoming the bag lady under the  steps on the Boardwalk! Hopefully the author will get back to what she's  best at...mystery minus the soapbox!	1998-11-19
