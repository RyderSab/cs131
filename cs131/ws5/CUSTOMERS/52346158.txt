After Prep you will still wonder whether or not the main character truly enjoyed her time at Ault.	2005-06-29

It also proves that even girls with straight A's can fall into the web of sexually temptation and face the harsh reality of teen preganancy.  In my opinion, this story makes the reader think hard on what is right for the teen mother and her baby. In the beginning I was all for open adoption. But now after reading this book; I truly believe that there should be some limitations.	2004-02-15

By lashing out violently was not the smart way of doing it.

Educational because I was able to learn some basic Greek by way of the story.  And touching because it told the story of a young girl who thought she would find happiness leaving her home and family to realize it was there all along.  Of course living as a peasant Greek wife for two years did give her the strength to be independant.  But she would also realize that culture shock also can lead to heartbreak and deception.  For any young girl who reads \\"The Sailior's Wife\\" take this warning.  Be wary of young, muscle-bound men with thick foreign accents.  Just because they are exotic in your eyes; sometimes they are not the answer to your problems.	2003-11-15

Finding success in her career and her lovelife in California. And later adjusting to the role of legend and icon during the last years of her life.

Unfortunely, even though Geogrge Jacobs made himself out as a devoted employee who did whatever and whenever Mr.S wanted.  I felt personally that he placed himself into situations that he should have not had any business getting into and in the end it cost him his job.

Or, maybe was just another kid going through the motions when your being bounced around and treated like a slave by grownups who lack responsibility.  My only problem with the book was that I wish I could have found out what had happened to the aunt and uncle who adopted her and their daughter who got a better life than Jenny.	2001-11-18

Once by rich land barons in Texas and then Gilda taking Hosanna share of their lotion profits and disappearing.  I believe it was Hosanna's wish that her daughter, Matriece to bring back honor to the Clark family name and get payback from Gilda.	2001-09-10

Whether it was Suzette being forced into it by being a product of slavery. Or her granddaughter Emily who actually falls in love and becomes a &quot;secret wife&quot; to Joseph Billes.  The secret world begins to crumble right after the Civil War and French men are forced by the &quot;Night Riders&quot; to marry white women or face serious consequences if they continue to be colored women. Although dealing with all of the hardship dealing with white men and having their children.  At no time did Suzette, Philomene or Emily ever try to pass for white.

I'm still worried about Yancy Braxton still going through her split-personality lifestyle regarding being a diva. And I'm glad that Basil will be finally deciding on choosing a side instead of flipping back and forth.  But then again, I could be wrong.  That's why I hope that Mr. Harris decides to write a third installment of this wonderful story.

Jane hides the secrets of that violent evening for twelve years when she finally realizes that she has to overcome her fears and her ghosts.  Plain Jane really gives a reader a beautiful tour or rural Louisana and of course Ms. Michaels always has an array of colorful character and their even more colorful dogs.  The one thing I love about Fern Micheals stories is that the main character's dog are the \\"rock of Gilbraltar\\" in their lives. They characters conversations with them as if they were humans themselves.  I would love to see one of Fern Micheal's stories on the small or silver screen because the characters are life-like and readers can really related.  And I'm sure there is a Jane Daniels walking on every college campus right now.	2001-07-24

Col. Thompson in my opinion was pretty much a person with no sense of direction until he is drafted into the army.  There he finds a purpose rather than having to live the robotic lifestyle of that time when men basically got married, had children, got house and waited to retired.  As for the rest of the Thompson family.  I consider them Vietnam Vets as well. From Alycie (Jim's Wife), their daughters and their only son.  They did what they needed to do to survive while Jim was being held prisoner in Vietnam. But nine years is a long time to be away from your family and harder to adjust when you are living in a house filled with strangers.  The only thing I was puzzled about was the ladent homosexuality Jim developed with he returned. I truly felt the he did come this way while being imprisioned. These feelings were very deep rooted and because of the times he was living in; he had to play along (i.e. get married/have children)or face the consquences.	2001-07-19

From time he is caught stealing his records, living in Germany the same time he was in the Army and even being there for the funeral.  I thought it was cute that Orson thought that it was he who brought Priscilla and Elvis together.

Although Moxie had issues dealing with death of her mother and trying to pass on her Afrocentric ways to her daughter, Zadi; it all a bit to much even after everyone began to defy her in beliefs even her best friend, Norma.  But my favorite character was Norma.  Her story was a woman in love with her husband and son when a tragic death hits home sending her little family drifting apart.  It's not until she receives some attention for stranger and some unwanted attention for her &quot;blackmailing&quot; brother-in-law that Norma and her husband can start to look away from the past, start working to prepare the present and move on into the future.
