Included in this book are sketches and drawings showing his designs are centered around sexual, skeletal, \\"slender\\", \\"bloat\\", \\"mechanical screws\\" themes.  At times, I feel the artist is lacking in creativity (Yeah, I know he is a \\"someone\\" in the art world).<br />Even before the section, Gigerotica, there are already pictures of female figures fitted with rubber phallus (pg 48, 49), engaging in sexual union.  Other pages which might be \\"offensive\\" show group sex, oral sex, self-penetration, etc...  Can't help but wonder, \\"Isn't this more of porn that art\\".  I think it goes beyond erotic art.<br />If everything in this book can be called art, then I suppose you can include any photo of people having sex called art as well.	2002-10-16

For example, verse 122 which reads:<br />&quot;The ways of overcoming (limitations), the facets (of pure and total presence), the four forms of ever-fresh awareness of the alikeness (of everything),, which are undisturbed (by negative conditions), are known in this (practice).&quot;<br />The commentary reads:<br />&quot;The four forms of ever-fresh awareness that thoroughly grasp teh fundamental alikeness (that characterizes) the ultimate content of what is and that are are conditioned by any obstacles; the thirty-seven facets of pure and total presence; the ten ways of overcoming (limitations), etc.; and that which is positive for an individual (relatively speaking), as well as all the positive qualities that belong to the level of the ultimate goal, are known quickly through the reflexive flash of knowing that gives awareness it quality, and brought together in the teaching of the true sense of cultivation&quot;.<br />Another point which I would like to point out is that it is better to read the 157 verses, think about them before reading the commentary.  Do not agree with the commentary blindly.<br />Overall, this book provides good information about rDogs-chen philosophy.	2002-09-29

The writer was William Walker Atkinson who was deeply interested in Indian mysticism and yoga.  True that same phrases are hermetic but it is largely mixed with ideas of Indian origin.  He had written a few yoga books under a different name.  This book is a case where an author get some ideas here and there and with the pile of ideas, packaged it into a book and called the whole thing hermetic principles.

It was bad, real bad.  Too much of New Age flavor in the music and also the singer's (yes, sounded more like singing than chanting) control of voice was deplorable.  Read the book... the singer is the author's daughter.  Better get someone who can sing properly... I cannot imagine how anyone can use this CD for meditation purpose.  So bad that I am not going to use the CD ever again.<br />There isn't much info about the mantras either.
