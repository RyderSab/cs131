I'm almost done with it and I'm enjoying the story but I'm definitely not laughing or smiling.  It's a page turner.  It's an interesting story, with a different writing style (very good), but I'm hardly laughing!  <br />In the beginning it was funny, but as the story continues at times I wonder if Sally is dellusional!?  I can totally relate to her anxiety and worries but at the same time the whole God/Satan thing is either mental or serious (either way it's not a very funny topic, especially with drinking and driving, hit and runs, biting off tongues, etc!)<br />Don't get me wrong - this is a great book.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I can't really figure out why it's considered a romantic comedy.  I guess the humor has been lost on me?  Romance (yes a little bit).  Comedy (eeh not so much.)<br />Definitely pick this book up.  It's an interesting page turner - but don't expect tons of laughs, or lol funny.  (At least not from my experience!)	2003-12-27

This book is original and creative in how it plays out.   Jane is a little crazy.  I expected more from Eddie but I was bummed out by his lacking character.  Jane's character seemed depressed before, during, and after Ray - so it was kind of hard to tell?  But otherwise this book is witty and interesting - definitely a fast read.	2003-10-21

When I read the opening paragraph of this book I was sold!  It was like Lucinda knew me personally and I could relate to so much in this book.  So much so that I purchased her 15 week program for anxiety and depression.  It's changed my life!  This book is wonderful but if you suffer from anxiety you will probably need more than a book.  Using her behavioral modification program has changed my life.  No matter what I recommend you check out this book, it will help put things in perspective!	2003-10-02

The ending kept me going and it turned out to be lacking in my opinion.  This is a nice & quick beach read but don't expect too much.  I enjoy the open and sexy style but the storyline could have been better.	2003-07-07

Gracie Snow is a 30-year-old virgin who has spent all of her life caring for the elderly at her parent's nursing home, until a month ago when her mother sold the facility.  This lands Miz Snow in a Hollywood job as a production assistant.  Gracie's job is to get the very reluctant Bobby Tom Denton (ex-NFL Player) on the movie set.  Mr. Denton has other things in mind, but none of which involve movies or Gracie Snow.<br />This story might be one of my favorites by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.  It's every woman's fantasy, or at least mine, to get the sexy hard body professional football player (and he falls in love with you!).  And who better than Gracie Snow as his love interest, she is every NORMAL woman, aside from being a, 30 year old virgin.  Which is far fetched but I can accept it.<br />This story surprised me, I thought with a lead character named Bobby Tom that I would dislike the story, but Bobby Tom was a lovable, flawed, and believable character.  Gracie Snow's character was great in that she was a normal woman getting the pro-athlete, but her character was somewhat lacking at times (mostly towards the end of the story).<br />This story would have been a five star read for me, but the typos nearly killed me.  I know, nit picky, but editing on this book was a nightmare.  From the Bobby Tom Demon (instead of Denton), to Gracie spelled, Grade or Oracle.  There were punctuation errors and words that didn't even exist in there!  But all in all, more great stuff from Ms. Phillips, if you liked This Heart of Mine (which is my favorite by her) then you will love this book if you can stomach the horrible editing.	2003-03-14

The Edge of Town is the first book by Dorothy Garlock that I've read, but it will not be the last.   Set in the 1920's in Fertile, Missouri young Julie Jones cares for her five siblings after her mothers passing four years previous from a flu epidemic.   Julie is feeling her life passing her by, caring for her siblings.  Meanwhile, Evan Johnson, son of the lewd drunkard, Walter, returns home after the war to take care of the family farm.  He was away many years, having lived with his grandparents, then going to war.  Evan is nothing like his horrific father, and when he rescues Julie from his fathers assault you know its true love.<br />Too bad there is something (or rather, someone) evil in Fertile.  There have been brutal (and graphic) series of rapes that coincide with Evan's return.  The townspeople can only assume that it is he, and the only person who stands by his side is Julie.  <br />What I liked...and disliked....<br />The descriptive writing in this book brings the time frame and the characters to life.  You feel yourself slipping in the past, of a youthful sweet love story and all the represents America.  Except for the rape, who wants to think of that?  I know it's a part of the story, but the graphic nature of it, dragged the story down.  But, any other writer couldn't have pulled off two ends of the spectrum, love and brutal hate, so perfectly.  <br />In Short...<br />I will definitely pick up another Dorothy Garlock book, but next time I'll make sure the villain isn't involved with sexually deviant activities, it was a bit much for me.	2003-02-23
