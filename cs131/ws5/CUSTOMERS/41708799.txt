I live in North Carolina and, like Charles (Raney's husband), visit my in-laws every Sunday. I am glad to say that I enjoy my visits and that my wife is more open-minded that Raney, but the experiences are similar and had me laughing out loud and reading portions to friends and family. Edgerton does a fine job building characters and the tension between them. The last page of the book is quite a creative way of resolving some of this built up tension and gives the reader a dual sense of closure and hope for the characters. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are from the South and/or you are a newlywed.	2005-08-01

ADULT REVIEWER	Obviously Hagrid is the character I quoted in my review title. I think the big question of this book in regard to the eventual outcome for the whole series is, what did Snape agree to do? There are many possible answers, and some obvious ones beginning in Chapter 2, but I think after we read Book 7, we will be surprised to find out Snape's true nature. Book 6 is certainly one of the best of the series, my second favorite after Book 3. For all the zealots who cry foul about these books, one can read into parts of it some amazing parallels to significant Christian theology (See Luke 22:42 in reference to Chapter 26, \\"The Cave\\".) Rowling also gives us an array of emotions: quite a bit of humor, exhilarating and exasperating love interests, and profound sadness. It's apparent from the way I started this review that Book 6 does a lot to set us up for the end of the series. The final battle is prepared.	2005-07-22

I have always hesitated to read his books or see the movies because I have always assumed that they would be full of slasher, murder scenes. I was pleasantly surprised that this book is more of a psychological thriller. In the 505 page book, there's really not a scary, gory scene until around page 200. King spends the first part of the book brilliantly developing the characters. His writing is stream of conscious, switiching between thoughts of characters mid-sentence. One would think that this would be hard to follow, but that is not the case. I have friends who have said that other Stephen King books are more gory than this one. Despite that fact, his descriptive writing is so addictive, I'm sure I will read more.	2005-07-03

I know that this is going to sound juvenile, and trust me, I am over 13. I couldn't help being bogged down with the archaic language Buck used to tell this otherwise interesting story. I think that the appeal is the insight one gets into pre-Revolutionary China. I dare say many of the customs from the pages of this book still exist in some form. If you want a well told, detailed look into the fascinating culture of China, this book is for you. If you really need fast-paced, contemporary writing, I'd say maybe listen to this one from an Audio book. Sorry to the Buck disciples, but I'm just trying to give my honest impressions.	2005-06-16

Almost to the letter, Dan Brown uses the same formula in both books. There is Langdon, of course, and, just as in Da Vinci Code, at the beginning there is the murder of an intelligent old man by a mysterious assassin presumably hired by a secret society, the victim's alluring and equally intelligent younger female relative, and the eccentric, handicapped old man who seemingly pulls the puppet strings. However, to Mr. Brown's credit, Da Vinci code does not exactly copy this book. I thought I had it figured out but I pleasantly and shockingly discovered that I was wrong. I must confess that I listened to this on CD during my 35 minute drive to work, but I'm sure if I was reading it I could call it a page turner! What is notable, like in The D. Code, Brown deals with more than just secret societies here. He brings in the broader issue of how one reconciles faith and fact. I don't feel that my faith was stretched as much in this book, but it does remind the reader that no matter how holy one is, everyone has needs and desires that sometimes cannot be ignored.	2005-04-10

I could not help but think of it as I read the last 80 pages of The Kite Runner in one sitting so I could discover how it ends. Even though I was enthralled by this powerful story, I was at first apprehensive about reading it when I heard that the book deals with war-torn Afghanistan. I am so glad that I read it. Khaled Hosseini definitely has a second calling as a novelist. His life somewhat mirrors his protagonist's, although Hosseini is a practicing doctor. I certainly hope he considers a sabbatical and gives us more stories like this. Since our church book club is reading The Kite Runner, I kept looking for religious references. Well, one doesn't have to look far. However, this novel is bigger than religion. It taps into the spirituality that binds all religions together. For example, even though Islam is an important unifying theme of the book, Hosseini masterfully illustrates with words the Christian theme of \\"laying down one's life\\" for his friends. According to scripture, there is no greater love. This is another unifying theme of the book: love of country, love of tradition, love of family. And, like any good novelist, Hosseini's picture of life is not the \\"happy little trees\\" version. He shows the bad with the good and many emotions in between. The Kite Runner has earned a place on my \\"Must Reads of a Lifetime\\" list.	2005-03-25

When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement.  Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my \\"must reads of a lifetime\\" list. Put it on yours.	2005-02-23

Saylor has a formula going for these books which works very well. The reader gets an intriguing history lesson and a thrilling mystery at the same time. It's amazing how Mr. Saylor can flesh out these novels from actual events and extant speeches. Of course his fictitious private eye Gordianus enables him to do this. The reader experiences legendary people and events through the eyes of a \\"regular\\" Roman citizen and his family. And family is important. Saylor always seems to find a way to make the mystery have a twist as well as Gordianus' family story. Mysteries are revealed on more than one level, and that's an important mark of a great novel. I can't make myself give the book 5 stars because I reserve those for books that are life-changing. I didn't feel that way about Murder on the Appian Way, but I did highly enjoy it.	2005-02-14

Hiaasen does a fine job of putting together a story, but I found this novel to be just that: a so-so story. It wasn't gripping enough for me. Perhaps I went in with expectations too high. I'm finding that when I read I want to get more out of a book than what I was left with here. I have the same feeling that I had after reading Baldacci's, The Winner. All in all this is an okay \\"light read\\", and I say go for it if you're from south Florida. Otherwise, think twice if you want more than \\"fluff\\".	2005-01-08

Sound familiar? Or what about an ongoing struggle against an evil empire led by an elderly sorcerer as a guide and assisted by a remarkable fighting human, a bearded dwarf who uses an ax, and an elf who is an archer. Ring any bells? All right, before you Eragon disciples lash out, I did like this book. I just couldn't help drawing the obvious parallels to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I suppose Paolini didn't intend the similarities, but even the language he uses sounds so much like what I heard in the LOTR trilogy. The author is obviously brilliant and he tells a good story. And, I suppose one should expect some similarites among all fantasy creature tales. So that's why I still give it 4 stars and say, \\"Good job\\".	2004-08-29

I actually listened to this one on my way to work and back. A good &quot;Science Fiction&quot; book is one that doesn't bowl you over with the science fiction, but uses it as a tool to inform and inspire. Niffenegger accomplishes this masterfully. I am a musician, and I love how she weaves into the story the music of Henry's parents and Clare's visual artistic creations. Also, I have a daughter named Clare and we spell it as Niffenegger did, with no &quot;i&quot;. At its core, this is a love story. Not just the love of a man and a woman, but the lengths one goes to for the love of spouse, children, and friends.	2004-07-31

Haddon worked with autistic children and knows something of their experience. One is amused, frustrated, challenged, and inspired by Christopher's life-coping rituals.

She accomplishes this with such skillfull and poetic use of language, powerful character development, and the right blend of sadness and joy to satisfy the reader in the end. <br />The title itself shows Lee's skill with words. The comparison of more than one character in the book to a mockingbird is touching. This is made poignant when you read Atticus' explanation of the title phrase and the echo of it by his daughter, &quot;Scout&quot;, at the end of the book. Ms. Lee powerfully draws the line of good and evil with her vivid descriptions of the characters in Maycomb. And, just like life, there is not a purely sugary sweet happy ending. However, the ending is richly satisfying and moving.<br />I was never assigned to read this book in high school or college, but I am so glad that I got around to it. Incidentally, the movie is just as good, with an excellent (oscar-winning, I believe) screenplay adaptation.	2004-06-15

However, art is not always supposed to cheer us up. I think that Lowry is the kind of author who really wants the reader to become the storyteller and fill in the blanks. There is no neat package at the end, even in the book which is the third of the trilogy. Matty's true name communicates what I believe to be Lowry's central message. I don't want to spoil the end, so I won't reveal his true name, but the following quote is similarly revealing, and my favorite of the book. \\"So you could meet in the middle with your gifts? It wouldn't be so hard if you only went half way. If you met.\\" Despite the abrupt ending, Messenger is a must read for those who have read The Giver and Gathering Blue.	2004-04-27

The Giver is one of the best books I've ever read. I feel that way about Gathering Blue as well. Lowry has such a wonderful way of using alternate realities to help the reader come to terms with the reality in which we live. My favorite line in Gathering Blue is: \\"We're the ones who fill in the spaces. Maybe we can make it different.\\" This obviously makes it perfect for young adults who need to know that it's ok to feel like they can change the world. As in The Giver, Lowry touches on the the definition of \\"family\\" and finding acceptance with what life deals you without settling. I've just started The Messenger, Lowry's sequel to The Giver and Gathering Blue. I can't wait to see where Lowry will take me next!	2004-04-22

I love it when \\"Young Adult\\" authors can capture any reader by using ageless themes, descriptive writing, and strong characters. Rowling does this well, and now I've discovered Lowry. In The Giver, she explores the pain and pleasure of growing up, expressing TRUE feelings, LIVING life, and the special bond of family. These themes make it perfect for older children around 11 or 12. The protagonist's age is also in this range. However, Lowry speaks to any age reader in this powerful scenario of a future society bereft of choice, variety, and authentic emotions. My wheels were turning all throughout the book as Lowry only gives a bit of information at a time about the Community in which the characters live. But the end of the book really got me thinking and wanting to talk with others who have read it. In my opinion, THAT is the mark of a great book.	2004-04-16

Saylor has a brilliant way of combining history and mystery. Thank you for your hours of research to teach and tingle your reader, Mr. Saylor! It's hard to believe it while you are reading, but you know that the &quot;Author's Note&quot; is coming to basically say that what you have just read is ALL TRUE!! The fictitious world of Gordianus hooks the reader into the shocking reality of ancient Rome. Saylor finds those great historical incidents and skillfully gets Gordianus and family involved. We get a deeper look into the surprising past of another family member in this volume. I only gave 4 stars just because it's not one of those &quot;one of the best books I've ever read&quot; books, but it is certainly worth reading especially for anyone who has begun the Roman Sub Rosa series. Great book!	2004-04-12

Someone recommended this book to me because I said that I was looking for a good fantasy book along the lines of Harry Potter. Although this book deals with fairies, goblins, and trolls, the writing style kept reminding me that it is a \\"Young Adult\\" book. I don't feel that way about Rowling's books. I probably shouldn't be comparing the Fowl series to the Potter series, but, as I said, that comparison was made for me. The magical creatures in Artemis Fowl are made too \\"human\\" for my taste. They have jet packs to fly, modern sounding assault weapons, and use cliches that come straight from Hollywood. I prefer the way Rowling keeps her magical world primitive, traditional, and somewhat naive of the human world around them. There is a good plot structure here with characters that the reader cares about. There is also a sweet twist at the end which is fulfilling. I think it would be a great choice for around 5th-7th graders. However, I can't say that this is a book that I wished would not end.	2004-03-10

I took Latin in high school and we studied the Catilinarian conspiracy. I had to memorize the first part of one of the speeches in the book: &quot;Quo usque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra...&quot;! I love how Saylor brings these great historical figures to life with his descriptive writing. With each novel in the series we also learn more about and grow to like Gordianus and his family. This novel shows artistry of words and intellectual scholarship together. That combination would seem to be hard to pull off, but Saylor does it well. Like other reviewers, I got a little bogged down at times with the intellectual scholarship, but it's not difficult to plug through. It's worth it to experience the action and revelation at the end. I am an even greater fan now and can't wait to start The Venus Throw.	2004-02-04

The vivid descriptions and colloquial dialogue caused me to care about the characters and their outcomes. I also love the way Morgan switches perspective. Some chapters are from the point of view of Muir. He is one of two brothers and the \\"Abel\\" character in a kind of Cain and Abel allegory. Moody is the \\"Cain\\" character, but the book doesn't exactly parallel the bible story. Other chapters are from the point of view of their mother, Ginny. I really felt for Muir and wanted him to succeed. One even begins to root for Moody toward the end. The last chapter concluded and tied together the many journeys the reader takes with the various characters in a poignant and satisfying way. The EPILOGUE, however, ends with a strange twist that was a downer for me. That's why I only gave 4 stars. I was hoping for a different ending, and a little confused by what Morgan wrote on the last few pages. Perhaps what makes it good fiction is that I'm still thinking about it. Our church is using this for a churchwide Book Club. There are many life lessons here concerning work ethic, confidence, being true to yourself and your family, and finding your true calling.	2003-11-12

It reads like one. That's not to say that the book isn't interesting. Starbird's research is presented in a very scholarly and interesting way. It just took me awhile to get through it. I bought this book to fill in the blanks of my own knowledge concerning Mary Magdalen. After reading THE DA VINCI CODE, I had to know more. If you, too, have just read THE DA VINCI CODE, I would suggest starting with HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL. Starbird wrote THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR after reading HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL herself. Don't get me wrong. Starbird's book is extremely interesting and contains a lot of evidence for Mary Magdalen being Christ's lost bride. I just wish I had read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL first.	2003-09-29

But this book is a great read. Saylor keeps you guessing right up until the end. The addition of a sidekick(although he is much more than that) for Gordianus in his adopted son Eco is welcome. This relationship is special and has a sweet turn at the end. I love how Saylor titillates the reader with the stories of Mummius and Olympias and their surprise love interests. The author's exhaustive research is apparent in the intriguing details of classical food, potions, funerals, and other aspects of daily life of different classes of ancient people. The plight of slaves was conveyed with profound sympathy. Having experienced two suspenseful and beautifully written books so far, I will be sure to finish the Roman Sub Rosa series with enthusiam.	2003-08-02

Dan Brown uses a fictional story to reveal some fascinating theories concerning the true meaning of the Holy Grail. I had to continually ask myself if what I was reading was &quot;true&quot;, or fiction. I have a Masters degree in the Arts and have never heard of any of the intriguing notions set forth in this book. If you love word origins, you will love this book. If you love the history behind History, you will love this book. I also liked the short chapters (some only one or two pages long) so that I could stop reading quickly when I had to. The trouble is, I didn't want to stop reading! Christians, you have to be really open-minded. But, I think if you are not too literal a reader of the bible, this book will expand your horizons.	2003-07-18

That sounded intriguing. I must preface my remarks by saying that the book I read before this was the autobiography of Maria von Trapp. Obviously, I had just come from a book that was full of twists and turns, close calls, movement from country to country, etc. What was SO FRUSTRATING about this book is its over-reliance on minutiae. The majority of the book takes place in one room. Toward the end, the characters start to travel to other rooms in the house. I became mildly interested when the plot began to turn on the eventual interaction between the characters. Perhaps I am just not a fan of this genre. Perhaps &quot;magical realism&quot;, as this book has been labeled, is not for me. I have no problem with Patchett's writing ability. The writing is poetic and informed. I just feel that the plot was very flat until a spike at the end followed by an unusual epilogue.	2003-05-22

I was surprised to find that much of the film is accurate. Notable changes/omissions in the film are the children's names, the date of Georg and Maria's marriage, dealings with Hitler and the Nazis, the family's devout religious practices, and the \\"escape\\" from Austria. Much of the book deals with the Trapp family's struggles and triumphs in America. In its Biography of the family, A & E tv implies that Maria paints a rosy picture in this book and glosses over some of the darker chapters in the family's life. I did not find that to be the case. I feel that Maria tells her story, warts and all. You will love learning about Georg's first wife, the true story of leaving Austria, Maria's effort at grasping English, the fascinating religious rituals, and the recurring reality of how music truly saved their lives.	2003-02-14

I don't think that Sedaris set out to write the great American novel here. It's just some funny stories from his life. Who knows if they are exaggerated; but does that matter? I heard Sedaris read from Naked on NPR's &quot;This American Life&quot;. He read the essay about spying on his mom. Very funny stuff!

Rice really did her research and placed the fictional characters in a historically accurate setting. The book deals a lot with singing and the joys and challenges of music.  I really like these aspects and also the vivid descriptions of beautiful sights in Italy.  What you should know about this book is that is contains a lot of homoeroticism.   That element became a little distracting to me.  I will say that I feel that true art should sometimes make us feel a little uncomfortable.  Rice definately delivers the discomfort in this book.  I also felt like there was a long, long set up for the climax of the book which comes at the very end with not a lot of falling action. It took me awhile to get through it.  For me it was not an &quot;I can't put it down&quot; book.	2002-06-08
