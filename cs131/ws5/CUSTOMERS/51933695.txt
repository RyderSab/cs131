US	51933695	R3UCEDNECSZ941	1568495870	511206660	The Population Bomb	Books	1	35	54	N	N	A prototype of catastrophic predictions	Paul Ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do, but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works. He just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world.<br /><br />This book starts with the bold statement that \\"he had understood the population explosion for quite some time\\". Nevertheless, the whole book proves that it's not the case. All his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short-term trend. His assumptions therefore include the \\"intelligent\\" assumption that there won't ever be any technological progress in the future; the climate will evolve in the worst possible way, and so forth. It's not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the U.S. in the 1980s, and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense, he repeated the same prediction for the 1990s.<br /><br />Why does he - and people like him - continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history? It's because of their religion. Maybe they don't call it a \\"religion\\", but it is a religion nevertheless. Jehovah's Witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day. Because it did not occur in 1918 and other years for which it was predicted, they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays. Malthus had done very similar errors as Ehrlich, but you may think that in the 20th century, people could know more than Malthus knew many years ago. But Ehrlich does not know more.<br /><br />In some sense, even Karl Marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions. Marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such, and it would be globally replaced by communism. (This is what I call a truly catastrophic prediction.) Marx was wrong, of course, because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to self-regulate and accomodate to new conditions. Ehrlich is repeating all errors of Marx and many other errors, too.<br /><br />But other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day can't learn from Jehovah's Witnesses mistakes. Of course that Paul Ehrlich's reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions. (Bjorn Lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions - namely these speculative questions about the long-term food problems - rationally.) Ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food; he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more; he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children, and so forth. He just does not understand the \\"invisible hand\\" of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions.<br /><br />His reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past. But it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future. His goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart.<br /><br />The similarity between Ehrlich's predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence. Find the book \\"Boiling Point\\" by Ross Gelbspan at this website - one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us. Among the 15 mostly positive reviews of the book, you will also find a 5-star review by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford himself! The global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of Paul Ehrlich. It is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things: the Universe and human stupidity, and I am not sure about the Universe.ing alarmists continue with the traditions of Paul Ehrlich.

One cannot expect anyone to be much smarter than others. As of today, there is no reliable evidence supporting the existence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. <br /> <br />The so-called Drake equation, proposed in the 1960s to \\"calculate\\" the number of extraterrestrial TV programs that we will be able to watch in the next centuries as a product of roughly ten comparably unknown quantities, became a symbol of a superficially quantitative approach to a question that is untestable and that reflects our faith. A method to write down an equation to pretend that the discussion is serious, without answering any question by the equation. Well, in one of his famous speeches, Michael Crichton has even blamed the Drake equation for the appearance of unprovable catastrophic scenarios such as those found in nuclear winter and global warming hypotheses. <br /> <br />How difficult is it for life to evolve? The authors claim that it is quite easy for primitive life to occur. Primitive life has been observed in extreme circumstances of many types. A scientific approach to the origins of life more or less dictates that the organic molecules can be formed rather generically and the constraints on the temperature and concentration of various elements etc. cannot be too strict. More importantly, we have a pretty convincing observational evidence that the early life should not be so difficult to create: the primitive life on this planet clearly started a relatively short time after the planet was created. <br /> <br />However, the authors say that it is very unlikely for animal life to evolve because the animals require a much more friendly environment. You could say that even the animal life appeared shortly after the birth of the Earth which seems to imply that it should evolve quickly (and therefore likely?), too. And you would be almost right. If it starts to occur, it occurs fast. But thepoint of the authors is not that the evolution of the animal life is very slow: their point is that it may be fast, but if the conditions on the planet are not \\"quite right\\", it won't happen at all (at least this is the expectation). <br /> <br />They enumerate many features of our particular Solar system and our planet - including the composition and brightness of the Sun; its location within our Galaxy; the existence of the Moon that stabilizes the precession of the Earth; various hypothetical collisions in the past that initiated plate tectonics; other requirements for animals to live. It is not rigorously known, of course, how serious these constraints are and whether a slightly different kind of higher life could evolve if some of these conditions were not satisfied. More recently, some exoplanets that would satisfy some of the \\"non-trivial\\" criteria have been found. <br /> <br />However, the authors definitely prove that there exist very reasonable assumptions that may lead to the conclusion that we are probably the unique advanced civilization in our Galaxy if not the whole visible Universe. <br /> <br />You know, these questions are politicized a bit. According to creationists, the life is so precious and overly refined that it could not have appeared spontaneously. Those who want to isolate themselves from the creationists often like to say - and even think - that it must be trivial to create life, and therefore we should be surrounded by aliens. (Fermi asked: Where are they?) That's the opposite extreme which is what others like. <br /> <br />Neither party is supported by observations. It is clearly not hard to create primitive life - but on the other hand, it is not terribly easy to create intelligent, advanced life because otherwise we would have already met the extraterrestrials. The number of civilizations like ours in the Universe may be comparable to one - and it may be exactly one just because we were a bit (or very) lucky. And the \\"coincidences\\" required for life to be created could have been barely enough to produce one Earth that allowed life like ours.  <br /> <br />All these possibilities are open and no solid data are available, which is the main reason I gave the book 4 stars only. But nevertheless, I recommend you this book to see that the guess that \\"we're alone after all\\" is definitely not silly.	2005-04-24
US	51933695	R2XJBB49OG4HII	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	5	13	22	N	N	An important scientific lecture served as a novel	Even though Michael Crichton is an extremely successful novelist, I feel that he is first of all a scientist who has chosen a different career. Despite this choice, he clearly feels passionate about science and the scientific method and I am impressed how well he has understood the general principles of science as well as thousands of detailed scientific questions - as demonstrated in this novel and many others.  <br /> <br />If you read Crichton's speeches available on the Internet, you will see that Crichton's opinions about science are very close to the viewpoints of Richard Feynman, for example. One of Feynman's slogans was \\"never trust the experts\\"; Crichton is also aware of the fact that the so-called \\"consensus science\\" is an extremely pernicious development. Obviously, the people who think that the purpose of science is to promote \\"scientific consensus\\" - as opposed to the search for the truth that may or may not contradict the prejudices of the majority - won't be too happy. <br /> <br />About four years ago, Crichton used to passively believe the statements about the catastrophic global warming - but he decided that it was such an important question that he should try to learn and check the details. With his obvious talents and scientific degrees, it should not be a problem. The more he was looking into the issue - and clearly, he has studied it a lot - the more he was feeling disappointed. I understand his emotions very well because my experience with the global warming theory has been analogous. Eventually, he has probably decided that it had been enough and the catastrophic global warming theory is another example of the hoaxes based on bad and politicized science. So he wrote \\"State of Fear\\". <br /> <br />Although the book is a piece of fiction, it's not pure fiction. The main villains are the members of the ecoterrorist organization NERF (their website is at [...]) that finds the theory of catastrophic global warming so important for their good mood as well as their political ambitions so that when the actual world seems to disagree with their models, they decide to do something with the real world so that the agreement is restored. I am sure that many environmentalists are thinking in this way and other are not, but you can't replicate the whole world in your novel. <br /> <br />This organization, together with various lawyers and other members of the PLM (politico-legal-media) complex, therefore works on gigantic tsunamis and other \\"natural\\" phenomena whose purpose is to convince the public that the climate change is real. Incidentally, the Asian tsunami appeared a few weeks after this book appeared - and let's hope that it's just a coincidence. NERF also sues the U.S. government for having damaged an island. NERF is funded by George Morton, not by George Soros. <br /> <br />I may be the first one to notice that the NERF's boss is named Nicholas Drake. Why is he called Drake? It's because Crichton has identified the Drake equation (one that tries to \\"calculate\\" the number of intelligent civilizations) as the first modern example of non-quantitative pseudoscience that has eventually developed into sleazy theories such as the global warming theory. <br /> <br />The most positive character in the book is John Kenner from MIT who is also a CIA agent, one of the best U.S. skiers, and the best climate expert whose goal is to stop the ecoterrorists. By the way, I did not know that the well-known climate skeptic Richard Lindzen from MIT was such an excellent skier! Or was it John Graham from Harvard who is a good skier? At any rate, Kenner may be a bit too perfect and boring; Morton's lawyer Peter Evans is a more interesting character (one whose opinions develop), much like his blonde girlfriend Sarah Jones. I don't want to tell you the whole story. But one of the encouraging moments is when the meat of Martin Sheen (whose name is, of course, modified in the book) is recycled by his friendly tribes! It's one of the happy ends of the book. <br /> <br />I would give Crichton 4 stars for the prose and 6 stars for his unique combination of science and literature - as you can see the average is 5 stars. The book is a fun reading - pure porn, as one alarmist has called it - for those who don't take the doomsday scenarios too seriously as well for the more sophisticated part of the global warming believers who want to know what's going on in the real world outside their air-conditioned offices.  <br /> <br />The latter should be careful, however. The book contains an unusually large number of graphs that Richard Kenner uses to show that the global warming theory is a hoax in the book. It just happens that the graphs are identical to the graphs in the real world (and the footnotes are also real). Of course, in the real world the people are being brainwashed by the PLM complex more intensely than in the book, and therefore their conclusion may differ from the conclusions of Peter Evans and others even though they have the same graphs. <br /> <br />Crichton also dedicates a few pages to an explanation why he thinks that politicized science is dangerous, and I completely endorse his viewpoint. At any rate, the book is highly recommended to the intelligent readers. <br /> <br />Lubo Motl, Harvard University	2005-02-13
US	51933695	RL8R7SJUL0980	0670033375	635086986	Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed	Books	2	72	199	N	N	Irrational anti-civilization rant based on several anecdotes	This book is weird. Its main message is that the harvesting of timber is the greatest threat to the civilization and there may be similar serious environmental threats that decide about the fate of the societies. This thesis itself contradicts our very basic knowledge about the origins of the civilization. Ten thousand years ago or so, people began to replace the forests by fields and the first primitive forms of agriculture started. This development was completely necessary for our modern civilization to emerge. It was necessary for the appearance of intelligent life on Earth. Diamond does not appreciate this fact, and he even does not seem to realize that timber is a renewable resource. <br /> <br />You would expect that a book about the \\"societies that choose to fail or succeed\\" will focus on the great superpowers and civilizations that were the key players in the global history. You would expect that the book will cover the history of the civilizations of the ancient Iraq, the history of China under various dynasties, the Roman Empire, the Soviet Union, and others. But of course, the fate of the important civilizations does not confirm Diamond's assumptions. For example, the Soviet Union collapsed because its socialist economy was not strong enough to compete with the West in arm races. These are obviously not good arguments for Diamond's strange statements that identify the industry and the population growth as the primary sources of evil, while the climate change and environmental damage are the most important factors that should decide about our lives. <br /> <br />So which societies Diamond chooses to support his hardly defendable claims? An old community in Montana; Greenland; the culture on Easter Island; the Maya; the Anasazi. I have not heard about some of them, so I can't verify whether Diamond's presentation is fair. It's clear that the comparison of those civilizations with the present is ludicrous - but I think that his cherry-picking of the examplesmakes his conclusions unusable even in the case of the ancient societies.  <br /> <br />At any rate, his viewpoint is extremely one-dimensional - more one-dimensional than the viewpoint of Marx who believed that the fate of the societies only depends on the class struggle. The \\"environmental irresponsibility\\" is certainly not a unique factor that decides about the fate of the societies; more important ones are the military power to face other civilizations; the economic power - which is also needed to deal with the cruelties of Nature; stable enough moral standards that don't evaporate. <br /> <br />I give Diamond 2 stars because he's sometimes able to write interesting books - and because he's famous and able to sell this bad book a lot. But otherwise, Diamond does not understand science, history, and the modern era. You know, I was brought up in communist Czechoslovakia and those communists were telling us many strange things. But I don't remember that either of them was as narrow-minded and biased against the prosperous West as Diamond is. Neither of them was questioning that the Western system was a viable one and a tough one to compete with. Neither of them was questioning that the economy had to be strong if the society should survive, and the environmental issue was just one of many factors that should influence our decisions.	2005-01-17
US	51933695	R2RG73G8YR0ZRW	0674011570	265016827	The Discovery of Global Warming (New Histories of Science, Technology, and Medicine)	Books	2	48	127	N	N	Story how a bunch of US junk scientists fought for money	Dr. Weart has received an extra star for his attempt to cover the early history of climate science. That's it. <br /> <br />I was kind of disgusted by this book because what I expected was a story about some scientific discoveries connected with the global climate. A story about the history of science is always fun to read even if it is a little bit biased - for example towards the advocates of the global warming which was expected in this case. <br /> <br />Instead, this book is mostly a story about the money. It's a story about a group of greedy people who were not satisfied with their funding as the scientists and with the \\"boring\\" objective tasks that a scientist must usually solve, and who always wanted to find new sources of funding by claiming a \\"discovery\\" of something new and sensational. And Dr. Weart is completely open and reveals his opinion that it is OK if science is affected by politics. In fact he enjoys it, and as a historian of science, he is happy to analyze this interaction. <br /> <br />Let's hope that I am not the only one who believes that it is unacceptable for scientific research to be affected by politics, and on the other hand that science cannot determine which policies should be adopted. <br /> <br />If you see the book, try to count how many times the word \\"funding\\" appears in it. I find it completely scary. The truth in science does not depend on the money! These global warming alarmists seem to be a culture for which science is a hostage and a tool to achieve something completely different. <br /> <br />If you open this book, you will see many stories about some scientists who were supposed to measure the concentration of some gas somewhere - according to the old-fashioned, objective rules of science. Because they knew that it's unlikely that anything shocking would be found in this way, they decided that they wanted to measure something completely different - something that can be used to argue that there is a big \\"discovery\\" - thisbogus discovery was finally called \\"global warming\\" (well, after the attempts in the 1970s to call it \\"global cooling\\").  <br /> <br />It is a great \\"theory\\" that predicts something 20 years from now - a short enough period to scare the people, but a long enough period to get funding for a long time and to allow the people to forget that you were wrong once it's proved. It's a theory that Weart admits won't ever be quite convincing, but nevertheless the decision making should be based on it. <br /> <br />The book offers, much like many similar books, simplistic arguments that the global climate is simple and its models should be right. Weart does not hesitate to claim that the temperature in 2050 will be up to 5.5 Celsius degrees higher, even though it is known that the temperature in the last 100 years only rose by 0.6 degrees or so. <br /> <br />Even if you forget whether the global warming is true or not, the history as described in this book is completely twisted. For example, it is focused on America only. There is nothing about the 20th century European scientists, for example. And of course, there is nothing about e.g. the influential Russian Academy of Science that identified the Kyoto protocol as a \\"scientifically unfounded nonsense\\".  <br /> <br />Mr. Weart won't tell you such things - instead, he will brainwash you with the obnoxious lies about the \\"scientific consensus\\" - this consensus has become the only real \\"argument\\" of the \\"evangelists\\". It's because he kind of knows that Goebbels said correctly that a lie that is repeated 100 times \\"becomes\\" the truth. <br /> <br />The global climate has been a politicized topic for many decades - but this is one of the first books I've seen which is completely open about the fact that the global warming alarmists are twisting the data - and picking their problems - in order to get more funding and in order to support their political allies.  <br /> <br />Weart also happily attacks the global warming skeptics by the characteristic far left-wing argument that they may have some links to the corporations. Well, I will probably prefer a person paid by a corporation over a person who wants to destroy the corporations - but the actual scientific results don't depend on such things as long as science is done properly. Weart openly says that it should not be done properly. <br /> <br />Weart's book actually describes the very same people as Crichton's \\"State of Fear\\". The difference is that Crichton's novel ends with a happy end - the evil eco-terrorists are either shot, or eaten by the eco-friendly native tribes - while Weart's novel ends as a horror: the same people are celebrated as heroes who are almost allowed to declare their rubbish comments called \\"global warming\\" as one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of the century. <br /> <br />I am ashamed that these global warming people are sometimes identified as our colleagues. <br /> <br />Dr. Lubos Motl, Harvard University	2004-12-28

But fun was not the only thing in Feynman's life. \\"What Do you Care What Other People Think\\" is a rather different book. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong: there are various funny stories in this book, too. And the book also describes various controversies - for example the story in which the silly feminists called Feynman \\"a sexist pig\\". Feynman never hesitated to inform morons (especially the pompous fools) that they were morons, and this book is another proof of it. Nevertheless, the main focus of the book is different. <br /> <br />Feynman first talks about his childhood - especially his father who taught him to question the orthodox thinking, and who probably always wanted Richard to become a scientist. On the other hand, Feynman's father was not an intellectual. One of the special features of Feynman is that he was brought up in an ordinary family - not in a family of professors which is unfortunately the case of most professors today. <br /> <br />The second part of the book is very sad and very emotional. It's about his first wife, Arlene. I think that the book will show you how much they loved each other and how big influence Arlene had on Feynman. Well, a problem was that she suffered from tuberculosis. She was dying while Feynman was working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos. This part of the book could compete with any good fiction - the difference is that this story is real and it happened to one of the most influential physicists of all time. I am sure that you will agree that Feynman's heart was at least as strong as his brain. <br /> <br />However, it's not just a sad love story: Feynman also describes their tricks that they used to send letters to each other (circumventing the censorship in Los Alamos) and other amusing details of this period. <br /> <br />The third portion (about 55%) of the book is dedicated to the commission that investigated the explosion of the Challenger, the space shuttle in 1986. Feynman was always eager to get to the very heart of the matter and he never cared whether he looked \\"nice\\" to others. Even Ronald Reagan knew about that, and therefore he personally asked Feynman to serve on the committee (with Neil Armstrong and others). <br /> <br />Feynman did not disappoint and the book reveals the findings in depth - well sometimes the description is too detailed, I would say. It shows how some people in NASA - for example an executive called William Rogers - preferred the image (their personal image as well as the image of NASA) over the truth. You will also learn about many technical details that have led to the explosion. Feynman was thinking differently - unlike the chairman of the commission who thought that everyone should sit in a room and ask the experts, Feynman decided to talk to the engineers. Feynman's analysis is also a critique of the government bureaucracy. <br /> <br />Although NASA was probably a unified force when it sent the first men to the Moon, it became fragmented afterwards, Feynman argues. The engineers estimated the probability of the failure to be about 1:300, while the top bosses were painting an optimistic picture to the Congress that the probability of an explosion was about 1:100,000, and NASA can be both cheap as well as efficient. <br /> <br />Feynman's most visible conclusion is that the space shuttle program may have been a mistake because the public had to be fooled that the project was better than it actually was.  <br /> <br />Feynman always believed that the public must be allowed to decide whether they want to fund you and your projects, after you honestly tell them what the project means. Unlike many unrealistic people in the academia who believe that an arbitrary amount of money paid for an arbitrary project in science is a good investment - and that it is always OK to fool the ordinary people to get some money - Feynman understood economics and the workings of the society very well. Moreover, honesty was his primary goal in debates with the laymen. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, Feynman advocates science and its principles. However, you don't need to be trained in physics to understand the book.	2004-12-04

His article included many funny comments: for example, the value of pi became a result of political pressures - and other facts in physics were interpreted as consequences of the interactions between the genders, and so on.<br /><br />It was accepted because it sounded cool to the editors of that journal - in fact, they found the article flattering - and the fact that it was nonsense did not change anything about their decision to accept the article. In another journal, Sokal had simultaneously announced that his article was a hoax.<br /><br />The full text of this article is contained in this book as an appendix and some explanations of the article and its meaning have been added. However the book by Sokal and Bricmont, two mathematical physicists, contains much more interesting material about all these marvelous people such as Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Paul Virilio, and many others. Many of them, but not all, are French.<br /><br />You will see how these authors misuse scientific concepts. For example, one of these postmodernist intellectuals will explain you that neurosis is connected with the topology of torus. It's just incredible how much weird stuff they could find - and most likely, there exists much more of it.

Let me call them simply morons. You will see that these morons are only capable to use the scientific terms as sequences of letters, but they can't imagine any objective or verifiable reality behind these letters. In fact, these morons don't believe any objective reality - they imagine that science is analogous to the dances of primitive tribes in Polynesia. They believe that our conclusions whether a scientific theory is correct or not has \\"social causes\\". This book, however, will show you much more.

US	51933695	R1SCXBW127GSGT	0521837332	918687704	Quantum Gravity (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics)	Books	2	32	99	N	N	Wrong philosophy, incorrect math, not very good book	It is guaranteed that many people who have not seen the book - and who have no idea about physics (for example, linux evangelists) - will write a lot of irrelevant \\"reviews\\", but I am sure that those who are able to think will know which reviews are serious and which reviews are not.    I am among those who really enjoy searching for errors in physics books. While the good books usually have a couple of hundreds of typos and roughly five errors of a slightly conceptual flavor, it may be easier to enumerate the correct and valuable statements in Rovelli's book rather than the errors. The problems with this book are rather serious, numerous, and fundamental. It's mainly because the chosen point of view on the topic is problematic and perhaps obsolete.    First of all, the title is inappropriate and overly ambitious. The book does not cover quantum gravity (QG) - this term includes, among many other insights, semiclassical gravity, the calculation of particle production and Hawking radiation, the black hole information puzzle and black hole thermodynamics; holography, the AdS/CFT correspondence and other mechanisms of appearance and disappearance of spacetime dimensions; physics at the Planck scale, physics of spacetime singularities and application of quantum theory to cosmology; graviton scattering; quantum corrections to geometry, geometric dualities such as T-duality and mirror symmetry, topology changes and other topics arising in string theory; quantum effects influencing locality, causality, and the arrow of time; the origin of gravity and its interplay with other forces and particles. Rovelli's book does not really explain either of these topics.    The author starts with some terminological issues. For example, he redefines the word \\"relativistic\\" in such a way that the special theory of relativity is \\"nonrelativistic\\". It's not just a matter of unusual language: Rovelli repeatedly contradicts the fact that a theory XY must locally reduce to special relativityif XY should be called \\"general relativity\\" (GR). The models he presents probably do not respect the laws of special relativity - they are not relativistic in the usual meaning of the word - and consequently they're problematic from the viewpoint of experimental validity as well as according to the very purpose of GR: the only reason why Einstein had to look for a new theory of gravity was the required compatibility with his special theory of relativity. Because the adjective \\"relativistic\\" has a positive flavor in it, Rovelli decided to redefine it so that his promoted theory can be called \\"relativistic\\" even though it is not (according to the usual understanding of the word).    The initial chapter seems as an idiosyncratic account of reasoning about QG before anything sound about QG was known. This chapter also presents another adjective that is very popular in the LQG community: \\"background-independent\\". Rovelli correctly points out some complications that quantized geometry adds to the usual concepts of quantum field theory such as the operator product expansions. Many of these problems are simply solved by writing the metric as the sum of a nonzero classical background (a vacuum expectation value) plus a quantum, operator-valued fluctuation. This is the usual approach in particle physics and string theory and the main target of Rovelli's attacks. He does not say that such a decomposition is necessary for the concepts like the S-matrix to make sense. He does not say that such a decomposition does not eliminate the general covariance of the physical results (which really means decoupling of the unphysical modes). He does not say that even Newton's laws can be written in a background-independent fashion. Finally, he does not say that being \\"background independent\\" is vacuous unless one can show that the theory predicts many different geometric backgrounds (which is not likely in the case of LQG). He also hides the fact that there are different Hamiltonian LQG theories for different spacetime topologies; unlike string theory, LQG does not allow topology change.    The space limitations are forcing me to truncate the review; see [...] for the full text.	2004-11-20

However, despite the size, this book should not be counted as one of the textbooks of string theory. It focuses on various solutions of general relativity and its extensions - supergravity - which arise as low energy limits of string theory.<br /><br />The characteristic physics and mathematics of string theory (such as perturbative string theory and conformal field theory) is not discussed too thoroughly. In this sense, the book is not a competitor of Polchinski's \\"String Theory\\" or Green+Schwarz+Witten's \\"Superstring Theory\\", but it can still be a useful source of various classical solutions.	2004-11-14
US	51933695	R3BV1QZ5AI67WU	0226458083	89443239	The Structure of Scientific Revolutions	Books	2	14	26	N	N	Kuhn's ideas apply to philosophy of science	Let me give Kuhn two stars. One of them is for Kuhn's ability to invent catchy phrases - such as the \\"paradigm shift\\" - that have made him famous not only among the philosophers.<br /><br />The other one is for his fair attempt to study psychological effects associated with dramatic discoveries in science. I don't think that Kuhn explicitly states in his book that there is no objective truth that constrains which theories are better than others; but he obviously uses such formulations that naturally lead many readers of his book to similar absurd statements.<br /><br />Otherwise I find this book hard to read. But more importantly, it is superficial. Kuhn obviously believes that he is able to reveal some mysterious psychological facts about the behavior of the scientists. Moreover, he seems to think that the scientific progress could be slowed down or sped up if the behavior of the scientists were modified appropriately.<br /><br />In philosophy of science, it may be true. The progress in philosophy is fictitious; the philosophers are inventing new words, and they are continuously returning to the old ideas, in order to revive even older ideas a year later. If we tell them to change their opinions more often, the progress in philosophy will be faster. Kuhn's book itself is an example of the \\"paradigm shift\\" in philosophy of science - which really means that he did not discover anything new, but he was able to emphasize one obviously well-known specific aspect of the history of science (the difference between the \\"revolutions\\" and \\"normal science\\") and this aspect became fashionable for a while. Another philosopher may promote another aspect that becomes fashionable, and we will return to a pre-Kuhn era again. There is no real progress here: only the opinions are being changed back and forth.<br /><br />However, this is not how science works. Science is making a real progress and the steps cannot really be \\"undone\\". Despite the centuries that we have spent with science, we still have no universal rules how to behave in order to speed up the scientific progress. Science is not that easy. You may propose that the scientists should be proposing bolder and more speculative ideas; you may recommend them to follow other scientists more or less faithfully; you may tell them to rely on the \\"current\\" textbook wisdoms more dogmatically, or less dogmatically.<br /><br />Be sure that none of these rules is good enough to speed up the scientific progress. In order for a person to make a revolution in theoretical physics, she must - first of all - know the important true facts about the physical phenomena that she intends to describe in a new way. This includes the knowledge of the trustworthy aspects of the \\"old\\" theories, as well as some underestimated, but important features of the existing knowledge (and perhaps some experiments that look like details, but are really the key). Finally, she must believe the right principles.<br /><br />Of course, the difficult task is to identify the \\"important pieces\\" and the \\"right principles\\" and figure out how to use them to make the \\"paradigm shift\\" - or at least how to convert them into an interesting piece of scientific work. (I could use the words \\"paradigm shift\\" because I gave him one star for this phrase.) A scientist must be smart as well as lucky to make the right choice. But what is the right choice depends on the particular situation and Kuhn's general rules cannot help her.<br /><br />One can ask whether the question about the importance of this piece is an objective question. Of course, it is hard to reach agreement about the answer if we talk about a very open and controversial question that is currently under investigation. Moreover, the discoveries are often made in an \\"illogical order\\".<br /><br />Nevertheless I find it pretty clear that in the long run, the results of the scientific developments become virtually independent of these short-term coincidences. This fact also makes it possible to analyze the importance of scientific contributions that were made a long time ago. Incidentally, it seems to me that Kuhn would disagree even with this statement - but this statement is necessary for us to draw any conclusions from the history of science.<br /><br />Even though we have learned many lessons from the history of science (well, many very different lessons) - and we have read books like this one - and we also know many things about the nature of various ideas and about psychology of other scientists, we still do not know what is the right way to solve the cosmological constant problem, for example. Most of philosophy of science is just a superficial description of some common features of the historical events. Unfortunately it is not enough to say something about the real scientific questions, and this fact makes books like Kuhn's work pretty much useless for scientists and for others who want to make genuine progress.also makes it possible to analyze the importance of scientific contributions that were made a long time ago.

It had many useful definitions and theorems in it and its rigorous, but readable approach seemed attractive to me and almost converted me into a rigorous mathematician, but obviously it turned out to be too abstract at the end. <br /> <br />However, the main problem was that several years later, because of particle-physics motivations, I tried to learn some things about the Lie groups, Lie algebras (e.g. exceptional Lie algebras), and their representations, and initially I assumed that such a big book had to contain something useful about these topics. It did not, I think. <br /> <br />This book is very good if you want to learn most of the rigorous math, partly based on the generalized abstract nonsense (also known as category theory), as it was known decades ago - the definitions and basic theorems about the basic algebraic structures.

But it is certainly among the highly recommended ones.<br /><br />Feynman was an original thinker - his thinking was always \\"different\\". On the other hand, his thinking was also very ordinary, in a sense. He was a very good teacher. He could always  understand what is the \\"natural\\" conclusion that most of people make about a question, and he could identify where this thinking goes wrong. This is where he focused his teaching energy.<br /><br />This book contains less equations than most other technical textbooks about the subject. This feature may have some disadvantages, but it certainly has advantages, too. You really need words, not just equations, if you want to explain why some common interpretations of the formalism are misleading, and Feynman does so at many places.<br /><br />Feynman uses the power of jokes - for example when he defines the concept of a velocity. (Well, the feminists are probably not too happy about this joke, but they are probably not among the readers of this book anyway.) The book also carries another message: about the very basic principles of science as such. What does it mean that a scientific theory is successful? He makes it clear that the physical description of our Universe is one of the main parts of the real culture of our era - and he also humiliates most philosophers.<br /><br />Even though this was not the main textbook that taught me physics, I still remember several Feynman's points that were important for me - such as his explanations of resonance. But the most remarkable is Feynman's approach to quantum mechanics. Feynman himself is the originator of the \\"sum over histories\\" approach to quantum mechanics. But of course, it is not the (only) approach that he wants to explain in the book.<br /><br />Nevertheless his approach to teaching quantum mechanics is unusual, too. He does not really start with the wavefunctions of a particle moving on the line, which is what a typical textbook does. Instead, he studies several systems with two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It is an extremely useful approach for the reader to understand the interpretational issues of quantum mechanics.<br /><br />What do I mean? The wavefunction is not a classical wave, even though it may look so. It is a mathematical object that encodes the probabilities, and the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces make it more transparent. His examples also make it more obvious that different bases in the same Hilbert space (and different operators) can be equally important and natural, and should be treated democratically. Finally, he also explains the errors of the original reasoning of Einstein (and Podolsky and Rosen) when he suggested that quantum mechanics led to \\"paradoxes\\".<br /><br />Other textbooks often lead the readers to believe that the position operator is special after all, and various deterministic interpretations of the wave function (such as de Broglie's and Bohm's theory of the pilot wave) can be valid - and it is exactly the position of the particle that should also have a \\"classical\\" value. Feynman was among those who understood quantum mechanics properly and he chose the right strategy to explain it.<br /><br />The interpretation of quantum mechanics is not a subject that we teach too carefully, and the students (and not just students) sometimes do not know what is the \\"canonical\\" answer.

US	51933695	R2K8G19C2IR1YF	0486659690	502894008	Quantum Theory (Dover Books on Physics)	Books	3	91	191	N	N	Cheap, fair book which you can't treat too seriously	This is a fair textbook of quantum mechanics, and it is very cheap. Well, I mean cheap as well as cheap. It does not contain too much mathematics. However, the words are usually good substitutes. The book covers the usual basic material of quantum mechanics based on the wavefunctions; the particle in the most usual potentials; perturbation theory; the concept of spin, and so forth.    However, I don't think that David Bohm was really among those who understood the meaning of quantum mechanics too well - and based on the other reviews, I think that the readers who claim that they finally understood quantum mechanics from this book have not really gotten the point either. Well, don't get me wrong: the book was written in 1950 and at that time, Bohm more or less believed the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics even though he had many more doubts about the important principles of QM than what would have been appropriate.    Nevertheless, David Bohm spends relatively too much time with his (rather unsuccessful) speculations about the \\"deeper\\", deterministic structure underlying quantum mechanics. David Bohm's second most well-known contribution to physics (after the Aharonov-Bohm effect) is his new version of the pilot wave theory, initiated by de Broglie in the late 1920s and used to change the interpretation of quantum mechanics.     His new interpretation is based on the idea that the wavefunction is a real wave, and moreover there also exists a classical particle with a well-defined position. These two objects classically interact in such a way that the probabilistic results of quantum mechanics can be reproduced in several simplest contexts.    However, this is not a correct idea for more convoluted systems; experimentally speaking, it contradicts special relativity (as required in relativistic quantum field theory), the existence of spin, and so forth. More generally, even without these advanced concepts in quantum mechanics, Bohm's idea goes against the spirit of quantum mechanics with its Hilbert spaces and different bases and operators on the same Hilbert space that are \\"equally important\\".    Bohm's prejudices about determinism and the special role of the position operator may have followed from his unfortunate, conventional technical approach to quantum mechanics that always starts with wavefunctions in the position representation - an approach chosen also in this book. This representation leads many readers to the wrong conclusion that the wavefunction is something like a real classical wave in space - much like the electromagnetic wave - and that the position has a special role among the observables. I say \\"observable\\" because Bohm tries to humiliate the concept of an operator.    I agree with others who say that we are not spending enough time by teaching the interpretational issues of quantum mechanics. Bohm's book does so. However I disagree that Bohm's approach is a good one. Instead, I would recommend Feynman's lectures on physics. Feynman's pedagogical treatment of quantum mechanics starts with two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. They are very useful because the reader understands that different bases (and operators) in the same Hilbert space may be equally important, and that the probabilistic interpretation of the amplitudes is absolutely essential.    The magician Uri Geller has convinced David Bohm that he (Geller) had supernatural abilities - a point that Feynman liked to ridicule. I am afraid that this transformation of Bohm at the end of his life might be related to his exaggerated emphasis on philosophical prejudices in quantum mechanics, as opposed to the pragmatic goal to extract useful predictions.    Quantum mechanics is weird. Sidney Coleman said that if thousands of philosophers had been trying, for thousands of years, to find the weirdest thing possible, they would have had never found a thing as weird as quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics works, and we know that wecan extract the information about probabilities of anything. (And the new insights about decoherence also explain where the difference between macroscopic and microscopic objects comes from.) In this sense I feel that the approach to quantum mechanics \\"Shut up and calculate\\" is a better one than wasting time with a wrong philosophy.    Despite the criticism, the book is cheap enough so that I can recommend you to buy it. David Bohm was an interesting person even though he was a communist.	2004-09-25

No doubt, he is a very special person - a talented businessman and an excellent computer scientist, too. He also started as a promising, very young physicist. These are the reasons why I gave the book an extra star that it would not deserve otherwise. <br /> <br />Many people have criticized Wolfram for his pretending that he is the inventor of all these rather standard ideas and facts in computer science. I think that these critics are right. But enough has been written about this aspect of his work. Moreover, computer science is not my field anymore. <br /> <br />I want to say a couple of words about Wolfram's ambitions to apply these ideas to natural science - a new kind of physics, so to say. I am surprised how the reasoning of such an exceptional mind can become so superficial, narrow-minded, cheap, and isolated from reality and the ideas of others. <br /> <br />Wolfram seems to be very impressed by that simple algorithm that produces an irregular, \\"unpredictable\\" pattern. The physicists like me just don't understand why. How can such a smart person be impressed with something so common? Most systems in physics (and science) that can be written down cannot be solved exactly - we usually say that they are not integrable. Even the system of three massive bodies (planets) that obey the simple laws of Newton lead to motion that cannot be expressed in terms of \\"ordinary\\" functions. <br /> <br />It is not shocking to find a system whose behavior looks irregular and unpredictable, even though - I realize - most of those 256 simplest cellular automata are integrable. On the contrary: the physicists are usually impressed if someone shows that a set of equations *can* be solved. They are happy if someone shows that a seemingly irregular pattern exhibits some deeper rules. <br /> <br />The cellular automata are nice toy models in computer science, and they are similar to discretized models in classical physics (namely classical local field theory). But that's it. Classical field theory is, roughly speaking, an achievement of physics of the 18th century. Thousands of new and amazing ideas have been found in physics, especially in the 20th century. <br /> <br />Wolfram seems to see one idea only - the idea of the cellular automata. The output of a simple computer program looks like a piece of tiger's skin - and it is apparently enough for Wolfram to think that his program, or something very similar, probably contains all of science including biology. Well, it is obvious that these simple models can never agree with the pillars of modern physics, such as Einstein's relativity (1905) and especially the principles of quantum mechanics (1926). They are what they seem to be: simple material for students of computer science. Physics - and even Mathematica - contains many more organizing ideas and structure that is necessary for them to work. <br /> <br />It seems to me that several decades ago, Wolfram had to know all these fields of physics very well. What happened afterwards? Why does Wolfram suddenly say, much like a generic crackpot, that everything is encoded in one, rather naive idea? Does he really believe that the content of ANKOS is so important, or did he just want to earn some more money? I am not sure which answer is more worrisome.	2004-09-25

My feeling is that he knows more about Russian history than those who are specialized in humanities. Think about any two people whom you know and who lived in the 19th century or the early 20th century (two Russian writers, for example), and Michael will be able to tell you what was the relationship between these two people, when they met, and why it was important. What you read in this book about Mendeleev is just a fraction of what Michael could tell you about the 19th century.<br />Moreover, he also understands the important technical points of chemistry - in fact, not just chemistry: physics, mathematics, and other sciences are his cup of tea, too. Therefore his presentation is not superficial: you will learn the right things about the right ideas and their evolution, about the wrong ideas as well as about the influence of politics and ghosts.<br />Michael Gordin's Russian is very good and it helped him to understand all the relevant events and links between the contemporaries of Mendeleev as he studied the archives in St Petersburg (and perhaps also Moscow). Incidentally, he also learned Czech - which is my first language - because at some moment he decided that it is helpful to follow some old letters about chemistry.<br />Anyone who is interested in chemistry, history of science, or Russian history should immediately buy this book because Michael Gordin was the right person to write it, and you will certainly learn a lot about all these issues. Moreover, Mendeleev might be the most famous chemist ever and his life was rich enough to keep you excited as you read through these 300+ pages of a superb text.	2004-05-03

In fact, it seems that he has combined nearly all popular misunderstandings associated with the speed of light.<br />One of the most general consequences of Einstein's special relativity from 1905 is that no physical signal (or a piece of matter) can ever move faster than light. The speed of light plays a very important role according to this famous theory. Although a lot of new insights have been accumulated since 1905, the previous sentence remained valid. Einstein discovered general relativity in 1916, and this theory of gravity allows spacetime to become warped - in fact, this theory was found exactly because Einstein knew that Newton's theory of gravity allowed the signals to be sent superluminally, and therefore it contradicted special relativity. Newton's theory could not be quite correct.<br />Moreover, many physicists have studied various solutions of general relativity that admit the closed time-like curves, i.e. time travels. Although most scientists believe that these solutions are unphysical because of various reasons (such as instability), it is legitimate to study such solutions, and many popular books have been written about these solutions.<br />Herbert's approach is more primitive. In most of his book, he wants to derive the existence of faster-than-light motion (and time travels, which are then an inevitable consequence) from special relativity itself. One of the main points of special relativity is that exactly this is impossible. There exists a concept of tachyons (from Greek &quot;tachos&quot; which means &quot;speed&quot;), fictitious particles that always move faster than light. Quantum field theory shows that the existence of such particles would also make the Universe unstable because such tachyons could be created in pairs (their energy can be both negative as well as positive). Many of my fellow string theorists revisited the question of tachyons(initially, we would simply eliminate every version of string theory that predicts a tachyon), but all of them agree that the existence of tachyons in the real world would spell doom for the whole Universe. The real goal of the recent calculations involving tachyons in string theory is really to find out the final state of the collapsing Universe (or a membrane floating in the Universe).<br />Herbert is also confused by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect in quantum mechanics. He thinks that the entanglement - the correlations between distant objects in the Universe - can be used to send information. No, that's not possible. In his example involving calcium vapors, he does not appreciate that the information comes from the vapor source, not the crystal, and therefore the crystal can't send any usable information. The EPR effect allows correlations between distant objects, but because the outcome of the experiments are random (quantum mechanics only predicts probabilities), there is no way for us to affect the outcome of a faraway experiment i.e. no way to send an e-mail faster than light, for example.<br />I could continue: he incorrectly interprets the large phase speed of some vibrations in the upper atmosphere, violation of the CP (and T) symmetries by the kaons, and so on. If you want to get the wrong answer to all conceivable questions related to the speed of light, buy this book. If you prefer to learn how the Nature really works, I recommend you a different book. For example &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot; by Brian Greene explains nearly everything about space and time, including a very entertaining (yet correct) treatment of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect.	2004-02-21

Joao Magueijo's theory is unimpressive - in fact, let's admit that it is silly. The author has showed that he has no idea what relativity means. Undergraduate physics students worldwide are being showed the overwhelming evidence supporting Einstein's special relativity - thousands of accelerator experiments as well as many cosmological and other observations. Every theoretical physicist - including good physics students - knows that she can consistently use the units in which the speed of light is simply equal to one, and all equations involving special relativity simplify. Moreover, one meter is defined to be 1/299792458 of the path that light travels through in one second. It simply means that according to our current definitions of the units, the speed of light is constant and it has always been. We don't gain anything by considering a &quot;variable speed of light&quot;, it is just a trivial choice of units and the units in which the speed is variable are artificial and useless. The real physics is hidden elsewhere.<br />There are plenty of speculative theories that propose various violations of the Lorentz invariance - the main symmetry that implies special relativity. The difference between Joao Magueijo and others, i.e. more serious scientists, is that the latter realize that their theory must also explain the amazing accuracy with which relativity describes the known phenomena, and therefore all deviations from the Lorentz invariance must be tamed. Usually they start from a relativistic theory and break the Lorentz invariance spontaneously; it is not the case of Joao Magueijo. Although special relativity has been known since 1905 - almost for 100 years - Joao Magueijo stll has not gotten what the theory means. He also misunderstood the relation between special relativity and general relativity, and therefore he is not able to put hissuperficial knowledge of cosmology into a bigger picture: general relativity is an extension of special relativity that explains gravity (by spacetime curvature), but the laws of special relativity continue to hold locally.<br />The other aspect is a sociological one. Joao Magueijo is a rebel who wants to initiate a revolution that would replace the old &quot;dinosaurs&quot; by young scientists. He accuses many respected scientists (and the editors of science journals) of &quot;idiocy&quot;, and so on. That would be fine if he were smarter than they are. Unfortunately his knowledge of physics is poor and he has nothing real to contribute. In my opinion, he should not have earned a PhD in physical sciences. In fact, he is much more interested in his being visible than real science. Although I would find it healthier if our young generation had a bigger impact on the developments of physics and cosmology, I am certainly not ready to pay any price. Replacing great (although older) scientists - who have done a lot of amazing progress decades ago and who are still active - by these young pseudo-scientists is just a too high price to pay. Physics is getting more difficult. People must learn bigger amounts of stuff before they can make meaningful new discoveries, and therefore the average age of the &quot;leaders of the field&quot; has increased a little bit. If a real new revolution - for example one initiated by some new shocking experimental discoveries in particle physics (that have not been done for decades) - starts, I am sure that the average age would drop again. There is no good reason to &quot;engineer&quot; a new social structure of the science community. It is the quality of research that should be the most important goal.<br />It is sad that the people like Joao Magueijo can get a job (&quot;reader&quot;) in Europe (the fact that the average age of faculty members is clearly higher in Europe than it is in America makes it even more surprising), and it is a good example showing that America is obviously ahead. The competition in the U.S.A. is simply much tighter, and arrogant crackpots similar to Joao Magueijo would have a very small chance to get a job in the States. Although one should also say that Joao Magueijo has made it to the New York Times. Well, the journalists like sensations and they're not always able to distinguish whether there is some real idea behind the sensation or not.<br />Unimpressive.	2004-02-21

Even the people like me - who learned English as the second language and who will always prefer their first language - are showed that English can be used to write high-quality literature.<br />While \\"The Elegant Universe\\" focused on the search for the unified theory and space and time played a secondary role, they have become the main players in \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\". Greene starts with some fancy philosophical questions (investigated together with Albert Camus) about the problem of suicide, but he quickly realizes that the workings of the Universe have always been more important.<br />You will learn nearly everything about our understanding of space and time and their history. The real story of space starts with Newton's thought experiments with an ordinary spinning bucket of water. How can one distinguish a spinning bucket from a bucket at rest? How does the water know whether it is spinning or not? Greene explains how Newton's rival Gottfried von Leibniz disagreed with Newton's main goal, which was to prove the existence of space, more precisely a kind of spirit that fills it. Leibniz's relational viewpoint was defeated, but Ernst Mach revived it for a while. Although Einstein liked Mach's principle, his theories of relativity have essentially killed it again and confirmed a new reincarnation of Newton's ideas. Each of us is cutting the spacetime as a loaf of bread, and each of us does it a bit differently.

Well, as a physicist I must confirm that Greene's story is not a mere analogy, but a description of a doable experiment! In another chapter, Greene offers a very balanced and comprehensive summary of all major mental frameworks to interpret quantum mechanics. Does the wavefunction collapse? What is decoherence?

Most of us are getting older, but we're rarely getting younger. The laws of physics see virtually no difference between the past and the future, so where does this asymmetry come from? Greene follows Ludwig Boltzmann and just on the verge of accepting an absurd interpretation of reality (in which you should never trust your memory), he reveals that this whole asymmetry may be blamed on a special, ordered character of the young Universe. You will understand what the entropy and thermodynamics is all about.<br />That's a good place for Greene to explain everything about the history of the cosmos: inflation, its symmetries, vaporization of vacuum, creation of the first lumps of matter, time's arrow, and entropy. Greene can't forget his own field. Two large chapters are dedicated to string/M-theory. He exploits the opportunity to describe many recently found aspects of the theory that could not have been covered in The Elegant Universe. Two examples: Holography means that one of the spatial dimensions we see may be an illusion because all of us can be really living on a two-dimensional hologram. On the other hand, all of us may be stuck on a three-dimensional membrane floating in a higher-dimensional Universe, as the recent braneworld scenarios suggest. A violent colission with another membranemight be vital for the evolution of our Universe.<br />Greene describes the current and future experiments in particle physics and cosmology that are designed to test some of these dramatic ideas. He also talks about the wormholes and time travels. Although he admits that time travels are likely to remain in the realm of dreams, you won't resist his thought experiments that show that some of the apparent paradoxes of time travels may be overcome. One also learns a lot of specific stuff about teleportation (a way to transport an object from A to B without its appearance in the middle). Although we're only able to teleport individual particles today, I am sure that you will be provoked to think bigger. A final chapter speculates about the future of all these ideas.

The first road is superstring theory (or M-theory). The mainstream is convinced that string theory is our leading candidate to describe all the particles and all the interactions and to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. According to string theory, different particle species are loops of string vibrating in different ways. Brian Greene has described string theory in The Elegant Universe beautifully and the reader will probably learn nothing new from this Smolin's book. <br />The second road is the so-called Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). This framework, started by Abhay Ashtekar and his friends, offers a way to reformulate the original equations written down by Einstein using some new variables leading to Wilson loops in the role of the fundamental observables. While most theoretical physicists believe that this approach is marginal and probably inconsistent, Smolin would like to &quot;unify&quot; it with superstring theory although M-theory and LQG contradict each other quite clearly in many aspects. The reader gets disappointed because he or she will not find out what is the relation between the loop of LQG and the string of string theory. There is none. The experts know it but the laymen can become confused. <br />The third road, according to Smolin, is a fuzzy collection of speculations invented by the philosophers of various kinds who would like to refuse everything that physicists have learned and to base everything on ill-defined &quot;profound&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; philosophical principles. Wolfgang Pauli would certainly say that the third road &quot;is not even wrong&quot;. Unfortunately, Smolin likes to pretend that marginal directions of research are essential and that people like Finkelstein, Isham, Penrose, Sorkin (and Smolin himself) are heroes of physics today. Read the book if you liked the readable and anecdotal style of the Smolin's previous book &quot;The Life of the Cosmos&quot; or if you like to hear highly idiosyncratic comments about this exciting subject or if you like to speculate about questions as usually asked by laymen and philosophers. However if you want the author to teach you the right questions and the right answers from physics as understood by real physicists or if you want to learn who are the real heroes of the field and what dramatic discoveries have they done - for example Stephen Hawking or today especially Ed Witten - buy The Elegant Universe instead. Smolin's ideas have always remained outside the mainstream; &quot;Three Roads&quot; are no exception. And the readers should know it.	2001-08-20

I have seen several  public talks of Josh McDowell (one of them was called Maximal Sex) and he  is a very entertaining person. Unlike the other reviewers, I do believe  that McDowell was not born as a Christian and that he was a very  anti-religious person before. Such people with very superficial opinions  become the most convinced converts. I find Christian liberalism boring and  dishonest in a certain way so that McDowell's version of the fundamentalism  is simple and foolish enough to look cute. The style of this book reminds  me of the famous Sidney Harris's cartoon (here you have a lot of  complicated formulae and logical thinking, here a miracle occurs, and these  are the results). Jesus was not a Lunatic since he did not look insane.  Such a nice person could not be a Liar either. Consequently, he had to be  the God, of course. Sure. Maybe McDowell's grandson will claim the same  about David Copperfield. I recommend this book to the readers who want to  see how simple-minded and naive Christianity can be - and also to the  people who share McDowell's temperament, belief and his level of the  scientific rigour.	2000-08-26

The scalar Klein-Gordon field is used as a pedagogical example at the beginning. The philosophy of the path integral  is used all over the book. However, the book does not emphasize the  philosophy of the Wilson renormalization group and in this sense the primer  is not modern. Nevertheless, Pierre Ramond is a pretty famous scientist and  you can learn many things from this book.	2000-05-12

He was also the first man who published a book on theoretical physics that has  become popular world-wide (about 9 million copies have been sold). Many  readers have learned a lot of exciting things about our universe from this  book. So did I - even though I was a student of theoretical physics.  Although this book is not as perfect as Brian Greene's &quot;The Elegant  Universe&quot;, the successor of the Hawking's book in the position of the  book on theoretical physics causing such a stir, &quot;A Brief History of  Time&quot; will remain a tour de force, a pioneering work which began a new  interest in physics among masses of people. That is why do I recommend you  to read this book about the big bang, black holes, the quest for the  ultimate theory and many other issues.	2000-05-10

The whole series is perfectly organized and the material is divided into pieces of reasonable size which can be swallowed one after another. The reader can appreciate the beauty of every single piece of knowledge. I recommend this series especially to those  readers who already have some general knowledge of maths and physics and  who are able to study for themselves; it is also a very useful reference  for professionals. The volume on quantum mechanics has taught me a lot  about the structure of nuclei, atoms and molecules (in fact also about the  chemistry) - and also about the symmetries and the special functions  encountered in the field of quantum mechanics. Feynman's lectures on  physics are also great (albeit alternative) but the course of Landau and  Lifshitz is a standard for anyone looking for the best presentation of  physics by 1960s.	2000-05-10

Although this book is hard to read, it might be a good toy for children below 5 years of age (kind of &quot;kindergarten  science&quot;) who also believe in Santa Claus - be prepared that your  child will believe that dinosaurs lived few years ago and he/she will wish  to have one! Of course it is dangerous if those inaccurate statements (and  their scientifically incorrect conclusions contradicting essentially whole  paleontology, geology and physics) are read by older people who take them  seriously. Do not panic, crazy opinions about the history of the universe  are not deadly and if you like God a lot, you can spend a pretty happy life  thinking about the famous George Washington's dinosaur farm.<br />In order to  show how such arguments are collected, let me tell you a story about the  author. In July of 1982, Dr. Duane Gish debated Dr. Russell Doolittle on  public TV. In response to the argument for evolution involving molecular  taxonomy, Gish claimed that some blood proteins were more similar between  bullfrogs and man than between chimpanzees and man. His source was a story  told by Garniss Curtis (UC Berkeley) at the July, 1971 Wenner-Gren  conference in Austria. It seems there was a rumor of study comparing blood  proteins of humans and bullfrogs that gave the above result (perhaps from  the Transylvanian Academy of Sciences?). Curtis predicted (correctly) that  the result would not be published or repeated, because it was a dreadful  tragedy - the frog was actually an enchanted prince!<br />Gish defends himself  by saying he thought Curtis was serious! I, for one, believe Gish - he has  made a career out of going around telling jokes and calling them science,  and I find it easy to believe he can't tell the difference.	2000-03-24

He is right. In a previous review I wrote that Radin said that &quot;none (except of prof.  Scargle) gave him less than 4 stars&quot; and that Radin  &quot;overlooked&quot; the review by the &quot;reader from Pittsburgh&quot;  called &quot;one good chapter&quot; which gave him 3 stars. <br />I should  have written that Radin had written that &quot;22 are rated 4 or 5 stars.  Only 3 reviews give 1 star, and all three of those are posted by one person  [prof. Scargle]&quot; and that Radin &quot;forgot&quot; to explicitly  mention the review that gave him 3 stars. If you read it carefully, you  will find the difference. I appologize that I did not read his positive  (5-stars) review of his book carefully enough and that I did not appreciate  his clever trick to hide the critic from Pittsburgh.<br />I hope that this  comment will help Radin to sell his book and psychic phenomena to spread  all over the world. With the exception of one chapter or so (containing  more or less interesting data), the primary purpose of the Conscious  Universe is to attack sceptics and it seems that Radin cannot endure a  single critic (and therefore he wrote the review against prof. Scargle and  therefore he also wrote me the e-mail). The future of parapsychology is in  censorship which will eliminate all the opinions (and all the experiments)  that disagree with it. Radin has made first steps towards such an ideal  scientifically psychic society.	2000-03-23

However, solid statistical evidence is overwhelmed by telling the reader amusing stories. The fact that selective reporting accounts for virtually all the strange claims by Dean Radin becomes obvious  if we look at reviews of this book, for example. Radin wrote that none  (except of prof. Scargle) gave him less than 4 stars. Radin  &quot;overlooked&quot; the review by the &quot;reader from Pittsburgh&quot;  called &quot;one good chapter&quot; which gave him 3 stars. Furthermore,  Radin wrote a review for himself and got 5 stars for free in this way. My  review (and I guess that many others) were not published several times.  This type of &quot;selective reporting&quot; occurs not only when people  judge this book but also in paranormal phenomena generally and the book  does not take this dishonesty into the account at all and treats  uncritically the claims by people who really wish paranormal phenomena to  exist.	2000-03-17

Instead of buying this brainwashing book, the  following notes are recommended to be read.<br />Did a Global Flood Form the  Fossil Record?<br />The first hypothesis considered by scientists was that the  global flood described in Genesis accounted for the geological column and  fossil record. Indeed, this explained the presence of fossil sea shells  high in the Alps. However, as early as 1757, James Parsons and others  attempted to deduce the season of the Flood from fossils. If spring,  flowers and young fruit should predominate, mature fruit and nuts if fall.  Alas, both were found. It was suggested that mature fruit had been mixed in  from the tropics, but if so, then land and ocean animals should be mixed  together as well. In fact, they are found in separate deposits, except for  some land organisms that floated out to sea. These and other difficulties  led scientists to accept the uniformitarian geology proposed by James  Hutton (Theory of the Earth) and Charles Lyell (Principles of  Geology).<br />The ICR model (presented in this book) is simply the same old  flood theory, and it, too, fails to explain basic facts. For example, if  all species were created at one time before the flood, fossils deep in the  geological record (early in the flood) should be identical to later forms.  Extinctions might be allowed, but no new productions. Of course, the fossil  record shows both extinctions and creations, with increasingly unfamiliar  animals the deeper you go. The 19th century creationist geologist Georges  Cuvier proposed a number of successive creation events to account for this.  The present author Henry Morris, director of the ICR, proposed in the book  that the appearance of progressive change was explained by (1) elevation of  habitat, (2) resistance to gravitational settling in the flood waters, and  (3) ability to flee the floodwaters. However, this predicts that porpoises  and ichthyosaurs, both fully-aquatic air-breathing animals of the same  size, shape, and density, living in the same habitat, should be found as  fossils in the same strata. In fact, there is a series of transitional  forms through Mesozoic deposits leading to ichthyosaurs, overlaid by  Cenozoic deposits containing a series of forms leading to porpoises.  Countless other specific tests are failed by the flood hypothesis, but  passed by uniformitarian geology. <br />(Comment by George S.Bakken, Indiana  State University.)	2000-02-06

The author instead follows a different route. He  does a masterful job of deriving the electroweak theory by adding more  fields and terms one after another in order to maintain the tree unitarity,  i.e. a sufficient power law decrease of various tree amplitudes with the  energy. This leads to the electroweak theory in the physical gauge without  any recourse to the gauge principle. It is easy for the reader to  appreciate the logic, the experimental and/or theoretical inevitability,  and the physical principles behind the construction that ultimately leads  to the electroweak theory.	2000-02-02
