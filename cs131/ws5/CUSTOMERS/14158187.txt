If an ordinary worldly-minded person was to read this book, there would only be two extreme reactions. One would feel shocked and disgusted while the other would be filled with deep admiration for this class of human beings. I belong to the latter!    While reading this book, I felt a great shift of my consciousness to a higher plane. It was as if most of the sadhus were blessing me and were aware that I was reading about their fascinating way of life. It is definitely light years away from the modern world! The pictures of these holy men were simply breath-taking and the authors objective view (filled with subtle humour) of these sadhus is amazingly filled with reverence and a deep understanding of Hindu philosophy.    If one were to visit India, he/she must pay a visit to these holy men. That is the REAL India!	2005-08-14

Book 1 is \\"Mysticism Unlocked\\", book 2 is \\"Babaji's Masterkey to All Ills\\" and book 3 is \\"Babaji's Death of Death\\". Each book has a detailed introduction on how the author (V.T. Neelakantan) struggled to bring these writings to print with the help of Babaji. His dialogs with the immortal Master shows the readers that Babaji is not a myth but a great soul. Babaji is also mentioned in the \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" (by Paramahansa Yogananda).    This compilation also tells the reader the reasons for the formation of another kriya organization (Babaji's Kriya Yoga Order of Acharyas) in addition to the already existing Self-Realization Fellowship. This Order acts as a complement to SRF and it is NOT a rival organization. It also shows us that Babaji has no wish for any organization to claim a monopoly over His form and name.    This work is written after the publication of \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" and after Yogananda's Mahasamadhi.(a yogi's conscious exist from his physical body) Thus Babaji has decided to reveal more details about his birth and life to the general public after his disciple's exit from this world. Even Yogananda was unable to disclose when his Paramguru was born to the general public. Here Babaji talks about his early life and place of birth.    Lastly, all SRF members should read this book if they desire to know more about their paramguru. This work is truly a classic and it is written in a literary style.	2005-08-09

It is an excellent introduction to the field of astronomy. It really helps the reader to comprehend fundamental astronomy concepts and much more complicated scientific theories and explanations.    All fundamental concepts of astronomy are covered, from the big bang to spotting the 88 constellations. It even gives the reader an explanation of antimatter and dark matter (topics which are generally discussed in quantum physics). On top of this, this book gives the reader more references on the various websites dealing with astronomy.     In summary, I would deeply recommend this book to all beginners to the topic of astronomy.

It goes deep into the various aspects of karma, but each aspect of karma is being commented briefly. This is just not enough in dealing with such a deep spiritual topic.

This book is definitely an ESSENTIAL reading for all philosophers, evolutionists, scientists and rational human beings. It basically takes on a new approach to the problem of meaninglessness and seemingly random events in our universe. In short, this work is an all out attack against nihilistic philosophy AND absolute philosophy. It condemns a rigid approach to religion as well as in science in a very sophisticated yet simple style of writing.    This book in fact engages any deep thinking reader to further define his/her thoughts and reasoning capabilities on subjects such as evolution, religion and purpose of existence. This work reveals that the author is more intellectual (and intelligent) than any other famous philosophers of the past. For example, Walters' unsympathetic attack on Sartre shows the reader that Sartre was actually an \\"intelligent idiot\\"! In fact, this pseudo intelligence is quite common among western philosophers and scientists.    In summary, this book MUST be read by any aspiring philosophers and students of evolutionary biology. It WILL strengthen the faith of any scientist or evolutionist.	2005-07-18

The struggles they went through and eventually attaining Self-Realization is truly a source of inspiration for all those souls embarking on the spiritual path. It gives new hope to thousands of people who have decided to lead a holy life of Truth and Wisdom and are having problems in their spiritual quest. Most of the common problems faced by spiritual novices can be answered in this small and humble book.    In the last chapter of this priceless book, the author gives an in-depth perspective on the teachings of this book. This is indeed a valuable guide to all those deciding to do yoga and other spiritual practices.    In short, the only complaint I have about this book is that it is too short! 181 pages of wisdom does not reveal the true nature of spiritual \\"giants\\" who had lived in the Himalayas.

Firstly, I wish to state that I enjoyed this DVD about the life of Yogananda completely. It tells us the difficulties Yogananda faced in establishing his foothold on American soil. The narration is superb in quality but fails to bring the viewer to a deeper understanding on Yogananda's early mission in America.    Thus the only negative point I feel about this DVD is that it is too short and brief. The 30-minute viewing time does not justify the price of this DVD. Furthermore it has no extras or useful additional tidbits on the early life of Yogananda in America.	2005-07-11

This book by Goswami Kriyananda describes the philosophies and disciplines of yoga. But this book does NOT reveal the actual technique of Kriya Yoga which is provided in the Self-Realization Fellowship lessons. And this is actually a positive situation because it forces the sincere student to spent his money and develop his patience in receiving the actual technique of Kriya Yoga. It separates the sincere students from those who wish to receive this ancient science for curiosity sake. Thus the actual technique should NEVER be revealed to the general public.<br /><br />But this book gives the reader an exhaustive description on hatha yoga and the benefits of practicing the postures correctly. It also discourages people with poor health from doing the more advanced postures. This shows that Swami Kriyananda is not a megalomaniac when it comes to yoga, but advices the student to do his meditations and postures without any strain or discomfort.<br /><br />The reason I gave this book a 4 rating and not a 5 is that the author failed to deeply emphasis on the importance of devotion in the spiritual path. At most, he gave a scant report on the path of devotion by the spiritual seeker. Paramhansa Yogananda ALWAYS emphasized on the importance of devotion to God in his writings. Thus, the average reader might find this book a bit \\"dry\\".<br /><br />In short, sincere seekers who wish to know the Truth should turn to other reading materials in the market today. Books such as the \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0941848094 The Christ Consciousness]]\\" will provide much inspiration on the novice's spiritual quest for Nirvana. For those interested in developing their intellect and body only, this book is a sufficient reading material.	2005-07-10

(this will no doubt engage the interest of the evolutionists!) Part 4 deals with the forces of good and evil. And last but not least, Part 5 deals with the author's vision for his organization.    Self-Realization members who desire to know more about their Guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, should read this book. This book also contains information which is immensely useful to evolutionists and to UFO enthusiasts. This inspiring book is also recommended to those souls desiring enlightenment.    Finally, this book complements the \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" by Paramhansa Yogananda and the \\"[[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]]\\" books by Neale Donald Walsh. In Conversations with God, God reveals to us that Man did not directly come from beasts and our genes were combined with the genetic code of Highly Evolved Beings. (HEBs or Highly evolved aliens) This message is beautifully emphasized in \\"Christ Consciousness\\".     In short, I would like to invite the reader to impartially analyze the messages contained in this book. Our Earthly future is one of hope and NOT of a catastrophic ending.	2005-07-09

Being a soccer fan of the club Manchester United for 15 years, this book is truly a revealing account inside the mind of one of the greatest soccer managers of British Football.    This autobiography shows how a seemingly ordinary man was able to achieve phenomenal success in his managerial career. Alex HATES to be on the losing side and this is a major motivation for him to achieve success constantly on the pitch and on his personal life.    I would love to recommend this book to all Manchester United fans as well as sports psychologists and people working in a competitive environment. To achieve success (in whatever field), one MUST have confidence in his/her own ability and take on the world like a soldier on the battlefield. People with low self-esteem should read this book to bring out their own competitive nature.

All those souls who doubt that it is possible to talk with God should read this book and apply the basic principles contained here.    Throughout history, there were many souls who revealed that it is possible to have a conversation with God. Recent examples are Yogananda, Neale Donald Walsh and other saints in India. An atheist may view this book with scorn but if one follows the teachings here, the so-called atheist would be having a daily conversation with God! God is indeed the most approachable and understanding being in the cosmos and by studying the life of the author, one will find that Yogananda was ALWAYS in conversation with the \\"Soul of souls\\".

As a member of Self-Realization Fellowship for eight years and being initiated into the ancient science of kriya yoga, reading this book has increased my spiritual practices for God greatly. However, Norman Paulsen's definition of angels is inaccurate within the glossary section of this inspiring, sincere and comforting book. I will get to this point later in my review.    Those souls who are beginning to desire for God, this book acts like a starter guide into the inner world of love and wisdom. The paintings and drawings are very beautifully done and one can't help but feel inspired by the pictures. Paulsen's \\"Eightfold Path\\" of living is very similar to the Buddhist philosophy of attaining Enlightenment.     But I would not recommend this book to new members of SRF or to those fiercely loyal to the direct teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda. The reason is because there are a few fundamental differences between Paulsen's organization and SRF. The kriya technique given in this book is a bit different from the kriya technique I received from SRF six years ago. Those souls interested in the teachings of Yogananda should read the \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" and receive the meditation technique from SRF.    However, it is inappropriate to criticize the work Paulsen is trying to do here. His Solar Logas Foundation acts as a complement (and not as a rival) to SRF. Even Yogananda gave a few hints to some of his disciples, stating that \\"some of you would go on to create new centers, independent from SRF\\".(Ananda society is another example)    Coming back to Paulsen's definition of angels, he wrote (and I quote) \\"Those souls from the body of Christ that have NEVER taken human form. They are the immortal sons and daughters of God NEVER born of women, but residing as an angel CONTINUALLY\\". This description brings forth profound philosophical and spiritual problems. For example, by stating that angels had NEVER taken human form before, then God must be the most unfair being in the cosmos. Why did God made us humans (with all the imperfections added) and the angels given perfect attributes for eternity? Even Jesus had to work his way up towards perfection (through numerous births). Angels are actually beings who had WORKED their way up towards the evolution ladder. Thus ALL humans are potential angels and ALL angels have the potential to become avatars. Christ was actually an avatar (a spiritual state HIGHER than that of even angels) and throughout the New Testament there are references of angels bowing down at the precence of Christ. Lahiri Mahasaya also had the similar experience of angels praying to him.(in the [[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]-Chapter 31)    In short, I would recommend this book only to souls beginning in their quest for liberation. For other spiritual seekers, they can afford to give this inspiring book a miss.	2005-06-29

If one wants to understand the basic philosophy of Hinduism and the other religions, this book is a MUST have. Each page of this book is filled with divine and impartial wisdom. Kriyananda also gives the reader one of the most clearest definitions of an \\"Avatar\\". For example, he states that Christ had to work his way up towards perfection (just like all of us) and once attaining full liberation, Jesus chose to come back into the physical universe as a \\"divine incarnation of God'. Nowhere is this concept stated more clearly. Other books only gives a brief definition of an \\"Avatar\\".    Kriyananda has also been able to strictly keep within the central themes of this book. He only allows his ideas to sidetrack a bit from the main theme and quickly brings the reader back to the core of the topic. The intellectual discipline by kriyananda is commendable. If J.Donald Walters was to dedicate his life to philosophy (instead of monkhood), he would definitely become one of the greatest intellectual giants of our time. His ideas would shake the very core of fundamentalist religious beliefs, creating uproar and praises alike.    But Mankind is not ready yet to appreciate Kriyananda's writings. By his own intellectual and spiritual insights through his books, he has earned the ultimate blessings of his (and mine) Guru - Paramhansa Yogananda. This particular book will enable the reader (and especially orthodox SRF members) to appreciate more deeply the work of Ananda society. This organization actually complements and NOT act like a rival to Self-Realization Fellowship. I would also like to recommend other books written by the same author.	2005-06-28

When I read this interpretation of the Bhagavad-Gita by A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, I was very disappointed. His narrow interpretation was not scholarly and was lacking in deep insight about Hinduism. His claim that Krishna is the supreme Godhead of this cosmos amounts to a pure lack of spiritual inner realization by the swami. People of other faiths who read this book will be filled with a lack of understanding of the REAL essence of Hinduism. This interpretation also revels that the swami had yet to even reach the spiritual state of \\"Jivan Mukhti\\".

When one compares these two interpretations, a scholarly mind would be able to discern the major differences between these two works.     Nevertheless, Swami Prabhupada was a very sincere soul, lacking in divine wisdom.

This book is divided into 14 steps and each step is further divided into 7 subjects. The subjects are philosophy, yoga postures, breathing, routine, healing, diet and meditation. This enables the reader to understand the philosophy and purpose of the yoga postures more deeply. The only complaint I have about this book is that it was unable to go into a deeper detail about the yoga postures! But I guess that the author was forced to keep his book \\"short\\" because of space constraints.    The author's guru, Paramhansa Yogananda (who is also my divine guru) gave little emphasis on hatha yoga and more emphasis on kriya yoga. This is understandable because Yogananda simply did not have the time to dive deeper into the practices of hatha yoga. When J. Donald Walters told his Guru that there is nothing much more to write about, our Guru told him \\"There is MUCH MORE to be written!\\" Thus kriyananda has been following his Guru's advice and has written over seventy books which compliments Yogananda's teachings.    It is a grave mistake to think that the books published by SRF is the ONLY true teachings of Yogananda. This will undoubtedly lead to dogmatism. Books by Kriyananda, Norman Paulsen, Roy Eugene Davis and other disciples of Yogananda complements the books published by SRF. Yogananda never intended SRF to be an exclusive sect and Kriyananda(who is a very sincere disciple) has taken the teachings of Yogananda to a deeper level.     This book is highly recommended to those who are interested in living a more spiritual life and are not recommended to people who are filled with hatred over the author. SRF students who are open-minded, would find this book useful for their own spiritual development.	2005-06-26

This work revels the core of Gandhi's ideals of politics, religion, attitude towards women and constant self-improvement. A truly inspiring work of ideas and metaphysical beliefs.    However, this also revels that Gandhi has not reached the state of divine perfection yet. Although his spiritual state was higher than even most \\"jivan mukthas\\", he had not attained the state of \\"param muktha\\" yet. (A definition of these two terms can be found in the \\"[[ASIN:0876120834 Autobiography of a Yogi]]\\" by Paramhansa Yogananda in chapter 33) If Gandhi's spiritual state was of a \\"param muktha\\", India would not have been separated into Pakistan and Bangladesh.

In this beautiful book, Paramhansa Yogananda revels to Durga that he was Arjuna in a distant incarnation and Saint Lynn was one of his brothers in that era. This explains why Yogananda and Saint Lynn were very close to each other in this period of existence. Durga was also from India in her last incarnation, serving her Guru in the Himalayas in Yogananda's most recent incarnation on this planet. Durga also states that Saint Lynn was a great yogi in his most recent incarnation. In addition to these information, Durga wrote that Sri Yukteswar was the Guru of Yogananda by PROXY in this birth. Yogananda's REAL GURU is the Great Mahavater Babaji. Durga states that Babaji was Krishna in his previous birth and Krishna was the guru of Arjuna.    These tiny bits of information have profound implications to every thinking person. This shows that reincarnation is a definite fact and it explains why some souls are drawn into the Indian way of life in America. This is because these souls were born in India before and in this life, they were naturally prepared to search for Truth by accepting Yogananda as their Eternal Guru.    Durga Ma was also a very forgiving person. She never criticized Swami Dhirinda and Nerode for betraying their Guru and Yogananda behaved likewise. Her unceasing service to Saint Lynn and to her Guru is commendable and it is a pity that SRF failed to give proper acknowledgments to Durga Ma's services.    In short, this book is a very inspiring piece of work. Although there are some repetitions, this book is a valuable addition to the Yogananda's disciples all over the world.	2005-06-16

The spiritual interpretation of \\"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\\" by Paramahansa Yogananda reveals to the reader the depth of Yogananda's spiritual understanding and attainment. Yogananda interprets the poems in a very esoteric manner which leaves all sincere readers on the spiritual path breathless with admiration and veneration for Omar Khayyam.     Yogananda's commentaries on these poems will bring every scholar on mystical Islam to shame. His depth of understanding on Sufism is a welcome diversion of Yogananda's main spiritual books. Yogananda's main goal was to show the unity of Hinduism and Christianity to the West. But this book clearly shows to the world that Yogananda DID NOT neglect the second most popular religion of this primitive earth - that is Islam.     The illustrations are amazingly beautiful with a touch of Islamic art. But it is the interpretations of the poems that this book shines out. There are three levels of interpretations of each poem. The word for word translation; the practical application of the poem and last but certainly not the least, the deeper spiritual meaning and application of the poems.    Lastly I would love to recommend this piece of timeless art to all the Muslims in this sordid world. The reason is because this book shows the reader the deeper aspect of Islam - which is Sufism. Muslim mystics like Rumi and Khayyam are dangerous to orthodox Muslims because these mystics have already realized Allah and are beyond the mundane rituals of basic Islam. Their state of spiritual attainment is similar to that of Yogananda, Jesus, Buddha, Ramakrishna, Sai Baba, and so on.     Thus no one is in a better position than Yogananda (except for those souls who have God realization), to interpret these poems the way Khayyam had intended it to be understood. I would also like to recommend other books about Sufism which would compliment this book beautifully.	2005-06-12

Where else would one know who was the champions of Fiji in 1985? It is a pity that the author was unable to update the soccer statistics for the 21st century. In the 10 years since this edition was published no encyclopedic soccer books have managed to match the sheer size and volume of this work. This book can be best described as the 'Bible\\" of soccer knowledge.    I would strongly recommend this book to all the soccer fanatics who treasure data and statistics in the world of football. To the passive fans however, this book is not to be recommended because it lacks any illustrations. This monumental work was researched for the HARDCORE fans of this beautiful game. My only wish is that a similar book of this depth would enter the market soon.     In the introduction, Oliver promised to expand his work in future editions. But I have yet to see any new editions coming into the market. I believe that this was his last work and his commitment to the game would be missed greatly.	2005-05-05

As a member of SRF and a disciple of Yogananda I wish to state that my Guru failed to emphasis the hardships of leading a saintly life for the average man in his utopian autobiography. (the reason could be that he did not wish to discourage the western devotee in living the spiritual life) That is why I feel that this book deserves a 4 star rating, not a 5.<br /><br />However I would recommend this book to all the atheists and orthodox Christians. Yogananda proves very clearly that God has no religion and the basic purpose of all creation is to achieve complete consciousness of God. The part I love about this book is about the resurrection of my paramguru Sri Yukteswar. Sri Yukteswar revealed the complete mysteries of life after death to the author. This is one of the most inspiring chapters of this book as it basically explains the seemingly ''unfairness'' of the lives of men. This shows that life is not of a random chance but that one is solely responsible for his own future and evolution.<br /><br />Yogananda also tells us about the lives of other saints he had met during his earthly incarnation. However there is a minor oversight in his meetings and experiences with saints. My Guruji failed to give a more in depth analysis on the hardships of them living a spiritual life. His descriptions of bliss and joy in the spiritual path is authentic. But he did not describe in great detail the sacrifices needed for the devotee to overcome temptation and attain Nirvana. He also had a negative view on sex (a common view shared by most eastern saints).<br /><br />I feel that Yogananda himself did not suffer much in his last incarnation because he was already a yogi in his previous birth. In that life he had already attained a high spiritual state. But for the common man, I wished that he had provided in greater detail on HOW one has to face many obstacles on the path of spiritual existence. Perhaps he did not want to discourage the westerner on living a Christlike life. I would also recommend other books such as \\"How I became a disciple of Babaji\\" by M. Govindan and \\"Meditation and Spiritual Life\\" by Swami Yatiswarananda.  A spiritual existence is not for weaklings and real religion is NO JOKE! The sacrifices and many heartbreaks of this world will be experienced by all sincere seekers of Truth. Yogananda also shows us that the path of a Truth seeker has ample rewards. When the goal of life is reached the soul will never have to experience the hell of being separated from God. In a nutshell, the purpose of life is God-Realization.<br /><br />However, in the \\"[[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]]\\" series by Neale Donald Walsch, God states that it is up to the 'perfected' soul to be separated from Her temporarily again; once that soul reaches Nirvana. He states that the attainment of liberation is just only the beginning of an infinite possibilities for growth. Thus, the process to perfection is never complete but an unending journey to bliss and wisdom. One can only wonder; is it possible to enter into a state which is BEYOND perfection? A state BEYOND Nirvana? A state BEYOND liberation? The thought of it is simply mind-boggling!<br /><br />In short, this book is highly recommended to every Truth seeker; not just for atheists and orthodox Christians. Although it fails to give a complete picture on what is needed to attain enlightenment, this is a book which brings out the optimistic nature in myself and suppresses the pessimistic ego.

This book revels the unlimited potential of human evolution.It shows that the current human development is at its infancy and it is very possible to achieve immortality with the human body.     To prove my point I would like to recommend other inspiring books such as the ''conversations with God series'' by Neale Donald Walsch which clearly states that the human body is designed to exist for eternity. That book also revels that our current physical, spiritual, intellectual and technological development is at its infancy compared to other civilizations in the universe.    There is a striking similarity between these books. M. Govindan has shown that Mahavatar Babaji and the other perfected beings are not myths. In the ''[[ASIN:0399153292 The Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)]]'' series, God has also revealed that a number of human beings had achieved immortality in the physical plane and He made a reference to Babaji as an example!    The main reason that this book as received some negative reviews is because the readers themselves do not believe in their own divinity. Didn't Jesus teach that we are all gods and the kingdom of heaven is within us?    I highly recommend this book for those who wish to improve themselves in their thoughts, words and deeds. This book shows that nothing is impossible to achieve.	2005-05-04

On the surface, this book may seem very simple to understand for the average child and adult. However if one goes deeper into this reading, the reader would have the realization that life is perfect the way it is. But this book does not answer the most fundamental question of all- Why is God, God and why do we have to be separated from Her bliss while God has the conscious of bliss All Ways?    Did we as a part of the sum total of God, chose to be individualized and the part that is God chose not to enter the world of relativity? God seems to be enjoying Her existence without having to experience the opposite of goodness while we HAVE to experience the bad to realize the perfection in ourselves. Does this make us more courageous than God? We had the guts to come down from bliss while God chose to reside in bliss by always remembering how GREAT HE Is. In Hindu philosophy this part of God is called Brahman. He is in the absolute state for eternity. When the cosmos is created, Brahman remains in bliss while 'some' parts of Him is thrown into the universe.Is this fair?    However, when I read the book without a 'questioning' mind this book is innocent, childlike, mesmerizing and beautiful to read, admire and inspiring. In fact it answers almost all basic philosophical questions such as why Jehovah permits evil. It also shows that Allah is indeed loving and understanding.    The illustrations are heavenly to watch and this book brought out the child in me. A highly recommended book for children and pessimists alike!	2005-05-02
