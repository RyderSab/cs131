It caught me on the first page and held me until the last. <br />It must be every ME's nightmare come true---finding that a body in the cold storage is that of a live person. I can only imagine the shock. This story follows this \\"dead\\" person as she becomes almost savage-like. It's several stories in one----illegal immigrants from Russia entering the US for prostitution and the government's involvement. It intertwines and keeps you on your toes to figure out the bad guys versus the good guys. And then there's the hostage situation with a woman cop in labor with her first child-----adding another drama to the already action packed story. <br />You'll get nothing else done but read this exciting book. But it's worth the ride. An exciting story from beginning to end.	2005-10-01

I lost a lot of sleep and the dirty wash piled up while I was reading this. I was beginning to think I knew who \\"Blue\\" was but was wrong over and over again---as the twists continued to happen. And I'm glad it wasn't whom I thought it was at first guess. Whew-----I prefer \\"happily ever after\\" stories and sure did get that with this story. Even that last paragraph----don't want to give it away if you haven't yet read this novel---made me get all misty eyed. What excitement, what sexual chemistry, what visual effects-----the snow and wind howling, the bone chilling cold,romance by the fireplace--------it was all so awesome.And the characters were well developed---despite what someone else mentioned here. It was a great read----and I will look forward to her next book as well. I'm a fan.	2005-09-16

It's a sad story about death and the impact that makes on three young children at different stages in their young lives. But it's also a story of recovery and finding love. It kept my interest and I didn't want it to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and felt the players were awesome----especially the teen age boy. What fun they all were. I can see a sequel story-----and \\"they live happily ever after\\" with the 3 children from Crystal and Derek plus several of their own born to Sean and Lily----truly a love story in the making. But then I'm a hopeless romantic.	2005-08-05

I most always plod through a story to get to the ending before deciding if I liked it or not. This book, however, just couldn't keep my interest. I gave up about half way and decided it just wasn't worth my time to finish.  I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book---especially by Johansen. Terribly disappointed. But I won't give up on her. I hope this was a rare exception.	2005-07-26

I loved the story about Ned, the lifeguard. It was the kind of story that grips you from the beginning and holds your interest the entire ride. I felt like I \\"know\\" the players and never wanted the story to end. I don't care if Patterson writes with another author as long as he continues to write fun stories such as this. Thanks for the entertainment. Now I must get back to my other life.	2005-07-26

I love his style of writing, his humor, the characters in his stories. I enjoy having some of the same people returning over and over again---I feel like they're \\"family\\" and I know them well. The stories are always entertaining and fun to read. <br />I understand why some readers would critize these novels. But it's what I enjoy reading and Mr. Woods never disappoints me with his books. Stone Barrington is always in some kind of trouble, his friends are sarcastic and critical and yet always there for him. The women in his life are exciting and ready to be his lover for the moment I picture him as a James Bond kind of guy-------full of adventure, great looking, funny sense of humor and never has a dull, boring life. <br />Reading these novels is a way to escape the \\"normal\\" lives we lead and fantasize about being part of Stone's adventures----cheering him on. <br />Keep it up, Mr. Woods. You're awesome. Never change.You have the right formula for those of us who enjoy it. The others can find another author to read. For me, I'll eagerly wait for your next novel knowing it'll be my \\"new favorite\\" as this one is now.	2005-05-01

And this book did not disappoint me at all. I couldn't put it down. The only parts of the story that were a bit harsh to read were the prison tales.I enjoyed reading the first person accounts of the primary people. Jodi's forte is developing the characters so you feel like you have met them in person. And the Indian woman, Ruthann, was a masterpiece. Even the ending, in my opinion, was awesome---it allowed you to imagine different senarios that could happen in the future----even develop a sequel for this book to never end. I would love to read more stories about the search and rescue missions of Delia and Greta, the bloodhound. And Fitz was always a favorite of mine----perfect for Delia in the end. The author also explored the theme of alcoholics----did a great job or letting the reader know the true horrors of the \\"disease\\" as well as the struggles in recovery. A great read----loved it.	2005-04-19

She develops the characters so beautifully that you can dream about them and feel like they're \\"real\\" and part of your life. And you hate to see the story end. As always when I'm reading her novels, I lose sleep trying to finish the book when it's too exciting to put down.  I loved the mystery, the love story, the single mom point of view and the humor as well. It has it all----as Diane's stories always do. She's one of the best. I always look forward to her next book and know that I will enjoy it thoroughly. I always do. She never disappoints me. She just keeps getting better and better----when I think she's already the best. She thinks like a social worker and her stories show that part of her past life. Another great read from a truly wonderful woman.	2005-03-27
US	52035237	R1JGGAQYGWLVJ1	0385338260	868077025	Impossible	Books	2	42	42	N	N	Danielle Steel is becoming boring	Every time I read a DS book---and I have read them all--I tell myself \\"this is the last one\\". But then I'm always willing to give her one more try. As I've written before, her books are slipping--as someone else has said. I'm beginning to think that she's not doing the writing anymore. It's not a fraction of the caliber of \\"Message from Nam\\" or \\"Thurston House\\". She now repeats herself over and over again, uses poorly constructed sentences and runs thoughts together as a child would do. Her grammar is terrible. And the stories are becoming so fluff and too similar that it's not fun to read them anymore. So perhaps she has finally lost me as a loyal reader. <br />It's the story about Liam and Sasha---with a 9 year age difference who break up and get back together over and over. DS is constantly reminding the reader of their ages and their past history------it's boring and mundane. It's a waste of time to read these books unless you're looking for a quick read without any substance. <br />Danielle, please write better and go back to meaty story ideas like in the \\"good old days\\" and wow us with your research and ways to capture us with the story. I miss the old style and will not read another book until I hear they have improved.	2005-03-27

Having lived through that painful part of my life, I could write the book and don't need to  read about others. However, Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors------I read all her books. And I'm very glad I read this one--in spite of the sobbing at the end. I was told our tears are salt water-----for cleansing. And now I'm totally cleansed. :)<BR>I was so shocked by the twist at the end-----and  yet it was something of a \\"divine intervention\\" for Anna to save Kate. I think the family was already gearing up for losing a daughter--just quite surprised by which one would die.<BR>I loved the way the author told this story by using the different characters to narrate----allowing the reader to get to know each person's perspective on the ordeal. There was a sense of humor with Anna's attorney and also Julia and her sister. There was a sense of fun along with the cancer story, hospital stays, pain, illness, the court room and then the trememdous loss.I was cheering for Jesse----hoping he would be a success someday---glad she gave him a purpose in life.<BR>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about real people and the trials of life. Nobody has a perfect life----and there are more familes with similar stories than any of us want to know. Not every family, however, creates a genetically \\"perfect\\" donor for a child------but it has been done in the past.And I'm sure it will be an event of the future.<BR>In spite of going thru a box of kleenex, this was a non-stop page turner---------a great read.	2004-07-11

But I was so captivated by this book, that I plan on changing that real soon.  I enjoyed this story so much that I couldn't put it down until I was finished----held my interest from the first page until the end.<BR>It's the story of abandonment---the main character, Claire, was raised by her father after her mother &quot;took off&quot; when the little girl was only 2. It's the story of love--Claire as a mother and a loving wife to Eli. It's about &quot;letting go&quot; when her grown children go off on their own to try out their wings. Every mother who experiences the &quot;empty nest&quot; can identify with this. There's a darling little girl,Kayla, who is blind--traveling with her father when they enter the story meeting Claire.<BR>It's about mystery---Kayla's father is very mysterious, secretive and we find out a fugitive. It's about hope---that Kayla is returned to her waiting mother and family------and that Claire might someday be reunited with her own biological mother inspite of the pain her abandonment caused.<BR>It's a loving story of people, the people they love and realtionships------a wonderful read.	2004-02-04

Each one she writes is her \\"best\\" until the next one comes along to take the place of that \\"best\\" to become \\"even better\\". And this one does it in spades. She's a fantastic writer keeping you interested from the first page. Her writing is easy to follow,the story line is always interesting and the social aspects she interjects into the story are truly the work of a former social worker. It has it all----love,mystery,murder,forgiveness---probably a key ingredient in the story----as well as abandonment,anger,promiscuity,regret,sexual addition,bi-polar disease---so many issues all tied up with a big bow by the end.And I didn't want it to end.<BR>It's the story of a young girl who witnesses her mother's death at the hand of an angry man holding a gun. Her mother was a beautiful but promiscuous woman who ran in front of another woman and her son--saving their lives. Fast forward to when Lacey matures into a look-alike of her mother,Annie, and the story continues from there----with the weaving of the other family into the story as well as people from her past. Diane manages to have part of the story take place in San Diego and obviously draws upon her time spent there in her earlier life.But the majority of the book is about life in North Carolina's Outer Banks. A couple of her previous books also took place there and some of the characters return in this story. Kiss River and the lighthouse become so real to the reader----you feel like you're there and can picture the setting as she describes it in her books.And the people in the story become so life-like that you feel you begin to \\"know\\" them.<BR>I hope Diane writes another story about the Outer Banks and continues with Lacey and Bobby with Mackenzie growing up in the part of the country where her mother once lived.I want this saga to continue for many books in the future------as only Diane can do in her masterful way.<BR>My only complaint is that when I buy another book by Diane Chamberlain, I get nothing else done including sleep. Her stories captivate me from page one and I just can't put the book down until I've absorbed every page. Way to go, Diane. And thank you for yet another beautiful story.	2004-01-30

I'm so disappointed in this book------I want to scream. All the time I wasted------picking it up, putting it down, picking it up again and finally able to finish it. I don't like to put books away without reading it until the end. But I was so disappointed with the ending of this book that I wish I had put it away without reaching that last page. I thought I was missing something----something was wrong with me. Then I read the other reviews and realized---I'm not alone.<br />I love Cornwell novels and especially enjoy the Scarpetta stories. I couldn't wait to read her newest book. I was surprised at how difficult it was to get &quot;into&quot; the story. I think I finally was able to follow it about 3/4 of the way through it----and by then I just plugged along to finish it. Then the ending------come on, Patricia, can't you do better than that??? All that time wasted, all that eagerness to see that saga finally end----all loose ends tied up nice and neat. And now to think there might be another sequel-----to not buy.<br />A real disappointing read------from an author who was at the top of her career. I'm so sorry she fell so low.	2004-01-19

This book, however, is much different in the story line. She obviously has an insight into the the pain of the loss of a child and the agony of mental illness. Having had a son who suffered both, she writes from the heart.  I also lost a child.So I can also identify with the loss that this mother endured. But the story also shows the path of recovery and going forward with your life after tragedy. There are other issues the book deals with. But Steel manages to blend them together for a &quot;happy ever after&quot; outcome.<BR>Her style of writing is still lacking------she uses the word &quot;and&quot; far too much as she runs sentences together. She does repeat herself over and over again far too often. She's a mass producer of stories. If she took more time to work on grammar and proper sentence structure, she'd have a much different book. The way she writes now is not a good quality-----but putting that aside, the story is easy to read. In fact, I skim over most of the words to grasp the story-----a quick read. I would prefer, however, that she go back to school and learn how to write in a way that is respected. She's a &quot;fluff&quot; writer---but the content can be fun.<BR>I enjoyed the fact that this story got to my heart, made me cry and encouraged me to learn more about the people. Now if only she'd write in better form------but I guess we can't expect both from her anymore. She's writing too many books in too short of a time. Slow down-----and continue to tell us stories that have heart. This was one of her recent best.	2003-11-28

However,her writing style has severely been defective in the last few books. She runs sentences together, grammar is incorrect, over-use of the word &quot;and&quot; and repeats herself over and over and over again---as another reviewer mentioned. It detracts from the story entirely too much.  When you read as much as I do and love to read well-written stories, Ms. Steel's style is not enjoyable any longer.<BR>However, having said this, the story is enjoyable. I skimmed this book to avoid all those deficiencies in her writing and was able to finish it in a couple of hours. Yes, I did shed tears in several places--didn't miss the story line in spite of the fast read. It's a different take on the &quot;angel in the home&quot; idea----never before have angels moved things around and made noise that everyone hears. But--it was somewhat comforting to read about the appearance of Johnny to his little brother as well as to his mother. I do think, however, that he could have also talked to Becky, the love of his life.<BR>I'm not sure &quot;angels&quot; can manipulate lives as much as talked about here. But having lost a child myself (he was 4) I know the pain of the loss, the comfort knowing he's in a good place and will be in my heart forever------I do &quot;see&quot; him in dreams but never during my awake times. My child angel does &quot;speak&quot; to me in eerie ways------songs that suddenly play on the radio----&quot;our special&quot; ones,fate-related events. But Ms.Steel went over the edge in some of her story lines. But that's fiction------and ok.<BR>Is Danielle Steel truly writing these books? What happened to an editor to check for mistakes, grammer and run-on sentences? Or is someone else-----perhaps a middle school child----doing the writing?? It just isn't the quality that we came to love and expect from her.<BR>Quick read, sad but comforting story----poor writing style.But great for the beach reading.	2003-07-17

It's always fun being able to &quot;picture&quot; all the places the author talks about---having been there in person. With that said, I also love this author's style of writing, the development of her characters and the story's plot as well.  She didn't disappoint in this novel, &quot;Between Sisters&quot;.  <BR>This was her best work thus far and each book seems to be the best---a trademark of a great author.  I haven't cried so much since &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;. It had much humor, sensitivity, sadness,happiness, love,and the dysfunctional families. It had it all!! I didn't want the story to end.  I also hope she might continue the characters in a future novel. The story of Joe and Meg could be a book in itself.<BR>I could not put this book down--became very involved with the story and people and felt that I &quot;knew&quot; them as friends. I lost a child to cancer--so I could also relate to the pain of that disease, the agony of the survivors.<BR>I hope Kristin Hannah continues to wow me with her books. I look forward to the next one.	2003-07-03

This story has much to offer----one of the main story lines is the relationship between the mother and a rebellious teenage son. It has its ups and downs-----issues of trust and truth versus lies. Did Richard commit suicide or was he killed by the young son? Why did Mark drown? Was he forced into the pool when he couldn't swim? Why was the little girl wet and by the pool? Did the teenage boy have anything to do with this tragedy? So many questions----answers that are surprising and revealed at the very end of the book. It captivates you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the last page. It's a great read. A great ride. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to be caught up in a good book----and is willing to ignore housework, spouse, children, sleep----just to get to the final chapter. Enjoy!	2002-05-05

This novel was about twins trading places for a few days-----two women who were completely different in every way except in their looks. Having lived with twin girls in nursing school, I know that this is very easily done----it's especially easy when someone meets them for the first time and doesn't &quot;know&quot; them as well as close friends would. I found this story to be believable with a little different twist on it----Allison finding romance and love in an unlikely man who first thought that she was Annie.<br />I must admit, however, that I was quite irritated when Spencer was so persistent and intense when he was trying to get &quot;Ann&quot; to leave Davis for him-----when it was actually Allison---who was not the one engaged to Davis. I find it hard to swallow that any many would be that heavy into a pursuit of his best friend's fiance. I think most decent men would be a little bit more subtle. I also thought at the time that perhaps he had caught on to the thought that this was the &quot;other&quot; twin----after he was told she had an identical twin. I thought the portrayal of Spencer as such a &quot;wolf&quot; was not too realistic. And then to have him turn around and become such a romantic, so suave----hard to fathom.<br />I read this book in just a couple of hours----a very fast read. It didn't have much of a plot, no mystery, no deaths----just pure romance and love. A fun book when you want to &quot;escape&quot; for a few hours.	2002-01-31

And what a terrific gift it turned out to be! I was &quot;hooked&quot; on the first page----and hated to put it down until I was finished. It truly is a page-turner and holds your interest from beginning to end. There are so few books like that----but this is truly one of the best. It's the story of a woman's search for &quot;herself&quot;, her past, her genetic family. It's also the story of a death, a trial of an innocent man, a woman trying to get out of an unhealthy marriage, a mother coping with raising a son and having a full time career that takes her away from home far too much. It has it all----love, guilt, passion, lust, sorrow, pain---and happiness. Having been a foster mother, I had some insight into the &quot;system&quot;. This was most definitely a true story----facts were quite accurate in dealing with these children who are &quot;lost&quot; in the turmoil of foster care/abandonment. I hope to meet the author some day and talk to her about her life. This was clearly one of the best written books I have ever read----and I read thousands of books. It was a great gift for me----in many ways. An awesome book.	2002-01-02

After 9/11, it's fun to escape into her characters' lives and live the tale-----usually a romantic one. This novel was not a dissapointment in that respect. It was a story of true love, soul mates,everlasting-kind of love and passion. However, I feel that she has become very sloppy with her grammar, her telling the story in a casual fashion without proper sentence structure. For me, that certainly distracts from the reading. Too many sentences start with &quot;And&quot; and run together. She repeats herself over and over again------to a fault. She is writing too many novels in too short of a time------not paying attention to the details of writing. After reading some excellent authors, DS has lost her appeal. I read this entire book in just a few hours----skimmed it quickly. That was easy to do. That way I could avoid all of the extra &quot;and&quot; words. A fun story with a happy ending, yes. But a novel of substance and good writing, it is not.	2001-12-29

But this time it happened. I got very little else done during the time I was reading this novel. I could not put it down. And then at night I'd have dreams about the main characters----Laura and Christian especially. I am a true romantic.He was her &quot;knight in shining armor&quot;------came to her rescue. But the way Ms. Delinsky told the story, it was done in such a way that you were unable to put the book down, unable to go to sleep at night, unable to stop thinking about the story----the betrayal, the hurt, the strength in a woman---so many facets of this story. I truly loved the book. I hated to see it end, even though I can now get work done---finally. It's a story that will stay with me forever. This was a novel. However, it's a story that has been true in real life. And for many of us, escaping &quot;real life&quot; is also a dream at times. Maybe we don't want to escape a crime---but to just get away, start over somewhere else, as someone else. But reading this lets us know the mess and hurt that it leaves in the wake. And that will haunt many forever.I'll never forget it.	2001-12-05

US	52035237	RXGIB8U111IS0	0688170528	990695172	The Pact: A Love Story	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	An amazing story of love and death	I have recently become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I enjoy her stories and her writing---always very interesting and compelling. I ordered her older books after reading &quot;Plain Truth&quot;. And I'm so glad I did. <BR>This novel was gripping from the first page--I had a hard time putting it down. Having known &quot;kids&quot; who were very similar to Chris and Emily, I believe that I understood their feelings about their love, their being &quot;joined at the hip&quot;, the families being closely tied together. I also understood the painful reality of a young girl feeling so desperate that suicide would be the only way out of her pain.It was so real--and powerful to read. I couldn't put it down------except that I was reading it in the midst of our nation's terrible tragedy on Sept. 11---and found it was too painful to read about Emily's death when thousands of other deaths were happening in real life. I had to take a rest for a couple of days-----and finally finished it last night. A powerful ending to a tremendous story.<BR>I hope Jodi Picoult continues to write such terrific stories. She's one of my newest favorites and I'll continue to read her books.	2001-09-16
US	52035237	R3FAR8SK84BT6E	0399147365	873881745	Cold Paradise (Stone Barrington)	Books	5	4	10	N	Y	Another great Stone Barrington story	I don't agree with several of the previous reviewers on this book. I loved it!! I was introduced to Stuart Woods books several years ago and became an instant fan of his writing, characters and story lines. I thoroughly enjoy the Stone Barrington stories and find his character to be full of fun, charisma with the ladies, probably quite handsome as well as intelligent and well schooled in detective work as well as the law. He's a woman's man for all ages----and very loveable. I'd love to read more of him with this story's &quot;lady&quot; Callie. They sound quite &quot;hot&quot; together. Perhaps this story line will be carried into the next novel as Arrington continues in the stories. It's always a great read-----and a perfect book for that outdoor hammock or beach chair. I'll look forward to the next Stuart Woods book and just know that I won't be disappointed. I haven't been yet.  Enjoy a good read.	2001-05-07
US	52035237	R13WXKEFW2CRN9	0316666009	30029813	1st to Die (Women's Murder Club)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	True thriller 'til the end	I'm shocked to read so many reviews that give it less than 5 stars.I thought this was a great book with several twists and turns that kept me sitting on the edge of the couch--and made me feel like I needed to have my house alarm on at night----to feel safe from this killer. I read it quickly but enjoyed every word--up to the last chapter of surprises. I enjoyed the characters of Lindsay Boxer and her three women &quot;club mates&quot;. I hope they're in subsequent books.  My only disappointment was the demise of one special man-I would have like to see his relationship bloom.This will be a permanent part of my library collection. And I hope to read more of James Patterson in the future. He's a terrific, talented writer in my opinion.	2001-03-27
US	52035237	R2YS4ALT7YMAWB	0385499035	515648474	The Program	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	One of the best thrillers	This story hooked me right in the beginning and didn't let go. I hated to see it end and yet I read it quickly to find out how it was going to end. The suspense was keeping me on the edge of my seat at all times. I loved this novel and thought it was one of the best written stories I have read.<br />I enjoyed the narration changing from Kirsten/Peyton to Alan to others in the woven story.  It kept my interest as the main character, Kirsten/Peyton moved from the point of her husband's murder to Boulder, Co into the Witness Protection Program. There was always something happening to her and others----never boring. When Kristen/Peyton was the narrator, there was such a great sense of humor. I found myself laughing outloud at some of the writing. It was almost hard to believe that there could be so much humor in the story of a hit man and murder. The ending was quite intense----I'd love to read a sequel containing many of these characters.<br />I haven't read anything by this author in the past----but if this is any indication of his writing skills, I'll be reading him in the future.	2001-03-23
US	52035237	R2QLM9ULW1I1UZ	1551667991	689544283	Courage Tree	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Another great read by Diane	The Courage Tree is about love, hope and trust---the kind that so few people truly experience.  It's about a young girl who has a chronic illness with a very poor prognosis--end stage renal failure.  She is on a non-traditional program of medication that only her mother and a friend support----the rest of the family alienated themselves from the mother because of her decision for the medication. The girl's father also is against this method of treatment. He's struggling with his own emotions. When Sophie doesn't return from a weekend camping trip with the Girl Scouts, everyone becomes part of the &quot;discovery&quot;------of her, of themselves, of each other------and there are several surprises along the way. Diane has a magical way of introducing the many players in the &quot;plot&quot; without confusing anyone.  She's also able to weave their lives together, adding some mystery, some mystique and unexpected endings------allowing you to get to know all the characters, to feel their pain, to laugh with them, to smile with them and to be happy for them. I hated to see the book end. I wanted to read more. But then I feel that way every time I read one of Diane Chamberlain's books. She's a master at writing about people-----making the reader feel a part of their lives----as if they're real----making you want to meet them in person. And along the way, you are not bored. There's also a sense of drama and adventure. I truly enjoyed this story.	2001-01-31
US	52035237	R1XFWM1RLPTX3C	0385316879	170822767	Journey	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A quick read	I have read every one of Steel's books and truly enjoy the stories for what they are----quick reads. I enjoy the characters even though they're not very &quot;deep&quot; people. It's the kind of book to read on a plane or at a beach---a &quot;fluff&quot; book. This story about abuse is done very well overall----but I do agree with one reviewer that she just goes from one man to another. It would be better to show Maddy not needing to be rescued by a man every time. She can learn to be on her own. And that's an important part of therapy-&quot;to love and accept yourself first&quot; before getting involved in yet another relationship.  But that aside, I also think Steel's books are written too fast. She's trying to do too many per year----she has too many &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; words in the story. She's writing like a child---and I know she can do better if she took the time. Perhaps it's because I also read a lot of books by authors who not only write a great story line but also use correct grammar and style. Steele is lacking in this----to just have a fun, quick story line. However, I read it for what it's worth---quick and easy--and will continue to read all her books for the joy of the story.	2000-11-18
US	52035237	R279P61Z3LDJ7C	0671776126	362447474	Plain Truth	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of the best books read	I grew up in Berks County, Pa which is the next county over from Lancaster----the setting for the story in this book. This was the first book I read from this author--and it won't be the last. She obviously  researched the Amish a great deal and portrayed them in a perfect  way---this is exactly the way they lived, thought, believed--so close to  the truth. I could see a lot of my family in this book---a lot of our  heritage, our German culture very much the same--including the Pa. Dutch  dialect of the German language. I was raised in a family that spoke the  same words---only our religion was different.  The story was very  realistic, probably even happened in real life to some family. I felt drawn  into their lives as if I lived there again. I couldn't put this book  down--and didn't want it to end. I guessed the ending since I knew their  way of thinking. But it still was hard to reach the last page--I wanted it  to continue. I really enjoyed her way of writing, the characters she  introduced---you felt like you really knew them. It was easy to feel like  you were there, feeling their pain, loving their way of life, their simple  way of living and their focus not on themselves. We can all learn something  from the Amish and perhaps be a better person from that lesson. A great  story, a great read. Thank you.	2000-05-30
US	52035237	R3IPPNFWO1Q9VN	038531437X	698730676	The Wedding	Books	4	57	60	N	N	The Wedding	I have read every Danielle Steel book and have always enjoyed the characters, the story lines and plots---most of her books are easy to read in a short time while being thoroughly entertaining. In The Weddding, I  found it to be a great story with very realistic people with true-to-life  stresses even if they're the Hollywood crowd. However, I feel that perhaps  the author is beginning to focus on quantity rather than quality in writing  her novels. The sentences tend to run together, with too many  &quot;and&quot; words, they lack descriptive words and phrases--just  becoming a jumble of too many words running together. If you can look past  that, the story is entertaining. Perhaps she should take more time, write  less novels and concentrate more on her grammar, words and style of  writing----the way she wrote in her best novels from years ago. I will, on  the other hand, continue to buy and read all her books-----they're an  escape from reality of life. And I'll always enjoy that aspect of her  writing.	2000-04-21
