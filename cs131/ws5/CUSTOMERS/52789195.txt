It is definitely one of my \\"too tired to read a new book, but have to read something\\"  shelf.  The new one, THE KING'S OWN, is due out in February.   I heard the publisher is not going to publish any more of Lorna's books as this one did not sell well enough.  From the looks of these reviews, they must be on another planet.  We need to get the word out, folks.  I want more Rabbit books!!!!!!!!	2005-08-31

I bought it on the spot, paying full price--and sales tax (which my state does not have) because I could not wait.  I was not mistaken in doing so.  This made my vacation overseas just a little bit better than it would have been.  I enjoyed every word.  The mystery is interesting, the people well characterized, the historical ones who were real and the fictional ones, &quot;old&quot; and in the present.  What a neat book!  I really have to read something by Richard Burton.  I will probably end up with a new obsession.  However, John Dunning is an old obsession and I sure wish he would write faster.	2004-03-16

As usual with Lee and Miller, this book is a fun read with well developed characters.  They seem capable of taking a simple plot and making it interesting because one is interested in the characters, where they came from and where they are going.  I hope the characters continue, but then, I say that about all their books. I hope they continue writing and I will take what I can get.	2004-03-13

Just like a previous reviewer, I laughed out loud often.  The puns are hilarious and I am sure I missed some.  The more you have read, the more you get out of this,i.e the discussion about &quot;Love's Labour Won&quot;?  How could you not chortle?  However, it was not just a bunch of puns strung together.  In fact, most were subtle.  No, it had a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end.  How nice.  I have already bought book two, and am looking forword to delving into it.	2003-07-03

I know the guy writes slow, but I do wish he would get on the stick.  I love all of his books, and even though I wasn't quite as enamored of this one, I still want Amanda to continue and to have learned from her mistake and get into more action and thoughtful ideas that make her even better.  I agree that I also want some of my favorite characters to reemerge, but not necessarily Arkady.  I enjoy Amanda and want her to continue developing.  If not Amanda, someone else can be introduced, but get with it.  I just like Cobb's books.  I reread WEST ON 66 often and enjoy it, too.	2003-06-23

I was one of those who found these authors way back when and kept their books.  I always wondered what happened next and could NOT believe that I wasn't going to find out.  Thanks to Stephen Pagel and Meisha Merlin, my belief was not misplaced and  the saga is continuing.  I hope Sharon Lee and Steve Miller keep writing away.  Start from the beginning, though, and read them all for continuity.  Don't forget the short stories about this universe.  Find them somewhere.	2002-02-20

I still have copies of the original paperbacks, very well read, I must add.  I kept wondering what happened.

The current book is actually a prequel and you have to fall in love with characters that you know only by hearsay in the previous novels.  This helps them come alive and is a timely piece.

Granted, this is a reprint of a 10 year old book, but it should have stayed there in memory.  I did not read many romances then as most of them seemed to involve women who were &quot;pounced on&quot; (marginally acceptable) or raped (completely unacceptable)and the rest of the book telling you why it is OK 'cause they &quot;were meant for each other.&quot;  No way!

This is a great little book about the Goldstone's personal explorations into the book world and the people they meet there.  Their descriptions of the people they meet, the Duke and Duchess, book dealers and their shops,  fairs, auctions, etc., are exactly in keeping with the tone of the first  book and I enjoyed it quite as much.  One of the things that impressed me  the most was the thoughts, pro, con, and speculative, about the internet  and where it may or may not be going and possible ramifications of this.   It is important, but nobody can truly answer that question yet.  I loved  it.  I use the internet (obviously). I live in small town USA and love  books, but cannot always get my hands on them without long distances and  elaborate plans.  Bibliofind is worth a lot to me all on its own.  Helpful  or not, I just enjoyed reading the book.  It wouldn't even be the same  without the menus.  The mood is all part of the book.  I can't wait for the  next one.	1999-06-26
