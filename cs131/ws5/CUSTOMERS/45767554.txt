This review will be short.  Like all the other reviewers have said, this book is superb.  The subject matter is extremely well organized, so already it has addressed what has been a major problem-in my mind anyway-of all of these other books.  Organization.  It was certainly noticeable in Royce and Charles' self-defense techniques, which was too bad as the techniques were all quite good in that one.  My only problem with this effort by Kid and Royce for this book is the title.  Ultimate Fighting Techniques is not exactly appropriate unless this material will be fleshed out some more in the rest of the series.  I know we can expect another volume on the bottom position, but UFT is really a book about sport BJJ with a little self-defense against punches and kicks thrown in.  Royce doesnt' address striking on the ground much at all.  And his low kick entries are very, very basic.  I am not saying that the book shouldn't be purchased, just that if you are expecting a treatise on NHB techniques this isn't exactly the book you are looking for.  If you are looking to sharpen every aspect of your BJJ top game than definately get this book.	2005-10-02

This is almost as good as Norman Leff's combat jujitsu book.  Here the production value is better, and obviously our heroes are athletes. I like this book a lot for the same reason I like kung fu movies.  Here is the secret to the ninja fighting success of the old days.  When you attack someone from behind or while they are asleep, or from a distance with a projectile weapon, you have a high probability of success.  Why?  Because your opponent can't really fight back very well.  Reading this book has helped me to understand why ninjas preferred to kill people or beat them up while they were unaware.  The sad fact is that people buy this book and its premise.  They think it is a worthwhile art for self-defense instead of seeing it as the great joke that it is.	2004-02-23

This book is on par with JJ Machado's Black Belt techniques.  Royler's book my well be the best of the series.  No mean feat that.  It deals more substantially with the stand up portion of a a grappling match than any of the other invisisble cities BJJ books and also discusses grips.  This in itself is a huge plus.  Most of the BJJ books on the market, even the much touted Brazilian Jiu-jitsu The Master Text, fails to deal adequately with stand-up material.  Royler has put together some outstanding material.  It has great techniques, great advice, and high production value.  This is a book that will definately add to your submission grappling arsenal, while refining what you already know.  Well worth the price.	2004-01-14

That takes a lot of dedication and hard work. So I really have a great deal of respect for Wally Jay.  Having said that though, I think small circle Jujitsu is really an ineffective grappling system. And I also think that it is no good in the street.  Reading this book confirmed all of my worst suspicions about this art. Buy it only if you are looking for a good laugh and have money to burn.  If not, and you actually want a good book about fighting try anything in Kid Peligro's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu series.  Or go buy some Mario Sperry Vale Tudo tapes.  Just don't get this book!	2003-11-25

Full of dynamic technique and loaded with good descriptions.  This book breaks down all of the major throws of judo while also exploring judo's mat work.  Having &quot;Newaza&quot; Sato on board really made this subject matter stand out tremendously.  This book also contains a great section on combinations, and physical training.  Any person who grapples with a gi should own this book.<BR>My only complaint is that the judoka demonstrating the techniques are both wearing white gis this can sometimes make it hard to distinguish what is going on unless you already have a practiced eye for the material.

It is horrifying, touching, insightful etc.  Indeed it is all of those things.  But in my opinion it doesn't get the credit it deserves by the more academic critics.  &quot;It&quot; is rarely featured reading in colleges, or high schools.

Of the Invisible Cities Press Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu released to date (Royler and Renzo's book, Royce and Charles' book and Kid Peligro's book) this book by JJ Machado and Kid Peligro is by far, the best of the bunch.  that is not to say that the other books that I mentioned are not good.  They are extremely good.  However, they lack a special something that this particular effort has in spades.  Personality.  One of the really great things about this manual is the insight it give the reader into the style and approach of a particular fighter.  JJ Machado has been, it seems, remarkably forthright in this book.  He reveals his very unique approach by showing us the way he does things.  The oher Invisible Cities books have been useful, but they remain I think beginners manuals (not at all a bad thing!).   This book is about seeing a larger picture.  It is a guide post for paving your own road in this most wonderful art.<BR>On the content side this book does not dwell on the basics, it is not that kind of book.   Technically it is strategy manual,  specifically it demonstrates the way you can play with the movements of BJJ in unpredicable ways.  JJ Machado is known as a finisher and that is the other thing the book trys to demonstrate, how to finish from nearly everywhere in sound, BJJ fashion.  This isn't exactly a beginners book, but I think the beginner could benefit from owning it.	2003-10-16

It will serve as an example of the many problems of this book.  In his work Lomberg claims that habitat loss has had no effect on birds, that is it has not caused extinctions.  This is utterly irresponsible.  Clearly, habitat loss lead to the loss of no less than four species of birds in North America alone.  They are, the Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon, Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Dusky Seaside Sparrow.  These extinctions offer a cautionary tale to those who would haphazardly slash and burn rain forests or even northern temperate forests.  The important point made by our North American extinctions is that evolutionary specialization can mean disaster when the local environment is decimated.  The kind of specialization exhibited by the species mentioned above is uncommon in temperate regions, however endemism and ecological specialization is extraordinarily high in the tropics.  So thoughtless clearing of the kind engaged in here in North America would spell absolute disaster in the tropics.  I am not saying that development and the conservation of biodiversity are incompatible, I hamppen to think they are.  But the picture that Lomberg presents is not an honest one. Not in the slightest.  There is geniune truth in the 'litany'.  I think it is clear that pollution, bioaccumlation, ozone depletion (not so much a problem now as decisive action has been taken), acid rain are all serious problems that affect the quality of all life.  Lomberg likes to gloss over this fact, or say that it is not really a problem, or that is not as serious a problem as the environmentalists think it is.  This is a horribly irresponsible book.	2003-08-25

There are, of course the obvious things, great writing, fascinating setting, interesting story, plus and an interesting view of a countries unique history and culture.  There is something sad and bitter about our hero, and his companions.  One thing that is utterly refreshing about this book is that I never knew what to expect.  In lesser hands this would have been a goofy exercise in boring fantasy/adventure themes and set pieces.  Not Cloud of Sparrows though, not at all.

I image it is because it occasionally ruffles ideological feathers.  This is a wonderful book that goes a long way toward introducing lay readers and interested scholars to the rich and developing field of evolutionary psychology.  Pinker is one of the great writers in the science popularization field.  His books are well researched, his points are well argued, and the tone quite respectful.  Well maybe he is a little rough on the postmodernists, and the hard cultural relativists, but they probably deserve a little harsh criticism.<br />Anyone interested in the state of cognitive research today ought read this book.  Agree with him or not, Pinker will not dissappoint.	2003-08-25

First off I must say that Salvatores masterpiece is the Icewind Dale Trilogy. That is hands down his finest work with Drizzt.  The Dark Elf Trilogy is, in my humble opinion not worth the paper it is printed on.  This, book, 'The Thousand Orcs' (which by the way is a bit of an underestimate and misleading) seems to be a return to his winning ways.  The characters have grown, they have had trials and been changed by them.  This sets up really mature interaction among our adventurers.  Salvatore is at least a writer who keeps continuity at the forefront.  He doesn't just introduce a new development in one novel only to forget about it in the next.  So it is neat to see the conflicts that the characters new entanglements produce.  What is also nice about this book and Salvatore in general, is the fact that he does like to surprise the reader.  And that is a hard thing to do when the themes fantasy novels have been pretty much done to death.  I probably need not say that Salvatore handles the action superbly.  Or need I mention that the books are action packed and fun?  No...good.<BR>My only complaint really is the title.  It is more than a thousand orcs, more by a lot.  And it isn't just orcs.  I don't quite understand that.	2003-08-25

It is a wonderful overview and reference guide.  I guess I take exception to the complaints Brian Glennon.  I think the introduciton of so-called &quot;non-judo technique&quot; can only serve to strengthen Judo as a whole.  As Inokuma Sensei states, &quot;the judo contest takes the form of a fight&quot; it seems silly and counter productive to limit the arsenal of the fighter simply to please someone's sense of aestetics.  Furthermore I think Glennon's complaint stems from a deep seated resentment that some &quot;non-judo&quot; techniques can defeat &quot;judo&quot; techniques. Sato sensei himself thought that Sambo's version of kesa gatame was superior to Judos and adopted the sambo form.  <BR>I am also not sold on the absolute importance of Kata.  I think Judo kata are far superior to the kind found in many other traditional martial arts forms, especially since it involves another person, and movement (though pre-rehearsed).  I think the BJJ people have the practical fighting side of Judo down because the art teaches self defense and fighting in a much less structured way.  <BR>Though I have some reservations about being a judo traditionalist (it certainly is not for me) I do have a great deal of love for judo, and think that all grapplers, especially gi grapplers need both Kodokan Judo, and Best Judo, as these two volumes are excellent references sure to help improve ones grappling game.	2003-08-19

So it will come as no surprise that to long time Dawkins readers that 'River Our of Eden' takes down familiar paths.  Indeed anyone who has read 'The Blind watchmaker' or 'Climbing Mount Improbable' has seen this material before.  But what I think stands out so very much about 'River' is what an outstandingly lucid, eloquent, and rewarding introduction to Evolutionary theory it is.  Dawkins is always an eloquent writer, capable of handling metaphor in ways that don't confuse the reader (Dawkins never drops a metaphor without explaining in the fullest detail).  I think this should be required reading in all AP biology classes.  It is a beautiful introduction to Evolutionary theory, that also exposes readers to the deep philosophical unease many people feel about the subject.	2003-08-13

It is hard to know where to begin.  <BR>This book is one of the best books of the past 20 years.  Of course it could not have been written 20 years ago, there was still so much cutting edge research to be done.  And of course there is more to do, but this book hopefully is the first nail in the coffin of postmodernism/cultural relativism.  Pinker is a great writer and has a very skillful knack for explaining even the most difficult of subjects. This book is entirely accesseable and even if you dislike what he says, the respect he shows his audience when saying will at least render you open to his argument.  He does not seem to know how to invent straw men, and would rather, deal with real opponents anyway.  <BR>Without doubt this is the direction the science of human nature is going, we are not blank slates, there are no noble savages, and there appears to be no ghost in the shell.  We are not worse off because it is so.  This is one of the most uplifting and eyeopening books I have ever read.<BR>My advice, buy one copy for yourself, and one copy for a postmodernist friend.	2002-12-11

If the book had been a more technical treatment, that would have been great.  It has that, but not enough.  But even still, what it did have would have been ggggreat if, only if, Mark had not put in a bunch of sillyness.<br />What is the sillyness you ask?  It is the goofy stories. I couldn't stand his little asides about the Magical Angel.  I am so weary of the the &quot;super-master&quot; stories that some martial artists find so appealing. Keep in mind that I am not criticising Master Cabeles in anyway at all.  I am sure he was great. But I think we diminish the greatness of lives lived when we begin to exagerate the reality of them. Let us be in awe of the real, not the fabrication we can easily make up.<br />At times Mark seems like a 4 year old who sees in his mentor superhuman quality.  That can be endearing the hands of a capable writer, but that Mark Willey is not.	2002-12-11

I loved this book, back when it was called Jun Fan/Jeet Kune Do the textbook.  That was Tim Tackett, Chris Kent production then. The pictures in this book are new but not as good or comprehensive as the Tackett/Kent book. My advice is get the Text Book version, and Pick up Tackett and Kent's Jeet Kune Do kickboxing book. Those are actually good. If you want to review techniques and understand alot of what goes into making a good JKD fighter. It is important to note that for that last part you must have read and absorbed the Tao of Jeet Kune Do.<BR>Another complaint I have about this book, and is by no means minor, is the way Chris Kent handles grappling.  It is quite clear to even a six month practicianer of, nearly any grappling art, except maybe Small Circle Jiu-jitsu, that Kent has no idea of what he is talking about.  The problem is that Kent does not understand the grappling range at all.  He seems to think it is a place where (after he has performed his miracle trapping) his opponent will just allow him to twist, crank, and lock him in any way Kent wants. There is no discussion of how dynamic this range is.  Chris Kent, like Larry Harstell, can perform myriad locks and takedowns in the context of various drills, I am not sure they can do anything in a live situation.  I am not saying they cannot, but the way they present their grappling, it appears that they really do not have an accurate idea of what happens when some one with skill crashes into you.  I must say that is not the case with all JKD fighters (and in their defense, it may not be the case with Kent, and Hartstell).  Roy Harris, Jack McVicker, Paul Vunak, Dion Riccardo, and Eric Paulson, and Dan Insosanto all understand what it is to really grapple.  The point is from the Kent book I do not think he could handle a white belt of one year at any reputable bjj school.	2002-12-11

Organization.  It is just plain bad.  There is no real coherence to the piece, similar techniques are not grouped together.  For instance, a better book would have grouped defenses against the stick together, defenses against various punches togther, bear hugs together and well, you get the idea.  Instead the techniques are kind of smeared all over the book with no logical progression.  There is also no real explanation of why you would attempt one defense as opposed to another.  Like why would you go from hooks headlock escape to the frame up? It is touched upon, but not as it would be in a well ran class.  But that is the problem of a book.  Specifically you have limited space to try to impart the salient features of your art.  So having said that here is why it is a good book.<BR>These are all good techniques that make a two key assumptions. the first is that the altercation involves just you and the attacker, and the second, that the attacker is not a skilled fighter.   That is the attacker makes a living (mugger, rapist whatever)with a very limited arsenal.  The knife defenses are not performed against a filipino knife fighting master, the stick defenses are not performed against a filipino stick fighter, but against a fellow who has limited technical expertise, and no real plan.  They are no less dangerous for that. But they are easier to deal with.  This is probably a good statistical assumption to make.  When you get grabbed as you pass an ally entrance and someone trys to take you away from the bright and safe lights of the streets, they are probably not martial arts masters.  They are big guys (sometimes) who are utilizing surprise and violence of action to take a mark unawares.  The techniques offered in this book are good first counter stratigies.  Does that mean it is all you should know and that it will save your life everytime.  No.  And the authorssay as much in the intro when they say the book is in no way a substitute for good instruction.  It is a good supplemental to your self-defense training. <BR>ALso to the reviewer who practices judo, the gun defenses are a last resort.  They say in the text when confronted with a weapon try first to get away.  I would further argue that fighting is your only option if your assailent wants to take you away.  The history of that type of crime (kidnapping) indicates that you are being taken away for bad things and you will not be coming back.  These defenses (against a gun or a knife) are for the victim who has run out of options and is running out of time.  Not for someone who wants to play \\"hero\\".	2002-11-11

This is the section that breaks many a martial arts taboo and discusses developing your athletic attributes the best of your abilities.  No crap about strength not being unnecessary or anything like that.  Rather just good clear argument about the importance of being a healthy athlete.  So the book offers practical, albeit condensed, advice on developing your attributes, strength, speed, agility, perception etc.  THere is also a good overview of the strategy utilized by the JKD fighter in a fight.  <BR>That is all the text section.  The technique section just does not further illuminate the message of the body of the text.  The pictoral treatment is simply a series of this is how it could go in a fight maybe.  This section fails to drive home the greater theme the JKD fighter is operating under.  Which is too bad, but hey this is a first attempt to make available in a small volume the take home message of JKD.	2002-11-11

Everyone has commented on the production value, so I need not belabor the point. The introductory section on theory really lays out the essence of what the goals of a brazilian jiu jitsu fighter are in an erudite and clear manner. Every portion of this portion on theory is great and worth my 20 bucks.  Any instructor struggling to provide a \\"take home message\\" for his or her students would do well to examine the first part of this book to be sure they are not missing an important point.  I would say that all this material in the front is aimed at both beginner and advanced instructor, as there is a good bit that both will find new and informative.  And I would have paid more money as a beginner to have this framework laid out in the wonderful manner with which it is done in this book.<BR>   There has been a good deal of complaint about the technical content of the material.  \\"This is all beginner stuff.\\"  People say. Or maybe, \\"That will get you triangled into an early grave.\\"  Such criticisms have a limited validity.  Sure the guard passes are basic, and may very well get you into trouble if performed against an advanced player but these techniques are aimed, I think, primarily at beginners. The techniques are also provided as examples of what the different belt rankings are doing, and exploring.  They are not the end all be all or meant as some rigid set of techniques to be followed like some bad connect the dots approach to fluency in the art.<BR>   I would also like to defend the guard pass that will \\"get you triangled into an early grave.\\"  You know the one in which you put one leg over your shoulder and hold the other leg as you put pressure on your opponent with you body weight until the leg on your shoulder slips by and you can achieve side control.  It works, and if you do it well (keeping control of the leg not on your should and bearing down with all your weight and keeping yourhead up) it works against opponents of all kinds of skill levels.  I will concede that some techniques are basic, and that some I would never try (a guilloteine escape comes to mind).  That is however a by-product of my more advanced position in the game.  Also criticism has been leveled at the self-defense portion of the book, but the justification for that inclusion is laid out in the section on belt rankings.  In all I can only say this is an excellent book, with much for the beginner and the advanced student to enjoy.<BR>See you on the mat!	2002-10-22

The ease with which he explains complex evolutionary concepts is a wonder to behold.  Few biologists will take the subject's guiding principle to it's logical conclusion, but Dawkins does.  There are those who call him arrogant, and so he is.  It is important to note however that he has much to be arrogant about.  It is the success of biology in explaining our origins, and much about who we are that I think most repells certain kinds of readers.  There are those who would prefer more mystery, something more supernatural about us.  And it really irks people when a scientist, with utterly compelling evidence to the contrary comes along and says, &quot;Wait a minute, look here, maybe there is something wrong with our cherished cosmologies, and mythologies that needs fixing.&quot;  Such an approach quite plainly puts the responsiblity of changing our cherished notions in our lap.	2002-09-26

There are far too many small details Rigan chooses not to discuss. Why he does not discuss them is beyond me, but he sure skips right over them. There is little that is mentioned about weight, space, or proper technique. His arm bar form is not what I would expect from someone of his caliber. In many photos his legs aren't squeezing the arm tightly, his heels aren't close to his buttocks and the leg that crosses the chest is just hanging out over the top (this is a reference to one of his standard armbar from knee on the stomach, or mount or side control). those are all important details. Why doesn't he address them? Perhaps it was space considerations, I don't know. What I do know that if you are not an advanced player, don't think you will be pulling anything off in this book<BR>That being said, the basic techniques are great, and worth the cost of the book. For the more advanced practitioner there is a wealth of good stuff in this book.<BR>Good training to you!	2002-09-26

Wilson's new book, &quot;The Future of Life,&quot; is a wonderful introduction to the plight faced by life on earth.  It is well written, and well argued (It is Wilson after all).  Well the subject matter is often depressing, the book itself manages to be hopeful.  That isn't an easy thing to be with a subject as important, and as worrisome as this one.  If you are at all interested in the state of the world today, at least from the perspective of a scientist, a biologist, then this is the book to get.	2002-04-27

If you are at all interested in the ins and outs of the study of animal behavior this is the book to read.  Of course the author's primary audience is, I think, other evolutionary biologists, it is fine for a layreader.  The work masterfully exposes the particulars of sociobiology, what this branch of biology trys to do, what it is not trying to do, and in the process expertly roasts critics of the disipline. Of sociobiology's critics, Stephen J. Gould and Richard Lewontin are the ones Alcock choses to nail.  And nail them he does. With ease even.  The work is long overdue.  It is a wonderful book, that is rich in information, not just on the state of the discipline of sociobiology, but also with information about the behavior of a great many animals.  Wonderful, just wonderful.	2001-05-31
