Neither it is important that American beer tastes like urine just because productivity of excellent German beer industry is only 43% of that of US beer industry.<br /><br />It is the first time that I truly realized after reading \\"GG&S\\", how important was (and still is) \\"geographic determinism\\". Check for example East Africa where the rainfall is greatest in the interior of the continent, so most people live there, far from ports and international trade routes. Much the same situation applies to other impoverished parts of the world, notably the Andean and Central American highlands and the landlocked countries of Central Asia. Being economically isolated, they are unable to attract foreign investment. Rural areas therefore remain stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty, hunger, illness and illiteracy<br /><br />This book is a very inventive, powerful and detailed historical study of human societies. Historical systems are complex and chaotic behavior tends to make history unpredictable, colorful and explosive. But we humans are all the same, capable of hurting, killing, exploiting each other regardless of race or ethnic background. This is how ultimately we tend to compete: exterminating or enslaving our neighbors, using techno and military advantages, spreading at the expense of other groups. This means for example, that complex and advanced society of North America Indians would have been as nasty (murdering, bringing under control, locking in reserves, spreading diseases) as greedy and cruel Europeans, if they had existed at a different geographical location. Well, the above conclusion by the author makes me sleep better.<br /><br />There is certainly need for a shorter, more condensed version (say 200 - 300 pages) for students who want a fast course on how some civilizations immerged and some did not make it.<br /><br />The most interesting chapters, one should not miss are: \\"Necessity's Mother\\" (the evolution of technology) and \\"From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy\\" (the evolution of government and religion)..litarianism to Kleptocracy\\" (the evolution of government and religion).. <br />	2005-09-22

It was extremely senseless and ad hock invasion. Many farmers, city dwellers lost their homes and thousands of (poor, desperately hoping for being paid) soldiers were killed or terribly maimed. Author pays considerable attention to Great Lakes' Indian tribes and legendary leader Tecumseh. False premises of land grant drugged Indians into this brutal straggle against Long Knives, while bellicose congressmen searched for glory. This fragment presents the utter insensitivity of politicians ordering killings and suffering: \\" \\"To give immediate occupation to your troops, and to prevent their blood from stagnating, why not take Fort Erie?\\" the Secretary (of War John Armstrong) suggested to Major-General Jacob Brown, almost as though he were planning a weekend outing \\".<br /><br />Book contains plenty of maps depicting battlefields and movements of both armies. I read it almost non-stop; especially great is naval battle on Lake Erie. Next fragment succinctly summarizes irony and tragedy of this conflict: \\"Thousands are dead, more are crippled, hundreds are in prison. In the glowing reports of the opposing commanders, scores of officers have achieved immortality of a sort, their deeds of heroism, zeal, steadfastness, loyalty, leadership, and resolve recorded for all time. But where is the victory? Here (at Fort Erie), as at Chippawa and Lundy's Lane the dead lie mouldering in common graves. To what purpose have they fought? For whose honour have they bled? For what noble principle have they fallen?\\"	2005-06-02

This should not be confused with quintessential Universe proposed by Paul Steinhardt, where energy field (coined by him as quintessence) is responsible for accelerated expansion of space. In his book professor Krauss, leading expert in \\"weighing\\" our Universe, concentrates mostly on \\"dark matter\\", but describes and explains importance of vacuum energy field as well. More about vacuum energy can be found by taking excellent \\"The Book of Nothing\\" by John Barrow.

If it had been story about amateur pugilist traveling to Kalmykia to fight locals, it would have been more interesting read. Instead we have a story about American chess player Glenn playing locals and waiting to meet republic's controversial leader, and at the same time the president of FIDE, leader who wants to introduce chess into politics and economy. The most interesting are parts where Glenn plays Washington Square Park's hustlers, travels to Princeton University Math Department to discuss relation between chess and mathematics, participates in Chess Open tournament and visits prisoners willing to challenge him across the board. There is one (and only one in the entire book) good combination to solve (page 208) and two meaningful sayings (p.211 and 215). The rest of the text is unfortunately boring, though graced by high quality prose; \\"dog barked viciously at a man who had probably kicked her once, each vicious yelp causing her to recoil slightly\\". No doubt, Hallman (what is his first name?) took a full advantage of the attended Writers' Workshops and Seminars.

Who possibly can be better in presenting such subjects of science? After all, author is a professor of psychology as well. As Bertrand Russell wrote in 1950: \\"philosophy aims at a theoretical understanding of the structure of the world: on the other hand, it tries to discover and inculcate the best possible way of life..it can give to the individual a just measure of himself in relation to the whole history of man and to the astronomical cosmos\\". \\"Timeless Reality\\" is absolutely a \\"meisterstuck\\" dedicated to reader who is not afraid of mathematical formulas and equations. Learn from professor Stenger about time symmetry solving mysteries of quantum double nature and that cause not always precedes effect. Find more: brief history of philosophy, every topic of modern particle physics related to cosmology - explained and repeated each time when needed. If you have not find easy and convincing explanation of EPR paradox so far, you will find it here, one of the most interesting! Large sections of \\"Timeless Reality\\" successfully navigate through this hazy subject! Yes, it is a popular science book at its best, loaded with names, properties and behaviors of many exotic particles. Estimated level of difficulty rests somewhere between Roger Penrose's \\"The Emperor's New Mind\\" (quantum theory content) and Alan Guth's \\"The Inflationary Universe\\" or Lee Smolin's  \\"Three Roads to Quantum Gravity\\".	2004-01-17

Yes, book contains very good scientific part (chapter 4,5,6 and 7) devoted to main topic (evolutionary algorithm, natural selection, entropy of information and Universe, quintessence, symmetry, Big Bang, \\"beginning\\" of a time and global laws of physics). The most interesting was section devoted to properties of the Void -properties that remain unchanged today, in our full of matter Universe.<br />I truly enjoyed his innovative explanation of how simplicity, entropy and symmetry are connected. Excellent are mathematical Appendices showing equations of Planck constants, lifetime of stars (to convincingly prove that no fine tuning is required to produce a universe with long-lifetime stars) and entropy of the expanding Universe. Gracefully and using just a few pages, author connected all famous people (from Lucretius who talked about relativity ca. 55 B.C.E. through Hendrick Lorentz, Ernst Mach to Henri Poincare)involved in space research and science.<br />Remaining sections consist of polemics, demystification and attempts to settle the score with so called \\"science theists\\" like Dembski (prime target), Ross, Newberg and several others.

I find his cube of theories and colorful description of many forms of multiverses (including the one having different times dimension) very educative.<br />Extra flavor is added in chapter 9 (about &quot;virtual history&quot;). It brings some humor and relaxes in the middle of not so easy subjects. Especially chapter 11 requires extra effort and figure 11.6 is missing from the hardcover edition.

In this beautifully written historic book, Mike Dash delivers a great deal of information about life in early 17th century, especially life on board of tall ships sailing from Europe to East India.<br />For many, life was dismal, harsh and unjust - we should not complain about our existence now, almost 400 years later.<br />Described events once again confirm, how fathomless can be \\"dark side\\" of human nature and how tragic and devastating can be lack of low and order in the presence of just one psychopath among even large group of people.<br />Pure horror gradually develops and appears in full spectrum in front of a reader's eyes.<br />Warning: author presents vividly many gruesome scenes of tortures, murders, executions and sufferings. Bones are being crushed, heads split open, throats cut, hands chopped etc.  Explicitness of details is sometimes shocking; and fantastic writing skills are breathtaking.<br />\\"Batavia's Graveyard\\" belongs to the same category of masterpieces as \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" and \\"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls\\".	2003-01-29

I am a bit disappointed by Robert Kirshner's effort.<br />He tried to reach the very general public using relaxed and friendly writing style, however around page 137, book gets boring.<br />Too many technical details about telescopes, detectors, cameras, plates, emulsions, silicone diodes, CC devices etc. muddle important, true and meaningful scientific achievements. Text is flooded with hundreds of names and undertakings - it makes reader tired of historical facts.<br />The descriptions of an old, new, correct and ill designed ideas and research projects mixed me up.<br />Generally author avoids mathematical equations, yet tries to describe in words many relations present in observational cosmology. This is not a best approach; presenting additional, simple mathematical equations would help.<br />Book has only few graphs and drawings - not enough in my opinion. For example: there is a referral to \\"light curve\\" method at page 104, but you will not see any plot until page 177.<br />Several colorful pictures cannot make up for all criticism that I have expressed.<br />Good news is, that writing becomes eventually focused again, beginning from chapter 10. At this point author tries to summarize achievements of all teams involved in supernovae research, draws conclusions about shape and future of the Universe, sketches plans for further research. He also makes interesting speculations.<br /><br />Two years ago Donald Goldsmith has published his educative book \\"The Runaway Universe\\" covering the same subject (high - z supernowae observations). I believe it has better drawings and is better composed.<br />On the other hand, Professor Kirshner's book brings 2 years update (albeit not that much significant). Pick your choice.	2003-01-04

Einstein's did not believe that Universe may be changing or expanding, despite the fact, that his equations of GR were telling him opposite. He introduced Cosmological Constant in order to boost his believes. He was not right, but since 1998 his constant has become a Lambda force, the most important constant of the Nature and in cosmology science.<br />Einstein's skepticism surfaced again in 1935, when he questioned quantum theory, the one he contributed to immensely by describing the \\"photoelectric effect\\".<br />Einstein was calling quantum theory \\"incomplete\\" according to his notions of realism and locality. What experiments and knowledge has been developed later, we can learn reading Amir Aczel book. Will \\"entanglement\\" phenomena become as important for modern quantum science as Lambda force for today's cosmology? We do not know it at this time. Essentially Amir Aczel's book describes CERN theorist John Bell's theorem (1966) as a tool for probing certain unknown quantum properties. I believe this book could have been written better. First 122 pages elegantly presents history of classic quantum physics from Young to famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's paper. Classic quantum formulas are introduced with a sense of measure. However the Copenhagen Interpretation of the quantum theory is barely mentioned and explained. Later book gets less clear. Many experiments have been performed around the world in order to prove that Einstein was wrong, but pictures of difficult instrumentations often lack of proper connectivity with text and adequate explanations.<br />More about entangled states and quantum information can be found in Scientific American magazine (November 2002).	2002-12-31

John Barrow's work is truly nifty and represents well-researched and designed material, that can stand on it's own.<br />If you have already read popular science cosmology books by Kip Thorne, Igor Novikov, Martin Rees or Alan Guth (just a few excellent examples - check my reviews), \\"The Book of Nothing\\" will still deliver new and fresh angle through which mysteries of quantum and Universe can be looked at. Therefore I recommend this book to all cosmology readers.<br />Book is unique as a blend of tasteful dissertations from the realms of theology, philosophy, mathematics and cosmo - science. We will discover Mayan culture, Islamic art and Babylonian concept of zero, meet and learn what they thought or discovered - Greek philosophers, Hindus, Leibniz, Galileo, Pascal, Descartes, Newton/Einstein, Godel, Lemaitre, Plank, Guth, Linde, and Penrose/Hawking.<br /><br />The main theme (regardless if this was cosmology part of the book or not) is vacuum, and more exactly: it's energy.<br />Vacuum is not empty due to quantum phenomena and vacuum presents itself as a LAMBDA force, dominating, according to what we observe, the current behaviour of visible Universe.<br />Especially interesting are author's summaries about famous question: \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\", and about origin of the Universe and life.<br />Is it possible that Cosmos always existed and will exist, or has it been created out of NOTHING?<br />After all, one may construct, very easily, mathematical equation that proves \\"nothing\\" theory  (find it inside the book).<br />Can cosmos be self-reproductive or cyclical? John Barrow and his colleague Mariusz Dabrowski discovered answer to the latter.<br />Few explanations:<br />Figure 8.2 (Mexican hat): horizontal axes (both) can be labeled as Higgs field values.<br />Figure 8.5: horizontal axis contains label for the scalar field as well.<br />Figure 7.11 contains symbol &quot;phi&quot; (zero with slash): it represents the golden ratio and equals (1 + square root of 5)/2 = 1.61803...<br />Sentence on page 248 (paperback edition) should read: &quot;..so in combination they can pin down the Universe by their overlap with far greater certainty (not &quot;uncertainty&quot;) than when taken singly.&quot; This sentence describes figure 8.10.<br />Finally I was overwhelmed and amused by many great citations, that shine along the text.

Kip Thorne's excellent book should be updated every year and kept in national archives for future generations of scientists and historians.<br />It is as much historical as popular scientific masterpiece, teaching us about life of many important mathematicians, theoretical and experimental physicists and astrophysicists, trying to solve the mystery of imploding stars and created later black holes. The author chronicles every character, their successes and failures- with precision, meticulously and painstakingly. Each and everybody is scrutinized , weaknesses and strong sides are exposed. It is a great and often humorous analysis of personalities, for example: \\"Zel'dovitch, who knew hardly any relativity, had demonstrated it using deep physical inside and crude calculations\\".<br />I have not had any problem accepting this mixture of science and history, since I like both.<br />Book starts with Einstein and GR (which book of this type would not?), but then continues through almost 90 years of many top relativists' work, John Wheeler's being the most important.<br />Thorne writes with passion and honesty about his predecessors, mentors, team players, colleagues and students.<br />I have never learned so much about scientists, exception perhaps being Guth's book \\"The Inflationary Universe\\", how they calculate, develop ideas, announce discoveries, and how they compete, confront each other and make mistakes.<br />For example, you will find that Einstein even at age 33 did not have a clue how to express his theory mathematically and managed to do it only with the help of mathematician Marcel Grossman! Also surprisingly, famous Subrahmanyan Chadrasekhar wrote an excellent summary science book \\" The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes\\" when he was 73 years old.<br />Especially interesting and dramatic are parts of the book where author writes about ingenious Soviet scientists developing nuclear bombs and at the same time suffering in isolation during the communism in former USSR. The author shows respect and gives them all credits they deserve.<br />His knowledge about life behind the \\"iron curtain\\" is impressive and he presents very open minded and unbiased descriptions. When comparing both political systems where cosmology science thrived, he understands his friends in Moscow, who contemplate that (quote): \\"one (system) is terrorized by KGB and miserable because of the power of incompetent officials and another (in America) is barbaric because of the way they treat poor and lack of medical care for everyone\\".<br />The author always tried to keep in touch with his colleagues in USSR and was able to travel there in many occasions. This benefited all of them, large group of Russian and American scientists. Book reads often like action packed sensational story where lots is at stake and tensions are high.<br />Kip Thorne immerges as a very colorful, free spirited and amicable person. He describes personal life and achievements with modesty - top notch, \\"super\\" scientists are as much humans as we \\"normal guys\\" are - this is his message.<br />As a scientific book, Black Holes\\" excels as well. Drawings and explanations in separate boxes are great and make everything easy to understand. Particle physics is hardly present (except where hole's radiation is explained) making concept of the book clear and digestible.<br />Text leads us from classic introduction to GR (the best I have ever read) through the physics of collapsing stars and speculations about creation of giant black holes arising from binary systems.<br />Consecutive chapters explain how scientists developed and created radio and X-ray instruments searching for radiating black holes.<br />Eventually we arrive at gravitational waves and quantum theory. These waves generated by black holes might revolutionize our understanding of the Universe even more than did radio and X-rays. In early 80s gravitational wave physicists, including influential Kip Thorne, started to develop interferometric detectors to confirm existence of waves. Gravitational waves when detected will teach us about black holes' properties, and knowledge about black holes will help to solve singularities dilemma. Consequently we will better understand beginning and evolution of the Universe.<br />Final chapters introduce Stephen Hawking and how he managed to partially unify GR with quantum mechanism and announce that black holes evaporate keeping entropy of the Universe in balance. We meet Roger Penrose and his concept of solving singularity by application of topology calculations.<br />Later author introduces law of quantum gravity: \\"One task of the laws of quantum gravity is to govern the probabilities for the various curvatures and topologies within a black hole's singularity. We do not really understand at all well the laws of quantum gravity and their consequences,\\" he writes. This statement reminds actual today, 10 years after. Book ends with description of quantum foam and with fascinating speculations about wormholes and traveling in time.<br />Crazy science fiction physics about matricide paradox and time machines (close time curves) had got Kip almost insane, but he survived this \\"crisis\\".<br />Overall: what a spectacular book and voyage through its pages !...confirm existence of waves.

All this happened 2 weeks before the end of the WWII on the Pacific and few days before the atomic blast destroyed Hiroshima. Ironically \\"Indianapolis\\" had just delivered uranium for the bomb to Tinian Island and was on its way to Leyte (Philippines).<br />It seems that fate was designed for unfortunate ship and its crew, making this sinking a greatest disaster at sea in the history of the USA. Moment of sinking and four days at the sea spent by survivors are presented vividly but with respect to those who died and suffered.<br />Book gets even more interesting when we read how Navy tried to find who possibly could be blamed for this tragedy and whom to punish. It looked that either many or just one person could have been accused and Navy officials chose the second, easier option. Unprecedented and controversial procedure took place during the investigation - very interesting and dramatic case indeed, that never had happened before.<br />Afterword by Peter Mass brings reader to year 2000 and sheds light on some unknown facts that have been revealed just recently.

I am unable to compare this book to others, it was my first reading purchased in the bookstore about Vietnam War. 'A Rumor of War' is probably not the best on this subject; it is neither historical book nor packed with action thriller. It is rather a cut taken from the early stage of this long lasting conflict, describing US military actions against Viet Cong guerilla fighters around Danang (South Vietnam) in 1965 and 1966.<br />There are no big battles and huge maneuverings of opposing armies. Do not misunderstand me though. Lieutenant Caputo and his platoon had a good chance of learning what the jungle fight is, and his work describes quite vividly ambushes, snipers, booby traps and other perils waiting for Marines outside their Military Last Resistance zone. And they were dying, many of them.<br />It is not intense book, not the one that would not allow a reader to put it aside and continue next day. Some parts are fast paced and intense and some are even slightly boring. The same was life then, in those military camps, days full of fighting and days 'all secure, situation remains the same'.<br />What makes 'A Rumor of War' special is, that it is as much about events as it is about human mind's reaction to brutality of war. Philip Caputo created very personal, honest and confession like masterpiece, filled with deep thoughts and brooding about life and injustice, especially when it comes to war and death.<br />In his postscript to this edition, author explains what he wanted to achieve by writing ' A Rumor of War'. I will say - he has met a target.<br />Finally, reading would be a lot more interesting should map depicting area of military operations (around Danang) was better.<br />...	2002-05-22

Action takes place on the deck of steamer Polaris, along the north/west Greenland's shore and on the ice floes of Baffin Bay.<br />This is a classic tale of survival describing international motley crew of officers, seamen, scientists and Inuits fighting for their lives after Polaris destruction.<br />Without leadership and teamwork all efforts are difficult and dramatic. Dark human nature and low morality quite often prevails, hardship creates lack of loyalty, national partiality and racism.<br />This book has an extra flavor - elements of crime and detective story.<br />Writing and explanations are enhanced by author's scientific and medical knowledge combined with his experience of living in a harsh climate of Alaska. He knows what he is writing about.<br />The story of Polaris is just another example of how little we usually know about causes and reality of current political, criminal and social events. True facts and motives stay hidden and masked to be fully exposed and published at much later time.<br />I rank this book in the same category as \\"Wreck of the Medusa\\", \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" and \\"South\\".<br />If Dr. Parry was as good surgeon as he is now a writer, then many patients must be missing his medical practice.	2002-04-03

To write a historical book like \\"The True Story of William Clarke Quantrill\\" is not an easy job.<br />I can fully realize how much time Edward Leslie must have spent to do his research in order to perfectly present life of politicians, guerilla fighters, soldiers and uninvolved citizens during terrible times of Civil War on the border of Missouri and Kansas. I truly appreciate his huge effort and will say without hesitation that not quite often reader can come across such a magnificent work.<br />This book shows that United States of America, leading economy of the world and symbol of freedom and justice, once in the past was the scene of unimaginable brutal and fierce war. Civilians were killed, soldiers-prisoners of war executed, massacres took place and \\"no-quarter\\" manner of fighting was widely practiced. Nobody could be trusted; one never knew who is his friend or enemy.<br />I am not very much sure what made me to read this book almost non- stop: subject that most people like to read about - killings, war and action, or fantastic description of the era and people having enough bad luck to witness it.<br />No doubt, I had in my hands masterpiece of a historical book.	2002-01-29

Big bang, inflation and slower paced expansion seem to properly describe developing  stages of our visible Universe today.<br />This book has been completed just before science accepted \\"dark energy\\" as a main ingredient of the Universe and discovery of its current accelerating expansion.<br />Concept that our Universe grew very early out of rapid inflation is very successful in explaining the flatness, the large scale uniformity of space and origin of visible matter in it, but lacks direct evidence and requires huge extrapolation of laws of physics.<br />But, never mind: Alan Guth, internationally recognized theoretical physicist and leading actor of the Inflationary Universe theory, writes with passion about his career, mathematical intricacies leading to his proposal in 1979 and further modifications.<br />You will learn about life, work and personalities of many top cosmologists including father of the big bang George Gamow, master of the black holes Steven Hawking and finally Paul Stainhardt and Andrei Linde - both contributors to advanced forms of inflationary postulate. They all try to shed some light on the events taking place when Universe lasted only the tiniest fraction of a second.<br />Could it start from nothingness devoid of matter and space?<br />How about eternally existing multiverses, false vacuum and gravity having negative energy? Are we living in a very tiny corner of the much, much larger cosmos than anyone ever suspected?<br />Alan Guth's masterpiece represents everything in one volume: classic physics refreshing course, update on particle physics, introduction to modern theoretical cosmology, summary of knowledge derived from observing stars, galaxies and cosmic background radiation, and plans for future projects involving new satellite missions. These satellites will deliver new data and most likely confirm predictions of Inflation theory.<br />Overall, what I liked the most was a successful attempt to explain role of Higgs particles and very helpful 3D drawings of their energy fields. Higgs fields suppose result in certain kind of particles important for complete understanding of Standard Model of particle physics.<br />Do not hesitate; even now after three years since being published, \\"The Inflationary Universe\\" is still a marvelous, definitely not outdated popular science book full of surprises and mind twisting speculations.rawings of their energy fields.

Supernova stars observations in the end of 1990s suggest a nonzero Constant capable of accelerating universal expansion and validate inflationary model.<br />How true are determinations indicating the fifth significant break through in modern cosmology?<br />This work is a pure scientific report revolving essentially around two equations containing only two unknown parameters.<br />First equation is a sum: Density (of all types of matter in the Universe) + Constant (called Einstein's cosmological constant).<br />Second equation is just a difference between these two.<br />Density and Constant provide us with the view of our Universe and its current behavior. I enjoyed this book. It describes all-important practical ways used by scientists and astronomers to look into depth of our sky. Then it shows how the valuable information is extracted from observations.  Knowing sum and a difference of Density and Constant allow us to calculate value of each single parameter separately. Simple isn't it?<br />But how accurate are the observations and what obstacles have to be overcome?<br />Read about it and you will know about history of modern observational cosmology and mysteries of our cosmos.<br />Certain sections of this book are more difficult and require extra focusing power to get by (for example: dependence of peak luminosity on light curve- for supernova observation or: how the curvature of space determines the angular size on which we now see the largest \\"surfaces of last scattering\\"-for cosmic background radiation study).<br />Do not get discouraged however, just glide through these parts and author will eventually clarify most of it later, leaving you with the good idea what has been tried to accomplish.<br />I am, and I have always been impressed by careers of top world-class astronomers, their knowledge, ability to design observational methods and skills for processing obtained spectra. Goldsmith gives many stories of dedication and determination, stories about geniuses contributing to total understanding of what Universe was and what will become.<br />You will find very little in this book about extra dimensions, falling into black holes, traveling in time, strings, TOE and other mumbo-jumbo theories existing only on paper. What we learn here is only about what we perceive and deduce from it.<br />\\"The Runaway Universe\\" is a great update on astronomy and astrophysics, compact and easy to read. Do not miss it if you like to be in space from time to time.tributing to total understanding of what Universe was and what will become.<BR>You will find very little in this book about extra dimensions, falling into black holes, traveling in time, strings, TOE and other mumbo-jumbo theories existing only on paper.

US	44973835	R9JPCA0B2A75M	055358135X	298857171	War of the Rats	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Drinking vodka and shooting ?	Quite intense novel and it reads well. It gives a good idea about how bloody and cruel was fighting between Russians and Germans on the Eastern front around Volga River in 1942. Hundreds of thousands soldiers died just because two evil politicians (in this case Hitler and Stalin) set their minds on Stalingrad city and did not want to give up.<br /><br />Maybe there are better books and novels about urban warfare and life in a cities tormented by fighting; I recommend learning about September 1944 Warsaw Upraise. That is why this book was not something extra revealing to me. However, I would still recommend \\"War Of The Rats\\" to the young Americans on continent that was not directly affected by WWII.<br /><br />And finally, descriptions of Russian snipers drinking constantly vodka and aiming with deadly precision are not quite credible to me. The author must be exaggerating one or the other.	2001-12-07

Very sensitive and delicate woman beautifully writes The Wilderness Family story.<br />It was great and refreshing reading because author does not focus on people; bookstores and libraries are full of stories about humans. This book for a change, tells us almost exclusively about animals, leaving humans as a background.<br />I highly recommend this title to everybody, adults and children.<br />This type of book, I can imagine, can be read loudly in front of the fireplace to the large family gathering. Kids will learn how to love all creatures: small, large, wild and domestic.<br />For those adults having a hard time to comprehend how animals can develop and possess awareness of their own existence, Kobie Kruger delivers powerful lesson.	2001-11-20

I love and collect books about cosmology since many years. This one was a great reading. Not only about the beginning and current state, but also about the fate of the Universe in the future.<br />Time will show how these computer simulated predictions are accurate. But it will not be you or me of course to observe it.<br />Book as for today is a bit outdated, does not take under consideration new discoveries like dark energy and acceleration of the Universe.<br />I have asked Professor Adams about it and he e-mailed: &quot;the biggest change to our vision of the future comes in the Dark Era; positronium formation will be less likely, and a vacuum phase transition will be more likely if the Universe has a component of this dark energy. The basic picture however is still correct&quot;. What I really like about this book is that it gets even more interesting in the end. Explanation of quantum mechanical tunneling and possibilities of sudden cosmic scale phase transition is so vivid that I had a hard time to fall a sleep. My imagination was running wild ignited by description of space-time foam and multiverses. Summarizing: it was easy, quick and enjoyable learning about not so easy subjects. &quot;References and further reading&quot; list included in this book is worth to have a look as well.<br />Professor Adams is currently working on his new book.	2001-11-02
