The authors ability to mold images of underwater worlds and sea creatures of immense power was brilliant. Brutus  the squid being devoured by the giant eel that talks to Captain Nemo,  Goliath the great whale taking it upon himself to become judge and jury of  the oceans and Hermes in the well of diamonds. All vivid scenes that make  you want to explore the excitement of the oceans. Ah, but is this really  the Captain Nemo from Jules Vernes &quot;2o,ooo leagues under the Sea and  Mysterious Island?&quot; If it is Mr. Xavier Carbajal has created a  wonderful dedication to those of us who love science and the oceans. But,  if this is a genius who thinks he is Captain Nemo, a name he read in a  Jules Verne novel, this work is even more exceptional. With a cast of  characters like Donald &quot;Don Quixote&quot; chasing the dreams of the  seven seas, fishing off the side of the Nautilus with Jackie Fife, Captain  Nemo driving golfballs from the deck of one of the most powerful submarines  on earth, into the Carribean Sea with Titus and a loyal crew of scientists  in a secret society, out there in the oceans. Then, there is Uriah and  Kronos. After reading Captain Nemo, I walked the shore near Kirkcaldy,  looked out into the North Sea and I swear I saw Captain Nemo, riding atop   the Nautilus, the Trinity or the Avenger.	1999-01-28

Seeing as  I've almost finished reding all of Dale Brown's airborne adventures, I was  glad to discover Richard Herman! This is a superb Middle East-based  thriller with a consistent, flowing storyline and some believable and well  created characters. When Iraq builds a nerve gas missile arsenal and Israel  threatens to go nuclear, Washington politicians are too consumed by their  pettiness and backstabbing to do anything until it's too late . . . so it's  up to the Presiden't grandson, Matt Pontowski, a boyish, wild air force  flight lieutenant to provide intelligience on behalf of the Israelis, with  the help of an attractive Mossad agent, Shoshana Tamir, to prove to the US  that the Arabs are indeed whipping up holy war fever. Since this book was  written, Iraq has indeed been recently experimenting with nerve agents and  Israel did actually threaten to retaliate with nukes . . . proving that  Herman had his finger on the pulse! A very well-written novel  indeed.Spectacular flying and ground combat scenes, interesting  locales(Spain, Israel, Iraq, Syria) prominent and a swift, flowing and  suspenseful pace. All the technical terms are well explained too for  non-military readers. Altogether, highly recommended!	1998-09-29

A well-researched, fast-paced and  easy-to-read thriller which deals with the story of a nuclear power plant  explosion, caused by a renegade general intent on using the disaster to  gain him access to a tactical nuclear weapons storage depot, to sell them  to Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, members of the CIA are dropping down like  flies in a binary poisoning plot which claims the life of a British  newspaper tycoon(a thinly fictionalised Robert Maxwell) and could have been  lifted from THE X-FILES. The flying sequences are as ever, as brilliant as  Dale Brown with all the autheticity and fully-explained technics you could  want, and it's interesting to see Jake Grafton handle Russian fighters for  a change! The final scenes in Saudi Arabia and Iraq provide an excellent  backdrop to the mission to retrieve the stolen warheads, and the Moscow  scenes are also authentic and well-researched. Once again, like Tom  Clancy's CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN, it brought back memories of my visit  there. Well done Stephen Coonts, and an ideal starting point for those new  to this excellent author's work!	1998-09-27
US	52746302	R36R5GW1CCLXSH	0425120430	947264477	Day of the Cheetah	Books	5	13	14	N	N	One of Dale Brown's very best!	A classic techno-thriller! Much of the plot, concerning the theft of a  high-tech experimental fighter plane was inspired by FIREFOX by Craig  Thomas, as was the thought-controlled weapons systems and navigation.  However, Dale Brown goes several steps better. The technicalities behind  the Dreamstar aircraft are well explained without too much babble and could  be feasible one day. The aerial dogfighting sequences, utilising a variety  of aircraft(National Guard F-16s, Nicaraguan MiGs, Mexican F-20s and so on,  and the 767 AWACS was an inspired idea!)and interesting locations in  Central America are also first rate. I've only had a trial lesson in a  light aircraft as a birthday present from my ever-patient wife, but I can  still visualise the settings, manouvres and procedures described in his  narrative as well as that day. This book would make a power-packed movie,  so come on, Hollywood!    If you like aircraft, thrills, future technology  and fast paced action then this is the book for you. One minor point, there  were two goofs - the B-1B bomber is known as the Lancer and not the  Excalibur, and the B-2 stealth bomber is known as the Spirit and not the  Panther, but considering this 1996-set book was written in 1988 the we can  let Dale off the hook! The story also brings the McLanahan Timeline up to  date, despite a few inconsistencies before the 'prequels' such as SKY  MASTERS and HAMMERHEADS were written.	1998-09-21

A superb naval thriller in the same vein as Clive Cussler - i.e. simple to  understand and not too much bogging down in subplots. The Taiwan-China  angle is very similar to Dale Brown's FATAL TERRAIN, although this  concentrates primarily on the efforts of the USS Cunningham and captain  Amanda Lee Garrett in defeating the Chinese. The Sea Raptors and Sea  Comanches were an inspired idea and may one day be reality when older  aircraft needs replacing, and the idea of the stealth destroyer is based on  actual projects for the future. The technobabble is written so as to be  understood by anyone and the overall pacing, plotting and storylines are  faultless. Well worth a read.	1998-09-18

It will grab your  attention, from Hatch and Lindsey's car accident and his journey to Hell  and back to the amusement park climax. It will put you in the twisted mind  of a psycho killer and also in the mind of a man falling apart with his  vision's of the killer's evil doings. It is truly terrifying and a thousand  times better than the movie version(which boasted a great gothic/industrial  metal musical soundtrack). READ THIS NOW! The best of Koontz!	1998-08-28

Tom Clancy  can do a lot better than put his name on this piece of trash. This is dire.  OK, so fiction has to take liberties, but who in their right mind would  send a million-dollar piece of hardware, the Regional Op Centre, into the  most vulnerable part of the world? It's like leaving the door open on your  house when you go abroad saying 'come on in, burglar, steal it all!'    The  grammar and storytelling makes Enid Blyton look like Tom Clancy himself and  the dialogue is as bad as the script to the movie ARMAGEDDON, if not  cornier. If techno-thrillers are going to get this bad, I'm going to go  back to reading Dean Koontz and Stephen King, or stick to Dale Brown, Larry  Bond, Michael DiMercurio, Cussler, Coyle, etc. Even better suggestion.  Stick to the proper Clancy. Three Op-Center stories was enough. And if you  want better Middle East-based thrillers, read SHADOWS OF STEEL by Dale  Brown or THE ENEMY WITHIN by Larry Bond. Avoid Crap-Center.	1998-08-28
US	52746302	R3R4BKNRORIS6O	0425143325	685045441	Without Remorse (John Clark Novel, A)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Five stars for a superb, thought-provoking story, but . . .	A superb introduction into the shadowy world of John Kelly, aka John  Clark. From the moment he picks up the young female hitch hiker, and from  when she dies at the hands of the drug dealers, you know what happens, he  gets his own revenge. It was pretty awesome but alarming how Clancy went  into his own exact details on how Kelly/Clark builds his own firearms. So,  maybe liberties were taken and the narrative states a lot that he is a Navy  SEAL, trained to do all these things he does. But my one criticism is this  for the plot. If Sandra O'Toole, his nurse girlfriend really didn't like  him killing all these drug dealers when she found out he was responsible by  her own intuition, surely she would have left him? Any woman with enough  intelligence would! 'Without Remorse' - healthy attitude or a state of mind  from the indoctrinations of military training and the Vietnam War? Judge  for yourself.     So the revenge element becomes another Goons of  Hazzard/Death Wish type scenario. If one can convey the atmosphere of  despair at being a victim of a horrific crime like that as well as Clancy  and makes an impression on someone, is this a good thing? Think . . . I  know I was beaten up in school several times and I did take a violent  revenge, admittedly, but I never felt better for it. Kelly's portrayal as a  jarhead robot brainwashed by the ongoing war effort works in fiction,  though. Just don't emulate it. . .    As far as the CIA recruiting him for  his skills, this is an interesting angle. The Vietnam scenes of the POW  camp with the Russian and American officers held prisoner shows how in war,  people are the same. Humans, not combat robots. Just the same, discussing  each other's strategies on nuclear defence and asking themselves why they  are enemies?     Naval scenes with Admiral Greer in an early incarnation -  as excellent as ever! And we do see an early incarnation of Jack Ryan,  while his father Emmet hunts down Kelly.    Altogether, one to read foryourself and one to think carefully about afterwards - does Kelly's end  justify the means? Drug dealers may be scum, but death puts them out of the  misery of living to regret what they've done wrong at the hands of the  crazies inside.    Well done Tom Clancy.	1998-08-23

With the resurgence of far-right sentiments in continental Europe in the news recently, this book shows how much research Coyle has done. The locations featured are also authentic, I have travelled across Germany myself and could easily visualise certain towns and countryside settings. The military action is not just confined to ground warfare; the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter makes an appearance and there's several Army airborne unit action with the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter roaring across the countryside at low altitude. The combat scenes are first rate and the battle maps in the back of the book provide a close-up insight on how exactly the tank sequences take place. Coyle knows his stuff ! about real soldiering and is not afraid to show it! As for the human interest, it's good to see a war novel which puts as much dimension into character creation as it does to the military hardware elements. Soldiers are human beings, and war does screw some people up; especially with the nurse storyline. If this were made into a movie, it would be a first-rate one. Come on Hollywood, there's a surefire hit here.    Altogether, this Harold Coyle novel was the first of his I have read, and I'm definitely looking for more! FIRST RATE.	1998-08-07

It's up to Rear Admiral Ian Hardcastle, who sets up the Border Security Force, armed with an assortment of high-tech weaponry, to stop them. The drug barons' arms suply provides a good degree of competition too! Mercenary fighter pilots, anti-ship missles, man-portable missile launchers all bought from Argentina after the Falklands War and ex-Cuban MiGs! The pace is like any othe Dale Brown book - fast, furious and relentless, the action never stops and everything technical is well explained. Another winner!	1998-08-04

He is hospitalised after his helicopter is shot down, and Dan Quayle steps in to solve the growing problem . . . is that a worse nightmare than drug barons?! The leaders may be out of date now, but considering when this was written one can let Coonts get away with it. The action scenes, including the terrorists causing massacres in the Capitol and on the Washington Metro are first rate; there is always something interesting happening. Add to that political fumblings in the White House as Quayle can't cope(very true to life for its time) and a corrupt lawyer subplot, and you have a tale to rival the very similar 'Clear and Present Danger' by Tom Clancy. Only this one has less technobabble and Coonts once again relies on pacing and readability. Worth reading.	1998-07-29

The situation - Middle Eastern terrorists led by one Colonel Qazi take over a US navy carrier and arm the nuclear weapons stockpile. Jake Grafton, CAG on board must avert their attempt to discredit the US. This was the first Coonts book I read and was swept along by the sheer fast pace of it. The characters are well portrayed and not just cardboard characters for window dressing, they contain dimension. The carrier scenes are striking and realistic and for those unfamiliar with life in the Navy such as I was, it's all explained in simple prose and not too much technobabble. The aerial scenes are as brilliant as anything Dale Brown has written and the general pace of the story is in the tradition of old hands like Alistair Maclean (RIP) and Clive Cussler. If you want an uncomplicated, thrilling read, get this one.	1998-07-27

China tries to retake Taiwan and islands in the Formosa Strait(five miles south of Hong Kong? That was an absolute howler of a geographical goof. Hong Kong is at least 200 miles south of the Formosa Strait!But don't let this detract you from a brilliant story!) using an assortment of tactical nukes, fighter squadrons and Marine units. Muck and Brad Elliot defy orders (Admiral Balboa should have been on the USS Independence when it got nuked in the story! Ha ha) and fly the Megafortress EB-52 into China to avert WW3. But the Chinese have a few tricks up their sleeve . . . the EB-52 accidentally sinks a passenger ferry as the radar signature is altered and is ordered back to Guam so the bureaucrats from the White House can put them on trial.     The Independence is nuked, and the Chinese cleverly blame America for starting the conflict. ICBMs are fired and obliterate Guam an a total orgy of destruction, and 'Muck', Wendy McLanahan, Brad Elliot and all the old fav! ourites head for a secret airstrip in Taiwan - in a CAVE? An inspired idea actually!    Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf, a US sub is caught in a KEVLAR NET?! Wow! A feasible idea inspired by a similar weapon in Craig Thomas's SEA LEOPARD. The Iranians create a diversion for US forces, but at the end of the day, it's up to the Megafortress to stop the Chinese nuclear menace and prevent an apocalypse.    Altogether, a riveting, action-packed adventure that is damn hard to beat indeed! A message to those who called it 'unrealistic' - wake up. This is fiction. And a message to Hollywood - stop making awful, putrid romantic comedies and film some Dale Brown books!    Dale Brown has done it again; written a novel which does not rely too heavily on technical details, which contains larger-than-life characters from previous novels - this is great, however! Why should fictional characters obey orders all the time! Brad Elliot rules! The flying and military action scenes are as ever, fir! st rate.    Although,with the forthcoming THE TIN MAN, my ! only criticism is that the McLanahan Timeline may have gone far enough. In my view, Dale Brown might perhaps write a sequel to SILVER TOWER in a similarly space-based vein, or introduce new characters like he did so well in CHAINS OF COMMAND. But read this book, forget the detractors(and the geographical goof) and you're in for a thrill-a-minute. Prepare to go nuclear!	1998-07-24

Set around the year 2020, it details a conflict between Japan and a new nation called Greater Manchuria over a stockpile of nukes. When a suicide commando learns of the find, the Japs launch a plutonium glue missile strike on the base, and the action kicks off as their new high tech robosubs manage to obliterate US navy units sent to blockade Japan in condemnation of the attack. So, the USS Piranha dives beneath the polar icecaps armed with the latest weaponry available on its way to the Pacific . . . what more can one say.Utterly brilliant, in the tradition of Clive Cussler's imaginative thrillers. Fascinating and feasible technology (WritePads and orbiting Internet servers! Great stuff!) and submarine action scenes to rival Tom Clancy, matching his authenticity and detail superbly.

Imagine flying a 727 with a ticking nuclear bomb, a deadly electromagnetic pulse device which is wired into a woman's pacemaker. And when things are bad, it gets worse - she can't move more than 15 feet away or the device detonates . . . threatening to wipe out every computer chip in the USA. John J Nance shows his knowledge of aviation and once again explains all the feasibilities and technicalities in simple layman's terms; and watch out for a brief but awesome appearance by the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane at high altitude. As for the Air Force One holographic communications suite . . . sounds like he's been reading Clive Cussler! All in all, well done John J Nance once again.

Another first-rate military aviation thriller from Dale Brown which is next to impossible to put down. The scenario of Boris Yeltsin being ousted from power and being replaced by a hardline communist best on war is a highly feasible one considering how unstable Russia can be in real life. When Russia tries to invade the Ukraine, Moldova and Romania using tactical nuclear weapons and the neutron bomb, the US President(a southern hillbilly draft-dodger who has a passion for M&amp;Ms, Coke and Fritos . . . guess who . . .) and his dominatrix(!!!!) First Lady (who is more evil than the Russian communist leader!) dallies over a miliary response and sends in a reserve F-111 fighter-bomber squadron to deal with the situation. The characters are well crafted, especially Daren Mace and Rebecca Furness and the chemistry both in the air and in bed betwen them! General Freeman is a worthy gung-ho Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and a flyer by the name of Fogelman is full of macho insecurity when it comes to real combat . . . The flying and war scenes are highly realistic and compelling;  the first third of the book centres around Mace's secret mission in Desert Storm of nuking Saddam Hussein and his harassment by the military when he is forced to abort. The second part deals with the F-111 crew training and the build-up to the war in Turkey and the Ukraine, and the final half has intense action that's so brilliant you feel you're there.

Less of a technothriller and more of a spy novel, this is one of Tom Clancy's best. I look forward to the movie as well, I've heard on the Net about this being filmed! The best thing about this book is the Moscow scenes, the locations are spot on and accurate, I have travelled to Moscow (and St. Petersburg) myself and could recognise the street names and descriptions vivdly. The story, which is sometimes similar to Dale Brown's 'Silver Tower'(Cardinal came first!) concerns the race to develop a space weapons platform by the US and Soviets. Add to this a leak in the KGB by the CARDINAL of the title, and a conflict on the borders of Afghanistan with heroics by a soldier known as The Archer with his Stinger missile launcher as his buddy, and what more do you need? Great action, authentic locations and top characterisations. Well done Mr Clancy! One that's hard to put down, too.	1998-06-19

Some of you may or may not have read William Prochnau's 'Trinity's Child' or seen the film adaptation called 'By Dawn's Early Light'. This story is very similar in its content of first nuclear strikes against military targets, with the cities under a constant threat from the Russians' fail-deadly submarines, as the narrative states. But there's a whole lot more - imagine the emotional content of the movie 'Deep Impact' in the very well done characterisations(even the jarhead Marines have to let go) and particularly with the portrayal of Melissa Chandler's fear of the final apocalypse. The part with CNN broadcasting images of the US before the war . . . if this book were made into a movie, then I'm sure even the most hardened action nuts would reach for the Kleenex. As far as the action element in 'Arc Light' goes, it's every bit as superb as anything by Larry Bond, Harold Coyle, Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, Stephen Coonts, all the rest, and simple to understand without too much technobabble in the prose. I would recommend this novel to anybody, you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is why has this not been made into a movie, to coin a phrase!	1998-06-16

Absolutely brilliant, and thoroughly entertaining. From the prologue, set in 1856, right up to the year 2000 with Arthur Dorsett's deadly mining operations that make the slavery in the mines in 'Sahara' look like a slacker's paradise . . . add to that an acoustic plague from ocean sounding devices to seek out valuable minerals and a conspiracy to kill the world's diamond market for good, and lo and behold, it's up to Dirk Pitt to stop him. Despite two goofs(a geographic one - the Pacific lies between Australia and South America when going east from the Indian Ocean; also Hong Kong was handed back to the Chinese in 1997, not 1996, but we'll let them pass), the story is of Clive's usual brilliance! The variety of locations, especially Australia and New Zealand and further south added to the interest, the technicalities are explained in such a way that anypne can understand them and the characters once again are superbly crafted, especially Maeve Fletcher. Once again, Clive Cussler makes a cameo appearance, and why not indeed. Read this book now, you won't be disappointed. An ideal introduction to Clive Cussler for those unfamiliar to his work, and definitely one of his very best.	1998-06-16

What if a white supremacist brought back apartheid into South Africa and used any means of military force at his disposal to make South Afric make some kind of military gain? This scenario is thoroughly well explored. The format is Larry Bond`s typical format - interesting political background, skirmishes and then the big shooting war! South African forces invade Namibia to regain their old territories, the various guerilla groups in Zimbabwe and Zambia make their views heard and then Cuba, who are occupying Angola take advantage of South African dictator Karl Vorster's invasion of Namibia to pour into his country from Mozambique. The US, worried about this war causing a world recession(South Africa is rich in diamonds and other strategic minerals) decide to take military action, along with various British armed forces, who are well portrayed and represented. The action is first rate, the military hardware is well researched and accurate and the nuclear and chemical attack scenes are vividly done. After I read this book, I heard on the TV news about Pakistan and India's nuclear testing programs, and there was a brief mention of a South African nuclear weapons project . . . spooky! There's even a hint of romance between an American reporter caught up in the war and an Afrikaaner female journalist whose father is on Vorster's committee, which is done very well, better than the pulp romances that dumb housewives feed on.    Altogether, this is Larry Bond's best, equal to Red Phoenix, so far. This would make one hell of an excellent movie! If you like your action explosive, this is for you!	1998-06-08

The Birmingham locations such as Edgabaston and the NAtional Exhibition Centre are authentic, as I live in this city and can idnetify with places described. The submarine scenes are highly throlling and supercharged - the Catherine Wheel weapon inspired Dale Brown! Rather feasible. As for the Leopard anti-sonar device - is that prophecying stealth technology?(this book was written around 1980).  Altogether, if you can get hold of this, this is well worth a read. Written before 'The HUnt For Red October', but on the whole just as good, if not better, if you love submarine novels as much as I do at times. The British settings add to the interest.	1998-06-08

A very interesting sci-fi style plot here, which unfortunaltely lacks the realism of his other books. However, this is after all, fiction and the story moves along with all the fast pace of a Clive Cussler book! The space station ideas were well used. the American hypersonic plane was right out of a 1950s sci-fi B movie and the Russian space fighters were a feasible idea. A few inaccuracies - the Nighthawk is actually F-117, not F-19, but considering this was written in 1987 before they were properly used in combat one can let Dale Brown get away with that. As well as the space action scenes, which would look great in a big screen movie, the action on the ground is highly riveting as well. The Iranian sequences are particularly realistic you can feel you're there as airfields are blown to smithereens and foxholes are surrounded, Larry Bond style!

A covert American spy ship is sunk by Iranian MiGs in the Persian Gulf, and to avoid a Gulf War 2 breaking out, the President orders our old friend Patrick McLanahan in with a B-2 stealth bomber, souped up and modified with an assortment of interesting, and very much realistic and feasible weaponry. The idea of selecting different types of non-lethal cargoes(which do prove to be lethal - the acid sludge which causes aircraft to crash!) which make the attacks look like mechanical defects was a highly original one. Add to that a juicy sex sequence between a US officer and a beautiful female Arab commando(who the hell's GI Jane when you've got Riza Mehrouzi!), plenty of thrills for military hardware nuts and hardened stealth bomber fans, technics galore . . . what more can I say? Read this book now and I guarantee you won't be disappointed! Can't wait for Fatal Terrain and The Tin Man!	1998-06-07
US	52746302	RD8RTFY8JJHYA	0345384350	199284738	Icebound	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A true thriller!	After a slow start, the action just gets more pulse-pounding as the story progresses. The style of writing is in a similar vein to early Clive Cussler and, of course, Alistair MacLean, who I used to read when I was a young teenager. As far as the plot goes, the sheer terror of being trapped on a floating iceberg in sub-zero temperatures literally atop a ticking timebomb is well portrayed. The character studies are not as intricate as in, say, Koontz`s `Strangers`, but they are done so well as not to interfere with the suspense. In a thriller of this nature, this is fine. The psychotic killer subplot is also well put forward. All in all, if you like your action fast-paced and prose simple, this is one for you!	1998-05-04

My wife Sarah, after reading this, felt compelled to listen for strange sounds in the walls of our house! It`s a well paced and suitably scary novel of a lunatic asylum purchased for a potential hotel and resort development, but something lurks inside . . . when the explanation of how the phenomenon takes place comes, it seems all too frighteningly realistic! Brilliant, one of Masterton`s best!	1998-04-25

A highly amusing early novel from Cussler which succeeds in providing a few hours of entertainment. Although I prefer his later work, this one was ideal as a plane read whilst waiting in the departure lounge and on the flight itself to Switzerland. The story, despite having some contrived ideas which seemed like a bad TV movie at times, was quite interesting, and as far as Dirk Pitt`s dressing up as a camp gay goes - great stuff! Never mind the politically correct thought police, there needs to be books like this to fill the gap in the market! The idea of using Disneyland as a location towards the last part was inspired, and the Icelandic locations were very authentic indeed. I suspect the Kevlavik scenes might have inspired Tom Clancy in Red Storm Rising! All in all, worth a read. But where was Al Giordino?! Oh well . . .	1998-04-25

I first read this when I was 15, when the movie came out in the UK, and looking back on it, much of the technology of the Firefox MiG-23 arcraft has come to fruitition in real life! In particular, the EFA-2000 Eurofighter and of course, the Stealth features. Even today, this is a story I would recommend to any thriller fan. The Moscow scenes are as authentic as `The Cardinal Of The Kremlin`(Tom Clancy), the methods he uses to get to the Firefox are plausible and in general, the style of writing and grammar is furiously fast-paced in similar vein to Alistair MacLean or Clive Cussler.  <BR>   Altogether, a must read!	1998-04-25

A world recession, which strikes the dissolving European Community hard. Neo-Nazis blame illegal immigrants for job losses and rioting ensues, especially in Germany and France - a plotine which reflects real events. The US is too concerned with its own problems to aid Europe, and the Republican senators make their right-wing views heard. <BR>    When the US supplies oil to aid Poland and the Eastern bloc countries, a tanker is blown up by French paramilitaries. The CIA send an agent to investigate - he is taken out. Martial law is declared throughout the newly formed EurCon - US ships escorting the oil convoys are attacked and here we go! A shooting war blows up and escalates into some spectacular action. Despite a slow start at times and rather drawn-out tank scenes(I preferred the naval and air force and also the brief space sequences) on the Polish-German border, the story is highly convincing and sometimes frighteningly feasible. And best of all, it`s great to see the Frogs take a pasting from allied forces! The French satellites are put out of action by the GPALS Star Wars weapons, the French nukes are blown up and their subs sunk! Serves them right for blockading the cross-Channel ferry ports and ruining our trips abroad!  But seriously, folks, this is a great war novel. The British side could have been better explored - the RAF and Royal Navy are quite well featured though. (Loved the Mirage being shot down over London too!) All in all, a highly recommended read, although `Red Phoenix` is still better. The Russian involvement towards the end does reflect on the aforementioned actually. I`ve yet to read `Vortex` yet though, I`ve got it on order and can`t wait . . . Ah, well, in the mean time it`s up into the skies with a Dale Brown book!	1998-04-24

With his associates, who he disposes of at will throughout the story when he`s had all he can with them, he wipes out hundreds of people at major airports, abuses a female astrologer who seems to have conviced him he worships the dark side and then decides to prompt Tom Clancy`s brain so he can nick the climax for `Debt of Honour`! (Ooops, shouldn`t try to give clues but this book does it much better!). The President and First Lady are obviously Bill and Hilary Clinton in disguise, whilst the director of the FBI, Lani Wilkes, is just as loathable character as Cazaux with her softly softly, do-gooder tactics which somehow contribute to the deaths at the airports with her meddling ways. Admiral Ian Hardcastle, however, is a kickass action artist who will not hesitate to use force to obliterate Cazaux and his cronies! The action is swift, relentless, the airborne sequences are realistic and generally although security on the ground at airports the world over can be tight, especially in major UK airports, the story is frighteningly plausible, to be filed under `this could happen!` Well done Dale Brown!	1998-04-12

It was superb and highly engrossing; Richard Price has obviously done his research well. I loved the movie, but the book is much better. The main difference here is that Rocco Klein, the hardworking hassled cop is the good guy and Strike is the protagonist. As the mystery unfolds as to why Victor Dunham confessed to a drug-related murder the cop thinks Strike committed, the ending will surprise you no end. Well done Richard Price; this is a classic book by anyone`s standards.	1998-04-12

The St Petersburg locations are quite well done and familiar, as this is a place I have visited and could visualise the locations portrayed, but as for the Special Forces intrusion, dear me! They might as well have sent the Hair Bear Bunch in. In the real world, if there was to be an infiltration of Russia like that, surely the appropriate authorities would send highly trained Navy SEALS or SAS, whatever the nationality, etc.? The train sequences weren`t too bad, but on the whole it needed more. In some parts a good cure for insomnia! Games Of State is far better, the first Op-Center is also worth a read, but this one might be good for a plane or beach read but that`s about it.	1998-04-10

I first read this book in 1986 in my teenage years and would NOT put it down, I was up for most of the night! And even today, it still had me mesmerised in a big way. I`ve read nearly all of Tom Clancy`s books now, including the variable Op-Center series, and this one is a classic. Excellent character studies and superb military action sequences make this a MUST READ. I particularly enjoyed the use of HMS Invincible(one of my favourite ships, on duty in the Gulf!) and the Royal Navy, being a proud Brit and military fan myself! I`ve seen the movie, and although myself and my wife(who`s not a manic military brat like I am) loved the film, I preferred the book. In my opinion, a good first-time Clancy read for anyone who hasn`t read his superb books before.	1998-04-05
US	52746302	R54HUQLQC1KJ4	0446359688	227289374	Red Phoenix	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Kickass action galore!	Like Tom Clancy`s`Red Storm Rising`, I would love to give this awesome technothriller 50 out of 10! The format is similar - after a massacre in Seoul where student protestors are shot by the military police(struck a chord as it was written after the Tian`amen Square massacre), political upheavals and the plan behind the Second Korean War - this story is a blast! The F-16 Falcon and F-4 Phantom scenes are highly realistic and so brilliant you just cannot help but be swept along at supersonic speed by the action! You will WANT to be with the pilots tearing across the skies! There are also excellent war action sequences on the surface of the sea and below it. I particularly liked the Russian intervention as well; Larry Bond has carried this forward so feasibly it was plausible. On the ground, a foxhole is surrounded on the demilitarized zone, adding more dimension to the story. There is a hint of romance between a fighter pilot and a female logistics worker who is stranded at Seoul`s airport and almost bombed by a DPRK raid, which is better done than most romantic subplots in novels of this genre.    Altogether, this is my first Larry Bond novel I`ve read, and I will definitely look out for more. A smashing read with kilotons of explosive action! You won`t want to put this one down! BUY IT NOW!	1998-04-05
US	52746302	RPR3KED4THRVL	0425132625	386206966	Sky Masters	Books	5	8	12	N	N	MEGATONS OF ACTION!!!!!!!	What a winner! 10000 out of 10 for Dale Brown! I have read about his novels on this Amazon website and have been dying to read one for ages, and I was in for a treat! Sky Masters is so well written and frighteningly feasible as well. The plot about China laying a claim to the Spratly Islands was stolen by Tom Clancy for SSN(which was also excellent, but this is much better!), but the use of tactical nukes by the Chinese added a further dimension. Add a dithering Prez of the US, and a reluctant General who wants to use force to retaliate . . . Great action through and through! Dale Brown`s writing technique is also superb. He explains in a great amount of detail yet so simple anyone who is not familiar with military technology can understand it about the awesome B-2 stealth bomber, SAC, satellite technology, his `customised` EB-52 Megafortress(a fictional conversion, but such technology is feasible on a B-52, another of my favourite aircraft). All the acronyms such as CINCSPACECOM and AMRAAM are also properly explained and defined as well. As far as his fictitious ALARM satellite and NIRTSAT satellite projects go, on thinking about it, his descriptions are so realistic he could build one himself. Very feasible, launching a booster rocket plus satellite from a DC-10. All in all, a book that throw the action in yer face! I couldn`t put this down and lost loads of sleep one Sunday night, much to the annoyance of my wife!	1998-04-05

This entry in the just-about-above-average Op Center series is easily the best one to read out of the lot. The first one wasn`t bad, Mirror Image was passable, Acts Of War was a bit old hat and  plain daft, but this beats the lot! The story of Neo-Nazis inciting race hate to change world events by means of right-wing propaganda computer games based on KKK cookouts and Nazi concentration camps may seem far-fetched to some readers, but the technology behind it is described in such a way to make it easy to understand and, frighteningly enough, feasible. The angle on the re-unification of Germany starting the resurgence of Nazism is also well put together. The characters are a lot better portrayed, especially Paul Hood`s first love paranoia. But the main criticisms which stopped this from being a ten out of ten were the co-incidence of Nancy just happening to work for the Neo-Nazi organisation trying to provoke hate(come on!) and Bob Herbert`s Dirk Pitt-style heroics in a wheelchair! That got a bit too silly, but on the whole the story and the politics behind it are the strengths here. Well worth a read.	1998-04-02

Take Dirk Pitt on vacation with lover Loren Smith, showing her the kind of fishing where you don`t need a reel(nice one Clive!). Add together a Boeing Stratocruiser which crashed in an unknown water in 1954. A dead body in the sunken wreck and two missing cannisters of a doomsday virus. Next, you have Patrick Fawkes, who is desperate for revenge after his wife and children are torched on their South African farm by a renegade group of extremists. Add to that a sleaze political blackmail scandal involving the Americans funding the African terrorists to prevent all-out conflict, hidden killers lurking around each corner out to stop Dirk and co, the battleship USS Iowa being purchased and stripped but what for? As the plot unfolds, the action explodes as Fawkes threatens to attack Washington and it is up to Dirk to stop him, of course! Wild and relentless action, witty one-liners and all our favourite NUMA characters (but where was Hiram Yaeger and St. Julian Perlmutter?) we can fit in, and you once again have another Cussler action classic. Hmm, F-120 Specter jets with Satan missiles? Holographic communications? It all adds to Clive`s inventive imagination, seeing as this book was written at the end of the 1970s and set in 1988. And it all adds to the fun!	1998-03-28

The Japanese angle where the industrialist has a say is what goes on as far as the country is run(Raizo Yamata) is highly feasible and well done, if somewhat inspired by Clive Cussler`s `Dragon`. The military action is superb, utilizing Stealth technology to great effect - loved the B-2 bomber sequences! The stock market crash and the research behind what goes on behind the scenes was faultless. Also, the faulty car fuel tank sparking the fatal crash and the ensuing trade restrictions is an all too realistic situation.  As for the climax, unlike some reviewers I won`t divulge details! Totally nerve-shredding! Altogether, one of Clancy`s very best.	1998-03-26

Well, this was written in the mid 1970s and one would say provided the idea for the movies Speed and Speed 2: Cruise Control. Who can get to the bomb in time?

I get the feeling this was written with teenage readers in mind but even if you`re an adult(!) you will have a whale of a time. The characters are right out of a Grade Z sci-fi film of the 1950s, the story is rather predictable but nonetheless great fun and the gory scenes are somewhat silly.

Much of the plot is a passable rehash of Larry Bond`s excellent Red Phoenix, although the Japanese targeting of the Nodong Scuds and the politics surrounding it was a good twist. But did we really have to put up with the snivelling Gregory Donald character who spent the entire novel wallowing in self pity over his wife blown up in the Seoul bombing at the start(another plagarism - Red Phoenix began with a Seoul massacre!) - he should have been written out at the start. Save the pulp romances for dumb housewives! Other than that, and the goof - a Stealth fighter, the F117 cannot take off from an aircraft carrier(get a life!), and the secondhand plot, this is a passable first effort. Games of State is far superior. This one`s good for a plane or beach read to pass the time, but nowhere near as excellent as Tom Clancy`s real long novels.	1998-03-22

No excessive personal studies of characters, so those of you looking for that try his longer novels. This is straightforward submarine warfare complete with explanations of the terms and acronyms used. Like Red Storm Rising, this is one of his best, a real war novel. The scenarios and battle scenes are well told and highly realistic and the development of the Spratly Island war is highly feasible. If the USS Cheyenne can make all those kills in real life, send it to the Gulf!(ha ha). The character development did not really matter when the story is purely about strategy and survival. I`ve not played the game yet, but reading this has made me more curious. This book is highly recommended, and if you don`t know anything about submarines, this is a perfect introduction with its `in yer face` approach. A MUST READ!	1998-02-08

The premise, of a 75 year old treaty which could change the shape of America and the mystery surrounding the train and boat disasters is an ingenious idea. I was reading this at work in lunch and tea breaks and couldn`t wait to read the next bit . . . even though I`ve now read this one three times ever since I first had it several years ago as a teanager.

Ignoring those, the way Jack Ryan becomes President, forms a government out of the people that are left after Sato`s kamikaze attack on the Capitol, and the way he slips up when dealing with issues such as criminal justice and abortion are highly realistic. The Ebola Zaire plot and the United Islamic Republic angle are both extremely well crafted, even if the idea does seem as though it was copied from the movie Outbreak at times. Mind you, the monkey culling scenes and the description of the effects of the disease made that movie seem like pure Disney. Overall though, this book is one you`ll need plenty of time to read because despite the odd flaw, it has the Tom Clancy trademark of being extremely hard to put down! Jack Ryan should return for another term of Presidency, but what crisis can Clancy cook up this time?!	1998-01-03

The plot is highly convincing and too feasible for comfort. The message here is that nobody is immune from either terrorism or sleaze allegations, (that being the case of Cathy) - I was praying she wouldn`t walk out on him! Elizabeth Elliot is an inspired yet utterly dislikeable badmouth. The scenes involving the destruction of the Superbowl, President Fowler`s incompetence(also quite realistic in today`s climate) and the world heading faster than a bullet train towards nuclear war are simply compulsive reading. The military scenes, are, of course, unsurpassable in their brilliance. For those who have not read Clancy yet, this one is an ideal intorduction to his inimitable style of writing and intricate plotting.	1998-01-03
