But I had  to give my review now so folks could enjoy this book as much as I am.  Its  charming and delightful.  The author discusses the relationship she has  developed with a real Leprechaun.  Now normally, I would enjoy this type of  story but give it no validity beyond fiction.  But surprising, this author  seems to have really experienced this.  The information she recieves from  her new found friends is metaphysically advanced, refreshingly new  information, and feels true on a deep level. I can't wait to find out what  happens next.  It's a great story as well.  Enjoy. Many thanks to the  author, I hope your reading this.  I BELIEVE YOU!	2000-08-07

Great to take on trips.  It goes thru  much of the animal kingdom, telling us more and more about each creature,  in both thier actions in the world and the metaphysical medicine, or  energies, each of these creatures brings to us.  My meditation groups uses  the Animal-Speak book all the time to look up the meanings of the different  animals that come to them in altered states.  The more we use the book, the  more the animals appear.  What a great way for the unconscious to  communicate to us, through these wonderful animal totoms and thier powers.   Easy to read book.  Very useful.  We keep a copy in the car to look up the  messages of the different animals that choose to appear to us on our path.   thanks :-)	2000-08-07

I have so enjoyed this deck over the years.  When I first recieved it,  following the easy directions for use, I was able to determine my entire  totom (all the animals that influence me).  I found it to be amazingly  accurate.  The system allows the user to understand the symbolic meaning of  the animals which appear to us, in dreams, in person, or I even count the  ones on TV.  Thier messages are always timely and useful.  The cards are  lovely, the book is complete, easy to use, with just wonderful stories that  make it very easy to remember and use the system quickly.  I love it.   Thanks to the creators.	2000-08-07

I bought this book because I really enjoyed &quot;Eat right 4 your type&quot;.  But I was somewhat dissapointed in this.  It was an over simplification of a very complicated issue.  The 4 basic personality types  didn't hold true for most people I know, and I think its a little difficult  to put all humans in the world into only 4 catagories anyway.  It just  doesn't hold up.  I understand the authors generalizations, but just don't  agree that people's personalities are so easily typed into such few  catagories.  Homeopathy uses over 100 catagories and that is incomplete.   Some of the point made are interesting, but in general its not what I'd  hoped for.	2000-07-21

This book reviews the scientific information on more current herbs and  herbal remedies, such as Gingko, Billberry, Centella, and others, with very  precicse and interesting information on how they work in the body, with  references to all the current studies being done on them.

This is an often  overlooked part of homeopathy but a very important part.

Learning the REAL life lessons and history of the world from the Voice of a Gorrilla.  I still quote the author on topic of man's Human Chauvinism.   We're so arrogant as to think that WE are the purpose of creation, from  Ishmael's (the gorilla) point of view, that is our real delemma, we think  we own, and use up our earth resources.  There may be other species who  don't agree.  I love the idea of listining to sage advice from another of  god's creatures. I recommend this book highly, and advise to share it with  your kids.

It's farely easy to find your own through  reading the book, and shows how much of how we act in in our typing.  I  really enjoyed this information, and shared it with friends who also found  great value in it.

I feel this work came from a  higher place.  As a Nurse, I know this artist is exact when drawing the  body, and as a spiritual person, I feel he is exact in depicting the  spirit.  This is a great reference for people doing 'Reiki&quot; or  &quot;Healing Touch&quot; because you shows you in images, what your  feeling in your work.

I read this book front to cover.  It's a great reference book on Flower  Essences, both English and North American, but the discriptions on the  actions of each flower are new information on how spirit issues can effect  the emotions and the body.   I had never read any psychological work that  took this perspective and I found it very useful and tremendously  insightful.  Even if you don't choose to buy the flower remedies, the  analysis of the problems and possible causes are often enough to motivate  the spirit toward change. Additionally, I'm greatful to the Company who  produces these remedies, as they include local flowers to the U.S.A.  Dr.  Bach said &quot;the cure to your disease lies in your own back yard&quot;,  yet all that the Bach Flowers offers is from Europe.  FES has all the North  Amercian Flowers discribed in the book and in flower remedies.   I  particularly enjoyed looking up my Grandmothers favorot flowers and reading  about the issues they assist in.  I found that often they spoke to a long  term family dynamics that existed for 3 generations, the flower  preferrences were the intuitive attempt at my grandmothers cure.  It's fun  to look up your favorot flowers, and see what issues you may be working on.    I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in flower remedies,  spiritual/emotional issues or thier connection to plant energies.  The book  is extremely well written and organized.

The Art of Sexual Ecstasy is beautifully and elegantly written  that you never have that embarrased feeling when sharing it becuase it  reads nearly like peotry.

I read this book a few times, and I still don't see evidence that the authors premise, that parasites cause Cancer, has been proved.  Without that proof then the cure ends up being dangerous when done instead of  traditional care, or just expensive when done along with traditional care.  As a nurse, in the alternative field, to date, I've not seen one person get  better for having read this book, but that doesn't mean that others havn't  benifited, I just don't get the premise and havn't seen the cures  personally.

A great coffee table book if for nothing else, but thats not to underestimate the content.

When my sister was diagnosed with cancer I sent her just about every book I could find on cancer survival, inspiration and the like.  But when I stumbled onto this set, 2 tapes and a book, without listening or reading  it, I sent it on.  One week later she called me and told me that this set  had helped her more than any other single book or tape out there.  Most  importantly it helped her deal with her fear, set her priorities for  healing strategies in order, gave her a concrete meditation for invisioning  the actual immune system, and discussed indentifing her passions and  dreams, as they would help her survive, and much more.  She followed the  advice absolutly, started horse back riding again (her passion) and lived  another 8 years, when she had been told only 6 months.
