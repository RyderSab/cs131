A surreal blend of travel literature, history, and even philosophy, _From Paris to the Moon_ will almost certainly contain anecdotes and observations unknown to even the most diehard Parisian-trivia buffs. For those of us who haven't been studying the city for a lifetime, Gopnik provides an accessible overview of his subject before delving into the nitty-gritty. Beautifully written and tremendously engaging.	2000-10-23

It would be great, no doubt. Cheryl Richardson expects the best from her readers, and anyone trying to follow these 52 lessons will find himself or herself breathless with exertion by the end. One week may simply not be enough to change deep-rooted personality traits. However, it's worth a shot, and if you do them in a different order, or miss a few, or don't finish, the changes you do implement successfully will more than merit the cost of the book and the time spent on self-improvement. Recommended.	2000-10-11

Rather than simply make observations about the relationships he has witnessed between people and their pets, he assembles decades of scientific research and archaeological evidence to explain how the deep bond between people and animals came about, how dogs and their owners have helped each other for tens of thousands of years. Although the story is not always warm and fuzzy (people have put dogs to many unsavory uses over the millennia), Budiansky still makes the strongest case I've seen for the unique nature of the human-dog bond. A terrific read, and incredibly informative.	2000-10-08

Instead, what I found was a series of observations and reminiscences by the members, many of them brand new to me, and almost all of them engaging in a way that most writing on the Beatles isn't. For anyone truly interested in the group and its members, this book is required reading.	2000-10-06

For that reason alone, Sherry Bell's book is worth reading, as she provides her touching, often funny, often painful story of her mother's struggle with Alzheimers. Even more valuable, however, are Bell's generalized comments on pain and loss, which will move and inspire anyone who is watching a loved one slip away.	2000-10-06

Your house isn't grand enough, which you couldn't afford and wouldn't want anyway. Turning away from the architectural glossies and their emphasis on intriguing design, Susan Susanka instead examines what makes a house a home--what arrangements of space lead to the comfort and familiarity that we all treasure.<br />The book is not a cheap do-it-yourself manual. &quot;Not enormous&quot; does not mean &quot;thrifty.&quot; If, however, you are interested in building your own home, you cannot afford to ignore this book.	2000-10-05

The connections he draws between his own experiences and his writing actually make sense, as they are not buried in layers of psychological or literary theory: certain characters are drawn from life, and he tells us which incidents in his life inspired his plots.<br />The self-conscious &quot;writing tutorial&quot; elements of the book are a little drier, if only because King's engaging personality is a little more distant. But they would be impressive, standing on their own: they pale only when placed next to the memoir.	2000-10-05

This is too bad, because Johnson's point is a valid and subtle one: different people have different motivations which are always changing over time, and no one can (or should) assume that he/she understands the motives of others. Johnson suggests commonsense methods of tolerance to allow us all to get along, which is not as obvious as it sounds, given the recent spate of management texts claiming to offer the solution to all employee-motivation problems.<br />All in all, an interesting point made in an original fashion.	2000-10-05

However, while the authors of this outstanding work may occasionally sound like their guru colleagues, their book is far more intellectually sound, vastly more detailed, and ultimately far more useful than the flimsy writing that dominates the business shelves.<br />Kaplan and Norton have done their homework. For every suggestion, they provide a wealth of examples, and they are intellectually honest enough to discuss all the evidence, including that which may run against them. As a result, I have great faith in the soundness of their conclusions. Absolutely a must-read for anyone interested in the evolution of business strategy.	2000-10-05

Of course. Is it possible to hedge market-wide risks? Yes, although not in quite such a straightforward manner. The authors of this book breathlessly report this same conclusion as if it were brand new, and not taught in finance courses around the country. Although the resulting precious tone is annoying, it does not detract from the value of the rest of the book, which is essentially a primer in market-neutral investment, and a good one.	2000-10-05

Drudge regales the reader with anecdotes from his reporting over the last several years, mixed in with a healthy dose of his theories of politics and the media. The result can be a little overbearing, as Drudge frequently and fondly refers to himself as one of the great journalistic pioneers of our era, but when his ego is in check, he can be extremely thoughtful (presenting, for example, an innovative approach to the responsibilities of journalism and how they have already been compromised by others). The dirt he has dug up in the course of his work is also great reading.	2000-10-05

Gergen's is  different primarily because he draws interesting contrasts among the  different administrations (and different political parties) for which he  worked. The book is at its best when Gergen steps into the background: his  career, while often impressive, is not especially interesting, and he  doesn't have terribly profound insights into himself. When making  observations about Reagan and (especially) Clinton, however, he's at his  best.	2000-09-17

This is an interesting  (and probably accurate) distinction to make, but the difference between  being a badly led army and a bad army is not an obvious one. No modern  historian claims that the French had poor equipment or insufficient  numbers, but only that French organization and doctrine were ineffective  against the Germans.<br />Is this all that different from what May is saying?  Not really. Where May becomes most interesting is in his analysis of the  course of events in May 1940, where he makes a persuasive case that the  French generals were both unlucky and foolish. Whether he has attacked the  conventional wisdom is unclear, but the book is a lucid exposition of the  conflict.	2000-09-17

Sometimes this is  infuriating--that is, whenever I disagree with him--but more often it is  thought-provoking and usually quite funny.

This book is no exception: Ambrose  does a terrific job of digging up truly inspirational stories of common  laborers who underwent grueling hardship in order to build the  railroads.<br />The result is a very compelling read. However, given how much  effort went into this book and given the obvious depth of Ambrose's  research, it would have been nice to see a bit more perspective, a bit more  actual history surrounding the railroad. If you are still curious about the  subject after reading Ambrose's book, I highly recommend _Empire Express_  by David Howard Bain.	2000-09-13

For this  reason alone, the book is worth buying. His preferred investment strategy  is essentially an old-school value-investing approach, which is certainly  viable but not clearly better than index investing, as Sheard claims.

More specifically, I've never heard  of some of the people he claims are important figures in the business, and  others are only marginal players. The reason for this, of course, is that  Kurtz is after the good story, and so he leaves aside more pedestrian and  above-board enterprises, choosing instead to focus on the rogues. The  result is a fascinating book that won't necessarily tell you too much about  its purported subject.	2000-09-13

The letters in this  book show that Reagan was as able to be emotional and even insightful with  a single person--his wife--as he was with audiences of thousands. The  letters are touching, and often profoundly moving.<br />Nancy's commentary has  its ups and downs. While she can be powerful, especially when talking about  Alzheimer's, at other times she can be a bit perfunctory. Skim her  sections, and read a few with attention.	2000-09-13

Lowenstein's book makes this  story accessible by glossing over some of the technical details, a tradeoff  of readability for depth, but still provides insight into the causes of  LTCM's collapse. I recommend reading both this book and Nicholas Dunbar's  excellent _Inventing Money_: Dunbar provides more technical explanations,  while Lowenstein has a richer story to tell about the people involved.	2000-09-13

John Maxwell, however, has done a tremendous job of drawing  meaningful conclusions from the Bible without being either condescending or  heavy-handed. The insights he draws from many of the stories (I especially  admired those of Solomon, Esther, and Moses) are often new and  valuable.<br />Having said that, this is hardly &quot;Leadership from  Dummies.&quot; The value of the stories is inspirational and illustrative,  but not directly applicable to work and life. I think Maxwell was  unnecessarily concerned about this, and as a result built each story around  a series of steps and meditations for the readers. I would worry less about  what, exactly, you should do to integrate the leadership skills of Moses  (for example) into your daily life than simply to take value and meaning  from the story.	2000-09-13

By addressing such large issues, as well, Gilder will certainly  cause you to rethink some deeply held beliefs about the future of  communications.<br />That said, this book would have been much more valuable  four years ago than it is now. Much of what Gilder predicts, while still in  the future, is conventional wisdom: net computing will flourish, wireless  technologies will take off, and selling will become much more targeted.  Probably true, but I didn't need Gilder to tell me that.<br />Having said this  much, this book is still an interesting look at where we've been and where  we're (probably) going.

Frank Close has done a  terrific job of explaining exactly how many of the neat coincidences we see  around us (weights of subatomic particles, strengths of atomic forces,  etc.) are in fact coincidences (not many, is Close's guess) and how many  are in fact necessary for matter to exist in its current condition (a good  number).

And that was  just a novel). Garment doesn't have anything new, but he combines all the  clues that exist (there aren't many) and produces a plausible guess. Is he  right? I don't know, and I suspect neither does he. But the point of the  book is not to find out who Deep Throat is, but to relive the scummy  underbelly of Watergate, following the leaks and counterleaks, attempts to  unmask and conceal sources, and so on. This is a fun book to read, even if  Deep Throat's identity (Garment's guess, unfortunately, is not particularly  exciting) remains unknown.	2000-08-07

In truth, the  profiles are fairly objective, and I was unclear why CIA wants to maintain  secrecy around some of them.<br />In many cases, the death chronicled was  incidental to the operation, and does not mean than CIA bungled or even  that the operation was a failure. One operative in Cyprus happened to be  killed in a bomb blast set by terrorists: he looks unlucky, but not  necessarily incompetent or betrayed. Sometimes the deaths seem only  remotely connected to the operation, as in the story of an agent who  committed suicide in a Chinese prison after several years of  confinement.<br />In short, this is an interesting and well-written book that  provides a good close-up look at CIA. Although by focusing on the dead, Ted  Gup ensures that he writes about primarily failed missions, it doesn't make  the Agency look as terrible as one might think from the description.	2000-08-07

I won't forget ADM soon, though. All the dirty tricks you hear about  seem to have been concentrated in one company: everything from antitrust  violations to bribery and intimidation. Short of treason, it's hard to  think of a crime ADM didn't commit.<br />James Lieber has done a tremendous  amount of research, and it shows. Even when no first-hand sources are  available, he is often able to reconstruct a conversation or meeting, and  he is very fair about drawing a clear line between facts and suppositions.  My only complaint is that he can get a little carried away in his  criticism, blaming ADM for practices common to many American corporations  (e.g. political contributions, influence peddling, media spin). However,  this is a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding book. Buy it and read it.	2000-08-04

Most of the books I have read on the subject focus on the  struggle against death and against pain, but while Larry Rosenberg  certainly supports the idea that you should embrace life, he takes an  honest look at what happens to people who will lose the fight--a group  that, in the final analysis, includes everyone.<br />Rosenberg is one of the  few authors I have read with the courage to address the inevitable and to  show us how to embrace what we can delay, but what we cannot prevent. Using  examples from a wide variety of cultures, he looks at the way in which  others face death, and shows us what lessons we can learn as we approach  the ends of our lives. Whether you hope to live for eight more weeks or  eighty more years, Rosenberg has an important message for you.	2000-08-04

In most hands, these ingredients would blow any novel off the tracks in the first few pages,  quickly degenerating into melodrama. Christine Schwarz, with impressive  skill and beautiful writing, keeps her plot under control--but just barely.  The mystery about the drowning threatens to overwhelm the rest of the novel  whenever it comes to the foreground, but Schwarz's portraits of her  characters and of the period lives they live is so persuasive, and so  compelling, that you are willing to grant her enough leeway to get away  with this story.

Richard Holmes has written a no-nonsense concise guide to both World War I  and the controversial historiography that has dogged the conflict ever  since. He summarizes the events of the Western Front (only--other theaters  are mentioned only as they impact Germany's decisions about force  allocation) quickly, perhaps too quickly for my taste. He slows down a  little bit when reviewing the major controversies from the war over  tactics, strategy, and war guilt, where he examines the different schools  of thought with an even hand. Sometimes his hand is too even: on some  topics, particularly when discussing the question of why trench warfare  degenerated into such bloody, futile slaughter, I wanted Holmes to be  bolder in naming names.<br />But these are petty disagreements with what is a  very successful attempt to summarize the events on the Western Front. I  hope Holmes will someday give other theaters similar treatment.	2000-08-02

In this book, she demolishes most of the tried-and-thought-true assumptions about politics, usually taking a more  optimistic tack. The thrust of her argument is first, that the American  public is not becoming less politically capable (for the most part), and  second, that the media pursues its own agenda and distorts the news more  than we like to admit. She makes both of these points in a somewhat messy  manner, because her topics are all over the place, but it's hard to  disagree with her at the end.	2000-08-01

I used to have a copy of the original 1980 edition of Abagnale's book, and lost a good friend several years ago when he skipped town with it.

In fact, Abagnale's story is so interesting and so funny that you can't  help but like him. This is reinforced by the fact that he seems to have so  much fun with it himself, often playing up a role more than he strictly  needs to, with hilarious results.<br />This book is terrific. There are no  slack moments, no dull episodes, and some of them are outstanding (the time  when he poses as a pediatrician and has to feign medical knowledge is  perhaps the funniest thing I've ever read, followed closely by his attempt  to pass himself off as an assistant attorney general). The fact that  Abagnale has come clean and now works on the right side of the law is just  one more reason to buy and read this tremendous book.	2000-08-01

The foundation is similar (don't waste your money, think about total income and total cost, etc.), but this tacks on a  fair amount of investment advice, explaining which assets are good and  which aren't. To make a long story short, Kiyoski promotes cashflow at the  expense of nominal income. This makes sense in some ways: simply owning a  house that is theoretically appreciating in value may or may not be helpful  to you, if you're never planning to sell it. On the other hand, it needs to  be taken carefully, since most of us realize most of our investment gains  from capital gains in one form or another.<br />So, read this book for the  commonsense lifestyle adjustments, and enjoy the investment sections, but  treat them with caution.	2000-07-28

This is the perfect book for anyone in that situation: Cotsakos does not assume  that you know anything at all about computers, or about investing, for that  matter. He walked me through the basic steps (finding an Internet Service  Provider, for example) with idiot-proof instructions.<br />In addition to  being extremely useful to novice online investors, the book is a pleasure  to read. My sister, who has never bought a stock in her life, read most of  it simply for amusement value. I recommend this book to everyone.	2000-07-28

Gloom-and-doom prophets should read this book in order to check their own  certainty that we are in the midst of such a bubble. However, Garber does  not convince us that the current levels of the stock market, even if  &quot;rational&quot;, may not collapse just as the rational tulip bulb  market, etc. did. So, yes, it's an interesting and thoughtful book, but  pessimists may hold on to the substance of their beliefs even after reading  it.	2000-07-28

However, because the authors felt duty-bound to include biographies of all nine women in the Senate, instead  of picking and choosing, there are some definite slow spots. For example,  while many of the women really did overcome tremendous obstacles during a  climb from obscurity (e.g. Patty Murray), it feels as if others simply  stumbled into the Senate because they were in the right place at the right  time, and/or they came from powerful political families. The reader may  want to skim some of these profiles. Still, the book is well-written and at  its best can be quite moving.	2000-07-28

I soon realized, however, that  the message of this book is not a short-sighted &quot;Follow these steps  and you will become rich,&quot; but rather, &quot;Do what you want to do,  be willing to take risks, and anything can happen.&quot; What all the  subjects of the profiles have in common is an individual vision and a  willingness to sacrifice in order to reach it, and that is a message  everyone can profit from.

This book goes back to the beginning of the story, tracing Walter Chrysler's beginnings through the  early decades of his car company. Chrysler's life, which was never less  than flamboyant, is the ideal subject for a biography (why did no one write  one before?), and Vincent Curcio has brought a colorful and engaging style  to the story. The book's focus shifts between the company's business  decisions, always daring if occasionally foolish, and Chrysler's personal  life, which is wildly entertaining. My only complaint about the book is  that it might have been a little bit shorter; even Walter Chrysler has  trouble filling up 600+ pages. But it's a delight to read nonetheless.	2000-07-28

Freedman is a great writer, and he populates his story with a cast of colorful characters.<br />Second, Freedman's management principles are going to be very effective in certain  kinds of organizations--organizations in which orders are carried out  without question and well-defined lines of reporting make it very clear who  is responsible for tasks. The Marines are like this, but not very many  other organizations. So, while these ideas may be useful, the manager who  starts applying them blindly to his or her own company may find a lot of  work not getting done. Read with pleasure, use with care.	2000-07-28

These laws aren't immutable; they probably aren't even laws, as Ries &amp; Ries freely admit throughout the  book.<br />Unlike a lot of the e-babble floating around out there, this book  takes a definite stand, and does not hide in vague, unfalsifiable  assertions about how everything's going to change. Instead, there are  predictions and advice: the internet will not replace television. Build a  separate web brand.<br />I disagreed with probably 6 or 7 of the 11  &quot;immutable laws,&quot; especially when the authors are discussing the  relations among online and offline brands. However, they never failed to  make me stop and consider why I believe what I believe about e-branding,  which is important in itself. This shouldn't be the only, or perhaps even  the first, internet branding book you buy, but it's a good way to question  and expand your thinking on the subject.	2000-07-26

It succeeds. This is not the book to buy if you want a sober recitation of the facts or a thoughtful  analysis of why impeachment failed; it is, however, the first place to  start if you want amusing (but unsubstantiated) rumors about Clinton's sex  life, and plenty of names named (whether justified or not). Occasionally,  you get a few insights that may be worth something beyond sleaze value,  such as Larry Flynt's role in dethroning Newt Gingrich's would-be  successor, but mostly this is an unpretentious hatchet book having fun with  the most mockable of recent presidents. Occasionally Eszterhas will get a  little too gross for most readers (the last thing I wanted was another  recounting of the cigar incident), but almost everyone will get some laughs  out of this book.	2000-07-26

However, they are doing something much broader and more interesting  than simply explaining a single failure; instead, they have constructed a  theory of American political life that shows (according to them) that  socialism NEVER COULD HAVE been successful in the United States. In some  ways, it is a pity that this book's title will probably limit its appeal to  students of socialism, because it addresses far more.<br />Their thesis has  many, many supporting arguments, but the two most important to me seemed to  be first, that American political culture is naturally predisposed against  collectivism and class warfare. The authors trace this tendency back to  19th-century economic and social conditions, and discuss how it interacted  with incoming groups of immigrants. Second, the authors discuss the  inability of socialism to offer the most attractive vision of the future to  the working class (unlike in Europe, where the unions are all socialist).  This failure meant that socialism could never attract a mass base, and as a  result was confined to the vocal but numerically insignificant leftist  intelligentsia.<br />I did not agree with everything in this book, but I found  it extremely thought-provoking and recommend it wholeheartedly.	2000-07-26

It is also a great history. Craig and Clayton have definitely done their homework, digging through both official archives and endless (and occasionally disturbing) eyewitness testimony. The result is  the best book on the subject I've ever read.<br />The authors have wisely  decided to focus on the essentials of this story. Instead of a numbing  account of each raid, we get an overall summary of events for each period  of time and a detailed description of a few representative events. When  appropriate, we also go behind the scenes to hear what leaders on all sides  of the conflict are thinking, although they don't overdo this.<br />The  authors have challenged some cherished myths about the conflict (although  perhaps not to the extent they claim). Most obviously, they cite examples  of Allied atrocities, to counteract the myth that Britain fought completely  nobly. However, they back up all their assertions scrupulously and never  tear down the Allies just for the sake of it.<br />The result is one of the  most readable and thoughtful books I have read on World War II.	2000-07-25

As a result, the reader  with a strong background in this history will not find much new. However,  the book is extremely well-written and very accessible--I read it in two  sittings, and my 12-year-old brother has just started it.<br />In addition to  effective writing, Gilbert includes some chilling photographs and  reproductions of other primary sources. Especially disturbing are German  documents cold-bloodedly noting that so many Jews arrived at such-and-such  a camp, of whom X were killed immediately, and Y put to work.<br />Parents who  believe their children are of an appropriate age might consider reading  this book together as a way of introducing the most important, and most  horrific, crime of this century.

What a terrific symbol of...something!<br />Well, yes and no. Paterniti has a terrific story, chronicling the adventures of Einstein's brain over the  last forty-odd years. And he can be genuinely funny when presented with  incongruous situations (and when you have Einstein's brain in the back  seat, almost all situations are incongruous).<br />The problem is that  Einstein's brain doesn't do much, and Paterniti doesn't do much with it, at  least not in a literal sense. They're driving, and there's that brain.  That's the whole plot. To fill up the book, Paterniti has to give us his  grand thoughts about Einstein and science. These are interesting, but they  aren't THAT interesting.<br />The book is worth reading just to find out  what's happened to Einstein's brain. But that's a relatively short section.  Paterniti's rambling on about science and America will not hold your  attention for all 220+ pages.	2000-07-25

Books	4	12	14	N	N	A compelling read, and pretty good history	I'm not sure what Diana Preston does for a living. I don't think she's a historian for two reasons: first, her writing is much livelier than most historians' (good), and second, she seems less careful with her sources  than many historians (bad). The result is a fairly breezy account of the  Boxer Rebellion as seen through the eyes of the Westerners living in China  at the time, with special focus on those trapped in the siege.<br />Most of  the sources are first-hand accounts by Westerners caught up in the  fighting, and as you might expect, the book relies heavily on anecdotes as  a result. This is fun to read, but left me hungry for more background and  information on the Boxers. Sometimes it felt as if complex groups of actors  were being shoehorned into single monolithic categories, e.g. &quot;The  Boxers,&quot; &quot;The Imperial Court,&quot; or  &quot;Britain.&quot;<br />These minor flaws detract from the book if you're  interested in an academic analysis of the rebellion. However, as a good  history book to curl up with, this can't be beat.	2000-07-25

John Law stands at the intersection of 17th-century finance, mathematics, and politics in Great Britain, and this biography of him (broadly construed)  sheds light on all three. Gleeson does an amazing job of using often scanty  source materials to shine a light on previously little-known elements of  Law's career: we all know him as a smooth-talking financier, but most  readers will be surprised by some of the anecdotes Gleeson gives us from  Law's prison days (including the fact that he eventually escaped, which was  news to me).<br />I recommend this book without hesitation. The subject is  fascinating, the research is exhaustive, and the writing is superb. My only  caveat, and it is a minor one, is that Law was assisted by an almost  equally colorful cast of minor players, some of whom get short shrift here.  But that is a reason to read more widely on the subject, and the best place  to start is this book.	2000-07-23

The result is an astonishingly successful blend of  philosophy, memoir, and literary commentary. While Kornfield's spiritual  background is Buddhist, he is aware of and receptive to the theories of  enlightenments in all major religions and even the more secular Emersonian  beliefs that have helped shape American spirituality.<br />The book is not  tightly organized, but is written in a series of short sections, which  variously touch on Kornfield's personal history, his current belief system,  and his favorite authors, blending them into a coherent whole. I found the  sections on T.S. Eliot and Walt Whitman to be among the most insightful  commentaries on their work available to the lay reader.<br />At the same time  that Kornfield is astonishingly well-read and deeply wise, he is never  scolding or pedantic. As his title suggests, he is well aware of our human  foibles and failings, and he displays a deep understanding and tolerance of  the ways in which most of his readers will fall short of the example he  sets.<br />This is Kornfield's finest work, and a book that be read for  decades to come by those interested in exploring their spirituality.	2000-07-23

This book is no exception.<br />Moore is arguing that the Internet  has, as a few commentators have already noticed, changed the face of  business. Much of what he says is not new at this point--you don't need  Moore to tell you that outsourcing is critical, and that the first-mover  advantage is so important that many companies are sacrificing earnings for  growth.<br />What is new, and what will be controversial, is Moore's  discussion of stock price as a real-value indicator. He argues that because  the stock price and trend is a real-time survey of the investing community,  it is a useful guide to how well a company is doing. There is of course  some truth in this (when the stock of a high-flyer tanks, it's a bad sign),  but I and many others will no doubt question whether a high P/E means that  the company is doing well, or whether its investor relations are simply  outpacing the rate at which the market comes to understand these  companies.<br />All in all, well worth reading, as it has much more real  substance than many e-business books that are being published these days.	2000-07-21

Instead of his usual precise and insightful prose, this book feels like an extended  impromptu lecture, with epigrammatic insights that can intriguing, but  won't have a lot of impact on your reading habits.<br />I had hoped for  something more literary and specific, with more of the book devoted to  specific works. Instead, this is a feel-good discussion of why Bloom likes  to read. Much of the book discusses his preferences, both in specific  authors and in reading habits (e.g. read aloud), but without enough detail  to convince us. It is engaging, and occasionally inspiring, but not  especially memorable.	2000-07-21

In his latest book, he argues that the horizontal  linkages made possible by the Internet (which allows for much tighter  integration of different firms at much lower costs) will allow category  killers to arise in both New and Old Economy niches. This is a serious  idea, and one that deserves the detailed attention he gives it.<br />I am not  entirely sure he's right. Companies like Webvan, which he cites in a case  study, will succeed or fail based on how well they handle the old-fashioned  problem of distribution. Only companies with NO physical product  unambiguously meet his definition of taking full advantage of the  &quot;b-web.&quot;<br />Still, Tapscott has an interesting idea, and he has  argued it well. Whether or not you agree, reading this book will force you  to reconsider your own position, and that in itself is valuable.	2000-07-21

When reading anything by Norman Podhoretz, I usually have to unclench my teeth at least once an hour. To my surprise, I made it through the entire book in a single day, and my blood pressure never rose into the red  zone.<br />This book is far more autobiographical than anything Podhoretz has  written (that I've read to date), and anyone seeking to demonize him as a  humorless reactionary will have trouble doing so after reading his  portraits of his grandparents and parents.<br />Of course, Podhoretz hasn't  changed THAT much, and along the way he makes excursions into both  non-contentious history (the uneasy role of the American intellectual) and  highly partisan recountings of his own battles (especially around the  1960s). This is the cultural critic we know and love/hate, and Podhoretz is  at the top of the form (except for a few vicious ad hominem attacks  reminiscent of those in &quot;Ex-Friends&quot;).<br />Podhoretz also devotes a  great deal of space to the nature of Jewish identity in this book, using  his family history as a springboard. This is a little more sentimental than  most of his writing, but still of high quality.<br />This is not vintage  Podhoretz, due to the autobiographical framework, which forces the author  to fit his observations into a tighter structure than he is used to. He  also seems to have mellowed a bit with age. However, his powers are as  sharp as ever, and it is refreshing to see him deploy them in a new  context.	2000-07-17

Nathaniel Philbrick is not a squeamish man, and most readers (including me) will remember the...uh...culinary sections of this book long after the rest has faded away.<br />The book's title is slightly misleading: while  Philbrick does detail the story of the Essex, he spends large sections of  the book setting the background with a discussion of the whaling industry  and contemporary seafaring in general. This information is fascinating (if  you don't care about eating anyone, perhaps you want to know how to process  a whale carcass?), but often tangential to the story, and readers shouldn't  expect a Jon-Krakauer-style narrative that grabs you by the collar on page  one and never lets you go.

He cites numerous examples  to show that even a slight change in initial conditions can mean the  difference between a bull and a bear market, or between a rumor's being  spread or not.<br />All this is convincing, as far as it goes. However,  Gladwell does not seem to give his readers much credit, believing that we  will lose interest unless he gives the different roles in the transmission  of information cute names like &quot;Mavens&quot; and  &quot;Connectors&quot;.

Bob Greene has found a winning subject, but he also is a terrific writer. The  quality of the prose alone makes this book worth reading.<br />In addition,  Greene manages to strike an excellent balance between the factual structure  of his narrative and its emotional content. He neither wallows in maudlin  sentiment, as easy as it would be to do that with this affecting story of  his father's WWII experiences and the compelling history of Col. Tibbetts,  nor does he turn this into a dry biography.<br />My only complaint is that  Greene's efforts to link his father's story with Tibbetts are not entirely  convincing. The two men fought in entirely different theaters of the war,  and while Tibbetts was a nationally recognized celebrity, Greene was one of  the many unsung heroes from the war. While both the stories are moving, I  would rather have seen them kept separate.	2000-07-16

As hard as this is to believe, Al writes the way that he talks, often rambling over a wide range of subjects without much structure, and using plenty of exclamation  points for punctuation. Once you get used to this, though, you're in for a  treat. The first half of the book is an unflinching look at the Rokers'  struggle to have a child. After this, he lightens up a little bit in a  series of essays that don't have much in common, but which work well as  stand-alone pieces. Occasionally Al swings and misses (I'm not sure I  really care what his opinion on Ricky Martin is), but on the whole he is  cheerful and engaging.	2000-07-16

However, I think he's overreached in &quot;Spytime,&quot; which is an ungainly mix of history, an implausible  spy potboiler, and a stab at identifying the legendary &quot;fifth  man&quot; in Philby's circle.<br />The book feels as if Buckley just wants to  write a silly spy novel. He could write a good one if he didn't force  himself to include such an endless parade of historical characters, whose  actions have to be at least plausibly reconciled with the facts. Countless  heads of state, spymasters, and spies march across these pages without  adding much to the leading characters or the plot.<br />At the end, Buckley  makes an intriguing stab at the fifth man. I think he's been nursing this  theory for a while and wrote the book in order to publicize it. I wish he  had just told us flat out, and then written the novel he wanted to write.	2000-07-16

Rather  than recite platitudes, he tells us in fascinating and often gut-wrenching  detail exactly what he has had to do to beat his cancer (I found the  medical sections fascinating, as good as any science book you'll read on  the subject).

In order to keep  his book to a reasonable length, he sometimes moves along at an extremely  quick pace, and I found myself constantly reviewing earlier sections to  make sure I understood what was going on. But none of this detracts from  the guilty pleasure most readers will get from watching this slow-motion  collision between two completely incompatible corporate cultures.	2000-07-16

The biographies are universally well-written and often shed light on people you thought you knew well (for example, the Jefferson profile). Powell has also done us a  great service by bringing to light some lesser-known individuals whose  actions deserve more attention than they get in the usual history books  (e.g. Edward Coke). Everyone will disagree with some of the opinions here,  but that is only further evidence of the author's originality.	2000-07-14

Most of these facts boil down to the central conclusion that we go out less often  in smaller groups, and when we're out there, we're less civil to each  other.<br />All this does support his point admirably. However, as one willing  to concede his point from the very beginning (is anyone out there likely to  argue the opposite), I would have been interested in a more detailed and  (dare I say it?) more theoretical discussion of causes and implications,  beyond the old chestnut that &quot;this Brave New World is changing  everything, and it's hard to predict what will come next.&quot;	2000-07-14

The actual  journey his faith has made, however, left me a bit uneasy. He seems to be  endorsing a stone-age Christianity, in which efforts at understanding  anything except the direct experience of God are to be condemned as  rationalism or literalism. Still, his ideas are vibrant and his writing is  of the highest quality, and even those who disagree will find their own  faith refreshed through the dialogue.	2000-07-14

Connie Bruck's detailed account of the firm's rise to and fall from glory does a tremendous job of explaining exactly how and why junk bonds were so lucrative and so dangerous. This  book will make it difficult to maintain that the highly leveraged buyout is  anything better than the nuclear weapon of corporate finance--perhaps  useful as a theoretical threat, but ruinous when actually implemented. This  book also makes it clear that, with the exception of Michael Milken, few of  the protagonists were especially talented or clever individuals--they were  just at the right place in the right time.	2000-07-14

While the analysis in this book is fine as far as it goes, each of Dershowitz's examples is fairly straightforward (e.g. Cain  kills his brother and is punished only with exile), and any reader could  find similar ones on their own. His discussion of each example is  superficial, rarely going beyond a simplistic discussion of why it is  unfair that Cain gets off lightly, or why God sends the flood and kills  virtually the entire world. He rarely offers any useful insight into how  these stories are more or less than they appear or how they have affected  our views of justice.	2000-07-14

The  quality of the argument varies with the nature of Stein's target: he is  aiming largely to amuse, not to convert, and so he is most effective when  mocking causes and people beyond the pale (e.g. radical gender activists).

Admittedly, not all the corners are as ugly as the one he was working in, which mostly involved the sale of exotics to  unsuspecting and/or unscrupulous clients.

That should be  obvious, but in the critical reaction, some people seem to have forgotten  it.<br />As a purely intellectual undertaking, this collection is a bit of a  muddle. The essays have been edited with a very light touch, to put it  gently, and there is a great deal of redundancy and contradiction among the  authors. You might be better off with a longer book with a unified  viewpoint, but for an overview of a debate that will probably only sharpen  in the years to come, this is a good place to start.

Like many of his imitators, Lewis has a seemingly endless supply of funny stories about his time at  Salomon's bond desk during its glory days.

However, it isn't going to be very helpful if you're looking for a job. These places look for people with the right background,  the right skills, and only then does it matter how many books you've read  or how many case questions you've practiced.

Rather, he claims that Pius XII failed to resist effectively, and did not speak out against the  Holocaust. This much is undisputable, and it will be difficult for readers  of this book to view the pope as a hero. My only complaint is that Cornwell  doesn't spend enough time examining Pius's reasons for acting as he did:  the pope claimed that he was worried about retaliation against the city of  Rome. This is a plausible excuse, and makes Pius XII far more sympathetic  that if one considers him a Nazi sympathizer. Cornwell should have done  more work here.	2000-07-13

Unlike most accounts of the Eastern Front, this book manages to resolve the mass of details into a  limited number of coherent campaigns without dissolving into day-by-day  drudgery. Werth does not pay as much attention to details away from the  front, and the reader with a strong interest in these will want to  supplement this book with outside reading.	2000-07-13

As a  result, this book spends a great deal of time looking at Clark outside the  office, most often on his sailboat--fascinating information, but not what  many readers will be looking for.

The writing is tremendous and the narrative flows  very smoothly. The only element of the book that has not aged well is  Shirer's credulous acceptance of some of Hitler's farfetched  &quot;table-talk&quot; strategizing, which were not so much his plans for  world conquest as running off at the mouth.	2000-07-13

Strachman is clearly a believer in the industry, and readers not familiar  with the investment techniques described would do well to take some of his  claims with a grain of salt (specifically, that the managers profiled  necessarily know what they're doing).

He refuses to get bogged down in any single figure or school in his 500-year cultural tour, but  instead disposes of thinkers in a paragraph, a page, or at most a few  pages. At times, this can be frustrating, but more often it keeps your  energy level high enough to move quickly through the text. Don't think of  this as a weighty volume, but as a series of vignettes, each fascinating  and capable of standing on its own.<br />Like many reviewers, I am a little  bit puzzled by the fiercely pessimistic tone Barzun adopts towards the end.  However, this in no way compromises the pleasure of the book as a whole.	2000-07-12

Furthermore, the reader needs to ask the question  that Wills is unable to address effectively: if a believer begins to reject  elements of Catholicism on the grounds that they are impure or of strictly  temporaly origin, is that person still Catholic?	2000-07-12

Specifically, he asks why the war was fought and whether it was necessary. Although many of his specifics are  questionable, his overriding thesis--that the war was an integral and  necessary part of the Cold War, much like the Korean War--is difficult to  question.

It is popular, not scholarly, with no footnotes. The book's priorities are  old-fashioned, with the Eastern Front (where Germany committed two-thirds  of its strength) being disposed of in one chapter and a few subsequent  sections.

By putting the protagonist's budding philosophical and literary career in perspective, by depicting him as a  talented but still immature young man finding his way in life, she raises  intriguing questions about youth and Romanticism.

He examines the degradation of the army on the Eastern front and shows how the apolitical  army (if it ever existed) was largely destroyed in the first year of  fighting and reconstituted with individuals who had not been steeped in the  old independent army culture, but were products of the Nazi political  state.

Yet despite some perfunctory disclaimers, Greene presents  his conclusions as facts, or as almost-facts-that-will-be-nailed-down-soon.  This, plus the density of the text, means that anyone interested in  superstrings might want to start with a simpler, less partisan explanation  of where the science has come from and where it is going, and then read  this book to get more mathematical details.	2000-07-11

His thesis, argued throughout the book, is that the Vietnamese people viewed the French and then the Americans as  merely the latest in a centuries-long series of invaders. Those who are not  convinced may wish to skim the early chapters, which start thousands of  years ago, and skip to 1945 or so.	2000-07-11

That's why he doesn't waste any time in explaining exactly what we know about the universe at its largest scales and what remains to be discovered. In 300  compendious pages he can bring an ambitious reader to the cutting edge  (circa 1997) of cosmology. At times, the going may get a little too tough,  but the writing is first-rate and the information invaluable.	2000-07-11

This slender novel has time to do no more than sketch half a dozen characters and their daily struggles, but in doing so, Fitzgerald shares her profound insight  into the questions that we all face, especially those concerning love,  family, and loyalty. Highly recommended.	2000-07-11

Astonishingly so. I do this stuff for a living, and it still put me to sleep.<br />The reason it is so dull, however, is that it explains securities  processing with great clarity and precision, without any mistakes or  digressions. It is slightly outdated, so if the advances of the last seven  years are very important to you (they won't be, to most people--the back  office doesn't change as quickly as one would think), get Michael Reddy's  book &quot;Securities Operations&quot; instead.	2000-05-17

Despite some overmethodical and occasionally dubious measurement techniques (much is made of the  mysterious-sounding &quot;d ratio&quot;, which is simply the ratio of  winning months to losing months), Lavinio does provide some useful tools  for evaluating the past performance and future prospects of different hedge  funds.<br />The only disappointment is that Lavinio tends to treat hedge funds  as mysterious black boxes, scrutinizing their results without any real  attention to their methods. The lay reader will probably find little to  satisfy his/her curiosity.	2000-05-17

I knew it was a collection of (largely) previously published work, but why should that matter? Unfortunately, it turns out to matter a  lot. Buckley's magazine pieces would no doubt be funny if you came upon  them one at a time in a magazine, just the way Andy Rooney could be funny  at the end of a 60 Minutes broadcast. Strung end-to-end, however, these  short essays just become irritating. Here's one thing Buckley doesn't like.  Here's another. And another. The effect is only slightly more appealing  than a six-hour tape of Andy Rooney.	2000-05-07

It would either be a hatchet job on Disney's bizarre experiment or a thoughtful examination of just what such a town implies about American senses of community. Unfortunately, Ross hasn't  written either. He instead has written a dutiful report on every aspect of  Celebration's history, exercising little judgement as to what is  interesting (the fight over the Celebration school) and what is pretty  boring (the exercise habits of the residents, the locations of all the  houses of worship). Not very compelling.	2000-05-07

Then, as the mood slowly blackens, it turns to the darker effects of isolation. Then it turns into a mystery and a compelling  psychological novel rolled up in one.<br />The writing style is sparse and  very effective, so even those not fascinated by the lengthy descriptions of  nature at the beginning will be absorbed in the prose. The plot is  compelling and well-paced. My only complaint is that the mystery comes and  goes too quickly, before the reader is truly drawn in, but this is only a  minor problem with a very good novel.	2000-05-07

Instead of yet another journalistic rehash of the collapse of LTCM, Nicholas Dunbar has written a  thoughtful history of derivatives products and trading which serves as a  terrific overview of the subject. Readers not familiar with derivatives may  find some of this tough going, and occasionally Dunbar's explanations  become confused, but all the content is there.<br />Once you do get to LTCM,  the story becomes faster-paced while remaining intellectually rigorous, and  you will understand exactly what happened to the fund.	2000-05-07

However, it gives a very thorough and easy-to-read explanation of the arcana of market  structure, order processing, and the like. Extremely useful for ambitious  beginners.	2000-05-07

As I began reading this book, I realized that he was choosing to be even drier than normal. Then he became drier still. Then I realized that he was not  approaching this book with a dry sense of humor--he was approaching it with  no sense of humor.<br />We all assumed this book would be a subtler hatchet  job than usual, but with the same targets. Queenan throws away his  animal-tested cosmetics and buys everything at the Body Shop. And  then...?<br />Nothing. That's it, he just buys those environmentally-sound  shampoos and soaps, marvels at the price, and goes home. He doesn't poke  fun at what he's doing, and were it not for the introduction, you wouldn't  realize that this is only a poker face.<br />This book boils down to a long  shopping list. Queenan not only fails to crack a smile, but he doesn't even  hint that this is anything other than homework for him, which has been  assigned by an advance-wielding editor just as some teachers give out book  reports.	2000-05-07
US	51392462	R3K331P3BIWY5O	0140249281	620102767	The White House Mess	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Christopher Buckley skewers the fabled Insider's Memoir	This book will be funny to anyone, but readers unfortunate enough to have read any memoirs of the &quot;from the corridors of power&quot; genre will be convulsed. Buckley writes from the perspective of a high-ranking aide to  Reagan's fictional successor, President Tucker, jotting down a diary as  self-important as his real-life counterparts (one subplot turns around the  writer's attempt to keep his parking spot, which seems to be of equal  importance as the rest of the nation's business put together).<br />Buckley is  not just amusing, but often insightful. While the events of the book are  absurd, the characters are often all too realistic. A must-read for Buckley  fans, and highly recommended for anyone else.	2000-05-07
