It was the worst duty he had ever drawn-playing nursemaid to the Colonel's spoiled brat of a daughter. She was nothing but a nuisance and Major Dan Catlin was determined to keep her in tow and to protect the rebellious little chit's innocence. But who was going to protect him? He could barley resist her sparkling eyes that fluttered at him so provocatively, or her lush, young body that taunted and teased him, or her full, soft lips that begged to be kissed. But he was an officer and a gentleman and no matter how much he wanted  her, longed for her, he knew he had to stay away from her.	2001-07-12

Princess Yasaman had been blessed with rapturous beauty, fierce intelligence, and an innocent sensuality that captivated two formidable men-her scheming half brother, Salim, and her loving husband, Price Jamal. But her days of bliss and nights of steamy passion were shattered when Jamal was murdered, and Yasaman fled to England and the court of James I. Calling herself Jasmine, there she would be reunited with her gloriously beautiful mother, Velvet, and her grandmother, the legendary Skye O'Malley de Marisco. I loved this 6th novel in the O'Malley series. The only thing that disappointed me was how Velvet turned out. She was always my favorite character and the fact that Jasmine favored Skye more than her upset me. But that was just my biased opinion because I really loved This Heart of Mine, Velvet's story.	2001-07-12

Amid the lush green splendor of Louisiana horse country in 1812, fiercely independent Melissa Seymour finds herself drawn to devilishly irrestible Dominic Slade-although they cross verbal swords from the moment they meet. But as war between the U.S. and Britian rages, and treacherous political intrigue threatens, their concealed passions explode in a love story as turbulent and magnificent as the times. This was a great love story from Shirlee. Although when Dominic couldn't see through Melissa's disguise? That was alittle too much to believe. If she's this beautiful then glasses and a bun are not going to make her ugly. That was alittle far-fetched. Other than that it was a great read!	2001-07-12

Yet Catherine's destiny drew her on, into a world of intrigue and danger, and she fled fron Jason to the city of New Orleans-through an odyssey of peril and sexual captivity-to ecstatic reunion with the fearless adventurer who at last would quench the fire in her burning Gypsy soul. I have read much better work fron Shirlee. But we must remember this book was wrote in the 70's when it was cool to read about the torn bodice and viciousness of the main male character. At least Catherine had spunk! But the pride thing from both of them! Give it a rest and just talk! They presumed too much through the whole book.	2001-07-12
