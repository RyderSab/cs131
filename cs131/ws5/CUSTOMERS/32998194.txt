Everything about this book is spot on. <br />Reading a book from the perspective of someone born on February 29th was interesting, but that wasn't the only interesting thing about this book. <br />The very format of following one fairly ordinary day in the life of a teenager, and all the run-of-the-mill interactions was a very good idea, and it works, even though it sounds boring. The way Mass shows us not only Josie is feeling, but how everyone else around her has their own secrets, is ingenious, and can be very touching and sweet. The setting of Orlando was great also.<br />This is a book that looks fluffy and fun, and is, but has other levels that make it very rewarding and will put a smile on your face.	2004-05-08

Read how a single shark (the author supposes, after meticulous research) brought fear to the heart of thousands of bathers and vacationers along the Atlantic Shore almost 90 years ago. Actual newspaper clippings, reports from witnesses to the vicious attacks, testimonies from shark experts and local police chiefs add to the story and give it another element - this IS the truth, not fiction.	2004-01-14

The informative, but easy and readable style of this book will allow for many people to actually enjoy reading non-fiction about something they might have been required to study. The sections on how physically demanding the trek to Everest is were interesting. Amid all the IMAX films and articles, I'd forgotten what an amazing feat of the human body this is. It's very historical too, and hearing about the forgotten people who came before Sir Edmund Hillary was a treat. Coming from someone who has hiked up Everest himself, it makes the book all the more rewarding and fascinating. The author has been in all of these frozen, dangerous places! Excellent and informative.	2004-01-13

I'd want to call this book \\"beautiful\\".<br />Since her mother's suicide, Isabel has been in charge of the household and taking care of her siblings. Her father has withdrawn into himself, and her younger brother has found his own way of coping (with self mutilation). Meanwhile, she's making friends with precocious Mary Kelly, being pressured by her aunt to embrace her heritage by making the traditional recipe of Golai Hagun Sune, and another friend - Graziella - is preparing for a cockfight and beauty pageant!<br />The richly described setting is one of the best elements of the story - you feel like you're there, and the author gets completely inside the minds of all the characters and locals of the Pacific island. Come along for Isabel's journey of healing and acceptance, a fascinating glimpse of Guam and a heartwarming story.	2003-08-18

Her usually stern mother has fallen in love, and so has LaVaughn - with an old neighbour, Jody who's returned to their building once again. Jody's stirred up some new emotions in LaVaughn, making her think about love and romance all the time. And her best friends Annie and Myrtle are drifting away from her since they started praying all the time with the Cross Your Legs for Jesus group. LaVaughn's not sure about their new church. She's not too sure about anything at the moment. But she won't let anything distract her from college!

You will learn many things about the civil war, some about the Underground Railroad, and some about the conflicting politics of the north and south, Abraham Lincoln, his allies and enemies. It is filled with narratives from slaves, diary entries from prominent white politicians and abolitionists and accounts of African American contributions in many Civil War battles.<br />I don't normally read non-fiction for fun, but this was a worthwhile read, and we can still learn many lessons about tolerance and attitudes about racism today.	2003-08-18

But he has no choice but to go along since Mr. Hudson has proof that Roland was shoplifting. <br />When he gets closer to Jess Ferret (his target), Roland is instantly aware that something is very different about her, but he doesn't know what. He is sure that there is some kind of conspiracy involving Jess, his teacher, her missing parents, and a magician who haunts his dreams in a recurring nightmare. <br />This book is sometimes irritating to read due to the authors overuse of italics and showing us the characters thoughts (with repetitive questions like \\"What's going on? Why?\\" that quickly become annoying). It's certainly different, and it's not a bad story, but there are other books about discovery of magical prowess that are far more rewarding.	2003-08-06

We see Matt's fatherly pride and love as Mahalia says her first word, takes her first steps and grows up slowly, but surely.

It would be more difficult to hunt and observe the rites of passage in the high arctic lands. There was also the availability of alcohol - something that threatened to destroy their community. <br />Through her diary entries in the year 1924, when she is marooned on a remote island with a mapping expedition struck by disaster, Maata reflects on her life's adventures - from going to a boarding school in Quebec City, to learning English from a wizened old Inuit woman. <br />This book is a nice, easy read that will teach people many things about the culture of the Inuit and their history.	2003-08-06

But nothing could prepare her for a life changing event that happens at a bush party with her boyfriend. Dayle wasn't crazy about being around all the kids who were drinking, and how they made fun of the people she thought were her friends. But nothing could prepare her for the accident with the bonfire.<br />Dayle is badly burned and is in the hospital fighting to recover and trying to deal with the anger, sadness and everything happening to her. The beginning of this book seems a bit cliched, but it picks me up once you get going and becomes terrific and gripping.

But when he casually starts writing some words down on a page, and secretly borrows one of his writer father's poetry guides the exile starts to become more bearable. He slowly recovers, all the time writing about the death of his mother, past and present loves and his discovery of a whole new way of expressing himself. <br />If I had to describe this book in three words it would be 'short and sweet'. It's fun and cheerful (although I have to admit I didn't \\"get\\" the title until I was finished reading it).	2003-07-25

Meanwhile, he becomes a world wide sensation as everyone can't get enough of his inspiring posts. The only problem is that he posted it anonymously, and can't let anyone find out his true identity as Larry, not even his best friend, who he also happens to be in love with. I won't tell you how it ends.<br />It's thought provoking, thrilling, new and different from other novels and with a wide range of emotions. I became attached to the characters, and was sad, happy and mad at them and their experiences.<br />This book is a winner. Read it!	2003-07-16

Her home town of Smithers BC. Her weirdo parents.

He's been enlisted to fix up the dilapidated buildings when he'd rather be taking endless rolls of film and exploring the different angles and facets of photography.<br />As the summer progresses, he develops a friendship with Razzle Penney - weirdo extraordinaire, but great person and wonderfully crafted character. A relationship with sexy but shallow Harley threatens to ruin everything he has with Razzle and others in the small town. <br />You won't want to put this book down.

Boooring. It's stuff we already know from the story, but presented without the usual wit and humour that we've come to love Mia for. There's the occasional \\"funny\\" tidbit stuck at the bottom of the page, but the attempted jokes all fell flat.<br />I am not interested in hearing about how to do makeup or which forks to use. To me, that is not light, fun reading material. <br />I view this book in the same way I look at \\"Quidditch Through The Ages\\" and the Harry Potter spinoffs. Why couldn't the author have spent valuable time writing another good book in the series instead of wasting it with this?	2003-07-03

He didn't cry at the funeral, and he continued on like nothing had happened. His therapist Dave, urges Martin to be rebellious, get out some anger or emotion by having a tantrum or taking up smoking (Dave is not your average therapist). <br />Martin has his own ways of coping. He has authored a website, Emerso.com, which discusses everything under the sun (and changes depending on his mood) from Norway to Nietzche. But how long can he keep everything bottled up inside?<br />This book, like Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder, challenges the reader to think about their own morals and ethics and different philosophical ways of thinking. But it presents in a more humorous and readable way, one that will appeal to teens. This is a very powerful and interesting story about loss.	2003-06-30

Or have I just been exposed to higher quality YA fiction that makes this book a tad... one dimensional?<br />This is not a bad book. But for the first time, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the other ones in the series. Maybe I need to reread them to try and remember them better to get into the Alice groove. <br />Newly single, Alice throws herself into a multitude of extra curricular activities to get involved, make new friends and stop herself from missing Patrick. Complications arise when Pamela and Elizabeth are jealous Alice isn't spending as much time with them. To tell the truth, Alice and her friends sounded kind of shallow this time around. And the author's attempt at working in new information to help girls learn about their bodies felt very forced (oh, let's just casually talk about ovaries in the cafeteria). <br />I love all the characters dearly, and will probably continue reading this series because of that, but in my opinion, this book felt like it was missing something. It still makes me laugh, just not as much as I remember laughing at the earlier volumes. And we're still wondering who Lester will end up with (and Alice for that matter).	2003-06-29

What she got was something far more complicated. <br />Jolly was a seventeen year old single mom with 2 kids, Jilly and Jeremy who needed a babysitter desperately so she can hold on to her dead end job at a factory. Her apartment was messy and smelled bad. But something in the way Jeremy held LaVaughn's hand made her take the job anyway. She immediately develops a special bond with Jolly and her kids, and reading about the relationships between these characters, their stories and how they band together to make changes for the better is amazing.<br />This book is excellent. LaVaughn has a strong voice and the portrayal of the lives of the people in their situations is absolutely brilliant. Not only is it gripping, it has a message. <br />When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.	2003-06-29

Bobby is 16 and when his girlfriend Nia tells him she's pregnant, his world changes dramatically. Because of the unique way this single story is split into two time periods that meet at the end, you already know the ending (or so you think) but you don't know how events unfolded to get you there. <br />From sketches of Bobby's life before Feather is born to days when he is bone weary from caring for her in the absence of her mother, this book is excellent. The perspective of a single father raising a child is fascinating.	2003-06-27

Fans of the Harry Potter series will not be disappointed by this AMAZING installment. At least, this 14 year old fan wasn't.<br />Even with its gargantuan length, the book never gets dull. When the plot isn't roaring along at a fantastic and breakneck pace, we're left with great character development that gives us insight into the lives of some lesser characters (like Mrs. Weasley and Neville). Or some funny lines from Fred and George. Or more of what makes these books so great. The chemistry and the bond between the characters.<br />The book begins at Number 4 Privet Drive - where Harry is having a horrible summer. But one hot night, Dementors show up and suddenly Harry finds himself caught up in a giant misunderstanding (or is it) leaving him in danger of being expelled from Hogwarts!<br />But the book continues on and in a twist sure to leave readers outraged, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge turns out to be a completely evil piece of work bent on destroying everything about Hogwarts that Harry and his friends love so much - with special powers from the Cornelius Fudge, the delusional Minister of Magic who believes Dumbledore is out to get him and will stop at nothing to \\"reform\\" the school and get his own way. <br />Meanwhile, Hagrid is missing and nothing is turning out the way it should be. As you can probably guess, the action doesn't stop there. <br />Two things I did not like were the death scene everyone's been talking about (a big disappointment, I felt it was anticlimatic and not dramatic at all and not as good as I expected) and the scene where Dumbledore reveals \\"the truth\\" to Harry. The truth turned out to be something very obvious that most people probably already guessed by now - not a huge secret worthy of being on the back page. <br />There seem to be some small discrepancies in the story, but they will probably be explained later and do not have a large impact on the story.<br />But it's still worthwhile, and I haveto agree Harry Potter is worthy of all the hype.	2003-06-27

He does have a shady past, but wants to clean up and make a better life for himself. When the stories of these two collide, a fun and fast paced story (albeit one lacking a little bit in substance) results. <br />Jack becomes Draycos' \\"host\\", a symbiotic process where Jack gives Draycos the life force he needs, and Draycos helps Jack fight his way out of some sticky situations on the way to clearing his name and ultimately defeating the evil foes we get a brief glimpse of at the beginning of this book. They have some rip roaring adventures along the way. <br />The ending is an enormous cliffhanger (not to worry, as Zahn plans on making this a 6 book series). <br />Don't read this if you're looking for \\"serious\\" sci-fi.

At first Alex ignores Stacy, but after a class camping trip she begins to wonder if there's some truth to what Stacy's been saying. <br />Are the things going on between her and Simon just a special bond they have and a few accidents where she was in the wrong place at the wrong time? Or is Stacy right, and something perverted and gross is going on? Alienated from her best friends and unsure of how to talk to her parents or anyone else, Alex doesn't know where to turn and her confused narrative is a very gripping read. <br />Although I found this book a bit slow to start off, it got fairly good by the end. Sometimes it seemed a little juvenile, but overall it was an interesting, if imperfect book. Sexual absue is something that needs to be put out in the open, and \\"Friction\\" does a good job.	2003-06-20

US	32998194	R1GRF4BMIX9NIA	0152167056	324887263	A Northern Light	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A+	Jennifer Donelly writes a compelling, lively and interesting story with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting - 1906 in the Adirondacks (or as the protagonist, poor farm girl Mattie Gokey calls it, the North Woods). <br />Since Mattie's mother died, she's had to juggle roles as sister, housekeeper, student, breadwinner; and now that her handsome neighbour Royal seems to be showing puzzling interest in her - future wife. Mattie loves nothing more than reading, writing poems and stories and picking out a new word every day from the dictionary her mother bought with hard earned money before she died. But Mattie is tied down by the need to take care of her sisters, father and a promise she made, but desperately wants to break. <br />This story is told in flashbacks from Mattie's current job as hired help at the Glenmore Resort for wealthy tourists, where the entire town is caught up in the intrigue that follows the drowning death of a guest. Mattie knows something no else does, but is torn between loyalties to old promises and what others want her to do, and what she knows is right and she owes to herself. <br />You will not be able to put down this fantastic and well crafted read.	2003-06-20

But when he meets Shane, the toughest guy in the high school, who sells drugs and has killed before, everything changes. Andy sees the softer side of Shane, the one mourning his younger brother, who was killed with a breadknife. <br />Tommy is the school's golden boy. On the honour roll, soccer team; a cadet who wants to fly F-16s and is going places. But when his girlfriend Sheila breaks up with him, things slowly start unravelling and through the perspectives of these 4 guys, the story of pain unfolds. It's absolutely brilliant.	2003-06-20

It proceeds into their freshman year, where Sari falls in love with a popular senior who already has a girlfriend, and has an affair with him. This leads to angsty complications where Jess feels jealous, angry and hurt because Sari is always depressed or ignoring her. <br />I don't like Mariah Fredericks' writing style (although I think having imaginary quotes from Jess' favourite book that tied in with the chapter's content were an interesting idea) and I found all of the characters in this book to be annoying and stupid. Sari's actions defy all logic and intelligence, and Jess stands at the sidelines watching and moping around constantly. And a supporting cast of ... high schoolers surround them - from ditzy Erica Trager to geeky Danny. <br />During this book, I constantly wanted to grab the characters and knock some sense into them. <br />Despite its simplicity, boring style of writing, a character trying to be like feisty heroines from other (better) YA books like The Princess Diaries (whose author Meg Cabot gave a glowing recommendation of this book on the back, I have no idea what she was paid for it, but it must have been a lot) and dissing everything in her school, I actually wanted to find out what happened in this book. The ending was pretty good compared to the rest of the book, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br />Basic summary? A pair of melodramatic, stupid girls who need a slap upside the head star in a book sadly lacking in plot, originality or much of anything.	2003-06-15

Through a series of whimsical and beautifully crafted poems about God, Cynthia Rylant creates an endearing, thought provoking and enjoyable book. <br />These aren't your usual poems about God (as we think we know Him). God gets a dog, God gets cable, God goes to beauty school, God takes a boat ride, eats spaghetti and other random, but fascinating chapters. Just like the Joan Osborne song, this book asks \\"what if God was one of us?\\". How would he live and discover new things? It sounds silly, but it's anything but. It's short and sweet and different and everybody should read it. <br />My only criticism is that it was far too short, especially to buy in hardcover. But it's still a worthwhile read, even if you're not Christian.	2003-06-15
US	32998194	R1JJ8O2DSKP0EV	0749742585	371847738	The Flip Side	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Weird, but Interesting	I was able to read this book by buying the British edition. I didn't get a lot of the Britspeak , but the story made up for that. <br />Robert Hunt is a teen confused about his true identity. This book brings up some good points, especially for people confused or curious about who truly they are. It also brings up some interesting philosophical points. During a class discussion on Shakespeare, they talk about gender stereotypes and how boys would dress up to play girls roles in classical theatre. The story moves on to deal with Robert discovering his feminine side and his friend coming out about his sexuality - both topics not usually discussed in YA lit. I think the book handled them well. <br />I found this book too short. It wasn't perfect, but it was still a fairly good (albeit an easy) read.	2003-06-11

She's sick of her mother and gossipy small town neighbours trying to get her to be more ladylike. I found her views on everything amusing and fresh. <br />When Haley falls off the roof of her barn and breaks her leg, she's looking at a long, boring summer. I thought this book would be about her coming to terms with her injury, her father's death, her friend Frankie's schizophrenia. It's not. This is not just a coming of age story. It morphs into something reminiscent of \\"Nell\\", where she moves into the woods with her reclusive grandmother and shuts herself off from society for almost a year. As much as some readers will probably be weirded out by the drastic changes in plot and character, I was fascinated by the stories about herbal lore and how her grandmother is actually an age old spirit inhabiting the magical woods (I will say it once again: This is not your average coming of age story! It looks like general fiction, but it becomes fantasy almost). <br />If you told me how it ended when I first started the book, I would have been shocked beyond belief, but by the time I got there, I was used to the changes and found it really interesting. This book is certainly different, but this reader enjoyed it immensely.	2003-06-09
US	32998194	R1BEB2D4X1XD4O	0060523182	655483804	The Merlin Conspiracy	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Spellbinding	This book has a complicated, but interesting plot. The narration switches between two main characters telling the story - Roddy Hyde and Nick Mallory. Roddy is a magician in training in the mythical land of Blest (which is in a parallel universe and has many things in common with England). Nick Mallory appears to be a normal boy from our world, but in a surprise plot twist, you find out that he's actually a prince from another realm. <br />Imagine there's a parallel universe with a multitude of worlds separate from ours. The worlds are connected and have a lot of similarities and differences. Blest resembles England, but has its own unique personality. 2 kids from different worlds get drawn into a conspiracy that has the potential to affect the entire cosmos by disrupting the balance of magic in the universe (our world has magic too, most of us are too wrapped up to notice it). <br />One minute Nick is in London with his 'father' and the next he's in a faraway land where Roddy, with the aid of some powerful magic passed on to her by an ailing witch from another time and the guidance of her mysterious, solemn and reclusive grandfather, has summoned him to help her solve a problem she suspects is spiraling out of control. Roddy thinks that some power hungry witches and wizards (including Sybil, her best friend Grundo's scheming mother) are up to no good - and are plotting to overthrow the King of Blest. The Merlin seems to be in on it too (unlike our world, the Merlin is a title passed down to a deserving wizard when another Merlin dies), which distresses Roddy greatly - her grandfather Maxwell Hyde picks the Merlin! <br />A lot of the little things in the writing give this book (and others by Diana Wynne Jones) their own charming character. The Izzies were hilarious, as was Romanov's goat. And Mini the Elephant was a fun addition to the cast of characters (human and animal). This book is a winner!	2003-06-09

So they form The Loser's Club, a haven for other popularity challenged kids from their high school. It started off as a place to hang out and let off steam from being constantly tormented, humiliated and mugged. But it ended up as a place to fight for the rights and self esteem of losers everywhere, through the unlikely venue of a Christmas lights display competition. They face off against Whitman, with the help of Julie Spenser (hobbies? \\"brooding\\"), a rare girl who has befriended Alex. <br />The ending is predictable, but it doesn't matter because it's what you want to happen. I think this book would make a great movie. It's got lovable guys, great humour and a winning candid style. Thumbs up!	2003-06-09
US	32998194	RVGJYN1NYSW4J	0060012218	103393582	Geography Club	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Covers New Territory	Geography Club was a great and enjoyable read (I devoured it in a sitting) that I would recommend to everyone, especially people who need to become more accepting of homosexuality. It would be educational for many teens who have encountered only intolerance and might realize Russel isn't really any different from them. <br />Although I liked this book a lot, I felt that some elements of the story were a bit simplistic and certain things vaguely annoyed me. Why were his parents only passingly mentioned? And other things I can't quite put my finger on. All the characters seemed to be black and white, good and bad. Kimberly was evil. Most of the jocks were evil. Sometimes it felt a bit stereotypical.<br />But all in all, I think this was a good book.	2003-06-09

But it degenerated into something unrealistic, weird and silly. The ending was a complete let down.	2003-06-09

But until the pieces finally fall into place, it was a tad slow. <br />The author slowly builds up to the main action, something some readers may find boring. The book starts with Henry Atherton building a model of a flying pig (that actually flies. No explanation is given for this). Then he discovers that something has gone wrong in his life. It turns out his Mom's a lesbian who's been having an affair with his father's secretary. Certainly not an average occurance! But this is not an angsty 'teen problem' novel, which is what you'd expect that to happen in. It's a fantasy story about faeries interacting with humans and travelling between worlds. The lesbian plot development is a useless addition that was never expanded on like it could have been. <br />The book also follows Pyrgus Malvae, a faerie prince and his escapades in his world involving black magic and bad \\"faeries of the night\\". His feisty sister Holly Blue reminded me of Holly Short from the Artemis Fowl books. Strangely enough, this whole story seemed vaguely similar to the books (which is interesting, considering Eoin Colfer wrote glowing praise of this book on the back cover). <br />Henry, Pyrgus, Holly and a funny old man named Mr. Fogarty eventually meet up after a lot of disasters, espionage, demon summoning, trickery and portal mishaps. The result is an excellent conclusion begging for a sequel. You'll enjoy this book.	2003-06-09

I liked his honest and fun narration. At first this book felt like a mystery, then after the discovery and revelations take place, everyone has to deal with the consequences. I was completely drawn in. It felt real. <br />I didn't like the end of the book as much as the beginning and middle. During the Ded Beets Chapter I kept yelling at him to smarten up (which I suppose is a good thing, since I got so involved). <br />I highly recommend this book, especially to teenage guys (finally a book that most guys will like, most YA books I read are tailored more to girls).	2003-06-03

At first, I found it a bit hard to get into and I thought it might be weighed down with description, but it became captivating later on. I often forgot it wasn't really ancient Japan, the author's descriptions felt so real. I loved the intrigue and delicate balance of politics going on behind the scenes. <br />I also liked the fact that it was a tasteful ending to the first book, not a complete cliffhanger.

I don't think Ann Brashares is capable of writing anything other than a 5 star book.<br />It's more of the same - but in a good way. The ups and downs of the 4 girls through their summer. This one didn't make me cry like the first one did, but it was still addictive and well worth the money I spent on a hardcover copy. It doesn't feel repetitive or succumb to bad sequel syndrome. <br />I hope she makes it a trilogy!	2003-06-02

Martha Brooks is a wonderful author, and this book lives up to the high standard set by BONE DANCE. <br />I often have trouble sympathizing with characters like Noreen, who I sometimes find annoying. But this story drew me in completely and made me care about what happened to everyone. The characters of the elderly women were excellent additions to - it's not every day you find perspective like that in a YA novel. <br />I like bittersweet endings.	2003-06-02

The author should considering thinking of some major plot events that could happen in the next book and some truly original humour before publishing the next book. <br />I will probably still read the next installment, for a few cheap laughs and because I'm a sucker and want to find out what happens next, but my advice would be to wait until this comes out on paperback.	2003-06-02

I didn't find it spectacular, but it wasn't bad at all. The idea behind the plot is certainly an original one, and I liked Jordan's honest commentary of the things around her. The way she described Laylani, her mother, the people coming to Parrish Island, Big Mama and every aspect of her life was great. I didn't mind when she went off on a tangent telling another story, especially if it was about fiesty Grandpa Eugene.	2003-06-01

I don't think there is anything that could improve this book. The four intertwining stories about the girls fit together perfectly and their ups and downs and emotions are flowing and articulate. They can be thick at times, but you want the best for the characters and won't sit still until you know what's happened.<br />This is a \\"girl\\" book (as the marketing campaign for the sequel attests), but this guy loved it.	2003-06-01
