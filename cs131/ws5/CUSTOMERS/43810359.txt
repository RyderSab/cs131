Excerpts of Vermeer's childhood and experiences which would influence his work later on in his life are melded together, further on in the plane of time, with an abstract narrative of his journey to becoming an ingenious and respected artist in later years.<br /><br />The story casts shadows and light on the beautiful harmony, colour, and depth found in Vermeer's art, possibly enhanced by incorporating the use of a camera obscura, and utilization of de Vries' perspective and visual field.<br /><br />The final chronicle by the modern day art copyist delving into Vermeer's work and milieu as an artist, is the final `signature' to Howell's literary work of art.<br /><br />By and large, The Dance of Geometry is an engrossing piece of abstract work that is worth exploring in detail...not unlike Vermeer's own.	2004-08-23

Dancing between dark humour, stinging wit and poignant life realities, the author's recollections of her wildly outlandish family are often more bitter than sweet. To be sure, the collective confessions from the `Cullerton Family Crypt' will have you sobbing, guffawing, sighing, and feeling strangely schizophrenic - all in one chapter.<br />The truth is, Brenda Cullerton's family would raise anyone's eyebrow. At the forefront of these eccentric anecdotes are her parents - a social misfit mother who gardened in baggy black undies, lavish jewelry coupled with pop-it beads, and her hair bedecked in curlers; and an alcoholic father who was usually found anywhere but home, and amassed a hidden fortune as traveling businessman in the shoe trade (only to later hide his cash in their dilapidated barn, stuffed in the toes of moldy footwear).<br />Now in their winter years, Brenda Cullerton's parents - suffering from ill health - evoke her return to this alien landscape called \\"home\\". As the author painstakingly sifts through piles of family memories encountered along the way, not only does she learn more about these virtual \\"foreigners\\" who are family, but ultimately discovers herself and the all reasons for her insatiable desire to escape the past.<br />Artfully and intelligently captured on paper, it is Cullerton's ingenuous journey through introspection which makes \\"The Nearly Departed\\" quite nearly flawless.	2004-03-03

However, I was soon to discover that it is definitely a fitting and descriptive cover for the thespian narrative that unravels within. I was also taken unaware that this was a period piece, set in New England in the early part of the 20th Century - a fact I was all too happy to uncover, as I am an aficionado of period works.<br />\\"All He Ever Wanted\\" is a heart-wrenching account of unrequited love, obsession, jealousy and betrayal; exploring the most intense (and at times, darkest) workings of the human heart. Dreary and rather depressing, this candid narrative painstakingly chronicles a marriage of convenience gone sadly awry. It is written in the voice of Nicholas van Tassel, an English literary professor at a small college in New England as he ponders upon the memories of his fateful past...<br />One harrowing evening after escaping a restaurant fire, van Tassel happens upon the striking Etna Bliss and is instantaneously enraptured. Here commences their somewhat stifled and confusing courtship. Ultimately, their marriage forces each character to make critical compromises that will change their lives forever: Man gives up romantic ideal of marriage (knowing full well his wife does not love him) if only to `possess' her for himself; Woman relinquishes hope of marrying someone she loves and settles instead for a man who offers her freedom and a degree of independence (which is ultimately counterfeit).<br />Although the story is a little slow and one-dimensional at the outset, as the plot proceeds the reader will be taken in by the rich detail and character definition that quickly develops. The letters between certain characters were also a nice touch, allowing a glimpse into their personal thoughts - a unique perspective for the reader, digressing temporarily from the narrator's recital.<br />All in all, I must say I was thoroughly impressed by Shreve's shrewd portrayal of affections not reciprocated in &quot;All He Ever Wanted&quot;...it is a theme all too familiar in the human game of love.ing temporarily from the narrator's recital.  <br />All in all, I must say I was thoroughly impressed by Shreve's shrewd portrayal of affections not reciprocated in &quot;All He Ever Wanted&quot;...it is a theme all too familiar in the human game of love.	2004-03-03

Such was the case in a seemingly idyllic affluent community, the setting for Nancy Geary's second novel \\"Redemption\\" - a solid whodunit in the 'old school' style that will keep you guessing until the end.<br />When the beautiful, pampered debutante, Hope Lawrence, is found dead the day of her wedding, her visiting cousin Frances Pratt must work with the local police to unravel what is supposedly a clear-cut case of suicide. Little prepares Frances for what she discovers - shameful family secrets, and shrouded goings-on which the community itself is hiding behind its opulent veneer.<br />As a seasoned mystery fan, who hankers for a good Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes adventure, I admit to being fastidious over the quality of mysteries that I read. Modern-day thrillers in particular, are usually of little interest to me. However, Geary's suspenseful page-turner is a refreshing exception. While skillfully setting the scene for a most intriguing murder case, Geary weaves the tale so cleverly, it cannot fail to capture the reader almost immediately. The cast of convincing characters, each with a definite skeleton is his/her personal closet, is brought to life with amazing detail yet with an ease that makes them credible.<br />Everything else aside, Geary's novel has the added value of being highly readable. It is easy to become enveloped in the plot in just one sitting, pulled along by the delicious suspense and momentum found within its pages. I reached the last chapter of &quot;Redemption&quot; in few days, complete with accelerating pulse, perspiring hands, and a flurry of speculation. Well done, Geary.	2004-03-03

The narrative revolves around Ceridwen - a brave and beautiful young mother and wife, dealing with life during such a volatile period of time. Ceridwen of Kilton is a richly-woven tapestry of characters with great depth, beauty and strength. The tale holds an appeal to the human plight of survival and love. We agonize with the characters...the long (yet resolved) understanding between Sirroc the Dane and Ceridwen. The deep kinship yet brotherly rivalry between Godwin and Gyric...to mention but a few. The characters are hardly static, as they grow throughout the story. I especially enjoyed observing the persona of Gyric (Ceridwen's  husband), who advances from a inward lost soul, lacking self-confidence, to a strong stabilizing force of the Kilton foik, and a behind-the-scenes hero and leader.<br />The narrative itself is masterfully written and its complex historical details are a testament to a novel well-researched with much care. There are some parts in the book - explicitly sensual in nature - which I think the story could have done without. I personally did my best to skip these parts, for reasons of my own. It is therefore the reason why I don't think I could recommend this book to &quot;everyone&quot;. Yet, the plot and characters alone, stand testimony to a most intriguing and adventuresome tale.	2004-03-03

(Personally, it was Anne's diary that motivated me to write my own journal as a young girl and I continue to write faithfully, ever since. It is one of the few books that I've read which has had the greatest influence on my life.) Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl living in Amsterdam, along with her family, went into hiding along with her family during WWII, when Holland was annexed by the Nazis Regime. During the long years of secret captivity in the building's attic, Anne captured her hopes, loves, fears and thoughts on life in her diary, where she affectionately addressed her entries to an imaginary friend she named \\"Kitty\\".<br />Despite the horrible reality of war just outside her window, Anne was a person who could see beyond man's inhumanity to man, and perceive true beauty and the gift of life. Tragically, nearing the war's conclusion, the family's hiding place is mercilessly betrayed to the Nazis...which ultimately culminates in the final chapter of this lovely young girl's life, just prior to liberation. This is a true story...a diary of a young girl....and her voice from the past. It's a memoir of a brilliant and deep being who wasn't afraid to hope for something better, beyond the misery surrounding her. In my opinion, it is a book that every person should read.<br />It was an overcast day on Saturday, March 9, 2002. I stood just outside of Anne Frank's final dwelling place, the \\"Secret Annex,\\" at Prinsengracht 263, Amsterdam. I was overcome with great sadness as I gazed up at the small attic window where she must have looked out...a tree-lined canal just across the way. Perhaps she watched the ducks in the water, swallows overhead, the steady sloping of the rain, or the cloud formations....day in and day out. I imagined what it would be like to be a young girl in confinement, yearning to enjoy life amidst the free, only to be shut up, and kept quiet for fear that an audible breath would betray my family's whereabouts and terminate our lives. I wept at the great waste of life, the cruelty, the plundering of innocent lives, and how this amazing young woman maintained the inner strength to endure those years...and had the courage to capture it all with such delicacy, calm candor and beauty.quiet for fear that an audible breath would betray my family's whereabouts and terminate our lives.

It is by far, my favorite.<br />Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.<br />The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion.	2003-05-20

Indeed it was quite a captivating novel. A tad bit 'weak' at the outset, but as the story moved along, the plot thickened - and it evolved into a real page-turner.<br />A young man learns the story behind his father whom he was told had died long ago. Through his own investigations, the son finds that his father was wrongly convicted of a brutal murder 16 years earlier due to a miscarriage of justice, and was sentenced to life in prison.  The son learns the father is still in prison and has already served 15 years of his life sentence. After learning the facts, the son strives to clear his father's name. He eventually exposes a cover up by the police and the political system, which sought to frame his father for the horrible crime. I won't spoil the ending for you, but suffice it to say it was relatively a satisfying one.<br />I must admit there were some occurrences in the novel which seemed a bit dubious, however, nothing overtly outlandish took place that drew attention away from the story line. I would've liked a bit more characterization of some of the secondary characters - you don't learn too much about the way their minds work. You're also left wondering about the fate of some of the characters. For example, the boy's mother - who received almost ALL the focus at the outset, seemed to 'disappear' near the ending of the book.<br />However, I must say, overall it was well written in my opinion. This book was not heavy reading - it's one you're able to finish in a couple days...a good \\"weekend novel.\\"	2003-05-20

It is a story that exudes both tragedy and hope...love and hate...and the belief that everyone can start over with a `clean slate' if they have the courage and willpower to do so.<br />At the outset we are introduced to the main character, Jean Valjean, an atoned convict who reverses his wrong course in life and eventually develops into the benevolent and gentle Mayor of Montreuil (a prosperous small town in France).<br />Inspector Javert, who served as Valjean's prison guard decades ago in Paris, moves to the town of Vigo. Much to Valjean's dismay, Javert eventually recognizes the Mayor as an ex-convict. From then on, Inspector Javert swears revenge against Valjean - seeking to expose him as an ex-convict and have him taken into custody. This is in keeping with Javert's personal maxim: \\"once bad, always bad.\\"<br />After Valjean realizes Javert has recognized him, he goes into hiding after being entrusted with the care of a young orphan girl. Valjean and the little girl, who he raises as a daughter, restart a life of anonymity away from the bitter Javert (who will stop at nothing to recapture Valjean).<br />Almost a decade later, the obsessed Javert again catches up with Valjean and the reader is brought along on the adventure to a poignant culmination.	2003-05-20

Surrender to the quintessence of Provence! \\"A Year In Provence\\" chronicles Mayle's real-life experiences following his family's (wife and dogs) move from England to Provence. Their pages offer an entertaining and light-hearted narrative of everyday life -- the people, the climate, the landscapes, and mainly the acclaimed ProvenÃ§al art of eating! -- from the perspective of a British \\"long-term tourist\\" (as Mayle puts it). The Provence series is usually located in the \\"Travel\\" section at most bookstores; yet the discriminating reader will happily discover that these are more novel than guide. Mayle's storey-telling skills are top-notch and keep you reading until the book is done. This, coupled with his clever facetiousness, is a winning combination.

The author, Paterniti, mixes his own equation with words. The result? More than just a relative success, \\"Driving Mr. Albert\\" is a light and amiable concoction of humor, eccentricity, wit, poignancy, as well as raw and often highly amusing observation.<br />The ever-curious journalist (Paterniti) researches and finally meets Dr. Harvey, the mortician who performed the autopsy on Einstein in 1955. Scandal ensued when Harvey absconded and ultimately \\"disappeared\\" with the brain of the genius himself, claiming to be doing scientific studies to assertain if there were any unique facets to it. As Paterniti and Harvey's worlds collide, the result is far from prosaic.<br />Paterniti writes with such a personal flourish of his own, I was instantly captivated and found myself a passenger aboard his eccentric cross-country pilgrimage with Dr. Harvey and their third \\"passenger\\", Einstein's brain (bobbing in a formaldehyde-filled Tupperware container stowed in the trunk).<br />\\"Driving Mr. Albert\\" is the embodiment of the clich&eacute;: it's not the destination, but the journey that counts. As Paterniti and Harvey bomb towards California in a rented Skylark to rendezvous with Einstein's granddaughter, Evelyn, the author not only ascertains much about the contradictory persona of Einstein, and Dr. Harvey's fascinating life, but also about his own existence. The words I absorbed enraptured me in laughter, had me strolling down my own memory lane, and brought me near to tears during unexpected poignant scenes. The story and the intriguingly vivid characters, coupled with Paterniti's descriptive rhetoric made for an utterly arresting read. It's also makes for wonderful light weekend reading, as it's mere 211 pages will attest, and can be finished in a few sittings. With a plethora of these factors in its favor, I would not hesitate recommending \\"Driving Mr. Albert\\" to anyone who enjoys a truly entertaining anecdote, both deep and humorous.g \\"Driving Mr. Albert\\" to anyone who enjoys a truly entertaining anecdote, both deep and humorous.	2003-05-20

It is written by Douglas Coupland, the Canadian author best known for coining the term Generation X.<br />The novel is narrated in the form of a journal (which in itself is appealing to me) penned by the main character, Dan Underwood (26). To set the scene, the journal starts in the fall of 1993. Underwood serves as a computer programmer for Microsoft. The entertaining plot revolves around the misadventures of he and his fellow code-crunching computer whizzes. These self-professed 'geeks', obsessed with lego, and who often lament their lack of a social life, board together at a Microsoft &quot;dorm&quot;.<br />Otherwise known as &quot;microserfs&quot;, they spend 16-hour days coding, eating &quot;flat&quot; foods (ie. Kraft singles or fruit rollups, which are often passed underneath closed doors), and checking/sending email. Seizing the chance to be innovators and wanting to escape their Bill-run world, this intrepid bunch of quirky coders strike out on their own, as they form a high-tech gaming software company named Oop! located in Silicon Valley.<br />Spanning about 2 years, the novel lends us the complex and often hilarious story of what it's like for these coders, living together in a sort of digital flophouse as they desperately try to &quot;get a life&quot; and find love amid the dislocated, subhuman whir and buzz of their digitally-driven world.<br />I find Coupland's wit modern, funny, to-the-point and often thought-provoking. The novel itself is comical, illuminating and ultimately poignant. Indeed, literal tears welled up at the conclusion, which was an unexpectedly touching one. Admittedly, it is not a novel I would recommend to just anyone. Yet it is definitely a novel I personally wouldn't want to do without.	2003-05-20

What is the driving force behind this engaging novel? Sheer simplicity and the convincing thought processes of believable characters.<br />Harlow poetically depicts the life of a 14-year-old boy growing up in a small town located in British Columbia during the winter of 1930-1931. The reader is quickly drawn into Christopher Waterton's changing social environment as he undergoes his difficult and, often times, confusing metamorphosis to maturity. Throughout the novel, Christopher undergoes great change as he is confronted with life's hurtles. Meanwhile he struggles to cover new ground - perfecting his new found interest, his saxophone; his first love (Emily Gordon); peer pressure at school; and mounting family problems - all encompassed by a changing world scene on the brink of war.<br />&quot;The Saxophone Winter&quot; possesses an uncluttered poignancy that makes it unforgettable. It will appeal to readers of varying ages - the young, who may be encountering similar experiences and can relate to the foreboding frontier of growing up - or the more mature, who can look back wistfully on their past as they flip through Harlow's masterpiece.	2003-05-20

However, if you seek a deeply touching novel of intelligence and substance, indeed I urge you to read \\"Who Has Seen The Wind\\". It portrays the story of a prairie boy's initiation into the mysteries of life, as he discovers death, God, and the spirit that moves through everything: the wind. The plot details the little things in life that most of the masses overlook, and accurately relates the expressions and deep feelings of a young person growing up during the Great Depression. At the time I read it in school I could relate very easily to the primary character, Brian O'Connal. The novel's greatest strengths lie in its sensitive evocations of Brian's feelings, sometimes associated with his various experiences of death, sometimes with a child's fundamental, inarticulate but insistent curiosity to discover the world within and beyond himself. I was lost in the character's maturation and progression as a person. It is truly a book I will never forget. \\"Who Has Seen The Wind\\" definitely has contributed to the way I looked at life in general, as a young person at the time.	2003-05-20

It was a very heartfelt and sincere story about a young man named Daniel Mitchell, living in a world of his own. It was a peaceful life - an escape from reality that he created for himself, after he had been exposed to unspeakable violence in his early childhood. This realm of Daniel's remains untouched, until he meets worldly and somewhat cynical Rebecca. As a result, they learn much from each other. In this masterpiece, Williams has conveyed Daniel's thoughts, vulnerabilities, and deepest fears with such an indescribable intricacy that puts us in his shoes. Finally Daniel deals with the uprising of his past in his own way. I really enjoyed this book.	2003-05-20

It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty.

After living in an abandoned shack following their release, the boy and the girl who have grown up as friends, try to build normal lives in society. Albert, responsible, kind and sensitive, secures a job washing grafiti off walls and boarding with a middle-aged invalid, as her live-in caretaker. While Pettie, impressionable, brooding, flighty, and prone to acts of petty thievery, decides to apply for a nanny position at a manor - the home of wealthy widower Thaddeus Davenant and his small infant daughter. When Thaddeus' mother-in-law decides to move into the manor to care for the child, there is no longer a need for a nanny. Unstable and imagining herself in love with Thaddeus (who she has only met once), Pettie sets out to prove her love and compassion for him and the infant...in a somewhat distorted way. Albert is instinctively protective of his vulnerable friend Pettie, and ultimately tries to help her out of the desperate situation she soon finds herself in.<br />As the story unraveled in third-person, the reader is afforded a glimpse into each character mind.

It touched me deeply, personally...beyond mere words.<br /><br />\\"Facing The Lions\\" is an autobiography written in the voice of a young girl, Simone Arnold. Growing up in Alsace (a location on the French/German border), Simone is an astute and happy child surrounded by a close-knit and loving family. In time, her parents become Jehovah's Witnesses and Simone too makes the personal decision to embrace the faith with a fiery zeal and enduring fervor beyond her years, that would make any parent swell with pride.<br /><br />However, WWII is just around the corner, and trouble strikes when the Nazis annex the bordering French territory of Alsace, the home of the Arnold family. The Bibelforscher (Jehovah's Witnesses or \\"Bible Students\\" or as they were known then) in all of Nazi Europe are quickly put under ban.<br /><br />Being conscientious objectors in line with the scriptures' admonition \\"You must not murder\\", the steadfast Bible Students did not support the war effort in any way whatsoever. They refused to \\"Heil Hitler\\". As a result of their bible-based beliefs and their neutral standing, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps to suffer cruelly at the hands of the Nazi regime. Even though the Bibelforscher were given the opportunity to be released if they \\"simply\\" renounced their faith by signing a legal document, these ones remained steadfast and unmovable. Because of their unbreakable allegiance to God alone, and not the state, they became targets of the Nazis' rage and even their fellow citizens. However, their beliefs and firm reliance on Jehovah God helped these students of the Bible endure the oppression of the camps, some even to the point of death.<br /><br />As unwavering \\"Bibelforscher\\", the Arnold family was not immune to such horrors of the war machine. Soon after the war's outset, Simone's father is arrested and is taken away to the Dachau concentration camp and thereafter the infamous Mauthausen. Shortly after Simone is extradited to a strict Nazi reform school, her mother and aunt are also deported to the Schirmeck and Gaggenau camps.<br /><br />\\"Facing The Lions\\" is full of heart-rending experiences as Simone recounts physical and mental abuse at the reform school by those who outwardly and secretly conspired to break her spirit.

US	43810359	RLCJAEPXEW9T2	0345371135	234936263	The Quincunx	Books	3	5	10	N	N	Disappointingly lackluster and 2-dimensional	Reading Palliser's first epic, 'The Quincunx', is a bit like fishing - it requires a great deal of patience (and a good memory wouldn't hurt either). Whether or not the \\"catch de jour\\" is worth all the effort or not is entirely another story.<br /><br />Quincunx is a sprawling and ambitious drama set in early 19th century England. It takes the form of a narrative from the perspective of a young man who endures ruthless betrayal and misuse at the hands of countless relatives, with hopes of despoiling his inheritance. The plot is duly peppered with plenty of twists and turns, capable of confusing and puzzling even the most avid of bookworms.<br /><br />Granted, Palliser has obviously done his homework. Throughout the novel, he skillfully sets the scene with remarkable detail - sometimes too much so. As a result I found the actual story to be implausible and lacking any real depth, giving it a somewhat two-dimensional ambiance, amidst all of it's rich detail. With all the unnecessary minutiae, secondary characters, and behind-the-scene goings-on, Palliser easily lost the \\"heart\\" of the plot.<br /><br />All in all, I feel Quincunx is a bit too overdone for my literary taste. I prefer the subtle and mysterious to the blatant fanfare of melodramatic storytelling. It failed to connect with me on pretty much every level.<br /><br />Palliser has been hailed as the next Charles Dickens, but I honestly fail to see any striking resemblance in style to evoke such a worthy comparison. Quincunx was disappointingly lackluster...a mediocre read at best. Nevertheless, I can justify giving it a 3 star rating for Palliser's fine attention to detail, if nothing else.	2003-05-16
US	43810359	R2YU9CITEYD0DH	1888106832	515291300	Jackals In Iron	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Impressive rich detail!	Larsen's Jackals in Iron is a \\"must read\\" for the avid history buff and for those who have a hankering for distinguished story-telling at it's best. In impressive rich detail, every turn of the page expounds the history of the Norman incursion of England amongst other notable battles, chronicling the lives and actions of heroes, miscreants and citizens caught in the middle of life-altering movements of nations.<br />At the outset of the novel  (1100 A.D.), we become acquainted with the principal character - Count Guy of Ponthieu - a \\"worldly hardened warrior\\" advanced in age and held in high esteem by his comrades. Along with his youthful wife Estelle, the Count is invited on a sojourn to the abbey of Saint-Evroult, to recount his life experiences, scribed for posterity by the monks residing there. As he relates his past in detail (the atrocities committed during war, the conquests, the family conflicts, and the inner battles, etc.) to the eager party of copyists, we are treated to a retroactive narrative. We become deeply entrenched in the Count's read-worthy experiences, and consequences of his past decisions.<br />The reader is also generously provided with a glossary of terms, as well as lineage flow charts and maps, which I personally found very helpful in better understanding certain details of the story. They also added much the richness of the read. Without a doubt, the extensive detail and research that must have gone into penning such a novel will astound even the most picky of history aficionados.<br />Larsen unquestionably deserves the sincerest of kudos for this masterpiece. Jackals in Iron is highly recommended for those who prefer a more `meatier' read that is most enjoyable	2002-08-04

A truly enjoyable read, the tale is written with a sincere flare and comes alive to the reader.<br />More notably is the method in which Williams characterizes each member of the families involved in the story's plot - from the dueling heads, Mr. Dorset and Mr. Smythe, to Old Bob in his amusing stages of senility, and the ostentatious Jenny Dorset herself.<br />The reader will undoubtedly find the rich story line is highly entertaining, and written in a very lively manner. The tale is penned from the perspective of Henry Hawthorne, the Dorset's discerning and subdued family man servant. Hawthorne patiently abides by the family's somewhat eccentric and unruly lifestyle, and writes about his experiences first-hand, in memoir-like style.<br />Indeed, this novel is a great story-tellers' delight! The True &amp; Authentic History of Jenny Dorset manifests very engaging humour with every flip of a page - more than once have I been in the throws of violent chuckles over it's whimsical comments and situations. It has quickly grown to be one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.	2001-05-28
