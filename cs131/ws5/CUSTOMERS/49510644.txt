US	49510644	R11GZOWPA5IKV5	0974144304	784510850	The Holy Land	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A worthy first shot at SF satire	Science fiction pioneer Arthur C. Clarke has suggested that religion is a &quot;disease of infancy&quot;: a temporary malady that, at best, keeps the human race shackled to geocentric biases and, at worst, dooms us to premature extinction. &quot;The Holy Land,&quot; by Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin, is a scathing diagnosis of our collective predicament as seen through the lens of the modern Palestinian-Israeli conflict. <br />Zubrin's most famous work is the nonfiction treatise &quot;The Case for Mars,&quot; which convincingly demonstrates how travel to our neighbor planet could catalyze a new era of planetary discovery. The science and philosophy behind &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; were duly incorporated into his subsequent novel &quot;First Landing&quot;: a shaky but ultimately enjoyable hard-SF adventure. &quot;The Holy Land&quot; is something entirely different. Any pretext of realism is swept aside to make way for a slapstick geopolitical farce in which alien &quot;Minervans&quot; attempt to reclaim their ancestral homeland in the continental United States. Loathed by militant U.S. Christian Fundamentalists, the Minervans' conflict escalates into a galactic political melee. <br />This novel doesn't pretend to be subtle. References to Mid-East suicide bombings, bungled attempts at negotiation between Israel and Palestine and the September 11 attacks are glaringly obvious. Herein lies &quot;The Holy Land's&quot; central weakness: If the action and dialogue read as convincingly as a shoot-'em-up comic book, how seriously are we to take Zubrin's barbs? From a comedic standpoint, Zubrin demands that we actively participate in his farce. While this is a good technique for drawing readers into the book's plot, it's simultaneously alienating. <br />Not that Zubrin's barbs aren't good ones. Though far from misanthropic, Zubrin views our species as a squabbling, violent and largely ineffectual lot. The central conflict between the crooked U.S. government and the quasi-Zionist Minervans is presented as a microcosm of the human spectacle. Through the eyes of his civilized galactic visitors, Earthlings are little more than oafish, smelly cattle possessed by disgusting habits and backfired ideologies. Ironically, the star-crossed romance that comes into its own in the novel's second half is orders of magnitude more substantial -- and culturally indicting -- than &quot;The Holy Land's&quot; various political intrigues. <br />&quot;The Holy Land&quot; may ultimately lack the staying power of &quot;The Case for Mars.&quot; But for those of us who feel as if the world is in the throes of apocalyptic insanity, Zubrin's book provides welcome reassurance that we're not alone.	2003-12-05

As one of the case's few on-site researchers, Stanford is uniquely qualified and pursues the truth behind the landing with dogged persistance, interviewing the key players -- foremost among them policeman Lonnie Zamora -- and formulating sensible questions. <br />&quot;Socorro 'Saucer'&quot; is a superior piece of ufological sleuthing; perhaps its most valuable contribution to the field is Stanford's meticulous, scientifically informed analysis of the landing site. The implications of the Socorro landing are multiplex and Stanford does an admirable job of zeroing in on the salient issues. After reading &quot;Socorro 'Saucer',&quot; there is virtually no doubt in my mind that the Socorro incident was a physically real event involving an apparent craft of extraordinary manufacture. This is a fascinating, grounded volume well worth seeking out.	2003-09-14

In it, he explores near-term breakthroughs in neuropharmacology (i.e., Prozac, Ritalin, Zoloft), genetic screening and the looming prospect of germ-line genetic engineering, which could conceivably fracture the human race beyond recognition a la Aldous Huxley's cautionary masterpiece &quot;Brave New World.&quot; Fukuyama is an engaging polemicist who knows biotechnology and harbors understandable reservations about its potential. So perhaps it's surprising that I don't agree with his thesis. <br />Much of &quot;Our Posthuman Future&quot; is devoted to Fukuyama's case for &quot;human nature&quot; and &quot;human dignity.&quot; One can hardly blame him; the technologies he describes pose grave existential questions for the human condition. We may very well evolve into a &quot;posthuman&quot; stage of being. My central problem is Fukuyama's negative reading of the term &quot;posthuman&quot;; though he applauds biotech breakthroughs that have prolonged and improved human life, he equates &quot;posthuman&quot; with the soulless &quot;happy slaves&quot; of dystopian science fiction. He seems unable or unwilling to foster the notion that willfully upgrading the human species through psychotropic drugs or genetic intervention might result in a legitimate long-term improvement. Fukuyama accomplishes his literary mission by vigorously defending what he terms &quot;human nature.&quot; To his credit, he gives us a robust historical model of what it means to be human, citing philosophers from Aristotle to Nietzsche and even name-dropping roboticist Hans Moravec and artificial intelligence advocate Ray Kurzweil. But he refuses to acknowledge that the definition of &quot;human&quot; is conceivably in our hands and not the exclusive domain of blind natural selection, thus ignoring the opportunity to develop an authentically new transhumanist philosophy. <br />Any reader will naturally sympathize with the impending bioethical controversies scrutinized in &quot;Our Posthuman Future.&quot; For example, will germ-line engineering lead to a race of superhumans and, if so, what happens to the founding principles of liberal democracy? Will parents of the near-future screen prospective embryos for desired characteristics, resulting in a genetic aristrocracy? Unfortunately, Fukuyama's arguments are rendered toothless by his unwillingness to challenge the prevailing biomedical paradigm, which seeks to treat the sick yet leave well enough alone. For Fukuyama, death is not merely acceptable in a society of potential immortals, but confirmation of &quot;human nature.&quot; Predictably enough, he ends his book with a rallying cry for increased governmental precautions and legislation against technologies that might revise his quaint definition of &quot;human.&quot; <br />To be sure, &quot;Our Posthuman Future&quot; is worth reading. Fukuyama is intelligent and sincerely cares about the future of humanity and civil liberty, which is more than can be said for many of his contemporaries. But even his best arguments are burdened with thinly disguised neophobia.	2003-09-12

In \\"Tomorrow Now,\\" his first book-length nonfiction work since the dated but fascinating \\"The Hacker Crackdown\\" (a tome on computer crime and digital culture written in the Internet's infancy), Sterling envisions the trends, technologies, and mutant ideologies that will define the first half of the 21st century. <br />\\"Tomorrow Now\\" is Sterling at his chatty, global-headed best. He writes about the future with skill and heartfelt exuberance, avoiding the perils of dystopian science fiction. Readers expecting biotech holocaust or maurauding robots will probably be disappointed in Sterling's close-to-home approach. But for readers into the political ramifications of computer networks, \\"ubicomp,\\" and postindustrial design philosophy, \\"Tomorrow Now\\" delivers in spades. <br />The future, in Sterling's eyes, is merely an alternate way of looking at history. As such, it's an artifact of our own desires and creative stamina: a perplexing realm where \\"dystopia\\" and \\"utopia\\" blend and ignite with incandescent results. True to his science-fictional visions, \\"Tomorrow Now\\" is both laugh-out-loud funny--read his commentary on the pervasive techno-ecology of pseudo-organic \\"blobjects\\"--and grimly cautionary. \\"Tomorrow Now\\" unveils a world that thrives off future-shock, held together by neobiological systems and threatened by greenhouse catastrophe. Along the way, we meet angst-ridden clones, digitally savvy terrorists, and our own posthuman descendants. <br />\\"Tomorrow Now\\" is imminently readable, thoughtful, and soundly structured. Required reading for postcyberpunks and curious bystanders alike.	2003-01-20

Colin Bennett's &quot;Politics of the Imagination,&quot; a heady examination of the life, work, and ideas of paranormal heavyweight Charles Fort, is a rich and singular book in which Bennett's postmodern sensibilities are brought to bear on one of the 20th century's most radical thinkers. Fort, an intellectual outcast who viewed science as so much socio-mythological advertising, has become synonymous with the unexplained. Bennet argues that &quot;Fortean&quot; phenomena such as UFOs, inexplicable artifacts, and falls of live fish reveal cracks in the buttresses of Big Science's illusory (and ever-fashionable) rationalism. <br />Bennett, like Fort, views reality itself as an anomaly to be held in constant question; &quot;explanations,&quot; if available at all, are only a superficial means of understanding. Bennett grabs hold of the enigma that is Fort's iconoclasm and doesn't let go. Summoning a mass of scientific and literary esoterica, he writes with impeccable wit, pursuing his quarry with impressive dexterity. &quot;Politics of the Imagination&quot; is a high-calorie intellectual banquet of a book: challenging, learned, and incredibly fun. As long as Bennett is writing, Western empiricism can run, but it can't hide. With a foreword by John Keel, author of &quot;The Mothman Prophecies.&quot;	2003-01-10

Among other items, fiber optics and integrated circuit chips are allegedly the fruits of Corso's efforts. Corso's account is meticulous but leaves many questions unanswered. The author verifies the existence of the infamous, oft-doubted MJ-12 working group and offers the possibility that the &quot;aliens&quot; found at Roswell were in fact time travelers from Earth's own future, raising some bizarre questions: if the &quot;aliens&quot; came to 1947 using technology which we in turn injected into contemporary industry, then where--or, more accurately, when--did the technology come from in the first place?	2002-12-19

His characters have the depth of cardboard, the dialogue is often hilariously stilted, and the prose is riddled with cliches and irrepressible sentimentality. But I really liked this book. For its failings, it has a page-turning premise and a taut, charged plot; I read &quot;First Landing&quot; in two sittings and enjoyed every moment of it. Zubrin's tale of a near-future mission to Mars contains some satisfying moments (including a believably cynical portrait of Washington politics) and not a little genuine excitement. &quot;First Landing&quot; isn't the sleekest Mars novel to roll out of the hangar, but it tells a good story, and Zubrin's enthusiasm is infectious.	2002-12-19

Clement's smooth dialogue and well-realized technologies make &quot;Half Life&quot; worth reading, but his peculiarly colorless portrait of deep-space is disconcerting at best. Clement begins with a gruesomely potent premise: Earth's population is being killed off by rapidly evolving diseases. Hope rests in the not-quite-expert hands of a terminally ill team stationed in orbit above Saturn's moon Titan, who hope to find prebiotic clues to explain the epidemics back home. What follows is an often numbing mass of scientific pontification as the chemist-astronauts pilot telerobotic ramjets to and from the Titanian surface. While Clement is a skilled storyteller, he fails to give the reader any particular reason to want his characters to succeed; his future Earth, when addressed at all, is an abstracted concept, and his characters little more than mouth-pieces for Clement's endless supply of facts and figures. (How many times do we really need to know the wind direction on Titan in exacting detail?) Conceptually interesting but stilted in execution, &quot;Half Life&quot; showcases both the merits and potential pitfalls of &quot;hard&quot; SF.	2002-12-06

Reynolds' highly stylized cosmological detective story is conceptually fascinating and becomingly moody; the author whisks readers from the ruinous, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-like urban wilderness of Chasm City to the vertiginous, rat-infested corridors of the starship Nostalgia for Infinity, revealing a future history as interesting and plausible as that of Ken MacLeod (&quot;The Stone Canal,&quot; &quot;The Cassini Division&quot;) and Peter F.

The authors approach the abduction enigma as a challenge to conventional thought, leaving the verdict to the reader. &quot;Without Consent&quot; is a short, sensible primer that shines a much-needed light on the state of UFO research in the UK.	2002-11-05

As such, it's reasonably informative. But Bramley's thesis--that beings from UFOs are responsible for corrupting human politics in order to keep us occupied with endless Orwellian conflict--is so weak as to be laughable; I personally suspect the sensationalistic ET angle was suggested by the book's publishers and grafted into the text at the last minute. Bramley's book is annoying in several other respects. He ceaselessly condescends and pretends to the role of \\"spiritual mentor,\\" matter-of-factly criticizing world religions and how they fail to address humans as \\"spiritual beings.\\" \\"The Gods of Eden\\" is so thoroughly soaked in Bramley's own belief system that it sometimes reads as conspiratorial self-parody, complete with seldom-seen alien invaders as cosmic scapegoats for humanity's every failing. Toss in CIA mind-control, scheming international bankers, the alternative archaeology of Zechariah Sitchin, and near-death experiences, and \\"The Gods of Eden\\" achieves a certain rambling charm. Read Bramley's self-congratulatory tome with the biggest salt-shaker you can lift.	2002-11-03

Superficially, &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; can be read as a biography of the late flying saucer contactee George Adamski, but it's much more; Bennett probes the innards of 20th century society with an intellectual and literary dexterity seldom encountered in popular works on UFOs. Bennett treats Adamski's bizarre story as the multilayered mythological enigma that it is, recreating the circumstances in which Adamski, good-natured opportunist and hobbyist astronomer, supposedly met a man from Venus. Bennett argues that Adamdki's claimed contact rattled Western society's ontological bedrock, regardless if it actually happened. There aren't very many books that address reality-challenging issues as ably or as wittily as Bennett's. &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; is a must for anyone seeking the roots of the postmodern condition, and destined to be a classic.	2002-10-28

Historian Richard Dolan's &quot;UFOs and the National Security State&quot; is an unsparing chronological narrative that charts the UFO enigma (and its disturbing relationship with the US military-industrial complex) from the beginning of the modern phenomenon to 1973. Dolan's book is as intelligent and sober as it is mind-boggling, written with a welcome sense of irony and rooted in documented fact. Dolan revealingly juxtaposes the UFO phenomenon with its Cold War context, shedding light on the military's early search for answers, NICAP's tireless efforts to bring the UFO issue to Congressional attention, the duplicitous tactics of Project Blue Book and the Condon Report, and much more. &quot;UFOs and the National Security State&quot; is a unparalleled work by an author not afraid to challenge &quot;official history&quot;--even if it means exposing an enigma that defies conventional explanation. I predict that Dolan's study will become a genuine classic; he's raised the bar for scholars of the UFO coverup, and offers a remarkably solid argument to the intellectually fashionable &quot;debunking&quot; establishment. This book redefines the 20th century landscape; I eagerly await the second installment in Dolan's peerless overview.	2002-10-28

In finishing &quot;Flight,&quot; the first part of &quot;The Naked God,&quot; Peter Hamilton has given himself a huge challenge: completing the Night's Dawn series in a manner that reconciles his far-flung sub-plots, makes sense of the somewhat incomprehensible &quot;reality dysfunction&quot; his heroes are trying to divert--and doing so without the condescension he's proven remarkably good at avoiding so far. Arguably the most entertaining installment yet, &quot;Flight&quot; introduces the enigma posed by the alien Kiint and Tyrathca races, whose wanderings through the galaxy may hold the clue to humanity's survival. Al Capone's interstellar mafia features big in &quot;Flight&quot; (a little too big, in this reviewer's opinion), and the quest of satanist bad-guy Quinn Dexter finally comes into its own, plot-wise. Ironically, Dexter's character is one of the weaker links in Hamilton's epic. For a transdimensional messiah bent on destroying the universe, Dexter comes across as little more than a screwed-up teenager who's listened to too much Marilyn Manson. Shortcomings are possibly inevitable for a work of this length (and yes, it's possibly a little too long, although I won't complain). But for every failing, Hamilton is able to dish up some hugely entertaining (and often thought-provoking) scenarios. The storming of the derelict Tyrathca arkship in the book's later chapters is especially well-crafted, as are Louise and Genevieve's exploits on an environmentally devastated future Earth. Consistently impressive in scope and plot, &quot;Flight&quot; is a good read that promises big rewards.	2002-01-02

Originally published as a trilogy, Peter Hamilton's Night's Dawn sequence (published in the U.S. in six fat volumes) represents state-of-the-art space opera that makes up for in pace and sheer storytelling energy what it lacks in style. The first installment introduces us to the dualing doctrines of the neo-fundamentalist Adamists and telepathic Edenists (an ideological gulf suspiciously similar to that of the Shapers and Mechanists of Bruce Sterling's excellent &quot;Schismatrix&quot;). Hamilton's galaxy-spanning conflict is well-realized and fascinating, even if his characters occasionally succumb to the one-dimensional predictability of their pulp-fiction predecessors. &quot;Emergence&quot; is a promising far-future romp that successfully breathes new life into the much-chewed turf of galactic conflict and promises a lot of fun; I'll read later installments with interest. <br />Hamilton continues his bold galactic tale in &quot;Expansion.&quot; The second half of &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; is without doubt the best, and an absorbing reward for readers who decide to tag along after the introductory material covered in &quot;Emergence.&quot; Brimming with capably written action sequences and harrowing excursions into uncharted interstellar depths, &quot;Expansion&quot; manages to boost the Night's Dawn sequence into literary escape velocity. Hamilton's main goal in writing this series is to tell a story, and he succeeds brilliantly, maintaining a sense of suspense while juggling a vast cast of characters and alien environments. A sort of cyberpunk fusion between Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; and Isaac Asimov's &quot;Foundation,&quot; &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; is one of the most enjoyable and refreshingly unpretentious sagas to grace science fiction bookshelves in a long time. <br />&quot;Consolidation,&quot; the first part of the second installment in Hamilton's sprawling Night's Dawn sequence, sees the characters and situations of the first two-part novel thrust deeper and farther into intricate and deftly balanced storylines. As the series matures and gathers momentum, Hamilton is able to develop and humanize his protaganists; more than before, the characters seem real enough to actually root for. Fortunately for readers who have made it this far, Hamilton manages to counter his incendiary action sequences with existential paradox and fiendish genre-crossing sensibility. The result is a completely arresting widescreen fiction experience that raises profound questions while maintaining a consistently high level of suspense. Hamilton's series is staggering in its kinetic, playful vision, and &quot;Consolidation&quot; leaves us thirsting for more.	2001-11-28

While Maccabee's treatise-written-as-a-novel may fail somewhat as a piece of literature (the characters are basically props on which to erect the author's ufological insights), &quot;Abduction in My Life&quot; succeeds wonderfully in introducing the reader to the bizarre world of UFO sightings and the implications of contact with nonhuman intelligence. A crisply written nonfiction book is interwoven in Maccabee's narrative, nicely complimenting the fictional abduction investigated by the protaganist. <br />Maccabee saves the best for the final chapter, in which Maccabee's alter-ego (?) Dr. Mac Sargent takes us on a first-rate ontological crash-course, framing the UFO/alien problem in its cosmic and societal contexts. Do we dare admit the presence of alien craft in our skies? What does the UFO phenomenon tell us about our species' past? Will homo sapiens survive the next millennium? Such questions form the heart of this book. Maccabee's speculations are sanely presented and mentally invigorating. &quot;Abduction in My Life&quot; is a brisk yet erudite introduction to the subject of alien contact.	2001-11-20

MacLeod's often dense and obtuse near-future political wrangling is intriguingly juxtaposed with some of the best technological extrapolation in the genre; MacLeod uses genre conventions (i.e. robots, androids, superhumans, extraplanetary colonies) to deconstruct the machinations of allegiance and the role of personal volition in society. &quot;The Stone Canal&quot; is arguably a better novel than the excellent &quot;The Cassini Division,&quot; if a bit more difficult.

The issues tackled in &quot;The Abduction Enigma&quot; are not new, but Randle, Cone and Estes handle them with rare sensibility. Methodically addressing the researchers and writers who have made &quot;alien abduction&quot; a household term, the authors make a convincing case that the apparent outbreak of close-encounters in the 1980s and '90s is largely, if not completely, the result of an epistemilogical breakdown between experiencers and those determined to fulfill their own beliefs by clothing dream imagery in the fabric of established fact. This is a very compelling read that skillfully highlights the flaws with abduction research as practiced today, although I predict students of the phenomenon will likely come away with more questions than answers. While &quot;The Abduction Enigma&quot; doubtless contains pieces of the puzzle, I'm unconvinced that it has all of them. Nevertheless, ufology stands in debt to the authors for providing us with so unflinching a perspective.	2001-08-29

Continued in the addictive &quot;The Siege of Eternity&quot; and concluded in the breezy, exciting &quot;The Far Shore of Time,&quot; Pohl does an admirable job of revising the cliched theme of alien invasion. There are some minor let-downs in the plot--the most obvious being the nature of the alleged &quot;Eschaton&quot; the invading aliens are fighting over--but I found myself enjoying the trilogy for its knowing, behind-the-scenes portrayal of the world's intelligence communities caught unprepared in a struggle at the threshold of comprehension. Greg Bear has referred Pohl's far-flung adventure as &quot;the thinking person's 'Independence Day.'&quot; I recommend the Eschaton trilogy to anyone searching for a diverting, intelligent adventure about a &quot;first contact&quot; scenario that could actually happen.	2001-08-29

The authors take us on a rigorous journey from dry and inhospitable Mars (where the remains of an apparent extraterrestrial civilization beckon) to Earth of the early 21st century, poised on the edge of ecological catastrophe as a result of global warming. Is our planet heading for the same fate that befell Mars, our closest planetary neighbor, and if so, what can we do about it? The questions raised by Brandenburg and Paxson are as horrifying as their proposed remedies are optimistic; Brandenburg, a plasma physicist, urges the development of clean fusion technology to take the place of our suicidal fossil fuel economy. <br />Urgent and arresting, &quot;Dead Mars, Dying Earth&quot; has already been called the &quot;Silent Spring&quot; of the new millennium. Read either as a behind-the-scenes expose of the forbidden science of planetary SETI or as an erudite work of comparitive planetology, this unflinching look at what our species is doing to our planet deserves a vast audience.	2001-08-10

Pflock's thorough exploration of the events of July, 1947 are revealing, insightful, and--best of all--credible. &quot;Roswell&quot; is healthy skepticism with muscle and intellect, and a positively delicious read for truth-seekers disillusioned by Kal Korff's whiny, unconvincing tome on the subject. <br />Like Pflock, I've long been a Roswell agnostic. The evidence assembled here has, I'm afraid, pushed me into the skeptics' corner for good. Maybe I'm wrong--and, to be sure, there's always that slightly disturbing wish that I am--and new evidence will surface that makes the extraterrestrial crash hypothesis more attractive. In the meantime, Pflock's work is very likely to remain the definitive resource on the subject. <br />There's only one catch: to appreciate &quot;Roswell,&quot; it's best to be versed in dissenting opinions.

Not since Whitley Strieber's seminal best-selling &quot;Communion&quot; have I read a book that addresses the issue of nonhuman intelligence with such humility and restraint (traits lacking in recent books on the subject, such as David Jacobs' insipidly literal &quot;The Threat&quot;). Mack argues that alien encounters, while subjectively real to experiencers, probably reflect a much more sophisticated model of reality than Western empiricism currently allows. In other words, abduction experiences are likely not &quot;real&quot; in the traditional sense of flesh-and-blood extraterrestrial visitors conducting unsolicited health check-ups (an interpretation exploited by skeptics eager to downplay the reality of alleged alien encounters). <br />Mack takes time to address the issue from an indigenous perspective, drawing on testimony from experiencers in Africa and South America. The parallels, he reveals, are as startling as they are productive. In them, Mack concludes that we are indeed coming into contact with a largely (though not entirely) unrecognized intelligence that appears to antedate space-time as we know it. <br />Mack is to be applauded for his skepticism and determination in helping our understanding of what is perhaps the most misunderstood phenomenon in the world today. &quot;Passport to the Cosmos&quot; is a landmark book in a field with too few reasoned perspectives and way too many unbounded imaginations.	2001-02-01

Loaded with biographies, historical notes, book reviews and longer chapters that delve into territory familiar to readers of Randle's other books, the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is an admittedly biased effort on the part of Randle; the conclusion one tends to reach after plowing through this tome is that something weird indeed happened outside Roswell Army Air Field in the summer of 1947, and that this weirdness is most easily attributed to a spacecraft crash. <br />The question that naturally arises is whether Randle's bias is grounded in fact or wishful thinking. To Randle's considerable credit, he devotes quite a few pages to Roswell detractors, quoting lengthily from Kent Jeffrey's skeptical &quot;expose&quot; in which he claims to have eliminated the possibility of a UFO crash once and for all. Also available for curious readers are references to most of the competing Roswell literature. All said, this is a practical reference for the curious, while students of the Roswell case are liable to digest it in one or two sittings (I write from experience).	2001-02-01

Annotated by Ballard, the expanded edition of &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot; includes three &quot;stories&quot; detailing cosmetic surgery on celebrities and a witty science-fiction yarn about Ronald Reagan's third Presidential term. Ballard's prose is disquietingly precise. <br />Other recommended Ballard: &quot;The Wind from Nowhere&quot; (his harrowing first novel), &quot;The Unlimited Dream Company,&quot; &quot;Memories of the Space Age,&quot; &quot;Chronopolis,&quot; &quot;The Best Short Stories of J.G.

US	49510644	R3D693QB93E8UD	0929480449	42622924	Silicon Embrace	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Kinetic and funny	&quot;Silicon Embrace&quot; is a demented alien invasion story and one of the better cyberpunk novels of the 1990s: loopy, graphic and ambiguously funny, drawing on fifty years of flying saucer lore and--ingeniusly--making it all interesting in unexpected ways. Shirley's hyperkinetic vision of a fractured, anarchic United States steeped in the mythology of the late 20th century is terrific. This novel is an overlooked must-read for students of that nebulous field we call &quot;ufology.&quot; Like Robert Anton Wilson, Shirley bravely opens doors for the sheer literary pleasure of seeing what's on the other side, waiting and ready to pounce.	2001-01-31

The brilliance and terror behind this straight-forward tale is Shirley's refreshing refusal to cling to genre conceits. &quot;City Come A Walkin'&quot; challenges the nature of identity as well as the parameters of urban morality.	2001-01-31

And while it's difficult to take much more than a passing interest in Noon's cast of junkie heroes, &quot;Vurt&quot; can be appreciated as a meditation on influences. William Burroughs is most definitely here, making &quot;Vurt&quot; one of the very few novels possibly derserving the overused title &quot;The 'Naked Lunch' of the 90s&quot; (a praise also lavished on David Foster Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;). <br />&quot;Vurt&quot; lacks Burroughs' virulent wit and--perhaps needless to say--the prose pales in comparison with Gibson's cyberspace novels. But it achieves a measure of newness, and the tropes it messes with are granted a surreal bent that doesn't take itself overly seriously; while &quot;Vurt&quot; could have steeped itself in style for the sake of style, it instead opts for a certain playfulness.	2001-01-31

Maitland quickly realizes that he's stranded, and the rest of the novel deals with his persistent efforts to escape and claim the &quot;island&quot; as his own before re-emerging into civilized society. <br />&quot;Concrete Island&quot; is an inventive and horrifying story that illuminates the thin line between savagery and civility as deftly as &quot;Crash&quot; dissected our collective fetish for the mechanical. Ballard's thoughts on the modern predicament are as insightful as they are chilling, and &quot;Concrete Island&quot; ranks among his finest visions.	2001-01-31

Superficially, &quot;Dhalgren&quot; tells the story of an amnesiac protagonist who finds an identity of sorts amidst the corrupt and tantalizingly beautiful ruins of a fictional city that has isolated itself from the rest of the United States. <br />Like the prose itself, Delany's city is restless and deliberately undefined, the nature of its cataclysm never divulged. Meanwhile, Delany explores sexuality, race and fame with rare candor. We learn to accept Delany's experimental necropolis as the enigma it is. &quot;Dhalgren&quot; is a gem, as personal as it is strange and easily the best work by Delany I've read.	2001-01-31

Written with a practiced mix of anger and nostalgia, &quot;The Place of Dead Roads&quot; is like a prison confession written in some other dimension, a rollicking synthesis of Burroughs tropes old and new. Join Kim Carsons on his nightmare quest to rid the planet of its addictions: it's a surreal and haunting literary journey, the last 100 pages of which witness Burroughs at his visionary best.	2001-01-31

Ballard's apocalyptic landscapes. Like voyeurs, we're ushered into a world of flickering volcanic fires, leaking hotels and anxiety-run-rampant in the tradition of DeLillo's &quot;White Noise&quot; and Pynchon's &quot;Vineland.&quot; <br />&quot;Amnesiascope&quot; is far more than a meditation on nightlife. Erickson's meticulously wrought characters are what propels this odd, gorgeous book. At once experimental and character-driven, &quot;Amnesiacope&quot; succeeds in its well-honed balance between landscape and psyche, empathy and urban detachment. There wasn't a moment I didn't like; &quot;Amnesiacope&quot; stands as one of the most moving near-future novels to have graced the genre.	2001-01-31

John Hackworth is a brilliant nanoengineer whose masterwork, a hypertext called &quot;A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer,&quot; falls into the hands of Nell, a resourceful young girl who finds her life forever changed. Stephenson conjures up a fascinating cast of characters, giving readers an intimate portrait of a world living on the razor's edge of tomorrow's technology. &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; is a kaleidoscopic, visionary work of steadily escalating strangeness.	2001-01-31

DeLillo treats us to a surrealistic suburban fable, a love story, an existentialist discourse and a chillingly plausible science-fiction yarn--all in the same book. &quot;White Noise&quot; is the quintessential postmodern novel, with a likeable hero that makes the subject matter (death, the &quot;waves and radiation&quot; of the popular media, ubiquitous electronic devices) involving and immediate. DeLillo writes with a high-resolution eye for detail and a firm grasp of character (Jack Gladney's heady discussions with his Elvis-teaching fellow professor are particularly interesting). The novel's climax is disconcerting...but so is the garish, out-of-kilter world DeLillo portrays. This is a rare, moving novel as topical as it is bizarre. Don't miss it.	2001-01-31

Rotating Tokyo memory hotels, deluges of frozen time capsules, apocalypse, blackened satellite dishes, erotic terrorism...

How did they get here? What is going on? Harpman denies us answers. Even after the women manage a fluke escape, their freedom is ambiguous at best, and we can only watch as they wander an uncompromising landscape (that may or may not be Earth...) and ultimately succumb to exhaustion and death. <br />That this is not a cheerful novel goes without saying. Its triumph is Harpman's unerring eye for the absurd and tragic. Above all, this is an engagingly strange book that refuses to pigeonhole itself into any specific sub-genre. I highly recommend this odd and uncategorical tale.	2001-01-31

Womack's vision is fresh, thoughtful and touched by an studious eye for the bizarre. The plot, in essence, is pretty straight-forward: members of a scheming, dystopian near-future travel back in time to kidnap Elvis Presley, who has achieved posthumous god-status. The protagonists try to present the future-shocked King to the people of the future to satiate their escalating craving for a messiah. But what does Elvis think of his role in this scheme? And is time-travel really as easy as a century's worth of science fiction would have us think? Womack's answers to these questions make &quot;Elvissey&quot; the delight it is. William Gibson has called this novel &quot;a jarringly potent kick in the head.&quot; What else is there to say?	2001-01-31

Womack's skewed look at our past is as frightening as any imagined future. &quot;Terraplane&quot; is a haunted examination of what it is to be human, laced with wit and sad romance. Definitely a trip worth taking.	2001-01-31

But it's surprisingly cogent, fast reading that raises important questions without insulting the reader's intelligence.  Brennan's thesis isn't developed into a working hypothesis; he leaves this thorny task for others to unravel.

Thankfully, this isn't an anarchist's rant;  Gatto's thesis is limned with constructive alternatives and an optimism I  found nothing less than stunning.

But he goes much  deeper, challenging mainstream science on epistemilogical grounds and  taking officialdom to task for knowingly (?) circulating bogus claims about  the Face and other anomalous formations on Mars.  &quot;The McDaniel  Report&quot; reveals a NASA saturated in its own self-importance, and deals  a weighty blow to prevailing SETI dogma.  <br />Carl Sagan has said that  &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&quot;  Well,  here it is.

I  find the author's speculations fascinating; even without them, though, the  Martian enigmas present their own formidable challenge.

This book is really  without peer.  Jinks skillfully addresses the controversy surrounding  apparent artificial structures on the Moon and Mars, breaking developments  in &quot;cold fusion&quot; research, the UFO phenomenon and  higher-dimensional topology--and he does so never asking for blind belief  and never going beyond the available data.<br />Don't misunderstand: &quot;The  Monkey and the Tetrahedron&quot; is a decidedly speculative book.  But  Jinks, unlike many authors who attempt rational narratives on similar  subject matter, keeps his discussion refreshingly free from intellectual  dishonesty.  As such, it has the potential of gaining a readership even  among our self-proclaimed skeptical elite (though, in all seriousness, I  don't see CSICOP offering Jinks any endorsements).<br />Ambitious and  well-wrought, Jinks' book, a kind of &quot;unified theory of the  strange,&quot; inspires and is occasionally transformative.  Just when I  thought I was familiar with just about every perspective on fringe and  paranormal phenomena, &quot;The Monkey and the Tetrahedron&quot; arrives,  bristling with intelligence, honesty and--above all--wonderful new ideas  we'll have to wrestle with in on way or another as we step forward into the  21st century.
