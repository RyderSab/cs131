Yet, it seems to me that Piper has done a wonderful job with this book. I can testify that this book has given me an increased interest in the spiritual discipline of fasting.<br /><br />Piper does a wonderful job of communicating basic truths about fasting and also instilling in readers a hunger for God. This book is very emotional, and yet also provides a very solid Biblical basis for what it communicates. Of particular significance is the fact that the book doesn't present fasting not as a way to sway God, or as a mere Old Covenant ceremony, or as an \\"ordinace\\" to be routinely followed, but rather as a heartfelt expression of our hunger for God. He presents it as a hunger which we are willing to pursue to such a degree that we occasionally will set aside the things that \\"fill\\" us, whether they be food or some other gift from God. The book also separates Christian fasting from mere ascetism and also handles a number of the common objections to the practice of fasting.<br /><br />Also, in the Appendix there is an index of quotes on fasting from Christain leaders ranging form Ignatius to modern day people. What a nice touch!<br /><br />I suppose that this book will be the standard by which I evaluate other books on fasting that I may read in the future.	2005-08-14

It yas been a while since I've finished reading it, so pardon the lack of details. When I picked up this book, I was eager to start. But once I did, I found to be rather sub-par.<br /><br />The idea behind this book is great, but the book's composition could use some rethinking.  I don't feel that the book does a good job of teaching the subject matter. At least 3-4 chapters needlessly drag on and seem to be the rough equivalent of a burdensome rant. That is not the best way to instill a passion for the subject in those who are looking on.<br /><br />In retrospect, I'm left with very little tangible benefit from reading this book and the only things I took away from it are the author's drawn-out argumentations regarding I Cor 3 and James 5 in addition to their tedious argumentation that we should only see a single level of meaning in prophesy, and all scripture.<br /><br />I walked away from reading this book with the impression that the authors failed in fulfilling the goal implied in the subtitle: Teaching the Reader \\"A Commonsense Approach to Understanding and Applying the Bible\\". I have no doubt that Ron Julian, J.A. Crabtree, and David Crabtree are brilliant, helpful, and interesting individuals, but I think you should look elsewhere if you are trying to find a book that will give you a commonsense approach to Bible interpretation.	2005-08-07

I'm not necessarily a fan of Che's ideology, but this book is good and worth a read whether or not you adhere to marxism!<br /><br />The book is not very ideological (since it was before he became a revolutionary), and is basically just a compelling narrative of the fun, struggles, and learning that Che and a friend experience as travelling across Latin America. What it does do, though, is provide some framework for understanding what happened later on in Guevara's life, he definately saw a lot of life changing things throughout his trip.<br /><br />I was able to relate to their experiences and I found it hard to put the book down.

Though its perspective is somewhat alien to me (it is written from an Episcopalian perspective), this book is well-written and the author does a fine job of unwinding history from his perspective.<br /><br />Personally, I find that Dawley doesn't really do justice to covering the Puritans nor the Anabaptists in a fair way. Of course, he is not coming from those perspectives, so naturally his coverage of them will be limited. And he only seems to focus on the more fringe elements of Anabaptism.<br /><br />I must say I strongly disagree with some things the author says. That is not too say that I don't think the author tries to be balanced and fair.<br /><br />This is a fine work of scholarship and I recommend it as an outstanding Episcopalian view of church history. There are better books on church history in general, but this book will give you a well-presented Episcopalian vantage point.	2005-05-31

Richard presents the issues surrounding Galatians 3:28 in a very systematic, careful, and fair way.<br /><br />His conclusions are essentially \\"complimentarian\\", and he makes no apologies for his position. He carefully weighs the options and doesn't use flippant rhetoric to arrive at his conclusions.<br /><br />Richard did not write this book to push forward a favourite \\"hobby horse\\", but he puts forth carefully balanced exegetical book.<br /><br />This book is fantastic in its attention to detail and precision.  You get the feeling that Richard is very comfortable with Biblical exegesis. Though decidedly complimentarian (which is my position too), he is very even handed and actually chides both sides for not being clear enough in their communication and lacking charity. He also credits those who disagree with him when credit is due.<br /><br />I would recommend this short but scholarly book to anyone who is interested in this issue, regardless of which position you take. It will make you think more carefully about how you use Galatians 3:28.	2005-05-24

This is truly a great work on Spurgeon.<br /><br />It is by no means trying to give a complete look at his life, but rather is focused at highlighting a few key controversies and aspects of his life that are often obscured in modern analysis of Spurgeon. That is the stated goal of the book, and it suceeds at this.<br /><br />Even though it is limited in scope, as I have mentioned, it still does a pretty good job at painting a picture of Spurgeon as a whole.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in  learning more about the man named Charles Haddon Spurgeon. It is fairly short and is an enjoyable read with many quotes from Spurgeon's sermons.	2005-04-29

If you can get beyond some of the surface-level disagreements you might have with Mr. Pollan, you will find his work insightful and that you agree with him more than you disagree with him.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read. I liked the \\"theory\\" part of the book better than the \\"pratical\\" part. I wish he had made the \\"theory\\" part a bit longer.<br /><br />I don't agree with everything that the author says, but I can't discount the value of the book. It is worth a read and will give you some real good advice without sentimental fluff.<br /><br />Of course, this book is a career-oriented book, so if you are looking how to \\"live rich\\" religiously, philosophically, metaphysically, or whatever, look elsewhere. Most criticisms of Mr. Pollan's viewpoint on money is because the people criticizing his work are coming from a metaphysical or spiritual angle, while this book merely instructs on how to live richly in sense of a career. And he does that make it clear throughout the book (in telling people to use their career to get money and their other aspects of life to get other things).<br /><br />I guess someone may accuse Mr. Pollan of advocating overly strict  compartmentalisation of life. I can understand that point of view. Even if you are against Mr. Pollan's ideas in this sense, I suggest you still read this book. It will challenge you and is especially good for entreprenuers, who often get too involved in making their business big and \\"successful\\" without remembering about the bottom line--for them. This book is worthwhile on that account alone!	2005-01-26

I had high expectations, and the book certainly didn't live up to me.<br /><br />When I think of a good 'debate book', I think of interaction. Interaction is very vital to allow readers to properly compare two opposing sides and sift through their positions.<br /><br />This book failed in the area of interaction. To me, it almost seems like laziness. They just grabbed exerpts from pre-published  articles, and merely pasted them together. Consequently, some of the \\"opposing\\" view points didn't evenly match each other or even address the same areas. There is nothing necessarily wrong with publishing a book out of pre-published matter--if it is done right. In this case, I don't think it was done right.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book could have been much better if they had rather contacted the authors of these articles. They could give authors a small statement to respond to, and right an original essay. That way they couldhave had the authors addressing similar points. It would really make this more of an enjoyable read. Of course that would take effort and money, but that's what you need to compile a good book, right?<br /><br />This book manifests all the downsides of the approach they took; it seems canned, artificial, the various essays don't seem to address the opposing articles points head-on, and it has a very patchy and scrappy feel to it. I found the book disjointed and often felt like a person on a boat being tossed around in the sea.<br /><br />If you are interested in technology, you will find some interesting content here, but then again I don't think its worth a buy because of the lack of effort in making their content original. Do yourself a favour and get another book.	2005-01-16

The authors thread together many different events and stories to create a compelling work and they seem to do it with a high level of professionalism and fairness.<br /><br />At times, I found it to be a little overwhelming. New individuals are introduced quickly and sometimes it is hard to keep up with the flow as the authors quickly switch between narratives. But even with that fault, I give it 5 stars because it is a surpurb book.<br /><br />This book avoids abstractions and and avoids the temptation to over-focus on broad ideologies, and therefore is able to deliver a potent survey of what exactly was going on amoung Cubans when the revolution was fomenting and occuring. It is detail oriented, and hones down right to each important player in the revolution.	2005-01-04

I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure that it was going to be very good. I sure hoped this book on communication would not be a waste of time.<br /><br />As I proceeded, my fears eased. The book is well written and flows with a light and anecdotal style. It isn't heavy, but the advice it gives is weighty. It does have some what of a bias towards face to face communication in regard to business, but the authors have kept it general enough to appeal to someone who isn't primarily seeking out the business-oriented of better communication. By keeping each section short and snappy, the authors have enabled the reader to avoid becoming intellectually bored.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some areas of the book, while remaining brief, the authors may have erred in giving a little too much information in the form of bulleted lists and what not, so as to make digestion and retention of some of the information unlikely.<br /><br />With the one caveat in mind, I can highly recommend this book to anyone who interacts with people on a day-to-day basis and feels they could learn a thing or two about communicating more effectively. You will certainly learn more than a few things by reading this book.	2005-01-02

However, don't expect there to be much back-and-forth interaction.<br />Overall, James White does a fine job of defending Calvinism, but what in the world is up with David Hunt? It is obvious that this is not an evenly matched debate and was merely regurgitating the same argumentation over and over again. It also becomes obvious that David Hunt uses careless &quot;cut and paste&quot; methodology not only with Scripture but also when he reads Reformed authors.<br />David pulls no stops at belittling people, using ad hominem and ad hoc argumentation, faulty/non-linear reasoning, and performing eisegesis, etc.<br />Whether the reader is an Arminian or a Calvinist, they will probably come out disgusted at the tatics of Dave Hunt.

I think I learned a lot and I don't regret reading it--it is a classic.<br />I found Augustine's account of his childhood, his exposure to the Manichees, and his search for truth to be really interesting.<br />However, toward the end of my reading I found things to get a bit tedious. I found his discussions on the human memory and his overwhelmingly long discourse on Genesis 1:1 to be tedious and somewhat awkward. I also find his allegorical interpretation of the creation to be somewhat far fetched.	2004-03-15

It basically narrates the cases that were just briefly mentioned the original stories.<br />Don't expect this to match the original Holmes canon. I feel that the first few stories didn't arrest my interest enough, but it got better as I read on. Some of the stories were a bit too predictable. I give this book a good rating primarily based on the last two stories--they are WONDERFUL and very creative  (The Deptford Horror and The Red Widow). The other stories ranged from \\"alright\\" to \\"pretty good\\".<br />If you are new to Sherlock Holmes, get the real canonical stories  from Arthur Doyle instead. If you are a seasoned Holmes fan, get this book to make your collection complete. I don't regret having bought it.	2004-03-14

I will give him that. Anyone who writes an 800+ page book should be congradulated for their efforts.<br />That being said, this book is greatly lacking. Firstly, the print quality of this book is not the greatest. The text is ridden with too much bold text, changes in font, and italics. The ink, in certain places, is also fading on the copy that I have.<br />The content of the book is quite whimsical. Even the advocate of Conditional Eternal Security should be ashamed of its whimsical approach. It is heavily rhetorical, plays on emotion, and in all the steam it puts forth amounts to very little in terms of solid, indepth exegesis.<br />It is hardly &quot;exhaustive&quot; as many claim, though it will &quot;exhaust&quot; your eyes due to all the bold typeface utilized.	2003-12-24

US	38619816	R93NA04N5TFPY	0310234395	506236318	Four Views on Eternal Security	Books	2	30	44	N	N	Not What I expected	I bought this book with pretty high expectations, but it didn't satisfy my high expectations.<br />Firstly, as one other reviewer mentioned, the book spends very little time in exegesis of the key texts. Too much time is spent bickering back and forth about predestination and free will. Sure those two topics are foundational and need to be addressed, but I didn't like the way they distracted from the main topic. In an attempt to avoid &quot;proof texting&quot;, I think the theologians forgot to go into in-depth exegesis. It seems to me that the authors were also slow to challenge errant interpretations of certain texts. Could this be because of length constraits? Perhaps. For example, take Revelation 22:19. Ashby uses the rendering chosen by the Textus Receptus, but nobody actually challenges him on that. One would think that the textual issues of Revelation 22:19 would be brought up, but they were not.<br />Thirdly, I think the &quot;Moderate Calvinist&quot; position is misapplied. Norman Geisler is an Arminian that believes in Eternal Security, not a Moderate Calvinist.<br />Fourthly, I don't mean to be rude, but Norman Geisler (or 'Giesler' as they call him on page 158) was really making things laughable. He goes along and tries to make a claim to being a Moderate Calvinist, when he really isn't one. Also, he makes some wacky statements, like &quot;Even a casual reading of Arminius reveals the extent to which he was Calvinistic&quot;. This is just laughable! Arminius a Calvinist? OK, Mr. Geisler, we have just lost all hope in your ability to even understand this issue.  And it doesn't stop there. Page 270 has another extremely wishy-washy statement by Mr. Geisler. He says &quot;predestination is not conditional... The only conditional is our receiving it&quot;. Mr. Geisler, what will it be? Is it conditional or unconditional, it can't be both! Another classic statement by Geisler is &quot;God's love is irresistible on the willing&quot;. The whole idea of the word 'irresistible' implies that it doesn't matter whether one is willing. That statement is plain double-speak. Is it irresistable or not? Again, you can't have both. Giesler is a respectable theologian, I appreciate his contributions to apologetics, but he doesn't seem to have a handle on this topic and can't seem to even use within their normative usages.<br />Fifthly, although Michael Horton had one of the more refined approaches in this book, I think he made a mistake in making his arguments too tightly dependent on the children of the covenant and his particular conception the covenants.<br />I think, independantly of what I believe (based on basic evaluation techniques), that Stephen Ashby's presentation was the most refined with Michael Horton coming in a close second.<br />I found Harper to be the least refined, with Geisler second worst. Harper probably did the least scriptural exegesis and spent most of his time exegeting Wesley instead. He was civil in the debate, but very unconvincing.<br />I acknowledge that this book may be the best book on the topic due to a lack of titles in this area. There aren't many good &quot;point of view&quot; books on this topic. Therefore, I will give this book 2 stars, while I feel it deserves only 1. I really wish the publisher was more careful with this book and put the effort to refine it. The book was interesting to me, but it wasn't very potent nor exegetically enlightening.'irresistible' implies that it doesn't matter whether one is willing. That statement is plain double-speak.

Its interesting to see all those people who marked this book with 1 star. I wonder if they even read the book?<br />For example, in the review entitled &quot;thou shalt not commit false witness&quot;, a reviewer claimed the McCarthy hates catholics. Little does that reviewer know that McCarthy expresses his love for catholics right in the pages of the book, as he came from a Catholic background.<br />The book is interesting and well-written, even if you don't agree with the conclusions. I would surmise that even one who does not agree with the books conclusions would have to give it a minimum of 2 or 3 stars for a good effort.<br />The book is an interesting read, and very factual and well-substantiated. It doesn't resort to bitter polemic, but rather presents a strong case for the Protestant view of Catholic tradition.<br />The book does a fine job of objectively presenting Catholic dogma, as put forth in various official sources. After the presentation of the dogma, McCarthy goes into a Biblical critique of it.	2003-10-14
