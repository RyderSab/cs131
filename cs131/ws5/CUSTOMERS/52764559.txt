It was a new spin on writing. But as his style \\"matured,\\" the writing went downhill.  He made himself a minor character in the series. Then a not-so minor character. Then a major player. What an ego!  Along the way the writing became cookie-cutter, and the imagination and uniqueness that made the books stand out slowly disappeared.  The plots became totally predictable - no surprises anywhere. We knew how the book would end somewhere near the middle.  I could not even complete this book. I swore to myself that his previous novel was the last I would read. I should have stuck with that promise to myself and saved the money.  Good-bye Pitt and Cussler. You had a good run. Hang it up.	2005-05-17

It was one of the most engrossing, well written books RAH penned. It proved that his &quot;black belt&quot; in writing was well deserved. Any SF fan would enjoy this book, period. I know a LOT of people that love SF and some that tolerate it. All really - really- liked this book.<br />Come on, RAH even did some time hopping in another novel to revisit the events of this one - and &quot;save&quot; a key character. As the old cereal commercial states &quot;try it - you'll like it!&quot;	2003-11-04
US	52764559	R7XZYQV2XQSCF	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	5	6	6	N	N	One of the best military SF novels ever	First, forget the movie. It's loosely based on the book.  How loose? Man fights killer bugs in space. The political scene on Earth, and the *basic* character outlines. That's it.  No huge bugs that spit glowing balls of killer goo from their nether-regions. No flying Kamikaze insectoids that decapitate without warning.  The movie was fun, but a dim shadow of the book. The movie should have been called &quot;fashion models in space vs the killer bugs from the belt.&quot;<br />RAH was a master at socio-political setups and the details that make great SF. I find it a little insulting that the publisher slapped a scene from the movie on the cover just to grab more sales - the book can stand on it's own merits!  If you are a fan of SF, RAH or future-looking novels of society and war, get this book. It's one of his best!	2003-11-04

Remembering the last Destroyers Mike Newton wrote, I was expecting the absolute worst.  To be fair, many of the reviews here are unduly harsh.  At least Mike Newton went to the effort of making this newer book fit in the Destroyer timeline.  Approaching this book was like a trip to the dentist.  Like expecting a root canal, but had a cavity filled instead.  Sure, it was still painful, but not nearly as bad as I expected.<br />Destroyer purists can nit-pick the book to death.  Heck, they/we can find fault with pretty much any Destroyer book.  Any casual fan of the series won't have a problem with this book.  Even the devoted fans will have to admit that book did not &quot;screw up&quot; the timeline like Mike Newton's earlier books.  This book does not rank in the top 10 Destroyers, but neither does it rank in the bottom 10.<br />As I mentioned, I started out with the worst possible expectations, and came away mildly surprised.  The plot was decent, although the author failed to nail down Chiun and Remo, and did make some pretty glaring mistakes.  Smitty and the sidekick had really, really, small parts to play, and Remo's natural attraction to the chicks was totally absent. Chiun was vulgar, and Remo needed a watch.<br />We also did NOT need a half chapter narrative on the history of Smith and CURE!  So I'd rate this book as below average, but not the total disaster I expected	2003-08-25

My first introduction to Verne's work, was sadly, the b-rate movies on late night TV.  Mysterious Island. Giant critters harassing hapless castaways.  Forget any visions you have from the movie.  This book was inspired on the real life adventures of a castaway.  That was also the inspiration for Castaway, Robinson Crusoe, and even Lost in Space and Gilligan's Island.<br />Basically take the Professor from Gilligan's island and multiply the skill a hundred fold.  Unlike the campy TV series, these creations are realistic.  We don't meet Nemo until the last few chapters. Until then he's an unknown benefactor coming through in the castaways' times of need.  It's a big book with small print, so get ready for a long - but worthy - read.	2003-03-08

If you're a long time of the Destroyer series, you'll truly enjoy this book.  Chiun is back to leaving bodies for Remo to clean up.  Remo continues to flex his authority as reigning master, albeit with the MOS Emeritus watching his every move.  There are plenty of Remo and Chiun *moments*, lots of action, and a new Russian temptress. If you're a new reader, you'll like the plot, action, and humor.  Either way, BUY the book.  Plus I'm in the dedication, so it just has to be good!<br />Sad to say Jim is leaving the series.  Damn.	2003-01-30

It has EVERYTHING that has made the series so great over the decades.  Jim is really wrapping things up before he leaves the series.  Remo has ascended to #1 honcho of the house.  Chiun has a new lease on life thanks to the Great Wang (sounds like soft core porn!)  Shiva and Remo come to terms (pretty much.)<br />There's even more.  The Dutchman.  A mad russian monk.

After reading this latest installment in the Destroyer series it really hits home that Jim Mullaney is leaving the series.  This is his most enjoyable book to date.  It takes place before and during Remo's &quot;recruitment&quot; into CURE.  It ties in Nuihc, the Dutchman, the original #1, The Day Remo Died, the Shiva connection and lots more.  He has way too much time on his hands - it looks like he re-read most of the books in order to keep the timeline straight.<br />The early interaction between Remo and Chiun is classic.

Balam takes Kane on a dream trip throughout his previous lives, from Egyptian slave, to King Arthur's right-hand-man.

Kane must stop him, as he has throughout all of time.<br />If we ignore the Holy Grail aspect of the book, the rest was a fun read.

I've been waiting for the next release in this series for 5 years - and it's not a disappointment.  Took a while to get into the plot again - but that's what the intro was for.  We meet a new sapient species that has also been 'a bug squashin' for a long time, learn much about the bugs, their methods and hardware.<br />Plenty of military jargon (as you'd expect!) and tons of action.  If you're a fan of the series, get it. If you've never read the series, you'd probably want to skip it. You really need to have the history of the series to appreciate and enjoy this book.  As military SF, it's very good - although not as good as Drake's \\"With the Lightenings\\" or Weber's own \\"Honor Harrington\\" series.  It's space opera  - many of the really great characters in the series get killed off in these books, the baddies are really, really, evil, and many events are predictable.	2002-02-19

We also hearken back to the earlier days of the series, when the females in peril had 38dd's and were in constant danger of crying themselves to death. Chiun begins to show his age, and Remo is actually starting to act his - a little.  The Dutchman is ready for his encore, Chiun is ready to retire - suffice to say that a LOT is going on.

Ah memories.<br />If you can find the series, you'll enjoy it.  From the immortal who winds up as a live disection subject (hey, he keeps healing...) to the gods playing dice with the lives of the characters.

Mr. Gordons is back. The Dutchman is almost back. Remo is officially Reigning Master.  Elize Roote (#118's foe) is back - and it's the first face off of two of Sinanju's greatest adversaries - Roote vs Mr. Gordons . Jim has packed so much into this book it's almost dizzying.  O.J gets whacked. Stephen King gets lampooned. Back in #18 when we first met Mr. Gordons , Chiun plays with a model airplane, then kills someone with it. In #125, its a model rocket ship. In #18, Remo tries to fry Mr. Gordons with a rocket engine.  In #125 it's a Space Shuttle engine. Smith's apprentice (Mark Howard) is coming into his own, just as Chiun's apprentice (the white thing) has ascended to Reigning Master. Mr. Gordons survives once again.	2001-11-30

Chiun simply calls him a prince (after all, He's Emperor Smith's #2).<br />There's some more Sinanju history, another prophecy, Remo battling an internal crisis.  Many hints about the future of the series, Chiun, Remo and Smith. Looks like big changes are on the way!<br />It was a REALLY good read.

I've been reading Cussler since Raise The Titanic.  He's gone from fresh and original, to tarnished and long winded. When Cussler copied Hitchcock's walk-ons with little cameos of himself as a character in the books it was cute. The first time. The second time it was lane. Now it's just annoying, especially since it's no longer a cameo, but a minor character.  If you read the book, you know the ending. WHY the briefcase? What was the point? It was really lame. Cussler is aging Dirk Pitt, and that's fine.  But after he reminisced about his long lost, drowned in the underwater lab, girlfriend, you saw the final few pages coming a mile away.  Predictable. Will I keep reading Cussler? Sure - even his bad books are better than many writer's good efforts.	2001-10-25

This book takes those axioms and destroys them.<br /><br />It, in one page, ignores and obliterates some of the key beliefs and history of the previous 109 books.<br /><br />We need Warren Murphy back at the helm.  The plot was sketchy, the characters shallow, and our hero, Remo, is now a cross between James Bond, Charlie Chan, and IBM's Big Blue.	1998-04-09

It has nothing to do with the series, but the hero has many of the characteristics of Remo in the Sinanju saga.  Chess playing Yin vs Russian spy Yang.  Mystery, twisted plots, and more.  Great read.	1998-04-01
