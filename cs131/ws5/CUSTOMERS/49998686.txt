I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave  the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God. I think maybe one of the mother superiors in her book had it nailed when she said that karen had a problem with intellectual pride.	2002-04-05

Let me assure you that although Pastor Buck Roland's account is incredible, there are also many, many incredible miracles in the Bible as well. Pastor Roland comes through as sincere, down to earth and just as honest and credible as I've heard he was. And YES, this book is indeed scripturally sound and compatible. I've also read the report that the other reviewer posted about by Walter Martin, And if there was ever an account of straining a gnat and swallowing a camel, THAT was it. His theology is shoddy to say the least and he reads like he needs to be in the first chapter of one his \\"cult books\\". (if he indeed did author one) Christianity is about faith, and this book is guaranteed to increase yours. Do yourself a big favor and read this book. You'll be very, very glad you did.

The natural catastrophes she gives are so lengthy it's hard for her not to miss but still she did.

I don't know what &quot;god&quot; the author encountered but it was  certainly not the God of the bible. This man's theology is far- reaching to  say the least. He frequently quotes eastern teachings (the Bhagavad-gita  alot) and supports the false teaching of reincarnation. He says that this  god he talked to never mentioned Jesus and that a Hare Krishna he had met  in the past had more favor with God than Christians. (Jesus said NO man can  come to the father but by me) He plucked many scriptures out of the bible  to try to &quot;support&quot; his claims but failed terribly as they are  totally out of context. He also quotes just as many teachings from other  religions as he does the bible. As far as the other two reviewers all I can  say is they obviouly aren't bible believing Christians and haven't read  alot of books in their life because even I wasn't reading this from a  Christian stand point this book was dry and lifeless.	2000-08-22
