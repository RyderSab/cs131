If this was really one of King's works, it is one of the best I have read in many a year.  I saw the tv movie, Rose Red, first and wondered about the history of this nice little movie.  Then I saw the book on The Best Seller List for several weeks and thought it must be something I had to read.  Took me another several weeks to get it from my LIbrary and I loved it.  I wish it was real.  KIng was getting really far out for my taste and this appealed to me.  Keep it up, Mr. KIng.  Not all your stuff is that good but do another one of this or similar to The Shining.  Anne	2002-07-24

I have debated over whether to bring this to anyone's attention, especially the Author's who has actually emailed me, wonder of wonders' but I cannot not bring this fact to her attention and I know she will look at this.  Medicare is not based on one's assets.  You receive Medicare once you are 65 or after you have been disabled for at least two years.  Maybe our wonderful author was thinking about Medicaid which is based on one's assets.  Likewise, ONe can get Social Security benefits at age 62 or at any age age when one becomes disabled as Gus, obviously was, with the severest arthritis  there is.  I intend to read all 36 of this author's wonderful books so I hope she won't be mad at me for this entry.	2002-06-26

It is hard to believe that Denny was so turned off by her loving Mother for no reason that I could figure.  Maybe life in 1977 was badder than in 2002.  The scene where Isabel goes to the house, hoping to find her daughter, is horrendous.  The last page or so was weak when Mother and daughter come together.

She adjusts to life with Henr;y, yet finds her patience tested by visits from Henry's sisters, domineering, unstable Agatha and timid Millie, still suffering from a romantic but tragic past.  When Henry dies under mysterious circumstances, Sarah is wrongly imprisoned for his murder.  After her release, she turns to Henry's son, William, to help her undover the truth.  However, as Sarah and William's love deepens they remain unaware that a secret haunts the Cobb family - a secret that threatens to destroy the life they share.&quot;<br />This paragraph is quoted directly from this wonderful books cover as I could not have summarized it better.  It is hard to understand why somebody somewhere has not seen fit to review this novel which is every bit as good as any of Ruth Rendell's.  I have just discovered Rae and will plow on until I have read them all. I am thankful that she has written quite a few.  The reader knows thae secret in this family from the beginning, but of course, Sarah and William don't know it until the end, many years later.  What makes the book so interesting is that the currents and subcurrents are so interesting and you wonder all the way who did what and why.  The end is both a surprise and not really a surprise.

This was written in 1978, which may be among her very early works and I believe it is my very favorite. It is the stormridden saga of an unusual family, it is really the story of the baby, Glenn, the little sister who spends her life looking for true love. Her parents, Lisette and Ray, are a poet and a tv producer or star. They figure early on and produce these 3 very talented children but bow out rather quickly. All the characters in this book deserve their own book. The oldest daughter, Gaby, isn't very likeable but produces a wonderful son who goes on to do great things. Remember this was written in 1978 and Ms. Vale Allen had some good foresight in what Corey undertakes. Then there is Dana, the writer, very successful and worth knowing. He has some special problems which are fixed in the end. I guess they could be termed &quot;fixed&quot;.. But, you can't help loving and identifying with Glenn, a gifted artist and a writer, who finds love after all even though things seem rough in the interim. I suspect Ms. Vale Allen is an artist in her own right as I have just finished Painted LIves in which art figures prominently. I wish I could write like this.	2001-09-07

The Editorial review can't even get the thing correct.  Sigrid had nothing to do with the special therapy dolls, that was the crazy psychologist whose name I have already forgotten.  A Greenwich Village dancer  was brutally killed in front of a roomful of people and it took Sigrid some few hundred pages to figure out who was the killer, even though it had to have been one of about 6 of her coworkers.  Combined with this murder is the unsolved murder of a little girl, killed some months before, apparently by someone in this same theatre group.  Don't read it unless you have to.	2001-07-23

This one wanders and meanders around with the different characters being focused.  Mother moves out abruptly, leaving the teen Lucille to cope with her dismayed father who has lost his license to drive due to excessive speed.  Lucille must assume the role of female caretaker.  Then her sister, Rae, arrives home with a husband and very pregnant.  This compounds the situation.  Father takes up with another woman, midway.  Mother calls home frequently to chat but nothing is accomplished.  Lucille has a somewhat boyfriend but eventually falls for Rae's husband and this makes things somewhat more interesting.  The delivery of Rae's baby makes for an exciting scene, but overall the book just puddles along until it ends.  Not one of HUmphries's best.	2001-07-22

He encounters all kinds of strange people in his travels who are described in great detail in this book but add nothing to the overall plot.  He loves Margaret, a black singer in Atlanta, encounters her female lover Peg with whom he has a sexual encounter.  Overriding everything is the strange story of Enoch, his something grandfather who murdered 7 men who had raped his wife and her sister.

Some of the scenes and action here were somewhat far fetched but I can overlook that and concentrate on the characters who made the book live.  I hope the most negative reviewer has now read more of Mr. Kay.  She should try Taking Lottie Home.  I hope Kay is not through with his stories.  After Eli is soo good, too.	2001-05-22

It is story of Nell and her half sister, Camille, who is 9 years older and more like a Mother as their Mother died shortly after Nell's birth. Nell is in school in England in the early 1860's and Camille is in Charleston, SC where she is engaged to Martin, who is in the Army.  Camille is summoned to England after Nell mysteriously falls out a window of the boarding school, survives, but is quite severly injured.  Lady Kersey, a distant relative, has recently died, leaving the old house of Wychwood to them if they can live there a year and find the treasure.  If they do, it is theirs forever.  They travel to the small village, isolated in the English Countryside where they begin meeting suspicious, witchy people.  Everybody seems to be against them and Camille is suspected as a witch since strange things begin happening.  There is  a handsome male neighbor who is suspected to be wanting to find the treasure and inherit the house.  Her lawyer is suspect but one would never believe what happens to him.  Lady Margaret, her children, Amy and Phyllip play a nice role in the tale and The Copper Maid, an old tale, begins to roam again.  Sheep are mysteriously poisoned with suspicion pointing to Camille.  She doesn't know who she can trust.  Tied in with their story is the story of Katherine Parr, Thomas Seymore, Henry V111, and Queen Elizabeth The First.  The ending is a thriller as the culprit is the least likely suspect.  Worth a good gothic read.  This was my first book by this author.	2001-04-28

It is an eerie and romantic story of an island stuck in time and a young girl who has leukemia and not expected to live very long.  Her Uncle and loved Aunt have bought the Island and plan to turn it into a tourist resort after the family spend a month there in a sort of family house party.  There is much wonderful fresh air, good home cooking and everything one would want on an ocean isle.  A couple, the Leamings, have lived in a little shack on the island for the last 50 years, but no one has seen them as they are very shy and withdrawn.  I loved the dark puzzle of the island and its inhabitants and the ending was very surprizing.	2001-04-14

This is a dark, brooding, Gothic novel, unlike any gothics I have ever read.  Victoria Holt's stuff looks like kindergarten, compared to this.  Verity Austen has come to Hoby Hall on the bleak seacoast of England in 1889 from South Africa where she was born and raised.  She was there with her Mother years ago and has vague memories of that visit which permeate the whole book in such a way that the reader is not sure what is true and what isn't.  Her uncle, Frederick Mott, has died just before she arrives and his weird son has succeded him as the Rector.  Phillip is a secretive man who remembers something about  Verity's childhood visit which she does not.  Add Aunt Charlotte, the old housekeeper, and Harriett Tabb (why is she there) and we have a strange, bitter mixture of murder and insanity which the reader cannot truly figure out until almost the last page.  If Virginia Gay is still alive and writing, Please let me hear from you.  I loved this book.  Her discriptions of the environment are great, my only problem was a sentence on Page 52:  &quot;The fog lay like a pale glistening curtain between the sea and I.&quot;  This is a person with a graduate degree in American history from JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY......	2000-12-04

She opts, after much thought, to terminate the pregnancy, only to find herself arrested a month later and charged under a new law that retroactively makes abortion a capital offense.  The book's cover says this could really happen which is impossible to believe but certainly may be possible.  The outcome of the story is a surprize, but nothing like what I expected.  The DA was a dummy, but her defense team, naturally, brilliant.  The Judge should have been presiding over the OJ trial.  Read it, it's very good.	2000-11-15

I was very pleased and surprised with the story and content and some of the history of the Mormons which I really know very little about.  I guess I can go into some detail since no one else has reviewed it.  Lilly B. comes to America from Scotland, loses her Mom on the way, becomes involved with a Mormon family and with a good looking young man, Chase Mitchell.  they have SEX and he goes to Mexico to fight, leaving her very pregnant.  (Horrors)  She marries a Mormon man but cannot get very into their sex life.

US	52053946	R2ZRJL3QOUSFYH	0385312431	337756350	The Good Mother	Books	4	19	36	N	N	thought provoking	Having worked for Social Services in North Carolina for 42 years, I have seen it all. I cannot believe a Mother would accept her boyfriend letting her 4 year old touch his genitalia, much less let him &quot;stay in  her&quot; after the child got into bed with them.  I think Anna got what  she deserved, although I felt sorry for her and especially for Leo.  Sue,  It was almost a true story for me!	1999-12-14

If GAS is a carbon copy of NS,  I dread the mushy love scenes and the adultery among the &quot;best people  in the community&quot;	1999-09-30
