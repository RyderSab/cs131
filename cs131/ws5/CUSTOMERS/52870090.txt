For years, psychologists have endeavored to offer advice and assistance to those coping with personal and professional issues. For obvious reasons, many counselors, consultants, and trainers have focused on managing stress at work. Employers want smooth operations without the potential serious consequences of stress-induced problems. Careers have been destroyed by inabilities to deal with the ongoing changes in business.  <br /> <br />I opened this book with an expectation that I might find some new secrets...perhaps a whole new approach to how workers-individually and collectively-could function much differently. What I found was another book on stress. Others may see some new ideas, but I've read a lot in this field so my expectations are probably higher than the average reader.  <br /> <br />The text is organized to explain resilience-essentially having the inner strength to cope because you're doing a good job at managing change. The authors describe this as developing hardiness, the foundation of their Hardiness Institute. The book reports on a 12-year longitudinal study of employees at Illinois Bell Telephone. The stress of all the change over the years caused the departure or failure of two-thirds of the workers. The survivors practiced effective stress management techniques. The keys they promote include approaching change as a challenge, developing sound problem-solving strategies, resolving conflicts, and building commitment.  <br /> <br />Readers will find an abundance of case studies that make points for the authors, teaching techniques and offering examples to stimulate thought.  <br />	2005-10-12

Read this book and apply what you learn. Each chapter can make you money. That's a pretty bold assertion, but you're going to learn a considerable amount from this book...even if you think you already know everything about building contacts and business on-line. I gave up on the idea of turning corners down and started taking notes! <br /> <br />There is an incredible amount of information in these pages. Some you may look at as ho-hum or I-knew-that-already, but there won't be much. Maybe the net etiquette section. The content is cutting edge. I know, because our firm has a relationship with a company responsible for some of the technology they cite, and their launch was in March 2005.  The notes in the back of the book are, by themselves, practically worth the price of the book. I would have liked the index to be a bit more comprehensive, but that's a minor point given everything else that's in this volume.  <br /> <br />The authors repeat a theme throughout the book: the Seven Keys to a Powerful Network. The concept was presented nicely and interpreted well. Then, later in the book, we got more chapters on the theme again. In hindsight (book reviewers can do this), I would have liked to see the explanatory chapters pushed further to the front of the book. Of course, if the book designers had done that, I would not have been so excited about the terrific content I was getting before I was a third of the way through.  <br /> <br />Whether you're looking for a spouse, a business partner, a venture capitalist, an employee, or new customers, this book will show you the techniques that work in today's electronic virtual world. It's a whole new ball game folks, on a new playing field with new rules. Teten and Allen are your coaches and, with this resource, you can be on a winning team. <br /> <br />Buy and use this book before your competitors do. <br />	2005-10-08

Combine that phrase with the subtitle about contrarian ways to improve leadership effectiveness and you begin to gain an idea of what this book is like. Frankly, I wasn't sure if I'd get a laugh a page or serious stuff. Turns out I got both! <br /> <br />Rinke, an experienced executive leader, management consultant, professional speaker, and author presents alternatives to the old saws that populate so many leadership books. Listen to some of the chapter headings: Knowledge is Not Power. Don't Manage People. Don't Be Proud. Don't Have People Work for You. Don't Focus on the Bottom Line. Don't Satisfy Customers. Are you getting the idea that you might be in for an interesting ride? <br /> <br />Each chapter lightly pokes fun at the common belief, though not as obviously as I expected it would. Readers will be surprised at the strong treatment of leadership skills, illustrated with stories that bring them to life. The lessons are presented in a way that holds interest and teaches practicality. <br /> <br />Laugh? This book includes something unique; I have not seen this done before. In each chapter, just before the summary, there is a brief section titled \\"Smile.\\" Rinke shares a bit of humor with the reader to keep the book light and to demonstrate that leadership should be fun, not laborious.  <br /> <br />If you've spent any time in leadership positions, you'll identify with the proverbial advice...and can probably create your own thinking about what Rinke teaches us. You'll spin a paragraph or two before you wonder where to go next. Rinke will be there to take you further down the path to success. <br />	2005-10-04

In this thought-provoking book, Gordon lays out the critical situation employers will face-do face-in finding and holding employees who have the education and training to get the job done. <br /> <br />I'm very familiar with the severe shortage of skilled labor, as lead author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People.\\" Ours was the trail-blazing book that exposed the shortage. Gordon has taken our theme to the next level. This book is a tightly-written work that will, hopefully, stimulate productive discussion in board rooms, meeting rooms, bed rooms, and school rooms across the country. It is the kind that should be seriously discussed by corporate executives, educators, community leaders, and parents. Discussion should be followed by decisive action. The time for idle chatter has passed. <br /> <br />The book is organized into three sections. The first part presents our current situation in terms that will grab your attention. Part Two takes you deeper and will build a strong motivation to do something. In Part Three, Structuring Renewal, your mind will move toward the solutions to this vital problem. Extensive notes and a comprehensive index will support your investigation of this issue.  <br /> <br />I titled my review, \\"Open this book.\\" You can open this book to practically any page and be instantly drawn into to story. Before I read the volume cover-to-cover, I flipped through the pages to just take a sneak peek at what was there. Reading just a paragraph or looking at organization wasn't enough. I wanted more. I was pulled in to keep reading. Gordon brings this issue to life.  <br /> <br />Recommended for business leaders, educators, human resource professionals, politicians, and enlightened citizens who are dedicated to making a difference for the generations that will follow us. <br />	2005-10-04

Meet Joe Calloway, a consultant on branding and competitive positioning. He's delightfully candid, direct, instructive, and stimulating. As you read this book, you will get to know Calloway as a human and consumer with feelings...that certainly come out in this text. I thoroughly enjoyed page after page of stories of how companies become indispensable...or not. The conversational tone is captivating and motivating. <br /> <br />You'll read about the Five Drivers: create and drive momentum, develop habitual dependability, continuous connection, big picture outcome, and engage, enchant, and enthrall. The chapters illuminate these drivers and deliver even more. I found myself looking at my business relationships much differently-both as a consumer and as a deliverer of goods and services. Between Calloway's lessons, countless examples, and case studies is an intricate fabric of a clear message. Be indispensable or lose to the competition. I won't tell you more details-there's too much to try to convey the depth of this book in a review. Read it. <br /> <br />Expect to be thoroughly engaged by this book, eager to return to it every time you put it down.

In addition, many of us are \\"carriers,\\" dumping that guilt on others so that everyone around us shares our psychological problems. The authors of this book think that's silly. <br /> <br />Mothers and fathers, usually with an emphasis on mothers (fathers have other problems) harbor deep-seated guilt that is really not necessary or appropriate. The authors explain this in page after fascinating page. In many cases, illustrating their points, they compare the non-guilt behavior with the guilt-laden response to situations. What a learning experience this book can be for all of us! I've already given it to my wife as a significant gift. I hope it will help! <br /> <br />After reading Mommy Guilt, I told my wife about the authors' Seven Principles of the Mommy Guilt-Free Philosophy: You must be willing to let some things go. Parenting is not a competitive sport. Look forward to the future and at the big picture. Don't become overly hung up on the here and now. Learn when and how to live in the moment. Get used to saying yet more often and being able to defend your no. Laugh a lot, especially with your children. Make sure you set aside specific time to have fun as a family. And, dear readers, that's only on page 17! Each of the principles is explained, with lots of examples that enable the pages to leap to life. <br /> <br />As you might expect with this kind of a book, there's a survey in the appendix so you can test your own guilt ratio. Lots of explanation to help you understand the meanings and cures for your problems. And, a helpful tool all by itself, there's an Emergency Guilt-Relief Guide in the back of the book, right before the index.  <br /> <br />This one's a keeper! But...when you give it to someone as a gift-because you know they need it, do so with love instead of with \\"I told you so\\" as the underlying attitude. Guilt istricky, and you'll learn a lot in these pages. <br /> <br />PS--Valuable skills for the workplace, as well as family.	2005-09-03

Wherever they were, people who could scurried home to be with family. The question of the day was whether the attacks were over. A whole new sense of vulnerability spread across the land like a flu virus.  <br /> <br />Corporate executives caught the bug-fear flu. Is it over? Will it happen again? How vulnerable are we-as a nation, but also as our company? As paranoia set in, business leaders slowed plans for research and development, the building of new facilities, and the growth and development of their employees. It became more difficult to plan for the future, not knowing how the market-and each company's marketplace-would respond.  <br /> <br />Trying to run a business-any kind of business-under the threat of terrorism was a whole new experience for the domestic operations of global American companies. With the threat hanging over their heads, at least psychologically, corporate leaders struggled to cope. Ignorance was rampant; most executives had never operated under crisis or potential crisis...and this field of leadership is certainly not taught in our business schools. Confusion reigned and many organizations became less productive, more cautious, and less profitable.  <br /> <br />Dan Carrison observed this shift in American leadership. As a consultant, speaker, and former journalist, he realized that he was equipped-through background and skill-to create a guide to help leaders understand their new environment and how to excel under these new circumstances. So, he went to Israel to get answers. The story is more complicated than that, but you'll read about the process of Carrison's collection of information and advice. <br /> <br />Carrison interviewed executives in a number of fields-face-to-face-in Israel. He learned first-hand how they function in a world that is much different than what we have known in the United States. Numerous interviews are reported, with commentary. A summary list of lessons learned adds value at the end of each chapter.  <br /> <br />Prepare to learn about creativity in a new way. Resilience, defiance, and resolute leadership make things work-\\"Goliath in assets, David in attitude.\\" Carrison points out several times that just about everyone in Israel knows a victim of terrorism. This volume takes the concept of contingency management to a whole new level. <br />	2005-08-21

It's not intimidating, like some management and leadership books can be. The writing is a mix of storytelling and advice, flowing from the attitudes, behavior, and effectiveness of Fred the Postman. Fred is just an ordinary postal carrier who performs in an extraordinary way.  <br /> <br />Author Mark Sanborn, a well-respected motivational speaker, explores what Fred does, why he does it, and the impact that effort has on others. Throughout the book, Sanborn offers examples of people in all walks of life-regular people like you and me, showing how they go over and beyond the ordinary to make a difference in the lives of those around them. The lessons are both instructive and inspirational. The themes are so well interwoven that you hardly realize that you're being taught or inspired; it just sort of happens.  <br /> <br />Much of the advice offered consists of the same material that we've heard from motivational speakers for decades. The phrases and morals will sound familiar as you move comfortably through the pages. The personal one-on-one sharing style that the author uses to convey his messages somehow makes the messages much easier to \\"get,\\" absorb, and use.  <br /> <br />The Fred Factor is great for individual reading and personal growth. It will also be valuable for years as a training tool. Employers no doubt will buy this book in large quantities to inoffensively encourage their employees to be Freds in their work, to reach out to others, to build relationships, to do the extra things, to make a difference. This book would make a great gift for young people about to go out and make their way in the world. When they commit to Fred behavior, they will open their lives to that much higher level of satisfaction that comes from serving others. <br />	2005-08-14

I was delighted with the book and gave it a glowing review. In my opinion, the author had done a superlative job. Read my review and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />With that experience, I looked forward to another book by Teal with eager anticipation. When I saw the similar cover and the branding on the cover, I assumed that this book would be a continuation of the Bath Pond story. Nope, not related at all. And I read all the way through Fortunes Crossing looking for the connection. Nothing there. Apparently the author and/or publisher are attempting some sort of branding, but branding needs more than just the same author to be effective. If there is supposed to be some sort of moral message coming through, it's not clear enough nor explained in an afterthought. Missed opportunity? <br /> <br />I found some of the dialog in this book to be a bit more stiff and contrived than the fine work I experienced in Bath Pond. The story was interesting, but seemed to drag a bit in places. References to places where characters lived was fuzzy early in the book, then presented specifically at the end of the volume. Even when presented, the locations and the story line didn't seem to quite make sense. Such continuity issues took away from the high enjoyment I had anticipated. <br /> <br />A page at the end of the book announces that Fortunes Crossing is the second in the Bath Pond series, and that the third book is planned for release in late 2005 or early 2006. Well, that dates this book, doesn't it? I'm surprised the publisher bound that time-sensitive notice into the book instead of inserting a flyer in some percentage of the first print run. And, I hope that Teal writes a little more at the beginning or end explaining the principles and connection with Bath Pond. A mere mention is not enough; assume we readers are ignorant of your purpose and give us a thorough explanation and linkage. <br /> <br />Values messages are appropriate in a series of books, but the continuity and relationship of the books in the series must be apparent or the impact is lost. <br />	2005-08-06

Loaded with Lessons	When you look at the title of this book-and the cover with its picture of clouds, you may suspect that this is one of those far-out religious books. No, it isn't. It is spiritual, but not by the text. The message may have religious overtones-if you're religious. The powerful value of this unassuming little book is in the heart and mind of the reader. <br /> <br />This volume is a collection of short stories from the author and a number of other people, talking about their fathers, their experiences, and the impact their fathers had on their lives. You may come close to tears a few times as you feel what the authors are writing about. If your reading experience is anything like mine was, you'll gain a fresh, new understanding of your father's influence on who you are today. <br /> <br />The stories are organized by category in the book: Attitude, Integrity, Memories, Determination, Compassion, Wisdom, Inspiration, Character, Nature, and Courage. Investing a few minutes with this book will pay dividends for years to come. My wife noticed a significant change in my demeanor right away. <br /> <br />If your father has passed, refresh the memories with this book as the key. If your father is still alive, expect to gain insights that will draw you closer to the special man in your life. Recommended for people who have lost their father, as well as for today's father who wants to know how Dad managed to do such a fine job of raising you. Today's fathers will learn lessons from this book that will empower you to be the kind of father your children want you to be. <br />	2005-08-01

That assumption would be unfounded when you consider the work of Kenichi Ohmae. This prolific professor-in the broad sense of the word-still has a lot of ideas and opinions to share...and a worthwhile portion of it is in this book. Although he weaves in some work from previous writing, all the pieces in The Next Global Stage fit nicely together. <br /> <br />Looking at the title of this book, I thought about the expression that \\"All the world's a stage....\\" And, sure enough, that's the way Ohmae approaches his perspective of what's coming next. He presents his thoughts in theatrical terms, beginning with the plot to open our thinking. Part one is The Stage. The curtain rises with a world tour as our eyes are opened to some of what is happening in various parts of the world. For those who have focused so intently on China and India, insight into Ireland and Finland will be a new direction in thinking. A range of other low-on-the-radar countries are also addressed in the book by the extremely well-traveled author. The global economy is defined as we learn more about Ohmae's view of the end of economics. Beyond nation-states, it is now more appropriate to think of regions, he argues.  <br /> <br />Stage Directions (Part 2) takes us on a journey to understand the playmakers and views of global regionalism and their roles in future development. Government and politics are discussed in the third section of the book and readers gain insights into future markets and a wide range of countries where things are happening...probably beyond the knowledge of the average reader. There is much to be learned from reading this book.  <br /> <br />As we look at the world of today and consider where we may be going, The Next Global Stage will help us to appreciate what's next. Thoughtful reading, easy to follow and absorb. Good index supports research and re-reading. Global strategists seeking food for thought will find what they need in these pages. <br />	2005-07-31

I don't read much outside that genre, because I haven't really found that many books that really seem worth my time. A friend suggested I read Bath Pond, and I felt uncomfortable right away. \\"Bath Pond,\\" what kind of title is that? What am I getting into? But, friendship being what it is, I agreed.  <br /> <br />Almost from the beginning, I was pulled into this book. The writing style is easy to flow with--almost too contrived in the dialog in a few places. But, captivating! I'll admit to actually giving up some work time to return to the pages of this historical novel. When tears begin to well up just from reading words on a page, something's happening. This writer has a way of engaging the reader that makes this book worthy of my highest recommendation. <br /> <br />The storyline is the tale of a family growing up in Florida in the Depression and the decades that followed. From literally having nothing but each other, a young couple build an inspiring life in the cattle, farming, and citrus business that characterizes Florida's history. Joy and tragedy take the reader on a roller-coaster ride of real-life experiences that are vividly portrayed. I found myself emotionally involved a number of times, even when trying to be dispassionate about my reading. Teal obviously used his background--growing up in the environment he writes about--to good measure. <br /> <br />A book I tried to avoid became a favorite. For some great appreciation of a slice of history rarely seen, a very human story of people so real you can almost talk with them, and an opportunity to reflect on your own life, read Bath Pond. <br />	2005-07-27

As I shake my head in wonder, I contemplate whether any of these people ever read a book on what speech-making is all about. <br /> <br />If they were to search for such a book, The How of Wow would certainly meet their needs. The author has written speeches, delivered speeches, critiqued speeches, and enjoyed the journey of coaching executives how to present their ideas-and their ideals-in public.  <br /> <br />This book is not quite what you might expect it to be. It is not a rah-rah volume, nor it is a step-by-step handbook for writing and delivering a speech. Rather, Carlson's book is a lighthearted look at one of the biggest fears harbored by men and women in today's business world.  <br /> <br />In an unusual approach for a book on this topic, Carlson begins by asking why the reader should even care about giving a blow `em away speech. Then, part two challenges whether you should even accept the invitation. Not all opportunities are right, so be careful. In the third section of the book, Carlson digs into how to think about what you will say...and why. Preparation gives you strength, as in part four you settle into the writing phase. Craft the story, make the connection, Carlson advises repeatedly. Then, to demonstrate, he does exactly that in these pages. You'll learn more about hooks to connect with your audience than you ever thought existed. <br /> <br />The writing section explores ways to build simplicity-much more effective in speechmaking than complexity. You'll learn about language, quotations, and words and phrases that detract from, rather than contribute to, the positive influence of the speech.  <br /> <br />The last section of the book takes us into the actual presentation, with a follow-up emphasis on going beyond merely the basic strength of the speech itself. The supplemental questions at the end of the chapters is exceeded only by appendices that take you deeper into the knowledge base of speech-writing.  <br /> <br />Well-directed toward executives; value for professional speakers, as well. <br />	2005-07-23

A number of sub-categories of the profession have been developed by specialists who began their own educational programs, bodies of knowledge, and certifications. Marcia Bench is one of those specialists, concentrating on the vital field of career coaching. <br /> <br />In addition to her personal coaching of hundreds of clients, Bench formed the Career Coach Institute, a virtual training organization pioneering this part of the coaching field. The Institute was founded in 2001; this book was published in 2003 to share Bench's perspectives, positioning, and body of knowledge.  <br /> <br />The first part of the book is devoted to a thorough explanation of coaching and, more specifically, career coaching. While the focus is on individual professionals coaching individual private clients, the concept has broader application in working with students, recent graduates, and corporate employees.  <br /> <br />Bench and her followers emphasize what they call \\"authentic vocations.\\" Their design includes eight factors: life purpose; values; motivators and interests; knowledge, skills, and abilities; work and other expertise; job/career targets; work environment; and business reality.

The author's contention is that we are in an era of customer power. Customers have numerous choices of where they shop-and where they buy-for practically all their goods and services. This highly desirable situation, from the position of the buyer, can be challenging for the seller. No longer can companies take customers-or customer loyalty-for granted. A new design is called for. <br /> <br />The new theory, postulated by Glen Urban, a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management, is customer advocacy. He calls his approach \\"Theory A-for advocacy. The concept is disarmingly simple, but is explained in over 200 pages. Put simply, relationships are not enough by themselves. You must build sufficient trust with your customer that you can legitimately advocate for your customer-taking the customer's best interest position in providing the right merchandise and service at all times.  <br /> <br />To achieve this position, truly working on behalf of the trusting customer, takes a culture change in most organizations. Leadership development is key to success of Theory A, as is cross-cultural cooperation. In his book, Urban shows the reader how to accomplish these changes in an organization to become customer advocates. <br />	2005-07-15

Of course, it is! You would not believe how many different ways you are affected every day-directly and indirectly-by what is happening in this huge country on the other side of the globe. Shenkar, an international scholar focused on China and East Asia is a perfect guide to take you on a journey of discovery. You'll be fascinated. <br /> <br />The book begins with a look at past centuries, to better understand this one. The first couple of chapters provide an enlightening understanding of the what and the why that will equip you to amaze friends with your lucid conversation about China. Historically, China has important relationships with Japan (a former conqueror), and the dragons. You'll learn about that aspect of China before you dive into an exploration of technological development.  <br /> <br />Shenkar does a great job of covering the waterfront. As I pondered specific pieces of the China puzzle, our author provided the answers. Relationships with American companies, job migration, and possible scenarios for the future. I can not testify that this is a complete book-I'm sure there are a number of subjects that Shenkar didn't cover. However, what he does cover in this book will give you an invaluable understanding of China: its people, its potential, its problems, and its power. With an emphasis on economic issues, there is considerable food for thought. <br /> <br />What you learn in the pages of this book will alter your view of the world and stimulate your thinking about your future. Regardless of your position in life or where you live on the planet, your future will be influenced by what is happening in China today.

No, it's not. TurboCoach is more focused on the reader as an individual than it is on the techniques of professionally coaching others. This volume is more of a self-help book.  <br /> <br />TurboCoach, a guide to better managing your own life, is organized into 21 short chapters grouped together into three sections. The first seven chapters are designed to help the reader gain clarity about one's own life. The text seems most appropriate to the sole proprietor and independent business owner than to an employee of a larger organization.  <br /> <br />The second section of the book, another seven chapters, explores improving one's personal productivity. The third section-yes, another seven chapters-deals with growing your business. The authors' Advanced Coaching and Mentoring Program is promoted after the body of the book-big surprise. The index is helpfully comprehensive. <br /> <br />I felt the book was somewhat condescending. It appears to have been written by formula; may I suggest \\"manufactured?\\" Each chapter begins with two questions, with check-off boxes, and a synopsis of the chapter's focus. A few pages of text come next, followed by a seven-question application exercise. Who ever decided that life should be packaged in sevens? Almost every chapter has the same structure. After a while, the reading became annoying. The obvious structure distracted from the content.  <br /> <br />There is good material in the chapters and the writing style makes the advice easy to grasp. For the beginner in this field of reading and personal growth, there is good value here. The advanced reader may find this read too simplistic.  <br />	2005-06-30

Interest in the development of technology to improve our lives is intense, and in demand. \\"If we can send a man to the moon, why can't we......? <br /> <br />In Geeks, John Edwards, a veteran business technology journalist, takes us on a fascinating ride through a rich resource of developments. While these inventions, creations, products, and emerging technologies are initially designed to enhance military effectiveness, a large proportion have civilian applications that can significantly improve our quality of life.  <br /> <br />Readers will enjoy an eye-opening tour through seven (chapters) technological arenas. After a relatively slow start through the introduction-interesting, but not exciting, we begin with a look at tactical systems. Finding things and breaking them is the way the author describes this aspect of war-an apt description. With our imaginations tickled by the creativity and possibilities of these almost-science fiction advances, we continue our journey with a look at how information is gathered and applied. More and more of the civilian applications leap from the pages. We begin to wonder how many of these hi-tech (OK, geeky) ideas are actually reality already, and how many are still in the design phase. <br /> <br />The book explores developments in telecommunications (like ad hoc wireless networks), reconnaissance (a robot that can fly), disaster relief (mass casualty treatment), and easily transferable health, medicine, and biotechnology advances (QuikClot to stop serous bleeding). Logistics, security, and clothing are covered in the final three chapters. As you near the end of the book, your eyes-and mind-may glaze over in amazement and intellectual overload. The intriguing research into intelligence and high-tech clothing will hold your attention. <br /> <br />A valuable glossary follows the text, a welcome tool. The book is well-indexed, a helpful feature when you want to find something to discuss with someone else. And you probably will! The surprisingly enjoyable book-I didn't expect such an imaginative work that was highly readable at the same time-will be of interest to young and old, military and not. Innovators in all fields will find the text stimulating. You won't find political statements or innuendos, just straight reporting.  <br />	2005-06-30

OK, some of them are put together by ghost writers, but the message is still credible and worth listening to. Stallkamp is a former president of Chrysler Corporation and former Vice Chairman of DaimlerChrysler. It's worth paying attention to this one. <br /> <br />The premise presented by Stallkamp is simple: you attract more bees with honey than vinegar. It's a message we learned from our mothers as we were growing up. Now it's presented to us in a business context, with examples that bring the proverb to life. Stallkamp tells the story of how he developed a process at Chrysler that generated a strong sense of collaboration with suppliers, a partnership to continuously improve wherever possible.   <br /> <br />While this collaborative approach sounds like a no-brainer, many companies don't operate this way. Stallkamp tells the story of his counterpart at General Motors when he was head of procurement, who applied a very strong conflict model to manage supplier relationships. The adversarial commerce model didn't work, and Stallkamp's posture in this book is that it won't work-ever.  <br /> <br />Readers will learn about Stallkamp's model at Chrysler: SCORE. This name is an acronym for Supplier Cost and Reduction Effort. The experience demonstrated that cooperation produces substantially more long-term savings, as well as short-term gains. The collaborative relationship can be sustained; the adversarial cannot.  <br /> <br />You'll gain helpful insights into the collaborative process, read about examples in a number of industries, and be inspired to build positive relationships in your work. The relationship message is recurrent in business today, so this book reinforces prevalent thinking in the leadership field.  <br /> <br />Valuable read for senior leaders and company owners, as well as procurement specialists. The book includes messages that senior leaders need to convey throughout their organizations. <br />	2005-06-27

Changing Resistance into Understanding	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Disarmingly simple, surprisingly effective	Here's another one of those books with few words, large type, lots of illustrations, and a whole lot of white space. For those who read \\"serious\\" books with full page after full page of text, this may look like a throw-away. They said the same thing about \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" and....best seller! <br /> <br />My forecast is that many people will buy this book like an expensive greeting card to send a message to people who don't get it. Even at a price of twenty bucks (remember inexpensive books?), this book will be purchased in bulk and distributed to all those employees who need to make some ever so subtle shifts in their behavior...if they want to survive in the corporate jungle. <br /> <br />The story, as easy to read as a fairy tale, begins with the main character being irritated because other people don't get it. Ever feel that way? Ever NOT feel that way? As the reader is lured through page after page, the tables turn and Main Character has been had by the moral. Sometimes other people don't get it because YOU don't get it! Zap! Right between the eyes when you weren't even looking. The book was well-constructed to set you up and then whack the message right at you.  <br /> <br />After you get it, the authors share some normal text explanations of what it all means. They take the fable into management-speak or consultant-speak-your choice-to give the reader the explanation of what they just got. Again, however, the pages are barely filled with ink, so the book is anything but intimidating.  <br /> <br />Sound bites. Object lessons. Small, non-threatening. Cute title. Recipe for success.  <br /> <br />As a Certified Management Consultant striving to help clients get it, I gained some valuable lessons from this book. I'll think more about the messages of this book next time I interact with people who need to get it. I'd bet you will, too. <br />	2005-06-23

Clich concepts get old, unless someone comes along with a radical change and turns the clich inside out. Enter Rick Barrera, a well-known marketing guru. People like this stretch our thinking, pushing us out of the envelope and tromping on the box in the meantime. If you listen to their messages, you will have difficulty staying \\"inside the box.\\"  <br /> <br />Barrera does not disappoint. Emphasizing \\"touch points,\\" the intimate contact with the customer that can win-or lose-the day, he demonstrates how companies can go beyond the ordinary and fulfill the expectations they create in the mind of the consumer.  <br /> <br />This book is organized into two sections: Overpromise and Underdeliver. The first section engages the reader in a discussion of brand promises, how they drive company growth, and ways that well-framed brand promises differentiate companies in the marketplace. Barrera's educational writing is well-seasoned with recent real-world examples.  <br /> <br />In the opening pages of his book, Barrera introduces the concept of touch points-those special, meaningful moments where the customer comes in contact with the company. Three types of TouchPoints (Barrera's spelling) are presented. \\"Product TouchPoints occur where customers interact with the product or service a company is selling.\\" \\"Human TouchPoints occur when the customer directly interacts with an organization's people.\\" \\"System TouchPoints include all other points of contact between a company and its customers.\\" The author explains each type of interaction and his views about their importance. \\"All three TouchPoints are vital to an organization's success, though to differing degrees. All three require a substantial and continuing investment of funds and managerial energy if they are to do their job properly...\\" The TouchPoint concept reminded me of Jan Carlson's work with Scandanavian Airlines years ago. Good lessons bear repeating.  <br /> <br />The second section concentrates on meeting and exceeding customer expectations with each of the categories of TouchPoints. Two case studies, Washington Mutual Insurance Company and Lexus, illustrate the concepts before a concluding chapter and close into the index at the back of the book. <br /> <br />The book is filled with advice, examples, and inspiration that will be valuable to anyone in marketing today. Beyond this highly appropriate reader group, I would recommend that corporate executives pay careful attention to the book's messages. The concepts will be valuable to recruiters-corporate, college, and military-as well as to educators in all environments. The lessons conveyed in \\"Over Promise and Over Deliver\\" will be valuable to many people for many years. This is a book for our times.	2005-05-09

If you are a manager or supervisor in any kind of company where you are responsible for employees between the ages of 16 and 24, buy, read, absorb, and apply this book. If you are the confused parent of one or more children between the ages of 16 and 24, buy, read, absorb, and apply this book. If you are an educator of students between the ages of 16 and 24, buy, read, absorb, and apply this book. Are we communicating here? <br /> <br />OK, your first reaction is the profanity in the book title. Live with it! You will find the word a few places in the text, but it's there to make a point. Yes, the writing is punchy, direct, and pushes the envelope of your thinking. However, so do the attitudes and behavior of your young people. We older folks (let's say that term refers to all us gray beards over 35) need to wake up and smell the differences between today's young workers and their counterparts in previous generations. They are different, and must be managed differently. Learn how and succeed. Ignore the lessons of this book and continue to pour profits down the drain by recruiting, training, recruiting, training, recruiting, training, ad nauseum.  <br /> <br />Eric Chester is respected as the leading authority on this age group, assuming that anyone can be an expert on kidployees. As a consultant and author in the workforce field, I'm very comfortable telling you that the man is right-on in his writing as he is in his speaking. He'll grab you at the beginning of the book and hold your attention with anecdotes (some from his own life) and lessons learned. In page after page, Chester presents knowledge, insight, techniques, and advice that-if heeded-can substantially strengthen a manager's effectiveness.  <br /> <br />In the first of five well-organized sections of the book, you'll gain valuable perspectives about the 16-24 year olds (Generation Why), noting how and why they're different...and how the difference can be a powerful asset for your company. Subsequent sections address how to attract, keep, and connect with this important employee group. The last section offers important insight into some employers who get it right...why and how. An index supplements the text, enabling you to go back to particular sections for refresher readings. <br /> <br />You will be amazed at how much the author has packed into this comfortably-sized book.  <br />After you're finished with your first reading, you'll probably be inspired to buy copies for other managers in your organization. Wait. I take that back. That inspiration will come to you before you've finished with the book. It hit me somewhere about half through the pages. <br /> <br />Warning: if your competitor uses this book and you do not, you are in big trouble! <br />	2005-05-03

Lots of awards, recognition, books, etc. Well respected. If you're not in marketing, he's still the world's foremost, etc, etc. And from his perspective, we are all in marketing. So, this book is for everyone in business...and then some. <br /> <br />You'll find this little paperback disarmingly short...in appearance. First impression is that the book is too short to have much to offer. Surprise! There's an amazing amount of knowledge and insight in these pages. The format makes the book easy to read-in one sitting or in chunks or even sporadically as a reference book.  <br /> <br />The format is somewhat unusual, which gives a sense of special-ness to the book. Think of a question you'd like to ask a man like this, if you could have him all to yourself for a few minutes. OK, good. Now, ask another one. And another one. That's what your experience will be with this book. Question after question-that people have asked the guru over the years, followed by his short answer. Not long treatises, just short answers like you might get in an elevator encounter.  <br /> <br />The questions are organized into major categories and subcategories. The major sections are Markets and Marketing, Marketing Strategy, Marketing Tools, Market Planning, Marketing Organization, Marketing Areas of Application, and Marketing Excellence. The table of contents consists of the questions and the page numbers. Just let your finger move down the page and you'll find questions that draw you in because you're curious about his answer.  <br /> <br />Bonus: this book has a comprehensive index that makes it easy to find the answers-and the questions-you're looking for. Hence the value as a reference book. <br /> <br />Drawbacks include the plight that the answers will often be shorter and shallower than readers will want. So, read his other books for the depth. There issome redundancy, as might be expected as the topics intertwine. All in all, this is a valuable book, perhaps worth multiples of the price to have a resource for quick, concise, sometimes provocative answers.  <br />	2005-04-26

Sales managers-actual and aspiring-will find a tremendous amount of information in these pages. And the pages are easy to read. This book is definitely a useful tool.  <br /> <br />The volume is organized into three sections: Planning, Preparing, and Producing. Topics include a current perspective on the changing world of sales management, setting goals and objectives, communicating expectations to your sales team, and using performance standards in hiring. And this is only the first section! <br /> <br />You'll learn about recruiting and hiring, use of technology, compensation, and danger signs to watch for. Measuring and managing performance, coaching and counseling, and a focus on the future are all discussed in a realistic, comprehensive design that is easy to read, absorb, and apply. Strange as it sounds for a book like this, you may find it difficult to put down. Yes, it's that engaging. I found myself turning page after page before I realized how many pages I'd read! <br /> <br />And the text is supplemented by two appendices: a leadership growth plan and a checklist for success. <br /> <br />There are a lot of books out there on this topic, but this one is worth the investment of your time. Advice: read more than one if you're entering this field. No one has all the answers! This is a great foundation book, covering a lot of topics without going too deep. <br />	2005-04-25

His books (plural) bring helpful information to focus for leaders of all kinds of organizations.  <br /> <br />My first impression of this book is that it is designed well. The text begins with a positioning of Strategy in the leader's tool kit, then dives right into a listing and explanation of Cohen's ten essential principles of strategic leadership.  <br /> <br />The first is a no-brainer-or should be: Commit Fully to a Definite Objective. Remember the old adage: \\"If you don't know where you're going, any path will take you there.\\" Your focus must be clear...and shared with team members. Next, Seize the Initiative and Keep It. Economize to Mass Your Resources. The list continues, with a solid chapter on each theme. The presentations are illuminated by examples and stories that help the reader understand how the principles have been applied over history. This approach builds interest and variety for the reader, enhancing the value of the book. <br /> <br />The third section of the book addresses action steps to put the principles to work. Readers will learn how to link their plan to their environment, what to do when things go wrong (you know they will-Murphy is still with us!), and how to apply the universal principles.  <br /> <br />This handbook is good reading, and will also be a valuable tool for leaders of any kind of organization. <br />	2005-04-24

There is a lot involved in the process. It starts with the development of the job description and continues through the job offer being made and accepted or declined. The process is explained in a flow chart in this book, accompanied by text that details each step. <br /> <br />The hiring process need to be managed. That management task is accomplished through the use of a series of forms to be completed by participants in the process. With all laws governing employment, using the right forms (avoiding the wrong forms!) is essential.  <br /> <br />The forms you need are all included in this book. They're ready for you to photocopy and put them to use. While the author recommends you clear use of the forms with your company's legal counsel, just to be extra safe and secure, the originals are all ready to copy from the CD -ROM that accompanies the book. <br /> <br />Fyock, a nationally-respected authority on hiring, has developed a very valuable tool in the Hiring Source Book. She starts by examining the hiring process (chapter 1). This information is helpful for the experienced human resources professional, as well as for management people (read: small companies without an HR department) who engage in hiring new employees. Her next chapter addresses the actual design of employment applications and how these tools fit into the process. The next chapters on interviewing and evaluating applications provide a broad range of advice and instruction that will build the confidence of even the most experienced hiring authority.  <br /> <br />Hiring involves more than just looking at applications that may come in. Chapter 8 is filled with techniques that will strengthen the process...and your results. Stay out of trouble by following the legal rules around hiring. They're explained in a way we can actually understand! And, since the composition of our workforce is changing in the United States, the chapter on hiring Hispanic employees makes this book particularly timely. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended. If you hire well, employee retention becomes a lot easier! As author of \\"Keeping Good People,\\" I've seen that many retention problems arise just because the hiring wasn't done correctly. Read and use this book and save yourself a lot of grief...and money. <br />	2005-04-24

We've gone from Deming and Crosby's Total Quality Management to Six Sigma. What next? <br /> <br />Reliability. <br /> <br />Keki Bhote was one of the creators of Motorola's original Six Sigma system and Adi Bhote, a long-time Motorola employee, is a Six Sigma champion black belt. They know where quality has been, where it is, and where it's going next. Their emphasis is now on reliability. What is Reliability? It \\"is the key to uncovering and stamping out product failures before they happen in the field.\\"  <br /> <br />To achieve higher reliability, the authors recommend an approach they call MEOST: Multiple Environment Overstress Testing. It's a non-mathematical model that uncovers the weak points so they can be corrected before a product goes to market. The low-cost process is said to reduce field failure rates by one or even two orders of magnitude. A huge promise is made in the preface: \\"This book can show companies, mired in miniscule and fading profits, how to really make money.\\" <br /> <br />And this is an underlying focus of the book, beginning with the topic of Part I: The Challenge for Industry: Regaining Lost Profits. Next, the authors present what companies should not do, then they move into their MEOST presentation. An appendix, notes, and index supplement the text, adding value. <br /> <br />If you're in the quality field or have this kind of work woven into your job description, you owe it to yourself and your employer to read this book. <br />	2005-04-24

With years of post-secondary education under his belt, he's one of those rare people who has seen it all, \\"been there, done that,\\" and \\"when I was your age.\\" Dr. Zeiss is president of Central Piedmont Community College-with 70,000 students, the largest college in North Carolina. His credentials are impressive, as is his reputation for leadership in the field of workforce preparedness.  <br /> <br />This book is disarmingly short. It looks and feels like a quick read, which will attract more of the busy executives who need to get this message. As author of thicker books in the field, I commend Dr. Zeiss for a concise work that wastes no time in conveying the most urgent message of our day. <br /> <br />The subtitle of the book tells the story: \\"How to Attract, Develop, and Retain Peak Performers in the Coming Labor Shortage.\\" Our dilemma is an insufficient supply of workers who are educated and trained do perform the work that needs to be done. Zeiss begins with a recognition of the emerging shortage of skilled workers in the United States (a dangerous problem uncovered in our book, \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People.\\") Digging deeper into the issue, he reports that \\"at most community colleges, nearly 70 percent of recent high school graduates require remedial math or English before they can take college-level courses.\\" A majority of high school students are programmed to go to college, but \\"only about 50 percent of all university freshmen graduate with a degree.\\" And a chilling fact: \\"According to the Associated Press, of 1,000 who applied for manufacturing jobs at Siemens, only 35 had the skills to be hired.\\" <br /> <br />With this context, it's easy to appreciate the value and timeliness of this book. Zeiss gets right into his content in his first chapter, going deeper into the trends and the challenges facing employers. He taps his own background and experience, and the work being done at his college, to illustrate his points. Subsequent chapters concentrate on attracting, developing, and retaining peak performers.  <br /> <br />This book is a great how-to guide, presenting accepted knowledge in the field in a focused, credible manner. Zeiss' perspectives add extra power to the message, and his credentials suggest that CEOs will be more accepting of the information coming from him. The pages are filled with thought-provoking ideas that will stimulate readers to mark pages, highlight, take notes, and move to action. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />	2005-04-22

Norgaard, born and raised in Denmark, presents six of the tales. Each is presented in summary form, then in full context. Next comes commentary about what Andersen was saying, including nuances that come from the Danish text and not from the English translation. In each chapter, the moral of the tale is explained. Some business context is provided, but not enough that it was clear that this is a management book. <br /> <br />I found this book to be an interesting read. Taking children's fairy tales and finding lessons for business in the 21st century is an interesting concept. It's fascinating how the moral teachings of long ago apply in today's context. While the messages are related to business, this is more a book of wisdom than technique. You'll find the content to be thought-provoking and filled with relevant teachings. If you want a hard, practical book, look elsewhere.  <br />	2005-04-18

In some cases, the designee is an experienced project manager. In most cases, however, the assignment is given to someone who has little or no knowledge or experience in project management. Consequently, too many new project managers stumble, flounder, look foolish, and don't achieve desired project results.  <br /> <br />Give that neophyte some help! A partner to accompany the project manager step-by-step with guidance, advice, forms to use, and answers to the questions that are sure to bedevil you if you didn't have an expert by your side.

His focus is to work specifically with people who do not manage projects as the principal element of their job, but who want-and need-to learn the techniques to do a great job.  <br /> <br />Your learning will begin with a short introduction about how to use the handbook. This section will build your comfort and help you see the all-important big picture. Part One explores deliverables, project phases, and life cycles. After a brief time in Part Two, looking at project management processes, you'll dig right into a treasure trove of action items that take you right through the steps.

This is one of those books.  <br /> <br />The book's subtitle is \\"How Companies Profit by Giving Workers What They Want.\\" For savvy leaders, this is a no-brainer. However, as a Certified Management Consultant with 25 years of practice under my belt, I can tell you that an uncomfortably large proportion of managers don't get it. And those who may suspect that they can do more to build their productive relationships with employees often question whether these ideas are just a lot of fluff and woo-woo. <br /> <br />This book presents 30 years of research with the results of surveys given to over 4 million employees. This is a huge contribution to the field, particularly when the book contains a significant amount of material in the appendix about research methodology.  <br /> <br />The real meat of the book will be found in the sections on how enthusiastic workers are motivated by fair treatment (job security, compensation, respect), achievement (purpose and principles, job enablement, job challenge, feedback/recognition/reward), and camaraderie (teamwork). Even as you cruise through the table of contents, your mind will shout \\"duh!\\" But as you read the pages, you'll find a meld of academia and real-world that presents a serious handbook into how to gain greater commitment and results. This is a deep business book, not conversational light reading.  <br /> <br />The final section of the text explores organizational culture and what the authors-consultants and professors-call the partnership organization. Naturally, consultants-internal and external-will gain quite a bit from this book. Corporate leaders-and particularly those charged with organizational change and positive cultural reinforcement-will find the book a treasure. Even a relatively quick read (a scanning for insights and ideas) will stimulate thinking for busy executives.  <br /> <br />This isa book that will be scanned, re-read, and referenced by people dedicated to taking our workplaces back to the foundations that made them strong in days past...when people really cared about their jobs-when they were genuinely enthusiastic employees. <br />	2005-04-01

Some jobs pay a lot more because they are less desirable and less popular among job-seekers. Others will pay much less because they involve easier work, better working conditions, less education and training, and more flexibility. These jobs are often held by women, who could increase their income by moving to the higher paying positions. These opportunities are described in the book. <br /> <br />Based on his premise that if you \\"choose the right field, the higher pay will come,\\" Farrell continues with 25 ways to increase your income. While a lot of this knowledge is not rocket science, I've never seen it presented so succinctly. This book is quite well organized, very easy to navigate and absorb. <br /> <br />The six chapters in Part One, with the 25 reasons, are a fine book without anything else. But, there's more! Part Two delivers eight more chapters on a wide range of factors that differentiate men from women in the marketplace. Farrell slices through the myths to provide new perspectives...including a chapter on jobs where women are paid more than men for the same work. Facts and feelings are intertwined to create a fascinating read that is hard to put down. A lot of questions in this field are addressed head-on, like \\"Isn't the issue more than comparable pay; isn't it comparable worth?\\"  <br /> <br />This book will be popular, and frequently cited. Now that I've read it to create this review, I'm sending this book to my daughter who is about to receive her masters degree. As a proud father, I've told her for years that she deserves more. Now I can give her a book that documents that position. <br />	2005-03-08

First, it's small enough not to be intimidating to the reader-very important for salespeople with precious little time on their hands. Second, the print is large enough to make it highly readable and comfortable for busy people to move through efficiently. Third, the tone is conversational. You feel like you're having a chat with the author.  <br /> <br />So, sit down and have that nice chat with an author who is a high level sales professional and trainer...who is not yet 40. Mark Leader is a high achiever...the kind of person who exudes all those things that people on the way up want to absorb. This book is his expression of what he wants to share, so absorb away! <br /> <br />The book presents 10 distinguishing marks, as the author calls them, that build sales success. The chapters are organized into three sections: How Leading Salespeople Think, What Leading Salespeople Know, and What Leading Salespeople Do. You'll learn about everything from positive thinking to understanding people, building a great home life, time and service management, and focusing on purpose. This text is up close and personal. You'll get to know this achiever and understand what makes him tick.  <br /> <br />I predict you'll read this book more than once. It will be just that much fun. You won't get it all the first time because you'll be moving too smoothly and too quickly. It's worth the repeat...and another for reminder's sake.  <br /> <br />Recommended for beginning salespeople, polished professionals, and everyone in between. <br />	2005-02-22

Finding ways to work collaboratively with others is the key to success. <br /> <br />The SmartMatch process is a Cycle of Success with eight steps. Each of the main chapters of the book deals with Think Big, Prepare to Play, Position your PINS (an acronym for Profession, Industry, Niches, and Specialty), Zoom in on High-Potential Partners, Analyze and Evaluate, Explore and Establish Your SmartMatch Alliances, Maximize Your SmartMatch Alliance, and Enjoy and Expand.  <br /> <br />The text, explaining basically a simple process, is supplemented with charts, sidebar boxes, anecdotes, and checklists. This is an easy-to-understand book, not complicated. For the beginner, it's a fine primer. For anyone who has been in business for a while, the ground-floor nature of this book will be frustrating. The content is not the deep sort of thing that an experienced businessperson may seek, though there might be some good reminders buried for you in the fundamentals. <br /> <br />Good book for the right market. I found it to be simplistic, but people new to alliance building could find it very helpful. <br />	2005-02-22

A Fun, Upbeat and Fresh Approach to Negotiating	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Light Reading with Good Messages	Hal Becker is a sales trainer and professional speaker. His friend, Jon Lief, is a gemstone broker. What can these men teach us about negotiating? They're not negotiators. They're not trainers in the field of negotiating. They're not university professors specializing in negotiating. And they're certainly not statesmen with decades of experience across the table with heads of state. <br /> <br />That's the point. They're ordinary guys who gained their expertise in negotiating in the trenches. This is a practical book written by two businessmen-very successful businessmen-who learned about getting what they want by actually doing it in a variety of situations. Becker was Xerox's Number One salesman; you don't achieve that rank without gaining substantial negotiating experience. Lief deals internationally in a highly competitive field where one slip can cost you a lot of money. <br /> <br />The two authors have put together a list of Top Ten Negotiating Points on which the book is based. Teaching the real-life application of the ten points, they use stories from their experiences and what they've learned from others. Becker wrote the first portion of the book; life wrote the second portion. The third portion is a summary of a set of interviews, conducted by Becker, of people the authors consider to be effective negotiators.  <br /> <br />The style of the authors is light, but content-filled. At several points in the book, I felt that I was being dragged through a story that took me far afield from the topic of negotiating. Then, the light dawned and I realized that I'd just been taught some more about the topic. The book goes beyond business negotiating to demonstrate that getting what you want is a life skill. The authors are a bit irreverent at times, but if you've read Becker's other books you know that this is part of who he is. He takes what he does seriously, but that's where his seriousness stops. The interviews toward the end of the book seemed lighter than what I expected-disappointing, but there are nuggets there, too. When you read between the lines, a skill of negotiating, you \\"see\\" more than what appears on the printed page. <br /> <br />Good book for sales professionals, businesspeople in all fields, parents, and well-just about anyone. It's not heavy, but it's educational, fun, and only $17.95. <br />	2005-02-13

Human resources executives are naturally concerned about what's coming. Part of their job is to prepare for future workforce and workplace needs and advise senior leaders regarding appropriate strategies. Those senior executives are also beginning to wake up and smell the trends. The smart ones are hungry for the insights that will empower them to lead their organizations boldly into the future. <br /> <br />Harriet Hankin, president of a benefits design consulting and administration firm in the Philadelphia area, brings corporate experience, an ownership role, and the perspective that comes from serving as an objective consultant to corporations. She's obviously done her research in order to present key trends and their impacts. <br /> <br />The book is organized into two sections: The Five Major Emerging Workforce Trends and The Impact of the Trends on Human Resources. Hankin selected five trends; as a futurist by profession, I see a number of others on the horizon. Selecting the more influential trends can always be challenged. This book addresses Longevity, More Varied Household Types, Generations, Diversity, and Trust, Respect, and Ethics.  <br /> <br />The book is written in an almost conversational style, with stories and anecdotes that flavor the text and make the book even more readable. Hankin includes some information which, while it may not be right on target from a serious business perspective, broadens the reader's appreciation of the issues raised. The depth of the author's research comes out in the notes at the end of each chapter. Readers interested in gaining even more knowledge about a topic Hankin discusses will easily be able to follow her research path. Call-out boxes and charts fit well into the book design, enhancing the value for the reader. <br /> <br />In the second section, Hankin shares a treasure chest of ideas that employers may apply. There are enough ideas in these pages to keep a human resources staff busy for quite a while! Among the valuable features I appreciated is a list (on page 181) comparing the kinds of reward priorities that will be preferred by various generations.  <br /> <br />A helpful appendix offers an outline for engaging employees in a future think tank experience to help prepare tomorrow's workforce. A comprehensive index makes it easy to find what you're looking for if, as I expect, you'll want to go back to this book for repeated readings and considerations.  <br /> <br />As a qualifier, I am author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People,\\" a book on the coming shortage of skilled workers. The issues we concentrate on as workforce futurists, are well-addressed in \\"The New Workforce.\\" If you're in management or human resources-or moving in that direction in your career, read this book. <br />	2005-02-02

Corporate transformation. Personal transformation. As I see this book, it's an insightful guide to understanding and leading change. It's a full book, with helpful color illustrations---the kind of manuscript that will consume a considerable amount of time to move through. It's a deep intellectual work, not a pop management publication. <br /> <br />Kilmann begins by focusing the reader on current conditions, then a comparison and comprehension of \\"two dueling paradigms\\" of where we are and where we're going. The new paradigm is explored using the language and concepts of quantum physics that will stimulate and challenge the minds of organizational development readers.  <br /> <br />Most of the book is devoted to an exploration of eight tracks, organized by sections titled Quantum Infrastructures, Formal Systems, and Process Management. The sixth chapter, on Critical Success Factors, intertwines the corporate and the personal with an emphasis on consciousness and meaningfulness. Readers will journey through tracks on culture, skills, teamness, strategy-structure, rewards, gradual process, radical process, and the learning process.  <br /> <br />A broad bibliography and index make this deep content book even more valuable.  <br />	2005-01-24

It's a cost center in the minds of most executives, a necessary (or is it really?) evil.  <br /> <br />With the move toward lean organizations, practically every department is expected to be a profit center instead of a cost burden. \\"If you can't make a positive difference on our bottom line, we'll out-source you\\" is the attitude of many executives today. So Running Training Like a Business is a book for the times. Like it or not, if you're in the training field, you'd better be reading this book. <br /> <br />Credibility. Trainers, like many professionals, are wary of all the garbage that poses as valid information. They need to cut through the noise to get the real meat, and they don't have a lot of time to wade through extraneous space-filling material that doesn't contribute to what they need to know. The authors understand. They're senior executives at The Forum Corporation, one of the premier global consulting firms on training and training management.  <br /> <br />The authors get right into content. No wasted time here. The writing is concise, supported by graphics where needed. Bullet points at the end of each chapter reinforce what needs to be done to achieve solid accomplishment of objectives. It's a good business approach.  <br /> <br />The book is organized into three parts: The Business Case for Transformation, Making the Transformation, and The End of the Beginning. The design is a familiar model to professionals engaged in behavioral change, making the content easier to absorb and apply. Organization change is what this book is all about, and the questionnaires in the back of the book will help the reader assess what needs to be done, progress made, and challenges yet to be overcome. <br /> <br />This book may be a bit difficult, in places, for some trainers. That's understandable; many trainers have not had sufficient exposure to the businessside of business. There's plenty of training language to build comfort and a sense of familiarity, enabling readers to find a number of jumping-off points to stay with the theme.  <br /> <br />As the author of \\"Lean & Meaningful,\\" I can say that what van Adelsberg and Trolley have presented is very congruent with what we see in today's corporate culture. The role of training will grow in importance, but it must also grow in producing and measuring bottom-line results. <br />	2005-01-22

Good people are hard to find...and even harder to keep. Employers who attract, optimize, and retain top talent will have a substantial competitive advantage over those who fail to pay attention to their most important resource.  <br /> <br />The key is leadership. Period. End of story. Leadership effectiveness spells the difference between organizations that succeed, meet and exceed their objectives, and consistently stay at the top of their game. If you're a leader-in any kind of an organization, you would be well-advised to engage a consultant to work with your senior team and other people responsible for goal achievement. You'd be wise to hire a Certified Management Consultant who specializes in leadership effectiveness. <br /> <br />Alternatively, you could bring in a Master Certified Coach who works with individuals to help them achieve their best performance. This kind of highly competent coach enables senior leaders and other key individuals to fulfill their potential so their entire organization benefits from their effectiveness. <br /> <br />Or you could take advantage of the qualities of both these professionals rolled into one: BobMoore, CMC, MCC. With 30 years of experience in helping people and organizations become highly effective, he's an ideal choice to bring focus, energy, and technique to your team. Now you can get Bob Moore in a small package...in his advice-filled book on how to invigorate leaders at all levels, and the people who work for them. <br /> <br />Understandably, Moore focuses on the people side of the business. That's the area that holds the most exposure, the most risk, and the most opportunity. Having good people on your team isn't enough. They must want to be there and they must want to perform at high levels. Leadership. What can you-as a leader or future leader-do to inspire ordinary people to do the extraordinary? <br /> <br />Moore's solution is presentedin seven keys. As you read his book, you'll learn from a down-to-earth consultant who's \\"been there, done that.\\" He tells it like it is, no punches pulled. He \\"talks\\" like a consultant, a coach, an advisor, a friend. You'll feel like a favored client, learning about diagnosis, practice, and getting results. At the end of each chapter, your coach will present the key points to \\"get,: to remember. Nope, you're not done. Moore will challenge you to develop an action plan, expecting you to identify the principal concept you got from the chapter and how you will begin applying your new knowledge within the next 48 hours. Yes, this is an action-oriented tool. You'll get assignments to complete to help you lock in the learning.  <br /> <br />A reading list, bibliography, and a questionnaire will help jump-start your results.  <br /> <br />This review is based on the second edition of this title.

Compared to other books in the field of the lives of older citizens, this is not a guidebook. This volume will not tell you how to deal with taxes, medicare, sex, or estate planning. The other phrase on the front cover is the true description: \\"65 Inspiring Stories That Can Renew Your Life.\\" <br /> <br />The stories illustrate that people after (you pick the age) have all sorts of opportunities available to them to live life to the fullest. There's no reason to stop-or even slow down-when you reach some chronological milestone. Each of these stories is inspiring unto itself, so you can imagine what a whole book of these anecdotes must be! I enjoyed reading page after page, finding myself eager to return to bed each night to lift this book from my bedside table to learn more.  <br /> <br />While the stories are inspiring, they are also instructive. As you learn what people have done with their lives, and look at the positive difference they've made, you'll find yourself challenged to emulate them. Considering carefully the lessons of what they have accomplished-and how they did it, you'll see some stepping stones to the path into your later years. Each of us can make a difference-some large, some much smaller. Reading this book might energize you to make a more significant difference than you believe is possible at the moment.  <br /> <br />Enjoy \\"It's Never Too Late to Plant a Tree,\\" then take some action to make a difference in your life and in the lives of others. <br />	2005-01-02

When Gordon Bethune, then President and CEO of Continental Airlines, wrote \\"From Worst to First\\" in 1999, executives in all fields were fascinated by his tale of how he turned around a company that many had given up for dead. He told the story and unquestionably his leadership was paramount in Continental's incredible success. Of course, as you might expect from a true leader, he shared the achievement with everyone in the organization.  <br />The tale of the turnaround, the awards, and the ongoing success helped thousands of executives and managers improve their operations. <br /> <br />Now Al Stubblefield steps forward in his role as President and CEO of Baptist Health Care in Pensacola, Florida. When he assumed this leadership position in 1999, he faced major challenges...but he and his team were already on the journey to excellence. The picture was bleak when the transformation began in 1995: patient satisfaction was at an all-time low, morale was dangerously low.  <br /> <br />The 5,500 employees of this largest healthcare organization in northwest Florida worked together to become recognized by FORTUNE magazine as one of the 100 Best Places to Work, was recognized as an Employer of Choice , and received the Malcolm Baldrige Award in 2004. The story of how this was accomplished rivals the saga of Continental Airlines. The Baptist Health Care achievement ranks as one of the most valuable case studies you'll read.  <br /> <br />Stubblefield takes you on their journey, explaining what was done and how it was done. Examples and illustrations illuminate the text, making the path even easier to follow. Applying what you'll learn in these pages will empower you to move your organization, regardless of your field of endeavor, to substantially higher levels of performance.  <br /> <br />Read this book now...before your competitors do! <br />	2004-12-14

I review business books, primarily, though I do read and review other genres from time to time. The book was given to me by the author when I spoke at a professional conference which she attended. I opened the cover on the plane on the way home...and couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating story of the conversion of a transsexual from a male body (Ron) to a female body (Rhonda). Since childhood, Ron had felt like he was a female trapped in a male body. This concept is difficult to understand and accept, but you'll understand much more as you read the exceptionally well-written account of this person's life. You'll learn so much about Rhonda that you will feel like you know her like an old friend by the time you reluctantly close the back cover.  <br /> <br />Reading this book opened my eyes, my mind, and my heart to a part of society that was totally foreign to me. The story was presented in a way that is not at all offensive, but offers a thorough explanation of Rhonda's life and her multi-faceted transformation. You'll experience the turmoil, the change process, and the joy Rhonda went through over a period of years. Because of the way she wrote her life story, this is much, much more than just a sex change story. It's a human story, filled with all the challenges, engagements, activities, and dedications of a professional faced with major decisions. You may relate personally to some of the aspects of Rhonda's life, enabling you to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation. <br /> <br />Rhonda's story, while an inspirational model for transsexuals, is also a motivational insight for all of us. As you move through the pages, you will be captivated with the writing style that draws you in as you learn what a friend experienced. It's a life story that may move you to make changes-though not as drastic-in your life to achieve your dreams.  <br /> <br />In my work as a management consultant focused on workforce issues, I found this book to be an eye-opening exposure to an aspect of diversity that had been outside my field of knowledge. I encourage you to read it to gain this appreciation for yourself. <br />	2004-12-13

Describing a systems orientation to leadership of people, the authors encourage the use of data, assessments, <br />team work value statements, and their software. <br /> <br />Recognizing that many executives concentrate on the technical aspect of management, using metrics that enable them to measure their performance, the authors focus on \\"making abstract social skills more empirical.\\" I found the text to be similar to other leadership books, but not delivering new knowledge or breakthrough thinking. Chapter 10 (Blueprint for Change) includes an interesting presentation of the process of overcoming resistance and the impact of persistence on achieving change. There were a few other parts of the book that organized thinking in a helpful format, though the authors used a lot of the reader's time quoting other writers in the leadership field. I was hoping for more original work.  <br /> <br />Parts of the book seemed repetitive and, while the authors' software may be helpful, it was mentioned enough that I felt like I was being pitched. Interesting, there was no appendix explaining the software and its applicability. There is an index, but not a bibliography of all the books cited in the text.  <br />	2004-12-12

We've all used the expression \\"everything you ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask.\\" This information-packed book goes even further. <br /> <br />The author is an MD who specialized in respiratory medicine. He invested successfully over two decades, learning more and more about how to build and manage wealth. Over time, we might say he converted his hobby into a new profession, earning an MBA and earning the well-respected Certified Financial Planning designation.  <br /> <br />Employing what might be described as an effective \\"bedside manner,\\" Dr. Podnos explains a wide range of investment and tax strategies in terms that make sense even to the uninitiated. And, since the book is directed toward people who already have knowledge (subtitle: A Practical Guide to Financial Planning for Affluent Investors), it could be construed to be even more understandable. I approached this book as having minimal knowledge of financial planning and was able to comprehend and appreciate the teachings.  <br /> <br />Readers will gain a clear message that each individual will benefit most from a tailored plan, one that meets specific needs and circumstances. With the complexity of available alternatives, the most wise strategy is to engage a professional financial planner who works for you-rather than earning compensation from the sale of securities, insurance, or other instruments. The author even tells you, in his numerous resource listings (at the end of each chapter) how to find Certified Financial Planners. The book will educate you enough to know what questions to ask...at least to start.  <br /> <br />You'll learn about investing, retirement planning, education planning, risk management and asset protection, health and disability planning, life insurance and annuities, charitable planning, estate planning, tax planning, and working with advisors. As you can see, this book is certainly comprehensive. It's a thought-provoking guidebook that has value for investors--and potential investors--at all levels. <br />	2004-12-08

I went through that experience, and recovered. I still have vivid memories of living a great number of the symptoms that are included in the classic definitions of job burnout. It's not pretty. Everyone in the world of work is advised to learn the warning signs, the avoidance techniques, and the secrets to leading a happy life with stress under control. <br /> <br />Bob Losyk's book will tell you how. <br /> <br />With my intimate knowledge of the field of stress, from living the out-of-control side to managing it well today, I found this book to be the most thorough I've read on the topic. Losyk explains stress, stressors, and symptoms with a breadth and depth that covers everything the reader needs to know. I was pleasantly surprised by the volume of information he managed to squeeze into these pages. Even with anecdotes to illustrate his themes, there are few wasted words in this book. And that's important: people with stress problems have little patience with rambling!  <br /> <br />The book is comprehensive, addressing meditation, diet, exercise, time management, and so much more. His \\"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Stressors\\" is filled with practical advice. Challenged readers could even start there and be ready for instant progress. Just thumbing through the book and looking at the boxes with assessments, action plans, and capsulized knowledge will be a valuable experience.  <br /> <br />The book might have benefited from an index, but the table of contents is detailed enough the help the reader find specific information easily.  <br /> <br />With the pressures of work, career, and questions about whether to stay or go, this book offers powerful support for management and non-management workers alike. As lead author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People,\\" I'm keenly aware of what is happening-and what will be happening-in the workplace. Losyk's  book will be a vital tool (perhaps a life-saver) for a lot of people. <br />	2004-12-05

Delightful. Read it now.	I am a self-confessed fan of Susan RoAne and her work. Recognized internationally as \\"the networking maven,\\" she knows her specialty well and communicates it effectively. And that won't be my last understatement! <br /> <br />Essentially, RoAne's message is that you create your own luck by reaching out to others, by building relationships, and by practicing proven techniques of opening the doors of opportunity before you hear the knock. The book is built around eight traits of success: <br />Talk to strangers, make small talk, drop names, eavesdrop and listen, ask for and offer help, stray from your chosen path, exit graciously without burning bridges, and say \\"yes\\" when you want to say \\"no.\\" <br /> <br />As you move smoothly through the pages of this book (it's written to be read easily), you will enjoy focused illustrations that illuminate the vital traits. RoAne shares a wealth of meaningful stories that bring her messages to life, then explains again the process to follow to achieve your desired results. You can tell this book was written by a former teacher; the emphasis on learning shines through. Each teaching is an inspiration; readers will find themselves motivated to put their new knowledge to work. Summaries and action plan starters at the end of each chapter encourage application of the learnings. For some, the experience may be, in at least a small way, life-changing.  <br /> <br />In the first paragraph of this review, I used the word \\"maven.\\" This is a Yiddish word meaning \\"an expert, a knowledgeable person.\\" That definition is one of many that are included in a glossary at the end of this book. RoAne uses several Yiddish terms in her writing, so the reader gains an understanding of this language. There's even a thorough index to add value to this volume.  <br /> <br />\\"How to Create Your Own Luck\\" is highly recommended for everyone who wants to smooth their path through life. It will be particularly valuable for people in business (not just sales), entrepreneurs, students entering the world of work, prospective retirees...and the list goes on. Your biggest challenge will come when you finish reading the book: you'll have to decide if you want to covet it, or pass it along to someone else. <br />	2004-12-05

It's one of the risks and realities of leadership. The secret, someone once said, is not to make the same mistake twice. A deeper secret is not to make the mistake the first time! If you can avoid the mistakes by learning from others, you'll be ahead of the game.  <br /> <br />Now, if you only had a mentor who could guide you along your career path...a coach who could just point out some mistakes that you could avoid. Enter: Stephen Roulac, a Certified Management Consultant with decades of advisory experience. He doesn't have all the answers, and a lot of his comments are very tight and to-the-point. Not a lot of extra words-or explanations-in these pages. Yet, in page after page, Roulac delivers warnings about common mistakes in Plans and Goals, Strategy, Values, Mission, Vision, Decisions, Operating Philosophies, Finance and Accounting, Purchasing and Supply Chain, Styles and Priorities, Management Behavior, Individual Style, Competition and Markets, Perspective and Viewpoints, Marketing and Sales, Leadership, and more. <br /> <br />This book will give you a lot to think about, in nugget form. You'll find much more breadth than depth here, with enough of a range of topics that you'll be stimulated to talk with others about their experiences and perspectives. <br /> <br />The final section of the book offers cogent advice on recognizing and avoiding mistakes. Valuable for new or experienced leaders. Great reference book to have sitting on your shelf. <br />	2004-11-27

A number of books have been written on ways to get people to sign on, to agree, to perform. Applying the principles they promote will generate performance, adherence, and a certain degree of loyalty. Full commitment is a different issue.  <br /> <br />Richards presents an approach that is balanced between intellectual commitment, emotional commitment, and spiritual commitment. Emphasizing the art of leadership, he shows how leaders can craft deeper relationships that generate genuine commitment to produce meaningful achievement and fulfilling satisfaction.  <br /> <br />In the area of intellectual commitment, four chapters present the elements of insight, vision, storytelling, and mobilizing. Under emotional commitment, the chapters address self-awareness, emotional engagement, and fostering hope. Rendering significance, enacting beliefs, and centering build the understanding of spiritual commitment. The wrap-up chapter is titled Towering Conclusions and Further Strategies. A brief list of resources (interviewees and websites) and an index complement the text. Each chapter concludes with a handful of questions to stimulate contemplation. <br /> <br />The entire text stimulates contemplation. Using a wide range of people and their experiences and philosophies, Richards engages the reader in an introspective and educational journey. In chapter after chapter, I found myself inspired and enlightened, motivated to apply what I was learning in my work.  <br /> <br />You will find this book to be a sort of combination of a walk in the woods, a comfortable soak in a hot tub, and time in a classroom with an energetic professor scribbling concepts rapidly across a white board while his writing hand struggles to keep up with his mind. Plan on reading this book twice; you won't get it all the first time. Margaret Thatcher's quote will help you understand that opportunity. <br />	2004-11-14

Most readers will recognize at least one, if not several, embarrassing (and probably costly) mistakes that have already been made. These mistakes, and many like them, could have been avoided by a careful read of this book.<br /><br />This comfortingly thick volume is organized into the following main sections, with chapters under each heading: Strategy Management Operations, Deals/Deal-Making, Space, Place, and the all-important How You Can Avoid Mistakes. Each of the 275 potential mistakes is presented briefly. The write-ups are more reminders and memory joggers-briefly instructive, rather than in-depth treatments of the topics. In many of the explanations, I found myself wanting more detail, while appreciating the warning that the mistake could cost me in many ways.<br /><br />The table of contents is comprehensive, enabling the reader to locate by category the topic(s) of interest. As a reference book, the volume would have been more valuable with an index.<br /><br />For corporate leaders, business owners, and even corporate real estate professionals who think they already have all the answers, this volume will serve a valuable purpose. If you are considering any kind of a real estate move, first move through the pages of this book.	2004-11-01

He certainly has the credentials to write a thorough, broadly instructive book on effective employee relations. From that perspective, this book was disappointing. <br /> <br />There is a lot of information in this short book, but the view is wide and shallow. Each of the topics addressed could have been more thoroughly explored, adding value for the reader. However, for the reader looking for a decent overview, the book could be a valuable tool. The book's title suggests that it's designed for busy managers, but even busy managers need more than the quick look they'll get in these pages. <br /> <br />The publisher didn't do this book any favors. I was distracted by poor design-it's hard to separate the page headings from the text, grammar and spelling problems, and a sans-serif type with an unusually large amount of space between the lines. It appears that the publisher was trying to make a short manuscript appear longer by adding a lot of extra white space.  <br /> <br />I found myself wishing that the author had invested more time in developing his manuscript and/or the publisher had asked for more content. The index is a mere one page in length-and in a different type style than the rest of the book. The value of the book is diminished by the poor production values. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this publication is a light-weight entry into a field that is crying for heavy-weight content. Perhaps the author will invest more time to create something more than a quick-and-dirty look with a sales message. I was hoping for much more than I got. <br />	2004-10-31

Would you like to work with a coach who will give you a simple plan, convincing back-up research, and a sense of being challenged to perform? Warning: Simple as it sounds, this is not easy work. However, Dr. Pam Brill-psychologist, coach, seminar leader, and consultant-will be with you every step.  <br /> <br />This is not a book that you can read quickly, toss it aside, and be cured of everything that has inhibited your high achievement. The pages are full of strong content that will take a while to get through. Reading, absorbing, and benefiting from \\"The Winner's Way\\" is more of a project than it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon read. If you're ready to make the commitment, investing your time, attention, and energy with this volume will pay great dividends. <br /> <br />The book is organized into twelve chapters, an appendix, endnotes, and an index. Well constructed. The first part of the book introduces the reader to a range of concepts that will help focus the attention on what needs to be done, and why. Brill starts with the idea of being in \\"the zone,\\" an important part of her work and philosophy. Using vignettes to illustrate her points-and capture the reader's mind and spirit, the author presents the experience of the intensity, the full focus, that enables people to achieve at high levels.  <br /> <br />Brill's research \\"concluded that there are three core elements that, when aligned at optimum levels, hold the power to boost you into and keep you in the Zone: Activation, Attention, and Attitude.\\" Brill explains each of these elements, then works with you to activate these powers to achieve.  <br /> <br />If you're not where you want to be, if you're not a winner in practically everything you do, this book can be a tool that will help you move to that special space in The Zone of achievement. If you're ready, I recommend you purchase this book and get to work. <br />	2004-10-31

What would you ask them? Would you enjoy getting to know them and yearn to begin applying what you learn to make a difference in your own life-and the lives of others? What questions would you ask them to unlock the secrets of their success? <br /> <br />Oh, you might be a little bit intimidated to ask personal questions, like \\"what is your secret of success?\\" \\"What are their best practices?\\" You want to know what really makes them so successful, what makes it all come together. It might be helpful to have someone else ask those questions on your behalf. Keith Harrell is a been there-done that motivational speaker who knows how to get inside the issues to learn the real truths. That insight is what makes him one of the most popular figures on the speaking circuit today. <br /> <br />In these pages, Keith (you'll feel like you're friends from the beginning) takes us on an exciting and enlightening journey. Not only does he dig in to get profound answers for his readers, he offers his own expansion of the leaders' responses...with challenges for us to consider how we might want to apply the learnings to change our own lives. Each chapter concludes with a sort of official biography in smaller type to help us understand who we're learning from. In putting this book together, Harrell has selected well-known and not-so-well-known leaders. Each has an important message to share, and the author's style brings those messages to life. And, as a bonus, there's an extra chapter filled with a sort of rapid-fire collection of insights from other people Keith wants to share with us.  <br /> <br />An index enhances the value of the book.

A written version of an American Management Association seminar, this publication is essentially a combination of some instructional text and a workbook. The pages are filled with fill-in blanks, check-off boxes, and similar exercises found in a seminar workbook.  <br /> <br />This concise work meets its objectives of providing a self-learning tool addressing the fundamentals of management. Readers seeking something more sophisticated than a seminar workbook should look elsewhere. <br /> <br />The book is organized into eight chapters, seven presenting content and a wrap-up summary. Topics of the instructional chapters are Defining Your Role, Effective Communication, Performance Management, the Four Phases of Learning, Motivation, Delegation, and Coaching. Action-step exercises are provided at the end of each chapter to help the reader focus new knowledge on personal performance. The eighth chapter offers another form to re-cast what was written at the end of the chapters to create a big picture of forward movement.  <br /> <br />For people looking for a simplified, yet wide-ranging and current, introduction to the basics of front-line management, this book fills a need. The workbook format means that the engaged reader will write answers to a lot of questions and exercises while moving through the pages, rather than simply reading text to grasp the new concepts. <br />	2004-10-28

It's an issue, a science, a research endeavor, a discovery, a breakthrough that affects all of us. DNA is in the news, in some context, practically every day. Science is unquestionably a central part of our lives-today and in the future. But why did AMACOM, a publisher of business books, produce a book on genomics? This doesn't sound like a business topic. <br /> <br />Going beyond our initial reaction, we quickly see that the recent discoveries-and their applications-are indeed vital to business development. DNA won't tell you how to manage your people or your finances more effectively, but this book will deliver insights and simulate thinking that will influence thousands of businesses for years to come. <br /> <br />DNA research, with relatively recent discoveries, will drive the development of business endeavors that are the next wave of corporate birth. New companies will spring up to engage in more research in this emerging field, ushering in an era of business development built around DNA, genomics, biogenetics, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, education, and other aspects of our lives. Gaining a fundamental, yet comprehensive, understanding of genomics will give present and future corporate leaders at least an intellectual edge. Having read this book, I can better appreciate what I'm reading in the newspapers and magazines each day about this exploding field. <br /> <br />So who's the author? It's not some little-known scientist who will obfuscate the topic with complicated terminology. This book for Everyman was written by one of America's best-known science and technology journalists. Gina Smith was the technology correspondent for ABC news and has amassed over a decade of experience in researching and writing on technology for the Los Angeles Times, Wired, Popular Science, and other print and broadcast news sources. Even though I am not a scientist, I found the book easy to read and understand. Sure, there are some parts that get alittle complicated, but a careful reading will produce significant comprehension. And, if you get confused, there's a 30-page glossary at the end of the book, before the eight-page index, to enlighten you. <br /> <br />Following a helpful introduction, Smith presents ten chapters to organize her material. She begins with an explanation of the basics of the DNA sciences, and then traces the evolution of genomic science from initial discoveries to future opportunities. Applications of DNA knowledge fill the next two chapters, before the book launches into an exploration of specific fields of opportunity. You'll learn about biogerontology-the use of DNA research and manipulation to extend life. Combating cancer, cloning, stem cell research, and gene therapy are all explored. The closing chapter on DNA and Society examines some of the ethical issues that face us as we race into the future with new discoveries and applications.  <br /> <br />Leaders will gain valuable knowledge that will help them understand this new field of research and development. A little corporate thinking-and it won't be much of a stretch-will stimulate your thinking about business opportunities. The quotations that are interspersed in the chapters are a little bit of a distraction, but do break up the text to make the flow more readable. I offer a strong recommendation for this book, which will appeal to a wide audience. <br />	2004-10-25

However, just because we respect the importance of listening doesn't mean that we know what to do...or do it very well. Now we have a guidebook. <br /> <br />Steil and Bommelje are widely respected as experts in the fine skills of effective listening, so they are well-qualified to write this book. Their credentials are impeccable.  <br /> <br />The book presents ten \\"golden rules\\" of listening leadership, organized as Preparation, Principles, and Practices...which lead to taking Meaningful Action. The authors nicely tie together good listening skills and leadership, showing how each skill contributes to and supports the other. Effective listening enables you to be a good leader, and effective leadership encompasses good listening.  <br /> <br />Page after page is filled with teaching, practical advice, and examples of how real leaders use their listening skills to enhance their work. I was struck by the broad variety of leaders cited and with what they had to share through the authors. The wise range of people used as examples in the book serves to reinforce the universality of the principles. The way the teachings of the exemplary leaders are intertwined with the balance of the text enriches the readability of the book: it's almost storytelling-a highly readable novel or collection of vignettes.  <br /> <br />Adding value to the book is a list of the cited leaders, providing each individual's title and organization and the chapter where the leader's advice or experience is shared. The book also provides a list of resources for further research and a helpful index. Summaries at the end of each chapter make it even easier to acquire the vast knowledge included in these pages. <br /> <br />Recommended for current-and future-leaders who seek to strengthen their listening skills and their leadership effectiveness. <br />	2004-10-25

Weirdos? This sounds like a negative term, but it's actually not. Putzier, an experienced and respected human resources professional, consultant, and professional speaker, defines \\"weirdos\\" as people who are not like you. This assessment means that they are abnormal...if we assume that you are normal. <br /> <br />The first section of this book is devoted to presenting a foundation-setting perspective that the workplace is a microcosm of society. Society is in the process of change, moving through the four stages of Stifling, Tolerating, Accepting, and Rejoicing. This same progression occurs in the workplace, seen as The Age of the Organization Man, The Age of Diversity, The Age of the New Economy, and The Age of the Individual. Those of us who have watched the shifts in attitudes and relationships have observed the shift from conformity to expansion and inclusion, to an honoring of expertise and performance. Now, with varying degrees of comfort, we are moving jerkily into an honoring of individuality <br /> <br />In the second section, Putzier describes over thirty different people that could easily be categorized as \\"weird.\\" Another descriptor might be \\"unique.\\" The colorful pictures he paints will stir memories in the minds of the readers, reminding them of the unusual co-workers we have all encountered over the years. Putzier takes diversity to a whole new level. In his vignettes, our author observes that each of these people-and many more that we might call weird-have something significant to contribute. And they all have the potential to be high performers, though not always in the same way that mainstream employees are superior achievers.  <br /> <br />The weirdos are presented in a way that catches your attention and may cause you to smile, shake your head, or roll your eyes. And human resource professionals will bob their heads, recognizing similar situations. But Putzier goes further. Each description is a accompanied by an analysis that includes perspective and advice that stimulates thinking and may influence some more appropriate responses to unusual behavior in the workplace. <br /> <br />The book continues with insights into high performers...an understanding of what makes weirdos tick and accomplish so much. Behavioral change maps guide the reader in valuable methodologies. This is a book that will introduce you to what the author calls \\"the new normal.\\" Indeed, the workforce is changing and will be populated by more free agents...and regular employees who will certainly be recognized as individuals-in every sense of the word. Understand how weirdness is a positive and you'll change your perspective on the world of work.  <br />	2004-09-29

And that's a pretty strong statement from an avid reader and reviewer with over three decades of experience as a management consultant and executive. <br /> <br />Somehow I missed this book when it was first released in 1999 in a hardcover edition. As the authors point out in their introduction, the messages contained in the book are perhaps more relevant today than they were in 1999. We face more challenges, different corporate and operating environments, and greater needs for strong leadership than ever before. Complicating this condition is the serious dearth of leadership in corporate America. Our playing field is no longer level-now more like shifting sands...or shifting geology. Special leadership is needed in times of earthquakes!  <br /> <br />The United States Marine Corps builds leaders, and has for centuries. The application of techniques and values to make a Marine or a Marine officer are powerful and proven; they have stood the test of time. The authors, both former active duty Marines (\\"once a Marine, always a Marine\\"), explain the process and the foundation that makes each Marine and the Corps so well-respected and so effective. These principles really resonated with me as I read page after page, in light of the role of the Marines in the history that leaps out of our front pages every day.  <br /> <br />Each chapter begins with some aspect of how the Marines do it, then relate the principles to business applications. The advice is solid, inspiring, and immediately useful. The content and the writing style held my rapt attention and made me want more. I was actually disappointed when the book ended. And I found myself wishing I had served my country as a Marine instead of a dedicated member of the US Army. Now understanding the difference, I am sorry I missed what Marines get. And, at the same time, I'm anxious to share the message of this book with clients and friends.  <br /> <br/>With a price tag of only $15 retail, corporate leaders can purchase copies of Semper Fi to give to each of their executives and managers...at least. Learn, appreciate, and apply the knowledge in these pages to change your organization into a high performance team. Idea: if your company is fortunate enough to have former Marines or reservists on the payroll, call on them to validate and explain what being a Marine is all about...and what the experience means to them today. <br />	2004-09-09

Awesome!	My title for this book review may seem a bit out of the ordinary, but so is this book. If you're thinking about buying it, you're probably hesitant because of the unusually high price. Forget the high price issue. If you are an executive, a company owner, or a human resource professional, this book has more value-per-page than practically any other book you'll read this year. <br />The whole concept of talent management is undergoing major change. The whole field is in a state of evolution as a result of the economy, technology, new approaches to employment, outsourcing, the increasing use of metrics, the emerging strategic partnership of the CEO and CHRO, legal and ethical issues, diversity, and more. Talent management has turned into a jungle that seems to get thicker with every step we take. <br />With the increasing complication, this field becomes more difficult to understand-at the same time that more people and more companies are entering the arena. Somebody who knows what it's all about needs to write a guidebook that will explain the terms, dig into the issues, and make sense of all this. \\"Talent Management Systems\\" is that book. And Allan Schweyer, Executive Director of the Human Capital Institute, the leading comprehensive not-for-profit organization in the field, is the ideal author.<br />This book covers just about every topic you want to learn about in the talent management arena. The depth is appropriate for the reader who wants a solid overview with enough detail to \\"get\\" the picture...and be able to relate all the parts. My problem in reading it was overcoming my habit of turning down page corners. When you turn down almost every page, you eventually give up and realize that you'll probably use the index for reference and re-read at least parts of the book over and over. <br />In these pages, you'll find lots of best practices. That resource makes this book a valuable asset. Even more valuable, however, is the clarity of presentation as the author explains the terms, the processes, the benefits, and the interrelationships. It's all here. I was a bit concerned when I thumbed through the book and found precious few graphics. As I got into the text, I discovered I didn't need graphics. The illustrative nature of the words is quite sufficient to convey the messages. <br />The book is current, state-of-the-art. If you're in this field, it should be on your shelf-or better: on your desk. If you're considering any aspect of workforce recruitment, management, development, or retention as a career, read the book now. In fact, suggest that your university professor add it to the class reading list. Read the book before you talk with the prof, and you'll probably discover you know a lot more than the academic does! I've been in this field-and its predecessor fields-for over two decades. Remember, I'm the one who was turning pages down. <br />\\"Talent Management Systems\\" is highly recommended for practitioners, aspirants, and the teachers and mentors-who want to help their protégés, but also keep a step ahead of them.	2004-07-07

They range from the get rich quick schemes to solid advice on investments. Some are so thick or so filled with formulas and charts that it takes an economist to understand them. Some are inspirational volumes that are filled with platitudes and little else.<br />In this short book, Siegel spins a story that, at times, almost seems like a fable that's come to life. The story centers on two men having difficulty building wealth and a rich man who mentors them to success. In each chapter, the author imparts, through his fictional wealthy character, advice that we all know but fail to follow religiously. His advisees learn from practicing what they are taught and become successful in their own right. <br />While there are places that the dialog becomes more of a monologue, the rules of wealth accumulation are delivered, illustrated, and repeated for emphasis and easy reference. The teacher-the man behind the curtain of the fictional story-is well-qualified to present this message to his readers. Siegel is a highly successful businessman who functions as an investment advisor and owns two other companies. He knows what he's talking about, and presents the cogent advice in a form that's easy to digest. The story is simple and the presentation is simple.<br />This book is recommended for anyone who wants to learn the steps to accumulated wealth through savings, building, and investing. It's not a deep volume, just comprehensive enough to stand on its own...and perhaps stimulate some readers to explore Siegel's previous books or other books on investing. The best time to begin this kind of program is twenty years ago, to paraphrase one of the quotations Siegel uses to season the book; the second best time is now. This is a valuable book for parents to give their children, so they can start the process early in life.	2004-07-04

Years of political maneuvering, wasteful spending, mismanagement, and an economic roller-coaster have taken their toll. While wonderful innovation has been seen in a number of government agencies at the federal, state, and local level, most have a very long way to go. The resistance to change must be overcome if we are to avoid widespread bankruptcy of the very organizations that we, as taxpayers and citizens, rely on for shared services and support. Change is a community effort, not just something to be delegated to a few elected or appointed officials. But the work to be done is akin to hugging a hippopotamus...especially if the animal doesn't want to be hugged!<br />The authors are consultants-which could be considered good news or bad news. In this case, it's good news. They are founder and senior partner of Public Strategies Group, a firm specializing in the field of improving government. Osborne is author of the best-seller, \\"Reinventing Government.\\" These authors have the credentials that cry out how valuable their book might be.<br />The five sections of the book organize their huge volume of information, commentary, and advice: Smarter Budgeting, Smarter Sizing, Smarter Spending, Smarter Management, and Smarter Leadership. Through fifteen chapters the authors describe what's been happening, the impact, what changes could-or should-be made, and what benefits will result. There are no illustrations in this book-a few charts; it's straight text in page after intriguing page. Tremendous content that can be absorbed in a straight-through read or studied in a reference book fashion.<br />Community leaders will find an incredible amount of material to work with in these pages. The question is how many communities will have sufficiently strong and committed leadership-political and apolitical-to overcome the resistance of tradition and self-serving turf protection in order to bring about critically needed change. If you can build the community resources to make the needed improvements, this book will be a real treasure for exploring opportunities and finding wise solutions.	2004-06-06

As a book reviewer, I can't tell you. There is nothing in his book that offers an author profile, biography, or credentials. I'm often inspired to read books because of the qualifications that give the author authenticity and standing to present ideas for my consideration. Without this knowledge, I was handicapped, but was attracted to the volume partly by the title, and partly by the subtitle.<br />The word \\"killer\\" implies to me that the strategies or tactics presented in the book will equip me to dominate the competition. Customer CARE, rather than the customary use of the word SERVICE, also caught my attention. The subtitle referring to \\"customer service that will double and triple profits\\" validates that the author recognizes the relationship between taking care of the customer and taking care of the bottom line. Unfortunately, acknowledging that critical relationship is missing from most how-to books in this field.<br />The 25 chapters of this book are organized into four sections: The One Critical Factor for Success in the 21st Century, Laying the Groundwork for Killer Customer Care, Implementing Your Killer Customer Care Program, and Keeping Your Killer Customer Care Program on Track. The titles of the chapters alone will stimulate and remind you of things that must be done, and will guide you to practical tactics and illustrations of the techniques. The organization of the book, presented in the table of contents, makes this a good book to read from cover to cover, as well as an easy-to-use reference tool. A comprehensive index adds to the value. <br />Colombo emphasizes his position that service is more transaction-oriented, compared to customer care that implies a long-term relationship. While that position is stated clearly, the distinction is not carried through with an obvious emphasis in the text. The same deficiency occurs with the \\"killer\\" concept: the word \\"killer\\" is used in the text, it is applied more as a contextual theme, rather that a differentiating factor. The book does not compare traditional customer service with killer customer care as it could to make the concept really come alive. Opening comments suggest the book is intended for senior executives, yet the unusual size of the book and cover design are atypical for what would appeal to executives.<br />Killer Customer Care is filled with valuable tactics, including important management considerations such as measurement and teaching of the concepts. It will be a worthwhile read for owners of small and medium-sized businesses seeking approaches to building long-term relationships with customers. It's definitely a management book, rather than one to be read by the people on the front line who are most responsible for generating the kind of customer care that establishes and sustain lifetime-value loyalty. This book will also be valuable for managers of franchises, dealerships, and branch locations of larger companies. It portrays the role, and how to support it, in ways that will equip managers to carry the message to their people.	2004-06-03

Yet, his principles still apply today, particularly in the conduct of business. There are many lessons to be learned.<br />Gary Gagliardi is acknowledged as America's leading authority on Sun Tzu, so he has a deep understanding of the teachings of the philosopher and his perspectives on war. The approach he takes is that the art of war is much deeper than just fighting battles. In fact, confrontations are best avoided, according to the concepts explored in the book.<br />The author explains that all ancient Chinese philosophy and science was based on diagrams. Those diagrams are included in the book with explanations and interpretations that relate the ancient teaching to today's environment. Gagliardi has already written about the application of Sun Tzu's teaching to sales, marketing, management, and other modern endeavors.<br />The organization of the book forces the reader to move slowly to gain understanding and appreciation of the Master's ideas. The teachings, the interpretation of the diagrams are presented on the left hand pages. On the opposite right hand pages, the author relates the insights to current applications. Reading and absorbing the contents of this book will give the readers strength to think and perform differently-more wisely-in managing both business and personal endeavors. Each of us is engaged in competition, the basis of Sun Tzu's teachings.<br />The writings include the Chinese words next to the concepts. While this gives the text an air of greater authenticity and linkage with the original thinking, it can be distracting as this writing technique interrupts the speed of flow of reading...which may be another benefit of the way the book is written. The greatest value from this book will be your contemplation of the application of the principles in your own life.	2004-06-03

Sales professionals, managers and executives, and practically anyone in contact with others in a \\"white collar\\" environment will benefit from this handbook. I would particularly recommend this publication for graduates-both college and high school-entering the job market. Following the advice in these pages will undoubtedly energize your career advancement more quickly.<br />In twelve chapters, Ramsey, a 30-year business etiquette specialist with 30 years of speaking and seminar experience, presents a wide range of essential topics. In spite of the fact that the author has been in business for three decades, the material presented is current and relevant to today's business environment.<br />Ramsey begins with a chapter on first impressions, then moves into how to introduce yourself and others, engage in appropriate conversation, and dress properly in both professional and business casual modes. The chapter on phone courtesy is comprehensive; I wish it could be read by everyone I call or who calls me! The electronic etiquette section is fundamental now, but some readers will pick up a couple of tips here. Other chapters deal with business correspondence, office etiquette, gift-giving, dining, and doing business internationally. <br />In each chapter, the topics are presented in bite-sized chunks that make for easy reading and digestion of the volume of information provided. A blank page section at the conclusion of each chapter gives the reader a convenient place to make notes about other learnings or things to remember. While an index might have helped this book be even more useful, the table of contents is arranged in a way that makes specific information easy to find. This is a book you'll keep for future reference.<BR> <BR>Roger Herman, author of &quot;How To Choose Your Next Employer&quot; and other books.	2004-05-24

This book, written by an independent security consultant specializing in identity theft, presents a wealth of fascinating facts about the crime, its growth, how to prevent it, and what to do if you're a victim.<br />One of the facts brought out in the book highlights the importance of prevention: the average reporting time-discovery-of the crime is fourteen months after the damage has been done! Consider this little book to be a wake-up call and heed the advice carefully.<br />The first 91 pages are devoted to an insightful-and sometimes astonishing-report of what identity theft is all about. Readers will gain a broad education and learn about vulnerabilities they'd never even dreamed of! With the problem clearly delineated, May spends the balance of the book providing a comprehensive listing of resources, advice, and tools for prevention and response.<br />This book should be read carefully by anyone with a credit card, social security number, driver's license, checking account... Get it? Everyone! Employers will benefit from the book, as well, particularly if their employees-or others (explained in the book)-have access to personal information about employees, customers, or even suppliers.<br />Highly recommended. Content and readability give this book a great return on your investment of the purchase and reading time.	2004-05-18

The most vital-and most difficult-task is promoting the book so that people will buy it. Distributors are fond of saying to authors, \\"Our job is to get the book onto the shelf; your job is to get it off.\\"<br />In ten chapters, this author presents the how-to, step-by-step, of how to promote a book to distributors, retailers, and consumers. She covers a lot of ground to help authors get the word out. Plenty of examples to give authors guidance.

Her experience includes writing over 1,000 articles. From my research on amazon.com, this appears to be her first book. She uses herself heavily in her examples, to the point that this reviewer felt the book was bordering on self-promotion. With her experience as a publisher and a magazine editor, she has gained a body of knowledge that is valuable for authors. The knowledge is conveyed effectively in this book. Authors would be well-advised to read and heed the advice in these pages.	2004-05-02

The economy, the impact of 9/11, war, political rhetoric, unemployment, uncertainty, and just the pressure to do more with less has presented untold challenges. Everyone is so busy that balancing all the things on the to-do list has become nearly impossible. \\"Stop the merry-go-round! I want to get off!\\"<br />Is there no serenity anymore? Is there no way to get away from all the noise...even if that noise is in our heads? Reading this book, and thinking about its messages, will move you to a different space...if even for a brief time. <br />I started reading the 52 chapters at the rate of one each evening before bedtime. 52 chapters = 52 weeks. The more I got into the book, the more I accelerated my reading. I gained something from each brief chapter. Sometimes I learned a new idea, a new approach, a new way of looking at something. In other cases, I was gaining some new knowledge and insight-things I hadn't really thought about before. <br />Joan Borysenko is an expert in stress, spirituality, and mind-body connection. As a no-nonsense businessman, I've avoided the spirituality and mind-body stuff...until recently. Maybe I'm getting older; maybe I'm becoming more sensitive; maybe I can benefit from these approaches more than I thought I could. This Inner Peace book makes the process comfortable; I don't feel discomfort at all in reading it. No \\"woo-woo\\" alarms sounding.<BR>This is good stuff. <br />You'll find Borysenko's writing easy to work with and absorb. Her personal stories engage the reader with the perspectives and advice she shares. Whether you read a chapter a week or read straight through, this is a book with value for you, personally.	2004-04-26

It was confusing for me as a reader, possibly based on my expectations.<br />Based on the subtitle of the book, I expected that I might see a card deck kind of format clearly presented. I imagined perhaps 52 great ideas that I could use to build my effectiveness. The fan of playing cards on the book cover reinforced that expectation. When I finally got past the pages of the publisher's advertising to reach the table of contents, I found that there were nine \\"hands,\\" an introduction, a preparatory chapter, and a conclusion. Each hand (examples: attitude, visibility, style, listening, learning) in the table of contents has categories that highlight information and advice that would be helpful for anyone looking for some self-improvement help. There are graphics of success cards at the end of each chapter, but the graphics were not emphasized as well as they could be in the chapters. This is a design issue, rather than content, but the design affects the readability of the book.<br />Some \\"players\\" are introduced in the first chapter, representing composites of readers. The idea here, I believe, is that readers would be able to identify with these characters as they move through the book. These characters do stay with us through the book, but an army of other people pop in and out as examples in various vignettes. This parallel theme confused me as I was trying to follow the players and all the valuable advice being offered by the authors. The result of all these themes, a large number of call-out boxes, and a sans serif typeface made this book seem overly complicated. <br />Unquestionably, there is a lot of valuable advice in these pages, but be prepared to separate the book you'd like to read from the others that seem to be interwoven with it. The index, which appears just before the closing advertisements from the Financial Times, is helpful. The conclusion includes a survey with check-boxes that will enable the reader to focus on next-steps.	2004-04-12

Trade Paperback. 160 pages<BR>ISBN 1-57090-195-3<BR>$12.00<br />Captivating!<br />Ever read one of those books you just didn't want to put down? Here's another one! <br />This is a well-written tale of four men who travel to Tanznia to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. The men don't know each other before the trip, but bond and share as the climb progresses. Told from the perspective of one of the climbers, the story is intriguing and vivid. I felt like I was right there with the climbers and, as the story moved forward, inspired to travel to Africa to make the climb myself.<br />The author has made the climb twice, so the descriptions and story line are accurate and compelling. The promotional copy for the book suggests that the primary theme of the book is how the four men overcome their personal struggles. Anticipating one of those sappy moralistic tales, I braced myself for the Lessons Learned messages stuffed between paragraphs or at the end of chapters. <br />Surprise! No interruptions. No moralizing. No preaching. No psychologists lurking behind the next snowbank. The messages, the learnings, are there, but subtle. <br />This is a good read for those who enjoy inspirational books, for people who would like to learn and grow from learning about unusual experiences, and for young folks who have little appreciation of hardship and life beyond their limited knowledge. Recommended.	2004-03-19

When I picked up this book, I expected to find some interesting insights into why KMart, once so widely known and popular, ran into all its problems. A company whose stores were once part of the American landscape and whose blue light specials were exciting mini-events, spun into bankruptcy on January 22, 2002. What happened?<br />I looked at the author's credentials and, frankly, was a bit dismayed that she was author of \\"The Unofficial Guide to Starting a Small Business.\\" Even though the title is described as a best-seller, I questioned whether such an author would be able to produce the kind of study that the K-Mart subject demands. Looking further through the book, I discovered that my concerns were totally unfounded. This book is quite well researched, as evidenced by the abundant footnotes at the end of each chapter. Turner lists, in her acknowledgements, some of the people she conferred with in putting this book together. Impressive. Almost academic. <br />The book begins with two features I appreciated. One was a chapter, called the introduction, which effectively sets the stage for the in-depth look at what happened... and why. The other feature is a time line that includes progressive events at Kmart and at Wal-Mart. A fascinating fact to ponder is that Kmart and Wal-Mart were started in the same year. Throughout the book, Turner interweaves and compares the strategies-and implications-of Kmart, Wal-Mart, and Target, as well as other retailers. This approach adds value to this book for every retailer-every business leader-who designs strategy with anticipated results. The bibliography and comprehensive index make this book a most usable tool.<br />A chapter is devoted to each of the Deadly Sins: Brand Mismanagement, Lack of Customer Knowledge, Underestimating Wal-Mart, Lousy Locations, Ignoring Store Appearance, Technology Aversion, Supply Chain Disconnect, Lack of Focus, Strategy du Jour, and Repeating the Same Mistakes. You'll learn about strategic blunders, tactical mismanagement, and operation deficiencies that crippled the potentially powerful chain retailer. Details even go down to the level of describing how insufficient staffing levels in the stores confounded efforts to keep the aisles clear of incoming merchandise, let alone serve the customer. <br />While you'll shake your head numerous times as you read this educational and insightful book, you'll gain new perspectives and cautions in the way you run your own business and life. Highly recommended.	2004-01-06

They could probably all apply to Mary Todd Lincoln, the woman behind the 16th President of the United States. Abraham Lincoln has been the subject of a considerable amount of historical writing, both fiction and non-fiction.<br />Loving Mr. Lincoln is beautifully written, captivating historical fiction. The reader is asked to believe that Mary Todd Lincoln's diaries were discovered in an old trunk purchased at a flea market. The tale is certainly feasible, grabbing the reader's attention immediately. <br />What follows is a representation of what Mary Todd's diary might have been from December 13, 1939 to the day her husband was shot at Ford's Theatre, April 15, 1865. In between, the reader will find page after fascinating page of dated diary entry records that seem awfully real. As in any well-written historical fiction, I couldn't tell you for sure if what I was reading was actually written by Mary Lincoln. <br />Frankly, the more I read, the less I cared about who wrote the words, the alleged diarist or Kay duPont. I was hooked. The experience of viewing history through the eyes of this controversial figure was intriguing. I learned a lot, gained a deeper appreciation for the human side of history, and saw the Lincoln legend from a new perspective. The author has obviously done her homework. <br />After you read this book, you'll be telling others how much you enjoyed it. You'll probably agree with the Georgia Writers Association that Loving Mr. Lincoln deserves the recognition they bestowed as the winner of their Fiction Award. Prepare to be engaged from the first page!	2003-12-19

Motivation of employees through rewards and recognition is critically important for organizational success. This topic is vital for supervisors, managers, executives, human resource professionals, business owners...the list goes on. Your power in this essential part of business is based on how much you know about what works, what doesn't work, and why. The more examples you can glean about what others are doing, the stronger you will be.<br />Nelson and Spitzer are internationally known experts in rewards and recognition. They both know their topic extremely well, and that high level of expertise comes out in this book. Readers familiar with the field will think they already have the answers if they have previous books written by these authors. Guess again!<br />This book is packed with information, insights, tips, ideas, case studies-you name it. Have you ever packed a suitcase so full that it was almost impossible to close it? That's the experience you'll have with this field book. You'll wonder how these gurus ever got this much stuff packed in between those two covers. Just a few pages of reading and you'll already be on information overload!<br />There are so many features in this publication, I'll probably not be able to name them all. (Do you hear enthusiasm in my review?) Case studies. End of chapter summaries. Good table of contents. Vignettes describing positive-and negative-experiences. Over 40 no-cost ideas. Worksheets. Resources. Training designs. Reminder cards. Comprehensive index. On and on and on. There are at least four separate books in these pages, all jammed into one tremendous resource. <br />Bob Nelson's \\"1001 Ways to Reward Employees\\" has sold over a million copies. This book is even more of a value...especially at the surprisingly modest price. There is no question that this volume will have an impact on readers and the organizations they serve. Even just modest application of the knowledge found in this tool chest will return many more times the investment of the purchase and the time to read all that the authors share.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-03

If you are one of those people who continually looks for shortcuts to overcome the overwhelming feeling of overdoing your life, this book is for you. If you are not one of those people, you're probably confounding things for the rest of us-so this book is for you. <br />If you already seek ways to simplify your life, a lot of the material in this book will stimulate a \\"Duh\\" reaction: I already know this stuff. Very good! A gold star for you. Now here's the Big Question: are you actually employing Jensen's simplicity techniques to do less and accomplish more? Or are you one of those well-intentioned people who needs a swift kick every once in a while to get you back on track? This book is full of swift kicks. <br />A word of caution. If you do all these things as well as the author would expect, you will probably alienate some people who don't get it yet. Be prepared. You may want to temper some of the applications with a little wisdom and sensitivity to the folks you interact with. Chapter 1 is How to Ignore Most Corporate Communications. While there could be a lot of value in that practice, there's also an inherent risk. This juxtaposition runs throughout the book as Jensen somewhat irreverently pokes fun at what so many of us do just because we've always.... You know the drill. Ready to change?<br />In addition to the read-through text, which can also be used as a reference-thanks to a clear Table of Contents and a triple-comprehensive index, there are tear-out pages with compressed advice clearly presented on single pages. Triple-index? Yes, there are three indexes: by subject, by people, and by organization. <br />Prepare to feel lectured-to. You'll probably have that feeling in many sections of this book, because you deserve it. Accept what you'll get, trusting in this consultant who understands the topic well enough to write a book that's full of valuable content. The trick is to apply what you learn. That important step will give you great return on your investment in this volume.<br />Note: the author also wrote Simplicity. This book could be perceived as a companion to that work, but it stands alone nicely.	2003-11-28

Is this something I want to waste my time with? New-agey. Woo-woo. Recognizing that titles sometimes miss the mark and that there's good stuff between the covers of the book, I moved beyond the front page and into the text. <br />The book begins with our storyteller relating a frustrating experience of being locked in a monumental traffic jam. We can all identify with that scenario. Would you just sit there and wait-especially after a police officer had informed you that the problem wouldn't be cleared for at least an hour? Our hero got himself out of that jam and headed back down the highway in the opposite direction, looking for another route to reach his destination. And that's the crux of this book.<br />Finding himself totally lost, not seeing a soul for miles, he pulls into a diner. The  menu includes three deep questions about life that are processed progressively through his conversations in chapter after chapter. Once you get into this book, you won't want to put it down. You'll find yourself on a similar introspective journey of discovery. <br />I could probably write a lot more about the messages in this book, but its best that you read and explore them for yourself. The book is inexpensive; the return on your investment will be rich.	2003-11-28

Most of us know something about the Brazilian Amazon. There is a lot to learn about the Peruvian Amazon, a wholly different environment. This book is another of Dick Lutz's natural history travelogues that mix his experiences on tours with abundant information about the natural and human history of the area he's touring. <br />It's hard to tell if these are pure books about the author's experience or a literary embellishment of the tour company's promotional material and Guidebook for Tour Guides. Readers will learn about the expedition on the tour company's boat-a journal about Our Experiences for the Folks Back Home-and the natural history of this precious rain forest environment. It's a combination of postcards to those who couldn't make the trip and a good high school course or college course in applied biology.<br />This book contains some pictures, with credits to the author's wife and to the tour company, but no explanations of what the pictures are. One gets the feeling of looking at a hastily-assembled scrapbook. If you're interested in what a tour of the Peruvian Amazon might be like, you'll gain some insights from this work.	2003-11-17
US	52870090	RGFULZ1IIU0V8	0968462618	319706549	The Hidden Profit Center	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Cute object lesson	This little book is another of those tales where the CEO is visited and advised by an unlikely character. We've seen a number of books in this genre, probably inspired by Charles Dickens and his ghosts of Christmases Past, Present, and Future. In this case, our CEO is visited by a cleaning lady who, with a flick of her feather-duster, takes him on journeys through his computer screen-a take-off on Alice in Wonderland's looking glass. <br />Stay with me. It gets better. After the unseen CEO observes some money-wasting behavior on the part of his employees, a rabbit appears with one of those old cash registers that made noise when its keys were pressed. This is a \\"five foot white rabbit wearing bright red gloves...This was one cool bunny!\\" OK, we're stretching this a bit far, but remember this book has risen from the ilk of bedtime stories.<br />The bunny calculates the cost of the errant employee behavior and, with a dramatic \\"ca-ching,\\" informs the CEO how much money has been lost-through waste or missed opportunities in the scenario. This pattern is played out each night for a week as our beleaguered CEO gets a wake-up call about how inadequate communication and training is flushing company profits down the drain. <br />A cute tale, though one requiring some open imagination. Points are made and well-summarized at the back of the book. Most executives would benefit from the reminders. The $19.95 price tag seems a bit high for such a small book, but that money could be recovered quickly as the book's lessons are applied. I found that it was easy to anticipate what was coming next and the magic fairy and imagination-stretching bunny were a bit bothersome, the design kept the story light so the messages could be received.<br />This book has some value as a training tool for corporate executives. I could see getting copies for all members of a management team and asking them to read a chapter a night and discuss it over coffee and donuts in the morning. Results would be achieved.	2003-11-16

It feels like a college text. It looks like a college text. It's filled with graphs and charts like a college text. It's seasoned with case studies in call out boxes. There are endnotes, as well as a bibliography. The index is so full of references, a smaller type was used-perhaps to save space.<br />The authors' message is that the secret to developing a creative and effective rewards strategy is based on a combination of Money, Mix, and Message. The Money aspect addresses the value of the reward(s) to the employee. The design of the plan, constructed to meet employer and employee needs, is the Mix. The Message deals with what the employer wants to communicate to its employees about appropriate values and the company's expectations. The authors describe their approach as \\"M3,\\" emphasizing the need for a good balance between the three factors.<br />Readers will explore more than a hundred practical tools for building what they call the M3 Reward System. Financial rewards are integrated with non-financial rewards. Application of the step-by-step strategy promoted by the authors is a CD-ROM that is loaded with tools, exercises, and techniques to equip readers to tailor their own strategies to be consistent with company needs. <br />The authors are consultants with considerable experience in serving dozens of Fortune 500 companies. The orientation of the book, understandably, is toward larger companies. Smaller firms will still get a lot out of this text, but may have to invest some serious study time to get the full benefit of the package. The stories relating the authors' experiences are illuminating and add value for the reader who wants to gain the deeper understanding of how customized corporate reward programs are put together and managed. <br />Hefty price, but fully loaded.	2003-11-03

This is all part of the increasingly rapid globalization of our economy. With different cultures come different rules of engagement. Pardon the pun, but business today is a different world than it was just a short time ago.<br />Hicks, a consultant to companies doing business globally, knows his field. Reading this book is like sitting down for a comfortable living room conversation with an expert. You'll gain a deep appreciation for how global business is different, what to watch for, and what can get in your way. The text is well-illustrated with stories, examples, and insights that will enable readers to substantially increase their chances of success on the international playing field. <br />You'll learn about cross-cultural behaviors that will undoubtedly open your eyes. The knowledge about cross-cultural business skills, negotiation, sales, and customer service will put you strategically ahead of the competition.  Hick addresses how to make global alliances work and how to deal with gender issues. The downside is covered, too, so you'll know about vital issues about bribery, corruption, and legal issues. The question of dangerous destinations is particularly valuable in today's volatile world.<br />This is the kind of book that will hold your attention as you begin. You'll want to keep reading, which can interrupt your productivity. Don't try to read Global Deals at work. This one is best absorbed in the curl-up-in-the-comfy-chair kind of reading.  The stories will draw you in; you'll be surprised how much you're learning. <br />A bibliography and index add to the book's value, enabling you to use the book efficiently for reference later. Suggestion: after you've read this book, invite your colleagues to read it, too, strengthening your company's capacity to do business in the most effective way on the global stage.	2003-11-03
US	52870090	R20ONDVJIR0UI0	0873379306	315195021	Marketing Without Advertising: Inspire Customers to Rave About Your Business to Create Lasting Success, Fourth Edition	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Comprehensive and Up-to-Date	The authors begin the fourth edition of their book with a declarative statement: \\"Marketing means running a first-rate business and letting people know about it. Every action your company takes sends a marketing message.\\" Clever ads, the authors suggest, are a waste of resources. Advertising is not effective for business building, customers lured by ads are fickle, and there are better ways to invest resources for business building. That said (Chapter 1: Advertising: The Last Choice in Marketing), the authors proceed to give us a comprehensive, practical, in-depth journey through a wide range of marketing strategies. <br />Topics covered include the physical appearance of your business, pricing, people treatment, openness and trust, educating prospective customers, demonstrating expertise, helping customers find you, dynamic interactive marketing, and use of the internet. A valuable section of this book deals with designing and implementing a marketing plan, the all-important work of organizing your strategy. <br />An appendix includes recommended reading, how to contact the authors for consulting help, and 21 worksheets to help you evaluate how you're doing. Good index. This book covers a lot of information-strategies and techniques-that will be valuable to any small or mid-sized business. I mention this broad-base value since the book is published by a firm that specializes in law books. Obviously, there's great value to law firms in these pages, but readers should not expect the book to be exclusive. In fact, the chapter on Creating a Calendar of Events uses examples of an interior design firm and a chiropractic clinic. Questionnaires and call-out boxes throughout the book help readers get the message and understand it.<br />The only negative I would share, which is minor, is the unusual page numbering system. Instead of starting with page 1 and continuing, as most books do, this book numbers the pages by chapters. Example 9/15, indicating the 15th page in chapter 9. <br />Useful as a read-through and as a reference book. A worthwhile read for anyone seeking to build a business without dumping a ton of money into advertising that won't produce a return.	2003-11-02

Organizations that deliver outstanding customer service as an integral part of their business operation build customer loyalty and bottom line strength. Those that don't...well, we all know that bad customer service can destroy a company, or at least severely limit its potential.<br />This knowledge is legendary. Techniques for delivering good customer service are well-known. This is not brain surgery. Why another book on the ubiquitous topic?<br />First, note the title. The book title doesn't talk about Excellent Customer Service or You Will  Be Fired if You Aren't Nice to Our Customers. The Unleashing Excellence title-and theme of the book-is directed toward senior executives. Customer service is a corporate strategy that needs to be led from the top. This book needs to be read by senior executives that allege that they don't have time to read it. The downside of mediocre customer service can be career-limiting to executives who don't pay attention to this critical component of their company's business.<br />The authors, both formerly part of the Walt Disney leadership development programs, are now in private practice. They are active consultants-to a wide range of employers-on customer service issues. In their work, they apply what they learned at Disney and other employment experiences to deliver an executive-targeted message. Toward this end, the book is easy to read, includes shaded call-out boxes, Action Steps and Pitfalls to Avoid at the end of each chapter. The book's concluding chapter presents nine leadership actions to guide readers in strengthening their customer service delivery. A comprehensive index makes the book even more reader-friendly. <br />Readers will benefit from a continual flow of best practice stories from many employment settings. Many of the examples of good work come from the authors' clients. These illustrations serve to enhance and illuminate the content to bring the traditional concepts to life in ways that leaders can read the book and initiate appropriate actions for individual and organizational improvement. Several sections of the book stand out in my mind, but all chapters are filled with ideas, thought-provoking discussions, and anecdotes to bring the concepts to life.<br />Yes (sigh), this is ANOTHER customer service book. Do we need more books on this topic? Some of us are beginning to feel overstuffed with this topic---like the bloated feeling we get after a huge Thanksgiving dinner. Thankfully, this book serves a specific purpose of providing how-to advice and insights for executives and managers to consider and implement. Use it as a tool to stimulate customer service conversations in your organization as you inspire increasingly high attention to incredible customer service as a part of your corporate DNA.	2003-11-01

We also hear about young men and women dying during military basic training, in senseless automobile accidents, and from their involvement in various unlawful activities. The negative stories get the public exposure...and persist. <br />How much do we hear about therapeutic wilderness programs that have turned youth around, literally saved their lives? How many stories do we see in the papers about the thousands of fine men and women who complete military basic training with pride and perform so well protecting our country? A very small percentage of students are ever involved in automobile accidents or unlawful activity.<br />There is good news, and we need to listen and spread the word. Gary Ferguson heard about the powerful work done by Aspen Achievement Academy, a highly reputed outdoor program designed to turn around troubled youth. Based in Loa, Utah, several hours south of Salt Lake City, the Academy runs a program that reaches deep inside the young men and women who are sent there--often against their will. These troubled teens have acted out their anger and confusion by doing drugs or alcohol, harming others or themselves, and engaging in other extremely anti-social behaviors. They are sent to Loa by parents at the end of their rope, therapists and counselors, and sometimes legal situations. They don't want to go, yet they are transformed in spite of their initial resistance. A couple of months in the desert and the woods, under the close supervision of trained counselors who care about them produces incredible turnaround results. <br />The young people experience a wide range of insights, surrounded by caring and loving people whose job it is to keep them safe and give them an environment where they can find themselves and grow. Curious, and perhaps a bit suspicions, nature writer Gary Ferguson made arrangements to become trained as a counselor and experience what the teens--and their staff support people--go through every day.<br />Shouting at the Sky is a beautifully crafted story about journeys. Spending time with a girls' group and a boys' group, Ferguson observes, listens, participates, and creates a moving journal of the experience. Readers will share the life-changing shifts of troubled teens, the dedication and stress of staff, and Ferguson's personal transformation as he is influenced by troubled youth practically fighting for their lives.<br />The nature writer comes out-in the flowerly language that feeds the reader's imagination--and in the appreciation of the environments in which the young people function. Sometimes the depth of the writer's ability to use the English language to paint pictures gets in the way of the message, but the message burns its way through. Ferguson learned about human nature in the weeks that he actually spent with the youth and the staff counselors. <br />The stories are often gripping, moving, and heart-warming. I was inspired to keep reading, didn't want to put the book down. If you have children who might be described as troubled youth, read this book. If you're a teacher, counselor, or therapist working with youth, read this book. Having spent some time in Loa learning more about Aspen Achievement Academy, I can tell you that this book is accurate and well worth the read.	2003-10-30

We need men and women who can lead us out of the darkness of despair and short-term Wall Street thinking into the clear air of vision, goals, and high achievement. Enter the narcissistic leader. Narcissists admire themselves, they believe in themselves. They have complete confidence in themselves, even though they may think they can do more than they really can. <br />The dictionary tells us that narcissism is \\"a psychological condition characterized by self-preoccupation, lack of empathy, and unconscious deficits in self-esteem.\\" Maccoby-a psychoanalyst, anthropologist, and consultant-takes us further. He explains that \\"narcissistic leaders are not a product of their time; rather, they are a product of their personalities, and are psychologically suited to rise, and fall, during disruptive times.\\" Sometimes their grandiosity serves them-and their organizations-well...especially if they (or their organizations) are protected by counterbalancing aides or confidants. Sometimes that grandiosity can be their downfall.<br />In this enjoyable and education book, Maccoby describes several psychological styles and how they influence leadership behavior. He concentrates on the productive narcissist, results-focused aggressive leaders who can valiantly lead their organizations to the brink of destruction. The good news---bad news juxtaposition is explored in page after page, with enlightening examples from the lives of historical figures like Napoleon to today's leaders whom we read about in the newspapers daily. Not only does he name names, but Maccoby goes deep into who these leaders are, what they did, why they did it, and the impacts of their behavior. It's a fascinating read that will have you bobbing your head with understanding and insight. <br />This book will be valuable to leaders-and not just narcissists. Human resource professionals, executive coaches, and venture capitalists willfind the knowledge in these pages to be quite useful. A self-test, with full explanation of scoring and meaning, adds value to the book. Index.	2003-10-19

A wide range of conversations, methods of feedback delivery, and relationships have been accepted as coaching in a rather loose collection of techniques...and results. As we move into an increasingly challenging period for employers, leaders must become substantially more effective at this process we describe as coaching. A whole new generation of leaders must be taught, coached, and brought to a higher level of performance.<br />Bacon and Spears, experienced in coaching more than 2,000 individual clients in Fortune 500 companies, share their knowledge and experience. Their researched-based approach emphasizes the skills needed by coaches and that coaching styles must be adapted to what the client needs. The eight styles they identify are directive (teacher, parent, manager, philosopher) and non-directive (facilitator, counselor, colleague, mentor). This model alone will expand, deepen, and enrich the work done by the vast majority of coaches in the corporate world.<br />The book offers even more, delivering checklists, assessment tools, tips and tools, and a wealth of sample coach-client dialogues. Recognizing the special opportunities the future will hold, the authors include insights into coaching across cultures, across generations, as well as coaching women, minorities, and C-level executives.<br />An epilogue with even more perspectives adds value to this volume, as do the reference section and comprehensive index. This is not a book for readers who simply want to gain a few insights into improving their coaching effectiveness. You'll learn, but you'll be overwhelmed. Adaptive Coaching is like a college textbook on the topic. It's a heavy, deep, and thorough treatment with relatively small type. The $39.95 price suggests that this is more than the average airplane reading management book...and it is. If you're serious about the criticaland fine art of coaching in the complicated corporate environment, you'll gain considerable knowledge, insight, and growth from this book.<br />Side note: I am the author of Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People. As a workforce futurist, I see what's coming... including a dangerous dearth of leadership. Application of the principles in this book will help today's leaders strengthen each other and the next generation of leaders.	2003-10-12

Thousands upon thousands of people have been laid off, down-sized, mis-employed, under-employed. Recent surveys suggest that 30-40 percent of those who are employed are dissatisfied and looking for something better. What is better? It's more than just money.  <br />As we sit on the threshold of another wide open labor market, filled with bountiful opportunities for exciting career development, this is the time to take a deep breath and determine where you really want to go with your work life.

In addition to other significant positions, Dowd served as director of Career Services at the Darden Graduate Business School of the University of Virginia and Taguchi served as director of the Stanford MBA Career Management Center. These backgrounds tell you that this book will be most valuable for educated professionals, though there is plenty of content to be helpful to less educated workers or those on the way up. <br /> <br />The book is organized in a comfortable, easy-to-use format. First the authors help readers understand their history-what brought them to where they are today. If you're like most people, the past hasn't always been pretty. Understood. Dowd and Taguchi put the good, the bad, and the ugly into perspective as they focus you toward the future. In the second section of the book, you'll gain some deep understandings of who you are now-what drives you, what's important to you. With this foundation in place, the authors take you into your future career, building your confidence along the way. <br /> <br />This bookis not light, fun reading. You'll sit down with a serious how-to textbook that will take you through a tour of the career design and management process that will exceed anything you've done before. There's some deep stuff in these pages that make this book worth far more than the $14.95 list price. <br /> <br />As if the text weren't enough, you'll benefit from five appendices, notes, and an index. Lots of tips on websites, writing resumes and cover letters, opportunity evaluation guides, and compensation negotiation tips. Anecdotes, case studies, exercises, and exercises add even more. If you are analyzing where you want to go next in your business or professional career, invest some time with this book. If your work includes advising others on their careers, this book, dog-eared, belongs on your reference shelf.<br />Note: I am lead author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People\\" and a workforce futurist.

Some have been around for a long time, reissued on a regular basis. Others are new, but deliver the same wisdom in a new package. <br />Brian Tracy is internationally known for his work as a motivational speaker and sales trainer. He has earned the respect of his colleagues because of his ability to translate the ancient wisdom and obvious truths into forms that help his customers build better lives for themselves. His speeches, seminars, books, tapes, training packages, and more have enabled thousands and thousands of people to improve their lot in life. <br />This book delivers that proven wisdom-and some thought-provoking ideas-in a short-burst format. Readers will find a lot of old material here-seasoned material handed down through the ages. Before you discount it, remember that we all forget that advice-no matter how simple or obvious-that we don't review frequently. A spin through this book will stimulate some old memories that may inspire you to do something new and different to make some changes in your life. <br />Don't expect the lightning bolt of dramatically new material. It's not here...and you probably don't need it. You still have plenty of room to grow from application of the advice you've heard before but haven't acted on. <br />This is the kind of book that makes great reading for the airplane or the bathroom. Short explanations-easy to read a little, then put the book down to pick up again later. Why not put it on your bedside table to read-and think about-one piece of wisdom as you drift off to sleep.<br />There are exercises in the book to guide you in some applications, but you can create these practice sessions on your own. Accept this book as a compilation of well-known stories, advice, and inspirational vignettes and apply the content in your own life. Reading Brian Tracy's latest will not change your life. Applying what you read, however, could have a profound effect.<br />My rating is based on this book providing a good collection of nuggets of wisdom, not on any expectation that the book would be something new and different. If you feel you could benefit from a good dose of the insight that's helped thousands of people through the ages, this book will meet that need.	2003-10-12

If they are not connected with their employer, people will leave the organization to seek employment opportunities where they can be more engaged. Anything and everything a company can do to relate more closely with the people who matter will make a difference. <br />An experienced corporate communicator, Holtz emphasizes that internal communication in a company is much more than just publishing a newsletter or magazine for employees. The behaviors communicators influence are \\"the ones that would support the company bottom-line business efforts.\\"  There's more to this process than reporting birthdays, babies, brides, and bowling scores. Employees must be reached with compelling, understandable, and credible messages that are easy to access, grasp, and absorb. <br />This easy-to-read handbook explores a number of facets of employee communications. Readers will learn about the types of communications, planning, and traditional communication tools. More modern approaches of online communication are discussed, along with insights into the sustainability of the communication process. Holtz devotes chapters to special situations such as communicating bad news, and change. Chapters on organizing and budgeting, as well as measuring the value of communication, provide some professional tools that will be useful to the reader. <br />The value of the book is enhanced by appendices on messaging policies and resources, as well as a good index. The text, written in a relatively conversational style, is seasoned with case studies from two fictitious companies-one that does communication right, and one that misses the mark. The book is current and is designed with enough white space to make it comfortable to read and benefit from.<br />While I might have organized the chapters a bit differently, that's an easy task for a wise reader to accomplish.

If brokers are not well- trained in how to serve their clients and/or theyre more focused on lining their pockets rather than their clients pockets, investors can lose their shirtsand then some. When their world crashes around them, these troubled people go to professionals like Daniel Solin. <br />During this painful time, investors learn what they should have known long before. Sometimes they can recoup some of their losses, sometimes not. Understanding the playing field before suiting up means a considerably better chance at winning the game (or at least playing well). Solin teaches readersin page after high content pagewhat brokers do to damage their clients. Unconditional trust in your broker may not be the wisest move. The potential for fraud is rampant. Youll learn about churning, frontrunning, unauthorized trading, and a host of other malpractices that create risks beyond the market itself for the unwitting investor. <br />Solin  is a trial attorney with over three decades of experience. He has recovered millions of dollars for investors who have been mistreated by brokerseven those employed by well-known and respected brokerage firms. He doesnt always win, so readers should not get the idea that Solin is some sort of guardian angel.

Warning: this book is not for the faint (or feint) of heart.<br />Cheryl (after reading this book, you'll feel like you're sitting in her kitchen, so we'll go with first-name basis) wrote this book for women, but a few men will find it valuable. Cheryl would suggest, however, that most men won't understand it because, you see, we're clueless. Yes, I'm a man. My wife gave me this book to read, suggesting that a book reviewer like me might find it interesting. Oh, boy.<br />To sum up Cheryl's philosophy, men are dolts. Well, she didn't use that particular word, but she employed a wide range of synonyms. We don't know how to be husbands, lovers, fathers, or any of those things. We have to be trained, led, managed by a capable woman. The capable part comes from knowing yourself-loving yourself-before looking outside. Women get so many messages that diminish them, self-love and strength is vital. <BR>Every woman who has been birthed and raised by another woman, passing mental and psychological garbage down through the ages needs to read-no, absorb-this book. Put it under your pillow after bedtime reading and hope for osmosis.<br />Now, men. Read this book. Reality: It will only help a little bit in understanding your woman. You won't get as much out of it as a woman will, but if you pay attention you will cower and love with a slightly higher level of effectiveness. My wife insists that I am not clueless, though over dinner tonight she did admit that I used to be. Now I'm a step beyond clueless (and I am like the handsome, wonderful man Cheryl has been married to for 23 roller-coaster years): I'm trainable...and receptive. The rewards are worth the struggle. Be sure to check out page 149 for the list of lessons we can learn from the unconditional love of dogs. <br />There is no index. You don't need one. But you will find value from the bibliography and the rich collection of resources in the back of the book. This is a wonderful recovery guide for misguided women, confused men, and relationships that can benefit from the nurturing that comes from real love.	2003-10-07

His followers enjoy a style of writing that is comfortable, easy to relate to, and complete with concepts to engage the mind. Five years ago, while a Resident Fellow at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at Harvard University, he began writing a monthly column on ethics for the New York Times. This opportunity was a natural for Seglin, whose writing and objective observations benefit from a foundation of deep thinking about vital business issues. <br />This book is a collection of 46 of the columns Seglin wrote in the Times. Rather than a chronological sequence, the presentation is organized into six parts: Ethics Policies and Life in the Corporation; Hiring; Bosses; Privacy: Lying, Cheating, and Stealing; and Leading by Example. The columns are presented like a series of essays, one \\"chapter\\"  following another without starting on a new page. This design gives the reader a sense of flow, that all these issues addressed by Seglin are tied together. <br />Readers will read thought-provoking pieces on a wide variety of topics, each of which could stimulate worthwhile conversations among corporate executives. The purpose of the essays is to raise ethical questions that people in business were likely to face. Discussion of the issues presented-by corporate executives, managers, and virtually every member of an organization-can build a productive openness and a process for dealing with situations that arise. The exploration of these issues, dilemmas, and implications will be valuable for university students about to enter the business world... especially those who desire to move into leadership positions where they may confront ethical considerations on a fairly regular basis-to resolve, advise, or mediate. <br />There are no black-or-white answers in this book. Seglin is careful to point out that \\"The discussion of ethics in business is one that at its best should be ongoing and always challenging assumptions.\\" This book will be a useful tool to foster those health discussions.	2003-10-05

Storytelling has been used to convey history and lessons for centuries. Before newspapers came on the scene, story tellers would travel from village to village telling stories to share the news of what was happening in other communities and the world at large...at least as large as it was back then. One could argue that storytelling has become almost a lost art as our communication mode has shifted more to content, facts, polices and procedures. In the corporate world, leaders and managers-and training professionals-have attempted to communicate without really reaching people \\"inside,\\" where messages can resonate with a mental or emotional picture. It's that inner connection that has the potential of changing behavior and making a difference. To make that connection, communicators need to engage people's minds and hearts to help them \\"get\\" the message.<br />So here's a book on the stories trainers tell. Big book, thick. Whew! That's a lot of fluffy, touchy-feely soft stuff! That first impression will disintegrate as you open this wonderful resource.  Sure, there's a treasure chest of stories, mostly from experienced trainers and professional speakers who use them regularly to build the effectiveness of their work. If this book were merely a collection of all those stories, it would be a helpful reference...sort of a Chicken Soup for the Trainer's Bookshelf. Fortunately, the authors have a deeper understanding of what communicators need, so they created an incredible tool kit for trainers, speakers, executives, managers, coaches, parents-the list goes on.<br />Each of the stories is presented with tips on how to use it, questions to enrich the telling, key point options, and follow-up activities. The stories-short, not long-are set apart in the text by the use of helpful shading. So, now we have more value than just a catalog of stories. But, wait! There's more. The book includes an explanation of different kinds of stories, when and how they can be used, with a cross-reference to the 55 stories. Want even more value? The stories are gathered into chapters that organize the resources for easier access: Appreciating Differences, Communications and Feedback, Customer Service, Influence and Motivation, Leadership, Living Our Values, Performance and Coaching, Problem Solving, Teamwork and Collaboration, and Training Fundamentals.<br />Are you sensing why I'm enthusiastic about this book? We're not done! I've only told you about what's in the back of the book! \\"Stories Trainers Tell\\" begins with an invaluable section on the why and how of using stories to enhance and enrich communication. Page after page of tips and insight educates and inspires the reader, deepening understanding to raise the level of professionalism and effectiveness in communication.<br />The CD-ROM? Pop this tool into your computer and enjoy an MP3 format delivery of audio dramatizations of the stories in the book. Readers can now learn as listeners also, and most of the recordings are authorized for replay to audiences. Playing a recording of someone else telling a story, then facilitating the interpretation and application of what was heard offers a new dimension to the richness of communication, thought stimulation, and movement to action.<br />Then there's the reading list and the index. So much! You'll be captivated with a cover-to-cover read, entranced by the stories yourself. This book will sit prominently on your shelf as a primary resource for years to come. I half-apologize for the long review, but this book deserves the accolades.	2003-10-01

The opportunity to learn from someone who built a strong enough business to sell to the legendary Warren Buffett would be particularly valuable. This book offers that coveted opportunity.<br />The author did not build his business all by himself. His father and grandfather preceded him in building the three-generation family business of 143 retail jewelry stores in 23 states. A well-led executive team made it all work beautifully. Helzberg Diamonds set the standard for customer service, earning the loyalty of thousands of customers who contributed to the success of the enterprise.<br />Helzberg starts his book by telling us that he's a plagiarist. He's collected ideas from many other people, used them to grow his business, and shares them in page after page of philosophy and advice. The book is organized into six sections: Managing, Decision Making, Hiring, Inspiring, Communicating, and Focusing. Each section is a collection of short chapters that deliver this effective CEO's secrets, illustrated with examples from what he and his company accomplished. Each chapter's advice is complemented by a sidebar entitled \\"Mining for Diamonds\\"-pithy statements that provide powerful guidance for any business leader. Quotes from a wide range of gurus, mentors, and leaders, offer an additional dose of thought-provoking and inspiring words.<br />The book is easy for busy entrepreneurs to read. The chapters are short enough to absorb during a break-coffee, bathroom, or deep breath-and tightly written enough so you can glean the concepts quickly. A list of recommended readings and an index add value to the volume. The only feature that might have improved this treasure would be a complete listing in one place of all Helzberg's \\"Mining for Diamonds\\" advice. Too bad, you'll have to go through the book chapter by chapterto mine those gems for yourself. The experience will be worthwhile...and probably repeated a few times to gain the full impact of this down-to-earth, almost homespun, recipe book for entrepreneurial success.	2003-09-28

In pounds, it is lightweight (good to stick in your briefcase for that next airplane trip). In content, it's heavyweight. <br />The premise of this book is that leaders send their messages, inspire their followers, and achieve results by using a particular type of language. The secret is astonishingly simple: tell stories, strategic stories. The key is to share a vision that people can buy into and they'll follow you to the ends of the Earth.<br />This disarmingly short book provides the insight into the technique, explains how this approach works, shows you how to use it, and encourages you to use the system. It seems so easy...one of those things that's right there in front of us, but we never saw it. Walton, a former CNN journalist, reports what he's learned, citing examples from the strategies of well-known executives. <br />Readers will benefit from clear explanations, how-to advice, and a sort of combination of enlightenment and inspiration. This book will stimulate your thinking and change the way you communicate. The illustrations, a glossary, and index provide added value.	2003-09-25

Their livelihoods depend on their personal success.  More than any other occupational group, salespeople will invest in themselves, strive for self-development, and seek opportunities to sit at the feet of the gurus in the field.<br />Jeffrey Gitomer is recognized as a guru in the field of sales and sales training. He unabashedly proclaims himself to be the \\"best sales trainer in the world.\\" While there are probably a few people who would dispute that assertion, Gitomer said it so others have to go on the offensive to attempt to refute his claim. This high level of confidence and firm emphasis on action and self-improvement are part of the author's character...and part of this book. The presentation is as strong and direct as you might expect from someone who learned how to sell in the highly competitive environment of New York and New Jersey.<br />Salespeople reading this book, neophytes and seasoned professionals, will gain ideas, insights, and reminders on practically every page. It is hard to miss the points: they're shot at the reader, zinger after zinger. Short chapter after short chapter. Large print headlines grabbing your attention. Fast-moving, like Gitomer's popular seminars (he'll tell you that himself!) held around the country. <br />The point: successful salespeople are incredibly busy. They have precious little patience for fluff and usually don't have the time to sit down and read long chapters. Life is USA Today bite-sized pieces. The Sales Bible delivers just that way. The book designer did a fine job of capturing just the flavor needed to reach the intended audience. Financial officers will be uncomfortable with the book, but who cares! It's not written for financial officers...unless they're selling.<br />The Sales Bible is similar to the more familiar Holy Bible, which has sold just a few more copies than this book probably will. It's organized into Books. Genesis is here, but only to lead the reader into The Book of Rules, The Book of Secrets, The Book of WOW, The Book of Cold Calling, the Book of Exhibitions. You get the idea. Read it straight through or pick the sections you want to concentrate on-during first or subsequent readings. The Table of contents is well-organized, with depth, to help readers find what they want and \\"get\\" the message, and the comprehensive index adds to that value. <br />Expect to carry this book with you and refer to it often...like when you're sitting in that traffic jam. How many copies do you need? Home, office, car? This is a book you could wear out quickly. I can see sales managers starting each day with Bible readings....     This review refers to the trade paperback edition.	2003-09-16

Being positively unique has even more value. Leading your category in the marketplace builds business through the image of that coveted Number One status. Being so unique and so powerful that you're in a category all by yourself is the ultimate achievement. That positioning sets you apart from all would-be competitors because you're something pretty special...and people like to do business with suppliers that are something pretty special. If you want to achieve superlative success, your goal should be to become a Category of One. <br />First step: Read Joe Calloway's book.  Second step: Read it again. Why? You'll be so entranced on the first reading that you'll miss a significant amount of valuable advice. Step Three: Start applying what you've learned from this book. Step Four: Read the book again, going back to all those passages you highlighted. Oh, along the way, better buy copies for all your key people so they can also get the message. [Snicker. After reading this book, you may have difficulty limiting who fits in that vital category of \\"key people.\\"<br />Calloway is a management consultant who specializes in branding and competitive positioning. Through his client interactions over the years, and his own personal experiences, he's accumulated a wealth of information and insight. He knows how to be so good that your would-be competitors can't even touch you. In a surprising self-effacing gesture, rarely seen from consultants, Calloway shares in the preface that he's not the expert; he's merely a reporter. I have difficulty believing that he doesn't have expertise, but he sure does a fine job of reporting what winning companies are doing. <br />Each chapter is filled with advice, anecdotes, and inspiration. Very quickly, readers will \\"get\\" the difference between organizations that are so good that they create their own category...whether they intend to or not. As you learn why, you'll become motivated to make some changes in the way you do business. You'll discover what branding really means. You'll appreciate the power of being close to the customer. And you'll gain a deep understanding of how people can make the difference-if their leaders inculcate the values and drive for consistency that must be energized to be a Category of One employer.<br />Note: while this book is intended for employers-owners, executives, manager, and everyone else on the team, there is also value for the individual who wants to make himself/herself highly attractive. Looking for the perfect job for you? Looking for the perfect mate? This book is not the end-all, but the principles Calloway teaches have wide application. Open your mind and open your wallet. This is a book worth buying, reading, absorbing, and applying.	2003-09-07

And wouldn't it be nice to have a friend as a marriage counselor? Everyone is who is married-happily or aspiring to be happy-needs to continually examine and reinforce all those wonderful positive reasons you chose your mate...and chose to stay with your mate for all those days, months, years, decades...lifetimes. Marriage isn't easy or perfect. It's a special relationship that you have to work hard to make work. <br />OK, so how do you make a marriage work? Well, first you shatter all the myths about skipping down the daisy-lined paths along the white picket fence. Life isn't like what we see in some of those movies and television shows that make it all seem so easy. Barbara knows. She's been there, done that...and shares her life in personal disclosures that are comfortable and instructive. Readers will feel that they are building a friendship with this author, sitting over a cup of coffee-or herbal tea-at the table in cozy breakfast nook. <br />Barbara (we're feeling that first-name comfort now) will tell you what works and what doesn't. Her life and experience as a therapist, combined with her work as a consultant and professional speaker, will enable her to really get her points across in ways that we can understand, relate to, and put to work. <br />Challenges in your marriage? Lay `em out. Is the commitment really there? Can I count on you? I married you because you were perfect; now change! You're just like your father, mother, brother, sister, etc. Why don't we do things together?  Money, intimacy, kids. Just about everything you can imagine will bubble to the surface in these pages. You'll read the myths and the realities. Stories, case studies, tools and end-of- chapter quizzes enhance the value of this book. No index: doesn't need one, but there is a helpful section of resources at the end of the book. <br />You'll learn. You'll laugh. You'll shake your head and nod your head. You'll read sections to your spouse. And, as you share the concepts of this book, your marriage will become even stronger. Extra note for business owners, executives, and managers, many of the things you read just might have some application for a different kind of marriage: the relationship between employer and employee. <br />Warning: Don't expect to read this book at one sitting. There's too much content to absorb that quickly. Besides, because you'll want to share with others too frequently, your reading will be constantly interrupted!	2003-09-06

While tremendous opportunities are placed before us, we are also surrounded (and influenced) by unparalleled uncertainty. Practically everything in our lives seems fraught with risk. Is this the right thing to do? Is this the right time? Questions! Questions!<br />Wouldn't it be nice to get some solid advice from a risk taker who knows what he's talking about? Bill Treasurer understands risk--from a variety of perspectives. He's a consultant-who formed his practice during a weak economy. Risk. Prior to that, he was a corporate executive with income in the six-figure range, yet he took the big leap of going into business for himself. From 1984-1991 he traveled the world as a member of the United States High Diving Team, performing some 1500 dives from heights over 100 feet (think ten story building). For years, he was also known as the fire-diving superhero, Captain Inferno. He dove dressed in a costume with a cape drenched in gasoline. With the strike of a match, he was transformed into a flying human torch. Risk.<br />You don't have to leap from tall buildings to take risks. They're all around us. The key, Treasurer asserts, is taking the right risks at the right time for the right reasons. His ten principles about risk taking, each presented in a separate chapter, guide readers through a process of evaluating the risks, obstacles, and the process to overcome fear and doubt in the right way. Each chapter presents one of Treasurer's principles, illustrated with anecdotes  from his life and risk-taking experiences of others. Good stuff--highly readable, educational and thought-provoking. Each of the principle chapters concludes with a set of questions to stimulate additional thinking and assessment. <br />The closing statements of the book-the final chapter-emphasize the critical importance of being authentic. Kidding yourself is the biggest risk of all. Treasurer shares some valuable philosophies that put risk and its ramifications into perspective. <br />The book includes a good notes section and a surprisingly comprehensive index. As you consider all the risks that lie in your path-in work, your personal life, family endeavors, and so much more, the advice in this book will serve you well.	2003-09-01

It's possible-and practical for the right kinds of people. <br />To learn if this is right for you, it's wise to do some exploring-into what others have done. Bonnie and Michael, husband and wife, took the Big Leap. Most of the year they spent together, but they did separate for a while to pursue their own needs, their own dreams. Their time was spent volunteering, sightseeing, learning, and renewing. This book tells their story-the good, the bad, and the ugly.

I'll also go out on a limb and assert that it's one of the best books I've seen published by AMACOM. With those superlatives in place, let's look at the book.<br />The challenge of market positioning, business-to-consumer and business-to-business, has intensified. Buyers' minds have become crowded-no, cluttered-with a bombardment of messages urging them to select one product or service over another. Organizations that desire to positively influence people about their offerings must be concerned about brand. And \\"organizations\\" encompasses more than just manufacturers, retailers, and other for-profits. Not-for-profits, schools, civic groups, causes, and even individuals need to pay more attention to developing, enhancing, and defending their brands.<br />This high-content book is written for beginners as well as those who think they know at least something about what they're doing. In chapter after chapter, \\"Brand Aid\\" delivers critical knowledge that is both educational and though-provoking. The chapters conclude with sets of questions to help readers measure just how well they're doing...and what needs to be done. No matter how good you think you are, you will find reinforcement and unsettling feelings for work to be done in each of these check-off lists. \\"Did You Know\\" inset boxes throughout the book provide interesting facts, case studies, and other material to effectively supplement the primary text. The three appendices deliver even more knowledge...and challenging questions. <br />As I read this book, I felt like I was taking a college course-maybe a graduate course-in branding. I found myself wanting to talk with the professor to explore even further than the depth I was experiencing. The style of the book is quite engaging and will certainly hold the interest of people in the field. I'd recommend it as well for business owners and executives who may not be directly involved with branding; indirectly, you are a part of the process, and gleaning the messages and insights in this book will enable you to serve as a much more effective leader.<br />The comprehensive index and the book's website make \\"Brand Aid\\" even more useful. A glimpse of the cover and acknowledgement of what comes immediately to mind will stimulate your thinking, then turning the pages will start you on an exciting adventure. You'll be motivated to take action from practically every chapter, so get ready for an application-oriented reading experience. Great as a read-through and as a reference book.	2003-08-08

There's a movement afoot to raise the societal and parental consciousness about a \\"special\\" group of children known as Indigos. The writings in the field suggest that they're significantly different than other children of their generation-the children of today. I suspect that those kids that we identify as \\"Indigo\\" are but the leading edge of an entire generation of such people...which makes every book on this topic substantially more meaningful. Books on this topic-including this one-should be required reading for university students preparing to be teachers and counselors, let alone those who are practicing in the field already. <br />Chapter One of this book explains the terminology, so you don't have to scurry around looking for references to understand the perspectives. Nevertheless, I'd recommend you read \\"The Indigo Children\\" by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober and \\"The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children\\" by Doreen Virtue. Their work will give you deep insight into Indigos, while this book focuses on anger management issues and techniques and their relationship to Indigo children...and others. <br />At first, scanning the table of contents, I suspected this was the work of an anger therapist or seminar leader looking for another place to promote her work. Part of this attitude on my part came from seeing the trademark indicator on several of Lancaster's theories and approaches. As I read the book, I came to realize that the trademarks show that this professional has done some fine, groundbreaking work that is worthy of respect and recognition. There's a tremendous amount of good content in this volume.<br />Chapter Three caught my attention: 44 Ways to Show Kids You Care. There's a whole book right there, I pondered. And, sure enough, there is a great deal of advice in those pages. Thinking of how I'd applied the principles with my own children, I patted myself on the back reading a few of them-emphasis on the word \\"few.\\" Every parent should have this list on a laminated card within easy reach.<br />The book continues with the same value, chapter after chapter. Not every word is an original thought of Dianne Lancaster. She brings in chapters written by others or tapping into the work of others. This technique makes two statements to me: first, Lancaster realizes she doesn't have all the answers (bravo!), and second, she knows who does have answers and invests an extra effort to be sure the reader gains maximum benefit from her book. <br />I will admit that there are parts of this book, like the chapter on symbology, that stretched credibility for me. You should know that I'm fairly well hard-wired to solid knowledge and some of the approaches in this field push the edges of my envelope. What does this mean to you?

Fun and Effective Business Training Techniques from the Worlds of State, Screen, and Song. Wow! An 8.5 X 11 trade paperback. Thick. I'll bet this volume is packed full of great ideas-lots of how-tos to add pizzazz to training programs. <br />What I got was page after page after page of theory, show biz history, anecdotes, and the author's cartoons. I was almost 130 pages into this book before I found something that looked like useful techniques. See what you think: <br />\\"Face Off. The action: Learners pair off and face each other. The learners turn away from each other briefly. On the instructor's signal, they turn back around and make funny faces at each other. The task repeats three times. Suggested Use: introductions, reenergizing activity. Parameters: May be used in other contexts by directing the type of faces learners should make: angry faces for customer complaints or conflict resolution.\\" Page 127 <br />Am I missing something here? Wait till you get to the section on microphones that begins on page 311. It's well written for someone who's never seen a mike before. Experienced trainers, who might be interested in a well-done book with this title, will feel talked down to. With the author's background as an instructional designer and \\"former Disney University and Disney Institute employee\\" (doing...?), I expected more. <br />For people who are new to the field of education and training or studying the field in school, this book has some value. If you're interested in a lot of learning theory, this book has something to offer. If you're a professional trainer looking to gain a lot of new techniques from a strong how-to book, this isn't it.

Or, put another way, innovate or stand helplessly and watch your competitors eat your lunch! Wise leaders stimulate, encourage, reinforce, and reward innovation. If you're not doing this in your organization, now is the time to start...and this book will show you the path.<br />The book is organized into three parts: The Seeds of Creative Thinking, The Seeds of Strategic Thinking, and The Seeds of Transformational Thinking. Dundon, a consultant and speaker on innovation, takes us out of the proverbial box. The process starts with an introductory chapter that delivers an introduction to innovation management. In this presentation, the author sets the stage nicely for the value of the balance of the book.<br />Each aspect of thinking is essential to making a difference in an organization. Dundon explains the what, the why, the how, and provides examples in a very instructive text. Each chapter addresses skills and strategies to generate creativity, a strategic approach (big picture and visionary), and practical how-to ideas to support innovation in organizational settings. Reading the chapters alone is worthwhile, but we're not done yet. Following the eleven chapters are five appendices, a recommended reading list, and an index. <br />The appendices provide an explanation of the nine step innovation process, a list of probing questions to energize innovative thinking, 99 innovations and 99 trends. Readers will find it valuable to go through the list of trends and consider their influence on how their organization does business...and will do business in the future. As a futurist by profession, I can vouch for this being a comprehensive and highly usable list. The additional criteria section, while not too long, offers even more thought-provoking insights to check your work, stimulate more discussion, and refine the product of your synergistic thinking. <br />Readers will find this book valuable as a cover-to-cover read, but then highly effective as a tool to achieve significant results.	2003-07-13

There are PhDs and there are PhDs. When you see a book by a retired Air Force major general who has a PhD, you pay attention. Maybe there will be something interesting here. Indeed!<br />In fifteen chapters, Cohen covers a wide range of leadership topics. Understandably, there's a lot of the military model here, but it will surprise you. You'll read about tactics and you'll learn about caring. You'll learn about accountability and you'll read about morale. Several of the chapters are organized with three steps, four tactics, seven actions. Yes, this may be a military sort of model, but it's also good writing and reading. <br />The book is filled with anecdotes, practical stuff that you can sink your teeth into. The examples, mostly from the military environment, effectively illustrate the numerous points Cohen makes. The military examples are from present day and historical lessons, and they're combined with a good selection of civilian stories. Leaders and prospective leaders, both military and civilian, will enjoy the book for its lessons and for its high level of readability. The stories make the teaching points come alive. <br />Yes, this is a leadership book. But it practically reads like a novel. You'll get caught up in the reading to the point where you might even forget that you're reading a practical guide to getting people to follow you. The New Art of the Leader is very appropriate for airplane reading, but have your pen and highlighter handy!<br />Good index and notes for research and follow-up reading.	2003-07-09

Spread the message to others.	Recent corporate scandals have shaken confidence in leadership and the ethical underpinnings of the business world. Without significant change, we risk increasing problems in the years ahead. It's time for leaders to step forth, declare a commitment to ethical performance, and set the example.<br />\\"Absolute Honesty\\" tells it like it is, and like it must be. Johnson and Phillips, management consultants who have been inside and seen how things work, have produced a powerful tool. This easy-to-read book emphasizes that no one argues against corporate integrity, but some executives need support on HOW to apply the principles. Readers of \\"Absolute Honesty\\" will learn how to build the right kind of cultural infrastructure.<br />The authors argue that too many companies adhere to what they call \\"the Kumbaya Syndrome---embrace all decisions, no matter how stupid or unethical; smile and sing the company campfire song.\\" It's too easy to just go along, and confronting or fighting superiors or The System is frowned upon. <br />The alternative is to apply their Six Laws of Absolute Honesty: Tell the Truth, Tackle the Problems, Disagree and Commit, Welcome the Truth, Reward the Messenger, and Build a Platform of Integrity. A chapter on each of the laws explains what needs to be done, with effective supporting material including advice, anecdotes, and a style that makes the whole process comfortable and acceptable. <br />The book is organized into three parts. The first part, The Challenge, includes chapters on The Naked Truth and A Culture of Absolute Honesty. These 52 pages set the stage nicely for the rest of the book. Part 2 presents the Six Laws, with engaging detail. Part 3 is aptly entitled \\"Where Do We Go from Here?\\" The final two chapters discuss building an ethical infrastructure and Key Points to Help Your Implementation Efforts. Lots of good, practical advice here. The book concludes with Notes and a good index. <br />You'll find this book to be a disarmingly fast read. There's a personal sort of feeling that draws the reader into the subject and keeps the flow moving. This book is one you'll keep in your office-for reference and to send a message to all who enter.	2003-07-05

You'll be frustrated in your quest for something new. If this is a brand-new field for you, this book will give you a good survey of the stories, old saws, and oft-repeated phrases and concepts. Many of these gleanings, though not all, are cited in the notes section at the back of the book.<br />I suspect that this book was self-published using the services of book designers who either don't know what they're doing or think they're really creative. Trying to read an entire book in a sans-serif typeface was hard on the eyes. Chapter starts were not strongly called out, making it difficult to separate sections of the book to organize thinking as a reader.<br />The flow of the text was interrupted a number of times with the presentation of extraneous information that really didn't contribute to the author's points. I got the feeling that there was a lot of filler in these pages.<br />The authors describe categories of Equity Sensitivity-Benevolents, Equity Sensitives, and Entitleds-to explain that there's a balance to be achieved. Give to others and they'll give to you.  With my knowledge of leadership, I found these descriptions to be relatively shallow, causing me to get bored and distracted. It was a challenge for me to make it all the way to the last pages of the book. It doesn't take 300 pages to state that people work for more than money and that the relationship with the immediate supervisor is paramount.	2003-07-03

There were plenty of employment opportunities-locally and across the country and the world. With such abundance, a lot of people were just jumping without investing sufficient time and thought into the decisions they were making. <br />Then the economy tanked, taking a lot of hopeful careers down with it. Hark! The economy is coming back! Things are picking up again and workers will have an increasing number of job options open to them. As we shift back toward a sellers' market, workers in all fields will again have decisions to make. The search for new opportunities is kicking into gear and thousands of people will be looking for exciting jobs...which may not be right around the corner.<br />This book will take you step-by-step through a process that has baffled many job-seekers over the years. Nope, it's not one of those academic treatises full of theoretical stuff. You'll have a workbook in your hands-one that will put ideas in your head, questions in front of your face, and pages to write things down. \\"Greener Pastures\\" is very specifically for people who are looking for a job in another location; they want to move to another city, another state, for whatever reason(s). <br />In the initial chapter, Andrea Kay, a specialist in job seeking, will challenge why you want to consider a move in the first place. Be ready to be forced into some research-internal and external. Then, in the subsequent chapters, you'll find questions, information, suggestions, and techniques to streamline your process. Your mind will be opened by this book, which will also help you fill it back up again with the information you need to find that distant job the right way. Result: you'll go after your next position with a significantly higher level of confidence which will support greater achievement.<br />Bonus: You'll find some good resources in theback of the book, right before the comprehensive index. \\"Greener Pastures\\" is a usable tool.<br />Note: While this book is based on an out-of-town focus, there is plenty of value for the job-seeker who does not necessarily want to move to another city. The process may reaffirm your desire to grow where you are planted. \\"Greener Pastures\\" is a book whose time has come...again.	2003-06-30

Barbara Glanz is multi-focused, coming from her heart (the soft stuff) as well as from her head (loads of information and advice). Result: she produced a heart-felt tool to enrich your life.<br />The title is deceiving, but is clarified in the subtitle. Balancing Acts. Hey, we're all trying to be better balanced in today's rush-rush life where work, family, personal, spiritual, and community aspects compete for our time, attention, and devotion. Glanz's advice? Give it up. That elusive \\"balance\\" won't happen. Instead, blend your work and non-work lives so the ever-changing combination works for you. The formula will be different for each of us, and many of us need some good ideas about how to design our own personal mix. As the subtitle tells us, this easy-to-use volume delivers more than 250 blending ideas for your consideration.<br />The chapters are well-organized, following an introduction that nicely sets the stage for why this issue is so important-for people like you and me and for employers. Following a foundation chapter and a section on understanding the various facets of our lives, the text is organized into chapters exploring ideas to blend work with family, friends, health, spirit, and service. A summary chapter pulls it all together. <br />The writing is conversational in tone; this is a very comfortable book to read. Call-outs and cartoons enhance the ease and fun of the experience. Supplementing the chapters are an appendix of questions that will prompt productive discussions with family (and yourself). You'll also find pages of resources, including notes and a bibliography that will empower you to continue growing even beyond where this book will take you.<br />Expect to mark up the pages, turn down the corners, and keep this book around for a while. This attachment means you'll probably purchase additional copies for your friends, relatives, and co-workers. Be sure to inscribe the copy you giveto your boss!	2003-06-29

The word is out: manage your finances well or you're in trouble. Even as our economy improves, this topic will continue to be critical. Every executive, manager, and aspiring manager must be familiar with the concepts of corporate finance. <br />If you are not a financial wizard, and most of us aren't, this book will give you the depth and breadth of understanding to \\"speak the language.\\" Twelve well-organized chapters present the vital information about the role of financial management, the various reports that are generated-why and what they mean, profit and cash flow, and critical performance factors. The author, a Certified Management Consultant and Certified Professional Accountant with years of advisory and teaching experience under his belt, then delves into specialized areas. Readers will learn about cost accounting, business planning, budgeting, financing a business, and attracting outside investors. There is a tremendous amount of information packed into these pages.<br />As part of McGraw-Hill's Briefcase Book series, this book is filled with seven types of call-out boxes: Smart Managing, Cautions, Tricks of the Trade, Key Terms, Examples, Tools, and Mistake-Proofing. This is the kind of book you will read through to get a comprehensive picture, then return to as a reference book for yourself and others. The author's writing style is personal and conversational---like having a chat with an accountant who can explain what you don't understand...and what you don't even know that you don't understand. The depth is here. <br />There have been a number of books written on this topic over the years, many of them thick, heavy, and filled with small print and hard-to-comprehend charts and graphs. This book is designed to be enjoyed and absorbed: larger type, lightweight, and readable. Graphs and charts are clear; they make sense.<br />If you're going to read---and keep---a book on finance for people who don't go there frequently, this is the book. Clear some space on your bookshelf. This one's a keeper!	2003-06-24
US	52870090	R299L1AJ9HBHGG	0446529117	313775121	It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy	Books	4	95	103	N	N	Your Ship, My Story	This book and its author have received a lot of media exposure, so I decided to check it out. While Abrashoff espouses proven leadership techniques, the only really new learning is how one man applied the principles on a Navy ship with a complement of 311 sailors. This is more a story of one man's awakening to how leadership is considerably more effective than management; how getting out of people's way is wiser than micromanaging them. <br />Leadership is emphasized in the book, and in every endorsement quote on the back cover. Yet, the subtitle says \\"management techniques,\\" not \\"leadership techniques.\\" Leadership did not come easy to Abrashoff; he had a lot of learning to do...and undo. As he moves through the chapters, this retired Navy Captain talks about his experiences in leading by example, listening, communicating purpose and meaning, creating a climate of trust, focusing on results, taking calculated risks, building people and unity, and strengthening quality of life. <br />Good leaders can tell you all about these concepts and how they are applied in their organization. Aspiring leaders and those who have not yet seen the light will be awe-struck by what Abrashoff accomplished. Solid, experienced leaders will see this book as more of a case study and a reinforcement of what they're already doing. As I have observed today's military leaders-as a citizen and as a consultant who has had the privilege of working with military leaders, the \\"system\\" is not as counterproductive as the author would lead us to believe. Bureaucracy is still bureaucracy, but Abrashoff is not alone in his practice of leadership skills.<br />Abrashoff applied leadership skills on his ship to achieve significant measurable results. I'm glad he documented his achievements so others might be inspired. I noted that he compared and linked his military experiences and perspectives to civilian applications. Through relationships with Fast Company magazine and other organizations, this authoris now giving speeches and probably consulting. This book and the attendant publicity could be viewed as effective tools to position him as a sought-after speaker.<br />In all fairness, while the leadership principles and anecdotes from the USS Benfold are certainly present, this book struck me as more of an autobiography of the growth of a leader. For a treatise about leadership and considering the title, I was surprised to see such heavy use of first person pronouns in the writing. <br />Company owners and senior executives will find the book valuable as a case study of one man's experience. Managers will learn principles and techniques that can substantially improve their performance. Some readers will feel reinforced; others will feel discomforted by the heavy sense of ego and rationalization. It's a shame that Abrashoff did not choose to stay in the Navy to effect those changes he says are so needed; instead he left the service to write a book focused on two years of his work and hit the lecture circuit.	2003-06-23

This one has several advantages that make it worth the investment of your time and money.<br />While it contains a lot of information, insight, and inspiration, this is not a long book that makes the acquisition of knowledge a laborious process. Less than 200 pages-tight and comfortable. The text is highly readable-nicely designed and easy on the eyes.<br />The subject matter is well organized. Meyer offers nine principles, each succinctly presented in its own discreet chapter. The chapters are all presented in the same format, making it even easier for the reader to grasp the concepts. The principle is presented, followed by a section on Learned Blocks-the things that get in our way of applying the particular principle of creativity. The third section of each chapter is Doing Things Differently-how to get out of your own way and gain the greatest benefit from application of the learning.<br />The language of the book is appropriate for smooth movement through the material. I didn't encounter stumbling blocks of words, phrases, or explanations that forced me to puzzle out what the author was saying. There's a sort of conversational tone, enriched by the author's personal anecdotes and illustrative stories about others' experiences with her creativity principles.<br />The book closes with a valuable bibliography. No index-not needed. The author's background is broad and significant for the reader. She practices what she preaches as a consultant, professional speaker, and university instructor. Her background in improvisational theatre contributes to her expression of creativity in ways readers \\"get it.\\"	2003-06-20

You'll enjoy a conversation about a wide range of relevant topics with someone who's become a sort of legend in the human resources (HR) field. If you're not in HR, thinking about going into HR, or related to someone in HR, this book will have less value for you.<br />That said, we must appreciate that a book written in one specialty field may also have value for professionals in another field. While many of the stories and perspectives won't be germane for marketing people, financial folks, or sales professionals, there are some cross-functional lessons to be learned. Although the book is obviously intended for an HR audience, it will have value for people in other professions in the corporate world.<br />Over the course of 44 chapters, Sartain, who gained fame as Vice President of People for Southwest Airlines, shares her experiences-and some advice-with readers. She shows how valuable HR can be to an organization and how meaningful a career HR can be. This volume will be powerfully reinforcing for people in the field, describing some of the ups and downs and lessons of the author's experience. Anyone contemplating entering the field-or debating about staying in HR-should read these pages. <br />Readers will gain a better understanding of what Sartain did to build her career, as well as where things didn't go so well. This is not a touchy-feely gushy book as the title might imply, but a realistic report that confronts a wide range of issues in the profession head-on. The chapters are full of advice, some presented directly and some inferred by the lessons learned by the author. <br />HR from the Heart is the kind of book that will be read thoughtfully by a senior or mid-level professional in the HR field, then passed around to colleagues. Thought-provoking, its reading will stimulate conversations that will raise sensitivities, intensify reality, offer balance, and probably hold some people in the profession that have given some thought to leaving. HR is a field in transition, in search of its rightful place in the corporate design. The contents of Sartain's book, assembled with the able assistance of the insightful professional writer, Martha Finney, comfortably address issues in a way that will aid in the growth of respect for HR and its influence on the corporate world.	2003-06-13

For the first time in history, workers had tremendous freedom in choosing the kind of work they would do, where they would do that work, and what employer they would work for. Work was transformed from being a drudgery-something that has to be done-to an experience that could actually be enjoyable and fulfilling. In a sellers' market, workers could actually manage their career destiny...and their personal lives. We began to see a movement toward enriching the balance between work and life.<br />In 1998, this book was a little bit ahead of its time. People were starting to seek more meaningfulness in their lives, but still weren't quite sure how to define it. Many of us were not even sure we were entitled or deserving of such a life, so different from the work-as-central-to-life core belief. <br />If the economy hadn't slowed, this book probably would have been a pretty strong seller. If rediscovered, I'll bet it could be a very popular book. The message is right on target and the book itself is very readable and well put-together. The chapters are heavily seasoned with brief stories from workers, identified only by first name. Whether they are true stories or whether they are created by the author to make her points, they are effectively illustrative and add value to the text. The same added value applies to the summaries at the end of each chapter. The table of contents is enhanced to give the reader a strong sense of the messages that are conveyed so well in these pages. <br />The book is organized into ten chapters that are revealing in their titles: Work is More Than a Paycheck, How Core Beliefs Keep Us Stuck in the Wrong Job, Stress and the Workplace, Finding time to Find Wise Work, When Quitting is the Best Option, What to Do Before You Lose or Leave Your Job, What to Do After You've Lost Your Job, Managing Change, The Heart of Wise Work, and Balance-Working and Having a Life. <br />For several years, thousands of people have been out of work and/or trapped in jobs they  don't like. As the economy picks up, these people will be seeking, searching, wondering...and hoping. If you fit in this category, pick up a copy of \\"From Making a Living to Having a Life.\\" Your insight will grow, your stress will drop, and you'll be on the way to a new phase of life that will be delightfully different for you and those around you. This book is coming back...and so are you!	2003-05-26

I picked up this book expecting to find a clear, concise formula to selling more. Of course, I knew that hundreds, if not thousands, of sales trainers and consultants have suggested that they have secrets to success. Some of these folks deliver the same messages that everyone else does-there's no magic pill, you just have to work hard and smart. Others say they have new answers, new approaches, but the secrets are usually the same messages, twisted around to look differently.<br />The message woven into these pages is that effectiveness is more important than efficiency. Gooze takes many pages to convey this message, delivered in more of a consultant's conversational mode than a step-by-step system. He does, however, suggest that there's a systematic approach to the selling process.<br />Unfortunately, the writing in this book just didn't grab me. The author is probably a fine consultant and active professional. However, in a book review, I must confine my judgment to how I perceive the book and not what may lie behind it. In this case, knowing the reputation of the author, I expected more than I got.	2003-05-25

They searched for days to no avail, then suddenly-right in front of them-was a huge lion!<BR>The lion saw them, too, and thought, \\"lunch!\\" One of the men reached into his knapsack, retrieved his running shoes, and began putting them on. His friend, incredulous, mocked, \\"You'll never outrun that lion.\\" The first man responded, \\"I don't have to outrun the lion; I just have to outrun you!\\"<br />The speed of business has increased, along with the speed of change. Today, and in the years ahead, the prizes will go to the companies that anticipate the trends, then move most quickly and wisely to put themselves in the right place at the right time. Those firms that allow any employee-at any level-to tie them to tradition or to get in the way of progress risk extinction. Given the title, we'd expect to find the secrets in the pages of this book. Readers will find quite a few tips, some great lessons, snappy writing, and valuable summary lists at the end of each chapter. There's a lot of good content here, but also some annoying redundancy.<br />This well-organized book moves steadily and deliberately through a collection of strategies that stimulate thinking and action. A number of examples are offered to illustrate fast movement and not-fast-enough movement. Many of the anecdotes and case studies come from the same companies, which is both good and bad. We see deeper into these companies, but miss the opportunity to appreciate the strategies and actions of a wider range of organizations. Hearing about the same companies over and over again made me wonder if the authors had investigated any other examples. The sameness got old.<br />Toward the end of the book, the reader may sense some repetition, as if the authors forgot they had mentioned these things or were looking for filler to complete the manuscript at the end of their writing process. I sensed some redundancy in the main body of the book, but as the manuscript drew to a close I almost lost interest because I was reading words I'd already read.<br />There's a lot of good content in this volume, so I'll still recommend it. Look for the tips, the advice, and the strategies that will inspire you to make notes, turn down pages, and highlight various sections. While the book wasn't 100% for me, there are a lot of valuable and thought-provoking lessons in these pages. Many of the ideas and observations are sufficiently thought-provoking to stimulate change in the way you do things, particularly if you perceive yourself to be in a competitive environment.<br />This review refers to the hardcover edition.	2003-05-11

I'll admit to being a bit jaundiced by one book after another comparing biblical characters and ancient historical figures like Attila the Hun to today's situations and leaders. But, if AMACOM, the publishing division of the American Management Association, is presenting this book, maybe there is some substance in these pages after all. <br />I opened the book with apprehension, half-expecting a Bible-thumping worship of religious heroes. Surprise! I was captivated right away by the almost conversational tone of the writing that pulled me in. The messages are much more \\"real,\\" than pushy. The preachiness I feared did not materialize. Instead, lessons were shared on the fundamentals of leadership, with examples from Biblical characters and modern-day corporate and political leaders. <br />Woolfe is obviously quite conversant with the Bible, its stories, and its lessons. I am not, so I was frankly concerned that I wouldn't have the knowledge to relate to the book's teachings and message. I found that Woolfe described enough about each character and story that I understood. The people cited-Biblical and modern, are used as vehicles for Woolfe to make his points about ten attributes of leaders: honesty and integrity, purpose, kindness and compassion, humility, communication, performance management, team development, courage, justice and fairness, and leadership development. <br />As you read this book, expect to pause to reflect frequently. It will be a comfortable experience, rather than an unsettling challenge to your morals. Each chapter concludes with Biblical lessons on the theme of the chapter-not religious, Biblical. It's sort of a comparison of management literature from two different eras and not at all intimidating. A good set of reference notes and an index add value to the book.<br />Commentary: Understandably, this book addresses Judeo-Christian culture-both in its themes and it's content and treatment. It would be interesting to see a set of these books, with similar comparisons to perceived qualities of leaders and the religious literature of the culture that supports the written heritage.	2003-05-11

Books	5	14	14	N	N	Outstanding in Content, Flow, and Design	Employers and educators-parents, too-are befuddled by the younger generation. So, what's new? We've had that condition for generations. Ah, but this generation is quite different than anything we've encountered in history. Today's young people seem to be wired differently, making them more difficult to understand and work with. This book will lift the fog, increasing your insight, appreciation, and skill to more effectively tap this powerful resource.<br />The book is divided into three sections. In the first part of the book, Chester explains Generation Why's traits, values, and perspectives-the good, the bad, and the ugly. Readers will gain valuable insights into a generation that will have a tremendous impact on the workplace and on society. This section of the book is well-constructed as a sort of stream of consciousness that will hold your attention as your knowledge expands.<br />The second section is filled with information and advice for employers. You'll learn about recruiting, training, managing, appearance, fun, recognition and rewards, and retention in bite-size pieces. The design of this book is quite appropriate, as it fits the way your mind must work if you are to be successful in connecting with Gen Why. And that takes us to the third section-ways to connect...and disconnect...with these unique individuals. <br />Now the fine points. This book delivers useful information, but it also provides interpretation. You learn and you understand after reading each section. The consistent format aids in absorbing the volume of knowledge presented in these pages. Call-outs will help scanning readers grab the high points, but don't be surprised if they pull you into the text looking for more. <br />Reading a book with this much detail can be overwhelming. In these cases, I find myself wishing there were some kind of a summary or explanatory index at the end of the book. Bullet points would remind me of what I'd read and help me \\"get\\" the major concepts without wading through all the text again. Chester has done us all a big favor by presenting such an executive summary, chapter by chapter, at the end of the book. You can actually start at the end of the book to get an overview, then dig into the details. <br />This book is designed for efficient use, as well as an effective vehicle to deliver a considerable amount of information. There are no guarantees that you'll be totally successful working with Gen Whys after absorbing this book, but you'll be miles ahead of those who haven't read it yet.<br />Side note: as a consultant and speaker, I address generational issues in my work. Even with my prior knowledge, I gained quite a bit from Chester's work and will confidently recommend it to all my clients who might employ these young people. Come to think of it, that would be all my clients. Employers, teachers, parents, preachers-read this book!	2003-05-03

I don't read much fiction; so much of it seems a waste of time. A friend suggested this book, so I reluctantly agreed to take Recompense my next trip instead of a business book.<br />I started reading the book in the airport while waiting for my flight. I almost missed my plane! I did not engage in conversation with my seat-mate on the trip. I wanted to read this book. When I finished my business in Washington, D.C, I took the Metro to go to my hotel and missed my stop-had to go back. I finally gave up reading at 2:30 a.m. because my eyelids wouldn't stay open. I finished the book on the plane on the way home. <br />Hammock grabbed my attention from the beginning and wouldn't let go. If you like television shows like Law &amp; Order, you'll love this book. But you'll never see this story on Law &amp; Order; there's just too much in it. Too much detail. Too many twists and turns. A television production could not do this story justice, but the printed word sure does!<br />I was drawn by the flashbacks that tie each character to the heartbeat of the story in a unique way. The subplots are interwoven beautifully and only rarely was I able to guess what was coming next. The detail is incredible, making me wonder if the author actually lived this story. And, if so, which character was she? The accuracy tells me that the author definitely did her research. The use language was entirely appropriate, the descriptions vivid. Forgive me if I sound like I'm gushing, but I really got wrapped up in this book. <br />I won't spend time in this review telling you about the tale. It's too intricate. Suffice to say it's a very human mystery, love story, and adventure all rolled into one volume. <br />Now let me tell you the amazing part of this situation. The author is a graduate student in professional writing at Maryland's Towson University. This treasure is her first book! I'd wager she's earning top grades in that graduate program. I'm ready for her next book already. I'll be watching, hoping it comes soon.<br />A prediction: after you read Recompense, you will want to give the book to someone else to read. Your enthusiasm will inspire another person to join me as a fan of Joyce Hammock.<br />Now I must force myself to go back to my business books. What a delightful break!	2003-04-26

Over the past few years, we have not seen the competitive intensity in recruiting that we saw in the go-go years of the late 1990s because of the slowed economy. This quieter period has given technologists and strategists a chance to catch up, to develop new approaches, to refine new systems. The new designs for attracting preferred candidates were not even available a few years ago; now they will be essential for employers desiring to find, attract, and hire the best talent to achieve their objectives.<br />Finding applicants through newspaper advertising will be with us for a while, for some jobs. Even some of those jobs are now offered through major job boards. For the positions beyond low-skilled welders, fast-food burger flippers, and convenience store clerks, employers will increasingly use the internet to recruit. This shift shatters the myth that hiring is local; the web is world-wide. Recruiting is global.<br />OK, with this historical and future-focused concept in mind, how do we do this on-line recruiting? Foster's book tells us-step by step at a strategic level and at a tactical level. It is not a book for webmasters, recruiting site developers, or code programmers. This book delivers on the higher levels, providing company owners, executives, and managers a valuable insight into what needs to be done and why. Human resource executives will find this volume very helpful. Some HR managers will find it a great tool to open deeper discussion with their superiors; others will find it more valuable in their efforts to understand where their leaders are trying to go.<br />The book begins, appropriately, with some of the \\"big picture\\" of recruiting, then turns to the use of the internet. In Chapter 1, there is a list of stages to the process of e-recruiting: recruit your friends, create or enhance your organization's recruiting web site, attract the best candidates, find passive candidates, and assess your applicants. The organization of the book is different, which may throw off a reader expecting an expansion of the five stages. Foster explores various aspects of the recruiting website in Part Two, but Part Three is titled Advertise Your Job Openings. Part Four is Searching for Passive Candidates, but there is not a separate section on assessing applicants-which will be an increasingly important aspect of e-recruiting. You'll find a tremendous amount of valuable insight in these pages.<br />The book is seasoned with a wide range of resources, mostly presented (understandably) as website addresses. Some I recognized, others I'd heard of, and there were still some the author missed (like [...] for recruiting communities); but, this is a rapidly-changing field. Many readers will find themselves a bit overwhelmed and confused as they read this book. So much information all at once! Yes, that's the reality; and it's a good lesson. Read the book cover to cover, then go back with a highlighter and a pad (or note-taking computer file) to design the right strategy for your company. You'll be reading about cutting-edge ideas and resources, so don't expect to grasp it all right away. Commentary on trends and processes is well interwoven with things to do. Expect to be inspired, stimulated, and fully-loaded with work to do.	2003-04-21

When I review a book, I consider a number of different factors. Among my considerations is the suitability of the book to what appears to be the intended market-the intended reader.<br />Looking at a title like \\"How to be a Star at Work,\\" I assume that the book is designed to inspire and instruct people who are not stars at work. Perhaps I'm being a bit pedantic here, but I question how many non-stars would gleefully pick up a 300+ page book to learn the Secrets of Business Life. <br />OK, I've got that out of my system. Let's dig a little deeper. The book is based on research, written by a college professor. Kelley teaches at Carneigie Mellon University's business school and, as may be expected, does a lot of research and publishing. Goes with the territory. This book reports on ten years of research at major companies, revealing nine factors for success: initiative, networking, self-management, perspective, followership, leadership, teamwork, street smarts, and show-and-tell (to the right audience). <br />As you read that list, you may be thinking, \\"no-brainer; should I waste my time with this book?\\" On a shallow level, that's a fair assessment. As you read deeper through these pages, however, you'll discover many subtle innuendos in each of these categories. You'll learn from the thought-provoking anecdotes-all with the names changed, of course. The experiences of the employees described are somewhat interwoven with political issues that are more prevalent in large companies than smaller enterprises.  This environment-resident factor may taint your sense of relevance if you don't work for a big organization, but don't be fooled. The advice is solid for all sizes of employers. <br />This book may not be read heavily by its assumed primary target, but will still be quite valuable to supervisors, managers, leaders, and mentors who coach and guide others to improve their effectiveness and strategic career development.	2003-04-09
US	52870090	R1HG13M15LC1MW	047123608X	30319042	A Genie's Wisdom: A Fable of How a CEO Learned to Be a Marketing Genius	Books	5	2	5	N	N	Enjoyable read, enlightening, thought-provoking	Let?s begin by introducing the author. Jack Trout is recognized as a guru in the field of marketing. He popularized the concept of ?positioning? in the customer?s mind and has written numerous books on various aspects of marketing. Without question, this is an expert you?d love to have on-call whenever you have a question about marketing.<br />Company owners and top executives outside the marketing field understand the vital need for effective marketing. However, when marketing mavens start babbling, it?s difficult to gain enough comprehension to make educated decisions. The topic can be very confusing, especially when people start spewing jargon that muddies the clarity needed to know what resources to allocate and what results to expect.<br />When the marketing stuff gets overwhelming, CEOs wish they had a genie who would pop out of an ancient lantern to answer all the questions and build an easier understanding of the field. In this deceivingly small volume, Jack Trout provides the genie to aid the CEO?and the reader. But, these are modern times, so the genie?s residence of choice is a laptop computer. Our Aladdin discovers a mysterious computer on his desk one morning and can?t resist turning it on. Poof! The genie appears and offers to answer ten questions about marketing for the CEO.<br />The remaining chapters each present a scenario a non-enlightened CEO (someone without marketing expertise) might face in the course of business. Seeking guidance, our CEO flips on the computer to gain knowledge from the genie. As we move through the book, insightful responses to the CEO?s questions help clarify what marketing is all about. This is not an in-depth treatise; note that the entire book is only 120 pages long.<br />The treatment is solid, yet light enough to be easy, enjoyable reading. The genie gives examples by talking about other CEOs as if he?d advised them in the past. In a delightful tongue-in-cheek, the genie even quotes Jack Trout on one occasion! Even with all my knowledge about marketing, I learned a lot?and got some stimulation to think more deeply about a few issues I?m working with in my own company.<br />A Genie?s Wisdom is easy to read on the plane (lightweight book) or in bed in the evening as you?re winding down. After you refer back to it a couple of times, you?ll probably pass it to a colleague or friend. It?s just that kind of book.	2003-03-30

The writing style, like sitting in on a conversation, hooked me in the first few pages. You'll find this book to be a deceivingly quick read, though you'll probably catch yourself a number of times-stopping, looking back over what you just read, and asking \\"what did he say?\\" Some of the lessons kind of sneak up on you.<br />The premise of Connellan's approach is that three factors influence success: Expectations, Responsibility, and Feedback. He relates those factors to improving human performance-in business, in school, in family relationships, in personal development. Some improvement is measurable; some is not, but you know the improvement is there. <br />In 15 chapters, the reader takes a journey through Connellan's three keys. After a couple of introductory chapters on why people fall short and how to create consistently high performance, each of the keys is explained, with how-to, by a consultant/counselor. His workshop participants listen, then put the theories to work. A chapter on each success story illustrates what can be done in a teaching mode that's inspirational at the same time.<br />I like the practicality of this book. You'll find plenty of good ideas, well-presented. The last few pages hold a surprise: a Leader's Tool Kit to put the book's lessons to work. While reemphasizing his three keys-confidence and expectations, accountability, and appropriate feedback, Connellan offers additional resources and suggestions.<br />This book will be valuable for educators, parents, coaches, and corporate executives at all level. It's small enough so it's not intimidating, but filled with a lot more value than you'd expect.	2003-03-24
US	52870090	R89BL3Z8UL7O9	0735200521	360827717	Journey to the Emerald City: Achieve a Competitive Edge by Creating a Culture of Accountability	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Good Content, Don't Need Toto	In 1998, the authors wrote The Oz Principle around the concept that \\"an organization will perform at its highest potential if, and only if, each of its members assumes personal accountability for achieving its results.\\" Thus, Conners and Smith emphasize a corporate culture that is based on personal accountability, with leaders, goals, tasks, teams, and every aspect of organizational life connected to that theme.<br />I will admit to being put off by the title and the cover. Wizard of Oz? Dorothy and her red shoes? The Cowardly Lion? Do I have time for fables and games? There are some mentions of Frank Baum's classic, some quotes, and some relationships like explaining that managers don't have magic. Overall, however, this book is a solid management book on changing organizational culture. And that's a vital issue for a lot of companies today. <br />The book is organized into three sections whose titles give good insight into the value and flow of the text: Understanding Company Culture, Shifting to a New Culture, and Accelerating Culture Change. The ten chapters explain the concepts and a process for moving forward in an organized, results-oriented fashion. The book is filled with practical approaches that can open a company to achievements that have been trapped inside by a dysfunctional culture. The key is accountability that starts at the top of the organization with an open and complete style of leadership. No games: communication. <br />The authors show us how to change the way people think and act. They show how to get people involved in a positive way so transformation can occur. Culture change is a journey, a journey that can be taken at an agonizingly slow pace, a normal flow (whatever that is), or moved to a higher level of velocity and enthusiasm. Graphics and an index enhance the book's value, which is far beyond the connection to the Oz story.<br />You'll learn from consultants who have \\"been there\\" and achieved results. The knowledge you gain will enable you to achieve some change in your organization based on what these men have learned and share in this book.	2003-03-15

You might find it stimulating.\\"<br />How right he was! There are some really important messages in this volume for people who want to be really effective in the sales process. Whether we're professional salespeople or professionals who have to sell our services and products, we need to know how to reach the right people in the right way to earn the desired decisions. There are probably more books, tapes, and training courses on sales than on any other topic. <br />This one is different. Subtle. Higher level. If you're a CEO, the owner of your company, or operate at a pretty high level (or you should be), invest a little time to read this book. It won't take you long. The reading flows well, the anecdotes provide effective and believable illustrations, and the chapters are only long enough to make their points. The summaries at the end of each chapter will keep you focused.<br />You'll learn 16 steps to high achievement as you open your mind to increasing your odds of success. Some of what you read will be new, thought-provoking ideas. Some will be insights that jog your memory and almost embarrass you. You'll read about techniques that have worked well when you've done them, but that you dropped when you relapsed back to the numbers game. <br />To be honest, before I finished this book I was starting a list of things I need to do differently. You'll feel like you're sitting in a comfortable room with a really good coach or mentor...who is making you uncomfortable with observations, teachings, and inquiries. As you move out of your comfort zone (read: &quot;rut&quot;), you'll realize how a few changes in your process-and your thinking-will drive much different results. <br />A bonus (and you'll appreciate why I say this after reading this book): the author's address is in the book so you can send him a note to thank him. If you're open to significant change that will overwhelm the competition, read this book soon. My only concern is that my competitors may see this!	2003-03-15

First was the author's photo on the front cover-rather unusual. But, if you're a Black woman in today's world, achieving at a high level, there's something to say here. Flipping over to the back cover, I saw testimonials from Peter Senge, Frances Hesselbein (President and CEO of the Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management), Warren Bennis, Jack Kemp, the chairman of ServiceMaster, the president of London Fog, and more. OK, this woman is connected, obviously valued by some people who are careful about where their names appear. Foreword by Max De Pree, former chairman and CEO of Herman Miller, Inc.<br />Checking her biography, I learned that she served for two years as executive director of the Federal Quality Institute, appointed by President Clinton. Prior to that she was vice president for people and quality for Herman Miller. The impressive list goes on. This is a woman who knows what makes the difference between high achieving organizations and also-rans. <br />In her first chapter, Hunt talks about visioning-imagining the world we want to create. Her emphasis is on leading and living on purpose. She talks about change and how we need good foundations to thrive when everything is changing around us at a frightening pace. \\"I believe vision fuels our passion and lifts us above our fear.\\" The redesign, realignment, reinvention must be done with a deliberate urgency, engaging the hearts and minds of the people who comprise organizations and communities. Dream makers inspire their people-all their stakeholders-to move consciously and purposefully into the future. We can all learn from their examples. <br />The next twelve chapters consist of twelve stories of people who make a difference. At the end of each chapter is a summary of lessons learned. Each one of these stories could be a valuable book all by itself, so this collection has a lot to offer. The book concludes with some personal philosophy fromthe author, putting the frosting on the cake. Recommended for leaders and aspiring leaders who want to gain greater insights into the kinds of things that make life and organizations work a lot better.	2003-03-09

This knowledge, that everyone SHOULD have already, is packed into pages full of success tips, anecdotes, timesaving tips and things to remember. Each of those categories has its own icon, with the tip appearing in bold-face type. The result of this design is that the book is difficult to read from a flow perspective. The presentation makes the reader jump from one category to another then back to the basic text that was interrupted. <br /> <br />And there's no listing of all the success tips or all the timesaving tips to give the reader this kind of value all in one place. Many of the anecdotes are short paragraphs about a minor life experience, presented without embellishment or a real tie to the text other than commentary. The book does have an index, but more could have been done to consolidate the highlights. <br /> <br />Mayer is also the author of four books on how to use the ACT! contact management software developed by Symantec. A significant part of this book is consumed with suggestions about how to use that program to be more organized and productive. The reader might get the feeling that this is yet another book on ACT! with some fundamentals of time and life management wrapped around it. <br /> <br />You'll find tips on time management, networking, conversation, master planning, and more. If you're just beginning life in the business world, you'll probably find this book quite helpful. If you've been around for a while, you'll pick up a few tips but may become bored with the simplicity and the continual shallow presentation of multiple tips to be a success at whatever you do.  <br />In spite of the organization, it's all mixed up together like a tossed salad. Pick out the stuff you want to eat and leave the anchovies.	2003-03-09

Their people are their most valuable strategic resource, though many executives don't realize the importance of having highly competent people on their team. Too often employers allow themselves to be satisfied with less that adequate capacity. <br />As we have warned in our book, \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People,\\" this decade will see the most severe shortage of skilled workers in history. A major strategic advantage in this highly competitive environment will be the opportunity for training and education. Workers, dedicated to managing their own careers, will be increasingly hungry for training to build their skills so they can stay marketable. Sharp employers will invest huge amounts of resources to enhance the capacity of current employees to avoid the need to spend heavily to recruit qualified people from the outside.<br />No longer can employers just throw training at employees, like spaghetti, watching to see how much sticks. Now the focus must be on understanding exactly what is needed-to meet the needs of the individual employees as well as the current and future needs of the employer. This book is filled with powerful information that will enable wise employers to accurately assess training needs to those needs can be met in whatever ways are appropriate. <br />Note: this book is very focused. Do not expect to wander into topics like how to convince the boss to pay for more training or how to use computer-based training to teach skills. The power of this book is the tight focus on assessing training needs and your organization's effectiveness in meeting those needs. Using the methodologies presented in easy-to-understand practical fashion, the reader will be able to avoid the course-of-the-week training mentality. No more stress training just because it's Tuesday. No more customer service training because it's a nice thing to do. Focus now on true needs that, once met well, will influence the organization's bottom line. <br />Using this book will enable you to evaluate the effectiveness of your training function, assess various tools to determine the prioritized needs of your constituencies, and how to apply the information gathered to design a training program that will make a real difference for the organization. Resources are tight, so the better you are able to assess before you act, the more efficient you will be. <br />The text is supported by graphics showing forms to use, checklists to follow, and a book design that makes even this thick a book comfortable to use. The book is accompanied by a CD-ROM with the forms and a step-by-step approach to this vital information gathering and assessment-before-implementation process. <br />While this book will be most useful for corporate training and human resource professionals, it will also be helpful for senior executives striving to understand the power of effective training. Owners of mid-sized and many smaller companies that don't have training directors will find this book to be a tool they can use to build and maintain a strong work team. Work methodically with this tool; take your time in reading and application. There's a lot here.<br />Roger Herman, Certified Management Consultant specializing in <BR>workforce issues.	2003-03-09

For the past few years, payrolls have been substantially reduced as companies sought every way possible to operate lean. The economic downturn has inspired leaders to restructure their organizations, saying good-bye to long-term employees who no longer fit while, at the same time, bringing in fresh workers with the skills needed for the new corporate design.<br />The challenge through all this turmoil is to retain your top talent and control costs. That combination is difficult to achieve, since highly proficient employees also expect to be highly compensated. This dilemma has been front-burner for the past few years. Will it continue to be an issue as we move through the decade in a growing economy? My perspective is yes: companies will continue restructuring and the entire employment environment will be very fluid. The balancing act of keeping people and managing compensation will be a vital skill for successful business leaders. <br />The book begins with a recognition that layoffs, easy as they may be as a simple solution, may not always be the best answer. Chapter 1 opens with Key Principles, a good positioning that continues as a pattern through the book. Downsizing is explained in short sections in a style that reminds me of USA Today-short, pithy statements. The practicality of the book jumps out with numbered how-to steps to follow. You won't find a lot of depth here, but rather pragmatic thought stimulators. This book will be most valuable for people with experience and/or knowledge in human resource management practices. <br />The second chapter reports on what companies are doing to cut costs and keep people. The chapter reports on the responses of 1,245 companies to a 2001 survey. Results are reported, followed by the sort of summary that appears at the end of each chapter. The first section concludes with a chapter on how leadership can maintain morale during the kind of crisis that inspires downsizing. <br />Part Two moves from dilemma to solution, providing seven steps to cut compensation costs. Readers will find an easy-to-read format (plenty of space between lines-airy). A wealth of ideas is shared in these pages as you move from preparation to planning to implementation, to getting back to business. <br />Then comes the frosting on the cake: five appendices, a glossary, and a good index. Two sample employment termination agreements are offered, one for individual workers 40 and older and another for more than one worker over 40. We're into the legal cover-your-anatomy stuff here. The other three appendices are quite unusual. They're sample speeches for corporate leaders to use in announcing rounds 1, 2, and 3 of cost cutting. I wondered about this feature, thinking that this must be Cost Cutting for Real Dummies.<BR>There is some value in the sample speeches as readers will gain some insight into the issues that need to be covered. However, leaders should be encouraged to use their own phraseology and creativity so their own personality comes through to their people. <br />As lead author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People,\\"  I believe that we will soon move into an era of increasing headcounts, we're not quite there yet. So this book has instant value today, and will have philosophical and procedural value into the future.	2003-03-07

US	52870090	R328ANOSYAVQV2	1578516579	57097658	The Company of the Future	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Insightful, Thought Provoking, Great Read	As a futurist, concentrating on workforce and workplace trends, I was eager to read this book. The author is the Management Editor at The Economist magazine and resides in London. Interesting...British author published by Harvard. I discovered that the book very effectively bridges American and British concerns, and much more. It's a global look, even in the generic sense of the word, at what companies will look like in the years ahead. The metamorphosis will be evolutionary, but many of the concepts of tomorrow will be revolutionary compared to where most employers are today. <br />The organization of this book-the chapters and the order in which they're presented, reveals the emphasis Cairncross believes will characterize companies in the future. Right out of the box, she focuses on management, information, and technology. Throughout the book, she observes that the development and increasing use of the internet will change the way we do business. The importance of knowledge, decision making, and innovation are emphasized early on, along with recognition of the vitality of customers and brands in the years ahead. <br />The human side of enterprise is well covered, though Cairncross doesn't really engage this topic until chapter 4. Since my personal bias is that people are the most important component, I found this curious, but then noticed how she concentrated on different parts of this aspect in chapter 4 (Recruiting, Retaining, and Training), chapter 5 (Communities and Corporate Culture), chapter 8 (Corporate Structure), and chapter 9 (Leading and Managing). So, the field is well-covered in these interwoven chapters, but her book organization puts people just a step behind information, innovation, and technology. <br />Chapters on purchasing and strategic suppliers bring out the growing importance of alliances and new relationships in the company of the future. <br />In the beginning of the book, Cairncross suggests that readers with time constraints read chapters one and ten first to gain a perspective of her views. When more time is available, the reader can delve into the other chapters. While that strategy would be effective, there is a richness of potent observation, vivid warnings of challenges to come, and a plethora of thoughts to stimulate your thinking throughout the book. <br />The Company of the Future is quite well-written, as you might expect from an editor of an internationally-acclaimed magazine. This is the kind of book you'll want to read first, then share with colleagues in your own organization...and in organizations where you have existing or developing alliance relationships. The book has an index, notes, and readable text-no graphs, pictures, or other tools of book designers. This one is pure, welcome, high-grade content.	2003-03-01

The whole concept of quality leadership seems to be a foreign concept to many of the people charged with the responsibility of running organizations-whether those organizations are multi-national conglomerates, discrete departments, or a mom-and-pop store down on the corner. <br />Geist begins, aptly enough, by defining leadership and the interconnectivity of the leader, people, skills, and vision. Chapter two gets us right into self-awareness and the need to manage your own emotions more effectively. Management is logical; leadership is emotional. As we move through this chapter, we slide from one set of advice to another. Ten Steps to Develop Accurate Self-Perception is followed by topics like relationships and human behavior principles, trust, and self-control. <br />Chapter 3 explores the people aspect of the interconnectivity model. What are people looking for? What's the most effective way to deliver it to them? We learn how to meet employee expectations with praise, recognition, mentoring, work-life balance, and inspiration. Chapter four emphasizes skill development, beginning with the hiring process to be sure you have the right people on board. Team building, time management, delegation, conflict resolution, and decision making are addressed, providing insight into the fundamental skills that build leadership success. <br />Chapter five deviates from the four components of interconnectivity to address the all-important communication skills. The basics are all here-writing, speaking, reading, non-verbal. Chapter 6 returns to the model with a focus on the vision and how to move an organization forward. Innovation, change, culture development, and execution are discussed.  A summary chapter reminds us that we're all still human, and that humanness is a vital part of leadership.<br />There is a series of \\"tough questions\\" at the end of each chapter, with some blanks for you to recordyour answers in workbook fashion. Insightful and inspiring quotations are sprinkled throughout the text. An index is included for later reference.<br />This is a good primer for supervisors or people without management experience. It's a broad and shallow survey of the myriad of concerns that face leaders. In the space available, Geist does not go into great depth in any of the topics; you'll find that penetration in other books. This is also not one of those books that will rock you to your very foundations and make you uncomfortable. It's a good starter book for people moving into leadership in corporate, non-profit, or civic organizations. The principles are universal, and essential for people moving up the leadership ladder.	2003-02-24

This book is designed for the times, when so many marketers are concerned about how to get their message out by electronic mail--a lot cheaper than the alternative offered by the United States Postal Service. Benefit: at least e-mail gets through; unfortunately, a lot of bulk mail has not made it to addressees over the years.<br />So what's different about the electronic approach, other than the method of distribution? Don't you still need great copy and an effective target list of potential buyers? <br />There are a lot of similarities between electronic and postal direct mail, so you'll read chapters on words and phrases that work and don't work. You'll still get the advice on how to construct your message to grab the attention of the recipient. This immediate attention issue is even more acute with e-mail: hitting the DELETE button is a lot quicker than handling a piece of mail, opening it or not, and tossing it in the trash. <br />Lewis has tailored this book nicely to this new medium, exploring how to adapt to this communications vehicle without getting burned. Chapters discuss opt-ins, avoiding the \\"spam\\" accusation, and how to use the e-mail subject line most effectively. He explores how to establish rapport through e-mail, using personalization and psychology to elicit the desired response. The chapter on rich media and viral mail is certainly something you won't find in a typical marketing book.<br />This book is filled with medium-specific information, quelling my fear that this would be just another marketing book with \\"E-Mail\\" dropped in the front of the title. These pages are a treasure-trove of resources and tailored advice. The ten pages of tips at the end of the book supplement the tips that appear on the pages throughout the text. An abundance of examples illustrate the author's points. Indexed.	2003-02-23

The content and the style inspired me to spread the good word before I finished the book. I forced myself to wait, and was continually delighted with what I gleaned from each page.<br />The world of work is changing-dramatically and quickly. Few people really \\"get\\" what is happening, let alone what to do about it. In my work as a Consulting Business Futurist, I face a daily challenge of motivating leaders to open up, shift their perspective, and begin to function differently than they ever have before. I'm almost embarrassed that I didn't write \\"Work 2.0,\\" but still will have no difficulty at all in recommending it to my clients. I'll also recommend it to corporate executives who are not yet enlightened enough to become clients! Reading this book will shake them up enough to do something. <br />The message of this book is powerful, direct, and in-your-face. It's compelling; you won't want to put this book down. Employees are becoming more demanding-they want recognition, respect, empowerment, and all the rest, but with a different twist and different intensity than we've ever seen. Have you read the books about disruptive events that change history? Jensen closes-after the endnotes, acknowledgements, subject index, and people index-with a list of 55 disruptive events. Number 55 is 9/11/2001. And more has happened since then. You, dear reader, will be part of the sequel. It's unavoidable.<br />Corporate leaders: Read this book. Now, before your competitors do. Human resource professionals: \\"Work 2.0\\" will unsettle you and stimulate you to advise management in a whole new way. Allow me to quote from the FAQ page at the end of the book. \\"Dear Loony Author: Are you nuts? Have you read the papers? Employees are in no position to ask for anything but breadcrumbs. As far as I'm concerned, there's no way the My-Way is coming our way. Sincerely, Exec-in-Charge.\\" Jensen heard this message from senior executives, just as we have. Executives excited about being back in control as the economy slowed. <br />Guess what! The economy's picking up. As we report in our book, \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People\\" (also available from amazon.com), employers are moving into the most severe shortage of skilled labor in history. Employees will be in the driver's seat again. The new contract with employees, described in vivid detail in \\"Work 2.0,\\" is being written now-by workers, not by employers. Executives who don't get the message of this book risk being written out of the contract.<br />The choice is yours.	2003-02-23

Begin with one respected professor of psychology from Arizona State University. Sweeten with Regents Chair and Distinguished Graduate Research Faculty distinction. Mix in comments from readers of previous editions (\\"we get mail\\"). Fold in pop psychology twist and plenty of examples. Season to taste with just enough irreverence to spice up the text. Bake with three previous editions, improving on each version. Absorb and chill for 262 pages and gain a deep, fun, yet realistic understanding of how humans influence each other.<br />Marketers will benefit tremendously from this book. So will executives, managers, business owners, students, and everyone who has an interest in how we are influenced to make decisions. Those decisions may affect what we buy, where we work and live, and what relationships we have with others. The illustrations sprinkled throughout the volume offset the small print used to cram a tremendous amount of content into a book that is small enough not to be intimidating. No wonder over a quarter million copies have been sold. It's an Everyman's book on the topic, yet it's an academic treatise as well, with 16 pages of references preceding the index. <br />Each chapter includes a summary and study questions-both on content and to stimulate critical thinking. All those features you'd want in a book like this are all there, waiting for you. Expect to curl up with this book, nod your head, laugh, shake your head, and wonder in amazement while gaining insight. Cialdini grabs your attention and won't let go. Expect to make notes, write in margins, underline or highlight, and repeat your reading. <br />Readers of \\"Influence\\" will look differently at the world around them. Even if you merely scan through this book, you'll gain a new appreciation for advertising, group behavior, and even how you're treated by salespeople, co-workers, bosses, parents and friends. The conscious and unconscious heightened awareness will be well worth the time and money you invest in this book.	2003-02-17

Do we need another one? How will this book be any different, any better?<br />As I opened the cover and began reading the introduction, I felt very comfortable. There's a human quality to this author's writing style that invites you to keep turning pages. Land shared the story of his experience building a team within a United States Air Force squadron during the Viet Nam War. As I learned of the results he achieved, my interest was piqued. <br />Land is a Certified Management Consultant with a wide range of engagements under his belt. He relates some of his experiences as we move through the book, teaching and sharing in a style that is more conversational than preachy. How refreshing! He even cites work done by other experts in the field, demonstrating that he's writing to help the reader instead of pumping his own self-worth. <br />You'll read six chapters, taking you from an understanding of terms and concepts into organizational and team values. Chapter 4 explores the transition from traditional to team values, followed by a chapter of the role of conflict in the process. In chapter 6, our helpful consultant takes us through a Team Building Process that Really Works. Five appendices provide tools for leaders to use in building teams in their organizations. <br />After reading this book, you'll have a different perspective and confidence about what can be done. Apply what you've learned and you'll build higher results similar to what Land built with the Air Force squadron when he began the process he helps us understand. You'll find the book quite engaging; I was surprised how quickly I moved through the pages, enjoying the experience.	2003-02-16
US	52870090	R289TOYX559CHM	1561708461	706488190	The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children	Books	5	170	187	N	N	Heavy on the Spiritual	Indigo children, a recognized group among today's young people, have been diagnosed, studied, and supported by psychologists, educators, and lay people. Born after 1978, they are described as bright, intuitive, strong-willed, and sometimes self-destructive individuals. I learned about them from some educators I served in a consulting capacity and read \\"The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived\\" by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. I learned a lot from that book and found myself wanting more. That drive led me to this book.<br />Compared to \\"The Indigo Children\\", this book fell short of my expectations. Because of the author's strong spiritual leaning, the topics, content, and treatment went much further into angels and prayers than it did into how to work practically with these special young people. Perhaps I should have expected this when I saw the author's photo on the back cover. It's a rather unusual shot of a woman in a forest with a Koala bear and she does not appear to have clothes on. Different kind of author photo than I'm accustomed to.<br />Virtue is described as a PhD \\"spiritual doctor of psychology.\\" She's heavily invested in angels (author of \\"Healing with Angels\\"), which is quite obvious in the book. There is significant text devoted to angels, prayers, and the evils of pharmaceuticals like Ritalin. Some readers may find the pre-written prayers helpful for them. My Indigo step-daughter was less than enthusiastic about prescriptions for communicating with spirits, though the book suggests that some Indigos are really into that sort of experience.<br />The book includes a number of valuable tips about diet, concentration, and overcoming insomnia. I would have personally preferred more emphasis on these practical techniques than the heavy spiritual component and astrological comments. If you are into the spiritual, you'll enjoy this book, becoming immersed in all of its aspects. If you are not so spiritual, you'll still find some worthwhile concrete ideasand techniques interwoven in the text.	2003-02-10

We followed Sheriff Taylor, Barney, Aunt Bea, and the rest through 249 episodes from 1960 through 1968.  From 1968 through 1971, we were treated to 78 episodes of Mayberry RFD. Watching these shows today is a heartwarming nostalgic experience. Why, there's even an active The Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club!<br />Mayberry has its roots firmly and deeply planted in Mt. Airy, North Carolina, a small town nestled in the mountains between Winston-Salem and the Virginia state line. Andy Griffith is celebrated there, along with all the traditions of hometown America, during community festivals and other events. <br />Jewell Kutzer grew up in Mayberry, just a couple of years behind Andy Griffith. She shares many of the memories that inspired Griffith to create Mayberry and the character of the popular television show. In Memories of Mayberry, she shares her experiences growing up in this now-famous small town. It's a pleasant, comfortable book to read, like having a conversation with a friend. Mt. Airy was a microcosm of life in a changing country, in a changing world. Lives were interwoven with the lives of others in the community. People were real, they were caring neighbors, they led simpler lives in the 1940s and 1950s. This book takes the reader back to those uncomplicated times.<br />Did I say uncomplicated? Well, compared to today's complex lifestyles. But for Jewell, growing up in a small town, life brought one adventure after another. Her tales of yesteryear are referenced to episodes in The Andy Griffith Show that relate to the memories. Readers will gain a deeper appreciation of how Griffith made the show so real in the earlier days of television.<br />Want a trip back to our roots? To the values on which our country was built? Pick up a copy of Memories of Mayberry to open your mind and heart to our wonderful past, not just in Mt.Airy, but in hundreds of other small towns across the land. Definitely designed for readers over 40 (we were there), but offers valuable insights for younger readers, too.	2003-01-20

There are plenty of books on this topic, since public speaking is consistently rated the experience that frightens us most. Statistically, people would rather die in a plane crash than give a speech. Giving a speech is not terminal, so if we gain some good advice about how to do it, we can overcome the fear and become more effective.<br />So why this book instead of all the other fine books that have been written on the topic? I suggest there are three reasons to choose \\"Speak with Confidence.\\" <br />When I pick up a non-fiction book, particularly a how-to book, I want to see some author credibility. What gives this person the right to write this book? Dianna Booher is a Certified Speaking Professional with a considerable amount of platform experience. \\"Successful Meetings\\" magazine identifies her as one of the Top 21 Speakers for the 21st Century. Here's a classic case of \\"been there, done that.\\"<br />The second thing I look for in this kind of a book is readability. Is the book designed in such a way that I can grasp the concepts without getting bogged down in a morass of irrelevant and confusing text? I was delighted with the way \\"Speak with Confidence\\" is put together. There are 16 chapters to organize the information, but the tips are presented in numbered paragraphs-497 of them! Whew! The table of contents design, combined with the list of tips in the back of the book, makes it easy to get to the knowledge you want. <br />The third criterion for me is content. Is there good solid material? Can the reader really learn something? This book is jam-packed with information that is easily accessible and presented in a way that helps the reader. The author weaves in some of her own experiences to juice up the presentation, but these pages are filled with in-depth advice. Even after ten years in Toastmasters and 23 years speaking professionally, I found myself learning new ideas while refreshing things I knew. <br />Special gift idea: every up-and-coming corporate leader will benefit from reading this book and practicing the principles that are presented. Building the ability to speak before groups will put you miles ahead of your peers. This book will help get you there.	2003-01-18

He's a superior innovator. No, he's a research-based stimulator who helps corporate executives innovate and follow-through to sell their products and services at high profits. You could be one of those successful corporate executives if you read this book and follow the abundant advice. <br />You're not a big-shot executive of a major well-funded corporation? Not a problem. Hall's specialty is helping small companies (97 percent of American companies earn less than $1 million in revenue in a year) achieve greatness. Yes, he works with large clients like Mattel, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Pepsi-Cola, Tyson Food Service, and John Hancock Insurance. The learning he gleans from them is then shared with smaller companies as Hall enjoys his role as a modern-day corporate Robin Hood. His readers are the beneficiaries of his knowledge, insight, and experience. <br />If you've read marketing books, some of Hall's urgings will sound familiar. He's a self- admitted follower of marketing guru David Ogilvy. But, that's just the beginning. Hall will take you to the next level. Before I even finished the book, I was re-writing my firm's marketing messages. <br />In the first part of the book, Hall delves into what he calls the Three Laws of Marketing Physics. You'll learn about Overt Benefit, Reason to Believe, and Dramatic Difference. The concepts presented will awaken your thinking and fuel your idea generator. This section is valuable for readers who need to understand the principles that underlie what Hall prescribes. The second section jumps into the nitty-gritty, exploring the Three Laws of Capitalist Creativity: Explore Stimuli, Leverage Diversity, and Face Fears. <br />In addition to the inspiring flow of material in the chapters themselves, you'll find value in the frequently asked questions sections, the bibliography, and the index-which you'll probably use liberally as you convertthe book from a good read to a powerful tool. Think you know a lot of this stuff already? Take the Quick Quiz at the start of the book and you'll discover there's more to learn. Doug Hall will be your teacher.	2002-12-31

The motley group includes professional researchers and prognosticators, academics, corporate strategists, and amateur futurists who like to engage their keen interest in trends and their implications.<br />This book is a collection of papers prepared for the 1999 gathering, the Ninth General Assembly, marking the 33d anniversary of the founding of the Society. In 1999, a large portion of our population was, to one extent or another, contemplating what the next century might hold. There are, of course, a wide range of views on an even wider range of aspects to be considered. Much of the future cannot yet be determined, but we can combine today's knowledge with expectations about the directions events and science may take us.<br />Frontiers of the 21st Century presents twenty independent perspectives on what we may see and experience in the years ahead. The chapters, each written by a different respected futurist, are organized into three sections: Likely Developments with Universal Ramifications in the New Millennium, The Creative Utilization of Human Capital, and Futurist Observations on a New Millennium. While the treatise is admittedly not a fully comprehensive view of all the variables of our future, the articles presented are thought-provoking and stimulating.<br />As might be expected in this kind of a work, the articles are also more academic than what we might describe as popular reading. Getting through this book will not be easy; it will take time. But, then again, the creation of the ideas and their expression took time, too. There is a lot of material here for serious futurists, for academics, and for the many thoughtful people who enjoy considering what might happen in our lives and the lives of our descendants. There are few illustrations; the book is primarily text to be absorbed.<br />If I were rating this volume as a book for the general public, I'd give it low marks. The presentation is not exciting and intriguing enough to capture the attention of the general reader. For the audience for which it is intended, the book has quite a bit to offer.	2002-12-22

Books	4	2	2	N	N	A portable motivational seminar	When 25 percent of students who enter the ninth grade don't complete high school four years later, we have a problem. What's the cause of this malaise? Why aren't our children learning? Home environment? No, parents are wonderful. The kids? Certainly not, they're little angels. Must be the teachers!<br />Teachers are much-maligned these days, usually by people who have no conception of the multiple challenges of a teacher's life. The job of a teacher-in a school system-can be exhausting, intimidating, frustrating, etc. etc. (I make the \\"school system\\" distinction because, in reality, we are all teachers. From that perspective, there is value in this book for people like store owners, manufacturing supervisors, and warehouse managers.) There are many factors that can work against a teacher's success in the classroom and in the career. These factors can easily lead to low performance, job burnout, lackadaisical attitudes. A good dose of motivation from someone who's \\"been there\\" could have some value. <br />This book was written by former teacher Jerry King, now a motivational speaker and trainer. Essentially, it sounds like it might be his motivational seminar in written form. He urges readers to follow the book through step-by-step, reading the chapters in the order presented . . . just like following the flow of a seminar. There are a number of places where readers are asked to respond to questions, to write down their thoughts, just like in a workshop. The pages are filled with a cornucopia of inspirational stories, anecdotes, and humor that will be familiar to a number of readers. All those pearls of wisdom are collected in these pages,  all the treasures in one box. <br />King professes six \\"dynamic strategies of highly successful teachers,\\" from self-image to classroom performance. A ten-day personal plan of action follows the instructional/inspirational strategy chapters. <br />At times, the book seems a bit shallow, but most readers of this book would probably have difficulty with greater depth to grasp the concepts presented. The four-quadrant behavioral system, DiSC, is included, looking at teachers' behavioral style as well as students'. This kind of information can be interesting, particularly when delivered in an interactive workshop format. I'm skittish when I see it woven into a book like that, because the coverage is minimal and other vital aspects of the human dynamic are not covered. Life just isn't this simplistic.<br />The structure, the design, of the book is a bit less professional than what might be found with a book produced by a larger publishing house, but the content is valuable. Teachers reading these pages will gain some reinforcement, some reenergizing, that will inspire them to remember the significance of their work. Recommended for teachers-and principals-looking for some light motivational reading, particularly if read with an image of being in one of the author's workshops, learning from a dedicated and experienced teacher who believes in the vitality of the teaching profession.	2002-12-15

If the cash flow isn't there, if the revenue isn't there, the business probably won't be there. Entrepreneurs, especially in start-up mode, are concerned about sales, cash flow, and profit---on the business side of the ledger. All that is important, but if the owner doesn't take care of the personal side as well, success will be shallow, fragile, and fleeting. <br />Here's a book that gives you more answers than you want to hear. If you're an entrepreneur (own your own business), you may be in stage 1 (start-up and early days), stage 2 (stable and on a clear path to profitability) or stage 3 (profitable, stable cash flow, mature). In each phase, you have personal financial issues as well as corporate finance issues to address. You'll have a lot of questions looking for answers.<br />What better expert to counsel you than the researcher and journalist who gained so much popularity as finance editor of Inc. Magazine and editor at Bloomberg Personal Finance. She's been a writer at Forbes, the New York Times, and the Wall Street columnist for the New York Observer. As you can imagine, Jill Fraser knows her topic well. She presents a tremendous amount of highly valuable information and advice in succinct doses that always seem to be just the right length. Reading this book is like sitting in that comfortable chair in your living room chatting with a knowledgeable friend.<br />Want more? Fraser has brought a dozen well-known successful entrepreneurs to the party. They share their perspectives throughout the book, in focused commentary at the end of each section. I was impressed with the thoroughness of this book.<br />Want more? How about an eight page index in the back of the book and a full-page index of hot topics in the front of the book? As you turn the pages, you'll find more little surprises as the author keeps delivering even more than you expect. I'd recommend this book for every business owner, regardless of your stage of development . . . as well as for people who are contemplating going into business for themselves. Wish I'd had this book twenty years ago!	2002-12-08

If I have an interest in the subject, I'll accept a review copy, but without any guarantee that I'll review it. No guarantees: it's an ethical thing. <br />The author contacted me about this book, several times. Having a long-term passing interest in UFOs and extra-terrestrials, I agreed to take a look at the book. My first temptation, as I began my review process, was to discard Voron's book and move on to the other books that await me. However, in the interest of fairness and as an alert to readers in this genre, I'll give you my perspective.<br />The book was produced by PublishAmerica. There is no publisher's address or phone number in the book, merely a statement that they're in Baltimore. [Checking their website, which also has no address, I discovered that they're really closer to Frederick, Maryland.] This book is barely a step above self-publishing, and I've seen self-published books put together considerably better than this one is. The table of contents doesn't even have page numbers to find the chapters. <br />To take any book on this topic seriously, we need to know something about the author, the author's perspective, and the methodology involved in putting the manuscript together. None of that information is provided. No, not even a page telling us who Der Veron is. We have a validity problem going in.<br />The book describes various UFO stories, relates media accounts, and cites reports by pilots and officials. The only position I was able to discern in the book is that the author believes that UFOs and extraterrestrials exist. The writing lacks consistency, clarity, and even accurate grammar. PublishAmerica's editorial work was insufficient. <br />The book is filled with assumptions that seem to go far beyond the scholarly work done in this field. Conjecture is mixed with creative science fiction, delivering a garbled message that is inconsistent and poorly organized. If you're looking for a solid manuscript on this topic, look somewhere else. <br />[Sorry, Mr. or Ms. Veron. You're probably not excited about this review, but this is the risk you take when you publish a book and ask for a reviewer's opinion.]	2002-12-07

She's served as an editor for Inc. Magazine and Bloomberg Personal Finance. She knows how to write in a style that grabs and holds a reader's attention. I went straight through cover-to-cover with this book, turning pages and turning down pages.<br />After several years of research, this book was assembled to tell the story of the nightmare that has been the life of the white collar worker in America in recent decades. Using an enticing mixture of facts and figures and real-life stories collected from people in the trenches, Fraser documents a story that cries for exposure. White collar employees from large companies will recognize-painfully-the picture that's painted, with personal histories and company names and practices illuminating the text. Page after page reveals the details of an embarrassingly destructive period in our country's corporate history. Sadly, the story continues, with complications and far-reaching implications, far beyond what's presented in White Collar Sweatshop.<br />You'll experience a wide range of emotions as you move through this factual report. Those emotions will range from pity to sympathy, from empathy to rage. Using the internet, Fraser found a wide range of people to open their hearts, share their experiences, and expose the questionable, unfeeling, almost inhumane acts of corporate executives. You'll read about people who invested their lives, at the expense of their families and themselves, to help build companies that later chewed them up and spit them out. <br />The research for this book was conducted during the late 1990s and into 2000. These were the years of the hot economy where opportunities to change jobs were plentiful. Many of the people who worked for large corporations, where this book is centered, did not leave for greener pastures; they were trapped in a never-ending cycle of working, working, working for companies-emotional and professional handcuffs that held them in a no-alternatives, no-win rut. <br />Since this book was written, the economy has shifted. During the slowdown of 2000-2002, employers became even more ruthless. With fewer jobs to jump to, workers had their escape routes blocked. The current reality is probably even worse than the deterioration described in Fraser's documentary. As the economy picks up, we'll see some cataclysmic changes in the relationship between employers and employees. The historical period recorded in this book will be a foundation for a major upheaval. <br />To understand what's coming, read this book to understand what's happened. Special note to senior corporate executives: If you want to attract, inspire, and optimize top talent, read this book to comprehend how your employees feel. Even if you're not the size of the major companies cited in the case histories, know that your future or even current employees-directly or indirectly-are influenced by the experiences described. <br />This book will be a catalyst for change if corporate leaders apply the knowledge they'll gain to assure that sweatshop practices are terminated.<br />Extra benefits: strong notes section with a number of valuable book references, as well as a comprehensive index.	2002-12-02

I read it cover-to-cover in one sitting, finding myself drawn from one chapter to the next. Parents of \\"problem children\\" will find an exciting hope and insight in these pages. Savvy educators will be elated, challenged, and stimulated to teach differently. Therapists, doctors, and social workers will gain new windows through which to view their clients, with a host of new solutions. Employers: Indigo children are growing up and will soon move into the workplace. For wise, sensitive, individually-focused employers, these employees will be a special treasure. For others, they will be a mystery...and will soon be gone.<br />Carroll and Tober, who kept hearing about Indigo children in their work as self-help counselors and lecturers, knew nothing about the topic. They felt that a book needed to be written, so they wove their ignorance, amazement, curiosity, and receptivity into a delightful journey. From the very beginning of the book, they wove in presentations by a wide range of experts to tell the story. Reading this volume is like being in the audience at a seminar where a panel of experts is delivering knowledge, perspective, and experience just for you.<br />What is an Indigo Child? Definition: \\"one who displays a new and unusual set of psychological attributes and shows a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before.\\" Common traits include coming into the world with a feeling of royalty, having a feeling of \\"deserving to be here,\\" a high level of self-worth, difficulty with absolute authority, a reluctance to do certain things, frustration with routine that doesn't require creative thought, searching for better ways to do things-not conforming to the \\"system,\\" antisocial (especially in school), lack of response to guilt discipline, and open in declaring what they need. The color aspect of the name came from the work of Nancy Ann Tappe, quoted effectively in the book.<br />The first chapter, appropriately, defines and explains the Indigo Child. Chapter Two delivers solutions: What Can You Do? Surprise-no build-up to bestow solutions at the end of the manuscript; it's right up front. Chapter three explores the spiritual aspects of the Indigos, a fascinating perspective even for those of us who consciously resist \\"woo-woo.\\" Health issues are discussed in chapter four, revealing the challenges of mis-diagnoses by physicians who are focused on symptoms without understanding causes. The book closes with messages from several Indigos who have grown out of their childhood and can relate to their experience from their perspective as adults. <br />The book is filled with references for further reading and learning. Carroll and Tober have given us a springboard to understanding.	2002-12-01

This one focuses on branding, an area that has been misunderstood and misused for years-by some impressive companies. It's quite an educational experience to see how marketing giants stubbed their toes by violating one or more of Reis' Laws.<br />Why focus on branding? According to the authors, \\"Marketing is brand building. The two concepts are so inextricably linked that it's impossible to separate them. Furthermore, since everything a company does can contribute to the brand-building process, marketing is not a function that can be considered in isolation.\\" The branding concept should be of interest, therefore, to every executive and manager. <br />The book itself is unique. It's a slightly different size than the typical 6 X 9 business book. It's a paperback and very lightweight. HarperBusiness has produced a book that's so light, you can tuck it in your briefcase to carry a book with you without it being a burden. And the cover is orange. When's the last time you saw an orange business book? You might expect this book to be a bit contrarian, in your face, and maybe even a little disrespectful of all those marketing giants. You won't be disappointed. It's plainly written, not complicated, and may even appear simplistic at times.<br />The first part of this book presents chapter after chapter, explaining each of the 22 laws and giving examples of how companies have complied with or violated the laws in creating their brands. The authors pull no punches, providing evidence about how brands have won or lost, how they have built or destroyed companies, based on their understanding and application of Ries' Laws. The experiences shared can serve as valuable lessons to any company of any size.<br />The book as it is titled is finished at page 110. At that point, the authors take us on a journey through The 11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding. This is a bonus you wouldn't expect, since it's not referenced in the title. There is a small-print reference on the cover, but these hints don't do justice the 125 pages of internet-focused content. With more space devoted to the emerging issues of internet branding, you can imagine the depth and challenging commentary you'll find in this half of the book. A comprehensive index completes the book.<br />This book will raise some eyebrows and perhaps embarrass a few anonymous marketing managers who made costly errors. More importantly, readers equipped with the knowledge and insight from this book will have a better chance of doing the right thing with their brand development in the future. Read this book before making any branding decisions and save yourself a lot of grief . . . and money.	2002-11-30

The design of the book is unique, as are some of the ideas. If you're ready and receptive, this book could be helpful to you. <br />Let's look at the inspiration side first. And it is inspiration \\"side.\\" The right hand pages of the book, differentiated by a purple border, are the inspirational book. The story is intriguing, though it stretches the imagination at times. Several important messages are included, such as teamwork, networking, creativity, and tenacity. A literature critic could probably tear the story apart, but, like Celestine Prophesy, it conveys the authors' theme. The reader's thoughts are stimulated, pulled along with curiosity about what happens next, then massaged with the idea that the story line-though a stretch-is not impossible. <br />The left-hand pages of the book are a step-by-step process, a methodology. Some of the content has been around before, but bears repeating. Parts of this section seem a bit contrived, but the reader can still pick up the gist of the message.  <br />Are there any guarantees? No. Is there enough here to provoke your thinking, and perhaps your action, to increase your wealth. Yes. Will everyone who reads this book \\"get\\" the message and take action? No. This book needs to be taken in context as a stimulator with no guarantees. The authors are both millionaires; through the ups and downs of life, they've made it. <br />At the start of this review, I used the word \\"platform.\\" What you learn in these pages can be a platform for your financial [and spiritual (tithing is recommended)] growth. Engaging with the authors will also give them a platform to sell you seminars, follow-up learning tools, and more. They invite you several times to their website. If you take them up on this offer, expect to hear from them on a regular basis. While this process will probably help Hansen and Allen to increase their wealth while helping others, it may also give some readers more ideas on what they can do. <br />My thoughts were stimulated, though I found the one-side of the page reading to be a bit distracting. I don't know that I'll follow the paths the authors recommend, but I'm thinking more about more clearly mapping and treading my own path.	2002-11-25

Many of them have actually gone beyond talking and are on the quest. The Balancing Act is one of a number of books that have been written (and will be written) on this topic. Seivert, a business consultant and executive coach, has put together a design that suggests five areas that need to be brought into an appropriate balance for you: Personal Life, Relationships, Leadership, Organizations, and World.<br />Various chapters of this book are keyed to the five elements; others are presented as being of general interest to the reader. This approach and book organization (the chapters are coded in the table of contents) enables the reader to concentrate, during first or subsequent readings, on those areas of greatest interest. Two appendices and an index provide additional support.<br />The book is organized into three parts: Finding Your Balance in Life, Relationships, and Work; The Five Elements of Success; and The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts. The first section, pre-chapters, offers almost three dozen pages of introductory material on Finding Your Balance, The Elements of Success, and The Great Ally Inside You. Readers will find a collection of worksheets to engage in some self-analysis before proceeding into the meat of the book.<br />The text is heavy on spirituality, as opposed to books focused on life activities and common sense advice. Seivert's elements: air, fire, water, and earth are discussed in the context of balancing them in the way you lead your life. If you are receptive to a deep spiritual approach to life, you'll enjoy this book. If you are not engaged by this approach, it will be difficult to connect with this presentation.	2002-11-20
US	52870090	RNUG0OUIWJ94W	0814407455	738420029	Laugh and Learn: 95 Ways to Use Humor for More Effective Teaching and Training	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A Bit Shallow	While it contains a lot of good ideas, this book will not make the list of books every trainer should read to be successful. Tamblyn pulls together a number of proven training techniques and principles, but the book lacks the depth of numerous other books in the field. <br />The author is a former comedienne turned trainer, with her seminal experience at the state of California's school for errant drivers. Not exactly a corporate setting, but she had engaged in training in the corporate world for over two decades.<br />Tamblyn tries to be funny and mix in research on humor and deliver training tips all at the same time. Is this a training book or a humor book? I'm not enthusiastic about either objective being accomplished well, particularly compared with other work in the field that has greater depth and value. <br />In the introduction, as Tamblyn begins the lightness of the book's style, I read, \\"Therefore, I herewith offer this personal guarantee: If you don't laugh at least once while reading this book, I will eat a raw Japanese sea urchin. I swear. All you have to do is write.\\" As a serious reviewer, even noting her lighthearted treatment of her topic, I wondered more than once how much she likes raw Japanese sea urchins.<br />The AMACOM editors have contributed by supporting some good organization to the book, including an index of the 95 techniques immediately following the table of contents and acknowledgements. Each chapter ends with a pause for reflection (write in the spaces provided what you got from this chapter) and a Next Steps section. Techniques presented in the book are tied back to theoretical introductions with side notes on the pages and readers are supplied with call-out quotes to read throughout the book. <br />The author and editors attempted to accomplish several things in one volume, but didn't make a sufficient connection or case, in my opinion. There is some value here for less experienced trainers, but such readers might be better servedby the writings of Bob Pike and Leslie Yerkes. If you are active in the field already, this book may be a disappointment.	2002-11-17

Too many companies are populated by people who can't think for themselves and, worse, by people who can think but don't. Today, when brainpower is so critical to an organization's success, we limit ourselves by doing some really stupid things. <br />If that statement sounds a little brash, challenging, critical, and accurate, you ain't seen nothin' yet! After a quarter century of consulting to all sorts of organizations around the world, Karl Albrecht has earned an enviable reputation---and the bully pulpit to tell it like it is. His messages (and the book is filled with them) need to be heard by people in charge of today's departments, divisions, companies, agencies, and other organizations. We call these people \\"leaders,\\" but in truth most are really managers or even administrators in leaders' clothing. Their ignorance, ineptitude, and avoidable blunders inhibit performance. <br />Leaders need to learn more about leadership. They need to understand leadership in its current context and, at the same time, appreciate how we arrived at this place on our journey. They need to appreciate their role, especially the importance of inspiring and supporting people to use their minds. Creativity? Yes, but an amazing proportion of workers can't---or won't---even think for themselves, limiting their potential for achievement. <br />Consider Albrecht's Law: \\"Intelligent people, when assembled into an organization, will tend toward collective stupidity.\\" It's Dilbert ® come to life. Albrecht's assertion is that leveraging the intelligence of an organization can determine the difference between \\"smart\\" companies and \\"dumb\\" companies. In our increasingly competitive employment environment, companies that allow themselves to be \\"dumb\\" (or even just dumber than the competition) may be doomed to extinction. The differentiating factor is leadership, and how well that leadership can utilize the individual and collective intelligence ofthe organization's members.<br />This book will grab your attention in the preface and you'll find yourself wanting to keep turning the pages to absorb the knowledge delivered, sometimes irreverently, by the author. Each chapter is filled with insights of past, present, and possibilities that will add to the vital comprehension of how the quality of thinking can help or hinder achievement. A liberal sprinkling of examples, aptly called \\"Case in Point,\\" bring principles and experiences to life in each chapter. A set of Key Indicators closes each chapter, giving the reader a handy checklist to apply the knowledge gained. This design is very user-friendly.<br />The first two chapters make the case for smarter organizations. The second section of the book explores Organizational Intelligence, focusing on strategic vision, shared fate, appetite for change, earning discretionary energy, alignment and congruence, knowledge development, and performance pressure. The last two chapters offer the reader some serious guidance in how to make their organizations smarter. Notes at the end of each chapter and a comprehensive 12-page index add value.<br />The Power of Minds at Work covers a lot of landscape. It's comprehensive, yet delves into sufficient depth to satisfy some of the thought stimulated by his commentary. Yes, you read that sentence correctly: some of your thought will be satisfied. Reading this book will inspire you to go further. Wise leaders will absorb the book, then invite their co-leaders to read and discuss Albrecht's messages....and apply the wisdom that emerges. The content in these pages will generate some rich, productive conversations.<br />Reviewer's Note: As author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Not Enough People,\\" a wake-up call about the shortage of skilled labor in this decade, I urge corporate executives to sharpen their skills in leadership and drawing more from their people. \\"The Power of Minds at Work\\" is an excellent tool to build this strength.	2002-11-09

No, actually the word is not new, but the way the word is applied as taken on new meaning. \\"Talent\\" now describes the people who work for an organization, with a particular focus on the skills, knowledge, and capabilities they bring. Talent is more than just workers; it's the collective capacity of people to contribute to the achievement of results. The concept of talent, as the definition is evolving, links the application of competence to fulfillment of corporate strategy. While some may argue that the difference between \\"workers\\" and \\"talent\\" is merely semantic, others will assert that the engagement of human capability-from education, experience, expertise, and leadership-adds considerable value to viewing employees as mere human resources. <br />This concept of \\"talent\\" and its appropriate productive use is getting a lot of attention in various books and periodicals. Jim Collins in his book, \\"Good to Great,\\" talks about having the right people---in the right seats---on the bus. Why? Having the most talented people to perform particular jobs is critical to an organization's success. <br />Most organizations don't have the right mix of people--talent---assigned to the right roles. And, to exacerbate the problem, they're burdened with too many people who, for various reasons, should no longer be employed by the company. The unavoidable consequence is that the organization is seriously inhibited in its drive to achieve its strategic objectives. <br />This potential-limiting condition can be overcome through effective talent management. This practice must be deeply imbedded in the corporate value system, touted by its leaders and enforced by its managers. Note that talent management is not a human resources issue; it's a leadership and management role. Human resource professionals have a part to play, but its not their game.<br />Sears begins his book with a vital section on the relationship between talent strategies and business strategies. They are inextricably linked; success at one strategy is interdependent with success in the other. It is obvious that attracting and engaging the right talent at the right time is essential. <br />In my work as a strategic business futurist concentrating on workforce and workplace trends, I have forecasted that the management of this linkage will influence the very survival of organizations. In our book, \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People,\\" we sounded a wake-up call for corporate leaders about the severe shortage of skilled labor coming in this decade. A major part of the solution---to avoid extinction---is talent management, and Sears teaches the process in his book. There is a clear and powerful congruence between anticipated challenges and recommended solutions. <br />Sears addresses how to build, deliver, and measure talent strategies in the second section of \\"Successful Talent Strategies.\\" From his perspective as a consultant with significant experience in the human resource field, explains, with ample examples, just how talent management works. Charts and graphs illustrate the journey, with the message continually connected to corporate strategy. The message is that talent strategy is driven by corporate strategy. The acquisition and application of talent, inside and outside the organization, enables leaders to achieve desired results. <br />This insightful how-to book will take some concentration to read and \\"get.\\" Not every leader nor experienced human resource professional will be able to fully immerse and gain the considerable value of this book. But that's what separates people who make things happen from those who wonder what happened. The convergence of trends will move us along at an increasingly rapid pace. If you want to be one of those who makes things happen, by understanding, developing, and applying cohesive strategies, read this book.	2002-11-09

That's the message to corporate leaders who have decades of reinforcement that their job is to control the people who work for them. There's a new game in town-a new way of operating that releases creativity, boosts productivity, and drives more profit to the bottom line. <br />This new approach involves stripping away the old ways of thinking about managing. It means removing policies that inhibit employees in their self-driven initiatives to do truly amazing things. The new approach suggests that people can work from anywhere without the traditional trappings to achieve results far beyond current reality. In a phrase, the new approach allows people to work naked, without constraints. Froggatt, a consultant specializing in aligning workplace strategies with business plans, describes the process as \\"shedding the layers\\" of control, overwork, conformity, hierarchy, poor communication, geography, and unproductive work environments to release the bonds.<br />While explaining the problems, Froggatt presents the principles that can empower a leadership team to change the way their company does business. Eight simple principles: initiative, trust, joy, individuality, equality, dialogue, connectivity, and workplace options. Some leaders will read this book and stick it on a shelf to gather dust. Others will really \\"get\\" the message and will transform their organizations. With the content of this book, and the way it is presented, transformation will not be that difficult . . . for the enlightened leaders. Unfortunately, we have far too few leaders who fit into that category. Hopefully this book will win a few more converts. <br />Do not expect policies, contracts, procedures, systems, and all that sort of garbage in these pages. No, this book is about people and principles. The pages are rich with concrete examples that will be an inspiration to readers who are inclined to adhere to the concept of working naked. Checklists, bullet-point lists, charts, diagrams, andplenty of chapter subheads make this book superbly readable. Adding to the value of \\"Work Naked\\" is an astonishingly detailed 13-page index and a index-like list of the companies profiled in the book. Over ten pages of chapter notes await you at the end of the book and a concise summary awaits you at the end of each chapter. <br />I read this book with a high degree of interest, from my perspective as co-author of \\"Impending Crisis: Too Many Jobs, Too Few People.\\" Our book talks about the coming severe labor shortage and how many companies are headed for extinction. \\"Work Naked\\" supplies the treasure map for employers who want to avoid extinction and thrive instead. <BR>Highly recommended!	2002-11-03

The power is in understanding the forces around you that can inhibit progress or send you careening off in the wrong direction. With that understanding, and the ability to act in a timely manner, you can achieve considerably greater success in the corporate world. <br />The first ten chapters of this insightful book address the factors that can stall progress. This portion will be quite educational for executives who haven't realized how many things could get in their way-many without even appearing to be blockages. Consider these stalls: lack of direction, wishful thinking, helplessness, defensiveness, independence, overoptimism, cover-up, and underestimation. Getting a little uncomfortable? Welcome to the club. These inhibitions are more common than you might think. However, knowledge is power; so understanding what's happening to you will give you the capacity to break through. <br />The stalls, thinking habits that get in our way, can be overcome. And the authors show readers how to get past the stalls with solutions and challenging questions. A liberal supply of anecdotes from the authors' consulting experiences illustrate the messages to help readers \\"get\\" what's happening and what they must do. With a deeper understanding of the company's conditions, you'll be motivated to really dig in and make some things happen.<br />The next eight chapters of the book will give you the tools you need, enhanced by lots of examples to help you understand the applications. The authors describe how measurement, environmental awareness, studying of best practices, and working differently with your people can make a substantial difference in your success. The epilogue chapter emphasizes why it's important to begin this work now, and not procrastinate. The velocity of change in the world has increased significantly, with more competition and other companies whose executives have read books like these and are striving to apply the principles.<br />A valuable touch from the authors is an appendix that applies their concepts to personal and family life. This section is a gift. Another appendix focuses on the internet and the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this vehicle. <br />The book is enhanced by summary introductions to each chapter (like executive summaries), a bibliography, and index. It's a work that will engage your thinking and stimulate some interesting-and productive-discussions among your leadership team.	2002-10-26

There are two strong motivations for this attitude. First, we parents want our kids to be better than we were . . . or at least give them more opportunities. Second, we know, as adults, how fast the world is moving now. If our kids put things off, the opportunities may pass them by. If you're a dedicated parent today, you may well be facing the challenge of a child who procrastinates just a bit more than you'd like to see.<br />Who better to write this book than the author of \\"The Procrastinator's Handbook,\\" a book that has made quite an impact over the past two years? Emmett digs right into the subject in a highly readable style Allow me to quote from the introduction, where the author best describes what you'll see. \\"The teen who puts off sending in his college application might procrastinate because it has become a habit (chapter 1). Or he may not have learned any self-motivating skills (chapter 2); he may feel overwhelmed by all the papers to fill out (chapter 3); he may hate this type of task (chapter 4); or he may feel he doesn't have time (chapter 5). He may be waiting for a whole day free of interruptions so he can do it perfectly (chapter 6), or have some fears and anxieties about going away to college (chapter 7). He might not know where all the forms are because they're scattered all over his desk, bedroom, and locker (chapter 8), and he may be so swamped with other activities that he can't focus on this task (chapter 9).\\" Chapter 10 is Hope for the Future. <br />The author emphasizes some points we must consider as we begin to read-and use-this book. Children hate having ideas forced on them. No single theory or technique works for every child. Children don't always think and act the same way you do. [You should have seen the way my teen-ager rolled her eyes when I showed her the book I was reading!]<br />Your head will bob up and down as you read through these pages. Yes! Yes!But, what to do? Not a problem. The book is full of advice and counsel, including \\"Ideas to Discuss\\" and \\"Ideas in Action\\" at the end of each chapter. They're presented as a teamwork process; this is something you do WITH your child, not TO your child. The Tips call-outs enhance the value of this volume.<br />This book is small (5.5 by 8 inches), but powerful. You can make a difference with the knowledge you gain in these pages-for your child and for yourself.	2002-10-26

The magazines and newspapers are filled with stories about the difficulties women wrestle with every day. Women without husbands and/or children face the same issues. The message is clear: gotta be in control!<br />Control. Organize. Direct. Internalize. Chaos. Responsibility. Stress. Ineffectiveness. Unhappiness. This flow is not going to good places. And that's what has to change. Mary LoVerde takes her readers through the process in a comfortable, conversational \\"been there\\" style that will be much-appreciated. <br />The text is filled with comments, testimonials, emotional expressions and more from a wide range of women. I was amazed at how much was woven into this book to make it a really helpful tool for all those women who have tried to improve their life by tightening their grip. Change comes when you understand that control is often confused with power. <br />LoVerde suggests that true power comes from six approaches: pose good questions, pay attention, predict your Achilles' Heel, partner with women, pause before judging, and position yourself. The book is filled with compassion. Women who follow the advice will find a new serenity. <br />Side comment: a lot of men could learn a lot from this book, too. Couples reading it together risk finding a new level of happiness.	2002-10-26

This book is a delightfully interesting combination of academic and general audience writing that makes it quite readable and holds your attention page after page. The content is nicely woven into twelve chapters that explain more aspects of attention, gaining attention, and holding attention than you could imagine. You'll learn a lot from these pages. An abundance of footnotes will give you more resources to pursue to expand your learning even further. <br />I turned down more pages than usual in this volume. I marked all sorts of things to share with others and to go back to. I even wrote notes on some of the pages, which I don't usually do when reading a book like this. The authors explain that \\"attention is the real currency of business and individuals...In post-industrial societies, attention has become a more valuable currency than the kind you store in bank accounts.\\" <br />The official definition: \\"Attention is focused mental engagement on a particular item of information. Items come into our awareness, we attend to a particular item, and then we decide whether to act.\\" There's more, but I don't want to spoil this delicious read for you. You'll gain valuable insight into the role of attention in all aspects of our lives, how the ability to manage our attention is all-powerful . . . and how we struggle with our own personal challenge of managing the tremendous volume of information and other stimulants that bombard our senses. Part of the attention process is filtering and sorting, which is difficult for some people and can be overwhelming. There is so much in this book that I have no hesitation in giving it very high marks. Have your highlighter ready!<br />The one negative-if it even is a negative-is the quotes and illustrative comments that appear in smaller type at the bottom of many of the pages. They distracted my attention from the flow of the text, making the book consciously a bit more difficult to read. Ah! The authors have made their point! Recommended for people in all walks of life; this is a book about us, not just an economy or business treatise.	2002-10-17

They're alternatively bullies, imposters, philosophers, tourists, Robin Hood, and observers of the passing scene. While some of the stories are feasible, others tax the reader's believability index. Some of the anecdotes challenge the imagination, causing the reader to suspect that some-if not all-of this book was created as a non-fiction work. <br />Fiction or non-fiction, you'll read something that seems like a  running commentary of conversations of a couple of college students high on something. You'll keep turning pages, wondering. The author shares some morals, some personal positions, and some enjoyable cynicism that makes this an unusual book.<br />The table of contents lists 43 chapters including a listing of topics covered in the chapters. The chapters themselves have no subheads, just straight text broken up by occasional caricature-like illustrations. From a production perspective, the book lacks some design elements usually seen in professionally done books, but it's simple and basic.<br />You'll shake your head, nod your head, and scratch your head. If this be reality, than what is fantasy? And if this be fantasy, where is the reality of life? Oh, the title? Comes from a poem written by Dave, in the latter part of the book.	2002-10-12

As a brand new member of the National Speakers Association, I was attending my first meeting of the organization. I'd been speaking professionally for four years, so I'd built a certain level of confidence, but walking into that meeting room humbled me. I wasn't sure what to expect, and felt little comfort in knowing that the other attendees shared my kind of work. Was I good enough? Would I be accepted.<br />To bolster my social posture, I moved toward the refreshment table. Maybe I'd be more comfortable meeting other people if I had a familiar cup of coffee in my hands. Perhaps I'd look more poised . . . or something.<br />A tall lanky fellow was standing by the table, pouring a cup of coffee. Pale yellow sweater. Gray, thinking hair. He turned toward me as I approached, handed me the coffee with his left hand and stuck out his right hand for a handshake. \\"Hi, I'm Og Mandino.\\"<br />I was blown away! His name was as familiar to me as the best known politicians, though much more revered. A best-selling author, his name and reputation commanded immediate respect and honor. What an experience to be welcomed by Og Mandino himself as the first person I met in the association. We relived that experience many times over the years as we gathered together with our colleagues in the speaking business.<br />Confession: I'd never read Og Mandino's books. Just didn't get around to it, though I'd heard they were good. There were always other things to read, other things to do. I did cherish my friendship with this gentle man and miss him now that he has passed away.<br />Finally, I got a copy of a volume that contains three of his powerful books: \\"The Greatest Salesman in the World,\\" \\"The Greatest Secret in the World,\\" and \\"The Greatest Miracle in the World.\\" I wasn't sure what I'd be reading, but I decided to plow through the pages so that I'd have had the experience of actually reading his words.  I was riveted. Captivated. Amazed. Moved. <br />The stories Og wove and the way he used words to express himself mesmerizing. The stories are beautiful and inspiring. He reached deep inside me somehow and rekindled some of my thoughts and motivations that have been dormant. It's hard to explain. This book will cause you to think, no . . . ponder. And it will change the way you look at yourself and your fellow Man. <br />I love to read books and write thoughtful reviews to help others decide if they want to read particular titles. One one hand, I feel that perhaps I should apologize for giving you more of a personal testimonial than a traditional book review. On the other hand, this sharing is probably the best expression to encourage you to spend some time with Og.<br />This review refers to the 2001 hardcover printing.	2002-10-04

Increasing demands challenge us with continual complications, too many choices, speed of change and action, and the sense of being caught in a whirlwind that defies the concept of life-work balance. We're expected to have all the answers, preferably before anyone else thinks about asking the questions. <br />Combine this gerbil-in-a-cage metaphor with the uncomfortable fact that most leaders haven't learned enough about leadership, and you have a dangerous combination. What is leadership? How is it different from being a manager? How can leaders keep their finger on the pulse of what's happening, inspire others to high achievement, guide their team members through difficult decisions, and still have time to actually finish a cup of coffee while it's still warm?<br />The solution is disarmingly simple: Ask questions. Listen to the answers. Ask some more questions. Give good answers to questions asked by others. <br />Easier said than done. There's an art to effective move-us-forward questions and answers. The secrets are in Chris Clarke-Epstein's book. She provides us with 78 valuable questions, but doesn't stop there. In addition to gaining a fine list of questions , we benefit from an explanation of the importance of the question, how to ask it well, and what might be accomplished through the questioning technique. The style is friendly, conversational, and supportive, seasoned with short stories or vignettes that illustrate the many helpful suggestions and observations offered by the author.<br />The book's chapters are organized to categorize the questions and the commentary surrounding them. The first category, presented after a few pages of positioning, addresses questions leaders need to ask themselves. Chapter 2 presents questions leaders need to ask customers. The third and fourth chapters explore questions tobe asked of employees-lots of creative stuff here. <br />In Chapter 5, we ponder questions to be asked in special situations: new employees, coaching and mentoring, newly promoted leaders, and crisis. Questions leaders need to answer are followed by answers for special situations. What a handbook! You can read this book straight through as I did, or use it for reference (as I will). The last chapter talks about delivering tough answers, sometimes a difficult proposition for leaders. More questions are suggested in the appendix and a website has been established to continue the question-building process. An index facilitates reference. The Suggested Reading list is a bonus.<br />The book is peppered with quotes about questions and answers that reinforce the points and/or give the reader something more to think about. At the end of each chapter are questions and worksheets for the reader, encouraging some deeper thinking and reflection. Overall, a worthwhile book for leaders-and aspiring leaders-to read, absorb, and keep handy.	2002-10-01

The distractions of not-fully-developed technology were being overcome and the media was increasing in use-for ongoing meetings as well as formal conference presentations. Some people are fairly proficient with the use of videoconferencing-understanding when, where, how, and why. Most of us are relatively ignorant, a dangerous position when videoconferencing on an individual and group level is exploding. <br />Finally there's a book that guides us through the many important aspects of this emerging field. Lead author Janelle Barlow is an accomplished speaker with an international reputation. The co-authors work for the same consulting firm. They have extensive experience participating in videoconferences, so they've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. Realizing that there was not a good comprehensive layman's book in the field, they did the research and prepared a tool to educate and prepare us. Their perspective is that videoconferencing is growing, but will not replace face-to-face meetings. The new technology has its place, and reading this book will help you understand where that \\"place\\" is in the grand scheme of human-to-human communication.<br />The authors propose that there are four habits to learn and embrace to look good and have a high level of effectiveness. The habits, which are each explained-taught-in separate chapters, are Leverage Your Choices (videoconferencing is not always appropriate), Think Prime Time (viewers expect you to look good-and professional . . . just like what they see on commercial television), Make Technology Your Friend (it all works for you, if you let it . . . but then, there's Murphy's Law), and Maximize Your Presence (the little tricks of the trade to improve your appearance and presentation). <br />Rather than throw readers directly into the deep end of the pool, the authors invest the firsts section of their book in a valuable explanation of videoconferencing's position, opportunities, and limitations. After they've presented their habits, they conclude with a comprehensive checklist, legal issues like copyrights, and a perspective on the future of the field. More added value comes from the appendices on storyboarding and commonly mispronounced words. Included are a bibliography, index, and a comprehensive list of terms used in the field. Vignettes about experiences with videoconferencing spice up each chapter, providing a lightness and a sort of permission to be human. <br />This is a developing medium, not a science. Learn from this book, try videoconferencing, allow yourself to make some mistakes, and build your competence and confidence. The future is here.	2002-09-29

The internet is a very active place, but still full of exciting opportunities. Feeling entrepreneurial or adventurous? You can create your own market on the net. The authors suggest that the future of exchange of products, services, and payment will accelerate in cyberspace. While the opportunities abound, there is a lot to learn . . . and there are risks. But, that's why you read a book like \\"Making Markets.\\"<br />First, some perspective. The authors emphasize that \\"electronic markets are not technological interactions. They are human interactions supported by technology.\\" Ignore this principle and failure awaits you in the way it doomed the electronic markets in the 1990s. \\"Cyberspace markets cannot be thin replicas of the traditional market. Rather they must be as rich, complex, and compete as the traditional markets themselves.\\" The basic trade processes of search, pricing, logistics, payment and settlement, and authentication must still be in place. Value must be created for all participants, and the electronic marketing venture must fit with the firm's other marketing vehicles. Creativity will have a significant influence on success. <br />The authors begin with an explanation of the opportunities, the value of marketing in cyberspace. The first chapter includes an explanation of the design of their presentation in the remaining seven chapters. Chapter titles give us an insight into the content: From Place to Space, Making Markets Work, and Auctions: The Devil is in the Details. Readers will learn about Using B2B markets in the Supply Chain, Using Markets Creatively, and Market Tactics. Dynamic Market Strategies are address in the final chapter, followed by a call to action encouraging you to stick your toes in the water and try this approach.<br />Each chapter is filled with education, insight, and mini-case studies to show us what has worked and what hasn't worked. You'll learn the jargonand the steps in the process. A good notes section, including website addresses, is complemented by a helpful index. And, expectedly, the authors offer a website for the book where more information and support is available. If you're ready to open your mind to some fascinating possibilities, curl up with \\"Making Markets.\\"	2002-09-28

I never cease to be amazed at how many call centers-inbound and outbound-operate in the United States, and in other countries as well. Thousands and thousands of people reaching out for more business and servicing existing customers through call centers. <br />But, all is not happy in call center land. These facilities are often plagued by high-and very costly-employee turnover and a wide range of inefficiencies. Many of the people running these operations are relatively untrained people who have been promoted from within, because there are too few true professionals in the field. Think about it: how many people do you know who have majored in Call Center Management? You'd think there'd be masters-level programs in the field with the tremendous opportunities that abound. Sorry. You'll have to learn the ropes some other way.<br />There are really two choices to learning everything you might need to be a real pro in this field. One is to understudy someone who really knew the field and could coach and mentor you to success. Those wise people are few, far between, very well paid, and probably too busy to spend much time with you. The other alternative is this book.<br />Imagine a 486-page book that would teach you every aspect of call center operations. Imagine that this book would explain each facet of the business so you could really \\"get it\\"-well enough to write your own ticket in the field. \\"Call Center Operations\\" is about as close as you'll ever get to the dream book in this specialty. Fifteen chapters, six appendices, and a comprehensive eight-page index... <br />Given the volume of information between these covers, a listing of the chapters will help you gain a better appreciation of the power in these pages: Introduction to Call Center Operations; Management, Business, and Marketing; Telecommunications and Network Facilities and Premise-Based Telephone Systems (these two chapters hit the technological side of the business). You'll learn from chapters on Telecom Industry Perspective, Automatic and Predictive Dialing, Client-Server Technology, Graphical User Interface and Legacy Hosts, and Relational Database Management Systems. Yes, we're getting deep now, but the more you know the stronger manager you will be. Chapter 10 addresses Call Center Software Packages and Systems and 11 gets into Computer-Telephone Integration. Continue with Workload Management, Forecasting, and Staff Schedule Modeling and then ask How Does Your Call Center Measure Up. The last two chapters look at Service Bureaus and Reference Materials. <br />If this book is beginning to feel like a college textbook, you understand. This is not a book for the weak or the meek. This is a treasure for the pros who have been searching for an \\"everything you ever wanted to know\\" book. Working my way through it to write this review, I learned more than I'll ever need to know about this growing field, and I gained a deep appreciation for those responsible for running call center operations professionally.	2002-09-24

Jeff Thredgold is an economic futurist, a well-grounded forecaster. Today he works as an economic consultant and professional speaker, but his career includes 23 years with $85 billion banking giant KeyCorp, where he served as Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. He's frequently interviewed on CNN, CNBC, and the financial press. He has a reputation for explaining economic trends in terms that everyone can understand and appreciate. He takes \\"the dismal science\\" and makes it interesting and enjoyable.<br />This book is a sort of Everyman's Guide to Economic Issues. Everything You Ever Wanted to Know, but Didn't Know What to Ask. Information, insights, and observations are presented in eight categories: The US Economy; the US Government; Money, Inflation, and Interest Rates; Investment and Savings; Global Issues; Global Players; The American Consumer; and The Changing Workplace. Each chapter is filled with background information and lots of short-takes about various aspects of our economic life. Boxes contain more information and, along with some graphs and charts, break the flow of the text. The result is greater readability, combined with a tight focus USA Today-style presentation of what could be complicated material.<br />Even though this book was published in 2000, the knowledge Thredgold delivers is still relevant and educational. His appendix on \\"Happy Talk\\" reminds us of many of the positive aspects of the economy, while many dwell on how terrible things are. You'll be amazed at the depth and breadth of material covered in just 164 pages-which include some good-natured humor and several pages of helpful definitions. The index is complemented with a list of charts and tables. <br />If you're looking for a book that will help you understand this all-important field, I'd recommend \\"Economy by Thredgold.\\" He doesn't cover the Middle East, the Pacific Rim, or Africa in depth, but gives the reader enough insight to better understand how actions in those arenas affect us all.	2002-09-22

Some work beautifully to produce wonderful successes; others are miserable failures. Why? The authors conducted research with over 6,000 team members and discovered five factors that determine a team's success: collaboration, relationships, group processes, leadership, and the organizational environment. This book is a report of what they learned, loaded with plenty of advice for increasing team effectiveness. <br />After an introductory prologue, the book delivers five well-organized chapters that correspond to the factors of success. The first chapter explores what makes a good team member--abilities and behaviors that matter. What determines how collaborative someone will be in a team setting? The second chapter examines relationships among members of teams: what's most important, where are the greatest challenges, and how can you make it all work?<br />In the third chapter, the authors look into team problem solving. Included are the distinguishing factors of good problem-solving teams, dynamics and processes of solving problems and making decisions, and building systems that support results. Chapter four really digs into the team leader, reviewing six key dimensions of the role. This chapter alone is worth buying this book. Following the research-based model, the last chapter zeros in on the organizational environment. The authors evaluate management practices, structure and processes, and systems in an insightful look at how the environment affects team performance. <br />Each chapter is preceded by a one-page Snapshot that offers a valuable overview of the chapter. Two indexes and a half-dozen pages of notes add more value to this volume. Good flow, readable, and useful. Recommended as a good tool for team leaders, members, and encouragers in any organization.	2002-09-16

Guerrillas are defined as &quot;business operators who substitute time, energy, and imagination for money . . . small businesses who have big dreams rather than big bankrolls.&quot;<br />Although his name as shown as the primary author, I don't think Levinson had much to do with writing this book. And that's OK. It's OK because the other co-authors are well-known and respected publicists who have achieved results for their clients for many years. They know what they're talking about. Personally, I don't think they had to hitch their wagon to Levinson's star; but the name and theme do add something to the book.<br />Frishman and Lublin have written a book that addresses fundamentals. You'll read things like &quot;Publicity never sleeps. It's an ongoing, 24/7 process that never stops. Since you're the product, you're also your own best marketing tool.&quot; Beginners who use this book (note my word &quot;use,&quot; not just &quot;read&quot;) will find a wealth of advice and technique in these pages. People who have built some experience over the years, promoting themselves or their product or service, will find refreshing reminders and some things they haven't thought about before. This &quot;new stuff&quot; aspect applies particularly to some of the ideas about using e-mail and the internet. There's even more that Frishman and Lublin didn't cover in this area, but once you get started, you'll find those new approaches. Their writing will stimulate your creative juices to develop more strategies. Their resource guide at the end of the book will give you more places to go for learning.<br />Most of the book consists of over 30 short chapters, each addressing a particular aspect of publicity. Ideas and concepts are presented, developed, then summarized in a &quot;Remember&quot; paragraph at the end of the chapter. This pattern makes the book easy to follow and use as a tool to enhance your ongoing publicity campaign. The index will help you go back to find particular topics, so this book will remain on your shelf as a long-time reference tool. The easy-to-read title on the spine will make it easy to spot and retrieve. <br />Appendix A provides almost fifty pages of sample promotional materials for books. Understandably, Adams Media, the publisher, is dominant. In this section, the authors could have included samples of promotional materials for other products and/or recognized materials from other publishers or publicists. The book also includes the obligatory worksheet, quotations at the beginning of each chapter, and a few proofreading errors. <br />This is a book that you can read cover-to-cover, marking pages and highlighting. Take notes as you develop your publicity plan. It's a great tool for catapulting yourself to fame and fortune-if your product is worthy and you follow the publicity principles presented here.	2002-09-15
US	52870090	R290D29MFW7TEF	0060081988	499540845	The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR	Books	4	10	14	N	N	Interesting, Entertaining, Repetitive	The fundamental principle is public relations first, advertising second. The message is strong--over and over and over again, starting with the title. The authors, respected marketing consultants (previously-published gurus?), relate that marketers have placed advertising on a pedestal. Advertising is King. Long Live Advertising!<br />Wrong, they say. Advertising has historically and consistently been a waste of money. They cite case after case (it gets tiring after a while) of major advertising campaigns, many very well known, that were highly successful in winning awards and high profits for advertising agencies . . . but did not accomplish the results for the clients. I suspect there are great case studies of ad campaigns that increased sales substantially, but the authors don't share those examples. Instead they relate story after story of advertising's failure to deliver sales, preaching in page after page that sales actually suffered-especially in relation to competitors' sales--as a result of advertising. The reader gets the distinct sense that most advertising is a total waste of money and a manifestation of poor management. If this message takes hold in corporate America, advertising media such as magazines, newspapers, billboards, and broadcast will be in serious trouble.<br />The first section of the book is an extensive, perhaps overdone, sermon against the evils and misfortunes of advertising. The second section explores how public relations--publicity--has been substantially more effective and considerably less expensive for organizations seeking to communicate their message and attract customers. In section three, Ries and Ries suggest that advertising does have it's place, behind PR, to maintain the brand established through PR. <br />The authors complete the book with a series of short comparisons about what Advertising is, compared to what Public Relations is. Examples: Advertising is the Wind; PR is the Sun. Advertising is Spatial; PR is Linear; Advertising Reaches Everybody, PR Reaches Somebody; and Advertising is Brand Maintenance, PR is Brand Building. Postscript chapters for management, advertising, and PR complete the book, which is supported by a helpful index.<br />It's an interesting book that probably could have been a bit shorter, given that the early section began to get repetitive . . . almost boring. The authors offer a wide range of good points; the book is instructive. Some will argue with the premise of the book, but it makes sense when you consider that various aspects of the presentation. Is there a counterpoint? Are there examples of successful advertising campaigns? Is this situation black & white, or are their significant shades of grey?	2002-09-07

And it's all focused on helping you make the sale; the title of Part VII is You Must Close the Sale in Order to Go to the Bank. The message can't be any more clear!<br />Let's start at the beginning. There are three sections at the start of the book that caught my attention right away. You know there's something special going on when you see sections titled &quot;Why You Need This Book,&quot; &quot;Why You Will Love This Book,&quot; and &quot;Why an Intelligent, Sophisticated Person Like You Will Appreciate a Simple Book Like This.&quot; Simple book? In the fundamental principles that are presented, yes. In the depth and strength of the material, I wouldn't call this book simple. Sales professionals will spend extra time with each section to draw out all the value for themselves. It's just that kind of a book . . . the kind of tool that can be used for reference as well as straight-on learning.<br />Stewart starts his substance with Position Yourself for Success presented in six chapters. The last chapter of the section is focused on closing. Part II: Develop Rapport and Build Relationships of Trust and Confidence: four chapters ending with emphasis on closing more sales. Continue through sections on  pre-call planning, prospect involvement, discovery, presentations, and handling objections. Want more?

There is a vital need today for strong, deliberate leadership in organizations today. We can learn lessons from history, such as what this book offers from the leadership of Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen of England. <br />This book is a leadership book, with illustrations from the 45-year reign of Elizabeth I over 400 years ago. Queen Elizabeth inherited a realm-a corporation-that was in horrible shape. Turnaround time. The leadership she applied carefully and deliberately moved the country from a dysfunctional feudal condition to be one of the most powerful and influential countries in the world. <br />After an introduction to conditions at the time, Axelrod presents 136 leadership principles, each illustrated with strategies and behaviors from Elizabeth's experience. An interesting historical treatise is interwoven with leadership lessons. The author, in illustrating his principles, uses examples from the Elizabethan period, but not in chronological order. This approach makes the book a bit difficult to follow historically, but that's not the purpose of the book. An appendix provides a timeline of the period for those interested in that aspect of the topic. An index enhances the value of the work, as well. <br />Each of the lessons stands alone, creating occasional redundancy and repetition. It's noticeable in places, but not really a bother when you appreciate how each lesson is independent, yet integrated with the others. Executives will benefit from reading these pages and contemplating how they express the principles in their work, in their lives. Good for group discussion in ongoing staff meetings, as well.	2002-08-31

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Inspiring, Instructive	As we rise in levels of responsibility in organizational life, we begin to hear the tern, &quot;servant leadership.&quot; Essentially, it's giving of yourself to support others, rather than leading by dominating others. A number of books have been written on the topic, but this one is different. The title is deceiving; your first thought might be that it's a parody or pick-up on Harvey MacKay's &quot;Never Give a Naked Man Your Shirt.&quot; <br />This book is about knowing yourself so you better understand others to serve them and the world. It's about getting off the merry-go-round of life and making a positive difference in the lives of those around us. Berardi has given us a book that is thought-provoking . . . and heart-provoking. <br />I found myself turning down so many page corners that I finally gave up. There are nuggets on practically every  page. &quot;All things are possible for those who find their own unique way of serving others.&quot; &quot;You don't have to be perfect to live a purposeful life as a servant leader.&quot; &quot;We have blocked so much from our lives, we find that we're not really living at all.&quot; &quot;People don't necessarily know what it is they actually need because they're focused more on what they want.&quot;<br />The first of the four sections of the book explains servant leadership. Then readers gain a wonderful experience in part two, learning how to get themselves ready to truly serve others. Part III is The Practical Side of Identifying and Serving the Needs of Others. The last section of the book describes Miracles in the Making. A reading list and index enhance the value of this volume. <br />Never Offer Your Comb to a Bald Man is illuminated by stories from the author's life, from the experiences of perspectives of people he has known, and from stories of others who bring life to each of the author's points. Although, this book is hard to put down for enjoyable and thoughtful reading, it can also serve as a text for what a lot of business leaders need to learn. I imagine a number of people who have read this book have slowed down, reoriented their thinking, and gained a whole new perspective and level of productivity in their lives.	2002-08-31

This is not a business book. I'm not sure how I got it, but somehow this unusual (for me) book appeared on my shelf of books to review. I took it along on a business trip, more out of curiosity and whimsy than a particular interest in actually reading the book. On the airplane, for some reason, I decided to skim through \\"Pay Attention, for Goodness Sake\\" instead of reading a business book I'd also brought along. <br />This read was refreshing. Good word. It was a refreshing change of pace from my usual fare. But, it was also re-freshing, if I may hyphenate for emphasis. Sylvia Boorstein, both a Jew and a Bhuddist, has written a number of books. Thought I haven't read them, I suspect, like this one, they teach in a conversational, comfortable way. I learned and found some interesting comfort as I read through these pages, like having an interesting discussion with someone who knows more than you do. You want to listen. As I turned page to page, I found myself held to the book. I wanted to read a little more and a little more. <br />This is a thoughtful book, describing ten \\"paramitas\\" or perfections. The organization and flow of the book makes it easy to grasp the author's message and organize it in your own mind. The introduction explains the concepts and their application. Each \\"perfection\\" or practices is presented in its own chapter: Generosity, Morality, Renunciation, Wisdom, Energy, Patience, Truthfulness, Determination, Lovingkindness, and Equanimity. I would describe the work as an instructional guide that inspires the reader to think . . . no, to ponder. <br />This is not a business book in the customary classification of books, but I'd certainly recommend it for current and aspiring business leaders. We all need to pay attention more than we are; we miss so much in today's rush-rush world. Take time to reflect, to ponder. Refresh yourself with thisbook.	2002-08-27

Located at the southern tip of South America, it spans portions of both Chile and Argentina. A many-faceted environment, it is closer to Antarctica . . . complete with penguins, glaciers, and much, much more.<br />Author Dick Lutz, a veteran of three previous nature/travel books, takes us on a delightful journey of this little-known region. The first chapter is a sort of journal of his experience on a guided tour, reporting one adventure after another. Throughout the chapter are references to later chapters for detail on what Lutz has seen and experienced on the tour.<BR>Just reading the first chapter alone will be a worthwhile education, but there's so much more to this book.<br />The following four chapters deliver a considerable amount of information to the reader. You could never even ask all the questions that are answered in these pages. Chapters on the environment, history, native groups, and Patagonia today are chock-full of information that makes for fascinating reading. The environment chapter explores a wide range of facts, including the wildlife, terrain, and climate. The now-extinct Patagonian Indians are described in Chapter 4, while Chapter 5 explains the current situation in this sparsely populated region governed by two nations. <br />A long appendix of Darwin's 1834 treatise of his experience in the area, as written in \\"Voyage of the Beagle,\\" is simply inserted into the book. There is no explanation or connection with the rest of the book. However, a bibliography, seven color photos, and index add extra value to this intriguing book. <br />If you're interested in visiting the region (I am now) or just want to learn about it, this book will be an enjoyable eye-opener. Well-researched, well-written.	2002-08-26

Major consulting firms have established whole departments around the concept, much has been written, and there's even a magazine called \\"Human Capital.\\" <br />We used to talk about \\"personnel,\\" then the term shifted to \\"human resources.\\" The same thing, but different words? No. The human resources concept is more broad, more comprehensive, and hopefully more strategic. So what's the difference with this newer term of \\"human capital?\\" This concept emphasizes measurement---measuring the value of people to their employing organization. The human capital value doesn't show up on the balance sheet, at least not yet, like other forms of capital. Investors, however, are paying more attention to concerns like staffing levels, worker competency, employee performance, and workforce stability.<br />Interestingly, while chief human resource officers typically have strong relationships with their chief executive officers, their least effective relationships are with chief financial officers. These results from a recent survey of senior HR executives was quite revealing, demonstrating that human capital valuation has not yet reached all those who should be concerned about it. This book will help. It's written for people who have responsibility for generating revenue, increasing profitability, or enhancing productivity. <br />The author, a nationally-known consultant and speaker in the field of strategic growth and leadership development, marries the two concepts well in these pages. She starts with The Strategic Importance of Human Capital with three chapters that do a fine job of positioning, education, and stimulating thought. Each chapter is recapped with a summary of key ideas and thinking points. Just flipping to the of each chapter and reading these pages will give you your money's worth from this volume. These chapters cover the broad spectrum of relevant trends and issue to givereaders insight into the \\"why\\" as well as the \\"what.\\"<br />Part Two, Measuring Human Capital, provides an in-depth survey of the measurements being used to value employees today, as well as the organizations that are engaged in this work. In spite of a brief section on moving from theory to practice on page 81, the author does not present any specific recommendations about which process should be used. <br />Part Three shifts to How to Develop Human Potential in the Firm. The more modern concepts are presented here: attracting talent, developing employees, virtual capital, building leadership, and looking at human capital as an investment in the organization. As an appendix, Aldisert offers her Valuing People AuditSM. It's a check-off list with a 5-point Likert scale exploring how much attention is given to issues that affect the people side of the business. Thus, the book explores well the concept of valuing human capital, but does not definitively provide a step-by-step specific method. There isn't a standard yet, but this book builds the understanding that could provide a platform for such development. First, corporate executives need to understand the concept of valuing their employees as human capital. This book will certainly help. <br />Good notes section and strong index.	2002-08-24

The lesson is about recruiting the best hourly employees, a message that is vital to today's employers. The setting is a grocery retailer, but could easily apply to any organization employing hourly workers.<br />The key to success today is recruiting, hiring, and retaining top talent. Competition for top talent will intensify as the economy heats up again, so now is the time to learn the lessons of this book . . . and apply them. Human resources professionals, small company owners, managers, and supervisors will all benefit from this quick read. <br />There are many lessons in this book including \\"A Marketing Approach to Recruiting, Jobseeker Profiles, Job Analysis, Attracting Applicants, Sources of Applicants, and Managing Turnover. Appendices on the authors' Magnetic Company philosophy and tactics add value to the book, as do the summaries at the end of each chapter. <br />Lots of helpful, practical knowledge packed into a story that's easy and enjoyable to read. The lessons almost sneak up on you as you read the interesting tale. Good balance between fiction and moral.	2002-08-23

And in today's world, with legal constraints and applicants driving interviews, the process is certainly different than in the past. This book offers some good practical tactical advice for interviewers, presenting the information in a way that's easy to grasp. This ease of understanding is vitally important for department heads and other people who now participate in sequential or shared interview experiences. If you don't interview applicants every day, you just don't know this information.<br />Fry has written other books on this topic---from the applicant's perspective. He's the author of the strong-selling &quot;101 Great Answers to the Toughest Interview Questions.&quot; It's interesting to watch him play both sides of the table like this whole hiring process is like a grand game of chess.<br />But, hiring people is not a game. It's serious business. To hire the right people, you have to ask the right questions. It's important to understand what the answers are telling you and how your questions and the applicant's answers guide your hiring decisions. <br />The Table of Contents is sparse. It really doesn't help the reader determine where to find things in the book. Fortunately, there is a somewhat helpful index that can assist, but that's going backward. The book begins with some preliminary information about job advertising and resume screening. Chapter 2 explores interview styles including telephone interviews, team interviews, behavioral interviews, and stress interviews. Next, the reader is instructed about what to look for in the interview, then comes the interview process itself. Various categories of questions are presented, with suggestions of good answers (represented by the green light graphic) and not-so-good answers (represented by the red light graphic). This pattern begins on page 72 and continues through the balance of the book. I felt a sense of too much of a pattern, like an assembly line process, in the presentation of the information, though there is value in the advice that is shared. <br />Chapter 11, Staying Out of the Legal Cauldron, may be one of the most valuable chapters of the book. It contains several pages of questions that interviewers are NOT allowed to ask by law. In those organizations (most?) that have supervisors and potential co-workers interview applicants, this information is vital to impart.	2002-08-18

The author is a proven expert in his field-a specialty that has enduring value for individuals, teams, and organizations. <br />The book--full of advice and counsel that would cost you thousands in a personal consultation--is organized into five strategies. The strategies are Direction, Culture, Empowerment, Coaching, and Renewal. Each strategy is presented as a section of the book, with three or four chapters on each category. Two special features add value to this book: an abundance of relevant quotes throughout the book and cameo contributions from thirteen fairly well-known authors and executives. A bibliography and index round out the book.<br />Under Direction, Allenbaugh shows readers how to link purpose and passion with performance. Chapters focus on creating a compelling mission and vision, linking into your passion, and implementing your vision. The Culture section describes how to sustain a results-oriented, customer-focused climate-valuable for individuals as well as organizations. The three chapters illuminate various aspects of culture, including the importance of values. The Empowerment section focuses on releasing human potential. There are several insightful chapters on empowering people, honoring the differences among people, and hiring winners by using Attitude, Aptitude, and Alignment as filters. The coaching section addresses building others' success, effective expression and listening skills, and a focus on results. The last portion of the book explores the &quot;3 Rs of Renewal: Release, Reaffirm, and Reinvent.&quot; Chapters on individual renewal and organizational renewal contribute useful perspectives. <br />Easy-to-read book for individuals, managers, business owners, consultants, and those charged with the responsibility (and opportunity) of coaching others to deliberate success. This is a good how-to book, enjoyable and enlightening as a read-through and worthwhile as a reference when you need a re-focus.	2002-08-17

What a resource to have for your international experience.<br />Some Americans who work in other countries do so by choice; others are assigned to overseas posts by their employers. This book works well for both situations, though it begins with lots of advice for people who are driving their own career choices.

The big question about how to find work abroad is fully explored to help you make educated decisions. Those first two chapters are Get Started---Focus and Get the Facts---Research.<br />Chapter 3 advises Get Connected---Network!

It's obvious that Anna Wildermuth wants to help you with your appearance and Linda Brakefall wants to help you with your empowerment, professionalism, and effectiveness. Their addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses are easy-too easy for this reviewer-to find in the book. OK, let's get past the commercial and the authors introducing themselves at the beginning of the book. Let's get into the meat.<br />The book is organized into 26 Keys for success. Each key is a chapter with text written by the authors and a wide range of guest columnists-cameo appearances, if you will, by people with expertise in the subject matter. These contributions, in a smaller type size, are a bit of a stopper as you read the book, but build a sort of sense of community. Hmmm. Stopper. Like a speed bump or a curve in the road.<br />Actually, the whole book is designed with curves and speed bumps that slow the reader's pace so more can be absorbed. The pages are filled with tips and quizzes and quotes and questions to answer. Quite a bit to absorb-like the authors mixed a stew and threw everything in that would add to the &quot;body.&quot; The &quot;body&quot; of this book is loaded. It's a potpourri of information and advice about being taken seriously, rising to the top, charm and charisma, personal and professional style, approachability, color, clothing, business travel, image, and working with your shape. You will find helpful information on business make-up, hair and grooming, business etiquette, interviewing for a job, presentation skills, and public speaking. <br />The authors cover a wide range of topics, though I'm not sure that I agree with all they suggest. Being a man, I asked a couple of businesswomen to look at this book with me so I could be sure to be fair. Their response included words like &quot;inconsistent,&quot; &quot;unprofessional,&quot; and &quot;very basic.&quot; <br />There's a section in the back of the book offering resources for additional learning. By category, you will find what I believe are book titles and authors. There is insufficient detail for those who might want to access additional information, but readers could use search engines on the world wide web to do their research.<br />The authors are, no doubt, fine professionals in their fields. Unfortunately, while it offers valuable content, this book is not as professional as it could be. Advertisements at the end of every chapter is a bit much. The publishing of this book was managed by The Jenkins Group, says a statement on the back cover. They should have been more deeply involved to keep this stew from becoming stone soup.	2002-08-11

If the right people learn about the product or service at the right time, in a way they can accept and believe, there is a good chance they will buy. And that's the principal objective. Marketing exists so sales can be made. That's why I got warm feeling when I discovered that this book has two chapters on selling. But marketing can be expensive and corporate executives want to understand what campaigns will cost and what kind of return on investment they can expect. There's a chapter on budgeting.<br />This is an impressive book. It covers a lot of material and organizes it well. Twenty-one chapters and an index. Don't believe the title, though. It's going to take you more than a day to get through this book. There's just so much there! Very complete. Note: This is the kind of book that serves as a great reference work as well as a cover-to-cover read.<br />The author begins with a chapter on some of the basics of marketing, then launches into the importance of knowing your market and understanding positioning and branding. Chapter 4 addresses creating marketing plans, which, amazingly, isn't covered sufficiently in the real college courses. Creative thinking is explored, then cleverly connected to strategic planning. Music to my ears-someone who actually understands that marketing creativity has to actually do something to produce strategic results, or it's useless. <br />Skill-focused chapters enable readers to learn about copywriting, design, and working with an advertising agency. The chapter on product launch even includes discussion on business life cycles. Public relations is covered in two chapters, including one specifically addressing the all-important media relations. A discussion on demographics is followed by a couple of chapters about on-line marketing. <br />The book design is helpful. Large enoughtype and enough white space to make it very readable. The language of the text also helps-interesting, flows well, appropriate stories. For executives, business owners, marketers needing new perspectives and reinforcement, and for students, this book is a treasure.	2002-08-11

His career includes 25 years as a practicing psychologist. Over a lifetime, Radde has studied human behavior, observing that most people simply survive, not thrive. They don't really relish life at its fullest. His practice-and this book-are a sort of a mission to help people really maximize their lives. <br />Radde's concern is that &quot;Very few people seem to be living in a thriving space, or letting on that they are, if indeed they are. One percent currently derive the richest experience of, and full enjoyment from, their lives.&quot; The balance are Committed Seekers (35%), Going About Their Daily Lives (40%), or Think Thriving is a Forbidden Fruit (24%). So, the focus of his book &quot;is on this exceptional state of well-being called thriving . . . an experience of lightness, expansiveness, and exceptional well-being: the precise exceptional moments of well-being that many people say make life worth living.&quot;<br />The book is organized into three parts: Defining Thriving and Thrival, Getting Started on Your Path to Thriving, and Rules &amp; Guidelines to Access Thriving. The twenty chapters range from Life Can Be Better to Entering the Thrival Era, Opening Yourself Up, Five Things You Can Control, and Meet Your Essential Need for Balance. The third section of the book includes three rules and seven guidelines for thriving and a guide to getting it all together. A recommended reading list expands the reader's opportunity to learn. <br />This book is a first-person sharing and caring that opens into a sort of conversation, a discussion about the topic. Readers will nod, contemplate, and perhaps make adjustments in their lives to reach closer to Radde's thrival state. For those who would like a sort of personal experience with an introspective psychologist and close observer of life, this book will be very enjoyable. For those who don't desire to really get in touch with their inner selves, this is not the time for you to read this book.	2002-08-10

Oh, there are plenty of people out there, most of whom want to work. However, if they don't have the skills that are in demand by employers, their work opportunities and career futures are limited. Employers will compete to attract and hold the people with the skills to get the job done. Savvy workers will compete to acquire and market skills that will be in demand and that will make them unique and marketable in the world of work. Many will do well. Other employers and workers will not fare so well, changing the face of employment.<br />This book addresses a wide range of topics, organized into three sections: Measuring Human Capital Development, Reports from the Firing Line: Improving Productivity and Performance, and Developing People. The content is not directed just toward educators or professionals in the field of training and development. It is more broad-based. As explained by the author in his introduction, &quot;For the business person, &quot;Skill Wars&quot; is a policy book about managing and measuring workplace performance and profit. For the union leader and employee, &quot;Skill Wars&quot; is about employability and personal growth. For parents, &quot;Skill Wars&quot; is about their children's future careers and guaranteed participation in &quot;the American Dream.&quot; For politicians and government leaders, &quot;Skill Wars&quot; is a blueprint for what new voters are beginning to demand in every state across America: new laws to create a more knowledgeable workforce. For educators and trainers, &quot;Skill Wars&quot; offers new ideas on how to better collaborate with all these groups and create innovative, diverse curricula, whether in a schoolroom or the corporate classroom.&quot;<br />Ninety figures illustrate the book, accompanying the text to illuminate the concepts delivered on page after page by Edward Gordon, PhD, a consultant specializing in human/intellectual capital for over two decades. His teaching experience at DePaul, Loyola, and Northwestern Universities complement his work as a consultant, writer, and speaker. Gordon certainly has the credibility and background to write this important book.<br />You will bob your head up and down in agreement as you read this book. You'll also shake your head in disbelief and amazement as you realize how far behind we are-how much remains to be done. Gordon cites the numbers, concentrating on the ROI: the Return on Investment in building skills and capacity. The research has been done on this book, as evidenced by the number of footnotes offering bibliographical references. The pages are packed with information. <br />The final chapter, Investing in Human Capital: A Blueprint for the 21st Century, is particularly powerful . . . and should be carefully considered by everyone in a position to help  build the skill base that will be needed. And that's all of us. Gordon warns that &quot;The gap between the so-called 'knowledge workers' and low skilled workers is widening at an alarming rate.&quot; Why is the gap  growing? &quot;Because too many businesses are engaged in an act of financial levitation, trying to make bigger and bigger stacks of money from companies that are barely growing. Their magic act centers on cost-cutting, squeezing staffs, slashing training, eliminating everything except their 'core business operations.' The predominant American management philosophy of the 1990s has been that business exists only to drive up stock prices and enrich shareholders.&quot; <br />As we've seen in recent months, this strategy has been damaging, to say the least. More sensitive employers are creating life-work balanced environments, demonstrating stewardship for the world around us, and taking other steps to correct and improve our corporate society. &quot;Skill Wars&quot; should stimulate more serious efforts to build workforce competencies or all the other efforts will be smoke-and-mirrors and façade. <br />More people need to read this book.

Without people, most organizations would be unable to meet their objectives, pay their bills, and satisfy their owners. Many corporations have difficulty getting properly organized and filling positions with the right people even in present-day terms. Looking into the future, even a few months into the future, is beyond the scope of most human resource departments. They're too busy scrambling to address current problems.<br />There are three components necessary for solid strategic staffing-the planning for the company's future workforce needs. First, you need a CEO and senior leadership team that is future-focused. These key people must be good planners, with concern about all the resources they will need in the years ahead-including people. Second, you need human resource professionals who can business-speak, who can understand the strategic plans being drawn by those top executives. These professionals must be able to determine what kinds of people will be needed-when, where, and why. Third, you need a good tool to forecast workforce supply and demand, be flexible in response to changing plans, and be highly usable. &quot;Strategic Staffing&quot; is that tool.<br />Written by a human resource strategist with decades of experience under his belt, this book has it all-in writing and on an accompanying CD-ROM. Included in the easy-to-read pages are forms, examples, and diagnostics to help readers evaluate their own workforce strategies and preparedness. The CD-ROM includes templates, graphs, formulas, Excel spreadsheets, and even slide presentations to convey the vital message to others in the organization. <br />The book is organized into four sections: Setting the Context, Developing the Strategic Staffing Process, Implementing and Supporting Your Strategic Staffing Process, and Beyond Staffing Plans: Analyzing and Applying the Results. Three Appendices add more value, addressing frequently asked questions and providing guidance to using the extra material on the CD-ROM. A glossary and an index contribute to the usefulness of the volume. <br />The sixteen chapters of the book are well-defined, enabling the reader to work from the Table of Contents to move to sections where help might be found for specific problems.  Readers will learn about how to make strategic staffing a part of the organization, how to define staffing levels, and how to make the whole thing work. Included are chapters about how to involve other mangers (buy-in is important) and how to use the web for staff acquisition over the long term. Solid costing information brings a cold sense of reality to the picture. The cost of not doing what this book advises can be considerably higher than following the author's helpful guidelines. <br />Bonus: The book's type size and design makes it easy to read and work with.	2002-08-07

One of my all-time favorite books is Eliahu Goldratt's &quot;The Goal.&quot; As a Certified Management Consultant, I have often recommended the book and its concept of discovering bottlenecks, eliminating them, and moving forward to greater accomplishment. That's the theme of this book, as well, so I was excited about delving into the content. I wasn't disappointed at all.<br />Turning to the Table of Contents, I was concerned that there were only two sections in the book. Somehow, I expected more. Two sections: Free Your Organization from Mind-Forged Manacles and A Stallbuster's Guide in Eight Steps. Hmmm. Is it that easy? The foreword: &quot;The book's fundamental premise is that no matter how successful your organization is, it is performing way below its easily achievable potential.&quot; Whew! Then the authors assert that complacency is the primary reason for the frustrating gap between achievement and potential. Complacency? I want to read more. That feeling crept in throughout the book: I want to read more.<br />The design of the book makes it easy to read. It flows. The authors tell us story after story to illustrate their points. Chapters full of thought-provoking stories. And each chapter starts with an italicized paragraph to help the reader understand the chapter and its importance. The chapters are organized into short sections which make it easy to get the gist and the point. It's like participating in a lively conversation with others who have &quot;been there, done that.&quot; You'll learn from a treasure chest of experiences. An afterword will help get you started by suggesting specific tasks to accomplish. The book is indexed, as well.<br />Stallbusting. The authors contend that there are all sorts of things that cause stalls. Stall. Dictionary definition: to come to a standstill. When that happens, organizations get bogged down, don't make progress, and don't achieve their goals...or potential. In page after page, you will understand what may be getting in your way, pick up ideas, and be inspired to take action to make a difference. Happily, the book is practical, not theoretical, so it will be well-read and well-used. After completing the book, I envision that readers will venture forth to combat stalls and build much more productive organizations. Stallbusters could be the corporate version of the popular film, Ghostbusters. Read, learn, and go get 'em!	2002-08-03

More and more people are talking about balance, life-work balance. A theologian and a corporate executive (a nice balance in itself) got together and wrote a little book that may bring you some serenity and perspective.<br />Life is Not Work is one of those little books you often see next to the cash register in book stores or gift shops. An impulse buy. Except this one is more expensive ... It offers more than just little quotations, though. The little essays, personal stories, make this book a cross between a quote book and a Chicken Soup for the Soul volume. <br />The authors bring us 137 of these short, easy-to-read essays, organized into twenty categories. Listing the categories will give you a sense of the content you'll discover: Balance, Time, Work, Living, Play, Spirituality, Wholeness, Empowerment, Strength, Joy, Stress, Materialism, Repose, Wonder, Nurture, Happiness, Authenticity, Integrity, Community, and Fulfillment. Have I whetted your appetite? Consider the background and perspective of the authors and slide into your easy chair to think about the balance in your life. Forewords from the authors will help you understand who they are and where they're \\"coming from.\\" A bibliography completes the book, giving the reader an extra sense of connection to the messages and their sources.<br />This book will rest comfortably, waiting for its next opportunity, next to the bed in our family's guest room. <br />Be my guest.

The series is designed to showcase current theory and practice in human resources and organizational development. While there are practitioners on the editorial board, this looks like more of an academic series. I'd describe this publication as one for professionals, but a volume that individuals can benefit from, as well.<br />The focus of this book is passionate work. This concept will be difficult for many readers, since passion is emotion and emotion and work are usually considered incongruent. The authors point out, early in the book, that &quot;Passion is at the root of creative genius, personal transformation, and notable events. Passion is emotional energy; it stimulates life and energizes individuals to work toward goals. ...New products, new ideas, creative ways to deliver services, inventions, an scientific discoveries are produced because someone or some organization is passionate.&quot;  OK. Passion seems to be consistent with what we're striving to accomplish in employment organizations today.<br />How might we approach this? The authors explain that they've done some research that connects learning with passion. Put the concepts together and you get meaningfulness, and there are a lot of people looking for opportunities to feel a greater sense of meaning in what they do. Readers will be guided through an interesting study into passion, what it is, how it fits, and what to do with it. Individuals will gain, but trainers and organizational development professionals will find it most thought-provoking and stimulating.<br />The book is organized into eight chapters: Introduction to Passion and Work, The Foundations of Passionate Work, Passion Transformation Process and Cycle, Occupational Intimacy, The Discovering Process, The Designing Process, The Developing Process, and Transforming Work---the five keys to achieving trust, commitment, and passion in the workplace. An index will help you find your way back to those things you want to work with again. A number of exercises are included to stimulate your thinking and help you gain some sense of measurement in the emergence of passion in your personal and corporate life.<br />The book may seem a bit pricey for only a couple hundred pages, but there is a lot packed into those pages. The book is set mostly in 11 point type, so find a nice quiet place with good light to absorb all the authors have to share.	2002-08-03

OK, no-brainer. Arguing with that kind of a statement is like being against Motherhood and Apple Pie. So, there has to be something more to this book. And there is . . . after just a little bit of digging. <br />The book begins with a chapter on the research of what motivates employees. Not much new here. In chapter 2, the author reports the results of her original research into what motivates front-line workers. She surveyed 1200 employees. There is some thought-provoking information here, but nothing dramatic if you've spent much time in this kind of human resources research. For those who have not been exposed to this kind of data, this will be interesting material. <br />The real meat of this book is the author's C.A.R.E. model for motivating and retaining employees. The acronym represents Creative Communication, Atmosphere and Appreciation for All, Respect and Reason for Being,  and Empathy and Enthusiasm. The model is explained, completing Part 1 of the book.<br />Part 2 consist of Ideas and Stories from Managers, Employees, and Organizations Who Care. Some interesting case studies here. Chapter 6 includes a six page list of ideas from employees. Great checklist of reward opportunities. Chapter 7 presents a brief survey used by one company to gain input from employees about what kind of rewards they prefer. <br />In Part 3, the book begins to bubble with value. In over 200 pages, Glanz delivers dozens of ideas, explaining each idea and giving real-life examples of how the ideas are actually implemented in a wide range of employer organizations. Chapter after chapter--full of ideas organized in an easy-to-follow format according to the author's C.A.R.E. formula. This section of the book is the real power which earns this book a good rating. The quality of the content and presentation in this section overcomes the weaker beginning. <br />Four appendices add value, providing self-evaluations for managers (useful for trainers), a sample employee survey, a culture test, and a bibliography. A worthwhile book for managers and supervisors.	2002-08-02

I expected to read yet another business book directed solely toward owners, executives, and managers. This specialized audience will gain quite a lot from this book, but so will &quot;ordinary employees.&quot; 22 Keys is an Everyman's book, written in a tone that encourages focused initiative by all sorts of readers. Not only does this approach add value to the book, it makes it much more salable in bulk to companies interested in changing their work environment.<br />Corporate culture has been defined as &quot;what it feels like to work here.&quot; Terez has captured what people are looking for in today's work environment in his exploration of what it takes to create a meaningful workplace. Before going any further, it's important to list the 22 Keys. As you read this list, pause at each one and think about how it relates to your personal situation. Purpose, Direction, Relevance, Validation, Respect, Equality, Informality, Flexibility, Ownership, Challenge, Invention, Support, Personal Development, Dialogue, Relationship Building, Service, Acknowledgement, Oneness, Self-Identity, Fit, Balance, and Worth.<br />Each key is presented in a chapter heavily seasoned with vignettes that hold the reader's attention. Not all the stories have happy endings, making this book even more valuable. It's not a quick-and-easy-guide-to-Nirvana, but is a realistic presentation. Questions challenge the reader's thinking and, hopefully, stimulate behavior. Actions by others are described to build a sense of confidence that the reader can also do these things and make a difference. <br />The book has a number of features that increase its readability and usefulness. Reality checks at the end of each chapter focus the reader's attention. Did you get the message? Quotations, liberally sprinkled throughout the book, stimulate thought. I felt the author could have done with a few less quotes, but that's a very minor issue. One of the pages I turned down(there were many) marks a quote by Albert Einstein: &quot;Not everything that can be counted counts, but not everything that counts can be counted.&quot; When we're all looking to measure our performance, yet at the same time achieve life-work balance, the quote is meaningful. Ah! Meaningful. The objective of the book: well-achieved. The action plans will help you get started to make a difference in your organization.<br />This book will be around for a while. It fits comfortably with what needs to be done in the world of work-in the private sector, in government, in non-profits, in education. If it isn't on your shelf yet, now is the time to get a copy, read it, and share it.  I read the hardcover edition.	2002-08-01

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Thought-Provoking, Timely, Academic	In the latter half of the 1990s, we witnessed a number of substantial shifts in employment. Workers changed jobs every 2-4 years, on average. Employers weren't any more loyal to their employees either. The relationship between employer and employee was dramatically different than what we had experienced for generations. Attitudes were changing; behavior around employment changed along with the attitudes. <br />These highly significant changes were observed, studied, scrutinized, discussed, and mourned in corporate offices, think tanks, and college campuses across the land. Twenty-two of the folks concerned with the changes and their implications wrote essays expressing their concerns. David Neumark, professor of economics and Michigan State University and research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research wove the essays together into this thought-provoking volume.<br />The fact that fourteen of the authors are professors or researchers should tell you something about the content. Those who are not affiliated with a college, university, or research organization are executives with organizations involved in the field as consultants. The book understandably has a strong academic flavor, clear evidence of the research-and-publish culture still prevalent in the academic world. This orientation brings a considerable depth to each of the essays, duly noted in graphs, charts, and footnotes.<br />The book is organized into three sections: Job Stability, Job Security, and Understanding Behavioral Changes. Chapters include such titles as Is Job Stability in the United States Falling?, Trends in Job Instability and Wages for Young Adult Men, and Has Job Stability Vanished in Large Corporations? More can be found in chapters titled Declining Job Security, Long-Run Trends in Part-Time and Temporary Employment, and The Implications of Flexible Staffing Arrangements for Job Stability.<br />While this certainly isn't bedside reading for most of us, for serious human resource professionals, social scientists, workforce strategists, and other professors, it's great. Good contribution to the literature, but won't be a best-seller.	2002-07-28

Personal issues, varying perspectives, separate agendas, labor issues, and mental difficulties. When conflict escalates to violence-from shouting to shooting, it's time to start paying attention to the problem. <br />Marick Masters is the Executive Director of the Center on Conflict Resolution and Negotiation at the University of Pittsburgh. Robert Albright is also a professor in the field and both have done their share of corporate consulting. They obviously know their topic. The author suggest that conflict occupies thirty percent of a manager's time, so streamlining the process of dealing with conflict-and improving effectiveness-can be a significant value for an employer. <br />This book is worthwhile as a read-through and as a reference text. Executives, human resource professionals, consultants, and behavioral scientists working in the organizational arena will be delighted with the presentation of the material. It's surprisingly readable and, thanks to some good design, is easy on the eyes. Decent-sized type and open leading are a welcome benefit.<br />The book is organized into five parts. The first, appropriately, Getting a Handle on Workplace Conflict, has chapters on understanding, diagnosing, and dealing with conflict. The second section explores alternative resolution methods: negotiation, facilitation, mediation, arbitration, and potpourri. Lots of understandings here. Part 3, Special Topics, gets into Confronting Workplace Violence, EEO Disputes, Unions, and international issues. Part 4 takes the reader through the how-to of establishing an Integrated Conflict Resolution System, Education, and Training. The last section provides a brief map and guide, summarizing the essence of the book. <br />There are two appendices in this publication. The first gives the solutions to the twenty exercises in the chapters. The other offers a simulation of an EEO Mediation. The source list isa special treasure-a dozen pages of books, journals, web sites, and government publications to open more doors to learning for readers. <br />Everything you wanted to know in this field-if it's important in the workplace-is between the covers of this book. Certainly recommended for those responsible for keeping conflict at a minimum in any organization.	2002-07-28

And the list goes on. Capitalism is practically a dirty word. Conversations in board rooms, executive suites, universities, and other environments of though wrestle with how corporations can pull themselves out of the quicksand of questionable integrity. Hilton and Gibbons have a few suggestions.<br />The authors are the founders (1997) of a British consulting firm that specializes in social marketing. They've built an enviable track record already working with a range of clients including Coca-Cola and Nike. Their position is that companies should start becoming the solution to the world's problems instead of being seen as the cause. By using their power for social good, they can influence environment issues, human rights, and social justice. <br />Seven chapters carry the message: Orthodoxy, Heresy, Responsibility, Leadership, Anatomy, Possibility, and Unity. Intrigued? Prepare to read an interesting book filled with examples and stories about how business became so unpopular, but really isn't so bad after all. The heresy chapter tells the other side of the story that is pounded at us through the media: globalization makes the poor richer, corporations are good for human rights, and we can close sweatshops and end child labor. Under Responsibility, the authors explore how corporations respond to all this criticism and how they can be truly socially responsible. Leadership is needed-real leadership, not just lip service. Commercialism, profit, and social good can all live together in harmony. The authors offer some ideas about what business could do to make a real difference and how ordinary citizens can join the movement for common good. <br />This is an almost conversational book that is comfortable to read. You'll gain some new perspectives and perhaps some inspiration.	2002-07-28

A specialist in strategic planning, he emphasizes the careful use of tools such as scenario planning. <br />The book is a valuable contribution to the literature of serious-really serious-strategic planners. It will be most appreciated by those who have a very strong scientific bent and are comfortable working with models. Godet's approach is considerably more rigorous than futures-thinking approaches applied in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The concept of the book is very long-range, evidenced by quotes like &quot;the faster the car, the stronger the headlights must be&quot; and &quot;the longer a tree takes to grow, the earlier you have to plant it.&quot; English-speaking futurists tend to look more short-range and medium-range with more of an application of intuition mixed with scientific research. <br />Americans have become accustomed to engaging in quite a bit of internet research to gather information needed for evaluation, decision-making, and planning. Godet describes the internet as &quot;a computerized dumpster,&quot; all the while acknowledging that one may still find gold in a dump. <br />This book is complex and slow reading. The content is &quot;heavy.&quot; Nine chapters are followed by a bibliography and index. The first five chapters are titled How to Think About the Future Now, Why Do the Experts Get it Wrong, Hunting Down Cliches, How to be Rigorous with Scenario Planning, and Initiating the Entire Process. The balance of the book, save the last chapter on The Human Factor, consists of case studies.<br />Good marks for content. Marks off for not making the learning a bit easier to move through. If you're not a real pro-or aspiring pro-in strategic planning, save your time and money.	2002-07-27

Life isn't like that, so the key is to avoid the problems. This book will help salespeople-at all levels-gain some better perspectives on their roles. <br />The stories about the sales situation blunders are short and sweet. The author wastes no time in getting to the point. And each story has a point-a moment of instruction, if you will. The book is organized by the type of story, the category of failure: dinosaur, tourist, Napoleon, and maverick. You may recognize yourself in every section of the book! The funniest, craziest stories are probably the ones with the most value.<br />Adding value are contributions from recognized sales authorities and authors who provide insightful pieces-again short enough to be absorbed by busy sales professionals who have precious little time for reading. Other pieces, which almost seem like chapters tacked on to put a little more in the book, do add extra value.<br />While this is not a step-by-step instruction book to fine salesmanship (it's not intended to be), it's filled with food for thought. Nourishing without being one of those rah-rah motivational books. Written by a professional sales trainer and speaker who hasn't seen it all, but has seen enough to provide us with some more valuable learning. You'll enjoy it.	2002-07-26

After seeing what happened to properties in New York City on September 11, 2001, the professional association serving managers of real estate prepared a manual as a guide for their members. <br />This book is intended for people managing any kind of property-office buildings, apartment buildings, public buildings, schools, churches, and other structures that may be vulnerable to a terrorist attack, directly or indirectly. These managers must be able to assess their exposure, understand the problems they may face, and be prepared to respond to whatever happens. To accomplish these objectives, they need knowledge, plans, and preparation. This book tells those specialists everything they need to know . . . and then some. <br />As I read this book, I was struck with the depth and breadth of the information presented. Many readers will be overwhelmed and will have to slow their reading pace to absorb it all. Personally, I had a bit of an advantage: the first two books I wrote as an author, back in the early 1980s, were in the field of local government disaster planning. Even with my level of knowledge, I was highly impressed with the strength of this volume. <br />The book is organized into seven sections: Introduction to Terrorism, Responding to Terrorist Acts, Building Procedures, Training the Building's Staff, Training the Building's Residential and Commercial Tenants, Building Recovery, and Publications and Resources. The 18 chapters cover everything from attacks against individuals to fire, bomb threats, civil disturbances, chemical and biological agents, elevator emergencies, nuclear and radiological attacks, and evacuations. There's some good material on how to write emergency plans, build and train an emergency response team, and function to protect the property and people in and around it.<br />This is a powerful book that shouldbe read-and followed-by every property manager in America. Now. Even if you skip some parts, whatever you learn will put you in a considerably better position than you're probably in today.	2002-07-20

Here's another one of those books by authors who have had a rough life. The theme is the same as most of the books in this category: &quot;If I can do it, you can do it.&quot; <br />This book is different. More than a challenge book, this one is a moving, emotional autobiography that will fill your heart with admiration and a desire to do something for others. The movie, Pay It Forward, came to mind several times as I hungrily read page after page. I just didn't want to put the book down. Several times, while reading &quot;Never Give Up!&quot; on an airplane, the emotion welled up strongly enough to bring tears to my eyes and a &quot;catch&quot; in my heart. I have not read many books that grabbed me and held me as this one did. <br />Ron Heagy is a quadriplegic. He's seriously handicapped physically, but powerfully strong spiritually. His love of God was present before his life-changing experience when he was 18 (no, I won't spoil your reading by telling you what happened), but became considerably stronger over the years. Even if you are not a deep believer, you will be impressed by how Ron's faith has made a tremendous difference for him. <br />Today, Ron Heagy makes a difference in the lives of other people as a motivational speaker and a leader in service to the disabled community. As you read about what he has accomplished, as he shares his story, you will be thankful that Ron and others like him are around to influence us. I was inspired by his struggle, but perhaps even more moved by what he has done in spite of potentially overwhelming odds.<br />This autobiography is filled with 39 chapters, an average of seven pages long, each sharing a chapter in the author's life. Co-author Donita Dyer, who helped shape this awesome story into book form, did a masterful job. We are right with Ron, inside his head and his heart, as he moves from one experience to another on a roller-coaster ride of a life. You can't help being thoroughly engaged in this story, as an individual, as a member of society, and as someone who influences the lives of others every day. There are several aspects of this book that will be particularly valuable for corporate executives, teachers, and others who are looked up to because of who they are . . . or should be.<br />Warning: You won't be able to put this book down until you finish it. Then you'll want to give it to someone else close to you to read.  This valuable book is priced low enough that it can easily be given as a gift. Buy several copies.	2002-07-20

Push, push, push. Gotta achieve. Gotta make it! Life is complicated, but that's the fun. Go go go!<br />So is this what achievement is all about? Not really, say these authors. There's a system for success, and it's simple. In fact, simplicity in life is part of the magic. But it all starts inside. As the book explains, &quot;what's in the well comes up in the bucket.&quot;<br />This is an interesting book because it's written by three authors-three people who have &quot;been there, done that, and taught others.&quot; But the book is written in the singular. The authors realized that their ideas were bouncing all over the place, so they engaged a writer to &quot;harmonize them into one voice.&quot; Clever idea, but a little unnerving at times, knowing that there are three people behind the message. <br />Readers will begin the journey through this book by Defining Success. Chapter 2 talks about Creating Desired Results, with the obligatory four-quadrant model. The dimensions of this one are Failure and Success, Frustration and Fulfillment. The Impact of Thoughts, Words, and Actions is explored in the third chapter. Values are addressed in a chapter entitled &quot;Reflecting on Your Belief System&quot; before an advisory chapter on getting clutter out of your life. The balance of the book focuses on creating an environment for success. It's a &quot;typical&quot; self-help book, but well put together. <br />Extra features include the inspirational quotes you might expect, sprinkled through the pages. A 19-question assessment at the back of the book serves as a summary, but could also be taken before reading the book as a sort of benchmark. The Points to Ponder at the end of each chapter add value to this book, moving the reader from absorption of good advice to a pensive and self-reflection mode to stimulate progress.	2002-07-11

Security issues were already high on corporate and personal agendas; 9/11 just kicked them higher with a jolt. Security would now be considerably more pro-active than merely routinely defensive.<br />This book, one of the first to be rushed to the bookstores, was written by a woman with expertise on the internet-software, e-commerce, information management. Her research for this book, probably rapid, centered on those areas of familiarity, so the content is technologically heavy. This focus is understandable, acceptable, and worthwhile-and is where the reader will find the greatest value. <br />From the preface, \\"This book does more than identify the potential vulnerabilities\\" It givrs you specific strategies and technologies to lock down and free up valuable resources. Each chapter takes you through a problem that has arisen in this new, less secure world. It then suggests specific strategies and technologies based on interviews with the nation's leading experts . . . each chapter ends with a resource guide.\\" The author promises to continue expanding her resource guide at her website. There's nothing there yet, but it's a nice extra if it happens.<br />Part I addresses how to keep employees safe, acknowledging that safe employees are more productive than those who continually look over their shoulders. The author suggests that we overcome travel fears with virtual meetings and training, sell through the internet, and use collaborative project management software to keep people connected. Is this new? No, but the emphasis on the applications is-reactively to 9/11. If we perceived the risk to be high and continuous, these technologies would get more use. It may be, until the economy picks up, that these alternatives will be employed as cost-savers.<br />Part 2 is entitled \\"What if Your Employees and Customers Are Afraid to Open the Mail?, an obvious response to the Anthrax scare. Gutzman instructs her readers about electronic direct and transactional mail, eBilling and ePayments systems. A number of companies have been sticking their toes into the water with these techniques; Gutzman uses 9/11 as an impetus to suggest we might to more in these areas-for security reasons. <br />Part 3 looks at how to protect your place of business and your data. For a lot of business operators, there are some intriguing ideas here. You'll learn about biometrics technology, network security, encryption, system security. There's a chapter on using ASPs and MSPs to decrease dependence on physical plant. Understanding that this book is written by an author with recognized expertise in these issues, expect to gain some interesting insights.<br />The book closes with an almost obligatory chapter on succession planning. Yes, we all know that succession planning is important, but it seems force-fit into this book. I'd recommend this book if you want to dig into the technological aspects of operating more safely and effectively in an uncertain world. The book will be a valuable reference and check-list for those already somewhat familiar with the topic, but I expect that all readers will pick up some new ideas regardless of their level of technological sophistication.	2002-07-06

We could expect all sorts of quality in content and production. The AMACOM contribution is worth reading, sharing, and keeping.<br />The author is a veteran business journalist, management consultant, and speaker-the kind of person you'd expect to be able to communicate with respected leaders and draw out their thoughts, their feelings, and their advice. At a time that solid perspectives are needed, this book provides them.<br />Let's talk about content first-the people who contributed to this work through their interviews. One might expect the customary parade of overpaid CEOs whose public relations agents seek more opportunities to gain image-building exposure. All the major companies would be represented, including the ones that are flaming out because of deficiencies in the very leadership that we need.<br />Surprise! The interviewees are much more diverse, not always the top dog, and some are even retired. They're included in the book because they have something worthwhile to say...and be heard. While including lists like this are not particularly recommended in book reviews, I feel it's appropriate in this case. Their interviews, incidentally, are presented in alphabetical order to avoid suggesting that any is more important than another.<br />You'll learn from Grant Aldonas, Under Secretary, International Trade, US Department of Commerce; John Alexander, President, Center for Creative Leadership; Charles Barclay, President, American Association of Airport Executives; Curtis Carlson, CEO &amp; President, SRI International; Michael Carns, General (retired), US Air Force; Peggy Conlon, CEO &amp; President of the Ad Council; Leo Daly III, Chairman &amp; President, Leo O.

As familiar as we all are with e-mail and chat room threads, this book is easy to read. The interviewer's question is shown in one type style, followed by the response in another. Reading this book is like reading a series of well-edited e-mail messages. This is a book you can get into . . . and get hooked on.<br />One more selling point, in my estimation, is the index. Just reading through the indexed topics is a lesson unto itself, to see what topical areas were addressed most frequently.<br />Diversity, depth, and determination make this book. The diversity of the participants, the depth of their remarks, and the determination of the author deliver for the reader.	2002-06-30

As a Certified Management Consultant, I hear clients complain about &quot;communications&quot; so much, I've dubbed it the &quot;C Word.&quot; <br />What's the problem? People aren't real, open, honest, direct, and thorough in their conversations with each other. Hidden agendas, inability to say what you mean, fear of consequences and more problems contribute to the debilitating &quot;mush&quot; that inhibits organizational achievement. We've certainly seen enough evidence of the problem in the serious problems reported in the newspapers in recent months. And more corporate crises are in the works because the people at the top are not providing clear leadership-clear, &quot;real&quot; communication. And if the role models aren't working, the rest of the bureaucratic system is in trouble. <br />Bushe, a PhD consultant and professor of business administration, has given us a fine tool in &quot;Clear Leadership.&quot; This is the kind of book that can be read and enjoyed, almost like a corporate novel. He communicates his message with a well-organized presentation supplemented by a wonderful collection of vignettes. The illustrative stories really bring this book to life, stimulate the thinking, and teach the lessons. As emotional beings, we all relate well to story-telling; this book has a good mix to help the reader get the message. I gained insight from the first two stories! Good stuff!<br />The author's objective is to teach the skills that build clarity and agreement. To quote from the book, &quot;Clarity comes from clearing out the interpersonal mush and sometimes requires an organizational learning conversation. This is a conversation where people level with each other about their experience so that they can learn about anad change the troublesome patterns they find themselves in. Agreement comes from the ability of a group to think together and make decisions.&quot;<br />&quot;Clear Leadership&quot; is organized into three sections, plus a valuable introduction and an inspiring conclusion. Part One is Clarity and Mush in Organizational Life. Part Two, The Four Selves of Clear Leaders, has chapters on the Aware, Descriptive, Curious, and Appreciative aspects of the concept. Part Three, Clear Leadership at Work is filled with practical advice to putting this valuable concept into practice. <br />A lot of knowledge, insight, and advice packed into 250 pages. It's the kind of book you'll want to share with others-maybe simultaneously-to build clear leadership in your organization.	2002-06-30

It caught my attention, so I brought it home to read. A 1990 book? Is there any current value here? <br />What fun! Jeanne Robertson is a sought-after professional speaker who is a humorist. I've heard her speak and this book brought all the laughs to life! There are some instructive aspects to the book and some fascinating storytelling, but the humor that is woven throughout the text kept me up very late at night. I didn't want to put the book down, I was having such a good time reading page after page. <br />Couldn't finish the whole book. There was just too much and it was just too late. But the next night, I went to bed early just so I could read this book some more. Jeanne is a tall Southern lady who just has a lot of fun with who she is and how people respond to a 6'2&quot; woman (160 pounds still) with size 11 feet. In her earlier years, she was Miss North Carolina and competed in the Miss America Pagent. She &quot;earned&quot; the Miss Congeniality title! <br />The stories will have you laughing out loud. If you can find a copy of this book somewhere, it will be worth your time to read and enjoy it. And, no, you can't have my copy. I'm going to keep it to loan to friends who need a pick-me-up.	2002-06-20

When you're an adult, coloring outside the lines, out of the box thinking, and challenging the status quo can be really difficult. The old tapes come on and hold you within established boundaries. Creativity is a useless exercise: it's outside the limits. And that's our problem. We're all so bound by limits, we can't find new solutions. We're stuck with the old solutions, even though the problems, the playing field, and the rules have changed. And the tape plays on.<br />It is said that if you tie an elephant to a stake with a thin rope when it's young, the elephant learns that it is secured to that stake. The learned behavior &quot;sticks,&quot; enabling handlers to secure huge, powerful elephants to stakes with thin ropes. The elephant doesn't believe it can break free. Humans are not so different.<br />Then Jeff Tobe comes along and shatters all those imaginary boundaries. A salesman and professional speaker, he specializes in stimulating creativity and innovation in business organizations. As demonstrated by his stories in this book Tobe helps companies break through &quot;innovation deficiency,&quot; characterized by Internal Myopia and the Ostrich Syndrome. He argues that business leaders-and everyone else in the environment-must change the way they perceive, think, and behave to succeed in today's competitive world. <br />You get an immediate sense that this book is going to be a bit different when you open the cover. There is no traditional Times New Roman type between these covers. The typeface--throughout the entire book--looks like something from a primary school primer on the fine art of printed word penmanship. The message is clear: this book is going to be different and fun. And it is, but it's serious, too.<br />&quot;Coloring Outside the Lines&quot; is organized into three sections: Creativity, Marketing, and Sales. Each section has6-9 chapters that stimulate the thinking and illustrate how things can be done differently. The lessons are valuable-some are fresh and some are the old saws that we've all learned for years. Each lesson is presented in the context of a story that you might hear on a fun walk through a meadow with the author. The chapters are filled with personal stories and experiences with titles like &quot;Are Your Bagels Hot?&quot; to &quot;Step into My Office.&quot; These narratives are enjoyable (yup, chuckles in this book), comfortable and reasonable, yet highly instructive. The book is deceivingly simple in appearance; the educational aspect sort of sneaks up on you. <br />This easy-to-read volume will be thought-provoking and stimulating for salespeople, marketers, and other executives and managers who welcome inspiration (or permission) to do things just a little bit differently. If the thinking and behavior or different, (surprise!) the outcomes are different.	2002-06-20
US	52870090	RHQU2HSFGPMNK	1552124592	384223618	The Churchill Factors: Creating Your Finest Hour	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Missed Opportunity, Uncomfortably Commercial	Churchill was, without question, a fine man and example for us to follow. Learning more about Churchill, what made him great, and how he influenced history is a worthy endeavor. <br />Being motivated and inspired to pursue higher objectives in life, to really make a difference in the world is also a worthy endeavor. Emulating features of Churchill's life to craft your own success is also worthwhile.<br />As I began this book, I found myself reading sections to my wife. Good stuff here! The author's own words as well as the quotes from Churchill and other luminaries were getting my attention. I began to understand why several of my friends are such devoted students of Churchill and his influence. The first 37 pages were great.<br />Then Chapter 5 hit me like a bucket of ice water. I discovered to my astonishment that the author is also a distributor of behavioral style learning materials produced by Inscape Publishing. Most of the balance of the book is a description of the four principal behavioral styles and how various aspects of Churchill's attributes relate to the styles. I was tempted to toss the book away as a blatant commercial for Inscape products. There was nothing on the cover of the book, in the introduction, or in the title that suggested that this was the kind of book I discovered . . . unless you look closely at the category on the back cover and note that the words &quot;SELF HELP&quot; follow &quot;BUSINESS.&quot;<br />The four behavioral styles of drivers, influencers, supporters, and conceptualizers were each presented with some explanation. Churchill's traits were related to each, apparently to validate for persons with each style that they, too, can be like Churchill. I felt some were rather force-fit. As a disclosure, I have used Inscape instruments and behavioral style knowledge for two decades and am a former national contract trainer for the company; I am quite familiar with the products and their philosophies.<br />At the end of the book isa blatant promotion for a wide range of Inscape products. For those readers who are interested in learning more about behavioral styles, it's helpful to have this catalog available. For those who were really interested in what made Churchill great-from an author touted as a Churchill expert, it's offensive.<br />I almost rated this book with three stars instead of four (out of five), but there is some good content. Kryske does relate some strong material, particularly in the forepart of the book before he got into the behavioral styles. The book is heavily seasoned with quotes (as call-outs); there's a quote from someone on almost every page. Many of the quotes are from Churchill, but also cited are other historical figures and present-day motivational speakers.	2002-06-16

He and his colleagues at SRC (Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation) have built a company and set of business practices (Great Game of Business) around the concept of sharing numbers with your employees. Yes, it's more than just sharing numbers, it's empowering the employees to be true team members, enabling them to take personal and collective actions to influence the numbers and to share in the profits. <br />Open book management is a great concept that has made a significant difference for a lot of companies, and even the U. S. Coast Guard. Stack presented the concept in his 1992 book, &quot;The Great Game of Business&quot; (Currency Doubleday). That book was a valuable how-to package.<br />&quot;A Stake in the Outcome&quot; is more of the story of the transformation of a remanufacturing plant owned by a large corporation into a thriving independent business. In the midst of the text, the reader will find some advice, some brief case studies of other companies, and some experience descriptions that may be instructive. But, when it all shakes out, this is the story of the growth of a business. It's an historical review with plenty of detail. It's Jack Stack's story.<br />If you're looking for an instruction book of how to build an employee-centered open book management company, this isn't it. If you're looking for an instructive report of what one company went through, from the leader's perspective, this book fits that description. It's Jack Stack's book, even though Bo Burlingham, an editor-at-large of Inc. Magazine, is shown as co-author. Burlingham's photo doesn't appear on the dust jacket, just Stack's. <br />Reading the book is like listening to Stack telling his story, with the emotion, the ego, the pride, and the rough-and-tumble. It would be interesting to hear this story shared by others. You can gain that experience by visiting SRC in Springfield, Missouri, butyou can't get it from this book.	2002-06-16

The publisher, Leading Authorities, is one of the leading speakers bureaus in North America. The firm serves corporations, trade associations, and other organizations in procuring just the speaker(s) they need for their events. In this work, they interact daily with people hungry for information, advice, and inspiration-and with the people who deliver just what those audiences seek. The role of the Leading Authorities Speakers Bureau is to successfully match the right speaker with the need.<br />In this book, probably the first of a series, the speakers bureau has ventured into putting into print what some of their most effective speakers convey from the speaking platform. The theme of this book is business-winning strategies for business. The essays are all focused on delivering valuable, useful information and advice for the reader. Mission accomplished. <br />Reading this book is like experiencing a focused set of powerful professional speakers at a major convention . . . while sitting in the comfort of your living room. Well, not quite. No convention would ever give you the opportunity to receive the messages of 34 (count 'em-34) experts in one sitting. In fact, with the power in some of the chapters, it may be difficult to handle this book in one sitting! <br />Some of the names of the speaker-authors won't be easily recognizable. Others will be very familiar to people who know their work, have heard them speak, or work in their fields. Regardless, every one has a message for the reader. The book is organized into four parts: Toward the Future, Learning to Lead, The Impact of Technology, and Processes, Strategies, and Techniques of Leadership. There are no illustrations in this book. It's straight text . . . and straightforward. Even if you just pick a few chapters that interest you, reading this book will be worth the price. <br />Idea: Buy a copy of this book for each member of your leadership team. Assign a particular chapter for everyone to read at the same time, then discuss what was learned and how the knowledge can be applied in your organization. Then move to another chapter, and another. If one of the chapters seems particularly important, engage the author to speak at your management meeting.<br />Note: This book is not a commercial for the speakers bureau. In fact, I couldn't even find a reference to the bureau in the book. This is knowledge that I have--being a professionla speaker myself--and share with you so you can appreciate the power in this book. Definitely worth reading.	2002-06-16

Those not educated and engaged in the field will find the text slow reading, but loaded with information and insight. OD types will enjoy this volume, as will thought leaders in the human resource profession. It will also be well-received by futurists and strategists interested in gaining knowledge about life in the Information Age environment. Information Technology professionals will also find the book of interest . . . and validating. <br />I have given this book a Five Star rating because, for the intended market, that's certainly the ranking it deserves. For the general public, including business executives, the book will be slow reading, but with frequent gems to highlight or write down.<br />The book is organized into five sections: Setting the Stage, The New Strategic Basics, Collaborative Challenges, HR, OD, and Information Technology, and Conclusions and Implications. The first section is written by the editor, Stan Herman (no relation to the reviewer), who presents Uncertainty is Unavoidable, Technology, and Commerce are the Key Drivers of Organizational Change, and Three Imperatives of Change Derived from Information Technology.<br />Part Two contains three chapters, each written by a different contributor: Strategic Navigation: Learning Viability in a World Wired for Speed, Strategic Conversations in the Networked Economy, and Inside the AOL Experience. Part Three also includes three chapters each written by a different author: Virtual Teamwork, Ready for Virtuality: A Case, and The Whole System Transformation Conference: Fast Change for the 21st Century.<br />In Part 4, the first chapter presents Basic Info-Tech for Consultants. The second chapter, HR and IR: Metamorphosis and Opportunities delves into some practical aspects of dealing with the issues of telecommuting, e-learning, knowledge management, e-cruiting (internet-based recruiting), and approaches to HR/IT integration. These topics will be &quot;hot&quot; in the near future as both HR and IT cope with the problem of how to not just get along, but be happily intertwined. I was glad to see this chapter included, lending a bit of a pragmatic strength to the book. While there isn't a lot of how-to in this representative chapter that caught my attention, there's enough for HR, IT, and OD professionals to advance their work. A case study contributes to the &quot;this is real world&quot; aspect, but this book is oriented toward raising issues to be explored in organizations, rather than to offer step-by-step solutions. The chapter includes references to web sites and other resources to help readers go deeper. Chapter author Jana Markowitz offers insights into emerging roles in organizations-Chief Learning Officer, Chief Knowledge Officer-as she explores some of the changes underway in today's corporations.<br />Organizational life is moving at a rapid rate. Technology is indeed a powerful driver, so those leaders concerned with the human side of the enterprise should read this book to gain a deeper understanding of what's happening . . . and what they might do to help their organizations through the evolution to a new way of operating. They'll discover some pioneering ideas, some practical guidance, and a look at some of the theory behind some major shifts in our corporate world.	2002-05-27

If not, don't bother; you won't understand or appreciate it. The book is best read slowly, carefully, and analytically...with highlighter or notepad close at hand. You will find each chapter through-provoking, inspirational, and stimulating. Savvy readers will be motivated to initiate specific actions before even completing the book. <br />&quot;Good to Great&quot; is actually, in the author's mind, a prequel to his best-selling &quot;Built to Last.&quot; It's a research-based report of what it takes to move from being a good company to a great company. His focus is on organizations that have sustained great results for at least 15 years. The selection criteria, explained in the book, were tough. The book examines companies that moved from mediocrity to extraordinary performance, exploring how they did it and what common lessons might be learned. <br />Is this usable information for your company? Collins asserts &quot;Our five-year quest yielded many insights, a number of them surprising and quite contrary to conventional wisdom, but one giant conclusion stands out above the others: We believe that almost any organization can substantially improve its stature and performance, perhaps even become great, if it conscientiously applies the framework of ideas we've uncovered.&quot; <br />The chapters are organized according to what Collins and his researchers learned makes companies great: Good is the Enemy of Great, Level 5 Leadership, First Who, then What, Confront the Brutal Facts, Hedgehog Concept, Culture of Discipline, and Technology Accelerators. The book moves then to explain the flywheel and doom loop concepts that enable the other factors to either enable the company build momentum to high achievement or wind down to a whimper and drop off the radar screen. Closing the book, Collins relates this work to his previous work reported in &quot;Built to Last.&quot; The Frequently Asked Questions epiloguehelps tighten the readers' focus, as do the summaries at the end of each chapter. There are several research appendices for those who wish to look behind the curtain.<br />This is a powerful book with a wealth of messages about how the eleven Great Companies did it. Example follows example, with painfully simple methodology. Amazingly, most executives and managers get in their own way, making it impossible for them to make the leap from good to great. The companies Collins used to compare against his chosen few suffered from that dilemma, and Collins names names to tell the story of exactly what happened-or didn't happen. Expect to be a bit embarrassed by what you have done or not done, but at the same time educated about what you need to do now. <br />You may not agree with everything you read in &quot;Good to Great,&quot; but you'll think. And you'll act. And that makes a book powerful. This is a book you'll recommend to others.	2002-05-25

Leaders are supposed to lead change, but many don't know how. This book will give them some insight to do a better job at building individual and organizational capacity for the evolving nature of change.<br />The book is organized into four sections: Nature and Response to Change, Building the Capacity to Spring Back and Survive, Organizational Components, and Time to Change. A bibliography and appendices add to the value of this little volume. A number of charts are provided for the reader to complete to organize the leadership process and follow through. <br />During the first two chapters, the reader gains a good knowledge of what change is all about, including natural human responses to change. As Bennett launches into his explanation, he tells us about his grandmother and about Maggie, a sort of girl-next-door near grandmother's place. Maggie is a manager coping with change in her organization and Granny . . . well, she's a grandmother filled with wisdom. These characters are used to teach and to offer case studies, adding a smoothness to what might otherwise be just another difficult-to-read leadership book. <br />Interacting as a consultant (Bennett is a Certified Management Consultant), the author coaches Maggie on how to work with her colleagues who relate to change in different ways. This process makes the book comfortably instructive. <br />In the second section of the book, the focus is on resilience, a concept not often found in books on change. We're all &quot;hit&quot; by change, but the key to good leadership and success is how we bounce back from the impacts of change or adversity. A major key is to avoid extinction (hear the dinosaur?) by being flexible and adaptable. Bennett warns that we are all potential dinosaurs; due diligence is in order!<br />The balance of the book is filled with information and ideas that will reinforce what you know and provoke some creative thinking. The Herrmann Brain Dominance concepts are interwoven to add a different dimension to the leadership-oriented content.<br />Graphs and charts are thrown in to help the reader grasp the knowledge graphically . . . and to have lots of forms to complete to manage your leadership of change. <br />Then I got my surprise. I was just about finished with the book, thinking it was a good leadership book. There are so many out there. Then, on page 85 I hit &quot;Bibliography and Resources.&quot; I almost flipped by it until I realized what a tremendous treasure John Bennett has given us! Over four pages of listings that reads like the List of Recommended Readings for several graduate courses. What a rich resource! I couldn't resist. I counted. 65.<br />This is a book that will really open your learning about leading change. It's the key to a treasure chest.	2002-05-12

The first-a biggie-was that AMACOM, a revered and respected publisher of business books, would stoop to this level. Publication of this book may have begun as a joke, then accidentally slipped through the system.<br />My second surprise was that I read as far into the book as I did. I kept reading, hoping that each page turn would produce something of lasting value or some really good humor. I was almost consistently disappointed. I made it more than halfway through the book, then just gave up. <br />OK, the book is a satire. A satire of the good business books published by outfits like AMACOM. Agreed, some of the business books today do make readers shake their heads, wondering where the authors had theirs? The book is categorized as \\"humor/business,\\" an interesting classification that I have not seen in bookstores. An oxymoron, to be sure. <br />The flow of the book is jerky and disconnected, like a bad comedian's attempt at a monologue. While there are some funny things in the book, I shook my head a lot more than I laughed. If written as a satire, this book could have been more effectively done. <br />The authors do begin with a disclaimer: \\"This book is satire, pure and simple. It is written in a superior, all-knowing tone, the persona of which the authors take on to further the satire and poke gentle fun at ourselves. The authors don't really think they know everything, or even much of anything, and they are both very nice guys. Everything in this book is a joke and should be taken as such.\\" <br />I accept their disclaimer, but still feel like I endured far too much verbal slapstick. But, this is me. And you may have time for this kind of a read. I'm surprised I took as much time as I did, but reviewers should make that investment to be fair. I'm surprised I'm writing such a long review, but I feel you should be warned. You may agree that there are better places to spend [money]  All that said, if you assume that AMACOM does monitor its quality and reputation, buy the book. But don't say I didn't warn you!

Business, personal-it doesn't matter. You have it or you don't. And if you have it, your chances of being on top are consistently better than if you fall haplessly into the category of the clueless.<br />An amazing number of people show up for work each day, go through the motions, do what they think is right, and go home. They simply &quot;attend&quot; work. Then there are those who mysteriously &quot;get it&quot; and move through the bureaucratic maze like a knife through butter. They seem to have something special, something that sets them apart. Out in the real world, we'd call it &quot;street smarts.&quot; In the closed world of the workplace, it's &quot;organization smarts.&quot; Got it? If not, read this book.<br />David Brown has been there, done that, and probably still wears the tee shirt-but it won't show where you can see it. He's moved from job to job in the fast moving worlds of corporations, politics, government (Deputy Mayor of New York), and higher education. If you wanted to find a mentor, a coach, to draw from, here he is. So, curl up at his feet and learn the secrets to success in the organizational environment.<br />Five chapters. Organized, tight, together. Not complicated. Chapter 1 takes us right into Understanding the &quot;Real&quot; Organization. Moving from sources of information (official and unofficial), Brown dives right into the culture, the customs, and the power. Now that we know the territory, Brown shifts to us: Establishing a Credible Reputation. Learn about things you should know-like first impressions, who you're seen with, and living your reputation so you're real. Chapter Three delves into Understanding What Others Want, a powerful concept in organizational success. Meetings, negotiations, commitment from others. <br />Chapter 4 addressesan interesting aspect of organizational maneuvering: working with experts. Brown emphasizes the importance of learning from experts, gaining and building on knowledge and skills from all sources. Chapter 5 explores the most difficult application of organizational smarts: changing the status quo. Changes often have to be made to move an organization ahead. Identifying needs for change and engaging in the conversations and tasks to accomplish those changes in ways that everyone is happy can put you in an influential position in an organization.<br />This book is recommended for college graduates entering the real world of work, for people who have been &quot;floating&quot; in organizations without realizing their potential, and for up and coming leaders who want to &quot;up-and-come&quot; faster and more effectively.	2002-04-28

There are those who are very comfortable investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and a host of other vehicles that can earn lots of money . . . or not. Then there are those who are chicken-afraid of making the wrong decision, losing their shirts, and suffering the ridicule of everyone who knows them. This book is written for chickens.<br />Fred Siegel is president of an investment management firm in New Orleans, widely respected for knowing the investment field very well. In addition to running his advisory firm, Siegel also runs The Siegel Group International, providing financial news analysis to broadcast media in the United States and other countries. He has been on the air continually since 1984, broadcasting from WWL-TV and WWL radio in New Orleans. His advice is heard far and wide-and can now be read in a fun sort of book.<br />Fun? Investing? Chickens? Scary. The book is written in a light vein so it's easy to move through. The type is large, so that readers don't have to squint to get his message. There are several unusual features in the book-like red and black ink on the pages. Illustrations of chickens abound. There are lots of call-outs and sidebars, including testimonial quotes from his clients. The book is almost too self-serving in that regard, but one might expect a talk-show personality to be a bit self-promoting. <br />The book is organized into twelve chapters, dealing with the stock market, jargon, and then the focus on chicken stocks. Siegel makes his point that buying particular types of stocks is wiser than buying others, and explains. He doesn't like mutual funds, but talks about them, trusts, bonds, and annuities. Even on-line investing is covered for the reader.<br />As you might suspect, this book is going to give you a &quot;once over lightly.&quot; It's not really deep, nor does it need to be. It meets its design of giving chicken investors enough knowledge to feel comfortable looking more deeply into the opportunities. As with any investment advisor, it's smart to take the advice carefully and understand that biases are present and influential. Whether you agree with everything Siegel says or not, you will have a broader understanding of the world of investing after reading this book.	2002-04-24

As the world shrinks, through improved communication and speed, the more people you know, the stronger you are. You have greater strength to get things accomplished when you &quot;know someone&quot; who can help you down the path. &quot;Six degrees of separation&quot; has become a mantra for some.<br />John Bennett, a Certified Management Consultant, has put together an easy-to-read-and use-handbook of networking. There's a technique on each page. Simple, direct, not pages of wasted words. Most of the content seems like common sense, though as Voltaire told us, &quot;common sense is uncommon.&quot; There is no table of contents, no index, no appendices. Just page after page of things you ought to know, but might have forgotten. It's a good reminder for everyone involved in networking . . . and we all are.<br />On most pages, the author also provides us with a box entitled &quot;It works.&quot; These sidebars are quotes from a wide range of people who, in  short statement, validate the value of networking to them. There is no connection between the technique presented on each page and the quote printed on the same page. It's like reading two books at once, a bit disconcerting, but interesting as well. The quotes offer a glimpse into the thoughts of others and provide a list of some of John Bennett's networking contacts. Nice way to honor your friends, colleagues, and clients.<br />This book would be a good gift for that new graduate or for a protégé as you start a mentoring relationship.	2002-04-18

There are blanks to complete throughout the book, questions to answer about yourself, your life, and what you're doing about it. It's the kind of book that is actually a workbook that enables you to figure out for yourself how well you're doing in the areas of concern that the authors present.<br />There are thirteen chapters in the book, divided into two sections. The first section, A Look in the Mirror, enables the reader to look inwardly with chapter after chapter of self-evaluation. Initial chapters are How Well Do You Know Yourself, What Does It Take to Motivate You, and Evaluating Past Performance. These are followed by Your Ability to Communicate, Are You the Obstacle, Quality of Life = Thoughts, and Life is Like a Train. The language and flow seem much like the weekly radio show, &quot;Empowering People for Success&quot; that is hosted by the authors.<br />Section Two, The Professional You, explores Being Affected by Those Around You, Maximizing Your Contribution, Keeping Your Ideas Alive, Coloring Within the Lines, The Team Player within You, and Closing Thoughts. The book is seasoned with vignettes that illustrate the authors' points. <br />This is a good book for people who are searching for answers, looking at where to go with their lives. It's written in the first person-Nancy. Even though two authors' names appear on the cover, the author speaks in first person singular and refers to Jeff as a separate person. While this does not take away from the content, it can throw off a reader expecting to hear from a team of writers. <br />The book can be stimulating, but should not be taken as the whole answer or the only answer. Coloring Within the Lines, for example, may be good advice for some. However, others enthusiastically encourage people seeking to grow to color OUTSIDE the lines.  Different approaches. This book's approach will be helpful for people looking for a thought-provoking guide to move themselves ahead in life.	2002-04-07
US	52870090	R3ABUZ9F8DBVRW	1578514592	934977536	The War for Talent	Books	5	17	21	N	N	Read this book before your competitors do!	You can no longer be satisfied with &quot;C&quot; players in your organization. To compete in today's world, you need a powerful team of &quot;A&quot; players-top talent. Every savvy employer knows this fact, at least intuitively. Incredibly, relatively few act on this knowledge, satisfying themselves instead with &quot;warm bodies.&quot; And they wonder why they aren't more profitable. (Shake your head in disbelief here.)<br />Produced by three consultants from McKinsey &amp; Company, &quot;The War for Talent&quot; is based on five years of in-depth research on how companies manage leadership talent. [The research is explained in the book.] From what they learned from surveys of 13,000 executives at more than 120 leading companies and 27 case studies, the authors propose a talent-based approach to recruiting and holding management employees. The concept is simple: emphasize a deep conviction that competitive advantage comes from having better talent at all levels. Execution of that talent is more difficult, requiring total commitment and consistent action on the part of all leaders throughout the organization. <br />The authors have limited their focus to managerial talent, ignoring the tremendous contribution made by non-management employees. Their contention is that if you have highly talented managers, everything else will work just fine. I had a problem with that concept, feeling that it takes strong talent at all levels to achieve corporate success. As I read the book, I found myself mentally extending the authors' approaches and recommendations to all workers. <br />The book begins, aptly enough, with a chapter explaining the War for Talent. Wake-up call statements include recognition from 99% of the companies surveyed that their managerial talent pool needs to be much stronger in three years. At the same time, there is an understanding that the pool from which companies will recruit that talent will shrink. Therefore, competition for talent will become morelike a war. In the first of many interesting comparison boxes in the book, we learn that the old reality says people need companies and that jobs are scarce. The new reality is that companies need people and that talented people are scarce. These comparison boxes deliver valuable, thought-provoking insights throughout the book.<br />The authors explain that most companies are poor at talent management. This situation must change. Executives who read this book will be in a more advantageous position to do something about this problem-if they take action based on what they read. The book is filled with action stimulators. <br />The second chapter shows readers how to Embrace a Talent Mindset. It's a way of thinking that drives the whole process. In chapter three, we learn how to Craft a Winning Employee Value Proposition. This is an essential part of the book, emphasizing the relationship between the management employee and the company. It talks about what managers are looking for in a job-in an environment, and how to give it to them.  Included are culture, growth opportunities, compensation and much more. It's the total experience that makes a company so attractive to the kind of people it seeks.<br />With a clear idea now that your company is different, much more oriented toward giving talented managers what they need to achieve, chapter four explains how to Rebuild Your Recruiting Strategy. You'll shift from chasing all over trying to get people to work for you to becoming so attractive that talent gravitates to you. Recruiting becomes more targeted and takes place over a longer period of time. You're growing your future workforce by engaging with people even years before it's time for them to join you.<br />Chapter Five captures a trend which is growing in America, but not nearly as fast as it needs to: the personal development of high potential talent. The authors describe in page after page how coaching, mentoring, and bosses with high expectations can propel atalented person to greater heights and greater performance in much less time. Candid feedback enables people to stretch and grow in ways that hold them with the company so they can do more. We know how important growth is to talented people, so the ideas and illustrative stories in this chapter will be eye-opening for many readers.<br />In the next chapter, the authors present the concept of differentiating among employees. Workers are ranked as &quot;A,&quot;, &quot;B,&quot; or &quot;C&quot; players, in consideration of their performance and their potential. This chapter shows &quot;how to invest in the most capable people (A players), grow the solidly contributing middle (B players), and act decisively on the low performers (the C players), and put the spotlight on all three in a rigorous talent review process.&quot; D players-the clearly incompetent or unethical-are not discussed since they shouldn't even be there anyway. The plan is to Differentiate and Affirm Your People. When high performers are appreciated, they become even more productive. They develop a pride which drives them to greater heights . . . and pulls others along with them.<br />The final chapter, Get Started-and Expect Huge Impact in a Year, presents a process for implementing the authors' concepts in your organization. Of course, you won't see immediate results. However, if you're serious about the transformation, results will come. Expect huge impact in the first year, the authors encourage; set the bars high. It can happen. It must happen if your company is going to be a high achiever, a winner in the ongoing War for Talent.<br />Roger Herman, co-author of &quot;How to Become an Employer of Choice&quot;	2002-03-31

Or the business you'd like to start. Building a business is a daunting proposition, not for the weak of heart-or weak of wallet. The key is to discover something different that will grab attention. What's the old saw: Find a need and fill it?<br />Peter Meyer, principal of a California (where else) consulting firm that specializes in the subject of this book, suggests a different approach. Instead of competing with everyone else, create a new market. Makes sense. As Meyer points out, it's exciting, fun, and profitable. New markets are forgiving and, without rivals you don't have to worry about competitive pricing. Can it be this easy? Meyer lays it out in Chapter One: The Mystique and Challenges of New Markets. Prepare to have your mind opened, your thoughts stimulated, your imagination titillated. <br />The first part of this highly readable book (type size and leading enables this book to be easily read on trains and airplanes) addresses strategies. The second part with application of the strategies. Good model for this highly practical book. <br />The other chapters of the first section deliver ideas, perspective, and examples of how the strategies have been used. Balancing Your Resources and Opportunities. It's the Problem That Matters. Choosing the Best Risk. What New Markets are Available to You?  Are you beginning to get a sense of the depth of content of this book? <br />The book is written in relatively short sections, so the reader never seems overburdened by the volume of text. I kept slowing down...because I was thinking about what Meyer said. Then I found myself taking notes, like I was starting to write a business plan. See what I mean? I predict that you'll read this book at least twice: once for a quick overview, then at least one more time (with Peter Meyer at your elbow) thinking, talking to yourself (and others), and constructing ideas that may drive your future.<br />Charts sprinkledthroughout the book will guide in your understanding of the message. So will the questions tossed out by the author. There are many paths to take in creating, exploring, exploiting, and dominating new markets. Each alternative approach has its advantages and disadvantages. Your strength will come from understanding what's involved in your journey, and that power will come from this book.<br />Section Two concentrates on the application of the strategies. Funding the New Market Effort. What Role Does the Customer Play? Building and Dominating Markets Through Involvement. What is the Role of Information Technology. Using Credibility in Creating and Dominating Markets. What's Next? And the book closes with a good index to help you find what you want on your second and third readings.<br />This is the new frontier. You can be on the leading edge. It's a different world, as Meyer warns. If you think you're up for it-and the book will help you determine that readiness, this book will be your guide. <br />Now my review is done. I'm going back for my second helping!	2002-03-24

The book was written by two professors who met, and discovered a synergy for writing, while they were students at Harvard. They've developed a style that presents their points in a well-organized fashion, with sufficient illustration and documentation to validate the authors' points. The examples they use are well-known companies that have achieved global dominance; now we know how they did it-with plenty of information and understanding between two covers of a modern book.<br />The book is organized into nine chapters, each strong enough to be a stand-alone publication on its own. We start with Rising Up to the Global Challenge and then move into Building Global Presence. Appetites whetted, we now get a comprehensive case study: Lessons from Wal-Mart's Globalization. Exploiting Global Presence comes next, followed by a chapter on Cultivating a Global Mindset. This is primary theme of the book; it's a mindset that enables dominance.<br />Chapter 6 gets into some how-to: Building a Global Knowledge Machine, sharing vital information and understanding across national boundaries and cultural divides. The authors then concentrate on the Dynamics of Global Business Teams and Changing the Rules of the Global Game. The final chapter is Globalization in the Digital Age, keeping us right up-to-date and reminding the reader that this topic is real and &quot;present&quot; in today's organizations. A bibliography and two indices follow the footnotes section. <br />The ordinary lay reader will have trouble with this book. It is an academic work. However, for senior executives, marketing professionals, and students of globalization, this book will be a treasure. Those involved with graduate education in business should not miss this book. It will be valuable reading for self-growing executives engaged in executive MBA programs, giving them solid knowledge and insight to apply in their real world of global growth and dominance.	2002-02-03

Beep!: Competing in the Age of the Road Runner	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Thought-Provoking Visit to the Funny and Familiar	The Road Runner cartoons are classic. Most of us grew up laughing out loud as Wile E. Coyote encountered one challenge after another in his attempts to capture the Road Runner. The scenarios were simple. The coyote devised ways to capture lunch, never winning the competition. His tools, all products of Acme Company, backfired on him. He caused himself a great deal of difficulty, while the Road Runner went on with his life, practically oblivious to the coyote's campaign. <br />At the start of their book, Bell and Harari note that coyotes can run 30 miles per hour and road runners can't really fly and can only run 16 miles per hour. Wile E. Coyote has an endless arsenal of gadgets to trap the road runner, all provided by his single supplier, Acme. He's a master planner, yet continually fails . . . of his own volition. What's the problem here? Why is the Road Runner so successful? Because he's operating under different rules. The coyote may be seen as chained to conventional wisdom, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. A bureaucrat. The Road Runner is more like the agile entrepreneur, competing with a whole different paradigm.<br />The authors take this familiar cartoon and turn it into an instructive business case. Their objective is to help us become road runners among coyotes. In page after page, they pull lessons from the cartoons that we probably all missed as kids, comparing the characters and their motivations and their results. \\"Wile E. Coyote is preoccupied, earnest, conniving, and grim. The Road Runner is joyful, light, and free. Wile E. does nothing but go from pursuing one meal to the next, with perpetual frustration; the bird is gleefully living life to the fullest. The results are the same: Wile E. somehow manages to dig himself into the hole of failure, while the Road Runner strides on, undeterred and unaffected by life's bumps and obstacles.\\"  <br />Can you imagine the authors conducting their research for this book?<br />As we move through the book, we learn more about the comparative principles and how to succeed in the Age of the Road Runner. Familiar names populate the pages as we are provided with examples of companies and people. A \\"Tail Feathers\\" feature spotlights ordinary people doing extraordinary things-as Road Runners. The stories are inspirational, as well as educational. \\"Bird Seed\\" sections furnish the reader with solid advice that fits the concept, but it not linked to the two main characters.<br />Descriptive summaries of Road Runner cartoon incidents are liberally sprinkled throughout the book, keeping the reader laughing and smiling and wondering in amazement how the coyote could keep going in this futile struggle. And therein lies the tale of this book. To survive in a Road Runner Age, you cannot continue to operate like a coyote. The book is filled with current wisdom, but just as important, it's a fun book to read. People learn more when they're laughing, so expect to gain a lot from Beep! Beep!	2002-02-03

Most turn out to be biographical anthologies. True Leaders is different. <br />This tightly written (read: no fluff to bulk-up the book's size) book is organized around a set of values, which the authors found to be central to corporate success. With a focus on core values, leaders operate differently than those who are focused on what the bottom line will look like at the end of the next reporting period. Their results are stronger and more sustainable in the long run. Satisfaction levels-for them and for the people working for them-are much higher. Trust runs deep. True leadership is at work.<br />The authors interviewed 25 CEOs from both private and public sector organizations. They confirmed that ten core values are the essence of their work: Passion is a prerequisite. See what is not yet visible. Care enough to connect and convey. Treat learning like dirty dishes. Do what's right and tell the truth. Trust is a must. Recognize and build people. Trust your intuition. Risk to respond and grow. Respect the importance of balance. And those core values are the chapters of the book.<br />In each of the chapters, the authors explain the value and its importance, illustrating and reinforcing the concepts through stories from the CEOs. These perspectives are woven into the fabric of each chapter in a way that is very comfortable for the reader. The input from the CEOs brings the values to life, inspiring as well as educating the reader. The presentations are never \\"in-your-face,\\" but fit nicely into the pattern of the reader's experience with the book. <br />Just about the time you'll feel like you've completed the book and are ready to close the cover with a silent \\"thanks\\" to the authors, you'll discover there's more. Over thirty more pages are organized into appendices talking about Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE), a leadership evaluation, a one-on-one discussion card, an attitudes and values graph, and profiles of the companies represented by the CEOs used in the book. And, of course, there's an index. Nice package. <br />You might want to get two copies of this book, one to keep on the shelf, and one to loan to friends. <BR>shelf, and one to loan to friends.	2002-02-02

It was recommended by a friend when I expressed intrigue with books that mixed illustrations and stories to communicate management messages (a la Who Moved My Cheese).<br />The author is a PhD-level, highly experienced consultant . . . with a couple of cats. From her biography in the book, I'd expect something strong. I'd describe the book more as &quot;cute&quot; or &quot;artsy,&quot; rather than having strong content. <br />Hessler-Key suggests that we can learn from cats, applying their behaviors to better manage our own. Her thirteen messages are couched in short descriptive pieces from or about her cat. The advice is succinct at the end of each of the one-page lessons. Here are the messages: Pick a business or career that lets you express your talents. Done only that and do it well. Constantly look for ways to full your customers needs. Gauge your distance, position yourself, and leap. Follow your instincts. Clean out the old and begin again. Observe your environment closely and with detachment. Meander and Explore. Catnap occasionally-dream. Walk away from opportunities that don't meet your standards. Be independent, but don't isolate yourself. Pick your priority; be relentless. Life Balance. Find your place in the sun, relax and enjoy life. <br />A 14-page workbook section follows, asking a number of questions around each of the thirteen themes. This feature could make the book a worthwhile tool for workshops, though my personal concern is that there is not enough meat and seriousness in the book's content to inspire effective responses without the author or a colleague serving as a facilitator. <br />I'm not sure that today's reader is in the same space that this book occupies. It seems to fluffy and light to be taken seriously, even though the messages are valid. It's not up to what I'd like to see from this author and not what I'm accustomed to seeing from Berrett-Kohler.	2002-01-31

That's Hoover's Vision, from start to finish. This is the unusual book that you'll read carefully from cover to cover, then want to read again and use as a reference book. This is a book to treasure.<br />Why do I characterize Hoover's Vision this way? Let's begin with the author. Gary Hoover is an entrepreneur, a highly successful visionary entrepreneur. He's the sort of person that you listen to especially carefully if you meet him at a cocktail party. He started reading FORTUNE magazine when he was 12 and moved into a career with Citibank (securities analyst), May Department Stores (Manager of Strategic Planning), and then his first entrepreneurial venture. He created BOOKSTOP, an innovative large-space retail operation that he sold to Barnes & Noble for $40 million after just seven years. His work was the foundation of the now familiar book superstores. Then he went on to found Hoover's, Inc, the company behind Hoover's OnLine, a premier source for information about corporations. <br />Now, the book. Start with the introduction: The Art of Enterprise: Thinking Differently. Hoover explains that he has been on a mission to discover the reasons for success of enterprises of all kinds, what separates winners from losers. This book presents the findings of his 38 years of research. He suggests that the book is meant for people who own their own business or dream of creating one, for executives or leaders of departments or divisions of large organizations, for people charged with thinking strategically or who serve on boards of for-profit or not-for-profit enterprises, for those looking for enterprises to invest time or money in, and for those passionately devoted to goals achieve through the combined efforts of a group of people. A nugget I gleaned from this section was \\"Great businesses succeed because of their leaders' ability to see things thatothers do not see. To ask questions that others do not ask. And then to chart their own course, combining insights and strategies into the blueprint for a uniquely focused enterprise.\\"<BR>Hoover postulates that the secrets of success are 1. observing and understanding other people and how their needs, desires, interest, values and tastes change over time; 2. serving other people by making their lives better; and 3. developing a business style that expresses your own dreams and passions even as it serves the needs of others. He stresses the importance of learning new ways of thinking. Readers are now set-up to honor curiosity . . . right where Hoover wants us to be.<br />The first section of the book, Exploration, is organized into three sections: Curiosity: The Foundation of Creativity, History: The Study of Change Through Time, and Geography: The Study of the World Around Us. While I'm tempted to share some of the wealth of Hoover's nuggets of wisdom, I will restrain myself so you can enjoy this book unspoiled. Chapter after chapter will stimulate your thinking. Each chapter closes with \\"TryThis,\\" a recommended exercise to extend and enrich the work done in each chapter. In his \\"Gateways\\" section at the end of chapters, Hoover recommends topic-related supplemental readings. As I read this book, I found my head bobbing up and down, then my pace slowing to look deeper and ponder a thought Hoover expressed. In chapter after chapter, Hoover covers things to watch and learn from. Each chapter is thought-provoking, which is the author's purpose.<br />Part 2, entitled Essence: The Power of Vision, explores vision from a number of directions. Here Hoover emphasizes clear and consistent visions, unique visions, the value of the customer and more. He demonstrates how vision makes a powerful difference in how the organization is driven and how successful it may become. When you can see your vision, you can go anywhere. Without a clear vision, you may go nowhere.<br />Part 3 focuses on Execution: Enterprises at Work. Hoover looks at various industries and enterprises, evaluating merger mania. customer focus, and the critical need of having the Right Stuff. Some appendices and a good table of contents round out the value of this provocative book. <br />Expect to move a bit slower than your normal reading pace. You'll gain a lot as you mull over ideas, consider alternatives, and feel your mind extending beyond your normal thought range.	2002-01-28

No, I've never met the man. But, I feel like we've had a personal conversation and I can call him friend. That's the way this book reads. Now I'm motivated to read his previous books: \\"Love and Profit,\\" \\"Life and Work,\\" and others. <br />As a consulting futurist, I advise my client organization's leadership teams how to prepare for their future. The emphasis of my work is workforce and workplace issues. Looking at the design and performance of the corporation of the future, I'm confident that we'll see a significantly different style of leadership than we see in today's organizations. I teach-and-preach this shift in my consultations, seminars, and speeches to management groups. The emerging style is much more employee centered, less authoritarian. Some have called this emerging model \\"servant leadership,\\" so I was eager to read Autry's book to learn about his perspective.<br />Though a consultant and speaker himself, Autry's \\"been there, done that.\\" He's practiced the principles he espouses in a number of settings, including in his former role as president of the Meredith Corporation's publishing group. This experience enables him to present real-life examples from his personal leadership career, moving this book from an academic treatise to almost a personal story of \\"here's how I did it . . . and  got great results.\\" Readers of this book will enjoy a feeling of sitting in a comfortable setting having a conversation with this thought leader.<br />The book is organized into four parts. The first part, A Foundation of Character and Vision, presents two baseline chapters: Characteristics of the Leader as a Servant, and Understanding the Three Aspects of Vision. This portion of the book alone produced sufficient value for me that I knew I wanted to give this volume high marks. Managers and leaders may find themselves looking more introspectively at their own styles, values, and expectations as they read these pages. Sure started me thinking.<br />Part Two of the book gets into some nitty-gritty. Application of the servant leader approach. How to build a community of people who enjoy working productively together to achieve shared desired results. Listen to the chapter titles: Finding the Right People. Training the Servant Leader. Tools of the Trade. Coping with the High-Tech Workplace.<BR>There were a couple of places in this portion of the book where my mind began to wander, but I was quickly drawn back to the text as I gained insight into how the principles of servant leadership work hand-in-hand with the more mundane aspects of management like job descriptions and performance appraisals. I turned down a lot of page corners.<br />The book's third section is entitled The Harsh Realities of Organizational Life. In three chapters, Organizational Issues, Personal Issues, and Legal Issues, Autry tackles everything from Firing People to Sexual Harassment. In the fourth part of the book, Autry gets into what he calls Finding the Balance. Hard work doesn't mean nose to the grindstone 18 hours a day. A servant leader builds loyalty (Servant Leadership and the Crisis of Loyalty), and helps resolve counterproductive problems in the workplace (Conflict). The other two chapters in this section address The Responsibilities of Family and Community Life and Leadership When Things Go Wrong and Times Are Bad. Good stuff for today's world!<br />The book closes with an interesting approach to an epilogue, Script for a Future Slide Show. In 24 snapshots of workplace situations in 2015, Autry gives us his glimpse of what life will be in the future with servant leadership. I doubt that we'll have to wait until 2015, agree that we'll see what he forecasts. I believe we'll see this leadership design in successful companies long before then, and it's application will engender positive differences in workforce stability, productivity, profitability, and the happiness of both leaders and led.<br />The book includes a workable index, but I would have liked to see a more comprehensive table of contents. With that aid, readers coming into this book would have a greater sense of the value they will receive. I'd encourage you to read this book, with a mind that is not only open from curiosity, but one that is open to make some changes in the way you lead.<BR>Special note to aspiring future leaders: don't miss this one! And do some more reading on the topic as more books come out on servant leadership in the years ahead.	2002-01-23

We've each had those experiences where we'd like to just grab some executive by the shirt collar and scream, &quot;Do you have any idea what you're doing? Don't you want me to be your customer??&quot;<br />Hal Becker has been down that same road of lousy service, but he's said something about it. &quot;Lip Service&quot; is a monument to lousy customer service, written by a man who has enjoyed a career as an award-winning salesman, sales trainer, business owner, and professional speaker. What a bully platform! And Becker uses it.<br />I'd like to say Becker pulls no punches in this book, but that's not quite true. Many of his examples make it obvious, without identifying the company, who he's talking about. Other references are more obscure. As an angry customer myself, on too many occasions, I'd like to be much more aggressive in naming names, dates, and specifics. I can just imagine this author sitting in a law library in his attorney's office while his legal advisors read the original manuscript. &quot;No, you can't say that. You're asking for a heavy lawsuit&quot; &quot;That's bordering on libel; I can't let you say that.&quot; And Becker's protesting against his attorney's protective advice.  &quot;But, I wanna . . . .&quot;  The &quot;Don't&quot; prevailed, but quite a bit of really juicy stuff still crept in.<br />Becker's consultant hat is on in this book. He tells the story (while the reader cheers), then provides a response of what should have been done. Again the reader will shout &quot;Right on!&quot;  So, it's a fun read from this perspective, like enjoying one of those hard-hitting investigative television news shows.<br />But this book has even more value as a customer service textbook. Everyone in a role of serving customers, especially in those high-contact retail environments, should read this book. Customer service is more than lip service, and Lip Service makes that clear.<br />You'll geta kick out of the writing style in this book. In the fifty humorous stories, Becker sounds like a combination of an impatient New Yorker, Seinfeld, and Mr. Everyman. The book closes with strong, instructive interviews with ten (profitable, naturally) companies that do customer service the right way.<br />Hal Becker is speaking for us. Have fun with this book, then give it to your favorite customer service specialist who needs some serious help.	2002-01-06

He's a professional in this work, rather than a political hack who appears when it's convenient for him. We've heard Weinberger's name for decades, as he served in cabinet positions for three United States presidents. Most notable was his seven years as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense. There is no question that he's had a significant impact on history.<br />This is the sort of autobiography that might be interesting, I thought, as I opened the cover and began reading. My first reaction was &quot;uh oh. We're going 'way back into his childhood. That concern was quickly dissolved as I was absorbed in the feeling that Weinberger and I were settled down into a couple of comfortable easy chairs discussing his experiences as a consummate public servant. I learned about his education (Harvard), his military service (infantry, World War II, including time on MacArthur's intelligence staff), and service as a California legislator. This book easily held my attention, page after page. Most of the twentieth century came alive before my eyes.<br />As he moves through history, Weinberger tells about his pivotal roles with fascinating detail. The reader gains an inside perspective of what was behind historical events that are very familiar to us, and some that are not so familiar. Using the autobiographer's license, Weinberger shares his opinions about people and events. A number of times, I had a sense that I was right there in the room with him as history was being made. He gives just enough detail to paint illuminating pictures of facts, emotions, decisions, and the flow of history; yet the book never drags with a sense that he's using space unproductively. <br />I enjoyed reading about his views on the Cold War, Saddam Hussein, Iran-Contra, the day Reagan was shot, Watergate, MacArthur, Colin Powell, Bill Clinton's legacy, and Nixon's resignation. As I finished the book, I had a feeling of satisfaction, respect, and appreciation for Caspar Weinberger and his life. A warm feeling, a good feeling. I like getting that from a good book. You will, too.	2002-01-06

Persuasion is done every day in business environments, in the home, in shopping experiences, and many other encounters between people. We're not talking about negotiation; we're talking about persuasion. Certainly, they're closely related, but as different as two siblings. <br />As a Certified Management Consultant and Futurist, part of my work is helping corporate leaders-present and future-prepare for what tomorrow's corporation will be. I suggest to you that today's coercion, directiveness, and team leadership will be supplanted by a new style of getting things done: persuasion. With a complicated web of independent contractors, contingent laborers, matrixed employees, and strategic partners, no one will be able to tell who is really in control. Therefore, the &quot;control&quot; will go to the people who are most persuasive.  This book, and others like it, will become the textbooks for future success. And, of course, they'll sure help in today's world, too.<br />Roger Dawson is an internationally recognized expert in persuasion, negotiation, and helping people get what they want in life. There's a reason his books have been translated into ten languages and his audio program on negotiation is ranked as the largest-selling album in the history of business cassette publishing. This is a man to be listened to, to be read. His effectiveness is illustrated by examples from his own life.<br />The book's 27 chapters are organized into four sections: How to Play the Persuasion Game, Analyzing the Persuadee, How to Become a Power Persuader, and Learning Persuasion Techniques. The process begins with the aptly-titled introduction: &quot;What This Book Can Do for You.&quot; Do you feel like the persuasion is starting already? Hang on!<br />Listen to some of the chapter headings to get a sense of what's in this book: Eight Magic Keys that Control People,How to Make Them Want to Die for You, How Scarcity Drives People Wild, The Power of Association: Tying Your Persuasion to Something Good, Bonding: The Magic Key to Persuasion, What Motivates the Other Person, You'll Never Forget Another Name, and Eight Ways to Persuade the Angry Person. Whew! This book really covers the subject, with practical, no-holds-barred advice. Even if you just read the Key Points to Remember at the end of each chapter, you'd get your money's worth.<br />Strengthen your position for today and tomorrow. Grab your highlighter and a pad to take notes. Absorb this book. Apply its teachings. Watch your life change.	2002-01-06

The work from the corporate sector has not been consistent, appreciated, or encouraged. Through this book, the author hopes to stimulate more organizations to be actively supportive of the environment-and good business practices. A Certified Management Consultant with significant personal engagement with corporate environmental issues, Pamela Gordon profiles the work of twenty employers to show what can be done.<br />Many authors gather profiling information for books like this by researching on the internet, magazine articles, other books, and industry reports. To her credit, Gordon personally visited 16 of the companies cited, with the other four being visited by people from her firm. This direct involvement adds a higher degree of authenticity to her work and this book.<br />Lean and Green is organized into three sections. Part One presents four steps for creating a lean and green organization: Question Wasteful Practices, Gain Lean and Green Endorsement Using Business Language, Collaborate to Achieve Lean and Green Goals, and Track Progress for Environment and Profit. Interwoven through these introductory chapters are stories about how the 20 profiled employers have applied these approaches. The organizations are mostly large, well-known companies, and a city government,  but the principles can be applied in smaller organizations, as well.<br />The second section of the book presents Real-Life Examples of Putting Lean and Green into Practice. Ten chapters lay out the how-to of building a higher consciousness and effectiveness of environmental practices. Again, Gordon uses examples and experiences of her profiled companies and their people to illustrate and emphasize her points.<br />The third part of the book, How to Make the Most Difference, is best reported to you by listing the powerful chapter headings: How toBecome an Environmental Leader in Your Organization, Work with Your Organizational Culture to Support Change, Be an Environmental Activist Using Tactics That Benefit Business, and The Fastest Route to Lean and Green. Quotes are used to open each chapter, as many authors do. To focus even more strongly on the dedication and focus of her profiled corporate activists, Gordon quotes people from the companies rather than outside sources. Each chapter ends with a valuable summary of the chapter, entitled &quot;Making it Easy.&quot;<br />This book will smooth the way for its intended audiences: employees, managers, top leaders, and observers of organization that have great potential to make a difference. As I read the book, I found myself already becoming more aware of opportunities in my own surroundings to make a difference. If you're interested in protecting the environment and your company's bottom line, this book will open your eyes and give you tools for success.	2001-12-29

We don't hear as much about the topic today as we used to. Nevertheless, the need is still present . . . perhaps even more than ever before. With so many people today focused on their computers, some have forgotten about the fine art of balanced personal growth.<br />Brian Tracy is a master in the field of personal and professional development. His speeches, seminars, and consulting around the globe have contributed to Tracy's reputation. He is highly respected and quite influential, particularly among the thousands who attend his presentations each year. As Tracy lived his life, then taught others his system, his approach was continually refined. In Focal Point, it all comes together for anyone who reads the book.<br />Focal Point explains how users of this tool (you'll do more than just read the words in this book to get its powerful total value) can unlock their full potential. At the same time, using the system will enable you to double your productivity and simplify your life. Of course, this sounds like the makings of a fine motivational speech; Tracy is a motivator. But, this book invests most of its pages in the how-to.<br />The chapters are filled with the knowledge of the sages in this field. Many teachings will sound familiar-good! In Focal Point, all that advice is pulled together into one place, one system to learn and apply. A listing of the chapter headings will reveal what you will explore in these pages: Tap Your Most Precious Resource, Practice Personal Strategic Planning, Supercharge Your Business and Career, Improve Your Family and Personal Life, Achieve Financial Independence, Enjoy Superb Health and Fitness, Become Everything You Are Capable of Becoming, Make a Difference in Your Community, and Spiritual Development and Inner Peace. Note that these are how-to chapters, filled with things like &quot;Six Steps to Doubling Your Income and Doubling Your TimeOff&quot; and &quot;Seven Keys to Higher Productivity.&quot; Each chapter includes challenging questions to help you see where you still have some work to do.<br />Tracy's Focal Point process consists of seven steps to be applied in each area of concern:<BR>values, vision, goals, knowledge and skills, habits, daily activities, and actions. The whole valuable system is explained so you can use the book as a tool to make a substantial difference in yourself, your success, and your personal satisfaction. The book concludes with a chapter on Seven Lessons for the Twenty-First Century, a List of Values, a Recommended Reading list, and an index.<br />If you want to strengthen your life, your effectiveness, and your happiness, you'll discover a great friend in Focal Point. And you'll probably recommend it to your friends. It's just that kind of a book: it bothers you, makes you uncomfortable, but shows you how to make the improvements you want to need and desire.

First of all, I must confess to you that I normally do not read military history or battlefield stories. A book about one of the most life-changing historical events on a 122-square mile island nation in the Mediterranean Sea may be important to people on Malta, but not me. Except that I went to Malta for a vacation and was given a copy of the book by another traveler who had just finished it. &quot;Good book,&quot; he proclaimed, so I started reading.<br />I couldn't put the book down. I hungrily read chapter after chapter. The tale of how the Knights of St. John defended this strategically important island from the onslaught of a Turkish force was fascinating. The Turks in the 1500s were a powerful nation whose dominance spread far and wide. The Knights of St. John held the island of Malta, strategically positioned to enable the Sultan to conquer Europe. Interstingly, the clash also pitted Moslems against Christians in a struggle that even has relevance to current events.<br />A huge force of 200 ships and 40,000 men attempted to overthrow the Knights of St. John whose force numbered about 9,600. The naval and ground battles, the heroism, the strategy, and all the stories leap off the pages. The author brings this centuries-old historical event to life, based on historical research that presents facts and figures which support the story he tells. This is a masterpiece. <br />Yes, it should be a movie--to rival Ben Hur and a few other box office hits. It is said that to be successful, every movie must have strong characters, violence, and sex. No sex in these pages, but the strong characters and their heroic feats will hold your attention from cover to cover.<br />Suggestion: go to a web site where you can view a map of Malta to understand the relative position of the locations described so vividly.	2001-12-27

Sometimes this competition becomes a frenzy, since the best people-qualified, experienced-are in high demand. It's essential, to compete well, to become an Employer of Choice. Ahlrichs, in her preface, observes that employers of choice &quot;know that their 'choice' status is a significant achievement attained through consistent application of comprehensive strategies and tactics, as well as top-bottom organizational responsibility for retention.<br />This book is divided into three important sections: the big picture, recruiting, and retention.  In Part One, How Employers of Choice are Winning the Talent Wars, the three chapters focus on Learning from Employers of Choice, Employer of Choice Foundation Strategies, and Building and Communicating a Top Employer Reputation. These writings present a good overview and insight into how Employers of Choice are operating. The orientation is to understand what these companies are doing, rather than a how-to approach. There is a lot to learn here.<br />The second part, Creative Strategies for Recruiting Top Talent, offers the readers four chapters, starting with How Employers of Choice are Redesigning Recruitment. The next chapter, Only You Will Do, has a little more instructional tone, but still primarily takes a third person view. This chapter concludes with a helpful Orientation Checklist. Chapter 6, Surfing for Recruiting Results Online does provide a healthy amount of how-to. While this field is changing almost daily, there is a lot of value here for the reader. Plenty of website domains are included. The last chapter in this section, Finding New Hires in Unlikely Places, is filled with good ideas. Here I felt a lot more of the how-to I was looking for.<br />The third section is entitled Comprehensive Strategies for Retaining Top Performers. Here the chapters are titled Understanding Why Employees Leave;Managing and Leading for Retention; Retrain, Develop, and Profit; and New Compensation and Benefits Strategies. There is a lot of value in these chapters-lots of ideas and perspectives. An exit interview guide will be helpful to those companies that have not taken advantage of this tool. The author seems to really hit her stride in providing ideas for readers in this section. The same holds for her conclusion, Becoming an Employer of Choice. <br />The book is well-written, filled with valuable information for the reader. The solid chapters are supplemented with a good resource guide and an index. I'd recommend this book for company owners, senior executives, and human resource professionals. As an ethical reviewer, I must share with you that I am co-author of &quot;How to Become an Employer of Choice,&quot; a competing title in the same field. With that perspective, I would be quite comfortable recommending my clients read &quot;Competing for Talent&quot; as a supplement to my book.	2001-12-20

Part 2 tells how to make changes to create a balanced life. Part Three \\"describes particular situations that are common but may not apply to everyone.\\" The fourth part \\"talks about activities that will help you increase the balance in your life this year and in the years to come.\\"<br />That's what this book does. It talks. At a very basic level. Opening a book written by a woman who is executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Charles Schwab, I expected more. What I found was a combination of low-level training material that would come from a beginning seminar leader and group therapy. <br />Each chapter starts with a parable. Anyone with a couple of years of experience as a trainer or speaker-or active participant in seminars or conventions-would have heard them several times. Nothing new, unless you just haven't had the exposure to this sort of presentation. The book is filled with quotes-I counted over 100-that appear on page after page. It seemed like the author's research consisted of heavy use of \\"Bartlett's Quotations.\\" For people who like quotes to stick on the refrigerator door or on a bulletin board next to their desk, this book is a treasure.<br />To present the various issues she deals with, the author uses unattributed quotes from people who suffer from imbalance in their lives. Each is printed in italics to differentiate their contributions from the author's writing. Sometimes that's very helpful, or else it would be difficult to tell the difference. Reading through these pages, with all these \\"people\\" sharing their tales, I felt like I was in a group therapy session. <br />If you'd like to experience a therapeutic sort of conversation that explores a lot of the issuesaround achieving life balance, and you like quotes and fables, read this book.

Whether you're a human resources professional or an executive or manager in a company without a human resources department, you are confronted by all sorts of difficult personnel questions. Hiring and firing can be highly complicated subjects. Scary. Unless you have someone you can turn to for reliable advice. <br />Never fear. Paul Falcone is here! The author of &quot;96 Great Interview Questions to Ask Before You Hire&quot; and &quot;101 Sample Write-Ups for Documenting Employee Performance Problems&quot; has authored a book that will relieve the stress in your people-management life. Falcone is Director of Employment and Development Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and teaches for UCLA. Here's a resource who knows what he's talking about.<br />This book is organized into two main sections: Hiring and Firing. Under the Hiring Section, you'll find chapters on the hiring process, recruitment tools, online recruiting, interviewing, and making the final selection. The Firing Section begins with a chapter answering common questions about the performance management and termination process. Next, the reader will learn about progressive discipline, terminations for cause and summary offenses, and reductions-in-force and layoffs.<br />Through these chapters, Falcone presents 112 vital questions . . . and answers. Each question is addressed with a basic answer, followed by a section titled &quot;Tell Me More.&quot; What a wealth of information! <br />And, as if this weren't enough, the book also includes an appendix with sample policies, agreements, and letters. The comprehensiveness of this section is amazing. A glossary, resource list, and index provide even more value.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-12-17

Layoffs abound. Hiring is down or frozen at most companies. Employers who recruited on college campuses have cancelled the offers made to graduating students. Employers have hunkered down for a tight period that may last a few months or, as some pessimists forecast, for years.<br />While campus recruiting is down dramatically, wise employers will still visit top colleges and universities looking for the best and the brightest. If they're just going to hire a few people, it makes sense to go for the cream of the crop. The question becomes just how to do this kind of specialized recruiting in an employment market that was highly competitive, then became quiet, but that will pick up again. Hiring top MBAs-and other highly desirable candidates-is now a strategic issue. To maintain a competitive advantage now and later when the pace picks up again, it's essential to gain the knowledge and insight that fosters high performance and stunning results. There hasn't been much written about this specialized field. Now there's a book that will teach you how. Whether you're a neophyte at this kind of recruiting or an old hand, you will learn from Taguchi.<br />Some things change; some remain the same. Taguchi presents a wide range of accepted protocols that have not-and will not-change. All of these elements are important for recruiters to fully understand if they are to gain the needed cooperation and support of the career professionals at their targeted schools. One thing that is changing is that &quot;compensation may have won out in the past, but nowadays it takes a whole lot more to attract and keep top talent.&quot; This is a job that must be done well, since so much is riding on your success. <br />Reading this book, I learned that there are four phases to MBA recruiting: up-front preparation, pre-recruitment, interviews, and second rounds and offers. Cutting corners won't work; each of these phases must be handled carefully. Each of these phases is explained for the reader in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 7. Chapter 6? Page after page of lessons learned by 15 experienced recruiters, a treasure in itself. This author has done her homework. The chapter on Best Practices and Worst Mistakes brings out more lessons to learn from. <br />Chapter 10 is by far the largest: School Profiles of the Top Twenty Picks. For each school, the book presents an overview of the MBA program and what degrees are granted. On campus recruiting at that institution is explained, with advice, followed by a school-specific list of dos and don'ts. Other recruiting options and key go-to people are included. While this is incredibly valuable information that will save recruiters a considerable amount of time, the personal resources could become outdated quickly. Hint: use this information now!<br />Other helpful chapters cover advice for established companies and for start-ups. The chapter on recruiting on the fly may be particularly valuable if you simply don't have time to plan and design an elaborate recruiting program. If the economy heats up quickly or you have a fast-growing company with immediate needs, this chapter will be a vital resource. Web recruiting is explored in chapter 14, followed by a couple of chapters on retention. There is no question that developing and keeping the MBAs you hire is critical, but the title of the book is specifically hiring. It's nice to have the obligatory retention chapters, but the book is strong without them. The three appendices provide some metrics and additional resources.<br />Bonus insight: Sherrie Taguchi's experience glows in this book. She gained experience as Vice President of University Relations for Bank of America and Director of Corporate Human Resources for Dole Packaged Foods. Now she's on the other side of the desk as Director of MBA Career Management and Management Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business. Her conversational writing style gives the reader the feeling of sitting in a big, comfy chair in front of a warming fire, chatting away about how specialized college recruiting really works . . . the inside story.	2001-12-17

The second chapter, keeping with the times, teaches the reader how to prepare scannable resumes. Yes, Virginia, many corporations scan resumes into computers and use Optical Character Recognition software to sort of automate resumes into a searchable database. Chapter three explains how to submit an electronic resume. Users of this book will certainly be up-to-date!<br />The second section of the book deals with cover letters. This list of chapter headings will give you some insight into the treasures here: Writing Effective Cover Letters, Putting Your Job Search Letters to Work, Using Electronic Letters, Responding to Advertisements, Sending Unsolicited Letters, Getting a Little Help from a Friend-Networking and Referral Letters, Writing Gracious Thank You Letters, Using Follow-Up Letters to Get Results, Accepting or Declining the Job Offer, and helpfully, Writing Letters of Resignation.

Prepare to take copious notes; you won't want to write in this book.<br />If you look in a bricks-and-mortar bookstore for this book, you may have some difficulty. The publisher has categorized the book as &quot;Home Decoration/Interior Design.&quot; OK, I acquiesce. It is a beautiful book on decorating and design, and it is related to the home. But this is a business book, make no mistake about it. The volume does, however, demonstrate that it is possible to have an efficient workspace that also looks really good.<BR>And that bothered me about Home Office Life. Everything is so neat and pretty in those pictures. I'm not sure our home office looked that good on the first day of operations! I suppose you have to make everything look pretty and sterile for such photos, though.<br />Lisa Kanarek covers the waterfront for us. The first chapter deals with How to Make a Better Business at Home. Some of us really need this! Included are planning, set-up, and organization. You'll learn things about how to carve out a space for yourself and how to design the office that will work for you. And you'll get lots of tips along the way.<br />The second section of the book talks about Getting Down to Business. You'll learn how to put your home office to work, setting up shop and getting settled in. The third section deals with reality, presenting real examples of how home offices can work. This section has the information needed by people considering a makeover of their home office. A resource list and an index make this book even more valuable.<br />With the movement toward home offices, this book is a winner. You might suggest your architect buy one, too. If you use an interior decorator, get yet another copy.	2001-12-10

US	52870090	R96AILXP27LDS	0883910217	332682504	The Leader Within You	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Autobiographical, biographical, inspirational, instructive	Bob Danzig was the senior corporate executive in charge of the Hearst Newspaper Group for two decades. During that time-and through his career leading up to that point, he met movers and shakers and a lot of &quot;ordinary&quot; people who made a difference in one way or another. In this book, he's tried to capture a wide range of experiences and perspectives-almost too much-to make his points about leadership.<br />The autobiographical thread starts at the beginning of the book and continues all the way through. If you're interested in selected aspects of the life of a highly involved newspaper man, this book will provide you with one historical anecdote after another. Danzig shares many of his experiences with people of significance and, well, other people of a different kind of significance. His professional life story weaves through the book-in disjointed pieces. I found myself wanting a stronger stream of consciousness, a more connected flow of this man's life. He is obviously a key player kind of person, but the reader never gets a full story of Danzig, the man. <br />To present and illustrate his nine powers of leadership, Danzig shares the stories of men and women who exemplify the powers he enumerates. He provides evidence for his points, describing how each role model lived the power he describes. Then a third person's comments are inserted to validate Danzig's points by lauding the celebrity. Some of these role models are well-known. Others are not as familiar to us, if known at all. As one example follows another in a well-designed flow, they help Danzig make his powerful points about the role of leadership.<br />Readers will learn about 9 Powers: Quality, Innovation, Inspiration, Perseverance, Passion, Character, Charisma, Energy and Enthusiasm. The instructional thread can be followed, interwoven with the autobiographical and biographical threads. While sharing some of the experiences of an important newspaper man, you'll gain from the knowledge and perspective he learned from the people he met and quoted in this book.<br />For a thought-provoking and inspirational read, pick up a copy of The Leader within You. You'll learn a lot about leadership, the leader with in you, and what you can achieve with the resources you have.	2001-12-02

He is currently a professor and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. He has served on the faculties of Cambridge, Yale, University of Manchester, University of Chicago, University of Michigan, and McGill University.<br />This background should tell you something already about the author's perspective and what this book will be like. &quot;Money in an Unequal World&quot; is a deep academic treatment of the role of money in society. For those engaged in the study of this topic, this book offers a revolutionary way of rethinking money and society. Hart addresses how internet access separates societies by controlling their access to money and commerce. He shows how money that transfers outside national controls-and taxes-gives some the distinct advantage of being able to use &quot;wild money.&quot; Virtual capitalism will change the money balance in the world.<br />You will find a tremendous amount of information and commentary packed into this book. Expect to encounter page after page of small print text without illustrations. There are nine tables and figures in the entire book. For the serious reader on this topic, this is a page-turner. For the occasional reader in this field, this will feel like a highly focused textbook. In the introduction, Hart describes the book as being written from memory, but each chapter is backed-up by an abundance of footnotes. Fortunately, the book is indexed to help readers find particular areas of interest. <br />While we can certainly appreciate Dr. Hart writing such a book from his ivory-tower perspective and manner, there are some really interesting aspects of this topic of value to the lay reader. Unfortunately, the design and languaging of the book does not appeal to that market. <br />If this topic interests you, I recommend this book. If it does not hold high academic interest, move on to another book on the topic. You'll get bogged down in this one.	2001-11-22

In the Beginning. A Voice from the Past. The Gift of Work. The Gift of Money. The Gift of Friends. <br />What is this? Is this the kind of book I want to read?<br />I flipped to the back cover of the book for insight to the contents. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to read the last will and testament of Howard 'Red' Stevens..&quot; &quot;Red Steves was a self-made man who gave his family everything-and ruined them in the process. Now, as his estate of oil companies and cattle ranches is divided among the greedy and self-serving relatives, one member is singled out for something special: Red's great-nephew, Jason. In a darkened room, isolated from the rest of his family, Jason is confronted by the image of deceased great uncle on a video monitor . . .&quot;<br />I began Chapter One out of curiosity. It was a story, not a touchy-feely book, like I feared. The narrative comes from an eighty-year old attorney who is reading the will of a very successful long-term client who had become a close, dear friend. As part of the inheritance, the old man's grand-nephew, a spoiled brat sort of young man, is given a special bequest. Each month he is to return to the attorney's office for a learning assignment. If he stays with the program successfully, meeting the approval of the attorney, he gains the Ultimate Gift. If he quits or doesn't meet the grade at any time, he loses his opportunity for the Ultimate Gift. <br />As the book progresses through the chapters, the young man, Jason, transforms from an insolent know-it-all to a much different person. The series of learnings, prescribed each month by the old man by videotape, gives a new meaning to Jason's life. Each of the gifts, a learning, is described in Jason's words as he gains new realizations.<br />I found myself surprisingly captivated by this book. I couldn't put it down. No, it's not a mystery or thriller, but it certainly held my attention. I can think of a number of people I know who would surely benefit from this book. One will receive my copy shortly as a very meaningful gift.<br />A word about the author. Jim Stovall has overcome blindness to become a national champion Olympic weightlifter, a successful investment broker, and entrepreneur. He is co-founder and president of the Narrative Television Network, which makes movies and television accessible to our nation's 13 million blind and visually impaired and their families. With revealing more about this man's incredible background (see page 124), I &quot;got&quot; that this is a man to be listened to. You'll gain the same feeling as you read The Ultimate Gift.	2001-11-20

Peterman" Through Life & the Catalog Business	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Like sitting at the feet of a guru	John Peterman became a legend in his own time. The creative entrepreneur is best known for establishing and growing The J. Peterman Company, a unique catalog company. Through his innovative work, his name became a household word for 40 million Americans. He is less well-known for playing second base for the Pittsburgh Pirates, though baseball has been an important part of his life for many years. <br />J. Peterman opened in 1987 with a $500 investment and grew to become a $75 million company before hitting a cash flow crisis and being sold under the dark cloud of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999. It was a wild ride that set new standards and broke new ground in the catalog industry.<br />Reading this book is like sitting at the feet of a giant of a man who took risks, challenged tradition, and changed the way an entire industry did business. Peterman was a maverick. People like this always have fascinating stories to tell, and Peterman is no exception. In page after page, he weaves the exciting account of how he built his company. Woven throughout are baseball metaphors as he connects his sports life with his business life . . . and his personal life. It's almost like listening to Uncle John spin the tales.<br />As you might expect, the guru has lots of wisdom to share. His down-to-earth advice is disarmingly simple, but valuable. It appears almost without warning as the text flows. Consider these examples: &quot;Once you realize that most people are keeping up appearances and putting on a show, their approval becomes much less important.&quot; Subscribe to the 'Economist' and the &quot;Utne Reader' as well as 'Time' and 'Newsweek.' Try Ethiopian food. Strike up a conversation with a truck driver. It's a big world.&quot; &quot;I might have a bad day, you might have a bad day, but that's OK; I'll come through for you on your bad day, and you'll come through for me on mine.&quot;<br />&quot;Most people related to the catalog in a very personal way,&quot; Peterman explains, &quot;almost as if it were a letter written by a good friend who can take you out of yourself, out of your routine-or remind you of who you really are.&quot; The watercolor illustrations and caring prose attracted a loyal following of readers-some who never bought anything but still did not want to be removed from the mailing list.<br />Did Peterman learn from his experience? As the book comes close to closing, he reveals a truth that should be heeded by all entrepreneurs. &quot;Entrepreneurs genuinely need to take on many roles in their understaffed companies, at first, from chief cook to bottlewasher. It can be exhausting, but feeling indispensable is habit-forming. Insidious, really. I never consciously pulled the tricks some founders do to feed the habit, like setting managers against one another in order to play Solomon. Still, I tended to be more involved in too many tasks, too much detail. Overinvolvement sapped me of my energy, perspective, and judgment at precisely the moments where they were needed the most.&quot; Great advice . . . and the book is full of such statements.<br />Interesting informal book with more learnings that you expect.	2001-11-19

Company owners and human resource professionals know that an entire industry has been built around this technique. There is an abundant supply of consultants, authors, and professional speakers touting the value of recognition, as well as companies that design recognition programs and sell the products that are used in recognition. <br />This book is unabashedly written by two senior executives from O. C. Tanner Recognition Company. The copyright is held by the company, rather than the authors. I approached this book with the expectation that it was designed to be a thinly-disguised promotion of O. C. Tanner's products and services. I wasn't disappointed. This perspective is not a bad thing, and a lot of valuable information is conveyed in the 111 pages. <br />I was a bit overpowered by the theme of the book: Managing with Carrots. The illustration on the front cover is a carrot trophy. Every page number is accompanied by a carrot-in orange print. All the call-out boxes and chapter subheads are printed in orange. Even the flyleaf of the book is orange. I'd have to label this overwhelming use of carrot orange as overkill. Even the start-of-chapter quote from Bugs Bunny was a bit too cute.<br />Part One is a chapter entitled &quot;Carrot Seeds.&quot; Part Two gives us Carrot Planting, Carrot Cultivation; Presenting Carrots, Symbolic Carrots, Communicating about Carrots, and Creating a Carrot Culture. Part Three is Carrot Harvest and Part Four is Starting Your Own Carrot Crop. The flow is to present the recognition concept, explain how to build a recognition program, then how to reap the benefits. A number of case studies sprinkled through the book provide an illustrative enhancement.<br />If you accept the infomercial nature of this book, you can gain some helpful guidance.	2001-11-12

In this leadership fable, Lencioni, president of The Table consulting group in the San Francisco area, stimulates our thinking with an enjoyable story that captivates the reader's attention. Identifying with Andrew, a troubled CEO, isn't difficult at all . . . and may even be a bit uncomfortable. The discomfort dissolves with the learning that comes in page after page. <br />Working late on the night before an important board meeting, Andrew O'Brien finds himself on a commuter train. Alone. Except for Charlie, who appears to be a janitor. A conversation develops through which Charlie, an unexpected source of wisdom, shares valuable insight and perspectives with Andrew.<br />The lessons are built around the five temptations that lead CEOs astray. The fable is well-woven and thought-provoking. Following the story, Lencioni presents his model: a summary of why executives fail. A self-assessment concludes the book. Though I wasn't that excited about the self-assessment, the value of the balance of the book overcomes any deficiencies I might see in those few pages. <br />The Five Temptations are choosing status over results, choosing popularity over accountability, choosing certainty over clarity, choosing harmony over productive conflict, and choosing vulnerability over trust. Lest you think that you can now avoid reading this book because you know the secrets, let me admonish you that merely knowing the words is considerably different than understanding the concepts. That benefit will come with reading the book, then applying the learnings to strengthen your personal performance.<br />This quick read can make a significant difference in your effectiveness and happiness.	2001-11-12

Let's start with a premise: we'd all like to get full price for our goods and services. No one really wants to be on the losing end of a discount war. . . . and in that struggle, everybody loses. Full price sounds like a good idea. But, is it realistic? I began Winninger's latest book with a bit of skepticism.<br />Full Price begins with an emphasis on maximizing value perception. When I saw that phrase in the table of contents, I wondered what this book might say that hasn't already been said by countless authors beating the same drum. Aha! The difference is in the countless examples that illustrate every one of the author's points. Winninger walks his talk-the value of his book is certainly maximized by the real-life examples. I can't tell you how many ideas I gleaned from those examples-page after page of examples and best practices.<br />Winninger, founder of Winninger Institute for Market Strategy in Minneapolis, knows his stuff. He's a professional speaker and consultant who's worked with over a thousand companies in many fields. This is definitely a case of &quot;been there, done that.&quot; You'll discover that value as you move through his 15 chapters. I chuckled when I noticed what the author did with the quotes at the start of each chapter. After quoting others for the first two chapters, he quoted himself for the rest! He must have enjoyed writing this book.<br />The book is organized very well. Chapter titles include Selling the Program, Vertical Integration, Segmenting Your Services to Targeted Customers, Owning the Customer's Buying Cycle, and Promoting Differences. This easy-to-read book gets more exciting as it continues, with chapters on Substantiating Value, Not Price; Living the Brand; Exploiting Technology; and Forging the Indestructible System. And every chapter is stuffed with best practice examples. Can you tell I was impressed with the way these examples brought the author's points to life?<br />The whole premise of the book is achieving Maximum Value Perception: seeking and fulfilling the highest need of your premium customer. Think about those words. Each is explained in the book, but let me share the questions that flow from the author's discussion: 1. Who is my premium customer? 2. What is my premium customer's highest need? 3. How do I determine my Maximum Value Perception? 4. How do I achieve Maximum Value Perception and receive full price? These questions are answered as the reader is stimulated, then we're off and running!<br />Fast read, summaries at the end of each chapter, validating footnotes, and a good index. This is a book you'll read eagerly, salivating at the thought of how you'll apply your learnings to overcome your competition. And this is a book you'll return to from time to time to stimulate more great ideas to differentiate yourself from the competition.	2001-11-09
US	52870090	RA33BGG501SW8	0787954039	729263949	The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: A Leadership Fable	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Engaging, insightful	This book is Lencioni's second leadership fable. Weaving a story around a set of principles can be an effective teaching technique, and Lencioni is skillful in the art of moral-based storytelling. <br />The first 136 pages of the book are consumed in telling the story of a CEO who discovered an effective way to lead his organization. The basis of the approach is a set of four disciplines, which are not revealed to the reader until the problem scenario has been established. This sequencing is valuable, since it forces the reader to come to grips with the real-life experiences of the characters of the story. The plot is intriguing.<br />The engaging tale holds the reader's attention strongly enough that there is minimal temptation to read ahead to see if the butler did it. The lure of the story holds your attention. The realistic scenes and dialog give an &quot;edge&quot; to the story; you forget you're reading a business book. It's not difficult at all to relate to each of the characters, even to the extent, perhaps, of identifying some of the characters with colleagues at work in your own organization. But there are surprises, so don't think you can second-guess this book.<br />The story told, the author changes hats on page 137 to slide into the role of consultant and teacher. He explains the four disciplines through a narrative style that I'd liken to a friend sitting across the table from you. But then the questions start. Lots of questions . . . and answers. This effective consulting style comes naturally: Lencioni is president of a consulting firm in the San Francisco area.<br />I recommend this book for CEOs, company owners, and consultants who serve them. You'll learn some interesting principles and how to convey them, but you'll also learn from the experience of reading the fable. Those who want to improve their communication of leadership concepts will benefit from the way Lencioni wove his story.<BR>Short book, big lessons.<br />No, I didn't tell you the what the four disciplines are. I don't want to spoil it for you. Give into the temptation: read this book.	2001-11-09

They affiliate with a congregation of people who think, believe, and worship as they do. Millions of people build their lives around their religious beliefs and principles.<br />Then there's business. In the world of business, profit is worshipped by corporate leaders and employees at all levels. Achieving corporate goals becomes all-consuming, with little room  for bible-based principles. Biblical teachings are fine for the personal side of life, but business is business. Or is it?<br />The movement known as spirituality in the workplace has been gaining momentum, with supporters careful to differentiate between spirituality and religion. The human spirit is central to the corporate spirituality theme, but God and religion do seem to find their way into the picture. When people express their spirituality, their religious beliefs underlie their values and approach, even if specific teachings are not overtly expressed.<br />In God is My CEO, Larry Julian surveys the landscape through the stories of twenty well-respected leaders. Each of these influential people runs a business through the application of biblical principles, with great results. You'll learn from people like Bill George, CEO of Medtronic; Jerry Colangelo, owner of the Phoenix Suns and the Arizona Diamondbacks; Al Quie, the former governor of the state of Minnesota; and Archie Dunham, Chairman and CEO of Conoco, Inc.; Horst Schulz, CEO of the Ritz Carlton Hotel Company; and Truett Cathy, founder and Chairman of Chick-Fil-A, an amazingly successful quick service restaurant chain that's always closed on Sunday.<br />The helpful organization of the book takes us first through an understanding of the Clash of Two Worlds. You'll learn about the relationships and conflicts between profits and principles. The ten sections that follow each includes a statement of the issue and Julian's suggestion of a solution. The rest of each section is two chapters telling the story of the biblically-based executives. The ten sections are Purpose, Success, Courage, Patience, Leadership by Example, Yielding Control, Tough Decisions, Servant Leadership, Integration, and Priorities. <br />Each chapter explores real-life issues with some intriguing stories that will make you think. The religious theme is, of course, prominent in this book. However, while it is ever-present, the biblical message is comfortably woven into the vignettes. You'll be surprised how fast a read this book is, as you turn page after page to follow the stories.<br />Roger	2001-11-04

More and more, we've discovered that information we thought was confidential is, in fact, public knowledge . . . or nearly so.<br />The question for us now is how to protect ourselves from the snoops-the marketers, bill collectors, stalkers, criminals, and so many others that shouldn't really know so much about us. Personal security is a major concern today, so this book is certainly timely. Hyatt reveals how much information about us is available for instant public access or can be uncovered with a little legal (or illicit) research. <br />Shortly after reading in Invasion of Privacy that I should never give out my Social Security number, I looked into buying a car for my daughter. When the salesman and I came to the question of financing, he sat down at a computer terminal and asked for . . . you guessed it: my Social Security number. After enjoying a good laugh, I asked him why he needed it. His reply: so he could check on what kind of interest rate I could get for the credit. He tapped a few keys and instantly knew my credit rating . . . and a lot more information that I didn't think was any of his business. Real life evidence about what this book reports.<br />And the book is filled with much more evidence of identity theft, credit card misuse, and how stalkers learn about their victims. And that's just scratching the surface! Reading Hyatt's information-packed book, you'll first learn about the threat. You can evaluate your own vulnerability using the self-assessment in the first of five appendices. With this knowledge in-hand, you have to decide what to do about your privacy. How important is your privacy to you? After learning about corporate spies, predators, and government surveillance, you'll read chapters that will help you determine your preferred level of privacy and security. <br />The rest of the book describes in fine how-to detail whatcountermeasures are available to you. Hyatt covers Computers and the Internet, Banking and Finances, Your Physical Address and Mail Privacy, Medical Records, Identification Documents, and Telephone and Fax. You'll be amazed at your exposure and how you can overcome that openness. <br />You may find yourself wanting even more resources after reading all the information and references in the main text of the book. A Comprehensive Privacy Resource List shows up as Appendix C. When you complete this book, you will feel considerably more aware of your circumstances. You'll know the secrets, so you will understand your vulnerability and what you can do to protect yourself. This topic is amazing as you dig into it, which Invasion of Privacy will help you do.	2001-11-04

While known for his coarse language, he was also respected as a brilliant tactician and terrific motivator. Those who served with him weren't just &quot;in the war&quot; or &quot;in the army,&quot; they were Patton's men. This hard-driving leader instilled confidence, acted decisively, and excelled under relentless pressure. His army moved at unprecedented speed, always on the attack and not on the defensive.<br />Patton did not write extensively; he was challenged by dyslexia. But he said a lot, was often quoted, and was written about. Historians have a rich treasure of who this unusual man was and the impact he had on others . . . and ultimately on the world. His approach to his work was clear and direct, making him an excellent case study and role model. Role model? A man who spat profanity in almost every sentence? Ah, look beyond the rough exterior that actually endeared him to his men. Look at how Patton thought, his philosophies. That's where the lessons are.<br />This book delivers 183 of those lessons in short, tight, bite-size pieces. This is a book you can read cover-to-cover or refer to as an inspirational resource. Each lesson is constructed as a Patton quote, with Axelrod's interpretation of the meaning, the purpose, and the impact of the words. The flavor throughout the book is how Patton's military style and experience applies to management and leadership of today's business organization. Or any organization, for that matter. <br />The beginning of the book includes an enlightening biographical profile of Patton to understand the context of the man. The volume concludes with some recommended reading and a helpful index.<br />As a reviewer, I'm tempted to start listing some of the titles of those 183 lessons. I'll resist, because it will be too difficult to present a representative sample. Every page of this book is filled with concise, valuable insights.

It's jam-packed! There's so much stuff in these pages, I found myself wanting some illustrations or graphics to break up the text. <br />Jaffe likens forming a business partnership to getting married. There are a lot of similarities, since the partners have to live with each other for-hopefully-a long time. Leaping into marriage without being very sure is a recipe for disaster . . . or divorce. The same situation faces anyone entering into business with another-for any reason. And there are more reasons laid out in this book than I'd ever thought of. In fact, there was a lot of material in this book that was new to me . . . which is good!<br />Before I tell you more about the book, I'll list the eight secrets. 1. Look before you leap. 2. Know yourself. 3. Know your partner. 4. Clarify your mission and vision. 5. Formalize your agreements. 6. Two heads are better than one. 7. Safeguard against conflicts. 8. Breaking up is hard to do. <br />The book is an interwoven combination of information, illustrative vignettes, and check-yourself quizzes. There is so much, I found myself wanting a summary. Aha! Chapter 10: The Secrets to a Successful Partnership in a Nutshell. Eight pages of recommended resources precede the index. <br />If you're considering going into business with someone else-anyone else, read this book first. Get a pad out before you read: you'll be taking a lot of notes. Jaffe's book may be more information than you wanted to know, but it will be just what you need to know.	2001-10-30

For most kids, being told they were weird might be traumatizing. Not John. He prided himself on being weird-different. Over the years of his career in human resource consulting, professional speaking, and college teaching, he has prided himself on being weird-just a little bit different, off-beat. The power of being off-beat is encapsulated in a quotation I learned in my growing-up years, &quot;It's the usual thing, done in the unusual way, that captures the attention of the world.&quot;<br />John certainly has captured the attention of the world with his work. And how he shows us how to make this happen in our lives as executives, managers, and human resource professionals. <br />Weirdness is doing things differently. The results can be very positive, both in your confidence and in the results you can achieve. Putzier spends the first part of the book explaining this and setting up the reader to receive and consider 100 thought-provoking ideas. This section is titled Tapping Your Natural Weirdness, aka [also known as] Creative Thinking and Problem-Solving. The double title theme continues through the other parts of the book, enabling the reader to comfortably transition between Putzier's weird titles and terminology that will be more familiar.<br />One hundred ideas are presented in the balance of the book, categorized in seven sections. Titles of those sections are Weird Ideas to Win Today's Talent, aka Recruitment; Weird Ideas for the Care and Feeding of Today's Talent, aka Retention; Weird Ideas for Changing Your Company, aka Fun &amp; Games with a Purpose and a Profit; Weird Ideas for Perks, Pay, and Pats on the Back, aka Recognition and Incentives; Weird Ideas for Educating Today's Talent, aka Training and Development; and Weird Ideas for Enhancing Your Company Image, aka Sales, Service, Public Relations &amp; Personal Satisfaction. Idea 101 is in Part 8, where the author suggests that you have other ideas in your head that you can add to his list. Remember, Putzier is endeavoring to stimulate your thinking, not just give you pat answers or magic pills.<br />There are several additional features that add value to this book. The Table of content includes a phrase under each idea listing to quickly explain what the idea entails. An alphabetical list of ideas appears at the end of the book as an  unusual, but helpful, index.<br />The book is easy to read and serves as a fine read-through in addition to a good reference book for follow-up.	2001-10-28

I've developed a habit of turning down the corners of pages when something on that page is particularly interesting to me. I discovered that I was turning down practically every page of Free Agent Nation! Daniel Pink has accomplished what most readers of non-fiction books desire: he's put solid value on almost every page. Your thoughts will be constantly stimulated as you move through this book.<br />Our lives have changed substantially since William Whyte wrote The Organization Man in 1956. The work environment experienced by today's generation-and tomorrow's-is radically different. Instead of being captives of the organizational mode, income-earners are now free agents, including some 30 million freelancers, temps, and microbusiness owners. The lifestyles and philosophies of this growing group will impact the labor pool, retirement, education, real estate, and politics. Daniel Pink's name will go down in literary history for Free Agent Nation because he has so effectively covered the underlying philosophy of a generation.<br />Free Agent Nation, an engaging, smooth read, is organized into five parts. The first part introduces us to what Free Agent Nation is all about. Chapter 2 gets right into &quot;Numbers and Nuances&quot; to give the reader a deep understanding. Chapter 3 explains how free agency happened. &quot;Four ingredients were essential: 1) the social contract of work-in which employees traded loyalty for security-crumbled; 2) individuals needed a large company less, because the means of production-that is, the tools necessary to create wealth-went from expensive, huge, and difficult for one person to operate to cheap, houseable, and easy for one person to operate; 3) widespread, long-term prosperity allowed people to think of work as a way not only to make money, but also to make meaning; 4) the half-life of organizations began shrinking, assuring that most individuals will outlive any organization for which they work.&quot;<br />Part Two explores The Free Agent Way, the new relationship between worker and employer. Part Three gets into How (and Why) Free Agency Works. Pink explains how people get connected-with work opportunities and with each other. While many free agents work alone, they are not alone. There is a growing community of mutually-supportive independent members in an evolving new design of society. But, all is not rosy in Free Agent Nation; this is not Camelot. Part Four examines the problems that arise from laws, taxes, and insurance. An interesting chapter (13) on Temp Slaves, Permatemps, and the Rise of Self-Organized Labor reveals the seedier side of this picture. Pay careful attention, and you can almost feel the changes that are coming.<br />Part Five engages The Free Agent Future. Chapter 14 addresses E-tirement, confirming that older members of our society will be playing much different roles than in previous generations. The chapter on Education gives some initial insight into some different approaches to lifelong learning. Educators take note: your lives will be changing . . . are you ready? Concluding chapters explore free agent finance, politics, and how free agency will influence commerce, careers, and community in the years ahead.<br />With all that said, let's take a look at who the author is and how this book was put together. Daniel Pink is a former White House speech writer and Contributing Editor to Fast Company magazine. To research this topic, he invested more than a year on the road conducting face-to-face interviews with several hundred citizens of the Free Agent Nation. He met with real people, who are quoted and cited by name in most cases. The text comes alive with the insightful stories of people who are living-and often loving-their free agent status. These case studies are beautifully interwoven, producing a delightful fabric for the reader to caress. Warning: you'll find your mind leaving the page and floating into day dreams and contemplations numerous times.<br />To bring readers back to the reality of the core of his treatise, Pink concludes each chapter with what he calls &quot;The Box.&quot; Included in this one-page-per-chapter feature are the key information and arguments of the chapter. The four components of this summary box are &quot;The Crux,&quot; a summary of 150 words or less; &quot;The Factoid,&quot; a particularly revealing statistic from the chapter; &quot;The Quote,&quot; which pulls one representative quotation from the chapter; and &quot;The Word,&quot; a novel term or phrase from the new vocabulary of free agency. As the author explains, &quot;Read only &quot;The Box&quot; and you'll miss the chapter's narrative and nuance-but not, I hope, it's point.&quot;<br />An appendix on the free agent census and a good index complete this book. If you're ready to learn about the evolution and revolution in the world of work, this book will be a treasure for you.	2001-10-26

Over the years, I have read countless books and articles, listened to tapes, and watched videos to learn the secrets to success. I've sat through seminars, workshops, speeches, and classes hoping to pick up one more little gem of an idea to improve my effectiveness.<br />In Charisma, Tony Alessandra has pulled all of that knowledge together in one place. After many years in business, and a whole lot of learning about how to be successful in sales, management, and life, I recognized quite a bit of the contents of this volume. I really enjoyed the refresher and reinforcement . . . and I picked up some new advice that I'd missed along the way.<br />The book starts, appropriately with an introduction to Charisma: &quot;the ability to positively influence others by connecting with them physically, emotionally, and intellectually.&quot; From the introductory chapters, Alessandra takes us on a journey through seven fully-loaded chapters spilling over with the secrets of how to fashion and hone that influencing ability. <br />To enable you to see the framework of this tool kit, I'll list the chapters. Sending Out Your Best Silent Message, Speaking with Authority, Listening Attentively, Becoming More Persuasive, Using Space and Time to Your Advantage, Maximizing Your Adaptability, and Expanding Your Vision and Ideas. As a reader, you'll find yourself asking your author-mentor how he learned all this stuff! Wow! Your respect and admiration will grow, followed by appreciation as you put the many principles to work and start seeing results. <br />This book should be required reading for every salesperson, every high school senior, every young person starting out on a career. People who have been around for a while, but who have not yet achieved the success they desire, will also benefit greatly from this guidebook. The continual flow of advice and wisdom is interrupted by a self-test in every chapter. You'll be able to see yourself grow page by page.<br />Hint to make this a better world: Parents, buy this book for your kids.<br />PS: Alessandra is also author of The Platinum Rule.

US	52870090	R3E7NLQZ6Z4J6	1587990725	542966901	Ayn Rand and Business	Books	5	10	14	N	N	Great Insight, Advice, Stimulation	Ayn Rand made a mark for herself as a philosopher, as an author, and as leader of a philosophical movement called Objectivism. Her books still sell well today, twenty years after her death. Best known are &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; required reading for many high school and college students. <br />I enjoyed reading those two masterpieces by Ayn Rand. Good stories, well-told, with some interesting points. But, truth be told, I didn't really get the whole message. Perhaps I was too young, too inexperienced, too sheltered, or too something. Part of my has always been curious about who Ayn Rand was, where she was coming from, and what lessons she was trying to teach. What was this Objectivism concept, anyway?<br />Now, I understand. No, I won't claim to be a philosophical scholar of Objectivism and comparative schools of thought. But, from reading this book I have a much greater appreciation of the Objectivism approach. I enjoyed reading &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and have recommended the book many times over the years. As a result of reading &quot;Ayn Rand and Business&quot; I have a much better idea of the motivations behind the characters and the theme.<br />I really like the way Greiner and Kinni put this book together. They teach us quite a bit about Rand, her life, and the personal side of this controversial acclaimed author and her followers. Fascinating! (Did you know that Allan Greenspan was one of Ayn Rand's disciples? Reading this volume was an enjoyable journey; I hated to put the book down and was always eager to return to its pages. The authors reach into history and into Rand's writings to explain how her teachings relate to business, and they use modern (very recent) examples to illustrate how Objectivism concepts apply to business today.<br />The book is simple in its organization: three sections. The first section devotes three chapters to Ayn Rand and Objectivism to give us a platform for understanding. The second section, Randian Work, presents eight chapters on Rand's philosophical principles applied to business. Included are rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, and pride. All are linked to the reality of today. This book really connects for students-of all ages-of business philosophy.<br />The third section of the book, Randian Management, delivers leadership-focused chapters on Winning through Innovation, Managing People to Their Ultimate Potential, and Leading with Purpose. The value of the book is enhanced with a comprehensive bibliography of Rand's writings and an index. The smaller size of the book, 5 inches by I inches, gives a feeling of reading something from a long time ago, like the book should be leather-bound. There is &quot;long ago&quot; in the book, wonderfully linked to right now.<br />If you enjoyed any of Ayn Rand's writings, you'll get a lot from this book. If you are in business-as an owner or a leader or a manager, you will also benefit from &quot;Ayn Rand and Business.&quot; And if you like to read though-provoking writing, spend some time with this book.	2001-10-09

There is some attention to e-mail correspondence, but this volume is considerably more comprehensive than what I expected. Young people, particularly, highly oriented to computers and e-mail will benefit greatly from this book. So will people in administrative roles where writing clearly and succinctly is so critically important in this sped-up world.<br />After 60-some pages on writing for the electronic medium, Booher launches into a wealth of material on good writing principles in general. On one hand, one could say this content takes us away from the title of the book. On the other hand, what Booher has done is really valuable for the reader: everything you need to know to put together good letters, memos, reports, proposals, meeting minutes-it's all here in one place. There's even a five-chapter section on editing!<br />Want more than this? Bonuses include a glossary of grammatical terms (Miss Hardy would have loved for me to know all this stuff back in high school). E-Writing will serve as a good reference manual as well as a helpful book to read from cover to cover. The layout makes it easy to understand, as well as find what you're looking for.

Do What Needs to Be Done: Every Employee's Guide to Making Work More Rewarding	Books	5	11	11	N	N	informative, inspirational	Bob Nelson has done it again! This popular, best-selling author of such books as &quot;1001 Ways to Reward Employees&quot; and &quot;1001Ways to Take Initiative at Work&quot; has created another valuable tool for the corporate world.<br />This book is not written for management, though it would be wise for managers to read it.<br />The readers will be employees, who will absorb a meaningful message about their role in the work environment. It's a vital message that most employees never hear. The audience that will benefit most is new employees. In fact, it would be a good reading for high school and college seniors about to embark on their careers.<br />The core of Nelson's message is that employees have responsibilities and opportunities far beyond what's delineated in their job description. Each and every worker should use his/her own best judgment and effort to do what needs to be done for the organization to be successful. The book presents this concept as the &quot;Ultimate Expectation&quot;-a message every employee needs to hear, but one that few employers explicitly state.<br />Employers are eager to have people on their team who take initiative, to take independent action to do what needs to be done for the organization to succeed. Why is this kind of worker so scarce? Because management has not conveyed to its employees that they are expected to take initiative; they don't have to wait to be told what to do. This message will resonate well with today's younger employees . . . if they're given permission or encouraged. Managers who don't know how to express or reinforce this concept now have a tool with this book.<br />After an introduction to the concept and an explanation of the &quot;Ultimate Expectation,&quot; Nelson presents Simple Strategies and Techniques.&quot; To give you a sense for the straightforward content of this book, here are some of the topics under the headings Think, Act, and Persevere. Under Think: Make Your Job More Difficult, Ask Silly Questions, and Don't Be a Complainer. Under Prepare, topics include Collect Your Own Data, Develop Options and a Plan of Action, and Shoot Holes in Your Own Plan.<br />Under Act, topics include Speak Up to Have Influence, Volunteer for Difficult Assignments, and Be a Person Who Makes Things Happen. The section on Persevere includes Persist When Obstacles Arise, and Learn to Enjoy Those Things That Others Hate to Do.<br />The next section of the book addresses what holds us back from high achievement: fear, frustration, and failure. Fear includes &quot;I might make a mistake&quot; and &quot;I'm afraid of being fired.&quot; Frustration includes &quot;I don't have the authority&quot; and &quot;I don't have the support.&quot; &quot;I took initiative once and made a mistake&quot; and &quot;Someone keeps blocking my efforts&quot; comprise part of the Failure section. A concluding chapter encourages readers to realize their potential.<br />The book is deceivingly small, with wide margins and extra space between lines. The open format is wisely less intimidating for the reader, making the book easy to use. That's a good selling point for this kind of a volume, which is useless if it isn't read.

This is not new. Some companies, some industries, have been operating with a 24-hour schedule since the 19th century. Now the issue carries greater importance since workers are increasingly concerned about work-life balance, career development, and alternative work schedules. The author of this book, Richard Coleman, is a consultant with over two decades of experience helping a wide range of employers develop the Best Cost schedule that balances business needs like productivity and profit with health and safety requirements and employee desires. All these factors must be taken into consideration, and there is an almost infinite number of designs that can be applied. Coleman's experience comes out early in the book. I was fascinated by all the factors involved in determining the right schedule. My learning was enhanced by example after example from the author's work that illuminated the reading. During the first few chapters, I felt like I was reading a continuous commercial for Coleman's consulting firm, but this barrage eased as the book moved into the latter chapters. While I am not by any means an expert in scheduling, I learned a lot from this book. OK, I didn't know anything about scheduling before I read this book. However, I now have a healthy respect and understanding for what goes into developing a work schedule for a round-the-clock operation. Human resource professionals, plant managers, and others with operational knowledge of staffing and scheduling will gain considerably more than I did because of their familiarity with the topic. Coleman covers all aspects of shift work schedules, even including Circadian rhythms. It's all here. Readers will learn how to better use time and human resources to maximize return on capital investment and equipment. They'll learn how to achieve greater results without overstaffing, certainly a serious issue in today's labor-scarce world. If your interest is in squeezing more productivity from every hour of the day-without squeezing employees, this book is for you. Ignore the 1995 copyright. The principles taught in this volume are high relevant, quite timely for what's happening in the early 21st century.	2001-08-25

The employment market has changed considerably over the past few years. More and more, workers are taking career design into their own hands. No longer will they leave their lives in the hands of impersonal employers who are bound by rules and tradition.<br />Workers want to drive their own careers, but they'll still have to apply for jobs the same way that applicants have for years. There are certain procedures and steps that are necessary to get a job. You submit resumes. You work through the human resources department that manages the hiring process, being careful to give the employment interviewers all the information they request. And don't attempt to interview by telephone. References must be provided. This is the way things are done and, if you want to get a decent job, you have to follow these rules.<br />Wrong!<br />William Cohen, a former headhunter and corporate executive who is now a professor at California State University, Los Angeles. Let's go a little further. He's a professor of marketing and leadership. There's an odd combination. And he's chairman of the marketing department. Interesting combination coming together here. But his bachelor's degree is from West Point, where Rules are honored religiously. MBA from the University of Chicago, plus an MA and PhD from the Peter Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate School. 40 business and professional books published. This is an author to take seriously.<br />But, breaking the rules? In employment that could cause some serious damage! Not so says Cohen as he punches through tradition in chapter after chapter. Sixteen rules are presented, challenged, and ignored as Cohen dumps a huge amount of advice on the reader. Three appendices on sample advertisement and analysis of responses, how to find prospective employers, and sample interview-getting letters add to the value of this book. <br />I got goose bumps as I read some of the tactics Cohen suggests! Why, he tells his readers to violate someof the precepts that are practically holy in the employment world. He emphasizes calling the decision-maker, rather than human resources. He advises readers to bypass human resources, ignore them! Blasphemy!  (Giggle, giggle.)  It's enough to make you shake your head!<br />HR people: read this book in self-defense. It's the enemy's manual. Or are job seekers really the enemy if they don't follow the rules? Not a problem, if you're a job seeker: whatever it takes! Let's go for it! Job-seekers: read this book to get the lay of the land and a stimulating blueprint of what you can do. Tight on time, no problem! There's a quick  main point summary at the end of each chapter. Want proof? Examples and illustrations throughout the book.<br />Break the Rules is a book for the times. GenXers will love it! And older workers will buy it to learn the secrets, then tentatively try a whole different approach that's exciting and scary at the same time. Daring. Think you're ready for this book? Don't wait till you leave your current job to get this book-Cohen advises that there are some things that you should do now to prepare yourself for that magic time when it's time to play musical jobs again. <br />Extra note: if you're self-employed, you'll find some interesting approaches in this book to landing new clients. Much of the marketing strategy (remember who the author is!) is transferable.	2001-07-22

Many groundbreaking innovations have been employed to create a model that works. If you've ever been a customer of a Great Harvest franchisee, you can understand my interest in learning more about the company and what makes it tick.<br />The author was employed as Chief Operating Officer for Great Harvest, so I anticipated that this book would be a great business book, full of insights into what makes this company so good. Well, that information is there, but it's polluted by pages of personal thoughts of the author's search for meaning. Two totally different themes-and books-have been combined into one. At times, I felt like I was in a jam session where the musicians were each doing their own thing without much concern about what others were doing. That kind of clashing of messages made this book a disappointment for me.<br />If you'd like to learn about Great Harvest's &quot;freedom franchises&quot; and how the company grew from one bakery to a network producing over $60 million a year with 140 stores in 35 states, you'll gain a lot from this book. The company was built on principles that attract a unique kind of franchisee. Little things like limiting work to just 40 hours a week and aggressively giving back to your community are explained to outsiders can begin to understand what drives these unusual businesspeople. It's a lifestyle thing.<br />If you'd like to share one man's experience as he struggles to find himself, that's here, too. Former Peace Corps volunteer Tom McMakin reveals, in my opinion, too much about himself. &quot;I wonder about myself,&quot; he shares on page 83. &quot;Too often I get wrapped up in my own little universe and pass on the negative stuff like some hot potato. Even worse, I catch myself on bad coffee days actually amplifying negativity that comes my way.&quot;<br />The personal stuff is woven throughout the book. It's irritating, butthen it also explains something about the people who have chosen to be associated with Great Harvest. They don't think or act like you might expect mainstream retailers to act. These folks are different, and that's part of the message McMakin conveys in the words and the structure of his book. <br />Rocking back and forth between a great business story and one man's quest for meaning in life, I decided to back to the cover in an attempt to re-center myself on what this book is supposed to be. Ah! It's McMakin's personal story about what he gained from working for Great Harvest. That focus begins to forgive the approach and the continual insertion of personal feelings, questions, and musings.<br />The Great Harvest Bread Company, itself worthy of a fine story, is used by McMakin as a platform for congealing and sharing his life's message. Enlightening. Worth the read, but be sure to concentrate on what's fact and what's personal feeling. In fact, you may even want to read it twice-one time from each perspective.	2001-07-22

Careful consideration of the alternatives and their consequences inspires enlightened employers to create workplaces where people can be happy, where fun at work is encouraged. <br />The question arises, understandably, about how to develop a fun work environment without sliding into counterproductive silliness. What's appropriate? Leslie Yerkes, a savvy management consultant from Cleveland, teaches that the key is the process. The underlying philosophies that build an atmosphere where people enjoy their work-and each other-are consistent with concepts that enable empowerment and a sense of being genuine. When people can be &quot;real,&quot; they're happier, more fulfilled, more productive, and consequently, more loyal.<br />In Fun Works, Yerkes presents eleven principles to integrate fun and work. After an introductory overview, her book devotes a chapter to each principle. An explanation of the principle is followed by a case study of how a particular company-a different company for each principle-applies the principle. At the end of each chapter a &quot;heart key&quot; share thoughts designed to increase the reader's ability to apply the principle. An additional feature, &quot;Another Voice,&quot; closes each chapter with a comment from an author, manager or business owner to further illuminate the principle.<br />The book is organized into four parts. The first, the introduction, sets the stage. The second section presents the principles with the support material described above. The third section is a conclusion and Part Four provides some other resources and an index. Among the resources are comments from over 30 authors, speakers, and businesspeople.  An inventory is included to benchmark how much fun is present in your organization's work environment.<br />Each principle-Give Permission to Perform, Challenge Your Bias, Capitalize onthe Spontaneous, Trust the Process, Value a Diversity of Fun Styles, Expand the Boundaries, Be Authentic, Be Choiceful, Hire Good People and Get Out of Their Way, Embrace Expansive Thinking and Risk Taking, and Celebrate-is powerful in its own right. The introduction of the principle is short, usually just half a page-at the most, two pages. This was a bit disconcerting; I expected more of an explanation. But, the meat is in the case studies. They're told by Yerkes in the first person, reporting on what she learned while visiting each of her case study companies.<br />No doubt this book will sell well . . . to all those business leaders-many of them in Human Resources-who seek ways to re-energize their corporate cultures. Combined with the author's previous book, 301 Ways to Have Fun at Work (with Dave Hemsath), this is a valuable resource. While the principles are important, of even greater importance is the case study approach validating that employers really do this stuff. <br />Yerkes obviously knows her topic. And she apparently sought an opportunity to place the book in a more popular realm by all the commentaries from other contributors. At times I felt like I had re-entered the world of the Chicken Soup series. The addition of an additional 40 pages or so of commentary from others does add some value, but it almost felt like an extra add-on that increased the page count without contributing substantially to the business issue content of the book. Ah, but all the extra stuff did add to the personal, human value . . . and that's part of the message of Fun Works.<br />With the search for &quot;magic pills&quot; to solve today's workplace problems, human resource professionals, managers, and company owners will make this book popular.	2001-07-12

And you can quote me on that!  This handy little volume contains over 650 quotes that will inspire readers and probably provoke some thinking. <br />Most of the quotes are different from what we hear every day, citing a very wide range of Quoted Persons. Sources range from Goethe to Oprah Winfrey. Now that's a wide range! Familiar folks like Mark Twain (&quot;Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been&quot;) and Martin Buxbaum (&quot;A dog wags it's tail with it's heart&quot;) and interspersed with more modern figures like Barbara Bush (&quot;Believe in something larger than yourself.&quot;) <br />A table of contents organizes the subject areas (sixteen major categories) and an index of authors enables the reader to find a favorite source quickly. <br />Looking for some different quotes? Some though-provoking words from Shakespeare, Alan Alda, Brooker T. Washington, and more? This book will be a good investment. Recommended for coffee tables and waiting rooms.	2001-05-27

Yes, but The Bounce Back Quotient is more than a book. It's a tool.<br />This volume is a tool to guide the journey of anyone struggling to bounce back from any one of the millions of life experiences that can knock us down a peg or two. When you need some positive focus to pull yourself out of the doldrums and regain your wonderful productive strength, this book could be just the tool you need. <br />There's an old quote that is sometimes attributed to Zig Ziglar: &quot;You don't have to be sick to get better.&quot; As I read this book, I thought about that perspective. The concepts presented by Linda Nash don't require the reader to be down in the dumps. Start from wherever you are and this guidebook will take you to greater heights.<br />We begin the book by taking an assessment. By scoring how true each of 52 statements is for us, we establish benchmarks from which to grow. Each of the statements is worded affirmatively, creating a positive and optimistic standard from the start. The scoring is explained, putting the process in perspective. The balance of the book consists of 52 small chapters with a restatement of the affirmation and a paragraph or two expanding on the one-sentence idea for improvement. Another paragraph or two offers some ideas of what we can do to strengthen that aspect of our nature, followed by space to take notes to personalize the growth experience.<br />I would have liked to see more discussion of each of Nash's 52 action ideas, but I can also see the value of the brief presentation style in this book. Looking for a helpful tool, a guidebook? Check it out? Looking for deeper explanation of how to reorient your life, spend a bit of time with The Bounce Back Quotient, but expect to have to do some more research, too.	2001-04-26

My attitude in approaching this book was somewhat less than enthusiastic. But, after two weeks of moving the book around on my bedside table, I opened it. I read a few pages before going to bed. Hmmm. Has promise. Seems a little stilted. <br />I picked the book up again a couple of days later and read until I could no longer hold my head up. The next night I went to bed early in anticipation of a good night of reading. I couldn't put the book down. Each chapter pulled me into the next. I was captivated!<br />Wait a minute! This is a mystery written by an accountant. Ah! That lends even more credibility to the impressive facts in this highly-believable tale. The details drew me in even further than the plot alone, which kept me reading anxiously. Delicious drama.<br />I'm reluctant to tell you very much about the book. This is one of those stories I don't want to ruin for you. Our hero is Pat McGuire, a young accountant who uncovers an intricate plot that was considered foolproof by the instigators. The characters are very well built and the suspense is surprising. When the word gets out on this book, it will be very popular. Everything Grisham does with attorneys, McMillan does with accountants. Embezzlement. Murder. International intrigue. A little stilted in a few places, but I'll forgive a first-time novelist for a bit of this. I'm ready for his second novel!<br />Oh, yes. I finished the book-on the treadmill. It's been a long time since I read a book on the treadmill, but I wanted to keep reading! No, you can't borrow my copy. I've already promised to send it to my brother, and he'll send it to my mother. Got the picture? Get the book, but allow for the disruption in your schedule when you become enthralled by The Audit. A solid 5 stars  for this one!	2001-04-01

His work is covered in his 1979 book, Anatomy of an Illness (Norton). Since then, I've had an interest in humor and how it helps us cope with the trials and tribulations of life.<br />Allen Klein has taken the concept a step further, exploring in great detail how humor helps us cope with death. As I began the book, I read about Klein's experience with the death of his father. Thoughts of my father's death came creeping into my consciousness. Do I want to read this book? I continued reading, and I'm glad I did. This book is a fascinating sociological study of humor and death. It's very well done, so well that the book could qualify as a college textbook as well as a very interesting read . . . and even a valuable guidebook for people working in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, or caring for a loved one.<br />The organization of The Courage to Laugh was obvious, and made the book easier to read, understand, and absorb. Part I answers the question, &quot;Is Death Too Serious for Humor?&quot; with four strong background chapters. The second part of the book, Seeing Demise Thru Humorous Eyes, is filled with an amazing collection of wit and understanding from a wide variety of sources. I became so engaged with this material, that I couldn't put the book down. I just kept reading! I also enjoyed the last part of the book, Leave' Em Laughing, that looks at the subject through the eyes of those who are dying. <br />Highly recommended for anyone dealing with death and dying or studying the topic. If you're a student of humor, this book is a treasure.	2001-03-18

We used to be able to disconnect from the office. Our home lives and our work lives were separate. We had a life, as today's expression goes. In a world of e-mail, voicemail, pagers, cell phones, and personal digital assistants, it's increasingly hard to have a life. At least a life outside of work. <br />All these technological marvels are wonderful, except that they keep us so tethered to our work. We can no longer easily separate the workplace from the rest of our lives. With these connections, every place is the workplace. Result: burnout, severely reduced family and personal time, and shallow relationships with friends and family. We've been trapped in a world that expects instant response 24 hours a day, 7 days a week . . . if we allow it. And most of us do.  But we don't have to!<br />Gil Gordon, an expert in telecommuting and virtual offices, shows us how to regain our freedom, privacy, space . . . to get a life. The book is organized into nine chapters, starting with How Did We Become So Attached to Our Offices. Get ready-in chapter 2, you'll learn How to Find Out if You've Gone over the Line. The balance of the book is page after page of techniques, based on Gordon's three zones of life management. Chapter 6 is critical: How to Approach, Inform, and Get Support from Your Boss, Clients, or Co-Workers. I bet you'll take notes on this chapter! Don't think you can do it all? Chapter 9 covers What to Do if You Just Can't &quot;Turn It Off.&quot; <br />An important point: Gordon doesn't tell you exactly what to do. He just shows you the path. It's up to the reader to determine how far to go, when, and why. Turn It Off gives you the blueprint, the skeleton design, the concept. It's up to you to use it in the way that will be best for you and your life. No, you can't borrow my copy-I've marked it up-lots of fill-in worksheets. And I want to keep this book.<br />Turn It Off came at a perfect time in my life. I had reached that point where I really wanted to break free of the bonds of total connection. While my desire was there, I needed just a little bit of moral support and perhaps something to call my feeling. Turn it off! Yes! I read the book. I paid attention. I followed Gordon's suggestions to re-think my life. I made some major changes that feel wonderful already! Now I have to discipline myself to stick with it. I think I'll put Turn It Off in my tickler file for three months from now as a reminder to check my progress. Thanks, Gil Gordon--I now have a life again!	2001-03-17

The author uses a number of interesting examples to support his point that there's a point that the ordinary becomes extraordinary. As I went through school and life, I learned the phrase &quot;critical mass&quot; to describe the same concept that Gladwell calls &quot;the tipping point.&quot; <br />I was hoping for more. As a business owner, I was looking for a how-to book, which this could have been. Instead, it's more of an historical narrative. If you like to read thought-provoking case studies, you'll enjoy this volume. It was interesting and entertaining for me as airplane reading. The reader is left to his own devices to explore ways to apply the information shared in the book.<br />The author is a former business and science writer for the Washington Post, now a staff writer for The New Yorker. This fact explains why the book seems to be a collection of feature stories that might have some sort of connection. Gladwell does organize his presentations, talking about stickiness, the power of context, the power of translation, three rules of epidemics, and the law of the few. I would have liked to see more strength to the reasoning behind the organization. <br />If you like good stories that look at some familiar-and some not-so-familiar-stories from a different perspective, read this book. If you're looking for a book to show you how to move your product, cause, or company to that critical mass or tipping point to become tremendously successful, keep looking.	2001-03-17

The reasons are always there. To get past that problem, invest time to learn what to, then get out there and do it. <br />This book is a compilation of questions that salespeople ask about what they think is getting in their way, blocking their path to success. Chapters are short, pithy, and focused. Beginning salespeople will find this book to be a helpful tool. Those with some experience will benefit from reminders about things we forget, that allow us to become complacent. Kick Your &quot;But&quot; could be a useful text for sales training sessions, building instruction and discussion from each chapter.<br />The chapter headings include how do I find more prospects, are your prospects right for you, and how do I overcome call reluctance. Other questions address are how do I prioritize and track all these prospects, are some sales too good to be true, and how do I handle negotiations?<br />Sales success challenges, like homework assignments, at the end of each chapter stimulate the reader to explore how the subject relates personally. These challenges extend the learning. <br />Standing alone, the book will be helpful for beginners. With other activities, the book is a tool to stimulate further learning for professional salespeople.	2001-02-25

Some of us are more prone to putting things off than others, but procrastination is a common human behavior. So, why a book for procrastinators? Who will read it? The people who really need such a handbook will put off reading it anyway, so what's the point?  I began this book with a skeptical attitude.<br />I read introductions. I often find some interesting gems in those opening pages. It happened with The Procrastinator's Handbook. Did you know that procrastination is a habit? And habits can be broken, changed? Hmmm. Procrastination thinking can significantly alter my performance and get in the way of my success without my even realizing it. I had never thought about procrastination that deeply. <br />Part One was fascinating. The author explores a variety of types of procrastination. On almost every page I found myself nodding with an attitude of &quot;yes, I can see that.&quot; And I'm starting to collect some tips about how to conquer the tendency to put things off. The vignettes are supporting my learning. This book is comfortable, easy to read. It's sort of like a friend telling you things you sort of know, but never really examined. New, acceptable information and insight. <br />Learning. That's what this book is about. Yeah. And that sense is reinforced by the &quot;extra credit&quot; assignments at the close of each chapter. I remember extra credit work from school; most of the time the tasks were fun and more educational than I would want to admit. Same thing here. I like the quotes at the end of each chapter, too. They sort of underline the message of the chapter.<br />Author Rita Emmett gives seminars on procrastination and the productive use of time. I felt like I was sitting in one of her seminars-gaining knowledge, insight, and inspiration in every chapter. She was talking to me. The tone of the writing gave me the warm, included feeling of sitting in a small seminar with Rita (see, I'm already talking as if the author is apersonal friend who cares about me and my procrastination problem.<br />Uh, oh. Folding down pages. And I feel myself making commitments to complete some of those unfinished tasks that I conveniently add to my to-do list so I can get them out of my face. Oops. She caught me. How does Rita know so much about what I do? Gotta keep this book at arm's length or this stuff will affect my thinking and even behavior.<br />Too late. I'm into Part Two: Why We Procrastinate. Boy, does this sound familiar!  By the time I get to the chapter entitled, &quot;Help! I'm overwhelmed!&quot;, I'm eager for answers. I feel like I've joined Procrastinators Anonymous. I need answers. Solutions. Ideas for changing my behavior.<br />Part Three: Proven Strategies for Conquering Procrastination. Hungrily, I move through 75 pages of techniques, highlighting, turning pages, making a few notes. Some of this material is not new, though maybe packaged differently. Most of what I'm reading, though, is fresh, focused ideas. This information and advice will help improve my life. I can feel it. <br />The last paragraph of text in the book tells the story. &quot;You can change your old procrastinating ways. Don't forget Emmett's Law: The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself. So go ahead and get started creating the life you want. You deserve a great one!&quot; Works for me! It's time to make a difference in my life.	2001-02-25

Ever since Bartlett developed his dictionary of quotations, we've had a fascination with words mouthed by others. Seeking succinct and clever ways to communicate our thoughts, we enjoy citing perspectives taken by others. The result of our penchant for quotes is one book after another of the utterances of the famous and near-famous.<br />What makes this compendium any different from the rest of the quote books clamoring for our attention? In my opinion, there are two distinctions. First, the book is organized into sections that reflect the philosophy of Allen Klein, the quote collector. In his view, people can change their lives by understanding the actions speak louder than words. Life change strategies comprise the rest of the table of contents: Alter your attitude, be grateful, believe in miracles, cultivate kindness and compassion, dream the impossible dream, embrace change, enjoy today, forget failure. The list, a good list, goes on. Under each piece of advice as a heading, the reader finds insightful, inspiring, and thought-provoking quotes.<br />Another difference I discovered was the source of the quotes. What a wide range of resources! Anonymous is there, of course, accompanied by Martha Washington, Zig Ziglar, Golda Meier, Izaak Walton, Oral Roberts, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Walt Whitman. You'll learn from Mark Twain, William Penn, Bennett Cerf, and Mother Teresa. Eleanor Roosevelt, Walt Disney, Barbara Bush, and Donald Trump join Goethe, Carl Sandburg, Truman Capote, and Susan B, Anthony. Howard Cosell, Chester Nimitz, George Burns shares his wisdom, along with Helen Hayes, Stephen King, Richard Bach, Brian Tracy, Pope John Paul II, and Martin Luther King, Jr. What a collection!<br />Great reading for those empty moments that cry out for something to absorb intellectually. The book's size makes it easy to read in the bathroom, while waiting for your doctor, waiting for airplanes, or enjoying some private moments while dining alone at arestaurant. Here's a friend you can take along with you.	2001-02-21

If you're a corporate recruiter seeking the right employees to hire for your organization, this book is packed with helpful information and insights. As I read the text, I was struck by how the content and language seemed to address both points of view. The challenge is the same: find the people who will fit the position and environment.<br />In today's tight job market, finding any people is tough enough. If employers take the extra time and effort to find the candidates who fit, there's a much greater chance those people will stay long enough to recover the cost of recruiting, training, and assimilating into the new organization. Therefore, hiring people who fit the organization-and whom the organization will fit-is vital.<br />The book is organized into four sections: What You've Inherited, Growing Awareness, Invitation to Action, and Support Success. A helpful fifth section, The Productive Entrance Strategy, summarizes the book's message in a valuable reference chapter. <br />The first section introduces the reader to a pattern of anecdotes that shed light on familiar predicaments faced by employers as a consequence of wrong hires. The problem is laid out well, particularly for those who have not spent a lot of time thinking about all the ramifications of poor hiring. I got a kick out of the chapter entitled &quot;Failure ain't cheap.&quot; All the subheadings in the chapter use the same phrase, &quot;Failure ain't cheap.&quot; Makes the point!<br />I found the chapters to be short enough and succinctly written so I could easily grasp the concept in a few pages. Each chapter concludes with a brief summary. The graphic on the book's cover is repeated in each chapter, making the reading a pleasurable experience visually, as well as intellectually. Section one provided a basic introduction to the subject, but I found myselfwanting more. What should we actually look for to get a good fit?<br />The second section of the book, Growing Awareness, began to address the author's concept of what should be considered for a productive fit between employee and employer. The chapter headings tell the story: Functional Skills Aren't Enough. Aha! It's not enough that someone can perform the tasks of the job. The next chapter, What's Missing Matters, tells us there's more to explore. Four chapters examine the Fit Factors: Alignment, Culture, Expectations, and Change. As I read these chapters, I got the picture. But, I found myself asking how to do this &quot;fit thing.&quot; <br />Just at the point where I was almost talking to the author, asking for more specific guidance, Andersson provided just what I wanted .Chapter after chapter under Invitation to Action and Support Success gave me more how-to. I liked the specific questions provided; helped clarify my thinking and helped me see my situation as an employer through new eyes. I began to earmark pages and take notes for my own work, as well as a reviewer. The summary chapter is loaded with tips, guidelines, questions-even more than I found in the preceding chapters.<br />Lots of good stuff.  The first step to retention is a good hire. A good fit.	2001-02-20

The 138-page hardcover was a quick and enjoyable read. Fagen's narrative wove together a collection of what Burns said, creating an insightful glimpse into a celebrity's life. As I read the book, I was only mildly aware of Fagen--he was practically transparent--as I read the biography. Fagen does tell the story in the third person, but brings out the character of his subject so strongly that I lost myself in Burns.	2001-02-12

I approached this book with a degree of skepticism. As a futurist, I'm interested in reading what others say about trends, but this one didn't strike me as worth more than a skim.<br />Whoa!  What a surprise! I started underlining on the second page-of the introduction! <br />This book delivers a fascinating look at youth culture and relates that culture-and its implications-to our future. It's an enjoyable read, exploring a wide range of aspects of the culture of today's youth, our future employees and leaders. I gained a great deal of insight into the Millennial Generation, and I've been studying them for a while myself. <br />Every once in a while, I shook my head in bewilderment or struggled to get a connection, but that was seldom. As I moved from page to page, I had a recurring urge to discuss parts with my 14-year old step-daughter. Her response to my amazement and learning would probably be something like, &quot;Duh. Don't you know this? Don't you get it?&quot; Don't get me wrong; Samantha is not like all the different types of kids described in the book. But, she fits where she wants to fit in the picture . . . which is part of the picture.<br />The author is himself a card-carrying member of Generation X. This perspective is manifested in his writing, both in style and language and topic. I felt like I was getting a private interview to gain a deeper understanding of the teens and twenty-somethings. While I won't admit to being comfortable with all that I read, I do confess to having learned something. Actually, a lot of somethings. Now with a greater appreciation of today's youth, their culture, and their perspective on the future, I feel more secure in what will come in the years ahead.<br />Screenagers, Rushkoff's moniker for the generation he presents to us, is a valid and worthwhile study. Page after page delivers food for thought and consideration. Are you ready for the future? To know the future? We're surrounded by the future-and its movers and shakers-today. Better get to know these folks, how they think, what they expect, and where they're going.<br />Now that I've written my review, I'll give the book to my 14-year old, already a voracious reader. I wonder what she'll have to say about this evaluation and study of her generation. My guess is that she'll agree. . . and then go on to tell me more. What an intriguing discussion this will be . . . .	2001-01-29

Employers who can be successful in attaining these lofty goals can dominate their markets, drive more money to the bottom line, and enjoy a stable, productive, and happy workforce.<br />Jack Stack and his associates at Springfield Remanufacturing Corporation learned how to do this. It was a fascinating, educational, and sometimes painful journey, with benefits that exceeded the wildest dreams of those who put the plan together and made it work. The secret? Share numbers with your employees. All the numbers that have meaning-from profit and loss to balance sheet, from sales projections to costing standards. The concept is that the more employees know-and understand, the more they will partner and support the company's mission and goals (which they also help set).<br />The most vital issue here, I think, is that every employee becomes more educated, more involved, more committed, and-end result-more loyal. They become a part of a team, rather than just workers. No longer is their relationship with the employer &quot;just a job.&quot; It's now considerably more, as they participate in the decisions that drive the company's success. When employees are motivated this way and have so much more control over vital aspects of their employment lives, they will stay longer with their employer. There are more reasons to stay than to leave. Result: a substantially more stable, dedicated, and effective workforce.<br />The book begins with a &quot;Players Guide,&quot; a chapter-by-chapter outline of what will be covered. By itself, this guide is a valuable tool to stimulate thinking. The questions are thought-provoking, creating a hunger in the reader's mind for more information. The answers are presented in the chapters that follow.<br />Stack makes it clear from the outset that he's writing for an audience of doubters and the curious and suspicious. The front matter includes a presentation entitled, &quot;Does it really work or is it a bunch of hype?&quot; Right to the point. The reader gets the sense, even before getting into the meat of the book, that this author will tell it like it is. And he does.<br />The author's higher laws of business are presented to place things in perspective. Consider the premise that Stack's design is to get people involved, committed, and supportive, and these postulates make sense. 1. you get what you give 2. it's easy to stop one guy, but it's pretty hard to stop 100 3. what goes around comes around 4. you gotta do what you gotta do 5. you gotta wanna 6. you can sometimes fool the fans, but you can never fool the players. 7. when you raise the bottom, the top rises 8. when people set their own targets, they usually hit them 9. if nobody pays attention, people stop caring 10. change begins at the top.<br />Is your mind asking for more details? What is this all about?  Sure got my attention, then we dove into the real message, the powerful concept of open book management. A listing of the chapters of the book will demonstrate the level of content covered:  Why We Teach People How to Make Money, Myths of Management, The Feeling of a Winner, The Big Picture, Open Book Management, Setting Standards, Skip the Praise-Give Us the Raise, Coming up with the Game Plan, The Great Huddle, A Company of Owners, The Highest Level of Thinking, The Ultimate Higher Law: A Message to Middle Managers.<br />This is a powerful book that, if properly applied, can change the way a company does business.

Their other books are &quot;Employer's Guide to Recruiting on the Internet&quot; and &quot;The Best 100 Web Sites for HR Professionals.&quot;<br />This book is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter, Defining the Best for the Talent-Powered Organization, focuses on selection with an emphasis on competencies. The authors' objective in this opening chapter is to whet the appetites of their readers, to help them understand the new way of defining talent within organizations. They assert that the new definition will center on competencies, rather than on degrees, certifications, or years of service.<br />In the second chapter, the authors describe the environmental context in The Looming Talent Wars. They forecast that we'll be engaged in an all-out war for talent for the next several decades, closing the chapter with seven questions to help readers evaluate their attitudes and preparedness for the talent wars.<br />Key Corporate Building Blocks are presented in Chapter 3. The employee-centered strategies the authors suggest are treat the workplace as a system, promote ethics, integrity, honesty, and trust; create organizational feedback loops; put people first; install an ethic of fairness; accept diversity; encourage openness; make work and the workplace fun; develop employee connectivity; and view people management as a strategic business issue. Concentrating on these fundamentals, the authors suggest, help build the foundation that inspires people to adhere to an employer organization.<br />In chapters 5 and 6, we get into the meat of finding and attracting talent. These chapters are loaded with valuable tips and insights. The chapter on retaining employees includes a discussion of key determinants to retention and lists of specific actions to take to hold on to good people. <br />The bookconcludes with a chapter on Creating a Talent Powered Company.

Remember all those things that Mom said would help you succeed, and those things that might get in your way? Well, we remember some of them, but not all.<br />Create Your Own Luck feels like Mom-or a good friend-giving you lots of perspectives, advice, and cautions. Azriela Jaffe is like a mom-or a good friend-to thousands of people. She's a wife and mother of three children, a nationally syndicated columnist, and coordinator of a wide network of entrepreneurial couples. <br />We've all caught ourselves observing someone's good fortune and exclaiming that the fortunate person is so lucky. Jaffe asserts that creating luck is a skill that we can learn. It's an attitude toward life that we can master and, yes, control our own lives. In this book, she shows us how in a conversational tone that's captivating. <br />The text is interwoven with stories told in the first person. The reading is so comfortable that I was drawn in to a sense of being one-on-one with the author . . . probably curled up in front of the fireplace. One after another, Jaffe shares Luck Builders, the behaviors that attract good luck. Interspersed with these words of encouragement are Luck Busters, warnings about the behaviors that sabotage the good luck you attract, and Luck Blockers, behaviors that repel good luck. Throughout the book are Luck Journal Exercises, suggestions to do things that will help keep your thinking where it needs to be. The book is well-seasoned with thought-provoking quotes.<br />The eight principles, used as the organization of the book, are Open Your Mind, Ask for What You Want and Be Willing to Work to Get It, Pay Attention to Your Intuition and Meaningful Coincidences, Respond to Life's Trials with Resiliency, Take Yourself and Others Off the Hook, Have Patience in the Right Dose, Give and Receive in Equal Measure, and Focus on the Positive.<br />And here's my recommendation, in action form: After I read Create Your Luck, I sent it as a gift to my daughter, Jennifer, a junior in college.	2000-11-26

The promotional program for the product has been highly creative, captivating, and unquestionably successful. Now ranked as the #1 imported vodka in the United States, ABSOLUT is celebrating its 20 year anniversary.<br />The story behind the bottle, the product, and the marketing campaign is interesting, as might be expected. Most behind-the-scenes looks produce surprises, intrigue, and stories that cause readers to shake their heads in wonderment. ABSOLUT is no exception.<br />Carl Hamilton is described as one of Sweden's most provocative and original literary voices. He's also host of the critically acclaimed television show, Dilemma, a political commentator, and a columnist for Scandinavia's largest popular newspaper. With this build-up of the author, the reader would expect an intriguing book that would be a joy to read. Even the cover of the book is designed to reflect the advertising image of black and white simplicity.<br />The book does tell a good story-about the bottle, the name, the development of the product, and the marketing campaign. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed by the book itself as I wanted to be. I was disappointed. While I recognize that the book will sell because of the popularity of the product it chronicles, the writing left me wanting.<br />Describing this book as a biography suggests a certain amount of genealogical research to illuminate the subject of the work. As family trees are researched, people uncover branches that really don't fit into the mainstream of the family's development. These side stories are typically left out of books that document family histories, or they're archived outside the main text. Not so with this biography: all that information is served to the reader in a number of seemingly unrelated stories that don't seem to fit in the flow. An  endorsement on the back cover of ABSOLUT suggests that &quot;the author superblyswings from one scene to another.&quot; My description of this experience would be less glowing; I found the side trips distracting, confusing, and sometimes irrelevant. It felt like Hamilton was weaving in every bit of research he had, force-fitting as necessary to fill the book.<br />I was troubled by the use of profanity in ABSOLUT. One would not expect to find four letter words seasoning a business biography. Perhaps this is the style of Texere, a new publishing company, but the language didn't set well with me. There are ten incidents in the first 50 pages of the book where the author uses words that might get our kids a dose of soap in the mouth or at least a good talking-to. If you don't mind reading the &quot;f&quot; word in a business book, it won't bother you. It annoyed me, particularly as I observed that the point could have been made just fine without the profanity.<br />ABSOLUT does tell an interesting tale, particularly if you're interested in the reality behind the legend of a popular product. The book is hybrid of a business history, a biography, and  expose, if you don't let the bumpy writing get in your way.	2000-11-19

They need help, and they're finding that support through partnering. The corporation of the future will focus on its core business, with increasing amounts of routine and specialty work performed by outside organizations.<br />Departments or functions are out-sourced to partner-suppliers. Other functions are turned over to other companies to operate within the host company's facilities as in-sourced service providers. Alliances are built in supply sourcing and purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and logistics. <br />People seeking to optimize their capacity and achievement-as individuals or businesses-will find greater success through strategic alliances, asserts Ed Rigsbee. Joining forces with others create an energy and strength that significantly enhances the competitive advantage of all involved. This book, filled with how-to information, will make the whole process of establishing and maintaining alliances a much easier task.<br />The first chapter will help you evaluate whether you even want to enter into an alliance. As you discern that such a relationship might make sense for you, the second chapter explores the types of strategic alliances. This chapter is filled with a wealth of examples that bring the theory to life. Your imagination will be stirred as you see what others have done.<br />Your interest is piqued. Now what? The chapters on finding and selecting alliance partners and developing your alliances will guide you through the process. Again, plenty of how-to steps and even a form to complete as you ask yourself essential questions. Yes, this is something that has to be done carefully, thus the chapter on Pitfalls, Roadblocks, and Land Mines. Once done, you want to keep your alliance alive and health-tips are shared in chapter 6. Appendices provide 20 pages of valuable checklists to keep you out of the quicksand, as well as a set of resources for further learning.<br />Much of the book is seasoned with quotes, some of which add to the value for the reader. While there are people who like to see all those quotes, I'm not one of them. I found them distracting, but appreciate how they may have value for you. I glossed over them to glean the value I wanted. There was plenty!	2000-10-23

With the  barrage of marketing messages, success will come to those who can cut  through the clutter to grab the attention of prospective customers or  clients. This universal lesson applies, of course, regardless of your field  of endeavor.<br />Marketing can be complicated; there's so much that can be  done. What should you do? Where should you put your emphasis? What unique  approaches might differentiate you from the competition? Need a guide  through this jungle? Pick Peter Urs Bender or George Torok and you'll be  safe and successful on your journey, your adventure. In fact, these two  would probably even tell you how good they would be for you. Their book is  seasoned with an abundance of examples from their own work that are at once  instructional, inspirational, and self-promoting. Aha! They live their  work! They're genuine. This reality adds to the value of their teachings  and enhances their validity.<br />The idea-filled book is organized into five  strategy sections, showing the reader what can be accomplished through  perceptions, relationships, media, leverage, and database marketing. Every  chapter is crammed with practical ideas to put your name in front of the  people who can buy your ideas, services, or products. Even the most  experienced self-marketers will find gold in these pages. My copy of this  book has numerous page corners turned down and lots of asterisks,  underlines, and side-notes. Yes, this is the kind of book you read from  cover to cover, then go back and work through again. And  again.<br />Complementing the main body of text are examples, in a different  color of ink, of practical strategies applied by the authors-masters at  this self-marketing game. These examples enrich the book and demonstrate  what can be done with relatively minimal effort. The book has three  appendices offering material for thought stimulation (seeds for  brainstorming) and additional resources of books and web sites. An index is  included in case you want to look up ideas that way. My strategy will be to  go back to all the pages I've marked, and that will take me a while. So  many ideas! <br />One problem. The authors chose to pepper the book with short  quotations from a wide variety of sources. Some of the quotations added  some value; most, in my opinion, did not. I found myself consciously  reading past the quotations, ignoring them in an effort to stay connected  to the flow of the text. <br />Bottom line: you'll get a lot out of this book  if you have any interest at all in marketing yourself to higher levels of  success. Buy a highlighter at the same time you buy The Secrets of Power  Marketing.	2000-09-08
US	52870090	R3MSWL7I25K9HY	0471380741	743783259	A Manager's Guide to Hiring the Best Person for Every Job	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Superb Resource	The labor shortage has spawned a number of books on finding, hiring, and  keeping good employees. Each vies to fill a niche, competing with a  plethora of other books seeking to address the same issue. This one's  different.<br />This manager's guide really is. It really is addressed to  managers, along with all the human resource professional who could also  benefit from the power contained within its pages. Rosenberg rightly  assumes, in her preface, that most managers are totally unprepared for  hiring interviews. Corporate interviewers-at all levels-seem to focus on  all the wrong things in interviews, rarely looking at how well the  candidate might meet the manager's expectations a year down the road. As a  result, we all ask the wrong questions, struggle to make hiring decisions  on the basis of inadequate data, and practically make fools of ourselves in  the process.<br />Yes, I was using first-person in that last sentence. Guilty!  As I read the introduction to Rosenberg's book, where she introduced her  dialog-based instructional system, I saw myself. The good, the bad, and the  ugly. Honestly, there wasn't a lot of good. All the errors I made in  interviewing began flashing in front of me, confirming that this book  definitely belongs on my shelf! Amazing-I was learning a wealth of valuable  knowledge . . . in the introduction! (Can I apologize now to all my hiring  mistakes over the years?)<br />Rosenberg teaches that there are three factors  that determine an employee's long-term success with an employer: the  candidate's ability to learn, the candidate's values, and the candidate's  cognitive ability. Rarely do interviewers even approach these vital issues.  Too often we hire based on a job description that's obsolete, instead of  the capacity to learn, grow, and adjust to our rapidly changing work  environment. The key is to determine what the candidate has learned from  past experiences, rather than just what was actually done. Do you know the  difference between behavioral questions and puzzle questions?<br />Do you hire  people because of something you saw on their resume, expecting them to  change? Rosenberg notes that 80% of the candidates we consider live  remarkably consistent lives. Their patterns don't change. This book will  teach you how to look for those patterns, make sense of them, and equip  yourself for much more intelligent hiring decisions. This continual  learning went on page after page in this relatively fast-moving book.  Another example: use job objectives instead of job descriptions (page  57).<br />A clear message is that we should engage in a meticulous evaluation,  examination, and exploration of the position before speaking to a single  candidate. And, then prepare carefully using everything known about the  candidate before conducting a structured, focused 40-minute  interview.<br />Rosenberg presents a process she calls the Master Match  Matrix. The crux of this approach is preparation, including the right  questions to ask. What questions might you ask? Check out Appendix B for  ideas-over 800 open-ended questions are waiting for you. This bank of  effective questions, well-organized, is worth the cost of the book even  without all the valuable explanatory text!<br />I was impressed that this one  volume contains practically anything you ever wanted to know about hiring  the right people. The chapters set the stage, then introduce Rosenberg's  Master Match Matrix approach. Next, the reader moves deliberately through  chapters on structuring interviews, questioning techniques, listening  (including body language), more tools and techniques, and even interviewing  for personality fit. Yes, there is even a chapter on what's legal and  what's not, followed by a concluding chapter on reference checking,  liability, and even termination. Three appendices complement the text,  giving us common errors to avoid, as well as interview questions and  additional information about personality fit.<br />The book's organization,  aided by a good index, make this a valuable reference book to pull off the  shelf every time you need to interview another candidate for employment. If  you apply the lessons Rosenberg shares, you'll spend a lot less time  interviewing in the future-you'll have the right people on board and  they'll probably stick around a while.	2000-09-04

I approached this book with  eager anticipation when I learned that Barbara Moses is the work issues  columnist for Canada's national newspaper, the &quot;Globe and Mail.&quot;  An earlier work, &quot;Career Intelligence,&quot; was a best-seller  according to the author's bio at the back of this book.<br />While I found a  lot of meat in the 226 page hardcover I read, I was disappointed in the  lack of flow I expected. I suspect that the book was assembled as a  collection of some of the author's columns or that chapters were written  separately and perhaps intended to stand alone. For this reason, I  recommend readers move through the book from cover to cover, but also  expect to use the book as a reference as they return to individual chapters  for guidance.<br />&quot;Good News&quot; is organized into four parts. The  first section deals with The New Workplace, emphasizing Living and Working  in TempWorld. Interesting theme with a lot of validity, but I didn't find  &quot;Temp World&quot; mentioned again until almost the end of the book.  Her tips for living and thriving in TempWorld make a lot of sense,  including &quot;try to define yourself in terms that are independent of  your job title.&quot; Moses asserts that &quot;effective career management  means making informed choices.&quot; I would have liked to see her continue  the TempWorld theme throughout the book-it would have fit nicely.<br />Part 2  explores The New Worker. Early in this section, Moses addresses the  blurring of work and personal boundaries, illustrating this challenge with  one of her many vignettes. Asking &quot;What kind of worker are you?, she  describes six different career approaches and what motivates them. I felt  she could have expanded this portion more to help readers use this insight  more effectively. Again, I was frustrated with the lack of depth; many  topics were treated more shallowly than I hoped for.<br />The New Manager  Section begins talking with managers and supervisors, offering them  strategies to address some of the common concerns of the new worker. She  talks about the old worker vs. the new worker, the manager as career coach,  mentoring, and how to give people a belief in the future. In this section,  Moses is clearly talking to managers, so her &quot;voice&quot; is much more  focused than I felt in other sections. A question in my mind was about who  the book was written for.<br />The fourth section is entitled &quot;A New Set  of Skills&quot; and begins with encouragement to become a career activist.  Other chapters on selling yourself, networking, and communicating take us  back to talking with the workers directly. As she moves toward the close of  her book, Moses predicts that &quot;only when people are empowered by a  belief in their own employability can they develop a more equal, rather  than fear-driven, relationship to their organization.&quot; She encourages  people to assume control of their careers because work plays such a crucial  role in who we are.<br />At four different places in the book, the author used  language that I feel is totally out-of-place in a business book. She may  argue that such expressions are in more common usage today, but she'd be  stretching the point.	2000-08-28

As we move into an era where workers are assuming  control of their own career destiny, education and training are  increasingly important. <br />People are looking at their careers differently  today than they have in the past. No longer do they place their faith in  the employer to provide all their learning opportunities. Now they must  create and implement their own learning designs-taking advantage of  corporate training, special assignments, and outside education programs.  <br />In the future, the movement will be even more pronounced. During the  years ahead, workers will be choosing their employers based, in part, on  opportunities to learn and grow. They'll be looking for companies that  demonstrably support education and training. Workers will be significantly  more intent on continuing their education-to build their skills, their  credentials, and their capacity to perform at increasingly higher levels of  competence and effectiveness. <br />A major objective of their ongoing  learning will be to enhance opportunities for advancement-with the current  employer or a future employer. People expect to move from job to job every  2-4 years, though not necessarily to a different employer. They will tend  to be more loyal to employers who encourage them to grow. Mentoring and  experience will be important, as will various kinds of formal  learning.<br />Some of this learning will be gleaned from corporate training  and development programs. Commercial seminars and conferences sponsored by  trade and professional associations will provide further learning  opportunities. An increasing number of workers will take courses at  community colleges and universities. <br />With the magnetic draw of the labor  shortage, young people will be pulled from the traditional post-high school  process into the world of work. High demands will drive recruiters to  recruit students rightoff the college campus. They're already recruiting  more aggressively for students at community colleges and four-year  institutions. Some companies will fund work-study programs, enabling  students to continue their education while working. <br />Education takes  money. Employers will contribute, at various levels governed by a wide  range of factors. In many cases, more funds will be needed. Employed  students will face challenges of finding money to fund their college and  university work. Employers who help their workers find solutions to their  educational problems-including financing-will earn their loyalty and  devotion. Companies don't have to finance educational endeavors to win that  appreciation; just helping the workers find funds on their own will be a  benefit.<br />Solution: buy one or more copies of a directory of scholarships  and place them strategically around the workplace. One good example of such  a valuable resource is The Scholarship Book 2000. The annual, produced by  the National Scholarship Research Service, contains pertinent information  on 4,000 scholarship sources offering awards up to $40,000 per year.  Included are scholarships limited to people over 25, 35, and even 60 years  of age.<br />Each entry gives the name, address, phone, e-mail, and internet  sites, followed by an explanation of the amount of the award and  application procedures. The variety of opportunities for funding is  mind-boggling! This volume has a wealth of information, and even makes for  good reading.<br />The 8&quot; X 10.5 inch format is easy to use. The cover is  attractive, making it a nice book to have around in break rooms, human  resource development offices, corporate libraries, and other appropriate  locations around the company. At a $25 price, this three-pound book makes a  smart purchase to send a message: &quot;we support the ongoing education of  our employees.&quot;	2000-08-14

That was a long, long time ago. Technology, in various forms, has been in our lives for many years. More recently, however, technology has combined with an increased velocity  in the pace of our lives, causing considerable stress: technostress.<br />Who  better to write about this phenomenon than a technology consultant and a  psychologist-turned-researcher? What a team for the topic! The integration  of their work was obvious and appropriate throughout the book. Weil and  Rosen explain in understandable phrasing the origins of our technostress at  work, at home, at play and in society overall. But, they don't stop there.  The authors also explain in careful steps what to do to control  technostress to lead more comfortable, yet productive, lives.<br />Weil and  Rosen help us understand that 80-90 percent of us are not embracing all  this technology as rapidly as we all think we (everyone else) are.  &quot;Because technology is being thrust upon them at a pace and volume  greater than they desire, this vast majority of the populace is also  experiencing technostress.&quot;<br />It is easy to see how technology has  taken over our lives, the authors observe, as they note that technological  intrusion has come from more than the ubiquitous computer. While addressing  e-mail issues, they also acknowledge the impact of the microwave,  television, the VCR, hand-held poker games, calculators, electronic  fish-finders, and automated doggie door openers that respond to a signal  from the dog's collar.<br />Boundaries become critically important in this  technology-charged environment. We long for the &quot;good old days&quot;  when work stopped at a predetermined hour and we were able to move into our  personal and family lives. Now technology has allowed, even encouraged,  intrusions into all aspects of our lives-from the other aspects. Pagers  chirp interruptions from work during family time; family phone calls or  e-mails findus during our work time. The authors remind us that  &quot;people have a clear need for their role boundaries to be respected if  they are to maneuver successfully through their complex lives.&quot; Then,  they provide their readers with advice and counsel about how to make that  happen. We need to reclaim our space to reduce our technostress.<br />I'm  writing this review on a cross-country airplane trip-conscious that I'm  using technology (my laptop computer) to exercise my efficiency. Yet, at  the same time, I'm enjoying the serenity of freedom from ringing  telephones, insistent pages, unwanted noise (I don't have to use the  headphones), and the siren song of e-mail. I'm in control!<br />We have become  technodependent. &quot;We [even] invade our own space by making check-in  calls to our equipment. We don't feel safe without electronic  connection-even though the process is disruptive and can be  irritating.&quot; We send messages, then wait for return messages. If we  don't get prompt responses from voicemail or e-mail messages, we become  anxious . . . even paranoid. Are we being ignored? Did the message get  through? Is the recipient all right? Angry with us? And here comes the  psychological teaching-&quot;we are missing the two main ingredients for  successful communication: connection between two people and exchange of  accurate information.&quot; We don't get closure and that causes  technostress.<br />The demands of unmanaged technology-the technology that  manages us-can easily surround us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There's no  relief, no opportunity to get needed &quot;downtime. &quot;Our nervous  systems are perpetually excited. It's like being in a constant state of red  alert. Humans need downtime, internal peacefulness, and uninterrupted  sleep. The body needs to heal, rejuvenate, and keep its immune systems  operational in order to fend off illness. Without these things, people  become sick, cranky, depressed, anxious, distracted, and technostressed.  This said, the authors again remind us that we control our lives-we control  technology and its impact on is. <br />The authors also raise the issue of  privacy, now a much greater concern in our lives. E-mail, cellular phone  conversations, our buying patterns can all be monitored without our  knowledge-are we ever safe? We can reduce our technostress. As the authors  counsel, &quot;Empowered by knowledge, we can make choices.&quot; This book  is full of helpful and practical knowledge. It made a difference for me,  and it can make a difference for you.	2000-07-31

In today's rush-rush world, anything we can do to attract the attention of potential customers is worthwhile. An incredible amount of messages are competing for the attention of the people we want to reach. Whether you're  running a business, offering professional services, running for elective  office, or promoting a book, it's important to have your name in front of  your public.<br />Quite a few books have been written over the years to help  us get our name into the public spotlight. Some have really sound ideas;  others are mere sound. With all these books and a plethora of public  relations firms, do we need another guidebook? I approached GETTING YOUR 15  MINUTES OF FAME with a skeptical &quot;here we go again&quot; attitude. I  was pleasantly surprised.<br />Ed Segal, a recognized master in the field, has  provided us with a powerful volume of ideas and techniques. The book is  delightfully easy to read, with 87 short chapters that each focus on a  specific methods of spreading your message. I read the book from cover to  cover (316 pages), but this work effectively serves as a reference guide.  The strong table of contents and index make it easy to find what you're  looking for. <br />The text is organized into seven major areas: How to Get  from Here to There (lots of interesting background information about public  relations), Getting Your Act Together (insights and how-to tips), Eight  Gateways to Fame (the most frequently used channels and how to use them),  Tools of the Trade (a wide range of techniques and tactics), Get Their  Attention (a treasure of promotional ideas), From Fame to Infamy (how to  protect yourself against bad press), and &quot;Thanks for Having Me Back,  Oprah&quot; (measuring your success and keeping it all in perspective). The  book's resources section is supplemented by the author's web site. Clever  idea: Segal can post fresh examples and ideas on his web site to manage a  dynamic, ever-changing relationship with his readers. This is a long-term  thing, not just read a book and forget it. I liked the way the author  cross-referenced the chapters. Whenever other chapter(s) might have a  bearing on an approach or idea, there's a reference to the other chapters  so the reader can keep it all connected. In spite of all the work I've done  to promote myself, my firm, and my work over the past two decades, I  learned a lot from this book. I recommend GETTING YOUR 15 MINUTES OF FAME  for experienced promoters as well as those readers who have been there,  done that.	2000-07-27

In today's tight labor market, employers are aggressively hiring young people. They're eagerly  chasing college graduates and ambitious high school grads who can invigorate their cultures and help accomplish the work  of the organization. These young employees are seen as the future of these  companies, and employers are anxious to move them into the main stream and  high productivity as rapidly as possible. Recognizing that many of them are  restless and will move on within a couple of years, smart managers want to  engage their new employees quickly to maximize their return to the  company.<br />In this light, an increasing number of employers are reaching  out to young people-in their recruiting efforts and in their new-employee  orientations. So, a book on how to become an effective part of the  corporate team might be a great tool. Wouldn't it be great to be able to  give the new worker something to read to learn how to make the most of an  employment experience from Day One? What a smart idea!<br />The Ultimate New  Employee Survival Guide could have been that book . . . a real treasure for  new employees and their bosses. Unfortunately, when I started reading  beyond the cover, my spirits dampened . . . fast. As an employer highly  sensitive to the messages that ought to be conveyed to a young person, I  was dismayed and disappointed.<br />The author begins with a sort of lecture  about how work is going to be dramatically different than college. OK, I'll  buy that. But he wouldn't let go of the theme. Once said is enough said.  Annoyingly, the theme continued to the point that I just wanted to stop  reading. The message clearly emphasizes that work is a 180° shift away from  college. OK, we understand that. Let's move on. We know that college course  grades are not given at work: &quot;The first thing you have to do is  accept it. That's just the way the working world is. Then you have to learn  new ways of judging your performance....&quot; The tone castsemployment in  such a negative light, college students reading the book may elect to go on  to grad school just to avoid the experience!<br />Holton does offer 12 Steps  for New Employee Survival (does &quot;12-step&quot; sound familiar?).  1.Attitude. 2. Expectations. 3. Breaking In. 4. Impression Management. 5.  Relationships. 6. Supervisor. 7. Organizational Culture. 8. Organizational  Savvy. 9. Organizational Roles. 10. Work Savvy. 11. Task Knowledge. 12.  Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes. The chapters of the book dig into each of  these steps, with explanations, advice, and &quot;Fast-Starter Tips.&quot;  The author encourages the reader to quickly gain a sense of ownership about  one's career. A list of Ultimate Survival Tips summarizes each  chapter.<br />But the most irritating problem surfaced in the advice that  Holton gives his young, impressionable readers. Most of it, in my opinion,  is wrong and might damage a new employee's chances of success. There is  some good mixed in with what I consider to be negative counsel. Judge for  yourself. &quot;If you persist in focusing on the fun in your life, you  only confirm their assumptions about you. Your challenge in your first year  is to show that you are serious about working hard. Once you establish that  reputation, you can loosen up a bit.&quot; &quot;Keep your eyes and ears  open and your mouth shut during the first six months.&quot; &quot;The first  year on the job is not the time to try to find a mentor.&quot; &quot;Most  new hires get noticed for all the wrong things they do.&quot; &quot;A bad  boss is not a legitimate excuse for poor performance.&quot;<br />There is a  lot of valuable advice in this book. The approach is worthwhile and could  help a lot of new employees. If you recommend the book to a protégé, I'd  encourage you to schedule some coaching time to interpret the content and  the attitude so you get your new employee started on the right foot. This  book could serve as a model for you to develop a new employee guide  specifically for your company-something that could help younger and older  workers as they join you.	2000-07-26

In today's increasingly competitive employment market, compensation is a powerful part of the package used to attract and hold top talent. Although recent research has confirmed that money is not as dominant a factor as it  has been in the past, there is no denying that the Almighty Dollar still  plays a central role. <br />If compensation is not designed properly, an  organization could be dangerously vulnerable to attack from the raiding  recruiters who do know how to do it right. Thus, pay plans become a vital  defense as well as a powerful attracting offensive tool. The problem is  that many employers, including human resource professionals, don't have a  sufficient understanding of how-and why-to pay people appropriately.<br />Pay  People Right serves as a fine textbook for those who want to gain a deeper  understanding of the right ways to reward employees financially for their  contributions. As the authors observe in their preface, &quot;Much of the  popular literature on management and organizational change avoids issues of  pay, perhaps because it's harder to address than many gentler and less  powerful change tools the literature proposes. Changing pay requires  patience and constant attention.&quot; They contend that compensation  design-pay and other rewards-can influence worker performance to the extent  that it can change a company's achievement and destiny. Zingheim and  Schuster suggest that compensation is even more of a strategic tool than it  has been in the past, particularly in these times of mergers and  acquisitions, consolidations, and globalization<br />Organization<br />The book  is well-organized for a read-through as well as for reference at a later  date. The first chapter addresses Total Rewards and the Six Reward  Principles. The principles begin with Create a Positive and Natural Reward  Experience. The key is communication and education. The next principle is  to align rewards with business goals to create a win-win partnership.  People who work for the company add value, which should be rewarded.<br />We  should ensure that everyone is a knowledgeable stakeholder in the overall  success of the company. That's the third principle: Extend people's line of  sight. The fourth principle is Integrate Rewards: move beyond total pay to  include total rewards. Fifth, reward individual ongoing value with base  pay. Evaluate competency, performance, and the employee's value in the  marketplace. I like the sixth principle: reward results with variable  pay-flexiblity, agility, responsiveness. <br />The authors emphasize the four  components of total rewards: individual growth, compelling future, total  pay, and positive workplace. It's not just the money. This comprehensive  approach leads to a broader strategy. <br />The second chapter makes the  business case for changing rewards, leading to chapter on integrating total  pay. The chapter on measuring and managing performance completes the first  section of the book, focusing on compensation being a vital part of  performance management.<br />The second part of the book addresses a wide  range of pay tools including base pay, short-term and long-term variable  pay, and recognition and celebration. The discussion on infrastructure  helps the reader understand the foundation of how compensation is designed.  <br />Part III of Pay People Right addresses how rewards are used in several  different situations. Readers learn how to reward teams, scarce talent,  sales professionals, and executives. In this section the authors address  how rewards are used in merger and acquisition situations and in the  complicated world of globalization. Chapter 15 on Global Rewards is  particularly valuable for employers concerned with compensating people from  different countries doing different kinds of work under different  conditions. The exploration of global talent as a specific focus was  enlightening . . . and, importantly, current. <br />The book is practical in  itsapproach. Theory is translated effectively into practice so the  textbook becomes a useful handbook, as well. The index works-I checked a  number of issues and questions of interest-to help the reader find  specifics to answer questions and get the job done.	2000-07-18

Building on core values, he created a whole new business concept that grew to become the largest retailer-the largest company-in the world. How did it happen?<br />In Made in  America, SamWalton and his writer, a FORTUNE senior editor, take the reader  through a chronological adventure of how a man started with nothing and  gradually built an empire. He based everything he did on particular values  that really made sense, though they were radical for his time and his  industry. Gaining an understanding of those values, their sources, and  their impacts, helped me better grasp my own values and business management  philosophy. <br />Sam came up with a lot of innovative ideas, but was  unabashed in his drive to glean ideas from his competitors. He had a knack  for snatching someone else's idea and growing it into something really  significant. Reading about these adventures was fascinating. I couldn't put  the book down . . . and I thought I knew something about  Wal-Mart!<br />Particularly interesting was insight into the unique culture of  Wal-Mart and how it was created and nurtured. Educational, inspirational,  stimulating. A great read!	2000-07-18

Can the same information be presented any better than it has before?<br />I'll admit that I opened this book, part of McGraw-Hill's  Briefcase series, with a bias to dismiss the publication as just another  also-ran. Surprise! Hiring Great People caught my attention right away and  held it for most of the book. Starting with the three-page detailed table  of contents, the book was easy to read and easy to use. A Manager's  Checklist at the end of each chapter offers a good summary for  reality-checking and later reference.<br />I liked the way each chapter begins  with a scenario, usually including dialog, that catches the reader's  attention and focuses on the problem to be solved by the chapter's content.  Nicely done. An abundance of examples aid in understanding of the authors'  points and in the practical application of the knowledge presented. A  common feature of the Briefcase books is effective use of icons to call out  sidebars and boxes that highlight and amplify the text. The boxes are  categorized as Smart Managing (tactics), Caution (warnings), Tricks of the  Trade, Key Terms (jargon explained), Examples, Tools (proven procedures),  and Mistake Proofing (how to minimize the risk of a bad hire).<br />The book  begins with an emphasis on competency-based job descriptions. Helpful  information includes definitions of competencies and advice on conducting a  competency analysis. The second chapter jumps right in with the legal stuff  that employers must be wary of today. A number of pertinent laws are  carefully explained so the reader knows what to do and how to avoid costly  mistakes. The chapter on attracting the right employees (note: not just  warm bodies) addresses recruiting as well as what today's workers are  looking for. The table on page 47 provides information on over a dozen  internet sites that can be used for recruiting. <br />So now we have all these  applications coming in. What should we do with them? Chapter 4 shows us how  to use those applications as screening tools in our efforts to find the  right people to bring in for interviews. Chapter 5 does the same thing with  resumes. Frankly, I was astonished at the volume of advice; I learned about  tools and procedures that opened my eyes about my own hiring. The next two  chapters on interviewing was equally valuable; again, I gained knowledge  that I didn't have before. Just when you think you know it all, this kind  of book comes along to remind you and give you some more.<br />Do these  applicants really care about working here, or are they just looking for a  job? Chapter 8 shows us how to evaluate how motivated that applicant is to  perform. The interviewing approaches are most useful, as are the charts and  score sheets to help the interviewer focus on what's most important.  Testing and background checks were discussed next-good sequencing of  chapters. I thought the chapter on testing got a bit too deep in testing  methodology for a book like this, but the information is interesting.<br />The  chapter on making the hiring decisions and notifying applicants includes a  weighting system that helps put appropriate emphasis on the most important  characteristics. I liked the advice about sending polite rejection letters  promptly. There are so many applicants that wait a long time-nervously and  needlessly. Chapter 12 advises wise ways to bring new employees on board  with the right kind of offer of employment and the subsequent orientation  process. The final chapter on blended workforces highlighted the  alternatives that employers have today, using part-timers, job-share, and  contingent workers to get the job done.	2000-06-17
US	52870090	R2WVJEL586SP2S	1893214028	639425192	267 Hire Tough Proven Interview Questions	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A Really Valuable Resource	Even in today's seller's market in employment, we need to screen prospective employees before we hire them. The interview process becomes particularly important as we strive to select the right people to work in  our environment-that cultural match thing.<br />So, we've sorted through the  resumes, applications, and referrals. We've done some good work with  selection instruments. Now it's time for the interview. What shall we ask?  How do we open conversation to learn more about the preferred applicants?  Oh, sure, we have the old standby questions we've been asking for years.  But, there's this nagging feeling that we should have even more  questions-better questions-to really draw out the core of who these  applicants really are.<br />If you're looking for answers-er, questions, Mel  Kleiman's handy guidebook is fully loaded. It's a small book, 5&quot; by  8&quot;, saddle-stitched, 44 pages. But that almost throw-away packaging is  deceiving. I've seen lots of interview questions in my time, but this book  has some really good ones that I've never seen before. And the questions  Kleiman considers key to a good interview are in boldface type. The book is  easy to use.<br />The book begins with a chapter on planning the interview.  Kleiman builds his approach on his four CAPS categories. The CAPS acronym  represents the Capacities, Attitudes, Personality traits, and Skills needed  to fulfill job responsibilities. He explains what each area of concern  means, and why each is important. Of course, different weights may be  placed on each aspect of an applicant's qualifications, depending on the  job.<br />The second chapter, shown in the table of contents as  &quot;Structuring the Interview,&quot; is actually titled &quot;The Best  Interviews are Conversations, Not Inquisitions.&quot; The purpose of the  job interview is not interrogation, but facilitation of open discussion.  The emphasis is on information gathering. Kleiman points out the importance  of getting theapplicant to talk, rather than the interviewer. He also  warns us not to explain questions asked, to avoid unintentionally giving  away the answer you're looking for. His advice to stick to short,  open-ended questions will be worth at least the price of the book to many  readers . . . and we haven't even gotten to the questions yet!<br />The  questions themselves are loosely organized around the CAPS design. I say  &quot;loosely&quot; because Kleiman offers more than just the four  principal categories. The chapters all have equal weight, with the CAPS  categories mixed in with the others-not quite the organization I might have  expected, given his emphasis on CAPS. <br />Categories of questions are  Capacities (17), Education (29), Current Work Experience (21), Past Work  Experience (17), Corporate Culture (15), Personal Effectiveness (17),  Attitudes (31), Personality (29), Insight (34), Situational (36), and  Skills (13). Now, with that knowledge of his categories . . . quick! Write  267 good questions to ask applicants!<br />Can't do it can you? How many did  you come up with? Probably nowhere near 267. Did you remember &quot;Have  you ever been discipline on the job or at school? Explain?&quot; That's  number 9 in the first set of questions (each category is separately  numbered, rather than 1-267 running through the entire book). How about  &quot;How did your education prepare you for the real world?&quot; Have you  ever asked for a copy of an applicant's most recent performance  appraisal?<br />&quot;What distinguishes a good employee from an average  one&quot; will certainly open some discussion and, no doubt, create  opportunities for some interesting follow-on questions. &quot;Since  everyone in an organization doesn't necessarily like everyone else, what  would the people who don't like you say about you?&quot; Intriguing  question?<br />Reading the book, I came up with an interesting idea which we  have implemented in our organization. During our weekly staff meetings, we  now toss out one of Kleiman's questions for all of us to answer. We're all  getting to know each other even better!	2000-05-05

For a long time now, there we've needed a  book that integrates the major elements that affect staffing. Many that  address the individual topics are either very dry and technical or lightly  gloss over these key with anecdotes and stories.

It uses the logical process of  following an employee through hiring, orientation, training, rewarding, and  retention. It outlines into numerous valuable strategies, resources, case  studies, and examples.<br />The book's content is organized into five steps:  1) Think before you hire  2) Locate qualified applicants  3) Interview and  select your new employee 4) Keep and reward top employees 5) Learn from  your losses.<br />Its forty pages of appendices provide valuable tools, such  as an Exit Interview Worksheet, Final Exit Interview Format, and Applicant  Reference Sheets.<br />Strategies, such as the Executive Interview, provide  ways not only for the executive to keep in touch with employees, but also  ways to spot problems and reduce turnover as well. For example, Outlaw does  not just suggest this strategy, he gives a logical, easy-to-follow format  that an individual reader or a corporation can put to use right  away.<br />Smart Staffing is written by a professional who understands how to  recruit and keep top employees.
