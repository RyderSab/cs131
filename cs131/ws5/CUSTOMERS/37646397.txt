US	37646397	R1KFYG17TFBGAZ	0300093764	851902549	Memoirs of a Warsaw Ghetto Fighter	Books	4	13	13	N	N	The young man that survived	Kazik was a 19-year-old Jewish lad who survived the Nazi terror and systematic mass killings of Jews, the Warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943 and the Warsaw uprising of 1944.<br />He was also led many fighters out of the ghetto through the sewer, and he was responsible for the care of many Jews who were hiding in Polish homes. Kazik also managed to find shelters for his parents and his two sisters, and after the war he was one of the very few Jews whose parents were still alive. After the war, Kazik, his sister Raya and parents all immigrated to Israel. Kazik's other sister, Dina, was killed during the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Kazik didn't at that time know that his sister was in the ghetto.<br /><br />I found the book interesting and heart gripping at the same time. It is amazing to read how Kazik manages to stay alive, and always seems to stay one step ahead of the Nazis and their helpers.<br /><br />Kazik writes how he found one thing difficult when he arrived in Israel: When he told people that he was one of the very few survivors, it seemed like some almost blamed him for having survived. Kazik tells how people kept on asking him about people who had died, but never about those who had survived. This made him reluctant to talk about his past.<br />He writes about how one man told him that he (= Kazik) screamed every night in his sleep.<br />If Kazik had made a volume II about his life after the war, I surely would have read the book. His history is fascinating, and I hope his life was mainly a happy one after he immigrated to Israel.<br />I liked this book, and I found Kazik's story very interesting. Kazik tells us that he is not much of a talker, and that it was therefore difficult to dictate this book to the writer. Kazik may not be a talker or a skilled writer, but his story is one it is hard to forget.	2005-07-18

I then decided to read the book that the film is based on, and I found that the book was just as good as the film. They are both very well made.  <br /> <br />Wladyslaw Szpilman wrote his story just after the war ended and after he was given this advice: If you want to be able to get on with your life after all you have been through; see a psychiatrist or write a book. <br /> <br />Szpilman decided to write a book, and I think he did a very good job doing so. I found the book well written, and his story was heart breaking. His entire family was gassed to death in Treblinka, while he was among the few you survived among the Polish Jews. I read somewhere else that 90 per cent of all Polish Jews died during World War II. The odds were against Wladyslaw Szpilman, but he made it. His story is important, because we must not forget what happened. The world society has to do it best to prevent history to repeat itself. <br /> <br />I have read that Wladyslaw Szpilman continued as a composer and musician after the war. He was a popular man. Some years after the war he married a doctor and had two sons. One of his sons told a reporter that he didn't know about his father's past before he found a copy of this book hidden in his father's home. 'The Pianist' was published under another title in 1946, but the Communists denied the book to be printed during the cold war. It wasn't before after Poland had regained its freedom again, the book could be published once more. It's a great book, and I recommend it to everyone. <br />	2005-07-13

You learn about two teenagers who meet and fall in love. The young couple is David and Susan, and they both have a far from easy life behind them so far. Susan's parents had a violent relationship, and sometimes Susan's dad would threaten to kill Susan's mum. Three weeks after their divorce Susan's dad commits suicide, and a couple of weeks later Susan's mum remarries. Susan's new step-father sexually abuses her, and when her mum finds out, she decides to stay with her new man. Several members of Susan's family have committed or attempted to commit suicide, and some (like her father) have been too fond of alcohol.    Even though David's family background may not be as bad as Susan's, his life hasn't been too easy either. His father tried to commit suicide, while his mother was very religious. In the end David decides to follow his brother and move in with his grandmother. Another blow happens in his life while he is dating Susan: His brother Daniel dies. Because Susan is pregnant, Susan's mother presses on and the young couple marries two weeks later.    After reading the book and some additional information, I am sitting with the impression that these two should never have started a family. They were far too immature and their troubled background made things even worse. They fight a lot and both have extra-marital affairs. David seems to have big problems in sticking to one woman at the time. Susan's second pregnancy is a tough one, and David seems too immature to face it. He finds new love with Tiffany, and instead of staying with his pregnant wife and baby Michael, he spends his time with her. For a short while David splits up with Tiffany, and she becomes crazy and starts to keep David and his family awake at night. My opinion is that David does little to protect his family during this time.    Shortly after Alexander's birth Susan and David parts again, and just over a year later; in a period of six weeks Susan has four lovers: Her boyfriend, her boyfriend's father, Susan's stepfather and David.    In the middle of all this there are two small innocent babies: Michael and Alexander. They are bystanders, while their parents try to figure out their lives. Their lives gets a very cruel and tragic end when their disturbed mother kills them.    It wasn't difficult to get through the book, even though the narrative is of average quality. Still, the picture of these two innocent children and their father's story about their short lives, make this into a book it is very difficult to forget.	2005-06-22

He had become very popular after he had played very well during World Cup 1990, and he was praised as a huge talent when he returned to England. Not long after he was bought by an Italian club named Lazio, and the author of this book, Jane Nottage, became his consultant. <br /> <br />After a while Jane Nottage was given her notice, and she responded by writing this book. In this book she tells a lot about Paul Gascoigne's life on and off the pitch, and she reveals that she wasn't very happy with the soccer player's wife. Jane Nottage portrays her as bossy and difficult. The author does mention that Sheryl Gascoigne had told her that her husband once had pinned her to a wall and told her she wasn't the greatest and that she was not allowed to socialize with the other soccer wives. Still, it doesn't seem to ring a bell for the author: Only later were we able to see photos of a bruised and battered wife in the papers. <br /> <br />The book is easy to read, but I must admit it I prefer Paul Gascoigne's own book. Somehow Nottage's book is too superficial, and all the time I feel that she wrote the book because she is upset that she got the boot. It's obvious that she blames Sheryl Gascoigne for this.  <br />	2005-06-19

It is a very captivating book about how 18 Jews survived in the very heart of Nazi Germany during World War. Some managed to keep their families somewhat intact, while others were the only survivor among their entire family.  <br /> <br />They survived in different ways, but all had at least one person helping them. One of the things I liked the most with this book; was the very fact that it tells the stories of brave and good Germans who risked their lives in order to help fellow citizens. Despite the fact that they had had to live with Hitler's propaganda and terror for more than a decade, they still aimed to do their best. Even though many survivors and rescuers often were lucky, I was amazed about how clever they were and how they managed to stay alive. <br /> <br />On the front cover of the book Los Angeles Times is quoted to have written: \\"[Reads] like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller\\", and I agree with them. The book was very well written, and it was very hard to put it down. I found myself reading until I went to sleep, and next morning I managed to read another chapter before I went to work. I read the book in no time, and I was only sorry I had finished it. I wanted to keep on reading.  <br />The big difference between this book and a Hitchcock thriller is of course that: \\"The Last Jews in Berlin\\" is not fiction. <br /> <br />The only thing that I missed was photos of the people I read about. Still, the book is so good I find it really deserves five stars <br />	2005-06-18

The main topic of this book is how Jews were saved from the clutches of Gestapo in Norway during World War II. There were not many Jews in Norway when the country was occupied by the Germans. In fact it was less than 2000. Among those nearly 800 were sent to the death camps in Germany and Poland, while the rest were rescued.    The Nazis enforced a law that said that anyone who sheltered or in any other way saved a Jew, would be executed. Since there were traitors working for the Gestapo, this was a very serious threat. And, a lot of good men were betrayed. Even so, many chose to help, and some had to pay with their own lives. The first chapter of the book focuses on those times when the rescue missions went wrong, while the rest of the book primarily is about all those rescue operations that were successful. The author let you get to know both the Jews and members of the Norwegian resistance.    He writes that many Jews could not believe how bad things were to turn out, and many did not want to escape. Others tried to escape at once, but were told by the Swedish authorities that being a Jew; was not a good enough reason to be granted asylum. In the end the long border to Sweden was what saved most Jews: In 1945 the very majority of the Norwegian Jews who managed to survive, had found a sanctuary in just our neutral neighbouring country. For a smaller group, Great Britain meant refuge.    There is also a chapter about Denmark and their great effort that saved 95 per cent of their Jews. The author also tell us the reasons that the Danes could save so many more than what the Norwegians were able to do. One thing in Denmark was that Germans in power were very unwilling to send the Jews to Germany.    I found this book to be very informative, exciting and interesting.	2005-06-06

In 1953, Susan meets the love of her life. His name is Azziz and he is an Iraqi student in England. They fall in love, marry and have a son named John. Iraq is under British rule, and just some few months before Azziz has finished his studies, the British orders him back to Baghdad. Susan writes that this is because the members of the old colonial rule want to keep their good jobs and all that comes with them. <br /> <br />Susan's arrival in Iraq is a shock, and her meeting with her new in-laws an even bigger one. Many don't like her because she is a foreigner and of Christian faith. I guess many married women have experienced clashes and disagreements with their mother-in-laws and other female members of their husband's family, but I believe very few have experienced that any of them have tried to kill them. That is what happens to Susan. One of the older women tries to poison her, and only a good female Iraqi doctor manages to save her. The elderly woman is never sued, but Azziz and Susan decides it is time to move to another home. <br /> <br />Susan also writes about her horror when she sees a man just takes up his robe and urinates up a wall in the city; his bare bottom for everyone to see. When she calls out to her husband, he reprimands her not to look. And even though Susan praises her own husband as a good hearted and kind man, she tells that she sees many women who are beaten by their husbands. <br /> <br />Susan spends 40 years in Iraq. She writes about a society where foreigners are hated and despised. The political terror is increasing, while Saddam Hussein pulls his country into the Iraq-Iran war and Gulf War I. Still, she becomes fond of Iraq. <br /> <br />During Gulf War I her family has to escape, and they drive into the \\"killing fields\\" of Kurdistan. In the end her family has no petrol for their car and no food to eat. It is very cold in the mountains in Northern Iraq (which is where the Kurds live). Many mothers see their children die. <br /> <br />One of her sons, Peter, is an Iraqi soldier, and he is afraid that Saddam Hussein is going to execute him as a deserter. He tells his mother about his fears, and they are both relieved when they are told that all deserters are pardoned. <br /> <br />Susan has one big advantage, and that is her British citizenship. She is allowed to return to her home of origin, and later on her husband is allowed to join her.  <br /> <br />Susan Francis experienced a lot during her 40 years in Iraq, both good and bad. She writes that she misses Iraq. Her family; children and grandchildren are there, and since she was just over 20, it is where she has spent most of her life. And despite all the troubled times, Iraq has become home.    <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book, and it was very interesting to read Susan's story. <br />	2005-04-17

He was tortured; badly beaten, denied food and in so many ways humiliated and ill-treated. Still, he never lost his faith and dignity.  <br /> <br />Since Cliff Acree was a higher ranking officer, it was obvious that he was better informed than his fellow prisoners of war. When he refused to share any of this information with his captors, it made Saddam Hussein's men treat him harsher than many others. <br /> <br />Col.Cliff Acree decided he had to lie to Saddam Hussein's men, and that may be a reason he is still alive. If he had kept on refusing to speak, the ill-treatment may even have been worse. Another reason he is alive is: When Saddam Hussein used the captured pilots, as well as members of the SAS and a CBS TV crew as human shields, only two instead of five bombers attacked the building they were kept in. The bombers didn't bomb the part where the cells were sited.  <br /> <br />One of the comments in the book also made me think of Captain Scott Speicher, since he is the American air man that Saddam Hussein most likely kept.  <br />	2005-03-22

Brace was among the handful few who came home. Brace was captured in 1965, and he wasn't allowed to return back home before 1973. While he was in captivity he was tortured and for many years he was held in a small bamboo cage. At one point this kind of treatment made him unable to stand on his feet. <br />Later on he was moved to Hanoi and after a while allowed company with fellow American POWs. The first American he came in contact with was John McCain. He taught Brace how to make use of his tin cup to make Morse signals. In this way the prisoners were able to communicate. Later on he was moved into a cell accompanied with other POWs who had been captured in Laos. <br /> <br />One of the things I liked the most with this book was that it had a happy ending. When Brace arrived home he once again proved that he was a survivor. He managed to survive freedom. The homecoming was a shock to him, since his wife had remarried and despite knowing differently, told the children their father was dead. Ernest C. Brace gives a lot of praise to his second wife, Nancy. She came into his life while he was still in hospital. His younger children moved in with them, and Ernest Brace got a new job and a career.  <br /> <br />Ernest Brace ends his book in 2001 by telling us that he retired in 1993, and there is a photo of him together with M. and Raisa Gorbachev taken the same year. He tells that it was taken when he was asked to accompany the Russian couple on a trip from Washington D.C. to San Francisco.  <br /> <br />Ernest Brace is a man who survived against the odds. This is a captivating book that makes you sit down and think long after you have finished it.   <br />	2005-02-28

The book about Yolande Mukagasana kept me indoors most of the day: I just couldn't put the book down, and finished it yesterday. Her story was that powerful. She gives a face to the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Much of her story has parallels to holocaust during World War II.    In 1994, Yolande is running her own clinic. She is married to Joseph and a mother of three. All her life she has been a victim to discrimination because she belongs to the minority tribe: She is a Tutsi, while most of her fellow citizens are Hutu. For a while Yolande has become more and more concerned about the safety of her family. She wants to leave her country, but her husband does not want to leave. He does not want their children to end up in refugee camps. The married couple discuss and argue about what will be the best for their children, and they have not been able to come to a solution when disaster strikes:    One day the President of Rwanda dies in a plane crash, and Yolande and Joseph know that all Tutsis are in serious trouble. They try to contact international and foreign organizations and embassies, but either they don't reply or they say they are sorry. Yolande and Joseph try to escape, but all ways out of their area has been blocked. They try to hide in the forest and in people's houses. Yolande experiences that people she has helped, not only refuse to help them, but also betray them. While other people who she hadn't expected any help from, risk their lives to save her.    Joseph is the first to be killed. Yolande tries to save her children: She tries to hide them, and she contacts a cousin who is of Hutu origin. Her cousin promises to look after them, and she really tries her best. Still, Yolande is not able to save her children. In the end Yolande is the only one left. Her brother had predicted that Yolande would be the only one left. He becomes right as all her sisters and herbrother dies as well. Her brother said that she would be back to bring justice for them all.     I searched the web, and I read that Yolande Mukagasana now is a nationalized Belgian citizen and she wants to testify in a planned international court.     I found the book very well written. Yolande Mukagasana's testimony is important. It is important not to forget. Yolande turns her family into real human beings and not just statistics. When whole groups of people are slaughetered, we need stories like Yolandes. These real life stories tell us that each individual whether a man, woman or child is unique and should have been protected. This knowledge is important in the struggle to prevent history to repeat itself.  I recommend this book.	2005-02-20

I have never been to Virginia in all my life, and compared to the states that are often in the media, like for instance New York, California and Florida, I knew very little about Virginia. It changed when I found this book in my mail box. It is also very obvious that besides being an excellent cook, Rowena Fullinwider is very proud of her state and wants to share it with the rest of us. <br /> <br />The reason I have given Celebrate Virginia! only 4 stars (closer to 4 1/2 really), is that I found it a bit hard to read a lot of the middle sections.

This was something I hadn't heard much about before, and I thought it was nice to read about her family and friends, and not the least about how she met her husband George Bush. There was so much I didn't know, and the pages turned quickly. <br />I also enjoyed the end of the book. It was great to learn more about how she experienced the Gulf War and, in the end, the loss in the final president election that her husband was a part of. In this part, I found what I felt was missing in the middle part of the book: I felt she was more open about what she thought about people and situations than she was when it came to the Vice President and President years. It's natural to think that she couldn't be so open about what she thought about political leaders and situations during that period. I find that understandable, but it made this part of 'A Memoir' duller to read than the rest of book.<br />Even so, I liked Barbara Bush, because she seemed like a nice lady.	2004-02-06

Jim Thompson survives nine years of captivity. He is tortured and starved. When another prisoner meets him some years into Jim's captivity, this other man describes him as 'a skeleton with some white hair on top'. Nobody believes that Jim is going to survive. But, what they do not know of is Jim's strong determination to stay alive. He dreams a lot of his wife and his four children. Needless to say: Jim's homecoming is a shock. His wife has lived with another man, and the children have been told that their father is dead. His wife, Alyce, has been very keen to keep her husband's name off all official lists, while she at the same time has received his pay checks.<br />It is obvious that Alyce in many ways, behaved in a way that she should not be proud of, but at the same time, the strength of this book is that it gives her a chance to tell her side of the story.<br />When I read the book, Alyce never became my heroine, but still, I do see that her life was not easy: The way she was treated in 1964, when her husband was a POW, and she was alone with four children, was down right cruel. But, her solutions to the problem, were not very good. And, when Jim came back, her handling of this situation is not very good either. In many ways, Alyce does not come out as a very strong person, and the advice she received, was not the best all the time. Their four children's stories are heartbreaking. So, this is a sad story of how a family was affected by the Vietnam War.	2003-11-03

Others have claimed that it was not King Richard III, but King Henry VII, who killed King Edward IV's two heirs.<br /><br />History tells us that Edward IV and his Queen, Elizabeth Woodville, had many children, and among them were two boys. When King Edward died, his brother, Prince Richard, offered to take care of his young nephews. Their mother felt<br />that she had to agree. Later on, Richard had them declared illegitimate, before the children disappeared.<br /><br />Richard was king between 1483-85. He died in a battle with Henry Tudor, who became the new king.

The author tells us about all fifteen, and portrays some of them, for instance King William, in a more positive way than in the case of other books. Van der Kiste claims that King William was positive for British politics. At the same time, we are told that he was a very good father to his ten children born out of wedlock. And van der Kiste claims that his younger brother, the Duke of Cumberland, was not a murderer. This also contradicts versions I have read before. The author tells us that most of King George's fifteen children had their flaws, but at the same time they had their good sides. In this way I do believe that van der Kiste gives us a more balanced view than many other authors.<br />As for the King's many daughters, I must say that I really feel sorry for them. They had to stay with their possessive parents, and none of them were allowed to marry until they were old. They were expected to obey their parents, and seemed to have had rather boring and restricted lives.<br />I agree with some of the the critics that it is often confusing to keep track of who is who, as the author keeps switching between their christian names and their titles. When there were so many of them, it is hard to remember what son or daughter had which title. But, all in all, this is quite a good book.	2003-03-27

It was a good book, because it has a good structure and an interesting build up until the end.<br />It was interesting that the victim, Annie, had tourette's syndrome. Walters writes about Annie's struggles, as she deals with her problems. Sadly, Annie is badly treated by cruel people that live in her neighbourhood. Very few people try to help her, because they do not understand why she behaves as she does,and because they want to keep out of trouble. Annie also suffers because she is the only black person who lives in the neighbourhood.<br />20 years later, one neighbour tries to find out what really happened to Annie the day she was murdered.	2003-03-06

I did not know much about the Plantagenet era before I read this book. It all seemed like a messy period that was plagued by wars and murders. This book made it easier to understand what happened between 1154 and 1485. A family tree in the beginning of the the book makes it easier to find out who is related to who.<br />Some very famous people were among the members of the Plantagenet family: I guess, most people remember Richard Lionheart and John Lackland from the saga of 'Robin Hood' while Edward I and Edward II were portrayed in Mel Gibson's film 'Braveheart'. (I realize that not everything in 'Robin Hood' and 'Braveheart' is correct.)<br />Other famous members of the Plantagenet dynasty were Richard III who many believe murdered his two young nephews, Henry V who had to struggle with Joan of Arc, and Edward, the Black Prince who is mentioned in 'A Knight's Tale'. You can read about all these people as well as many others in this book. There is also information about places and issues that were important during this era of time. I found it interesting to read about how the Jews were treated by the Plantagenet kings. Other interesting topics were the Crusades, Egypt, Joan of Arc and Margaret, the Maid of Norway.<br />I highly recommend this book. It is informative, has a good structure and it is easy to read. The many drawings and photographs make it even more interesting.	2002-11-14

En av mine hovedinteresser er engelsk konge-historie, og f skriver s godt om dette emnet som Richard Herrmann. Denne boka om Stuart-dynastiet er enda et eksempel p forfatterens store fortellerkunst.

Richard Herrmanns bok om Tudor-dynastiet er meget interessant. I denne boka lærer vi om de som styrte England gjennom en av de viktigte periodene i britisk historie. Og for noen mennesker Herrmann beskriver:<BR>Henry VII ble den første Tudor-kongen etter han hadde drept onkelen til kona si i et avgjørende slag. Onkelen het Richard III, og han hadde i sin tid blitt konge etter drapet på hans to unge nevøer. Richard III skulle passe på dem, men det endte med at han mest sannsynlig drepte dem. Nå ble han imidlertid selv satt til side av ektemannen til sin niese.<br />Neste mann ut var Henry VIII. Han er mest berømt fordi han giftet seg seks ganger: To hustruer ble henrettet, to skilte han seg i fra, ei døde i barselseng, mens ei overlevde han. Henry VIIIs store sorg var at det ble bare tre barn ut av alle disse ekteskapene. Alle disse tre ble i tur og orden regenter, men ingen av dem fikk barn. Tudor-dynastiet døde derfor ut med den siste og kanskje største av dem alle; Dronning Elizabeth I.<br />Richard Herrmann beskriver denne slekten på en levende og fengende måte. Til tross for at boka er preget av en stor detaljkunnskap fra forfatteren sin side, er boka lettlest, og best av alt: Den blir aldri kjedelig.	2002-11-06

I bought this book many years ago, and I still pick it up at least once a month.

I found it facinating to read about another two members of the Tudor family. Maybe the most interesting thing about the Tudor family is how they managed to rule, or simply survive, in a time when cruelty, power struggles and dominance over women were common.<br />In this book Maria Perry tells us about the sisters' childhood and family background, as well as about their adult lives. In both cases the sisters had to marry a king as part of their father's attempt to keep or make allies, and not for love.<br />The eldest sister Margaret soon ended up as my favourite. She came across as a strong and couragious woman. In a time when women had no power, she fought to take control over her own life. When she was widowed and still pregnant, her brother tried to arrange a wedding for her. But Margaret wanted to marry based on her own choice, something her brother Henry VIII disliked. Later on she had to fight in order to keep her children, since they as heirs to the throne could be used as tools to rule the country by scroupulous men.	2002-08-22

Michael Scott Speicher Story	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A shocking story	This book tells the story of missing airman Scott Speicher. The author believes that the pilot is alive in Iraqi captivity, and in her own way she takes us behind closed doors. <br />What happened to Speicher? Based on facts obtained in her own studies, she gives us her opinion about what happened and is still going on. She indicates that certain US officials are as much to blame as Saddam Hussein for Speicher's plight, and that is frightening.<br />At the same time it is interesting to learn how Speicher's family and friends reacted to his disapearance. It is touching to read fragments from Scott's last letter to his wife; the letter he had left behind in case something should happen to him. At the same time his friends' desciptions of him as a 'good man' really make you wish that he's alive and soon will be able to come home to a better life.<br />I find the last chapter especially shocking. It made me lie awake and think long after I should have been asleep.	2002-07-26
