This book talks about why.<br />It's hard for a liberal to give a liberal 3 stars, but!  There's a parade of Bush quotes and Miller's attempt to explain most of them in terms of Freudian slips.  This becomes tiresome, and of course, when it comes to Bush there's always the suspicion that they are merely stupid slips and not Freudian ones.  When, for instance, he uses the word &quot;commiserate&quot; instead of &quot;commensurate&quot;, you just know he's barely aware of either word's definition.  The quote section is sandwiched between lengthy diatribes wherein Miller shows us he's a bit too rabid to be helpful (don't preach to the choir, guy, reach out to the other side!).  And it's obviously time to get ready for 2004, but Miller has no suggestions.<br />Miller's at his best when he's exposing TV as the willing accomplice of the Right.  Sounded correct to me anyway, especially his fingering of Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.  When points start getting too profound, they reach for the trivial.<br />Lucky us.	2001-10-11

The story takes forever to pick up -- like about three-quarters of the way through -- but when it does it becomes a good ride -- and a good read.  And Higgins does an awful job of cleaning up after himself at the end (not to ruin it, but what happens to all the real estate?).  Oh, well.  Made the miles pass by in its Recorded Books incarnation.  There's lots of better Higgins out there.	2001-09-05

Unfortunately, they're all told in the third person and so aren't nearly as charming.  And the experiences of Bech in Communist Europe have little resonance to our time and are not terribly profound.  Perhaps the later Bech output is better.  This one though is a disappointment.  Three stars, of course, because Updike can only be so bad...	2001-09-05

(At 15 packed CDs, not much time left to hear anything else, believe me!)  Mr. Guidall does everything he can to make this book come to life.  He's a real pro.  But something this long should have had some kind of point to it, or at least an interesting ending.  There's lots of biological and genetic techno talk that you won't need to understand, and weaved around that a pretty pedestrian plot, full of give-aways &#8211; Bear stealing his own thunder (you as a reader are way ahead of the characters most of the time, which is absurd and makes you feel silly).  By doing childbirth, perhaps Bear decided to go for both the largely male techno audience and the romance ... audience simultaneously.  Who knows?  Who cares?  Oh, and did I mention it was unconscionably long?  If you insist on experiencing this novel, may I recommend it in an abridged form?  You won't miss a thing.	2001-07-18

Naturally, as one who had already read a ton of Updike (but not this volume), I was intrigued.  And I was glad when I finally did read it, for it turns out to be a deliciously lyrical description of how a small group of married people in a coastal town engage in extramarital sex and other forms of innocent seeming behavior and how it all blows up in their faces &#8211; quietly, oh so quietly.  Updike is testing the ice for us (indeed, one section is named &#8220;Thin Ice&#8221;).  He is helping us judge the New Morality.  Will it work, or does it simply displace a more established code of sexual ethics for a while, then vanish? Thirty-five odd years later, the Pill and other forms of birth control have still failed to make marriage obsolete; &#8220;wife-swapping&#8221; is still not widely practiced.  So perhaps Updike was on to something here (namely, that marital fidelity has its place in our scheme of things).  The famous graphic sex this novel is supposed to contain?  Well, it&#8217;s pretty tame stuff these days, but the directness of the sexual descriptions is still delightfully scintillating and refreshing.  The best thing about the book though is its characters&#8217; dialog.  Updike wouldn&#8217;t know how to fill a page with bland verbiage if he tried, and this book is no exception.  But unlike the &#8220;Rabbit&#8221; novels, these characters are always making exotic observations, expressing themselves in a surprising, distinctive, and endlessly entertaining manner.  ... Still a terrific read, however (and you may always disagree with me about the ending!).	2001-07-09

The final chapter of the first half is the oft-anthologized short story &quot;Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend,&quot; an exquisite tale of how the permanently befuddled old man befriends a young lass from London who is summering in the countryside, and together the two of them set the world straight.  In fact, that's just what the Emsworth stories are always about:  People thrown together, each having his/her own set of priorities, and how they get what they want by practicing &quot;You scratch my back, I scratch yours.&quot;  Communicating over the din of one another's priorities is a constant source of humor, the unexpected combination of actions and outcomes is another, and the whole reveals Wodehouse's virtuosic gift for storytelling.  The Emsworth stories are hard to beat.<br />Not so the Mulliner stories that make up the second half of the book (3 stars).  Here we have a set of stories with improbable plots about Hollywood in the early talkies days.  They rely too much on myths about tons of money floating around Hollywod and the incompetent people who wield all this wealth.  Though they were probably pretty well received when they first came out, by a na√Øve public newly fascinated with Hollywood, they are now rather dated and sometimes too silly to be funny.  Plus, Wodehouse shares with Shute and Waugh that singular inability of many an English writer to capture and replicate American-ese.  Well, they are not horrible stories; simply relatively uninteresting.  You can stop with the last Emsworth story in this book and not miss a thing, which is what I recommend.	2001-04-04

On the other hand, when someone blandly points out that European influences in Africa destroyed a way of life that perhaps didn't need to be destroyed, you will know from reading this book precisely what that way of life was like.  It's a sort of African \\"Gone With the Wind.\\"  Achebe makes no judgments; he simply tells what happened.  And he leaves it to you, the reader, to supply your own sense of devastation.  I just wish we could have been treated to a little more plot in the first four-fifths of the book.  A lot of kids are assigned this book in high school, and I can see why they go stir-crazy trying to sit still and read it.  That they are eventually rewarded by a brilliant ending must be, for them, scant recompense for their toils.	2001-03-28

But if it were only that, it would be pretty boring.  Luckily, in telling the intertwining tales of the people who fell with the bridge on that fateful day, Wilder shows an exquisite delicacy of touch, very close to poetic, and a fine sense of where to elaborate in a story and where to simply summarize (would that many of our best authors today show that sense and not just churn out the pages).  Also remarkable is Wilder's ability to be evocative.  One gets a real sense of Lima, Peru, in the early 18th Century, the clear mornings, the quiet nights, and without all the unattractive bedbugs of an author like Saramago.<br />No matter what your predilection is for fiction, you will not fail to be touched by \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey.\\"	2001-03-18

The descriptions of decaying Venice (CA) were more pedestrian than evocative, and I had to supply a lot of imagination to flesh out the mental picture I was supposed to be getting.  The plot was also not particularly distinctive.  By far the most interesting moments came when I briefly suspected one of the major characters, but when the real perpetrator was discovered it seemed too pat.  Considering some of the fine work being done these days in mystery writing (especially by those who, like Bradbury, don't do it exclusively), this is a minor opus indeed.	2001-03-14

Reagan liked to take a small selection of what for him amounted to fact and build a conservative argument around it.  Sometimes it's convincing, sometimes it's less so, but nearly always it's pretty boring stuff.  Reagan's genius was his simple vision of what America could be if it stopped apologizing for itself.  The way he energized his staff to that end when he became President is the real story of his uniqueness (George Shultz' Foreword is perhaps more illuminating in this respect).  The material in this book does little to advance our understanding of that uniqueness.  And of course wading through the crossed-out prose and the bad spellings merely becomes tedious after awhile.  It might be excellent for Reagan groupies or serious historians, but it is hardly great reading fare for the rest of us.	2001-03-05

Poe's only novel reminded me of Gogol's \\"Dead Souls,\\" in that, in both, the story seems to take a weird turn toward the end and shuts down rather oddly.  Gogol's excuse is that he became a fire-breathing convert to Christianity midway through writing his book, and so had no use for the book's initial cynical tone (instead we get a character rant on in socio-religious mode for awhile).  I don't know what Poe's excuse is, but the effect of his end-of-story turn is remarkable, and I won't spoil it for you (unlike other reviewers below - warning!).  There is a vivid, dreamlike, unsettling quality to the whole book, and (with the exception of a few dull pages of sailing life detail - not unlike \\"Moby Dick,\\" but with nowhere near as much page-filling excess) there is rip-roaring action from start to finish.  Poe's yarn is full of incident, and every bit of it counts.  So at midnight, lock the door, sit back, put your feet up, and soak up this book in the dim light of your hurricane lamp. It's, after all, one of many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore!	2001-02-28

Robert Shaw (HMB206)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The Bully Pulpit for Artistic Excellence	People who think Robert Shaw was something special and who come across this book will be delighted with its readability.  While it certainly captures Shaw's unique ability to command your respect and warm your heart, it is especially successful in putting the phenomenon that was Shaw into the context of music in America in the Twentieth Century.  One often doesn't think much about what it must have been like, especially in the earlier part of the era, to champion and perform the &quot;modern&quot; serious music repertoire; this book forces us to think about it, to put ourselves in the places of those who felt, like Shaw, compelled to do it.  Along the way, there's a good overview of the evolution of recording, and how Shaw fit in there, not so much exploiting the medium as using it to serve the larger purpose of his art.  Compelled throughout his career to make popular recordings, Shaw's final one for RCA (&quot;Irish Songs,&quot; August `67) is in fact finished by a capable associate while he runs off to do more important things with his latest love, the Atlanta Symphony.  The &quot;popular&quot; Shaw was to always dog the &quot;artistic&quot; Shaw throughout his career.  He was once stung by a critic who said of his light encores, &quot;They drew lots of applause mingled with the soft plash of the cognoscenti being quietly sick in their hats.&quot;<br />Everyone will have their favorite quote from Shaw after reading this book.  Mine is a long, affectionately comic poem on Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which concludes, &quot;So, grieve not, Gus!  Our new Apollo! // Where you lead us, we will wallow!&quot;  Indeed, the many quotes from Shaw as he speaks and writes to his choruses are the principal glories of this book.<br />But always, always the music.  You can feel the march of performances as they are roll-called before your eyes.  This may not be the most authoritative, most definitive book on Shaw possible, but it is the one I wanted most to read.  A real five starrecommendation, and no apologies to the cognoscenti!	2001-02-18

He talked with them personally.  He helped leader and cornetist Nick LaRocca dig through his garage-ful of documents and memorabilia.  He got the whole story of the band - where it played, how it made the first ever recordings of jazz, when it broke up, when it got back together, influences, how it developed its distinctive sound.  He got the whole story - almost.  Sadly, he chose not to address the very thing that is now so troubling about the ODJB:  LaRocca's nasty comments about blacks.  You could finish this book and not know a thing about those comments.  It is another story to be told, I guess, and would probably take another book to tell well.  But it must be told.  It is a sad story, for LaRocca chooses to believe that blacks had no part in the creation or the development of jazz.  And Brunn, the apologist, apparently is only too happy to buy into that myth, describing the band in the end as \\"the five pioneers who brought into existence the most phenomenal revolution in the annals of American music.\\"  This book will never be the final word on the ODJB, but will always be a great resource for those hungry for information from that period in our nation's musical history.  And it is a great, evocative, easy read.	2001-02-10
US	52993157	REL6IKK1K9IYL	0807825565	777865639	Princes of Ireland, Planters of Maryland: A Carroll Saga, 1500-1782 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press)	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Rigorous Analysis Yields Engaging View of Colonial Life	I was originally attracted to this book out of a simple curiosity about the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence (Charles Carroll outlived Adams and Jefferson by about six years, or about 56 years after 1776!).  On a deeper level, I hoped to learn more about the kind of early capitalist that would be attracted to signing on to the American Revolution in general.  What this book helped me discover was a family that had over time become focused, almost obsessed, with making a buck under fairly adverse circumstances (namely, continuing in their Roman Catholic faith that made it difficult for them to thrive, even in an enclave as seemingly sympathetic as colonial Maryland, with its relatively large Catholic population).  But when the time came for this family to rise above its simple wealth building and to champion the cause of the Revolution, it did indeed rise to the occasion, however brief and painful the process might be.  (Hoffman attends to both the private and public lives of the Carrolls.)  The history of the Carrolls is a part of the history of the magic that was the American Revolution. It is not surprising that the book ends abruptly with the death of Charles Carroll's father and his wife, about 10 days apart from one another in 1782 (though there is a brief summing up of Carroll's remaining 50 years and the attention attracted by his death in 1832).  The story is told, the dynasty pretty much complete.<br />What's the book like?  At times it seems downright willfully prosaic, and the story proceeds much like a carefully written doctoral dissertation - all conclusions fully supported and made in as logical a context as possible, all contentions politically correct for our time.  Hoffman's goal is of course to be scholarly and thorough, not to be entertaining or controversial.  Thus the sweep of this history must emerge and coalesce in the mind of the reader.  Leave being beaten over the head with the broader conclusions inherent in the narrative to more popularly written histories.<br />Suffice it to say, if you're a municipal library and you need to beef up your Revolutionary War material, this is a prime buy.  If you're a true history buff, this would be an excellent choice to work into your reading list. It has the effect of immersing you into the spirit of the times and providing you with detail you could not have imagined you would find interesting (but you do).  If you're a casual reader, just be advised - this is heavy stuff.  It's not an easy read, but it is ultimately a rewarding one.	2001-01-25

We readers spent a lot of time in the four Rabbit books being exasperated, if not saddened, by Nelson, Rabbit's unfortunate, screwed-up son.  Well, here, finally, Nelson comes into his own.  He has hit his stride.  We readers become - dare I say it? - downright proud of him.  And how is Rabbit remembered?  You need only observe his children, in whom he lives on.  (Check out the last word and re-read the question it answers.  Hmmm...)  Also, you don't need to read the first four Rabbit books to enjoy or understand this story; it's satisfying on its own - cinema verite in book form.<br />The other stories are not terribly memorable or compelling.  Nevertheless they fit just like a comfortable old pair of shoes.  One wonders if they might not be simply necessary, a chance for Updike to work through the late-arriving gremlins of his own memory.  If you want to read only one or two of these stories, I'd recommend \\"Natural Color\\" very highly for its great insights and the title track, \\"Licks of Love in the Heart of the Cold War,\\" as a better-than-average plot.  Mr. Bech also makes an appearance (\\"His Oeuvre\\"), and the excerpts from his (Bech's) writings are as diverting to read as ever, as is the sad conclusion he makes at the end of the story.	2001-01-04

This collection of short stories begins with one about the title character, Lord Emsworth, a constantly befuddled old man who only wants to putter away his time if only his energetic relatives would let him.  Though not my favorite Emsworth saga, this one is excellently written and endlessly hilarious.  All the other stories are similarly well done, but they all begin to meld together somehow.  I would have preferred more variety in the approach.  If you read this (and you should!), I recommend one story at a time, and allow some good space between stories.  Use an episode perhaps as a palate cleanser between each of those long lugubrious novels you insist on reading.  That way you'll get the max out of the book, and every story will remain distinctive.	2000-11-21

The kind the older generation uses for birthdays and farewell luncheons (\\"We hope that God will bless// You with good health and happiness!\\").  You hate it, the forced rhymes and imperfect metrical structure (indeed, what metrical structure?).  My mother-in-law used to write like that - volumes and volumes of such tripe.  Sadly, she has departed from us, but not before leaving tons of this stuff all over the house, and a half-finished vanity press run of 100 copies (anybody want one?).<br />Now I know where she got the impetus for such poetry - Lord Byron!  All of that generation's worst excesses of bad poetry come from Byron, I think.  Embarrassingly forced rhymes, self-conscious commentary that frustratingly impedes the flow of the narrative, arch cuteness that threatens one's sanity - all there!!  And he couldn't even finish it off properly.<br />Truly, a work only an academic could love - or find any value in.  If you are attracted to this book, protect yourself:  Try reading it aloud and making a stop at the end of every line (sing-song-like) so you can at least get the sense of the rhymes.  I found the Penguin edition serviceable (as Penguins usually are).  And don't bother with the footnotes, just let it flow.  Now stop being so hard on the older generation.	2000-11-09

What do you already know to be true that you are ignoring?  That the important things are not money or busy-ness.  The important things are love and appreciation of the world around us.  It's just that Albom's (and Morrie's)  prose is dull and artless.  It doesn't soar, it doesn't sing.  I wanted more from a book about a dying man's view of life.  And I definitely wanted something new to hear.  Well, this is a good book, and perhaps more people ought to read it, just as it is.  If you're undecided about buying the book vs. the tape version, here's a tip:  At the end of the tape, the producers have given us a generous sampling of excerpts from the tape recordings Albom made while with Morrie.

But who says we can't love a person while they are still with us, and why can't we bother ourselves to appreciate our differences and to address them in a kindly and loving way before the end of our time together?  Mr. Waugh, I think, says all this in &quot;The Loved One,&quot; but in a much more entertaining fashion.  Indeed, you won't even realize it till you're done enjoying the book.

Mr. Eszterhas' take on Monicagate is that it shows us how  hung up we are on sex in this country, and we are not always willing to  admit it, but in our heart of hearts...  Thus in politics, as in the film  industry, it's all about sex.  So why only three stars?  Because Mr.  Eszterhas squanders a great opportunity to draw some conclusions from the  400-page mass of evidence he presents.

Well, three stars just because it's a  good experience, refreshing to hear that there was once an America where a  vaudeville comedy duo could travel together for a long period of time and  not have sex together until they were married.  The interpolated material  from old radio broadcasts is welcome, but sometimes there are extensive  musical excerpts that lead nowhere.  Such filler I can live without.

The narrator seemingly unconsciously repeats many facts  about the extrovert's character, and that is more maddening than endearing.   It's Bellow, of course, so there are many fine Kodak moments, but overall  this book is a disappointment, with little plot to speak of, not as good as  \\"The Actual,\\" or even \\"The Dean's December\\" (but still better than a ton of  books out there).  One of the stars I'm giving it is just for the final  radiant pages.  Would that the rest of the book were as striking.	2000-08-13

This work shouldn't have either.  It should come out just as it did originally from Jack's typewriter - as  one long scream.  But what gets this book only three stars is the fact that  the main character, Dean Moriarty, is neither particularly likable nor  particularly funny.  To put up with that for the entire length of a book  takes a lot of patience.  Good luck.  There is an interesting sidelight,  and that is the juxtaposition of cool and hot, the characters of Sal  Paradise (the narrator) and Dean.  They are like Miles Davis and Charlie  Parker, an unsettling union indeed.  The book IS a good journey into the  Zeitgeist of the Beatnik Age.  What's the better Kerouac referred to in my  headline?

Good research, plausible tight dialogue, sensible plotting, it's all there.  But it loses a star because I wanted it to go  further and it didn't.  Specifically, it didn't take me into an area of  thought that would have surprised me.  So what it is is a fine successful  exercise by a master storyteller and accomplished writer, a good warm-up  for students and all those new to \\"Hamlet.\\"  One motif that could have been  carried further:  the epoch motif.  Updike shows how the story is informed  by past (the myths, the violence of pre-gunpowder war), present (the  medieval European social and political structure and the role of the  church), and future (the humanism being taught in the universities at the  time).  I would have liked to have seen more of how these epochs play off  against each other in the story, but it seems Updike wasn't as interested  as I was in this aspect of the play that he himself introduced.	2000-07-07

Who else could have a drunk misfire the starting pistol at a boy's school's  games, have the bullet hit a poor kid's foot, cause the kind of damage that  necessitates the removal of the foot, and still have us smiling at the  audaciousness of it all?  So don't worry, this slim little volume is a full  meal, and a very satisfying one.  Waugh is also economical - characters  regularly return for yet another go at having an effect upon the fate of  the main character (reminiscent of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;).  T.S. Eliot  lovers will also have a pleasant surprise waiting for them:  Toward the end  of the book, Waugh has a character explaining the meaning of life that  sounds suspiciously like a passage from Eliot's &quot;Four Quartets.&quot;   But you don't have to know that, or anything else really, to get great  pleasure from reading &quot;Decline and Fall.&quot;  Make it your next  book.	2000-06-14

It's just hard to understand why Wilder  wrote it.  There is so little of it in the way of dramatic or comic  invention.  The protagonist is a bodhisatva (a saint on earth) who spends  his days doing good.  All the time.  You keep expecting some rising action  - after 100 pages you yearn for it - but it never comes.  Just one good  deed after another.  It isn't a bad read, and it might even be a good thing  to put into the hands of teenagers (if you can get them to sit still for  it).  But there's no inner struggle going on in this first person  narrative.  And that makes ultimately for a weak plot.  The book was  something of a hit when it first came out, but it has since sunk to the  obscurity it probably deserves.  That saddens me, because I thought the  author's &quot;Our Town&quot; and &quot;Skin of Our Teeth&quot; to be some  of the finest writing this side of Heaven.	2000-05-22

We don't meet a slime-bag this putrid till we meet the hero of Henry Miller's  &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; many years later.  We get used to watching  this anti-hero sink ever lower:  Just when we think he has hit rock-bottom  in manners and charity, he performs a deed or says a word that can only  sink him lower in our estimation.  As he comments on his story, we  understand he is attempting to fight hypocrisy, but he perverts every  attempt by filling it with self-loathing so that the fight against  hypocrisy gets swallowed up in his self-destruction.  Fun stuff?  Hardly.   But it is breathtaking to behold.	2000-05-19

Never wanting to have been born into the lower class, Julien has a constant dialog with himself about the ulterior  motives of the people he meets and deals with.  Sometimes his observations  are penetrating, other times they are laughable.  But he is always  thinking, thinking, thinking.  And of course as we learn to think like  Julien, we begin to see the world for what it is - filled with role-playing  tricksters, some of them more sincere at times than others.  A sobering  account of our world for, even if we think the modern world is not so class  conscious, it is still filled with the same tricks and games.  Those who  play it best win.  Julien is not so lucky to extricate himself from the  corner he has painted himself in; we may be luckier.  A cautionary tale.   Don't get so caught up in your &quot;game&quot; that you can't recognize it  for what it is and be able to leave it at will.	2000-05-19

Here's the answer:  The brain somewhat tires of the conundrums that are placed  before it during the first two thirds, so it's hard to capture all the  fierce eloquence of the final third in one sitting.  But, boy, does that  ever come across in living color when you read it.  You can actually stare  at a line for awhile and savor it and not miss the next ten lines in the  process.  There is a lot to like in this play, and much of it is Beyond  Clever.  Also, this is one book you will read more than once, even if you  don't routinely do that with your books.

Shares with many other novels the preposterous notion that some Nazis were humane and thoughtful (I'm thinking of  Steinbeck's &quot;The Moon is Down&quot; for one), but I don't hold that  against the work.  We would all do exactly the same things the old man did  to save the children, so there develops a great sympathy for him during the  course of the reading.  And the book is squeaky clean, one that provides  some welcome relief from the current onslaught of, say, two females having  sex in the toilet stall in &quot;Bright Lights, Big City.&quot;  We're way  far away from that here.

But the whole thing hinges on the humanity of the invading soldiers - without that there's no meaning.  And we all know about  how human most Nazis were in their dealings with conquered people.  So  we're left with the sad sense of everyone taking their place on the Wheel  of Life and playing their roles until death do us part.  That is, it might  have been more meaningful had the Nazi characters actually broken the mold  big-time and translated some of their humanity into concrete actions useful  to the populace instead of reverting to form and attempting half-heartedly  the few stillborn sympathetic actions they did attempt.  Nevertheless, the  novel is tight, with Steinbeck not yielding to the temptation of playing  out some of the more obvious scenes.  You won't be bored and you won't be  disappointed.	2000-03-04

In fact it gets bogged down rather too often in discussions about how ironically we conduct our lives and what would be the intelligent alternative.  But it is a fine achievement nonetheless and a good  cautionary tale about people taking themselves and their lives way too  seriously.  The depiction of family life reminded me of Satykov-Schedrin's  \\"The Family Golovlyov,\\" that savage recounting of the ultimate  dysfunctional family:  Some of Butler's exposing of each family member's  real agenda is a supreme hoot, and very perceptive indeed.  Please know too  that \\"The Way of All Flesh,\\" published in 1903, is an acknowledged  precursor to much of our greatest Twentieth Century literature.  George  Bernard Shaw has admitted his debt, but I also wonder how James Joyce must  have been affected, and many, many others.  But for us, as we begin the  Twenty-First Century, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is at least a delicious book  to savor and to open our eyes.	2000-02-12

Nowadays, historians want to prevaricate you to death with all the fine points they can dredge up.  Here's an author who sticks to his single point throughout, that President  Cleveland's innate honesty was not enough to serve America and that he  should have tried to alter his stances at times to suit America's needs.   As we say nowadays, Cleveland needed a paradigm shift big time.  Tugwell's  style is both lively and direct, sometimes a little like a good high school  sourcebook in how it anxiously seeks to explain even the most basic points  in completely understandable terms.  If you're looking for a good first  book to read on Cleveland, this is it.  There is a curious resonance with  the present too:  Sometimes the Cleveland story is a bit like the Clinton  story; at other times it's a bit like the George W. Bush story.  See for  yourself.	1999-12-15

Papa must've been the cleanest damn white hunter ever.   If you're looking for economical writing, dis ain't da place.  The most  telling sentence in the book occurs when Pat Hemingway quotes his father:   \\"We're just sitting cross-legged in a bazaar, and if people aren't  interested in what we're saying, they'll go away.\\"  The book should have  been titled \\"Cross-legged in a Bazaar,\\" and that quote should have been on  the quote page.  You've been warned.  But if you stay along for the ride  you'll get some fairly typical \\"African\\" Hemingway.  Oh, the disquiet of  the marriage is not so well articulated as in \\"Garden of Eden,\\" and the  only threat of something violent happening (a Mau Mau insurrection)  dissolves early on.  The book delivers many incredibly boring conversations  (even for posthumous Hemingway) in their entirety, and the author's now  famous male chauvinism remains largely intact (and as thoroughly annoying  as ever) throughout the text.  Funniest thing is Papa now attributing to  himself a number of enthusiastic \\"That's wonderful, darling!\\" comments,  right out of effeminate British romance films of the Forties.  Say what?   There are some distinctive descriptive passages, but is it worth the trip?   For me, to read some new Hemingway at the end of the century he helped  define was reason enough.  But it may not be for you.	1999-12-03

Oh, once in a while you'd  get a whiff of profundity, but it was really just off-the-wall silliness  most of the time.  Well, that's what this book is - no ground-breaking tome  about The Necessity of Comedy or Humans Adapting to Space, just a pleasant  diversion for a quick read.  I will grant you that this is no perceptive  Douglas Adams futurism - Mr. Idle doesn't kill himself trying to excise the  anachronisms - and I will grant you that this is one of the slowest  starting books I've read in a long time.  But to trash it wholesale, well,  that's just going overboard.  Save your pans for books that truly deserve  them (\\"Bridges of Madison County\\" or \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" for instance).

Endlessly imitated, never duplicated, Miller's \\"classic\\" resists being for  the many.  The self-absorbed protagonist, a horrid little man (-- Can you  hear Maggie Smith saying that? --) spends his life descending into the  maelstrom of his existence to hone his own sense of nihilism.  As his  unwitting and unwilling observer, I was not thrilled (titillated?  Don't  make me laugh).  But, hey, if you like this stuff...  Tell you what:  Read  the first three pages.

Vidal tackles Big Physics, but gets immediately lazy and is unable and/or  unwilling to flesh out the math and the scientific concepts.  So we're left  with a hodge-podge of famous characters, past presidents mostly, who behave  arbitrarily and a plot that turns arbitrarily.  What's the point?  I don't  know - \\"life's a silly game\\" maybe?  This could have been an excellent book  to give to your teenage son (if for no other reason than that it shows a  kid doing something other than staring dumbly at his computer) but the  graphic sex is probably something most parents wouldn't feel comfortable  passing on to their \\"impressionable\\" offspring.	1999-09-11

But whereas Thurber takes minute incidents and  magnifies them into comic epic sagas, Fry takes his more significant  moments and de-mystifies them.  There are plenty of digressions along the  way, and since Fry's life story is hardly singular, we are grateful for the  digressions.  Among my favorites are the great sensible discussions about  the nature of the homosexual psyche and Fry's self-wonderment over his own  criminal proclivities.  My guess is, at the end of the book most readers  probably utter an \\"Ah!\\" the same way Fry uttered it after he is caught for  the last time, but ours is the satisfied \\"Ah!\\" of knowing that we've just  spent some time in the presence of a uniquely entertaining personality.	1999-09-04

Well, a great  pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it  wouldn't be the work that it is.  But suffice to say, when it all comes  together properly it can blow you away.  My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and  Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw  intellectual and psychic power.  Like the epic upon which it is based,  \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the  nature of the marital relationship.  The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\"  the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife  faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a  conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to  continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation.   Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't  try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy.

It is a hopeless affair which must prove  ultimately sterile given the society that produced it.  What Wharton  doesn't do is as interesting as what she does do.  She isn't judgmental  about the social structure, she avoids making the poverty so severe that it  gets in the way of the story, and she doesn't confuse poverty with dullness  and so make any of her main characters unable to be sufficiently  articulate.  Like Nevil Shute in &quot;The Far Country,&quot; Wharton is  gifted at making each sentence of dialog shine, each look, each touch, the  weather, the cat.  Everything is so genuine, it springs from the page.  The  result is (like Shute's) a romance novel you actually care about.  It's  great American art.  One note:  There are a lot of student reviews below  mine.  Just remember, if a kid resents having to read a book, that kid will  give the book a bad review as a way of getting back at his/her teacher.

What could I, a 50-year-old white male, an embittered battle-weary liberal, get out of it?   Well... plenty actually.  For one thing, the kid really is cute and  precocious, and her lines are always remarkably apt, like Alice's.  And all  the other characters are similarly convincingly drawn.  The seeming  childishness of many of the incidents always have a deeper level of  meaning.  But mainly, the stunning matter-of-factness of the trial of the  Negro and its foregone conclusion, and how life had no choice but to go on  (to do anything else would be life-denying) reached deep into my heart and  made its certain mark on my soul.  Not all books have to exhibit the  densities of a Saul Bellow or a John Barth tome.  Some books can be quite  simple and still succeed magnificently.  This book is one of them.

But the humanity of  Foote's vision is the ultimately ascendant characteristic of his work.  As  Foote says elsewhere, any good, honest book about war will be anti-war.

Vonnegut's comments on everything in this world he chooses to address (including himself) always struck me as about as perceptive as could be dared without  causing widespread anarchy.  How about his assertion that, while many folks  think communism is wrong because it redistributes wealth, heck, hasn't  wealth already been redistributed by the rich???  Along those lines he  singles out Robin Hood and Jesus Christ as two of the most insidious  characters in history, neither of whom interestingly is banned from our  libraries.  He's just full of it, ain't he?  None of this has anything to  do with the ostensible plot.  But that's okay, Kurt.  Keep the one-liners  rolling.

As an adult reading a &quot;juvenile&quot; book, I was happy to see a lot of vintage Keillor in the story:  It is a humorous portrayal of frustration and impotence as one's life seems slowly to slide downhill, only to be  saved by clinging to some form of normalcy and by being loyal to one's  primal values (shades of &quot;Wobegon Boy,&quot; perhaps?).  But I began  to wonder WHO Keillor and Nilsson were writing FOR.  Kids who have parents  who are more &quot;interesting&quot; (read weird) than those kids would  like them to be?  Kids in small towns who have aspirations for something  more?  Point is, I don't think a lot of kids are going to get much out of  this book.  And the precocious kids who might are going to be reading  Evelyn Waugh or something.  Most musicians who read it will see the book's  weaknesses immediately, which also hurts the book's cause.  Bottom line for  &quot;Sandy Bottom,&quot; if you're buying this book as a gift for a kid,  fine, but just page through it at the library first and make sure it's  right for its intended receiver.	1999-04-18

Others said Conrad managed to turn a short story into a  novel.  I agree on both counts.  In the unabridged audio version, even with  as fine a reader as Frank Muller, I had to wait till tape 8 or 9 (of 11) to  begin to get into some really interesting plot, dialogue, and character  development.  The conversation between Nostromo and the doctor -- for me  the high point of the book, pereceptive and pointed -- was about tape 10.   Then the book returned to its rather unimaginative self till it limped to  its end.  Perhaps a cautionary tale for our century, written at its  beginning, about the dangers of obscene wealth and thoughtless loyalty, the  book has been superseded by many superior and more engaging tales of its  kind (like Steinbeck's &quot;Winter of our Discontent&quot;).  If you're a  patient reader who likes very quiet books, &quot;Nostromo&quot; may suit  your fancy.  Otherwise, beware.	1999-04-18

I've experienced other classics (The Aeneid, Beowulf, etc.) that turned out to be plain good reads on their own terms.  Not this  one.  It's a darling of that branch of philosophy that has to do with  logic, so there are all these careful arguments as to why things are the  way they are, all plodding and ponderous.  A book like this is not without  its moments (the &quot;morning after&quot; the trip through Hell, the fact  that Beatrice was not able to smile at Dante for fear of overwhelming him,  etc.), but it does drag on for the most part.  Try to find a translation  that is clear and informal.  The Blackstone Audio's translator (not  identified!) retained the thee's and thou's and the stilted modes of  expression, and it made it that much harder to get through.  But even with  a sympathetic translation don't for a moment believe you'll get swept away  by the plot.	1999-03-19

The dialogue is particularly innocuous, inartistic and obvious.  Nothing of any interest happens in the  entire first half of the book -- just Southerners caught in the act of  being themselves.  National Geographic stuff.  Then, thankfully, voodoo  enters the picture, and we finally have a decently interesting subject to  attend to.  Believe me, it is this book's sole saving grace.  But it comes  way too late and reenters the narrative way too infrequently.  Had Berendt  focused on the voodoo, he might have produced a genuinely interesting work,  instead of this slumbering hulk of a book and its curious band of admirers  (none of whom have obviously read a REAL Southern book, like Faulkner's  &quot;Light in August&quot;).

In the four-tape abridgment I heard, Grisham still produces an attention-getting -- and attention-keeping -- novel, but I'm beginning to find the pattern of his books annoyingly similar.

The craftsmanship in the writing is unusually good, poetry and all.  It's  ultimately the content that is the major problem -- a long story with lots  of parallel events, the way a real Brothers Grimm story might proceed.   Doesn't seem to have much of an ending.  The character of the king is  striking, if you want your king to look like Brian Blessed in the first  Black Adder on TV.

This book is a real humdinger!  A sort of primer on slavery in the modern age with a lot of Christian moralizing thrown in, the book is nonetheless  powerful, at least as involving and occasionally as violent as  &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; and every bit as unrelenting.  Besides a  ripping good story, what can today's reader find?  A haunting case made for  never assuming you are in the right.  Just look at all those people back  then who said slavery was a natural thing.  How wrong they were.  That much  is obvious to us now.  But what about today's controversies?  To future  generations how obviously wrong can we be (1) about abortion, (2) about  Clinton's impeachment, or (3, my favorite) how we are turning our back on  injustices in Rwanda, Kosovo, and Chechniya.  What will history say about  us if we turn out to be on the wrong side of any of these issues?  Oh, and  please meet the real Uncle Tom -- what nobility, and not a shuffle in  sight.

The book also spends an inordinate  number of pages musing about the reintroduction of the use of corporal  punishment into our society in the future, the problem with &quot;juvenile  delinquents,&quot; and the problem with prohibiting &quot;cruel and unusual  punishment.&quot;  Well, if you thought the military shtick was boring...!

But the book is flawed by the arbitrary construction of its content and by its dwelling on the personalities and hypocrisies of the  &quot;bad guys,&quot; which are ultimately beside the point.  Gingrich's  and Limbaugh's personal lives do not have a bearing on Clinton's tendencies  to womanize, nor on Whitewater, and dwelling on their lives only makes the  liberal case look weaker.

I'd like to think that the problem I had staying interested in this novel was because it was rendered into stilted English (&quot;One sees...&quot; ought to be rendered &quot;You see...&quot;  But  Giovanni Pontiero never did.)  But I suspect that the wooden prose is not  the only problem.  After a few pages of showing us that medieval people  lived with the same onerous self-interest and benign amorality with which  modern people live, readers may begin to get restless:  &quot;Okay, so your  point is...?&quot;  But it just goes on like that.  Saramago's plot has  magic happening in it, but it is the magic found in Woody Allen's plots for  his movies &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; --  and about as interesting.  Very few authors can combine magic and gritty  realism and bring it off, but Saramago isn't one of them.  The blurb refers  to Saramago's &quot;loving tolerance of human folly,&quot; and that's about  as close as you can get to something distinguishing worth oohing and aahing  over (following the road the king takes to bankrupting his nation is  bracing).  Otherwise, there are lots of real 5-star novels out there.  Read  one of those instread.	1998-11-12

The only recommendation I had for this book was the ever-evolving readers' list that Random House is keeping on-line, which tallies the votes of what readers believe are the 100 best English language novels of the 20th  Century.  &quot;Pnin&quot; showed up near the bottom of the list, but with  a respectable number of votes.  Having always wanted to get past the  Nabokov of &quot;Lolita&quot; fame, I took the plunge.  What I found  knocked my socks off.  If you know ANY Russian intelligencia emigres, you  know Timofei Pnin.  Pnin is an unsubtle chucklehead with a heart of gold  who manages to live a great deal of his life in an academic cocoon, as  utterly clueless about how he is being arbitrarily protected by his dean as  he is clueless about the comic effect he has on others.  Doesn't sound  promising?  Believe me, Nabokov's deft brush turns this slender thread of  an idea into a veritable War-and-Peace of an exercise in how we react to  others in our life.  Dare we laugh at others?  We certainly laugh at Pnin.   We howl.  How dare we?  I place this book among the top five percent of the  many books I've read over the last five years.	1998-10-31

Taking as his  model the Odyssey of Homer, Virgil traces the wanderings of Aeneas, hero of  the Trojan Wars, as he wends his way toward Italy and his destiny -- to  found Rome.  Along the way he falls in love with Queen Dido of Carthage.   There are lots of scenes of battles and one-on-one fighting, and they are  occasionally more gory than Homer ever was (or perhaps it just seems that  way because we know more about the victims' psyches than we did with  Homer's characters).  Be prepared for a rather abrupt ending, but the good  news is you won't have to wade through obsequies and other formalisms in a  denouement that could only have been anticlimactic.  The prose translation  I heard (on the Blackstone unabridged tapes) was undoubtedly accurate but  not very noble.  Someday I'll try it again with a poetic version.	1998-08-22

Updike superbly captures the 20th Century male dilemma in these four books:  How should a guy be true to himself YET a caring lover YET an effective father?  How can he survive in a continuously and subtly hostile world of work so that he can still hold his head high?  Rabbit's answer is to take everything one step at a time, to react, sure, but also to control when it is important to do so.  As the ad for &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; says, (something like) &quot;Piglet frets and Eeyore resigns himself, but Pooh just IS.&quot;  Rabbit Angstrom is like Pooh.  A guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do.  Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong.

Apart from that obvious weakness in the plot, though, this is still a pleasant book, and the reason Hilton gives us for Shangri-la's existence -- a refuge for civilization during the next war -- is a haunting one considering the book's being written so close to World War II, and then doubly haunting considering its eventual nullification by the atom bomb (whose effects could reach Shangri-la and destroy it along with the rest of the world).  The novel is somewhat long on talk and short on action, and all but the main character are too one-dimensional (hence I must downgrade to a &quot;6&quot;), but you're still better off reading it than not.

With all that, it's very hard not to fall into an abject slumber and then to wake up fervently wishing this particular read was all over.  Hey, you want a good book about a guy who gets picked up at sea and gets forced to work for his keep?  &quot;The Sea Wolf,&quot; of course!  It's a 10!	1998-05-20

If you can treat it like a TV skit and simply accept it, you may have fun with this book.  My wife certainly did, and toward the end I too found a smile on my face as I bought increasingly into the book's absurdities, like a mathematician smiling at a student's interesting but ultimately flawed computations.  So I give it a &quot;5&quot; for the good times.	1998-05-17

But this send-up of the Sherlock Holmes genre never really gets off the ground.  A send-up should be funny.  But there is too much in the plot that is evil and dark, so Holmes' appearance -- and his incorrect solution -- become merely annoying.  The reader on the tape version does what he can to keep things moving along, but he cannot stifle the inevitable feeling in the listener that this is Twain churning out words for money.  Still, it IS Twain after all, and so it does have its moments.  Just not enough of them.	1998-05-16

Listening on my long trip to work on the train, I found it an unusually compelling and at times gripping reading, very professionally performed indeed, and of a story that is current and valid in our TV age.  It reminded me a lot of how John Grisham sounds on audiotape.  The only difference is, Grisham finishes his story.  At the end of this tape there is still much to tell.  It's not something that could be put in a sequel either; it belongs in this book.  Well, let it be; it was still quite an experience.	1998-05-06

If you are skittish about this rewrite of Willi Apel's classic dictionary, don't be.  Yes, it does have a host of non-European entries, politically correct in this age of diversity.  No, it does not overwhelm (nor does it inconvenience you in reaching) the European material you need to get your hands on quickly.  Recently amazon.com raised its price for this book by a couple of dollars.  Believe me, it's still an incredible bargain.  Even if it weren't on sale at all, it would still be a book that any serious music student would want to own and consult frequently.  I've owned the new Groves Dictionary ever since it came out, and guess what: some entries that do not appear in Groves do appear in the New Harvard Dictionary!	1998-05-01

In fact, the image fits perfectly -- one to one.  And that's all right.  But unfortunately it has the effect of minimizing another aspect of the novel that is ultimately far more rewarding:  Lang's brilliant ruminations on the subject of... just about everything he encounters.  Again and again (like five times per page), the story comes to a grinding halt while Lang comments on the absurdity of the moment.  These comments are not only laugh-out-loud hilarious, but they can also survive the kind of critical scrutiny usually lavished on Louis Carroll's conundrums and brain teasers.  You'll do yourself a disservice if you make this book a &quot;quick read.&quot;  Throw each of these comments about from one brain cell to another (like the way you slosh wine around your mouth during those wine tastings you abhor but seem to attend anyway) and see if you don't agree they're worth the attention.  The plot isn't too bad, but it is definitely merely a vehicle for Lang's observations of his peculiar world.  A better plot would have forced me to award a 10 to this otherwise quite perfect specimen of a book.	1998-04-22

Now, nearing 50, I have been finding that many of these old English novels are great fun and can occasionally even be very moving (&quot;Silas Marner&quot; knocked me clean out!).  What you will find distinctive about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is its surprising violence.  The title tells it all:  Yes, &quot;wuthering&quot; is an alternative spelling of &quot;weathering&quot; -- we have entered the heights of wearing-down.  You will find it incredible the depths Heathcliff sinks to in order to exercise his obsession.  Bodily violence, to be sure, but also, and mainly, torture of the soul.  You will shake with revulsion and frustration when reading of the wrongs Heathcliff perpetrates.  Can anything good come out of this Hell on Earth?  Will the violence follow its winding path ever downward?  Ah, but that's for you to discover.  Hunker down and go for it.  This ain't no sippin' novel.	1998-04-11

We all have ghosts from our past, but Harry's ghosts, we come to understand, revolve around a lady he has known since junior high.  As he reconciles himself to his past, and to these ghosts, Harry arrives gracefully, bravely, at the only logical conclusion there is for him.  The journey there is pure poetry, and Bellow's work in the smaller novella form is a gift to us all.  We need to cherish this book and learn its quiet, solid lessons.  I read it twice straight through so I could savor its opening pages all the more.	1998-04-02

But Still Top Notch	Fry's protagonist, in this, his third novel, is a young student of history.  Largely gone are the curmudgeons who populated his first and second novels and the liveliness that such characters inevitably bring to the action at hand.  Many characters are even downright nice (in the TV sense of being ultimately good-hearted).  So get used to a different Fry:  more circumspect, more innocent.  Throw in some minor time travel and consequent alternate history, all very &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; with relatively predictable insights about the human condition.  (Was it Oppenheimer who said something like, &quot;The world is going to hell, but the worst thing we could do is try to do something about it&quot;?)  For the first time, too, Fry is guilty of producing a quantity of filler, hence my lowered rating.  But, you know, a bad day playing golf is still better than a good day at work, and a marginally disappointing Fry novel still stands head and shoulders over most of his peers' efforts.  Read &quot;The Liar&quot; and &quot;The Hippopotamus&quot; first, if you haven't already.  They're exhilarating, without qualification.  Then ingest this book.  You'll still count it a first-class pleasure.	1998-04-01

Where most writers would be content to say, &quot;'Excuse me,' he said sarcastically,&quot; Stephen King always seems inclined to say something like, &quot;Wayne stood like a character in an old TV show that he could no longer quite identify -- and that bugged him no end -- he stood there and uttered a long 'Excu-u-use ME!'  But nobody, least of all the people sharing the same supermarket checkout line, paid him the slightest attention.  'I will kill them all,' he thought darkly.  But even then he knew he really wouldn't.&quot;  You get the idea.  Stephen King needs an editor, and needs one bad.  The four novellas in this collection are, for the most part, skillfully conceived, they flow nicely, and they are capable (in their better moments) of taking you where souls normally fear to tread.  &quot;The Langoliers&quot; is especially delightful because it is also a bit of an intellectual exercise.  I'd give it an 8 -- King at his best.  It is followed by &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden,&quot; the worst of the four, a tired old saga about a writer pestered by a guy who claims he stole his story.  It gets a 3.  &quot;The Library Policeman&quot; is initially spellbinding, but King keeps writing nonsense long after he could have stopped.  It's a 6.  &quot;The Sun Dog,&quot; which closes the collection, is impossibly wordy, but is saved somewhat by an ending that is guaranteed to give you goose bumps.  It's also a 6.  In short, it's a fun read, but it could have been better.  All it needed was tightening up.	1998-01-24

You take one look at the guy and you don't want to read about him.  Suppress that urge.  This book is best seen as a continuation of &quot;Lake Wobegon Days.&quot;  It is a story of one of Lake Wobegon's own, out in the big world, trying to make sense of it, trying to choose whether to embrace some of society's newest trends or to declare them hogwash.  Other people's advice, usually contradictory, is not much help.  John Tollefson makes his choices, lives to regret some, finds that he has rendered himself impotent by others, and celebrates the success of still others.  Just like us.  The underlying thread of the book seems to be an examination of a society that can produce the modern monster of talk radio, people turning so far into themselves and taking themselves and their group so seriously that they become impossible to deal with.  This society is juxtaposed with the timeless society of Lake Wobegon, still thriving, though the old folks are dying off.  Yes, there's plenty of Lake Wobegon in this book, and some of it you may have already heard on Saturday afternoon (which may make some readers feel cheated -- not me).  My advice:  Read this thoroughly entertaining book and, if you wish, take its delicate message to heart.  Thirty years from now they'll be calling &quot;Wobegon Boy&quot; a classic.	1998-01-16

Now, from the same weirdos who brought you Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Don Juan comes this remarkably lifeless account of how one ought to achieve self-actualization.  I suppose for those who need some kind of jump-start to their torpid, dull lives this book could perhaps get you out of the trailer park, but for those of us who long ago forswore the wonders of talk radio and talk TV and preferred instead to live our lives, this book is insanely inept and sinfully boring.  It is badly written, with undeveloped characters who all speak serviceable English even in the depths of the Peruvian mountains.  Characters are killed off indiscrimanately.  Others are allowed to live on.  There is no sense to the plot.  And the plot is a clumsy, unsubtle vehicle for espousing a philosophy of living in peace and harmony on the planet.  That's the nice thing:  Lots of people will read this book and maybe waste their time trying to practice this go-nowhere philosophy.  Meanwhile, I'll be hitching a ride on the grim (but real) capitalist bandwagon and moving toward a comfortable retirement.  Let's face it, folks.  We tried that peace-and-love route in the 60's.  Then the hippies became yuppies, and we're worse off now than ever.  The Celestine Prophecy's nine points will not put bread on your table when you're seventy.  You can't even read this book for a good yuk.  I only found one, and I had to supply the punch line from another source:  When one of the points suggested seeing the aura of living things in the dim twilight, I was reminded of Gilbert and Sullivan's quote of a crusty old judge trying to make his elderly ugly daughter seem great marriage material:  &quot;She may very well pass for forty-three in the dusk with the light behind her.&quot;  Put this book in the dusk with the light behind it.  I guarantee you:  NO AURA.  Reason?  Dead book.	1998-01-02

An English gentleman is forcibly retired from a job as bank branch manager and is looking forward to a quiet end of his life, when into his life bounces his elderly aunt, a world-traveler and bon-vivant.  She proceeds to shake up his staid existence, and to make it abundantly clear that he ought either to join her in her reckless and dangerous travels or continue to roll downhill to a certain, but dull end.  Lucky for us readers he chooses the former, though not without grave misgivings.  The message here is to all of us middle-agers:  Do you really want to stop living?  A tempting, juicy tale, and Graham Greene is outstandingly good in the telling, at his best, really.  The characters we meet along the way are unforgettable.  So sink down in your easy chair and relish this breath of fresh air from a master of the form.	1997-12-31

Nevertheless, I've heard plenty of abridged versions of books on tape that have propelled me toward the whole book.  This one repelled me.  The characters are tired cliches, the situations aren't terribly original, and the writing (the expressions used, the occasional metaphor) is sub-par.  The main character, Hiro Tanaka, is oddly inconsistent.  (I suppose you could say that about a lot of people, but why waste your time reading about them.)  The fact that much of the action occurs in the artists' colony on a Georgian island is particularly a source of displeasure.  Please, authors, stop writing about yourselves and your craft and your trade!  Two points off just for that.  Don't buy this book without giving it a good look-over first.

It is about death coming as a certainty.  At every turn the reader must examine his or her own feelings about the imminent fate of him- or herself.  That's what really makes this book so incredibly powerful.  You won't find any techno-thriller stuff here, and you won't miss it.  It's about us, now, as we seek to find a meaning in life while trying to live it.  This book will be around for a very long time, not because it describes so heartbreakingly the nuclear winter that is our potential future, but because it describes our life -- and our death --even without such a disaster.  Read it. Savor it.  It is the stuff of life.	1997-12-16
