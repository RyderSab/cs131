This is my second Marian Keyes book and I now at the point where I need to read the rest of her books.<br />Lisa - What a pain the behind, from the start I wasn't to sure what I would think of her, but for most of the book I felt that she was just a bitter woman with a lot to deal with. She at times never seem to care about anyone or anything but her self. But towards the end my feelins for her changed, but she still was the same old way. I felt that she was never truly happy working at Colleen, but that she dealt with it as best she could.<br />Ashling - I felt a that the story revolved around her and her life. She is Little Miss Fix It, always carrying around her bag with bandages, tape and so forth. At times I felt that was a goody good. But her life never was too predictable, she was just happy to be back working for magazine doing what she liked. Her love life was one you read about all the time and sometimes seemed a little preditable, but somteimes it took a turn and changed. Her friendships with Joy and Ted were wonderful and her friendship with Clodagh was good, but it had it bad parts.<br />Clodagh - In my opinion she was a whiney woman, who was just out for herself. She lived what would be the good life to a lot people. She was married and had two kids. But in her world it wasn't good enough so she had to take things to the extreme and screw up a lot with her life and other peoples lives.<br />Overall this book was wonderful, I loved how the three charactors and all the supporting charactors acted and how there storys seem to come together at the end.<br />I can't wait to read more from Marian Keyes	2003-06-03

I think it mainly to do with the fact that I really couldn't stand Ripley. I felt most of the time Ripley was just putting up this shield around her life to protect from everything and when things got to unstable for her she up it up tighter and resisted many things.<br />I did like Mac and how he dealt with Ripley, I felt that he cared about Ripley more thens she ever realized and ever will. He brought out some of the good strengths in Ripley. I also liked how he protected her things. There were times I felt like smacking Ripley around and telling her here is a guy who would do anything for you and you just want to push him away further and further.<br />Overall I enjoyed how the story moved, there were times I felt it was a bit drawn out. But it still kept me reading and wanting to read the next book.<br />Nora Roberts is an excellent writer and I look forward to reading Face The Fire and some of her other work.	2002-08-18

I finally decided to take the plunge and start it. From what I had heard this was suppose to be one of the best books out there. Well I think maybe I might be a minority but I found the book to be on the so-so level.<br />At first I thought things were good. The author was talking about how the fast food restaurants came around and how they came to power and there owners and so forth. This was what I was after. I've been eating at fast food places all my life and wanted to know the story behind them and how they came to be and how they were run.<br />The second half of the book wasn't too bad, but alot of the stuff I read in this book I've read in other places. Some of it was disturbing and some of it was true. But overall this at times I felt didn't have much to do with the fast food industry. I know that they get there beef from places and how it comes to them.<br />The last part of this book about how the fast food industry is around the world bored me to tears. It was too long winded and I felt it could have been put together in about 3 pages or less.<br />Overall this book didn't change my opinion of fast food food or how it is cooked. I still will eat out at this places.<br />I felt the author could have done a better job with the book and focused more on the fast food industry it's self and less on the beef, potatoes, and chicken.<br />Overall this wasn't a terrible book, but not what I expected. I would recommend this book to friends, because I know a lot of people haven't read books about stuff like this.	2002-08-15

I was very happy to have read this book. The characters were a riot and Libby had me laughing alot.<br />Libby Mason is 27 years old working in PR and of course looking for someone that she date and hopefully fall in love with. Well she meets Nick the guy who rocks her world, but just isn't the type Libby normally goes for. He doesn't work, he doesn't have a lot of money and Libby just can't stand his friends and of course his flat is just what she thought it would be a pigsty, but Libby can't ignore the fact that Nick is gorgeous and satisfys her in bed. With all that what more could a girl like Libby want.<br />Well Libby has always wanted a man who could care for her finacally, and who loves her and wants her around. Then Libby meets Ed. Ed is what she would call her dream man, well aside the fact that he has a ugly mustache, snotty friends, and is way to straight for her and of course he can't satisfy her like Nick could (not even after speed reading the Joy Of Sex). But he does take care of Libby and show her what she has always wanted. As time goes on and more time Libby spends with Ed she realizes that he might not just be the one for her, but what is it that Libby wants.<br />Libby at times I felt was a bit snobbish herself, but that made her just a bit more loveable. I loved her best friend Jules and how she was always there to help Libby out. The friends Libby had were a great group always there to show Libby things. Libbys mum was a riot, just wanting her daughter to marry Ed so that she could say that her daughter had bagged the most eligiable man in London, but as time goes on she realizes that her daughter knows what she wants.<br />Jane Green's writing is wonderful her books always make me laugh and they are a quick read.<br />Overall Mr. Maybe was a quick read and I love the genre of books like this. Single girl, meets guy, great set of friends. I can't get enough of them even if after a while they become very predictiable.hem even if after a while they become very predictiable.	2002-08-11

Well I think what I heard was right. The books was ok, but at times I found myself forcing myself to read this book.<br />The Chandler brothers are 3 men who are known as the wild children in there town of Yorkshire Falls, New York.

Roman also realizes some things and makes some changes for the better and goes on with other things.<br />The only real funny parts of the story at times were about the panty raider. That made me laugh.<br />This book has little charactor development and the people in the book seem flat. The only charactor out of the whole book I really liked was Beth and that was because she realized some things in her life.<br />Overall this book was boring I knew what would happen and couldnt have predicted any better then it had happen.	2002-07-31

When I first heard about this book I was interested to read this book and thought it would be a quick and intersting book. I was wrong.. well it was a quick read but interesting that it was not.<br />The charactors in this book have no depth or life to them. Well besides there rampate drug usage and partying. Miranda was a whining 19 year old girl.<br />There was no real plot for this book. It just went from one end to the other and back again. The story line could have better if there was more depth to it but I just don't think it would have made the book any better.<br />I had to force myself to finish the book after putting it down. Overall I hope that this author picks another subject to write on and possibly puts some more time into it.<br />I can't really say I would give this book to anyone.	2002-05-24

Rebecca has the same idea I have, why worry about paying off that debt just go out and buy yourself something to make you feel better.<br />Now onto the book. Rebecca has a job that doesn't make as much money as she needs. She struggles to find something that makes her more money. She takes a few jobs but at all of them she fails out. Finally she hits a point in her life where she can't escape and she has to finally figure out ways, after a few bad choices she finally comes upon something that is just right for her and everything works out just fine.<br />Overall this was a very quick and light read. I would recommend this to anyone who is in debt and needs a good pick me up.<br />I can't wait for next book about Rebecca.	2001-12-20

Jane seem to be a cross between Bridget Jones and alot of the other female's in british chick lit.<br />Jane is almost 30 and still has found her Mr. Right, and has to face the fact that almost everyone around her is either A) married B) engaged C) or not intersted in dating. Jane reminds me of alot of females I know always on the look out for that perfect man to make everyone else look at her.<br />She starts out with her blind dates. Which I thought were very funny in the way she handled them. I love Jane and her friends and her thought about work and the people she worked with and had to do work with.<br />Overall the book was wonderful and great book for a first time writer. I hope to see more books just like this.	2001-12-19

This book is the pefect book to read with some cookies and a blanket wrapped around you.<br />The story starts out a bit slow but towards the middle of the book it really picks up and you feel like you don't want to leave the characters behind.<br />I enjoyed almost all the characters alot, but I wasn't a huge Elfrida fan, she on times got on my nerves because she didn't seem to be as likeable as Lucy, Carrie, Oscar or Sam. Lucy would have to be my favorite person in the story. To see her change and be so much different then what she was wonderful. Carrie and Sam both were wonderful in how they both finally realized things in there life weren't as bad as they looked. Oscar was a man who had so much hurt in his life, but went through life with a newfound attitude and look on life.<br />I want to know what happen to everyone. Carrie, Sam, Lucy and Oscar. I hope maybe there will be more about each of in another book.<br />Overall this was a wonderful book, even though towards the begaining I wasn't to thrilled with the book, but at the end I was in love with the book and all the characters.	2001-12-17

Then in the middle of the book it picked up for a while with what with the family and where they had gone.<br />The end of the book was sort of what I had predicited would happen.<br />It was good but this is a book I can't see ever reading again or really recommening to anyone unless they like very depressing books.<br />Overall I've tried to read more from this author only to get the same feeling from most of her books.	2001-12-15

The story of this book is something that a lot of people would want to do. Skip Christmas<br />Luther and Nora are a typical family. Taking a lot of time to celebrate Christmas and later regretting it. Luther at times in this book seem to get a little bit out of hand with the whole idea of skipping chrismas.<br />Overall the best parts of the book were the Frosty parts and of couse I loved the last 50 or so pages of the book.<br />This was a good quick read.	2001-12-04

Abby later on in her life moves away from home and her belief's in the church, and her father he just runs away because he has enough problems in his life to deal with.<br />The way the author went back and told a lot of what happen between the family and Sam made the book go at a fast pace. I was always wanting to know what happen and what went on. As you follow Abby in her life you realize just how much it hurt her to not be with her brother and to not know where he was.<br />Overall this book was wonderful and had some very good points in it.	2001-12-01

The Hobbit is a wonderful book, it was very well written and very descriptave.<br />Fantasy novels have never been my style of reading, I have found them not to be my choice of reading. I figured I would start out with The Hobbit and try to read Lord Of The Rings.<br />Bilbo Baggins the hobbit in the story had a lot to go through and had a great adventure with the dwarves. The storyline moved quickly and was enjoyable.<br />My only downfall with this book was the fact that I have a hard time thinking of fantasy in my mind. So I would be lost at times with all the charactors.<br />Overall I can't wait to start Lord Of The Rings sooner or later.	2001-11-28

As someone who is to a point not religious in anyway. I found this book to be very good.

This book has it all.<br />The story is one that would only seem to be something you would see in the movies.<br />I don't want to give to much away in spoiler, but all I have to say is to read this book and give it some thought. I had kept away from these books due to the fact that they were in the religion section of my bookstore, but having borrowed this from a friend all I have to say is I can't wait to read the rest in the series. I only hope that this was a start to a wonderful set of book that I will enjoy and recommend to others.	2001-11-27

Overall this book starts off great but I felt towards the middle of the story the book begain to slow down and just repeat the same story over and over just in a new situation.<br />Katie I felt was at times just whining woman who wanted things to go her way and got upset when her husband tried to change his life and she couldn't feel like she was part of it. David, well he changed a lot and there was a lot I didn't like about what he changed. There is extreme point where he got annoying. Sure it was nice to give some of the stuff they had to people who didn't have any and sure give some money to the homeless, but when he started spending all his time with Goodnews and changing the views of his children is where I got annoyed.<br />Overall this book had sort of a poor ending with much more said about what had happen and what was going to happen.	2001-11-21

I read this book a while ago and never got around to reviewing it but I felt it was time to.<br />From the start of this book I was pulled into the story. Ellen I felt was a weak person who just took whatever came to her and just went with the flow. I felt that Mary-Margeret and her husband were tough on there children and sometimes didn't realize it.<br />James on the other hand was just like Ellen weak in himself and couldn't stand up much to his parents.<br />Overall this was a quick read and I enjoyed the book a lot but it isn't a book I could pick up again.

I know this a book, but she at times was very naieve in things that happen to her and what she did.<br />The best part of the book overall would be the end for me and the way she finally managed to connect with her father who seemed like he expected so much from her and that is why he was so tough on her.

Well this is a story of a woman Jemima Jones who in the start is overweight and head over heels for Ben Williams. IT starts off a little bit slow with her daily life and what she does and how she does it but towards the middle of the book it picks up.<br />I loved the way Jemima started chatting with Brad online but I felt that there was much more that should have been told about what happen between her and Brad before she went out to California. But when she got in her head to lose the weight the story picked up. It is very much like many woman who try to lose weight they go and work out and get down to the weight they wanted.<br />Well in the end I think that what Brad did to her was terrible and that her friendship with Lauren really made the book flow well because she needed another woman there to be able to convey what she was feeling. And in the end I loved how she found Ben and how she got to go back to London and be with Ben.<br />I can't wait to read more from Jane Green.	2001-11-02

So she heads off to Dublin to stay with her family.<br />At times in this book some of what happen just didn't seem possible to me for a woman who is getting over being left by her husband. Claire was strong at times but at other times I felt she was very weak in some of her choices. James on the other hand I felt was a jerk who needed to get a life. Claires family was a riot her sister Helen who seem to have more life problems and they always seem to be more important that Claire's. Anna who seem to be off in her own world and of couse Claire parents they reminded me of my own parents who still look out for me. Overall I felt that this book was a wonderful quick read and kept me into the story always wanting to know more about what was going to happen to Claire of what she would say.<br />Overall the reason why I only gave this book 4 stars was because I felt that there a lot left out and there could have been a lot to go with the story.	2001-10-27

The story of Hank and Julie was so moving.<br />Julie strength to go on after her brother and father wer egone. Also her courage to deal with all of what happen to her, makes her such a strongh woman.<br />I've read a lot of books about woman like Julie, but always in the end the story turns out to work out, they move away and go on with there lives living richer and happier. All problems solved.<br />But this book left with such a open ended story.  I would recommend this book to anyone.	2000-09-25

I made the mistake of doing that. The book goes into more depth then the movie now don't get me wrong the movie is wonderful it follows the book wonderfully but Hunter S. Thompson is a wonderful writer with so much to  say and the way he writes made me laugh. By all means read this book	2000-05-04

I first heard about this book way before it was an Oprah book but I just never got around to reading it. I let everyone borrow my copy before I actully read it. I picked up the book again a few weeks ago and put in my to read list and well actully I read it. I remember starting to read it  many months before and always finding something else to do, well this time  I picked it up and finished it in three days. This book was amazing I cried  a few times in the book and wanted to scream a few times but this book was  wonderful. the main charactor reminded me of a close friend I had in high  school and still keep in contact I thought about how she had struggled with  her life and how things were not going well. I would totally recommend  reading ths book it is one of the best out there I've read. I'm off to go  pick up something else out my to read pile.	2000-05-04

I have always enjoyed reading the book even thou in the past couple of years I've lost the passion for them that I use to have. I remember as a teen running into  the bookstores at the mall and asking if she had a new book and buying and  taking it home and reading in a week because I took in every word she wrote  and loved it. But now the books to me are just something there for me to  read. This book is good the charactors were decent I liked Rain in the  novel but wasn't a big fan of Beni and so forth. I'll always continue to  read her books untill I get so bored with them I will have the heart to  part with them. Till then looking somewhat forward to the next book.	2000-05-04

Well as the years passed on I kept the book on my bookcase and would look at it from time to time and want to read it again but didn't  have time to. Well just picked up two nights ago in a matter of about a  nine hour spread I had finished the book again and remembered how much I  love this book and how in high school I could totally related to the  charactors in the book and how there lives were. I would recommond picking  up this book and reading it.	2000-05-04
US	50746081	RKVYE58FS6AEB	0679746048	92211220	Girl, Interrupted	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Made me think.	I picked this book after I was told I had panic disorder and I was semi-manic depressive. I kept putting off reading this book because I didn't want to read about someone else's crazy life while mine was just as  crazy. But when I picked it up I was amazed that I could almsot related to  the book. I know that when you are young you go thru times where you don't  know where you are going or what you want to do. Well that summed me up  right there. I was one of the few people in my class that didn't go on to  college but I still went on about life. The charactors in the book are so  true, I felt I could related to Susanna and knew what was going on.<br />I  luckly enough read the book before I went to the movies to see it. I was  glad I had because the book and movie were differnt. The actrescess in the  movie were the best Ryder is wonderful and Jolie she deserved that Oscar  for her role in the movie it has to be on the best movies I've seen her in.  I also liked the girl who played Daisy and Georgina. :)	2000-04-27

I picked up this book on a long trip and started it and got so imersed by the story I didn't want to do anything on my trip but read it. The book is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I loved the way the boys  told the story of the girls because it made it much better then a story of  the girls telling about the suicides and why they did them. The lives  theses girls lead touched me and made me wonder about others in my life. I  would tell my friends to read this book because I am glad I did. I am also  glad I read it before I went to see the movie because the book I have a  feeling will be much better then the movie. :)	2000-04-27

I read countless books when I was child and still contiune to read all the time. I happen to be on a trip home and went to the bookstore to find something new to read and had heard all about theses books and decided what the heck why not pick  it up and give it a read. I got to my hotel and put it on my bed and  decieded to start to read it before bed. Let me say I couldn't go to sleep  I stayed up for 4 hours reading it and was just left in amazment with this  book. Needless to say I read it all the way home. I got home and immeditaly  went to get the other two books. I started the second book two nights ago  and finished it tonight and will most likly start the third on tommorrow  and hopefully will love it as much as I loved the others. Harry Potter  books are a wonderful way for me to escape the real world problems in my  life and slip into a world of fantasy and fun.	1999-12-19
